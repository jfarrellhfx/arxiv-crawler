<h3>Topologically stable ergodicity breaking from emergent higher-form  symmetries in generalized quantum loop models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04792" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04792</a>

<i>Charles Stahl, Rahul Nandkishore, Oliver Hart</i>

We present a set of generalized quantum loop models which provably exhibit
topologically stable ergodicity breaking. These results hold for both periodic
and open boundary conditions, and derive from a one-form symmetry (notably not
being restricted to sectors of extremal one-form charge). We identify simple
models in which this one-form symmetry can be emergent, giving rise to the
aforementioned ergodicity breaking as an exponentially long-lived prethermal
phenomenon. We unveil a web of dualities that connects these models, in certain
limits, to models that have previously been discussed in the literature. We
also identify nonlocal conserved quantities in such models that correspond to a
pattern of system-spanning domain walls, and which are robust to the addition
of arbitrary $k$-local perturbations.

This article reviews the recent developments in the theory of generalised

discuss the implications of GHD on the mechanisms of thermalisation in
integrable quantum many-body systems as well as its ability to describe
far-from-equilibrium behaviour of integrable and near integrable systems in a
variety of quantum quench scenarios. We outline the experimental tests of GHD
in cold-atom gases and its benchmarks with other microscopic theoretical

<h3>Writing in Water</h3>

Writing is an ancient communication technique dating back at least 30,000
years. While even sophisticated contemporary writing techniques hinge on solid
surfaces for engraving or the deposition of ink, writing within a liquid medium
requires a fundamentally different approach. We here demonstrate writing of
lines, letters and complex patterns in water by assembling lines of colloidal
particles. Exploiting gravity, we roll an ion-exchange bead (pen) across a
layer of sedimented colloidal particles (ink). The pen evokes a hydrodynamic
flow collecting ink-particles into a durable, high-contrast line along its
trajectory. Deliberate substrate-tilting sequences facilitate pen-steering and
thus to draw and write. We complement our experiments with a minimal model that
quantitatively predicts the observed parameter dependence for writing in fluids
and highlights the generic character of writing by line-assembly. Overall, our
approach opens a versatile route for writing, drawing and patterning fluids,
even at the micro-scale.

<h3>Proof of a Stable Fixed Point for Strongly Correlated Electron Matter</h3>

We establish the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as a stable quartic fixed point
(distinct from Wilson-Fisher) by computing the $\beta-$function in the presence
of perturbing local interactions. In vicinity of the half-filled doped Mott
state, the $\beta-$function vanishes for all local interactions regardless of
their sign. The only flow away from the HK model is through the superconducting
channel which lifts the spin degeneracy as does any ordering tendency. The
superconducting instability is identical to that established
previously\cite{nat1}. A corollary of this work is that Hubbard repulsive
interactions flow into the HK stable fixed point in the vicinity of
half-filling. Consequently, although the HK model has all-to-all interactions,
nothing local destroys it. The consilience with Hubbard arises because both
models break the $Z_2$ symmetry on a Fermi surface, the HK model being the
simplest to do so. Indeed, the simplicity of the HK model belies its robustness
and generality.

<h3>Chiral chains with two valleys and disorder of finite correlation length</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04808" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04808</a>
<br>
<i>Jean-Baptiste Touchais, Pascal Simon, Andrej Mesaros</i>

<br>
In one-dimensional disordered systems with a chiral symmetry it is well-known
that electrons at energy $E = 0$ avoid localization and simultaneously exhibit
a diverging density of states (DOS). For $N$ coupled chains with
zero-correlation-length disorder, the diverging DOS remains for odd $N$, but a
vanishing DOS is found for even $N$. We use a thin spinless graphene nanotube
with disordered Semenoff mass and disordered Haldane coupling to construct $N =
2$ chiral chain models which at low energy have two linear band crossings at
different momenta $\pm K$ (two valleys) and disorder with an arbitrary
correlation length $\xi$ in units of lattice constant $a$. We find that the
finite momentum $\pm K$ forces the disorder in one valley to depend on the
disorder in the other valley, thus departing from known analytical results
which assume having $N$ independent disorders (whatever their spatial
correlation lengths). Our main numerical results show that for this
inter-dependent mass disorder the DOS is also suppressed in the limit of
strongly coupled valleys (lattice-white noise limit, $\xi/a = 0$) and exhibits
a non-trivial crossover as the valleys decouple ($\xi/a\gtrsim 5$) into the DOS
shapes of the $N = 1$ continuum model with finite correlation length $\xi$. We
also show that changing the intra-unit-cell geometry of the disordered Haldane
coupling can tune the amount of inter-valley scattering yet at lowest energies
it produces the decoupled-valley behavior ($N = 1$) all the way down to lattice
white noise.

<h3>A data-driven framework for structure-property correlation in ordered  and disordered cellular metamaterials</h3>

Cellular solids and micro-lattices are a class of lightweight architected
materials that have been established for their unique mechanical, thermal, and
acoustic properties. It has been shown that by tuning material architecture, a
combination of topology and solid(s) distribution, one can design new material
systems, also known as metamaterials, with superior performance compared to
conventional monolithic solids. Despite the continuously growing complexity of
synthesized microstructures, mainly enabled by developments in additive
manufacturing, correlating their morphological characteristics to the resulting
material properties has not advanced equally. This work aims to develop a
systematic data-driven framework that is capable of identifying all key
microstructural characteristics and evaluating their effect on a target
material property. The framework relies on integrating virtual structure
generation and quantification algorithms with interpretable surrogate models.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by analyzing the
effective stiffness of a broad class of two-dimensional (2D) cellular
metamaterials with varying topological disorder. The results reveal the complex
manner in which well-known stiffness contributors, including nodal
connectivity, cooperate with often-overlooked microstructural features such as
strut orientation, to determine macroscopic material behavior. We further
re-examine Maxwell's criteria regarding the rigidity of frame structures, as
they pertain to the effective stiffness of cellular solids and showcase
microstructures that violate them. This framework can be used for
structure-property correlation in different classes of metamaterials as well as
the discovery of novel architectures with tailored combinations of material
properties.

<h3>Consistent optical and electrical determination of carrier  concentrations for the accurate modeling of the transport properties of  n-type Ge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04815" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04815</a>
<br>
<i>José Menéndez, Chi Xu, John Kouvetakis</i>
<br>
<br>
A consistent methodology is presented to extract carrier concentrations in
n-type Ge from measurements of the infrared dielectric function and the Hall
effect. In the case of the optical measurements, usually carried out using
spectroscopic ellipsometry, the carrier concentration is affected by the doping
dependence of the conductivity effective mass, which is computed using a model
of the electronic density of states that accounts for non-parabolicity and is
fit to electronic structure calculations. Carrier concentrations obtained from
Hall measurements require a knowledge of the Hall factor, which is arbitrarily
set equal to unit in most practical applications. We have calculated the Hall
factor for n-Ge using a model that accounts for scattering with phonons and
with ionized impurities. We show that determinations of the carrier
concentration n using our computed effective mass and Hall factor virtually
eliminates any systematic discrepancy between the two types of measurement. We
then use these results to compute majority carrier mobilities from measured
resistivity values, to compare with measurements of minority carrier
mobilities, and to fit empirical expressions to the doping dependence of the
mobilities that can be used to model Ge devices.

<h3>Effect of Inversion Asymmetry on Bilayer Graphene's Superconducting and  Exciton Condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04825" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04825</a>
<br>
<i>Xiang Hu, Enrico Rossi, Yafis Barlas</i>
<br>
<br>
Inversion asymmetry in bilayer graphene can be tuned by the displacement
field. As a result, the band dispersion in biased bilayer graphene acquires
flat band regions near the Dirac points along with a non-trivial band geometry.
We analyze the effect of inversion symmetry on the critical temperature and
superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state of AB-stacked graphene
bilayer and on the exciton condensate in double layers formed by two AB-stacked
graphene bilayers. The geometric superfluid stiffness in bilayer graphene
superconductors is found to be negligible due to the small superconducting gap.
Furthermore, we show that the geometric superfluid stiffness is maximized for a
constant order parameter. Therefore, it can be neglected in biased bilayer
graphene superconductors with any pairing symmetry. However, the displacement
field enhances the geometric superfluid stiffness in exciton condensates. It is
most prominent at low densities and high displacement fields. A consequence of
the geometric superfluid stiffness is a modest enhancement of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in bilayer graphene's
exciton condensate.

<h3>Model-free characterization of topological edge and corner states in  mechanical networks</h3>

Topological materials can host edge and corner states that are protected from
disorder and material imperfections. In particular, the topological edge states
of mechanical structures present unmatched opportunities for achieving robust
responses in wave guiding, sensing, computation, and filtering. However,
determining whether a mechanical structure is topologically nontrivial and
features topologically-protected modes has hitherto relied on theoretical
models. This strong requirement has limited the experimental and practical
significance of topological mechanics to laboratory demonstrations. Here, we
introduce and validate an experimental method to detect the topologically
protected zero modes of mechanical structures without resorting to any modeling
step. Our practical method is based on a simple electrostatic analogy:
topological zero modes are akin to electric charges. To detect them, we
identify elementary mechanical molecules and measure their chiral polarization,
a recently introduced marker of topology in chiral phases. Topological zero
modes are then identified as singularities of the polarization field. Our
method readily applies to any mechanical structure and effectively detects the
edge and corner states of regular and higher-order topological insulators. Our
findings extend the reach of chiral topological phases beyond designer
materials, and allow their direct experimental investigation.

<h3>T-square electronic thermal resistivity in metallic strontium titanate</h3>

<br>
<br>
The temperature dependence of the phase space for electron-electron (e-e)
collisions leads to a T-square contribution to electrical resistivity of
metals. Umklapp scattering are identified as the origin of momentum loss due to
e-e scattering in dense metals. However, in dilute metals like lightly doped
strontium titanate, the origin of T-square electrical resistivity in absence of
Umklapp events is yet to be pinned down. Here, by separating electron and
phonon contributions to heat transport, we extract the electronic thermal
resistivity in niobium-doped strontium titanate and show that it also displays
a T-square temperature dependence. Its amplitude correlates with the T-square
electrical resistivity. The Wiedemann-Franz law strictly holds in the
zero-temperature limit, but not at finite-temperature, because the two T-square
prefactors are different by a factor of $\approx 3$, like in other Fermi
liquids. Recalling the case of $^3$He, we argue that T-square thermal
resistivity does not require Umklapp events. The approximate recovery of the
Wiedemann-Franz law in presence of disorder would account for a T-square
electrical resistivity without Umklapp.

<h3>Spin-phonon interactions and magnetoelectric coupling in  Co$_4$$B_2$O$_9$ ($B$ = Nb, Ta)</h3>

<br>
<br>
In order to explore the consequences of spin-orbit coupling on spin-phonon
interactions in a set of chemically-similar mixed metal oxides, we measured the
infrared vibrational properties of Co$_4B_2$O$_9$ ($B$ = Nb, Ta) as a function
of temperature and compared our findings with lattice dynamics calculations and
several different models of spin-phonon coupling. Frequency vs. temperature
trends for the Co$^{2+}$ shearing mode near 150 cm$^{-1}$ reveal significant
shifts across the magnetic ordering temperature that are especially large in
relative terms. Bringing these results together and accounting for
noncollinearity, we obtain spin-phonon coupling constants of -3.4 and -4.3
cm$^{-1}$ for Co$_4$Nb$_2$O$_9$ and the Ta analog, respectively. Analysis
reveals that these coupling constants derive from interlayer (rather than
intralayer) exchange interactions and that the interlayer interactions contain
competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions. At the same time,
beyond-Heisenberg terms are minimized due to fortuitous symmetry
considerations, different than most other 4$d$- and 5$d$-containing oxides.
Comparison with other contemporary oxides shows that spin-phonon coupling in
this family of materials is among the strongest ever reported, suggesting an
origin for magnetoelectric coupling.

<h3>Dimensional crossover on multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders</h3>

<br>

We study the ground state properties of a polarized two-component Fermi gas
on multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Using exact diagonalization and
density matrix renormalization group method simulations, we construct grand
canonical phase diagrams for ladder widths of up to $W=5$ and varying
perpendicular geometries, characterizing the quasi-one-dimensional regime of
the dimensional crossover. We unveil a multicritical point marking the onset of
partial polarization in those phase diagrams, a candidate regime of
finite-momentum pairing. We compare our findings with recent experimental and
theoretical studies of quasi-one-dimensional polarized Fermi gases.

<h3>Polaritons for testing the universality of an impurity in a  Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

<br>
<br>
Universality is a fundamental concept in physics that allows for the
description of properties of systems that are independent of microscopic
details. In this work, we show that polaritons in a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) are a suitable platform to probe in a non-demolition way the universal
high-energy spectrum of an impurity strongly coupled to a BEC. Based on a field
theory that includes the two-body correlations at the exact level we
demonstrate that under appropriate conditions, the damping rate of slow-light
propagation reveals the high-energy universal tail in the polaron spectrum.

<h3>A large deformation model for quasi-static to high strain rate response  of rate-stiffening soft polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04892" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04892</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Soft polymers and polymer gels that contain dynamic, reversible crosslinks
are rate-dependent materials used in applications ranging from biomedical to
structural protection. Their highly rate-dependent response, especially for
impact-mitigating structures, is important. Currently, there are no
physics-motivated constitutive models that can predict the large-deformation
elastic-viscoplastic response of these polymers at high loading rates (strain
rates $\sim$10$^{\text{3}}$ s$^{\text{-1}}$). To address this gap, we have
developed a constitutive model for rate-stiffening soft polymers with dynamic
crosslinks to predict their large strain, non-linear, loading-unloading, and
substantial rate-dependent response. We have conducted compression experiments
on polyborosiloxane (PBS), an important rate-stiffening soft polymer with
dynamic crosslinks, up to true strains of $\sim$125$\%$, over a wide strain
rate range of 10$^{\text{-3}}$ s$^{\text{-1}}$ to 10$^{\text{3}}$
s$^{\text{-1}}$. The model reasonably accurately captures the response of PBS
over six decades of strain rates. We propose boron-oxygen coordinate-bond
dynamic crosslinks with relaxation time constant $\tau \approx$ 3 s and
entanglements acting as dynamic crosslinks with $\tau \approx$ 0.001 s as the
two main types of crosslink mechanisms in PBS. We have outlined a numerical
update procedure to evaluate the convolution-like time integrals arising from
dynamic crosslink kinetics. The predictive capabilities of our model and its
finite element implementation are validated using experiments involving
three-dimensional inhomogeneous deformations.

<h3>From Disks to Channels: Dynamics of Active Nematics Confined to an  Annulus</h3>

<br>
<br>
Confinement can be used to systematically tame turbulent dynamics occurring
in active fluids. Although periodic channels are the simplest geometries to
study confinement numerically, the corresponding experimental realizations
require closed racetracks. Here, we computationally study 2D active nematics
confined to such a geometry -- an annulus. By systematically varying the
annulus inner radius and channel width, we bridge the behaviors observed in the
previously studied asymptotic limits of the annulus geometry: a disk and an
infinite channel. We identify new steady-state behaviors, which reveal the
influence of boundary curvature and its interplay with confinement. We also
show that, below a threshold inner radius, the dynamics are insensitive to
topological constraints imposed by boundary conditions. We explain this
insensitivity through a simple scaling analysis. Our work sheds further light
on design principles for using confinement to control the dynamics of active
nematics.

<h3>Sizable suppression of magnon Hall effect by magnon damping in  Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04922</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg honeycomb ferromagnets are expected to have
interesting topological magnon effects as their magnon dispersion can have
Dirac points. The Dirac points are gapped with finite second nearest neighbor
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, providing nontrivial Berry curvature with
finite magnon Hall effect. Yet, it is unknown how the topological properties
are affected by magnon damping. We report the thermal Hall effect in
Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, an insulating 2D honeycomb ferromagnet with a large Dirac
magnon gap and significant magnon damping. Interestingly, the thermal Hall
conductivity in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ shows the coexisting phonon and magnon
contributions. Using an empirical two-component model, we successfully estimate
the magnon contribution separate from the phonon part, revealing that the
magnon Hall conductivity was 20 times smaller than the theoretical calculation.
Finally, we suggest that such considerable suppression in the magnon Hall
conductivity is due to the magnon damping effect in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$.

<h3>Morphology and stability of droplets sliding on soft viscoelastic  substrates</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Soft solids such as gels and elastomers can be compliant enough to deform
when a droplet lies on their surface, in particular at the line of contact
between the solid, the liquid and the atmosphere. While axisymmetric contact
line motion has received a lot of attention, much less is known about droplets
moving on soft substrates, a configuration often encountered in applications in
which symmetry may be lost. We investigate here the dynamic properties of
droplets sliding on thick viscoelastic layers. We show that the partition of
energy dissipation between the liquid and the solid sets the shape and velocity
of droplets. When dissipation parts equally between the liquid and the solid,
droplet dynamics are similar to that of droplets on rigid substrates. In the
opposite case, we observe shapes that indicate the presence of contact angle
hysteresis. We compare our observations to a non-linear model of the wetting of
soft solids that we proposed recently. We find the model to be in excellent
agreement with our data, in particular regarding the prediction of the
hysteresis that we show to be only apparent. This work opens fondamental
questions on the connection between the properties of the substrate and the
dynamics, shapes and fragmentation of moving droplets that are relevant to all
applications where soft gel coatings may be used.

<h3>Emergence of flat bands via orbital-selective electron correlations in  Mn-based kagome metal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Kagome lattice has been actively studied for the possible realization of
frustration-induced two-dimensional flat bands and a number of
correlation-induced phases. Currently, the search for kagome systems with a
nearly dispersionless flat band close to the Fermi level is ongoing. Here, by
combining theoretical and experimental tools, we present
Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ as a novel realization of correlation-induced
almost-flat bands in the kagome lattice in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Our
magnetic susceptibility, $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance, transport, and
optical conductivity measurements provide signatures of a correlated metallic
phase with tantalizing ferromagnetic instability. Our dynamical mean-field
calculations suggest that such ferromagnetic instability observed originates
from the formation of nearly flat dispersions close to the Fermi level, where
electron correlations induce strong orbital-selective renormalization and
manifestation of the kagome-frustrated bands. In addition, a significant
negative magnetoresistance signal is observed, which can be attributed to the
suppression of flat-band-induced ferromagnetic fluctuation, which further
supports the formation of flat bands in this compound. These findings broaden a
new prospect to harness correlated topological phases via multiorbital
correlations in 3$d$-based kagome systems.

<h3>Trade-offs between number fluctuations and response in nonequilibrium  chemical reaction networks</h3>

<br>

We study the response of chemical reaction networks driven far from
equilibrium to logarithmic perturbations of reaction rates. The response of the
mean number of a chemical species is observed to be quantitively limited by
number fluctuations as well as the maximum thermodynamic driving force. We
prove these trade-offs for linear chemical reaction networks and a class of
nonlinear chemical reaction networks with a single chemical species. Numerical
results for several model systems support the conclusion that these trade-offs
continue to hold for a broad class of chemical reaction networks, though their
precise form appears to depend sensitively on the deficiency of the network.

<h3>Deep learning of experimental electrochemistry for battery cathodes  across diverse compositions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in the discovery
and optimization of novel battery materials. However, the adoption of AI in
battery cathode representation and discovery is still limited due to the
complexity of optimizing multiple performance properties and the scarcity of
high-fidelity data. In this study, we present a comprehensive machine-learning
model (DRXNet) for battery informatics and demonstrate the application in
discovery and optimization of disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. We
have compiled the electrochemistry data of DRX cathodes over the past five
years, resulting in a dataset of more than 30,000 discharge voltage profiles
with 14 different metal species. Learning from this extensive dataset, our
DRXNet model can automatically capture critical features in the cycling curves
of DRX cathodes under various conditions. Illustratively, the model gives
rational predictions of the discharge capacity for diverse compositions in the
Li--Mn--O--F chemical space and high-entropy systems. As a universal model
trained on diverse chemistries, our approach offers a data-driven solution to
facilitate the rapid identification of novel cathode materials, accelerating
the development of next-generation batteries for carbon neutralization.

Exciton excited states in the quantum well are studied via their effect on
the nonradiative broadening of the ground exciton resonance. Dependence of the
nonradiative broadening of the ground exciton state on the photon energy of
additional laser excitation was measured. Applying magnetic field up to 6 T, we
could trace the formation of Landau levels and evolution of the exciton states
of size quantization in a 14-nm GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. Sensitivity of the
technique allowed for observation of the second exciton state of size
quantization, unavailable for conventional reflectance and photoluminescence
spectroscopy. Our interpretation is supported by the numerical calculation of
the exciton energies of the heavy-hole and light-hole subsystems. The numerical
problems were solved using the finite-difference method on the nonuniform grid.
The ground Landau level of the free electron-hole pair was observed and
numerically analysed. In addition to energies of the excited states, electron
hole distances and exciton-light interaction constant was investigated using
the obtained in the numerical procedure exciton wave functions.

A combined study employing density functional theory (DFT) using the
experimentally determined modulated structures and bulk-sensitive hard x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy on single-crystalline Ni$_2$MnGa is presented in
this work. For the aforementioned modulated structures, all of the
characteristic features in the experimental valence band (VB) are in excellent
agreement with the theoretical VB calculated from DFT, evincing that it is the
true representation of Ni$_2$MnGa in the martensite phase. We establish the
existence of a charge density wave (CDW) state in the martensite phase from the
shape of the VB near $E_F$ that shows a transfer of spectral weight in
excellent agreement with DFT. Furthermore, presence of a pseudogap is
established by fitting the near $E_F$ region with a power law function
predicted theoretically for the CDW phase. Thus, the present work emphasizes
that the atomic modulation plays an important role in hosting the CDW phase in
bulk stoichiometric Ni$_2$MnGa.

Superconductors are influenced by high-entropy alloys (HEAs); these have been
investigated in various functional materials. REOBiS$_2$ (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd,
Sm, and Gd in different combinations) single crystals with HEAs at the RE-site
were successfully grown using the flux method. The obtained crystals were
plate-shaped (1 mm$^2$) with a well-developed c-plane. Ce was present in both
trivalent (Ce$^{3+}$) and tetravalent (Ce$^{4+}$) electronic configurations;
the concentration of Ce$^{4+}$ at the RE-site was approximately 10 at% in all
single crystals. The single crystals showed superconducting transition
temperature with zero resistivity within 1.2-4.2 K. The superconducting
transition temperature, superconducting anisotropy, electronic specific heat
coefficient, and Debye temperature of the crystals were not correlated with the
mixed entropy at the RE-site. Except for the electronic specific heat
coefficient, the variation of these parameters as a function of mixed entropy
showed different trends for equivalent and non-equivalent RE element
compositions. Thus, the configuration of RE elements influences the
superconducting properties of REOBiS$_2$ single crystals, alluding to a method
of modulating transition temperatures.

The kinetics of domain growth and aging in conserved order parameter systems,
in the presence of short-range interaction, is widely studied. Due to technical
difficulties and lack of resources, regarding computation, the dynamics is
still not well established in the cases where long-range interactions are
involved. Here we present related results from the Monte Carlo simulations of
the two-dimensional long-range Ising model (LRIM). Random initial
configurations, for $50:50$ compositions of up and down spins, mimicking high
temperature equilibrium states, have been quenched to temperatures inside the
coexistence curve. Our analysis of the simulation data, for such a protocol,
shows interesting dependence of the aging exponent, $\lambda$, on $\sigma$, the
parameter, within the Hamiltonian, that controls the range of interaction. To
complement these results, we also discuss simulation outcomes for the growth
exponent. The obtained values of $\lambda$ are compared with a well-known
result for the lower bounds. For this purpose we have extracted interesting
properties of the evolving structure.

The iron-based superconductor FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ (FST) has recently gained
significant attention as a host of two distinct physical phenomena:
(\textit{i}) Majorana zero modes which can serve as potential topologically
protected qubits, and (\textit{ii}) a realization of the orbital selective Mott
transition (OSMT). In this Letter, we connect these two phenomena and provide
new insights into the interplay between strong electronic correlations and
non-trivial topology in FST. Using linearized quasiparticle self-consistent GW
plus dynamical mean-field theory, we show that the topologically protected
Dirac surface state has substantial Fe($d_{xy}$) character. The proximity to
the OSMT plays a dual role, it facilitates the appearance of the topological
surface state by bringing the Dirac cone close to the chemical potential, but
destroys the Z$_{2}$ topological superconductivity when the system is too close
to the orbital selective Mott phase (OSMP). We derive a reduced effective
Hamiltonian that describes the topological band. Its parameters capture all the
chemical trends found in the first principles calculation. Our findings provide
a framework for further study of the interplay between strong electronic
correlations and non-trivial topology in other iron-based superconductors.

<h3>Quadrature skyrmions in two-dimensionally arrayed parametric resonators</h3>

Skyrmions are topological solitons in two-dimensional systems and have been
observed in various physical systems. Generating and controlling skyrmions in
artificial resonator arrays lead to novel acoustic, photonic, and electric
devices, but it is a challenge to implement a vector variable with the chiral
exchange interaction. Here, we propose to use quadrature variables, where their
parametric coupling enables skyrmions to be stabilized. A finite-element
simulation indicates that a stable acoustic skyrmion would exist in a realistic
structure consisting of a piezoelectric membrane array.

<h3>Excitation and voltage-gated modulation of single-mode dynamics in a  planar nano-gap spin Hall nano-oscillator</h3>

We experimentally study the dynamical modes excited by current-induced
spin-orbit torque and its electrostatic gating effect in a 3-terminal planar
nano-gap spin Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) with a moderate interfacial
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (IPMA). Both quasilinear propagating
spin-wave and localized "bullet" modes are achieved and controlled by varying
the applied in-plane magnetic field and driving current. The minimum linewidth
shows a linear dependence on the actual temperature of the active area,
confirming single-mode dynamics based on the nonlinear theory of spin-torque
nano-oscillation with a single mode. The observed electrostatic gating tuning
oscillation frequency arises from voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy and
threshold current of SHNO via modification of the nonlinear damping and/or the
interfacial spin-orbit coupling of the magnetic multilayer. In contrast to
previously observed two-mode coexistence degrading the spectral purity in
Py/Pt-based SHNOs with a negligible IPMA, a single coherent spin-wave mode with
a low driven current can be achieved by selecting the ferromagnet layer with a
suitable IPMA because the nonlinear mode coupling can be diminished by bringing
in the PMA field to compensate the easy-plane shape anisotropy. Moreover, the
simulations demonstrate that the experimentally observed current and
gate-voltage modulation of auto-oscillation modes are also closely associated
with the nonlinear damping and mode coupling, which are determined by the
ellipticity of magnetization precession. The demonstrated nonlinear mode
coupling mechanism and electrical control approach of spin-wave modes could
provide the clue to facilitate the implementation of the mutual synchronization
map for neuromorphic computing applications in SHNO array networks.

Interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) in 2H-NbSe2
single crystals irradiated by 3 MeV protons is studied. Both Tc and TCDW are
found to decrease monotonically with the increase in irradiation dose. This
behavior is different from electron-irradiated NbSe2, where TCDW is suppressed
monotonically with the increase in dose, while Tc shows an initial enhancement
before it starts to decrease. We attempt to explain this difference based on
the negative pressure effect which has been reported in our previous study on
NbSe2 irradiated by heavy ions.

<br>
<br>
(TaSe$_4$)$_3$I, a compound belonging to the family of quasi-one-dimensional
transition-metal tetrachalcogenides, has drawn significant attention due to a
recent report on possible coexistence of two antagonistic phenomena,
superconductivity and magnetism below 2.5~K (Bera et. al, arXiv:2111.14525).
Here, we report a structural phase transition of the trimerized phase at
temperature, $T~\simeq$~145~K using Raman scattering, specific heat, and
electrical transport measurements. The temperature-dependent single-crystal
X-ray diffraction experiments establish the phase transition from a
high-temperature centrosymmetric to a low-temperature non-centrosymmetric
structure, belonging to the same tetragonal crystal family. The first-principle
calculation finds the aforementioned inversion symmetry-breaking structural
transition to be driven by the hybridization energy gain due to the off-centric
movement of the Ta atoms, which wins over the elastic energy loss.

When interactions between particles are strong, at low temperature, these
particles can form self-organized quantum crystals, and when the particles
interact weakly, periodic structures can be imposed by external fields, e.g. by
optical lattices. These opposite cases usually are treated separately, dealing
either with quantum crystals or with optical lattices. Here the unified theory
is developed for arbitrary particle interaction strength, treating in the frame
of the same model both the limiting cases of quantum crystals and optical
lattices, as well as the states intermediate between these two limits. Bose
particles are considered, hence at low temperature in optical lattices
Bose-Einstein condensation can happen, while it seems to be prohibited in ideal
quantum crystals that do not contain mesoscopic regions of disorder, such as
dislocations and grain boundaries.

The remarkable Cooper-like pairing phenomenon in the Aharonov-Bohm
interference of a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)$\rm{-}$operating in the
integer quantum Hall regime$\rm{-}$remains baffling. Here, we report the
interference of paired electrons employing 'interface edge modes'. These modes
are born at the interface between the bulk of the FPI and an outer gated region
tuned to a lower filling factor. Such configuration allows toggling the spin
and the orbital of the Landau level (LL) of the edge modes at the interface. We
find that electron pairing occurs only when the two modes (the interfering
outer and the first inner) belong to the same spinless LL.

This article investigates the physical and statistical properties of
two-dimensional structures obtained with a dimer packing model, which may be of
great interest in other scientific and technological areas besides theoretical
physics. The study is based on extensive computer simulations in order to
examine the effect of the orientational anisotropy of dimers deposited
following a ballistic deposition process, leading to multilayer networks of
complex morphologies dominated by branched fractal architectures. The geometric
characteristics of the bulk and contours of these systems, and the transport
properties, particularly the electrical conductivity were investigated by
varying the orientational anisotropy of the dimers. The results provide
information about the fundamental mechanisms underlying formation and behavior
of such types of amorphous and disordered matter that are of paramount
importance both to physics as well as to environmental and material sciences.

<h3>Anticorrelated Photoluminescence and Free Charge Generation Proves  Field-Assisted Exciton Dissociation in Low-Offset PM6:Y5 Organic Solar Cells</h3>

Understanding the origin of inefficient photocurrent generation in organic
solar cells with low energy offset remains key to realizing high performance
donor-acceptor systems. Here, we probe the origin of field-dependent free
charge generation and photoluminescence in non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) based
organic solar cells using the polymer PM6 and NFA Y5 - a non-halogenated
sibling to Y6, with a smaller energetic offset to PM6. By performing
time-delayed collection field (TDCF) measurements on a variety of samples with
different electron transport layers and active layer thickness, we show that
the fill factor and photocurrent are limited by field-dependent free charge
generation in the bulk of the blend. We also introduce a new method of TDCF
called m-TDCF to prove the absence of artefacts from non-geminate recombination
of photogenerated- and dark charge carriers near the electrodes. We then
correlate free charge generation with steady state photoluminescence intensity,
and find perfect anticorrelation between these two properties. Through this, we
conclude that photocurrent generation in this low offset system is entirely
controlled by the field dependent exciton dissociation into charge transfer
states.

<h3>Band nonlinearity-enabled manipulation of Dirac nodes, Weyl cones, and  valleytronics with intense linearly polarized light</h3>

We study monochromatic linearly-polarized laser-induced band structure
modifications in material systems with valley (graphene and
hexagonal-Boron-Nitride), and topological (Dirac and Weyl semimetals),
properties. We find that for Dirac-like linearly-dispersing bands, the laser
dressing effectively moves the Dirac nodes away from their original position by
up to ~10% of the Brillouin zone (opening a large pseudo-gap in their original
position). The direction of the movement can be fully controlled by rotating
the laser polarization axis. We prove that this effect originates from band
nonlinearities away from the Dirac nodes (without which the effect completely
vanishes, and which are often neglected). We demonstrate that this physical
mechanism is applicable beyond two-dimensional Dirac semimetals, and can move
the positions of the valley minima in hexagonal materials to tune valley
selectivity, split and move Weyl cones in higher-order Weyl semimetals, and
merge Dirac nodes in three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals. The model
results are validated with ab-initio time-dependent density functional theory
calculations. Our results directly affect theoretical and experimental efforts
for exploring light-dressed electronic-structure, suggesting that one can
benefit from band nonlinearity for tailoring material properties. They also
highlight the importance of describing the full band structure in nonlinear
optical phenomena in solids.

<h3>First-passage functionals for Ornstein Uhlenbeck process with stochastic  resetting</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the statistical properties of first-passage Brownian functionals
(FPBFs) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process in the presence of stochastic
resetting. We consider a one dimensional set-up where the diffusing particle
sets off from $x_0$ and resets to $x_R$ at a certain rate $r$. The particle
diffuses in a harmonic potential (with strength $k$) which is centered around
the origin. The center also serves as an absorbing boundary for the particle
and we denote the first passage time of the particle to the center as $t_f$. In
this set-up, we investigate the following functionals: (i) local time $T_{loc}
= \int _0^{t_f}d \tau ~ \delta (x-x_R)$ i.e., the time a particle spends around
$x_R$ until the first passage, (ii) occupation or residence time $T_{res} =
\int _0^{t_f} d \tau ~\theta (x-x_R)$ i.e., the time a particle typically
spends above $x_R$ until the first passage and (iii) the first passage time
$t_f$ to the origin. We employ the Feynman-Kac formalism for renewal process to
derive the analytical expression for the first moment of all the three FPBFs
mentioned above. In particular, we find that resetting can either prolong or
shorten the mean residence and first passage time depending on the system
parameters. The transition between these two behaviors or phases can be
characterized precisely in terms of optimal resetting rates, which
interestingly undergo a continuous transition as we vary the trap stiffness
$k$. We characterize this transition and identify the critical -parameter \&
-coefficient for both the cases. We also showcase other interesting interplay
between the resetting rate and potential strength on the statistics of these
observables. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with the
numerical simulations.

Material deformation and failure under impact loading is a subject of active
investigation in space science and often requires very specialized equipment
for testing. In this work, we present the design, operational analysis and
application of a low-velocity ($\sim 100$ m/s) projectile impact framework for
evaluating the deformation and failure of space-grade materials. The system is
designed to be modular and easily adaptable to various test geometries, while
enabling accurate quantitative evaluation of plastic flow. Using coupled
numerical methods and experimental techniques, we first establish an operating
procedure for the system. Following this, its performance in two complementary
impact configurations is demonstrated using numerical and experimental
analysis. In the first, a Taylor impact test is performed for predicting the
deformed shape of a cylindrical projectile impinging on a rigid substrate. In
the second, deformation of a plate struck by a rigid projectile is evaluated.
In both cases, physics-based models are used to interpret the resulting fields.
We present a discussion of how the system may be used both for material
property estimation (e.g., dynamic yield strength) as well as for failure
evaluation (e.g., perforation and fracture) in the same projectile impact
configuration.

The magnetic correlations at the superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces
play a crucial role in realizing dissipation-less spin-based logic and memory
technologies, such as triplet-supercurrent spin-valves and "{\pi}" Josephson
junctions. Here we report the coexistence of an induced large magnetic moment
and a crypto ferromagnetic state at high-quality nitride S/F interfaces. Using
polarized neutron reflectometry and d. c. SQUID measurements, we quantitatively
determined the magnetization profile of S/F bilayer and confirmed the induced
magnetic moment in the adjacent superconductor only exists below TC.
Interestingly, the direction of the induced moment in the superconductors was
unexpectedly parallel to that in the ferromagnet, which contrasts with earlier
findings in S/F heterostructures based on metals or oxides. The
first-principles calculations verify the observed unusual interfacial spin
texture is caused by the Heisenberg direct exchange coupling through d orbital
overlapping and severe charge transfer across the interfaces. Our work
establishes an incisive experimental probe for understanding the magnetic
proximity behavior at S/F interfaces and provides a prototype epitaxial
building block for superconducting spintronics.

Circuits provide ideal platforms of topological phases and matter, yet the
study of topological circuits in the strongly nonlinear regime, has been
lacking. We propose and experimentally demonstrate strongly nonlinear
topological phases and transitions in one-dimensional electrical circuits
composed of nonlinear capacitors. Nonlinear topological interface modes arise
on domain walls of the circuit lattices, whose topological phases are
controlled by the amplitudes of nonlinear voltage waves. Experimentally
measured topological transition amplitudes are in good agreement with those
derived from nonlinear topological band theory. Our prototype paves the way
towards flexible metamaterials with amplitude-controlled rich topological
phases and is readily extendable to two and three-dimensional systems that
allow novel applications.

Superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT), a
first-principles approach based on the inhomogeneous two-body correlation
functions, is employed to investigate the response of interacting Brownian
particles to time-dependent external driving. Predictions for the
superadiabatic dynamics of the one-body density are made directly from the
underlying interparticle interactions, without need for either adjustable fit
parameters or simulation input. The external potentials we investigate have
been chosen to probe distinct aspects of structural relaxation in dense,
strongly interacting liquid states. Nonequilibrium density profiles predicted
by the superadiabatic theory are compared with those obtained from both
adiabatic DDFT and event-driven Brownian dynamics simulation. Our findings show
that superadiabatic-DDFT accurately predicts the time-evolution of the one-body
density.

Trapped ions provide a platform for quantum technologies that offers long
coherence times and high degrees of scalability and controllability. Here, we
use this platform to develop a realistic model of a thermal device consisting
of two laser-driven, strongly coupled Rydberg ions in a harmonic trap. We show
that the translational degrees of freedom of this system can be utilized as a
flywheel storing the work output that is generated by a cyclic thermodynamic
process applied to its electronic degrees of freedom. Mimicking such a process
through periodic variations of external control parameters, we use a mean-field
approach underpinned by exact numerical and analytical calculations to identify
relevant physical processes and to determine the charging rate of the flywheel.
Our work paves the way for the design of microscopic thermal machines based on
Rydberg ions that can be equipped with both many-body working media and
universal work storages.

Topological superconductors are foreseen as good candidates for the search of
Majorana zero modes, where they appear as edge states and can be used for
quantum computation. In this context, it becomes necessary to study the
robustness and behavior of electron states in topological superconductors when
a magnetic or non-magnetic impurity is present. We focus on scattering
resonances in the bands and on spin texture to know what the spin behavior of
the electrons in the system will be. We find that the scattering resonances
appear outside the superconducting gap, thus providing evidence of topological
robustness. We also find non-trivial and anisotropic spin textures related to
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The spin textures show a
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction governed by Friedel oscillations. We
believe that our results are useful for further studies which consider
many-point-impurity scattering or a more structured impurity potential with a
finite range.

Harnessing spin and orbital angular momentum is a fundamental concept in
condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum-device applications.
In particular, the search for new phenomena that generate a flow of spin
angular momentum, a spin current, has led to the development of spintronics,
advancing the understanding of angular momentum dynamics at the nanoscale. In
contrast to this success, the generation and detection of orbital currents, the
orbital counterpart of spin currents, remains a significant challenge. Here, we
report the observation of orbital pumping, a phenomenon in which magnetization
dynamics pumps an orbital current, a flow of orbital angular momentum. The
orbital pumping is the orbital counterpart of the spin pumping, which is one of
the most versatile and powerful mechanisms for spin-current generation. We show
that the orbital pumping in Ni/Ti bilayers injects an orbital current into the
Ti layer, which is detected through the inverse orbital Hall effect. Our
findings provide a promising approach for generating orbital currents and pave
the way for exploring the physics of orbital transport in solids.

diverse and well-mixed ecosystems. We analyze the multiple equilibria phase of
the model and compute its quenched complexity, i.e., the expected value of the
logarithm of the number of equilibria of the dynamical equations. We discuss
the resulting distribution of equilibria as a function of their diversity,
stability and average abundance. We obtain the quenched complexity by means of
the replicated Kac-Rice formalism, and compare the results with the same
quantity obtained within the annealed approximation, as well as with the
results of the cavity calculation and, in the limit of symmetric interactions,
of standard methods to compute the complexity developed in the context of
glasses.

Efficient generation and manipulation of spin signals in a given material
without invoking external magnetism remain one of the challenges in
spintronics. The spin Hall effect (SHE) and Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) are
well-known mechanisms to electrically generate spin accumulation in materials
with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), but the exact role of the strength and
type of SOC, especially in crystals with low symmetry, has yet to be explained.
In this study, we investigate REE in two different families of non-magnetic
chiral materials, elemental semiconductors (Te and Se) and semimetallic
disilicides (TaSi$_2$ and NbSi$_2$), using an approach based on density
functional theory (DFT). By analyzing spin textures across the full Brillouin
zones and comparing them with REE magnitudes calculated as a function of
chemical potential, we link specific features in the electronic structure with
the efficiency of the induced spin accumulation. Our findings show that
magnitudes of REE can be increased by: (i) the presence of purely radial
(Weyl-type) spin texture manifesting as the parallel spin-momentum locking,
(ii) high spin polarization of bands along one specific crystallographic
direction, (iii) low band velocities. By comparing materials possessing the
same crystal structures, but different strengths of SOC, we conclude that
larger SOC may indirectly contribute to the enhancement of REE. It yields
greater spin-splitting of bands along specific crystallographic directions,
which prevents canceling the contributions from the oppositely spin-polarized
bands over wider energy regions and helps maintain larger REE magnitudes. We
believe that these results will be useful for designing spintronics devices and
may aid further computational studies searching for efficient REE in materials
with different symmetries and SOC strengths.

Self-propulsion of catalytic Janus swimmers in electrolyte solutions is
induced by inhomogeneous ion release from their surface. Here, we consider the
experimentally relevant cases of particles which emit only one type of ions
(type I) or equal fluxes of cations and anions (type II). In the limit of a
thin electrostatic diffuse layer we derive a nonlinear outer solution for the
electric field and concentrations of active (i.e. released from the surface)
and passive ionic species. We show that for swimmers of type I both the maximum
ion flux and propulsion velocity are constrained. This suggests that the
propulsion of Janus swimmers can be optimized by tuning the concentration of
active ions.

As a recent successfully exfoliated non van der Waals layered material,
AgCrS2 has received a lot of attentions. Motivated by its structure related
magnetic and ferroelectric behavior, a theoretical study on its exfoliated
monolayer AgCr2S4 has been carried out in the present work. Based on density
functional theory, the ground state and magnetic order of monolayer AgCr2S4
have been determined. The centrosymmetry emerges upon two-dimensional
confinement and thus eliminates the bulk polarity. Moreover, two-dimensional
ferromagnetism appears in the CrS2 layer of AgCr2S4 and can persist up to room
temperature. The surface adsorption has also been taken into consideration,
which shows a nonmonotonic effect on the ionic conductivity through ion
displacement of the interlayer Ag, but has little impact on the layered
magnetic structure.

<h3>Micromagnetics and Multiscale Hysteresis Simulations of Permanent  Magnets</h3>

Confronting the unveiled sophisticated multiscale structural and physical
characteristics of hysteresis simulation of permanent magnets, notably
samarium-cobalt (Sm-Co) alloy, a novel scheme is proposed linking physics-based
micromagnetics on the nanostructure level and magnetostatic homogenization on
the mesoscale polycrystal level. Thereby the micromagnetics-informed surrogate
hysteron is the key to bridge the scales of nanostructure and polycrystal
structure. This hysteron can readily emulate the local magnetization reversal
with the nanoscale mechanisms considered, such as nucleation of domains, and
domain wall migration and pinning. The overall hysteresis, based on a sintered
Sm-Co polycrystal, considering both mesoscale and nanoscale characteristics, is
simulated and discussed.

<h3>Spin crossover transition driven by pressure: Barocaloric applications</h3>

This article describes a mean-field theoretical model for Spin-Crossover
(SCO) materials and explores its implications. It is based on a simple
Hamiltonian that yields the high spin molar fraction as a function of
temperature and pressure, as well as a temperature-pressure phase diagram for
the SCO transition. In order to test the model, we apply it to the giant
Barocaloric Effect (BCE) of the SCO material [FeL$_2$][BF$_4$]$_2$ and
comprehensively analyse its behavior. We found that optical phonons are
responsible for 92\% of the total barocaloric entropy change. DFT calculations
show that these optical phonons are mainly assigned to the low frequencies
modes of vibration ($<400$ cm$^{-1}$), being associated to the Fe coordination.

For a parameterized family of invertible states (short-range-entangled
states) in $(1+1)$ dimensions, we discuss a generalization of the Berry phase.
Using translationally-invariant, infinite matrix product states (MPSs), we
introduce a gerbe structure, a higher generalization of complex line bundles,
as an underlying mathematical structure describing topological properties of a
parameterized family of matrix product states. We also introduce a "triple
inner product" for three matrix product states, which allows us to extract a
topological invariant, the Dixmier-Douady class over the parameter space.

<h3>Transient translation symmetry breaking via quartic-order negative  light-phononcoupling at Brillouin zone boundary in KTaO${}_{3}$</h3>

KTaO${}_{3}$ presents a rich hyper-Raman spectrum originating from two-phonon
processes at the Brillouin zone boundary, indicating the possibility of driving
these phonon modes using intense midinfrared laser sources. We obtained the
coupling of light to the highest-frequency longitudinal optic phonon mode
$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ at the $X$ $(0,0, \frac{1}{2})$ point by first principles
calculations of the total energy as a function of the phonon coordinate
$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ and electric field $E$. We find that the energy curve as a
function of $Q_{\rm{HY}}$ softens for finite values of electric field,
indicating the presence of $Q_{\rm{HY}}^2 E^2$ nonlinearity with negative
coupling coefficient. We studied the feasibility of utilizing this nonlinearity
to transiently break the translation symmetry of the material by making the
$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ mode unstable with an intense midinfrared pump pulse. We also
considered the possibility that nonlinear phonon-phonon couplings can excite
the lowest-frequency phonon coordinates $Q_{\rm{LZ}}$ and $Q_{\rm{LX}}$ at $X$
when the $Q_{\rm{HY}}$ mode is externally driven. The nonlinear phonon-phonon
couplings were also obtained from first principles via total-energy
calculations as a function of the phonon coordinates, and these were used to
construct the coupled classical equations of motion for the phonon coordinates
in the presence of an external pump term on $Q_{\rm{HY}}$. We numerically
solved them for a range of pump frequencies and amplitudes and found three
regimes where the translation symmetry is broken: i) rectification of the
lowest-frequency coordinates due to large amplitude oscillation of the
$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ coordinate about its equilibrium position, ii) rectification of
only the $Q_{\rm{HY}}$ coordinate without displaced oscillations of the
lowest-frequency coordinates, and iii) rectification of all three coordinates.

Ni-Mn-based Heusler alloys like Ni-Mn-Sn show an elastocaloric as well as
magnetocaloric effect during the magneto-structural phase transition, making
this material interesting for solid-state cooling application. Material
processing by additive manufacturing can overcome difficulties related to
machinability of the alloys, caused by their intrinsic brittleness. Since the
magnetic properties and transition temperature are highly sensitive to the
chemical composition, it is essential to understand and monitoring these
properties over the entire processing chain. In the present work the
microstructural and magnetic properties from gas-atomized powder to
post-processed Ni-Mn-Sn alloy are investigated. Direct energy deposition was
used for processing, promoting the evolution of a polycrystalline
microstructure being characterized by elongated grains along the building
direction. A complete and sharp martensitic transformation can be achieved
after applying a subsequent heat treatment at 1173 K for 24 h. The
Mn-evaporation of 1.3 at. % and the formation of Mn-oxide during DED-processing
lead to an increase of the transition temperature of 45 K and a decrease of
magnetization, clearly pointing at the necessity of controlling the
composition, oxygen partial pressure and magnetic properties over the entire
processing chain.
