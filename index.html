<h3>Self-organisation of auto-phoretic suspensions in confined shear flows</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09178</a>

<i>Prathmesh Vinze, Sebastien Michelin</i>
<p>Janus phoretic particles exploit chemical energy stored in their environment
to self-propel. These active particles modify and respond to their hydrodynamic
and chemical environments, thus giving them a sensibility to external flows and
other particles. Furthermore, experimental observations and analysis on
biological or synthetic active suspensions indicate that hydro-chemical
interparticle interactions lead to non-trivial collective behaviour (e.g.,
cluster formation of phoretic particles or bacterial swarming) and that the
response of the suspensions to shear flows is non-trivial. In fact, it can lead
to significant reductions in viscosity due to the energy conversion at
microscopic scales. In this work, using simulations of a continuum kinetic
model, we analyse the dynamics and response to shear and confinement of dilute
suspensions of chemotactic phoretic particles that reorient and drift toward
the chemical solutes released by their neighbours. We show that a 1D transient
steady distribution driven by the effect of confinement is a common feature
considered and analyse its stability for varying confinement strength and shear
rate. In the second step, we consider and discuss, more specifically, the
feedback effect on the flow by the particle and the resulting effective
viscosity of the suspension.

<p>We investigate the effect of non-zero temperature to the condensate fraction
of a homogeneous dilute weakly interacting Bose gas in very low-temperature
region. Within inproved Hartree-Fock approximation, the
Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action approach shows that the thermal
fluctuations make the condensate fraction decrease as a second and fourth-order
power law of temperature. The result is compared with experimental data.
Indeed, the effect of non-infinite size of the trap is also integrated.

<h3>Defect-sensitive High-frequency Modes in a Three-Dimensional Artificial  Magnetic Crystal</h3>

<p>Modern three-dimensional nanofabrication methods make it possible to generate
arbitrarily shaped nanomagnets, including periodic networks of interconnected
magnetic nanowires. Structurally similar to optical or acoustic metamaterials,
these arrays could represent magnetic variants of such artificial materials.
Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate a three-dimensional array of
interconnected magnetic nanowires with intersection points corresponding to
atomic positions of a diamond lattice. The high-frequency excitation spectrum
of this artificial magnetic crystal (AMC) is governed by its microstructure
and, to a lesser extent, by the magnetic configuration. The magnetic system
displays characteristics of three-dimensional artificial spin ice. It can
contain Dirac-type magnetic defect structures, which modify the magnonic
spectrum of the AMC similarly as defect sites in a natural diamond crystal
influence optical absorption spectra. Our study opens new perspectives for
applying such materials in high-density magnonic devices and shows that AMCs
represent a promising category of magnonic materials with tunable properties.

<h3>Topological fine structure of an energy band</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08436" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08436</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Liu, Cosma Fulga, Emil J. Bergholtz, Janos Asboth</i>
<p>A band with a nonzero Chern number cannot be fully localized by weak
disorder. There must remain at least one extended state, which ``carries the
Chern number.'' Here we show that a trivial band can behave in a similar way.
Instead of fully localizing, arbitrarily weak disorder leads to the emergence
of two sets of extended states, positioned at two different energy intervals,
which carry opposite Chern numbers. Thus, a single trivial band can show the
same behavior as two separate Chern bands. We show that this property is
predicted by a topological invariant called a ``localizer index.'' Even though
the band as a whole is trivial as far as the Chern number is concerned, the
localizer index allows access to a topological fine structure. This index
changes as a function of energy within the bandwidth of the trivial band,
causing nontrivial extended states to appear as soon as disorder is introduced.
Our work points to a previously overlooked manifestation of topology, which
impacts the response of systems to impurities beyond the information included
in conventional topological invariants.

<h3>Majorana modes in striped two-dimensional inhomogeneous topological  superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Pasquale Marra, Daisuke Inotani, Takeshi Mizushima, Muneto Nitta</i>
<p>Majorana zero modes have gained significant interest due to their potential
applications in topological quantum computing and in the realization of exotic
quantum phases. These zero-energy quasiparticle excitations localize at the
vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors or at the ends of
one-dimensional topological superconductors. Here we describe an alternative
platform: a two-dimensional topological superconductor with inhomogeneous
superconductivity, where Majorana modes localize at the ends of topologically
nontrivial one-dimensional stripes induced by the spatial variations of the
order parameter phase. In certain regimes, these Majorana modes hybridize into
a single highly nonlocal state delocalized over spatially separated points,
with exactly zero energy at finite system sizes and with emergent
quantum-mechanical supersymmetry. We then present detailed descriptions of
braiding and fusion protocols and showcase the versatility of our proposal by
suggesting possible setups which can potentially lead to the realization
Yang-Lee anyons and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

<h3>Computational design of NDR tunnel diodes with high peak-to-valley  current ratio based on two-dimensional cold metals: The case of  NbSi$_2$N$_4$/HfSi$_2$N$_4$/NbSi$_2$N$_4$ lateral heterojunction diode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08473" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08473</a>
<br>
<i>P. Bodewei, E. Şaşıoğlu, N. F. Hinsche, I. Mertig</i>
<p>Cold metals have recently gained attention as a promising platform for
innovative devices, such as tunnel diodes with negative differential resistance
(NDR) and field-effect transistors with subthreshold swings below the
thermionic limit. Recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Ti,
Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta; A = Si, Ge; Z = N, P) compounds exhibit both cold metallic and
semiconducting behavior. In this work, we present a computational study of
lateral heterojunction tunnel diodes based on 2D NbSi$_2$N$_4$ and
HfSi$_2$N$_4$ compounds. Employing density functional theory combined with a
nonequilibrium Green function method, we investigate the current-voltage
($I$-$V$) characteristics of lateral tunnel diodes with varying barrier
thicknesses in both zigzag and armchair orientations. We find that tunnel
diodes in the zigzag orientation exhibit significantly higher peak current
densities, while those in the armchair orientation display larger
peak-to-valley current ratios (PVCRs) compared to the zigzag orientation. Our
findings suggest that MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials are promising candidates for
realizing NDR tunnel diodes with high PVCR values, which could have potential
applications in memory, logic circuits, and other electronic devices.

<h3>Emergent Fermion Dynamical Symmetry for Monolayer Graphene in a Strong  Magnetic Field</h3>

<br>
<i>Mike Guidry, Lianao Wu, Fletcher Williams</i>
<p>We review the physics of monolayer graphene in a strong magnetic field, with
emphasis on highly collective states that emerge from the weakly interacting
system because of correlations (emergent states). After reviewing the general
properties of graphene and of electrons in a magnetic field, we give a brief
introduction to the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in a 2D electron gas as foundation to show that
monolayer graphene in a magnetic field exhibits both effects, but with
properties modified by the influence of the graphene crystal. After giving an
introduction to standard methods of dealing with emergent states for this
system, we show that an SO(8) fermion dynamical symmetry governs the emergent
degrees of freedom and that the algebraic and group properties of the dynamical
symmetry provide a new view of strongly correlated states observed in monolayer
graphene subject to a strong magnetic field.

<h3>Enhanced Magnetization by Defect-Assisted Exciton Recombination in  Atomically Thin CrCl$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08476" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08476</a>

<p>Two dimensional (2D) semiconductors present unique opportunities to
intertwine optical and magnetic functionalities and to tune these performances
through defects and dopants. In 2D semiconductors, the properties of excitons
often vary due to the underlying magnetic order, but the modification of their
magnetic properties by excitonic processes remains difficult to achieve. Here,
we integrate exciton pumping into a quantum sensing protocol on
nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to image the optically-induced transient
stray fields in few-layer, antiferromagnetic CrCl$_3$. We discover that exciton
recombination enhances the in-plane magnetization of the CrCl$_3$ layers, with
an outsized effect in the surface monolayers and when the surface is
unencapsulated. Concomitantly, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements
reveal that a defect-assisted Auger recombination dominates for atomically thin
CrCl$_3$ with tightly localized, nearly forbidden excitons and amplified
surface-to-volume ratio. These experimental signatures establish the
magnetically enhanced state to result from an exciton-activated electron
transfer between surface impurities and the spin-polarized conduction band.
Density functional theory calculations identify that the mediating impurity
state could originate from oxygen adsorbates with spins antiparallel to the
magnetization of their host layer. Our work unambiguously demonstrates the
tunability of single intrinsic magnetic layers via defect engineering and opens
a pathway to dynamically reconfigure these effects in devices through optical
control.

<h3>Spinel LiGa$_5$O$_8$ prospects as ultra-wideband-gap semiconductor: band  structure, optical properties and doping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08486" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08486</a>
<br>
<i>Waler R. L.Lambrecht</i>
<p>LiGa$_5$O$_8$ in the spinel type structure is investigated as a potential
ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor. The band structure is determined using the
quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ method and the optical properties are
calculated at the Bethe Salpeter Equation level including electron-hole
interaction effects. The optical gap including exciton effects and an estimate
of the zero-point motion electron phonon coupling renormalizations is estimated
to be about 5.2$\pm0.1$ eV with an exciton binding energy of about 0.4 eV. Si
doping as potential n-type dopant is investigated and found to be a promising
shallow donor.

<h3>Electronic properties of two-dimensional rectangular graphyne based on  phenyl-like building blocks</h3>

<br>
<i>Anderson Gomes Vieira, Marcelo Lopes Pereira Júnior, Vincent Meunier, Eduardo Costa Girão</i>
<p>A rectangular graphyne sheet is composed of units similar to phenyl rings
that are linked by acetylenic chains, as in hexagonal $\gamma$-graphyne. This
system is organized over a rectangular lattice similar to that of the recently
synthesized biphenylene network. We investigate the stability of this sheet
from different perspectives and study its electronic structure. Rectangular
graphyne is a semiconducting system in its pristine form and features a pair of
highly localized states. These characteristics are correlated with the
structural anisotropy of the system, since its frontier states behave like
quasi--1D states embedded in the 2D lattice. We further consider modified
systems in which longer acetylenic links are introduced. We discuss how a
strategic choice of the position of these longer bridges can lead to specific
changes of the electronic structure of the rectangular graphyne sheet.

<h3>Inelastic scattering of transversely structured free electrons from  nanophotonic targets: Theory and computation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08513" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08513</a>
<br>
<i>Austin G. Nixon, Matthieu Chalifour, Marc R. Bourgeois, Michael Sanchez, David J. Masiello</i>
<p>Recent advancements in abilities to create and manipulate the electron's
transverse wave function within the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and
scanning TEM (STEM) have enabled vectorially-resolved electron energy loss
(EEL) and gain (EEG) measurements of nanoscale and quantum material responses
using pre- and post-selected free electron states. This newfound capability is
prompting renewed theoretical interest in quantum mechanical treatments of
inelastic electron scattering observables and the information they contain.
Here, we present a quantum mechanical treatment of the inelastic scattering of
free electrons between pre- and post-selected transverse states with
fully-retarded electron-sample interactions for both spontaneous EEL and
continuous-wave laser-stimulated EEG measurements. General expressions for the
state-resolved energy loss and gain rates are recast in forms amenable to
numerical calculation using the method of coupled dipoles. We numerically
implement our theory within the $e$-DDA code, and use it to investigate
specific examples that highlight its versatility regarding the number, size,
geometry, and material composition of the target specimen, as well as its
ability to describe matter-wave diffraction from finite nanoscopic targets.

<h3>Emergence of Disordered Hyperuniformity in Melts of Linear Diblock  Copolymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08541" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08541</a>
<br>
<i>Duyu Chen, Michael A. Klatt, Glenn H. Fredrickson</i>
<p>Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) systems are recently discovered exotic states
of matter, where (normalized) large-scale density fluctuations are completely
suppressed as in crystals, even though the systems are isotropic and lack
conventional long-range order. Despite recent success, realizing such systems
using bottom-up approaches remains challenging. Here, we study the large-scale
behavior of neat melts of linear diblock copolymers using large-cell
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations. We initialize SCFT simulations
using point patterns that correspond to the local energy minimum of the
so-called Quantizer energy, a geometric functional related to the free energy
of copolymeric self-assemblies. Upon relaxation via the SCFT simulations, we
obtain a new class of metastable disordered micelle mesophases that are
hyperuniform. Moreover, we find that DHU micelle mesophases possess very
similar free energies to the thermodynamically stable body-centered cubic
sphere mesophases and are also much more favorable energetically than
previously obtained liquid-like packings. Our findings shed light on the design
of novel disordered hyperuniform materials using bottom-up approaches, and
suggest new possibilities for technological applications, e.g., novel
non-iridescent structural colors.

<h3>Crystalline finite-size topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08552" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08552</a>
<br>
<i>Michał J. Pacholski, Ashley M. Cook</i>
<p>Topological phases stabilized by crystalline point group symmetry protection
are a large class of symmetry-protected topological phases subjected to
considerable experimental scrutiny. Here, we show that the canonical
three-dimensional (3D) crystalline topological insulator protected by
time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$ and four-fold rotation symmetry
$\mathcal{C}_4$ individually or the product symmetry $\mathcal{C}_4
\mathcal{T}$, generically realizes finite-size crystalline topological phases
in thin film geometry (a quasi-(3-1)-dimensional, or q(3-1)D, geometry):
response signatures of the 3D bulk topology co-exist with
topologically-protected, quasi-(3-2)D and quasi-(3-3)D boundary modes within
the energy gap resulting from strong hybridisation of the Dirac cone surface
states of the underlying 3D crystalline topological phase. Importantly, we find
qualitative distinctions between these gapless boundary modes and those of
strictly 2D crystalline topological states with the same symmetry-protection,
and develop a low-energy, analytical theory of the finite-size topological
magnetoelectric response.

<h3>Transport through a monolayer-tube junction: sheet-to-tube spin current  in silicene</h3>

<i>Yuma Kitagawa, Yuta Suzuki, Shin-ichiro Tezuka, Hiroshi Akera</i>
<p>A method is developed to calculate the electron flow between an atomic
monolayer sheet and a tube with use of tunneling matrix elements between
monolayer sheets and applied to the spin current from monolayer silicene with
sublattice-staggered current-induced spin polarization to silicene tube.
Calculated sheet-to-tube spin current exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations as
the Fermi points in the tube cross the Fermi circle in the sheet. It is also
shown that the spin current with spin in the out-of-plane direction, which is
absent in bilayer silicene (including twisted bilayer) with the $C_3$
rotational symmetry, appears in the form of quasi-periodic oscillations owing
to the broken $C_3$ symmetry in the tube-sheet junction.

<h3>Simulations of Thin Polymer Films on Flat and Curved Substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08582" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08582</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriel Catalini, Nicolás A. García, Daniel A. Vega, Arash Nikoubashman</i>
<p>We report molecular dynamics simulation results on the equilibrium properties
of polymer thin films adsorbed onto flat and curved substrates. We first
systematically determine the contact angle of polymer droplets on flat
substrates as a function of the substrate-monomer adsorption strength and
degree of polymerization. Focussing on the fully wetted regime, we then
investigate the effect of the substrate's topography on the polymer film
configuration by using substrates with varying mean curvature. We find that
polymer chains close to the substrate are significantly stretched (compressed)
in regions of high negative (positive) mean curvature. Further, we find partial
dewetting near regions of high mean curvature for thin polymer films. For
thicker films, the polymers fully cover the substrate and the shape of the
liquid-vapor interface largely follows the shape of the substrate. As the film
thickness is increased further, the liquid-vapor interface becomes completely
flat. These simulation results are corroborated by analytic calculations using
a simplified continuum model that treats the adsorbed polymers as an
incompressible medium. Our findings show how the substrate topography
influences the conformation of individual chains as well as the shape of the
entire film.

<h3>Markov-bridge generation of transition paths and its application to  cell-fate choice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08605</a>
<br>
<i>Guillaume Le Treut, Sarah Ancheta, Greg Huber, Henri Orland, David Yllanes</i>
<p>We present a method to sample Markov-chain trajectories constrained to both
the initial and final conditions, which we term Markov bridges. The
trajectories are conditioned to end in a specific state at a given time. We
derive the master equation for Markov bridges, which exhibits the original
transition rates scaled by a time-dependent factor. Trajectories can then be
generated using a refined version of the Gillespie algorithm. We illustrate the
benefits of our method by sampling trajectories in the M\"uller-Brown
potential. This allows us to generate transition paths which would otherwise be
obtained at a high computational cost with standard Kinetic Monte Carlo methods
because commitment to a transition path is essentially a rare event. We then
apply our method to a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mouse pancreatic
cells to investigate the cell differentiation pathways of endocrine-cell
precursors. By sampling Markov bridges for a specific differentiation pathway
we obtain a time-resolved dynamics that can reveal features such as cell types
which behave as bottlenecks. The ensemble of trajectories also gives
information about the fluctuations around the most likely path. For example, we
quantify the statistical weights of different branches in the differentiation
pathway to alpha cells.

<p>Structural relaxations are intrinsic to all liquids and glasses. They are the
fundamental processes underlying many material properties. However, the
mechanism of structural relaxations is still unclear due to the experimental
difficulties in directly characterizing the atomic-scale relaxations. The
latter exhibit a broad range of timescales from geological times to
sub-picoseconds. Here we show that, using split-delay coherent pulses of X-ray
free electron lasers (XFEL), we can achieve the femtosecond temporal and
atomic-scale spatial resolutions of the X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
(fs-XPCS). The latter allows us to directly observe atomic-scale relaxation
dynamics and determine the intermediate scattering function in a high-fluidity
fragile liquid. We find that the beam characteristics of the double pulses from
the split-delay drift over time, the correction of which is essential to obtain
the accurate intermediate scattering functions from speckle contrasts. Our
finding demonstrates a new avenue of direct experimental studies of relaxation
dynamics with the femtosecond resolution, a 12 orders of magnitude extension
from the sub-seconds regime of the synchrotron-based XPCS.

<h3>Proofreading mechanism for colloidal self-assembly</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08619" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08619</a>
<br>
<i>Qian-Ze Zhu, Chrisy Xiyu Du, Ella M. King, Michael P. Brenner</i>
<p>Designing components that can robustly self-assemble into structures with
biological complexity is a grand challenge for material science. Proofreading
and error correction is required to improve assembly yield beyond equilibrium
limits, using energy to avoid kinetic traps in the energy landscape. Here we
introduce an explicit two staged proofreading scheme for patchy particle
colloidal assemblies that substantially improves assembly yield and robustness.
The first stage implements local rules whereby particles increase their binding
strengths when they detect a local environment corresponding to a desired
target. The second stage corrects remaining errors, adding a reverse pathway
inspired by kinetic proofreading. The scheme shows significant yield
improvements, eliminating kinetic traps, giving a much broader temperature
range with high yield. Additionally, the scheme is robust against quenched
disorder in the components. Our findings illuminate a pathway for advancing
programmable design of synthetic living materials, potentially fostering the
synthesis of novel biological materials and functional behaviors.

<h3>Access Single Mode Approximation via Quantum Monte Carlo</h3>

<br>
<i>Yan Liu, Kemeng Wu, Yan-Cheng Wang, Jie Lou, Zheng Yan, Yan Chen</i>
<p>We extend the Single Mode Approximation (SMA) into quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
versions to obtain the dynamical dispersion of quantum many-body systems. Based
on Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) and its projector algorithms, we put
forward the ways to realize the calculation of SMA within the SSE frame. The
SMA + QMC method can quickly extract the dispersion of the dynamical spectrum
without external calculations and high technique barriers. Meanwhile, numerical
analytic continuation methods require the fine data of imaginary time
correlations and complex programming. Therefore, our method can approach the
excitation spectrum of large systems, e.g., we take a $512 \times 512$ spin
model as an example in this work. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our method with high precision via several examples.

<h3>Unlocking High Performance, Ultra-Low Power Van der Waals Transistors:  Towards Back-End-of-Line In-Sensor Machine Vision Applications</h3>

<i>Olaiyan Alolaiyan, Shahad Albwardi, Sarah Alsaggaf, Thamer Tabbakh, Frank W. DelRio, Moh. R. Amer</i>
<p>Recent reports on machine learning (ML) and machine vision (MV) devices have
demonstrated the potentials of 2D materials and devices. Yet, scalable 2D
devices are being challenged by contact resistance and Fermi Level Pinning
(FLP), power consumption, and low-cost CMOS compatible lithography processes.
To enable CMOS+2D, it is essential to find a proper lithography strategy that
can fulfill these requirements. Here, we explore modified van der Waals (vdW)
deposition lithography and demonstrate a relatively new class of
van-der-Waals-Field-Effect-Transistors (vdW-FETs) based on 2D materials. This
lithography strategy enables us to unlock high performance devices evident by
high current on-off ratio (Ion/Ioff), high turn-on current density (Ion), and
weak Fermi Level Pinning (FLP). We utilize this approach to demonstrate a
gate-tunable near-ideal diode using MoS2/WSe2 heterojunction with an ideality
factor of ~1.65 and current rectification of 102. We finally demonstrate a
highly sensitive, scalable, and ultra-low power phototransistor using MoS2/
WSe2 vdW-FET for Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) integration. Our phototransistor
exhibits the highest gate-tunable photoresponsivity achieved to date for white
light detection with ultra-low power dissipation, enabling ultra-sensitive,
ultra-fast, and efficient optoelectronic applications such as in-sensor
neuromorphic machine vision. Our approach shows the great potential of modified
vdW deposition lithography for back-end-of-line CMOS+2D applications.

<h3>Nonlinear optical responses in multi-orbital topological superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08638" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08638</a>
<br>
<i>Arpit Raj, Abigail Postlewaite, Swati Chaudhary, Gregory A. Fiete</i>
<p>We theoretically study first and second-order optical responses in a
transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer with distinct trivial, nodal, and
time-reversal invariant topological superconducting (TRITOPS) phases. We show
that the second-order DC response, also known as the photogalvanic response,
contains signatures for differentiating these phases while the first-order
optical response does not. We find that the high-frequency photogalvanic
response is insensitive to the phase of the system, while the low-frequency
response exhibits features distinguishing the three phases. At zero doping,
corresponding to an electron filling in which the Fermi level lies at nodal
points, there are opposite sign zero-frequency divergences in the response when
approaching the nodal phase boundaries from the trivial and the TRITOPS phases.
In the trivial phase, both the high-frequency and low-frequency response of the
system are negative, but in the TRITOPS phase, the low-frequency response
becomes positive while the high-frequency response remains negative.
Furthermore, since phase transitions are controlled by the Rashba spin-orbit
coupling and the ratio of intra-orbital and inter-orbital paring amplitudes,
our results not only help distinguish the phases but can also provide an
estimate of the pairing amplitudes based on the photogalvanic response of the
system.

microelectronics. However, fundamental atomic-level understanding of their
intrinsic switching mechanisms and domain energetics remains elusive. By
combining scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional
theory, we reveal sub-nanometer electric-field-induced domain walls in a
representative wurtzite ferroelectric, ScGaN. We observe vertical domain walls
with side-by-side antiparallel polarization and, significantly, a new type of
horizontal domain wall featuring a novel "2H MoS2-like" configuration. Such
configuration substantiates a buckled hexagonal phase with large polarization
discontinuity and rich dangling bonds, offering a new framework for domain wall
electronics. Our findings mark a pivotal step in understanding ferroelectric
domain switching in this emerging material class and lay the groundwork for
fundamental physics studies and innovative device applications based on
wurtzite ferroelectrics.

<i>Shun Muroga, Takashi Honda, Yasuaki Miki, Hideaki Nakajima, Don N. Futaba, Kenji Hata</i>
<p>To meet the demands for more adaptable and expedient approaches to augment
both research and manufacturing, we report an autonomous system using real-time
in-situ characterization and an autonomous, decision-making processer based on
an active learning algorithm. This system was applied to a plastic film forming
system to highlight its efficiency and accuracy in determining the process
conditions for specified target film dimensions, importantly, without any human
intervention. Application of this system towards nine distinct film dimensions
demonstrated the system ability to quickly determine the appropriate and stable
process conditions (average 11 characterization-adjustment iterations, 19
minutes) and the ability to avoid traps, such as repetitive over-correction.
Furthermore, comparison of the achieved film dimensions to the target values
showed a high accuracy (R2 = 0.87, 0.90) for film width and thickness,
respectively. In addition, the use of an active learning algorithm afforded our
system to proceed optimization with zero initial training data, which was
unavailable due to the complex relationships between the control factors
(material supply rate, applied force, material viscosity) within the plastic
forming process. As our system is intrinsically general and can be applied to
any most material processes, these results have significant implications in
accelerating both research and industrial processes.

<h3>Confinement of electron holes via the peroxo group formation in the  negative charge-transfer materials on the example of SrFeO3: plane-wave  density functional theory predictions</h3>

<p>The present work puts forward a concept that the thermostable O1s XPS peaks
with energy of about 531 eV in negative charge-transfer SrFeO_{3-\delta}
perovskite are determined by the peroxo-like oxygen species. The peroxo group
forms via coupling two oxygen anions coordinated to iron cations with
d^5\bar-under{L} (\bar-under{L}-oxygen electron hole) configuration. By means
of plane-wave DFT+U approach there have been shown that the peroxo group
represents a metastable state in the absence of oxygen vacancies nearby. The
O-O bonding confines two electron holes freezing the 3+ oxidation state for two
iron cations bridged by peroxide. Increasing the peroxo group numbers makes the
ferrite a semiconductor with charge-transfer gap of about 0.6 eV.

<p>Magnetic topological insulator is a fertile platform to study the interplay
between magnetism and topology. The unique electronic band structure can induce
exotic transport and optical properties. However, a comprehensive optical study
in both near-infrared frequency and terahertz frequency has been lacking. Here,
we report magneto-optical effects from a heterostructure of Cr-incorporated
topological insulator, CBST. We use 800 nm magneto-optical Kerr effect to
reveal a ferromagnetic order in the CBST film with a high transition
temperature at 160 K. We also use time-domain terahertz polarimetry to reveal a
terahertz Faraday rotation of 1.5 mrad and Kerr rotation of 5.1 mrad at 2 K.
The calculated terahertz Hall conductance is 0.42 $e^2/h$. Our work shows the
optical responses of an artificially layered magnetic topological insulator,
paving the way towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect via
heterostructure engineering.

<br>
<i>E. S. Andriyakhina, P. A. Nosov, S. Raghu, I. S. Burmistrov</i>
<p>The interplay between electron-electron interactions and weak localization
(or anti-localization) phenomena in two-dimensional systems can significantly
enhance the superconducting transition temperature. We develop the theory of
quantum fluctuations within such multifractally-enhanced superconducting states
in thin films. In conditions of weak disorder, we employ the Finkel'stein
nonlinear sigma model to derive an effective action for the superconducting
order parameter and the quasiclassical Green's function, meticulously
accounting for the influence of quantum fluctuations. This effective action,
applicable for interactions of any strength, reveals the critical role of
well-known collective modes in a dirty superconductor, and its saddle point
analysis leads to modified Usadel and gap equations. These equations
comprehensively incorporate the renormalizations stemming from the interplay
between interactions and disorder, resulting in the non-trivial energy
dependence of the gap function. Notably, our analysis establishes a direct
relation between the self-consistent gap equation at the superconducting
transition temperature and the known renormalization group equations for
interaction parameters in the normal state.

<h3>Non-equilibrium ensemble theory for thermal transport in anharmonic  crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08709" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08709</a>
<br>
<i>Li Wan</i>
<p>We propose an ensemble theory for the non-equilibrium statistics to study the
thermal transport in anharmonic crystals. In the theory, lattice vibrations of
the crystals are quantized by local Bosons(LBs), instead of Phonons as usually
used for the thermal transport. LBs are driven by the temperature gradient and
move from atom to atom in the crystals. Based on the LBs, anharmonic
interactions between atoms in the crystals can be fully considered. To
demonstrate our theory, we study the thermal transport in an atomic chain with
a temperature drop applied on the two ends of the chain. We observe a Rabi-like
oscillation in the transport of the LBs, from which we define the thermal
current to get the thermal conductivity of the chain. Results show that the
thermal conductivity is enhanced slowly with the increasing of the anharmonic
interaction and decreases rapidly if the anharmonic interaction is increased
further. In the present study, we only focus on the steady state, and the
fluctuations of the thermal currents are not considered.

<h3>Induced magneto-conductivity in a two-node Weyl semimetal under Gaussian  random disorder</h3>

<br>
<i>Chuan-Xiong Xu, Hao-Ping Yu, Mei Zhou, Xuanting Ji</i>
<p>Measuring the magnetoconductivity induced from impurities may help determine
the impurity distribution and reveal the structure of a Weyl semimetal sample.
To verify this, we utilized the Gaussian random disorder to simulate charged
impurities in a two-node Weyl semimetal model and investigate the impact of
charged impurities on magnetoconductivity in Weyl semimetals. We first compute
the longitudinal magnetic conductivity and find that it is positive and
increases proportionally with the parameter governing the Gaussian distribution
of charged impurities, suggesting the presence of negative longitudinal
magnetoresistivity (NLMR). Then we consider both the intravalley and
inter-valley scattering processes to calculate the induced transverse
magnetoconductivity in the model. Our findings indicate that both inter-valley
and intra-valley scattering processes play important roles in calculating the
transverse magnetoconductivity. The locations of Weyl nodes can also be
determined by magnetoconductivity measurements. This is possible if the
magnetic field strength and the density of charged impurities are known.
Alternatively, the measurement of magnetic conductivity may reveal the
distribution of charged impurites in a given sample once the locations of the
Weyl nodes have been determined. These findings can aid in detecting the
structure of a Weyl semimetal sample, enhancing comprehension of
magnetotransport in Weyl semimetals, and promoting the development of valley
electronics.

<i>Rajat, Ritu, Arko Roy, Sandeep Gautam</i>
<p>Close to the superfluid plane-wave (PW) - supersolid stripe (ST) phase
transition point of a zero temperature quasi-one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled
Bose gas, we find that an increase in temperature induces a phase transition to
the supersolid phase with a broken translational symmetry from the superfluid
plane-wave phase. We use the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with the Popov
approximation to investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the
collective excitation spectrum and investigate the softening of the spin-dipole
mode corresponding to the shift in the quantum critical point. This is in stark
contrast to the PW-ST phase transition in a homogeneous system where non-zero
temperatures facilitate the melting of the stripe phase.

<p>The $k\cdot p$ method is significant in condensed matter physics for the
compact and analytical Hamiltonian. In the presence of magnetic field, it is
described by the effective Zeeman's coupling Hamiltonian with Land\'e $ g
$-factors. Here, we develop an open-source package VASP2KP (including two
parts: vasp2mat and mat2kp) to compute $k\cdot p$ parameters and Land\'e
$g$-factors directly from the wavefunctions provided by the density functional
theory (DFT) as implemented in Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).
First, we develop a VASP patch vasp2mat to compute matrix representations of
the generalized momentum operator $
\mathbf{\hat{\pi}}=\mathbf{\hat{p}}+\frac{1}{2mc^2}\left(\mathbf{\hat{s}}\times\nabla
V(\mathbf{r})\right) $, spin operator $\mathbf{\hat{s}}$, time reversal
operator $\hat{T}$ and crystalline symmetry operators $\hat{R}$ on the DFT
wavefunctions. Second, we develop a python code mat2kp to obtain the unitary
transformation $U$ that rotates the degenerate DFT basis towards the standard
basis, and then automatically compute the $k\cdot p$ parameters and
$g$-factors. The theory and the methodology behind VASP2KP are described in
detail. The matrix elements of the operators are derived comprehensively and
computed correctly within the projector augmented wave method. We apply this
package to some materials, e.g., Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Na$_3$Bi, Te, InAs and 1H-TMD
monolayers. The obtained effective model's dispersions are in good agreement
with the DFT data around the specific wave vector, and the $g$-factors are
consistent with experimental data. The VASP2KP package is available at

<p>The direct electrical method was used to study the behavior of the spin Hall
effect in a magnetic field perpendicular to the injection current in aluminum
samples with resistivities that differed by two orders of magnitude at a
temperature of 4.2 K. The parabolic behavior of the spin-Hall voltage curves
with maxima at the same value of the magnetic field was discovered. It was
proposed an explanation which is based on the competition of two universal
mechanisms associated with the accumulation of spins - the dependences of spin
magnetization and spin relaxation length on the magnetic field strength.

<h3>Anisotropic swelling due to hydration in fibrous biomaterials</h3>

<br>
<i>Xander A. Gouws, Laurent Kreplak, Andrew D. Rutenberg</i>
<p>Naturally occurring protein fibres often undergo anisotropic swelling when
hydrated. Within a tendon, a hydrated collagen fibril's radius expands by 40\%
but its length only increases by 5\%. The same effect, with similar magnitude,
is observed for keratin microfibrils within hair. Nevertheless, current
explanations for swelling anisotropy are based on molecular details that are
unique to each material. Here, we describe a coarse-grained liquid-crystalline
elastomer model for biomaterial hydration that allows for anisotropic swelling.
We show that our model is consistent with previously observed behavior for both
hair fibers and collagen fibrils. Despite a non-linear relationship between
water saturation and relative humidity, we find that the squared deformation in
the axial and radial directions is approximately linear with water saturation.
We further find that anisotropic swelling is linear with respect to volume and
shape changes. Hair and collagen exhibit remarkably similar behavior under
hydration. We suggest that our model may also be useful for other biomaterials
that exhibit anisotropic swelling.

<br>
<i>Victor Regis, Victor Velasco, Marcello B. Silva Neto, Caio Lewenkopf</i>
<p>We study phase transitions driven by structural disorder in noncrystalline
topological insulators. We introduce a procedural generation algorithm, the
Perlin noise, typically used in computer graphics, to incorporate disorder to a
two-dimensional lattice, allowing a continuous interpolation between a pristine
and a random gas system, going through all different intermediate structural
regimes, such as the paracrystalline and the amorphous phases. We define a
two-band model, including intraorbital and interorbital mixings, on the
structures generated by the algorithm and we find a sequence of
structure-driven topological phase transitions characterized by changes in the
topological Bott index, at which the insulating gap dynamically closes while
evolving from the Bragg planes of the Brillouin zone towards the center. We
interpret our results within the framework of Hosemann's paracrystal theory, in
which distortion is included in the lattice structure factor and renormalizes
the band-splitting parameter. Based on these results, we ultimately demonstrate
the phenomenon of topological protection at its extreme.

<p>We report the switching dynamics of antiferroelectric Lead Zirconate (PbZrO3)
free standing capacitors compared to their epitaxial counterparts. Frequency
dependence of hysteresis indicates that freestanding capacitors exhibit a lower

switching response as compared to epitaxially-clamped capacitors. As a
consequence, freestanding capacitor membranes exhibit better energy storage
density and efficiency.

<i>Hiroki Matsukiyo, Jun-ichi Fukuda</i>
<p>Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent behaviour called ``bacterial
turbulence''. The behavior of the bulk unconstrained bacterial turbulence is
described well by the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equation for the velocity
field. However, it remains unclear how we should treat boundary conditions on
bacterial turbulence in contact with some boundaries (e.g. solid walls). To be
more specific, although the importance of the ``edge current'', the flow along
the boundary, has been demonstrated in several experimental studies on confined
bacterial suspensions, previous numerical studies based on the TTSH equation
employ non-slip boundary conditions and do not seem to describe properly the
behavior of bacteria near the boundaries. In this study, we impose a slip
boundary condition on the TTSH equation to describe the bacterial motion at
boundaries. We develop a method to implement the slip boundary condition. Using
this method, we have successfully produced edge current and discovered that the
direction of the edge current temporally oscillates. The oscillation can be
attributable to the advection term in the TTSH equation. Our work demonstrates
that boundary conditions could play an important role in the collective
dynamics of active systems.

<p>The field of nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (NanoMRI) was started 30
years ago. It was motivated by the desire to image single molecules and
molecular assemblies, such as proteins and virus particles, with near-atomic
spatial resolution and on a length scale of 100 nm. Over the years, the NanoMRI
field has also expanded to include the goal of useful high-resolution nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of molecules under ambient conditions,
including samples up to the micron-scale. The realization of these goals
requires the development of spin detection techniques that are many orders of
magnitude more sensitive than conventional NMR and MRI, capable of detecting
and controlling nanoscale ensembles of spins. Over the years, a number of
different technical approaches to NanoMRI have emerged, each possessing a
distinct set of capabilities for basic and applied areas of science. The goal
of this roadmap article is to report the current state of the art in NanoMRI
technologies, outline the areas where they are poised to have impact, identify
the challenges that lie ahead, and propose methods to meet these challenges.
This roadmap also shows how developments in NanoMRI techniques can lead to
breakthroughs in emerging quantum science and technology applications.

<p>Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) with a functionalized tip apex reveals
the geometric and electronic structure of a sample within the same experiment.
However, the complex nature of the signal makes images difficult to interpret
and has so far limited most research to planar samples with a known chemical
composition. Here, we present automated structure discovery for STM (ASD-STM),
a machine learning tool for predicting the atomic structure directly from an
STM image, by building upon successful methods for structure discovery in
non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM). We apply the method on various
organic molecules and achieve good accuracy on structure predictions and
chemical identification on a qualitative level, while highlighting future
development requirements to ASD-STM. This method is directly applicable to
experimental STM images of organic molecules, making structure discovery
available for a wider SPM audience outside of nc-AFM. This work also opens
doors for more advanced machine learning methods to be developed for STM
discovery.

<p>Creating heterostructures with graphene/graphite is a practical method for
charge-doping $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, but not sufficient to cause the
insulator-to-metal transition. In this study, detailed scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy measurements on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with various lattice
deformations reveal that both in-plane and out-of-plane lattice distortions may
collapse the Mott-gap in the case of monolayer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in proximity
to graphite, but have little impact on its bulk form alone. In the Mott-Hubbard
framework, the transition is attributed to the lattice distortion-facilitated
substantial modulation of the electron correlation parameter. Observation of
the orbital textures on a highly compressed monolayer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ flake
on graphite provides valuable evidence that electrons are efficiently
transferred from the heterointerface into Cl3$p$ orbitals under the lattice
distortion. It is believed that the splitting of Ru $t_{2g}$ bands within the
trigonal distortion of Ru-Cl-Ru octahedra bonds generated the electrons
transfer pathways. The increase of the Cl3$p$ states enhance the hopping
integral in the Mott-Hubbard bands, resulting in the Mott-transition. These
findings suggest a new route for implementing the insulator-to-metal transition
upon doping in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ by deforming the lattice in addition to the
formation of heterostructure.

Two-dimensional (2D) random singlet (RS) states emerge in random $J$-$Q$ model
by destroying valence bond solid order with spatial randomness. We examine the
2D RS state in magnetic field with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The
magnetization and susceptibilities show power-law scaling with magnetic field
at low temperature. Moreover, they show one-parameter scaling behavior with
$B/T$, and the scaling functions are remarkably consistent with a
phenomenological model of random spin pairs with a singular distribution of
interactions. These universal scaling functions can be used to diagnose 2D RS
states in experiments.

<p>Grain boundaries in extremely confined colloidal smectics possess a
topological fine structure with coexisting nematic and tetratic symmetry of the
director field. An alternative way to approach the problem of smectic topology
is via the layer structure, which is typically more accessible in experiments
on molecular liquid crystals. Here, we translate the concept of endpoint
defects, which appear as tetratic disclinations of quarter charge in director
topology, to layer topology for two-dimensional smectics. By doing so, we
elaborate on further advantages of a topological concept evolving around the
layer structure rather than the director field, such as providing insight in
the structure of edge dislocations or virtual defects at the confining walls.

<p>The search for long-lived quantum memories, which can be efficiently
interfaced with flying qubits is longstanding. One possible solution is to use
the electron spin of a color center in diamond to mediate interaction between a
long-lived nuclear spin and a photon. Realizing this in a nanodiamond
furthermore facilitates the integration into photonic devices and enables the
realization of hybrid quantum systems with access to quantum memories. Here, we
investigated the spin environment of negatively-charged Silicon-Vacancy centers
in a nanodiamond and demonstrate strong coupling of its electron spin, while
the electron spin's decoherence rate remained below 1 MHz. We furthermore
demonstrate multi-spin coupling with the potential to establish registers of

<p>Solids undergoing a transition from order to disorder experience the
proliferation of topological defects. The melting process generates transient
quantum states. However, their dynamical nature with femtosecond lifetime
hinders exploration with atomic precision. Here, we suggest an alternative
approach to the dynamical melting process by focusing on the interface created
by competing degenerate quantum states. We use a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) to visualize the unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) and its spatial
progression ("static melting") across a twin domain boundary (TDB) in the
layered material GdTe$_{3}$. Combining STM with a spatial lock-in technique, we
reveal that the order parameter amplitude attenuates with the formation of
dislocations and thus two different unidirectional CDWs coexist near the TDB,
reducing the CDW anisotropy. Notably, we discover a correlation between this
anisotropy and the CDW gap. Our study provides valuable insight into the
behavior of topological defects and transient quantum states.

<p>The absence of superconductivity (SC) in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$
(CrBFA) is a well-established but poorly understood topic. It is also
established that the suppression of the spin density wave transition
temperature ($T_{\text{SDW}}$) in CrBFA and Mn-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$
(MnBFA) almost coincides as a function of the Cr/Mn concentrations,
irrespective of the putative distinct electronic effects of these
substitutions. In this work, we employ angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and combined density functional theory plus dynamical mean
field theory calculations (DFT+DMFT) to address the evolution of the Fermi
surface (FS) and electronic correlations in CrBFA. Our findings reveal that
incorporating Cr leads to an effective hole doping of the electronic structure
in a way that can be well described within the virtual crystal approximation
(VCA). Moreover, our results show orbital-specific correlation effects that
support the Hund localization scenario for the CrBFA phase diagram. We found a
fractional scaling of the imaginary part of self-energy as a function of the
binding energy, which is a signature property of Hund's metals. We conclude
that CrBFA is a correlated electron system for which the changes in the FS as a
function of Cr are not related to the suppression of $T_{\text{SDW}}$. Rather,
this suppression and the absence of SC are primarily due to the competition
between Cr local moments and the Fe-derived itinerant spin fluctuations.

<p>In the pursuit of higher critical temperature of superconductivity,
quasi-flat electronic bands and van Hove singularities in two dimensions (2D)
have emerged as a potential approach to enhance Cooper pairing on the basis of
mean-field expectations. However, these special electronic features suppress
the superfluid stiffness and, hence, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition in 2D superconducting systems, leading to the emergence of a
significant pseudogap regime due to superconducting fluctuations. In the
strong-coupling regime, one finds that superfluid stiffness is inversely
proportional to the superconducting gap, which is the predominant factor
contributing to the strong suppression of superfluid stiffness. Here we reveal
that the aforementioned limitation is avoided in a 2D superconducting
electronic system with a quasi-flat electronic band with a strong pairing
strength coupled to a deep band with weak electronic pairing strength. Owing to
the multiband effects, we demonstrate a screening-like mechanism that
circumvents the suppression of the superfluid stiffness. We report the optimal
conditions for achieving a large enhancement of the BKT transition temperature
and a substantial shrinking of the pseudogap regime by tuning the intraband
couplings and the pair-exchange coupling between the two band-condensates.

<p>Bulk V2O3 features concomitant metal-insulator (MIT) and structural (SPT)
phase transitions at TC ~ 160 K. In thin films, where the substrate clamping
can impose geometrical restrictions on the SPT, the epitaxial relation between
the V2O3 film and substrate can have a profound effect on the MIT. Here we
present a detailed characterization of domain nucleation and growth across the
MIT in (001)-oriented V2O3 films grown on sapphire. By combining scanning
electron transmission microscopy (STEM) and photoelectron emission microscopy
(PEEM), we imaged the MIT with planar and vertical resolution. We observed that
upon cooling, insulating domains nucleate at the top of the film, where strain
is lowest, and expand downwards and laterally. This growth is arrested at a
critical thickness of 50 nm from the substrate interface, leaving a persistent
bottom metallic layer. As a result, the MIT cannot take place in the interior
of films below this critical thickness. However, PEEM measurements revealed
that insulating domains can still form on a very thin superficial layer at the
top interface. Our results demonstrate the intricate spatial complexity of the
MIT in clamped V2O3, especially the strain-induced large variations along the
c-axis. Engineering the thickness-dependent MIT can provide an unconventional
way to build out-of-plane geometry devices by using the persistent bottom metal
layer as a native electrode.

<h3>Exploration of magnetoelastic deformations in spin-chain compound  CuBr$_2$</h3>

<i>Biaoyan Hu, Yingying Peng, Xiaoqiang Liu, Qizhi Li, Qiangqiang Gu, Matthew J. Krogstad, Raymond Osborn, Takashi Honda, Ji Feng, Yuan Li</i>
<p>We investigate a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnet, CuBr$_2$, which has
quasi-one-dimensional structural motifs. The system has previously been
observed to exhibit unusual Raman modes possibly due to a locally deformed
crystal structure driven by the low-dimensional magnetism. Using hard X-ray
scattering and neutron total scattering, here we aim to verify a specific form
of tetramerized lattice deformation proposed in the previous study. Apart from
diffuse scattering signals which we can reproduce by performing a thorough
modeling of the lattice's thermal vibrations, we do not observe evidence for a
tetramerized lattice structure within our detection sensitivity. As a result,
it is more likely that the unusual Raman modes in CuBr$_2$ arise from classical
magnon-phonon hybridization, rather than from quantum spin-singlet-driven
lattice deformation.

<h3>Crystal Structure Generation Based on Polyhedra using Dual Periodic  Graphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09060" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09060</a>
<br>
<i>Tomoyasu Yokoyama, Kazuhide Ichikawa, Hisashi Naito</i>
<p>Crystal structure design is important for the discovery of new highly
functional materials because crystal structure strongly influences material
properties. Crystal structures are composed of space-filling polyhedra, which
affect material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant.
However, most conventional methods of crystal structure prediction use random
structure generation methods that do not take space-filling polyhedra into
account, contributing to the inefficiency of materials development. In this
work, we propose a crystal structure generation method based on discrete
geometric analysis of polyhedra information. In our method, the shape and
connectivity of a space-filling polyhedron are represented as a dual periodic
graph, and the crystal structure is generated by the standard realization of
this graph. We demonstrate that this method can correctly generate
face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic structures
from dual periodic graphs. This work is a first step toward generating
undiscovered crystal structures based on the target polyhedra, leading to major
advances in materials design in areas including electronics and energy storage.

<br>
<i>Po-Shen Hsin, Zhu-Xi Luo, Hao-Yu Sun</i>
<p>Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools for understanding quantum
systems. However, realistic systems are often subject to disorders, dissipation
and decoherence. In many circumstances, symmetries are not exact but only on
average. This work investigates the constraints on mixed states resulting from
non-commuting average symmetries. We will focus on the cases where the
commutation relations of the average symmetry generators are violated by
nontrivial phases, and call such average symmetry anomalous. We show that
anomalous average symmetry implies degeneracy in the density matrix
eigenvalues, and present several lattice examples with average symmetries,
including XY chain, Heisenberg chain, and deformed toric code models. In
certain cases, the results can be further extended to reduced density matrices,
leading to a new lower bound on the entanglement entropy. We discuss several
applications in the contexts of many body localization, quantum channels,
entanglement phase transitions and also derive new constraints on the
Lindbladian evolution of open quantum systems.

<br>
<i>Xin Jin, Flyura Djurabekova, Etienne A. Hodille, Sabina Markelj, Kai Nordlund</i>
<p>Retention of hydrogen isotopes (protium, deuterium and tritium) in tungsten
is one of the most severe issues in design of fusion power plants, since
significant trapping of tritium may cause exceeding radioactivity safety limits
in future reactors. Hydrogen isotopes in tungsten can be detected using the
nuclear reaction analysis method in channeling mode (NRA/C). However, the
information hidden within the experimental spectra is subject to
interpretation. In this work, we propose the methodology to interpret the
response of the experimental NRA/C spectra to the specific lattice locations of
deuterium by simulations of the NRA/C spectra from atomic structures of
deuterium lattice locations as obtained from the first principles calculations.
We show that trapping conditions, i.e., states of local crystal structures
retaining deuterium, affect the lattice locations of deuterium and the change
of lattice locations can be detected by ion channeling method. By analyzing the
experimental data, we are able to determine specific information on the
deuterium trapping conditions, including the number of deuterium atoms trapped
by one vacancy as well as the presence of impurity atoms along with deuterium
in vacancies.

<h3>Efficient momentum space approach to superconductivity in quasiperiodic  systems</h3>

<i>Mao Yoshii, Sota Kitamura, Takahiro Morimoto</i>
<p>We construct an efficient momentum space approach to the superconductivity in
quasiperiodic multilayer systems. To this end, we extend the Brillouin zone
(BZ) folding method to the superconducting (SC) phases by formulating the gap
equation in the momentum space representation with the BZ folding. In this
picture, we find that the SC order parameters generally exhibit finite momenta,
which corresponds to the spatial fluctuation of the SC order in quasiperiodic
multilayers. We apply the BZ folding method to a one dimensional model of
quasiperiodic superconductors and demonstrate its numerical efficiency compared
to the conventional method based on the real space representation with a large
system size.

<i>Sumner B. Harris, Christopher M. Rouleau, Kai Xiao, Rama K. Vasudevan</i>
<p>Materials synthesis platforms that are designed for autonomous
experimentation are capable of collecting multimodal diagnostic data that can
be utilized for feedback to optimize material properties. Pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) is emerging as a viable autonomous synthesis tool, and so the
need arises to develop machine learning (ML) techniques that are capable of
extracting information from in situ diagnostics. Here, we demonstrate that
intensified-CCD image sequences of the plasma plume generated during PLD can be
used for anomaly detection and the prediction of thin film growth kinetics. We
developed a multi-output (2$+$1)D convolutional neural network regression model
that extracts deep features from plume dynamics that not only correlate with
the measured chamber pressure and incident laser energy, but more importantly,
predict parameters of an auto-catalytic film growth model derived from in situ
laser reflectivity experiments. Our results are the first demonstration of how
ML with in situ plume diagnostics data in PLD can be utilized to maintain
deposition conditions in an optimal regime. Further, the predictive
capabilities of plume dynamics on the kinetics of film growth or other film
properties prior to deposition provides a means for rapid pre-screening of
growth conditions for the non-expert, which promises to accelerate materials
optimization with PLD.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered significant attention in recent
years due to their atomically thin structure and unique electronic and
optoelectronic properties. To harness their full potential for applications in
next-generation electronics and photonics, precise control over the dielectric
environment surrounding the 2D material is critical. The lack of nucleation
sites on 2D surfaces to form thin, uniform dielectric layers often leads to
interfacial defects that degrade the device performance, posing a major
roadblock in the realization of 2D-based devices. Here, we demonstrate a
wafer-scale, low-temperature process (< 250 {\deg}C) using atomic layer
deposition (ALD) for the synthesis of uniform, conformal amorphous boron
nitride (aBN) thin films. ALD deposition temperatures between 125 and 250
{\deg}C result in stoichiometric films with high oxidative stability, yielding
a dielectric strength of 8.2 MV/cm. Utilizing a seed-free ALD approach, we form
uniform aBN dielectric layers on 2D surfaces and fabricate multiple quantum
well structures of aBN/MoS2 and aBN-encapsulated double-gated monolayer (ML)
MoS2 field-effect transistors to evaluate the impact of aBN dielectric
environment on MoS2 optoelectronic and electronic properties. Our work in
scalable aBN dielectric integration paves a way towards realizing the
theoretical performance of 2D materials for next-generation electronics.

<h3>Nonlocal damping of spin waves in a magnetic insulator induced by  normal, heavy, or altermagnetic metallic overlayer: a Schwinger-Keldysh field  theory approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09140" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09140</a>
<br>
<i>Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Branislav K. Nikolic</i>
<p>Understanding spin wave (SW) damping, and how to control it to the point of
being able to amplify SW-mediated signals, is one of the key requirements to
bring the envisaged magnonic technologies to fruition. Even widely used
magnetic insulators with low magnetization damping in their bulk, such as
yttrium iron garnet, exhibit 100-fold increase in SW damping due to inevitable
contact with metallic layers in magnonic circuits, as observed in very recent
experiments [I. Bertelli et al., Adv. Quantum Technol. 4, 2100094 (2021)]
mapping SW damping in spatially-resolved fashion. Here, we provide microscopic
and rigorous understanding of wavevector-dependent SW damping using extended
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with nonlocal damping tensor, instead of
conventional local scalar Gilbert damping, as derived from Schwinger-Keldysh
nonequilibrium quantum field theory. In this picture, the origin of nonlocal
magnetization damping and thereby induced wavevector-dependent SW damping is
interaction of localized magnetic moments of magnetic insulator with conduction
electrons from the examined three different types of metallic overlayers --
normal, heavy, and altermagnetic. Due to spin-split energy-momentum dispersion
of conduction electrons in the latter two cases, the nonlocal damping is
anisotropic in spin and space, and it can be dramatically reduced by changing
the relative orientation of the two layers when compared to the usage of normal
metal overlayer.

<p>Here, we present a study of the influence of microstructure on the magnetic
properties of polycrystalline samples of the La1.5Sr0.5CoMnO6 double
perovskite, with primary attention to the spontaneous exchange bias effect, a
fascinating recently discovered phenomena for which some materials exhibit
unidirectional magnetic anisotropy after being cooled in zero magnetic field.
By sintering La1.5Sr0.5CoMnO6 at different temperatures, we obtained samples
with distinct average grain sizes, ranging from 0.76(21) to 4.95(1.73) mu_m. A
detailed investigation of the material's structural, morphologic, electronic,
and magnetic properties using X-ray powder diffraction, powder neutron
diffraction, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, scanning
electron microscopy, and AC and DC magnetometry has revealed a systematic
enhancement of the exchange bias effect with increasing the grain size and the
intergrain coalescence. Our results regarding the strengthening of the exchange
coupling at the grain interfaces and its influence on the dynamics of the spin
glass-like moments present in the samples are discussed.

<p>It is well known that, when in a thermal bath, a Knudsen gas may reach a
nonequilibrium steady state; often, this is not treated as a thermodynamic
problem. Here, we show that if incorporated in a large-sized setup, such a
phenomenon has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics:
cold-to-hot heat transfer may spontaneously occur without an energetic penalty,
either cyclically (with entropy barriers) or continuously (with an energy
barrier). As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, the second law
of thermodynamics cannot be applied.

<p>Associative polymer networks have shown a major promise in fabrication of
self-healing and responsive materials. The can also serve as simple models to
study more complex biological systems where transient interactions play an
important role. In this work we investigate the properties of charged polymer
blends whose constituents are capable of creating dynamic bonds. We model
dynamic bonds as harmonic springs with additional bond formation energy,
$\varepsilon_a$, which can be adjusted to influence the reaction rates for
binding and unbinding. We show that varying the number of binding sites on the
chains and $\varepsilon_a$ has a major effect on the resulting phase diagram.
We further investigate the diffusive behaviour of the coacervates. We also
study, how the network structure changes with varying number of active site,
and increasing $\varepsilon_a$, and identify the values which result in the
network percolation. Lastly, we explore the possibility of inducing orthogonal
phase separation by by introducing a second type of binding site, which cannot
interact with the first kind.

<p>Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is an effect that has recently
attracted a great deal of attention in chiral chemistry and that remains to be
understood. In the CISS effect, electrons passing through chiral molecules
acquire a large degree of spin polarization. In this Letter we show that this
effect can be spectacularly large in atomically-thin chiral crystals created by
van der Waals assembly, provided they are spin-orbit coupled. Its origin stems
from the combined effects of structural chirality and spin-flipping spin-orbit
coupling. We present detailed calculations for twisted homobilayer transition
metal dichalcogenides, showing that the chirality-induced spin polarization can
be giant, e.g. easily exceeding $50\%$ for ${\rm MoTe}_2$. Our results clearly
indicate that twisted quantum materials can operate as a fully tunable platform
for the study and control of the CISS effect in condensed matter physics and
chiral chemistry.

<p>Spin waves (magnons) can enable wave-based neuromorphic computing by which
one aims at overcoming limitations inherent to conventional electronics and the
von Neumann architecture. In this study, we explore the storage of magnon
signals and the magnetization switching of periodic and aperiodic arrays of
Ni81Fe19 (Py) nanostripes with widths (w) between 50 nm and 200 nm. Spin waves
excited with low microwave power in yttrium iron garnet induce the reversal of
the nanostripes of different w in a small opposing field. Exploiting
microwave-to-magnon transducers for magnon modes with ultrashort wavelengths,
we demonstrate the reversal of 50-nm-wide Py nanostripes by magnons with
wavelength ~ 100 nm after they have propagated over 25 micrometer in YIG. The
findings are important for designing a magnon-based in-memory computing device.

<p>In order to obtain reliable and close to the experimental transport
properties, it is necessary to have a good description of the structural,

defect formation plays a crucial hole, specially when it has a small formation
energy. In this study we have calculated, under the Density Functional Theory
(DFT) formalism, the formation energy for five different models of defects,
where one of them is interstitial and the other four substitutional. The
interstitial Pd defect presented a very low formation energy, while the other
defects have shown higher energies and, therefore they are less likely to
emerge in the synthesis of the material.

<p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer
nickelate, specifically La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, has generated significant interest
in the exploration of high-temperature superconductivity within this material
family. In this study, we present the crystallographic and electrical
resistivity properties of two distinct Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: the
bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (referred to as 2222-phase) and a previously
uncharacterized phase, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-phase). The 2222-phase is
characterized by a pseudo $F$-centered orthorhombic lattice, featuring bilayer
perovskite [LaNiO$_3$] layers interspaced by rock salt [LaO] layers, forming a
repeated ...2222... sequence. Intriguingly, the 1313-phase, which displays
semiconducting properties, crystallizes in the $Cmmm$ space group and exhibits
a pronounced predilection for a $C$-centered orthorhombic lattice. Within this
structure, the perovskite [LaNiO$_3$] layers exhibit a distinctive long-range
ordered arrangement, alternating between single- and trilayer configurations,
resulting in a ...1313... sequence. This report contributes to novel insights
into the crystallography and the structure-property relationship of
Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, paving the way for further investigations into

<br>
<i>Rubén Seoane Souto, Martin Leijnse, Constantin Schrade, Marco Valentini, Georgios Katsaros, Jeroen Danon</i>
<p>Josephson diodes are superconducting elements that show an asymmetry in the
critical current depending on the direction of the current. Here, we
theoretically explore how an alternating current bias can tune the response of
such a diode. We show that for slow driving there is always a regime where the
system can only carry zero-voltage dc current in one direction, thus
effectively behaving as an ideal Josephson diode. Under fast driving, the diode
efficiency is also tunable, although the ideal regime cannot be reached in this
case. We also investigate the residual dissipation due to the time-dependent
current bias and show that it remains small. All our conclusions are solely
based on the critical current asymmetry of the junction, and are thus
compatible with any Josephson diode.

<i>Anffany Chen</i>
<p>We investigate the many-body localization transition in strongly correlated
fermionic systems on disordered 1D and 2D lattices using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Our approach involves supervised training of CNNs with
labelled many-body wavefunctions at the infinitesimal and strong disorder
limits. These trained CNNs, when applied to wavefunctions near the transition
region, facilitate the construction of energy-resolved phase diagrams which
reveal many-body mobility edges in both 1D and 2D systems. We provide
finite-size estimates of critical disorder strengths at $W_c\sim2.8$ for 1D and
$W_c\sim9.8$ for 2D systems. Our results agree the analyses of energy level
statistics and inverse participation ratio. By examining the CNN's
convolutional layer, we unveil its feature extraction mechanism which
effectively highlights the pronounced peaks in the localized many-body
wavefunctions.

<p>Nanofabricated metal gate electrodes are commonly used to confine and control
electrons in electrostatically defined quantum dots. However, these same gates
impart a complicated strain geometry that affects the confinement potential and
potentially impairs device functionality. Here we investigate strain-induced
fluctuations of the potential energy in Si/SiGe heterostructures, caused by (i)
lattice mismatch, (ii) materials-dependent thermal contraction, and (iii)
deposition stress in the metal gates. By simulating different gate geometries,
ranging from simple to realistically complicated, and including features like
overlapping metal and oxide layers, we can explain most observed strain
features. In particular, we show that strain-induced potential fluctuations can
be suppressed by employing overlapping gates that cover the whole active
region, when the oxide layers are thin. These results suggest that strain
effects should not present a serious challenge to qubit uniformity when
following simple design rules.

<i>Olga Arroyo-Gascon, Sergio Bravo, Leonor Chico, Monica Pacheco</i>
<p>We perform a systematic study of the signatures of fragile topology in a
number of nonmagnetic two-dimensional materials belonging to space group 164,
most of them transition metal dichalcogenides. Using group theory analysis in
the framework of topological quantum chemistry, we find fragile bands near the
Fermi level for all the materials studied. Since stable topological bands are
also present in these systems, the interplay of both phases is discussed,
showing that corner charges appear in nearly three quarters of the materials
and that they are caused by fragile topology. Using first-principles
calculations, we predict corner states with fractional corner charges protected
by C3 symmetry. Our work aims to broaden the scope of materials with
experimentally accessible fragile bands.

<i>Ankita Chakrabarti, Nicolas Laflorencie, Bertrand Georgeot, Cyril Martins, Gabriel Lemarié</i>
<p>Interacting fermions in the presence of disorder pose one of the most
challenging problems in condensed matter physics, primarily due to the absence
of accurate numerical tools. Our investigation delves into the intricate
interplay between interaction-induced Mott insulation and disorder-driven
Anderson localization in the Hubbard model subjected to a random potential. On
the Cayley tree, the application of statistical dynamical mean-field theory
proves adept at discerning among a metal and the two distinct insulators,
Anderson or Mott. Our comprehensive analysis, accounting for subtle yet potent
finite-size effects and fluctuations, yields a noteworthy finding: in the
presence of disorder, we consistently observe an intervening Anderson-localized
regime between the metallic and Mott insulator states. This observation
intriguingly mirrors scenarios witnessed in dirty Bosons, where an insulating
Bose glass phase consistently emerges between the superfluid and Mott phases.

<p>Coarsening of an isolated far-from-equilibrium quantum system is a
paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, relevant from subnuclear to cosmological
lengthscales, and predicted to feature universal dynamic scaling. Here, we
observe universal scaling in the coarsening of a homogeneous two-dimensional
Bose gas, with exponents that match analytical predictions. For different
initial states, we reveal universal scaling in the experimentally accessible
finite-time dynamics by elucidating and accounting for the
initial-state-dependent prescaling effects. The methods we introduce are
applicable to any quantitative study of universality far from equilibrium.

<p>New generations of ultracold-atom experiments are continually raising the
demand for efficient solutions to optimal control problems. Here, we apply
Bayesian optimization to improve a state-preparation protocol recently
implemented in an ultracold-atom system to realize a two-particle fractional
quantum Hall state. Compared to manual ramp design, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our optimization approach in a numerical simulation - resulting
in a protocol that is 10x faster at the same fidelity, even when taking into
account experimentally realistic levels of disorder in the system. We
extensively analyze and discuss questions of robustness and the relationship
between numerical simulation and experimental realization, and how to make the
best use of the surrogate model trained during optimization. We find that
numerical simulation can be expected to substantially reduce the number of
experiments that need to be performed with even the most basic transfer
learning techniques. The proposed protocol and workflow will pave the way
toward the realization of more complex many-body quantum states in experiments.
