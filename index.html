<h3>Quantum fluctuating theory for one-dimensional shock waves</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08875" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08875</a>

</p><i>Andrew Urilyon, Stefano Scopa, Giuseppe Del Vecchio Del Vecchio, Jacopo De Nardis</i>
<p>We study the formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves in
repulsive one-dimensional Bose gases during the free expansion of a density
hump. By building coherent Fermi states for interacting Bethe fermions, we
define a quantum fluctuating initial state expressed in terms of universal
quantities, namely the density and the Luttinger parameter. In the integrable
case, this fluctuating state is then evolved by generalized hydrodynamics (GHD)
and, differently from non-fluctuating initial states, it develops density
ripples on top of the hydrodynamic mean value. Our analysis gives a general
theory of quantum ripples and wave breaking in integrable and quasi-integrable
one-dimensional liquids and clarifies the role of the interaction strength. In
particular, for strongly/intermediately interacting bosons, we find quantum
ripples originating from low-energy modes at the Fermi surface interfering when
transported by GHD. In the low coupling limit, near the quasicondensate regime,
we find instead that density ripples have a semi-classical nature, and their
description requires information on the curvature of the Fermi surface.

<h3>Hydrodynamic behavior near dynamical criticality of a facilitated  conservative lattice gas</h3>

</p><i>Clément Erignoux, Alexandre Roget, Assaf Shapira, Marielle Simon</i>
<p>We investigate a $2d$-conservative lattice gas exhibiting a dynamical
active-absorbing phase transition with critical density $\rho_c$. We derive the
hydrodynamic equation for this model, showing that all critical exponents
governing the large scale behavior near criticality can be obtained from two
independent ones. We show that as the supercritical density approaches
criticality, distinct length scales naturally appear. Remarkably, this behavior
is different from the subcritical one. Numerical simulations support the
critical relations and the scale separation.

<h3>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical  Matter</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jesse Osborne, Ian P. McCulloch, Jad C. Halimeh</i>
<p>Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of
weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models,
particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions.
However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs
with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial
dimension tend to vanish in $d{>}1$, it is important to probe this question.
Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we
show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM),
as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked
slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in
the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter
degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed
light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and
highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our
findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and
we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog
quantum simulator.

<h3>Finite temperature electric field induced two-dimensional coherent  nonlinear spectroscopy in a Kitaev magnet</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08867" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08867</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wolfram Brenig, Olesia Krupnitska</i>
<p>We study electric field induced two-dimensional coherent nonlinear optical
spectroscopy (2DCS) in a Kitaev magnet at finite temperature. We show that 2DCS
is susceptible to both types of fractional quasiparticles of this quantum
spin-liquid, i.e., fermions and flux visons. Focusing on the second order
response, we find a strong antidiagonal feature in the two-dimensional
frequency plane, related to the galvanoelectric effect of the fractional
fermions. Perpendicular to the antidiagonal, the width of this feature is set
by quasiparticle relaxation rates beyond the bare Kitaev magnet, thereby
providing access to single-particle characteristics within the multi-particle
2DCS continuum. While the structure of the 2DCS susceptibility stems from the
fermionic quasiparticles and displays Fermi blocking versus temperature, the
emergent bond randomness which arises due to thermally populated visons
strongly modifies the fermionic spectrum. Therefore also the presence of gauge
excitations is manifest in the 2DCS susceptibility as the temperature is
increased beyond the flux proliferation crossover. Our results are consistent
with and extend previous findings on second harmonic generation in Kitaev
magnets.

<h3>Origin of light-induced metastability in ZrTe$_5$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08881" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08881</a>
<br>
</p><i>D. Nevola, N. Aryal, G.D. Gu, P.D. Johnson, W.-G. Yin, Q. Li</i>
<p>We study the non-equilibrium electronic structure of a model Dirac semimetal
ZrTe$_5$ by using time-and-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
density functional theory-based electron and phonon calculations. By measuring
the electronic dispersion near the $\Gamma$ point at time delays up to 10
picoseconds, we discovered that the band spectral weight does not recover
during the measured temporal window, revealing the existence of light induced
metastable state in the electronic structure of this material. Our calculations
find that the photoexcited $A_{1g}$ phonon mode lead to a band renormalization
that both supports our experimental observations at the zone center and
predicts changes to the band structure outside of our experimental window,
ultimately showing the evolution from a direct to an indirect gap semimetal;
such band renormalization dramatically reduces the electron-hole recombination
rate giving rise to the metastability in this system.

<h3>Weyl superconductivity and quasiperiodic Majorana arcs in quasicrystals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08889</a>
<br>
</p><i>Masahiro Hori, Ryo Okugawa, K. Tanaka, Takami Tohyama</i>
<p>Weyl superconductivity is a topological phase in three-dimensional crystals
in which the Weyl equation describes quasiparticle excitation near
band-touching points in momentum space called Weyl nodes. For quasicrystals
which lack translational symmetry, a theory of Weyl superconductivity has not
been established, in spite of recent extensive studies on quasicrystalline
topological phases. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of quasicrystalline
Weyl superconductivity by extending the definition of Weyl superconductivity to
periodically stacked, two-dimensional superconducting quasicrystals. We
identify quasicrystalline Weyl nodes -- topologically protected point nodes in
one-dimensional momentum space corresponding to the stacking direction -- in
terms of a topological invariant given by a change in the Bott index in
quasicrystalline layers. We find that these Weyl nodes exist in pairs and that
Majorana zero-energy modes protected by the nonzero Bott index between a pair
of quasicrystalline Weyl nodes appear on surfaces. These Majorana zero modes
form an infinite number of arcs in momentum space, densely and
quasiperiodically distributed as a function of momentum in the direction of
surfaces within each quasicrystalline layer. In Ammann-Beenker (Penrose)
quasicrystals, the quasiperiodicity of Majorana arcs is governed by the silver
(golden) ratio associated with the quasicrystalline structure.

<h3>Noninvasive identification of carbon-based black pigments with  pump-probe microscopy</h3>

</p><i>Heidi V. Kastenholz, Michael I. Topper, Warren S. Warren, Martin C. Fischer, David Grass</i>
<p>Carbon-based black pigments, a widely used class of pigments, are difficult
to differentiate with the noninvasive techniques currently used in cultural
heritage science. We utilize pump-probe microscopy to distinguish four common
carbon-based black pigments as pure pigments, as two-component black pigment
mixtures, and as a mixture of a black and a colorful pigment. This work also
demonstrates that even nominally homogeneous pigments present remarkable, and
useful, heterogeneity in pump-probe microscopy.

<h3>Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in 3He superfluids in zero temperature  limit</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08905" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08905</a>
<br>
</p><i>V.B. Eltsov, J.J. Hosio, M. Krusius</i>
<p>In rotating 3He superfluids the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of the AB
interface has been found to follow the theoretical model above 0.4 Tc. A
deviation from this dependence has been assumed possible at the lowest
temperatures. Our NMR and thermal bolometer measurements down to 0.2 Tc show
that the critical KH rotation velocity follows the extrapolation from higher
temperatures. We interpret this to mean that the KH instability is a bulk
phenomenon and is not compromised by interactions with the wall of the rotating
container, although weak pinning of the interface to the wall is observed
during slow sweeping of the magnetic field. The KH measurement provides the
only so far existing determination of the interfacial AB surface tension as a
function of pressure and temperature down to 0.2 Tc.

<h3>Electrically Tunable Spin Exchange Splitting in Graphene Hybrid  Heterostructure</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Dongwon Shin, Hyeonbeom Kim, Sung Ju Hong, Sehwan Song, Yeongju Choi, Youngkuk Kim, Sungkyun Park, Dongseok Suh, Woo Seok Choi</i>
<p>Graphene, with spin and valley degrees of freedom, fosters unexpected
physical and chemical properties for the realization of next-generation quantum
devices. However, the spin symmetry of graphene is rather robustly protected,
hampering manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom for the application of
spintronic devices such as electric gate tunable spin filters. We demonstrate
that a hybrid heterostructure composed of graphene and LaCoO3 epitaxial thin
film exhibits an electrically tunable spin exchange splitting. The large and
adjustable spin exchange splitting of 155.9 - 306.5 meV was obtained by the
characteristic shifts in both the spin symmetry broken quantum Hall states and
the Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations. Strong hybridization induced charge
transfer across the hybrid heterointerface has been identified for the observed
spin exchange splitting. The substantial and facile controllability of the spin
exchange splitting provides an opportunity for spintronics applications with
the electrically-tunable spin polarization in hybrid heterostructures.

<h3>Impacts of Point Defects on Shallow Doping in Cubic Boron Arsenide: A  First Principles Study</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09013" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09013</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shuxiang Zhou, Zilong Hua, Kaustubh K. Bawane, Hao Zhou, Tianli Feng</i>
<p>Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) stands out as a promising material for advanced
electronics, thanks to its exceptional thermal conductivity and ambipolar
mobility. However, effective control of p- and n-type doping in BAs poses a
significant challenge, mostly as a result of the influence of defects. In the
present study, we employed density functional theory to explore the impacts of
the common point defects and impurity on p-type doping Be$_\text{B}$ and
Si$_\text{As}$, and n-type doping Si$_\text{B}$ and Se$_\text{As}$. We find
that the most favorable points defects formed by C, O, and Si are
C$_\text{As}$, O$_\text{B}$O$_\text{As}$, Si$_\text{As}$,
C$_\text{As}$Si$_\text{B}$, and O$_\text{B}$Si$_\text{As}$, which have
formation energies of less than $1.5$ eV. For p-type doping, C, O, and Si
impurities do not harm the shallow state of Be$_\text{B}$ doping, while only O
impurity detrimentally affects Si$_\text{As}$ doping. However for n-type
dopings, C, O, and Si impurities are all harmful. Interestingly, the antisite
defect pair As$_\text{B}$B$_\text{As}$ benefits both p- and n-type doping. The
doping limitation analysis presented in this study can potentially pave the way
for strategic development in the area of BAs-based electronics.

<h3>A Processing Route to Chalcogenide Perovskites Alloys with Tunable Band  Gap via Anion Exchange</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kevin Ye, Ida Sadeghi, Michael Xu, Jack Van Sambeek, Tao Cai, Jessica Dong, Rishabh Kothari, James M. LeBeau, R. Jaramillo</i>
<p>We demonstrate synthesis of BaZr(S,Se)3 chalcogenide perovskite alloys by
selenization of BaZrS3 thin films. The anion-exchange process produces films
with tunable composition and band gap without changing the orthorhombic
perovskite crystal structure or the film microstructure. The direct band gap is
tunable between 1.5 and 1.9 eV. The alloy films made in this way feature 100x
stronger photoconductive response and a lower density of extended defects,
compared to alloy films made by direct growth. The perovskite structure is
stable in high-selenium-content thin films with and without epitaxy. The
manufacturing-compatible process of selenization in H2Se gas may spur the
development of chalcogenide perovskite solar cell technology.

<br>
</p><i>Satoru Hayami, Hiroaki Kusunose</i>
<p>We overview recent developments of electronic orderings and associated cross
correlations in condensed matter physics based on a complete set of multipole
representations (electric, magnetic, electric toroidal, and magnetic toroidal
multipoles) with distinct space-time inversion symmetries. By means of the
symmetry-adapted complete basis set in any physical Hilbert space including
atomic and cluster degrees of freedom, it provides a unified description of
electronic orderings, deformations of band structures, cross correlations, and
transport properties in solids. We review that a multipole representation is a
powerful tool to attain a comprehensive understanding of various electronic
properties and physical phenomena observed in materials. We also demonstrate
how to identify active multipoles and expected physical phenomena in real
materials with several examples. Our review would serve as a solid foundation
for future studies toward observations and identifications of unknown
electronic phases and their related physical phenomena.

<h3>Relative Resolution: An Analysis with the Kullback-Leibler Entropy</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09061</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mark Chaimovich, Aviel Chaimovich</i>
<p>A novel type of a multiscale approach, called Relative Resolution (RelRes),
can correctly retrieve the behavior of various nonpolar liquids, whilst
speeding up molecular simulations by almost an order of magnitude. In this
approach in a single system, molecules switch their resolution in terms of
their relative separation, with near neighbors interacting via fine-grained
potentials yet far neighbors interacting via coarse-grained potentials;
notably, these two potentials are analytically parameterized by a multipole
approximation. Our current work focuses on analyzing RelRes by relating it with
the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Entropy, which is a useful metric for multiscale
errors. In particular, we thoroughly examine the exact and approximate versions
of this informatic measure for several alkane systems. By analyzing its
dependency on the system size, we devise a formula for predicting the exact KL
Entropy of an "infinite" system via the computation of the approximate KL
Entropy of an "infinitesimal" system. Demonstrating that the KL Entropy can
holistically capture many multiscale errors, we settle bounds for the KL
Entropy that ensure a sufficient representation of the structural and thermal
behavior by the RelRes algorithm. This, in turn, allows the scientific
community for readily determining the ideal switching distance for an arbitrary
RelRes system.

<h3>Exact theory of the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi  polarons with multiple particle-hole excitations: Diagrammatic theory versus  Chevy ansatz</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09064" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09064</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hui Hu, Jia Wang, Xia-Ji Liu</i>
<p>By using both diagrammatic theory and Chevy ansatz approach, we derive an
exact set of equations, which determines the spectral function of Fermi
polarons with multiple particle-hole excitations at nonzero temperature. In the
diagrammatic theory, we find out the complete series of Feynman diagrams for
the multi-particle vertex functions, when the unregularized contact interaction
strength becomes infinitesimal, a typical situation occurring in two- or three-
dimensional free space. The latter Chevy ansatz approach is more widely
applicable, allowing a nonzero interaction strength. We clarify the equivalence
of the two approaches for an infinitesimal interaction strength and show that
the variational coefficients in the Chevy ansatz are precisely the on-shell
multi-particle vertex functions divided by an excitation energy. Truncated to a
particular order of particle-hole excitations, our exact set of equations can
be used to numerically calculate the finite-temperature polaron spectral
function, once the numerical singularities in the equations are appropriately
treated. As a concrete example, we calculate the finite-temperature spectral
function of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices, taking into account all
the two-particle-hole excitations. We show that the inclusion of
two-particle-hole excitations quantitatively improve the predictions on the
polaron spectral function. Our results provide a useful way to solve the
challenge problem of accurately predicting the finite-temperature spectral
function of Fermi polarons in three-dimensional free space. In addition, our
clarification of the complete set of Feynman diagrams for the multi-particle
polaron vertex functions may inspire the development of more accurate
diagrammatic theories of population-imbalanced strongly interacting Fermi
gases, beyond the conventional many-body $T$-matrix approximation.

<h3>Monte Carlo Spin Simulations of Magnetic Noise -- The Search for  Pivoting</h3>

<br>
</p><i>D. L. Mickelsen, Ruqian Wu, Clare C. Yu</i>
<p>Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) show great promise as
quantum bits (qubits) but continue to be hindered by flux noise. The flux noise
power spectra of SQUIDs go as $1/f^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the
temperature-dependent noise exponent. Experiments find $0.5 \lesssim \alpha
\lesssim 1$. Furthermore, experiments find that the noise power spectra versus
frequency at different temperatures pivot about or cross at a common point for
each SQUID. To try to better understand the results and motivated by
experimental evidence that magnetic moments on the surface of SQUIDS produce
flux noise, we present the results of our Monte Carlo simulations of various
spin systems on 2D lattices. We find that only spin glasses produce $\alpha
\sim 1$ at low temperature. We find that aliasing of the noise power spectra at
high frequencies can lead to spectral pivoting if it is in proximity to a knee
at a slightly lower frequency. We show that the pivot frequency depends on the
method of site selection and how often the magnetization is recorded. The
spectral pivoting that occurs in our simulations is due to aliasing and does
not explain the spectral pivoting of experiments.

<p>We study the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the
Neel-paramagnetic quantum phase transition in the two-dimensional (2D)
dimerized S = 1/2 Heisenberg model. We focus on the scaling correction in the
short-time region. A unified scaling form including both short-time and
finite-size corrections is proposed. According to this full scaling form,
improved short-imaginary-time scaling relations are obtained. We numerically
verify the scaling form and the improved short-time scaling relations for
different initial states using projector quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.

<h3>Subsystem Symmetry Fractionalization and Foliated Field Theory</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Po-Shen Hsin, David T. Stephen, Arpit Dua, Dominic J. Williamson</i>
<p>Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched
by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that
appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently
discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that
occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In
this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through
new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry
into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry
fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form
symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support
previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work
expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem
symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.

<h3>Quantum emitters in van der Waals α-MoO3</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jeonghan Lee, Haiyuan Wang, Keun-Yeol Park, Soonsang Huh, Donghan Kim, Mihyang Yu, Changyoung Kim, Kristian Sommer Thygesen, Jieun Lee</i>
<p>Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building
blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently,
single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in
transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the
potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional
materials. Here, we report the observation of single-photon generation from
exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals
{\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a
clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 100
kcounts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. Also, the zero-phonon
lines of these emitters are distributed in a spectrally narrow energy range.
The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a
possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and
brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize
photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.

<h3>Spin-Orbit Coupled Insulators and Metals on the Verge of Kitaev Spin  Liquids in Ilmenite Heterostructures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09112</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yi-Feng Zhao, Seong-Hoon Jang, Yukitoshi Motome</i>
<p>Competition and cooperation between electron correlation and relativistic
spin-orbit coupling give rise to diverse exotic quantum phenomena in solids. An
illustrative example is spin-orbit entangled quantum liquids, which exhibit
remarkable features such as topological orders and fractional excitations. The
Kitaev honeycomb model realizes such interesting states, called the Kitaev spin
liquids, but its experimental feasibility is still challenging. Here we
theoretically investigate hexagonal heterostructures including a candidate for
the Kitaev magnets, MgIrO$_3$, to actively manipulate the electronic and
magnetic properties toward realizing the Kitaev spin liquids. For three
different structure types of ilmenite bilayers MgIrO$_3$/$A$TiO$_3$ with $A$ =
Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, we obtain the optimized lattice structures, the electronic
band structures, the stable magnetic orders, and the effective magnetic
couplings. We find that the spin-orbital coupled bands characterized by the
pseudospin $j_{\rm eff}=$ 1/2 are retained in the MgIrO$_3$ layer for all the
heterostructures, but the magnetic state and the band gap depend on the types
of heterostructures as well as the $A$ atoms. In particular, one type becomes
metallic irrespective of $A$, while the other two are mostly insulating. We
show that the insulating cases provide spin-orbit coupled Mott insulating
states with dominant Kitaev-type interactions, accompanied by different
combinations of subdominant interactions depending on the heterostructural type
and $A$, while the metallic cases realize spin-orbit coupled metals with
various doping rates. Our results indicate that these hexagonal
heterostructures are a good platform for engineering electronic and magnetic
properties of the spin-orbital coupled correlated materials, including the
possibility of Majorana Fermi surfaces and topological superconductivity.

<h3>Effects of Structural Variations to X-ray Absorption Spectra of  g-C$_3$N$_4$: Insights from DFT and TDDFT Simulations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09115" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09115</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jun-Rong Zhang, Sheng-Yu Wang, Minrui Wei, Qiang Fu, Weijie Hua</i>
<p>X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely employed for structure
characterization of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$) and its composites.
Nevertheless, even for pure g-C$_3$N$_4$, discrepancies in energy and profile
exist across different experiments, which can be attributed to variations in
structures arising from diverse synthesis conditions and calibration
procedures. Here, we conducted a theoretical investigation on XAS of three
representative g-C$_3$N$_4$ structures (planar, corrugated, and
micro-corrugated) optimized with different strategies, to understand the
structure-spectroscopy relation. Different methods were compared, including
density functional theory (DFT) with the full (FCH) or equivalent (ECH)
core-hole approximation, as well as the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). FCH was
responsible for getting accurate absolute absorption energy; while ECH and
TDDFT aided in interpreting the spectra, through ECH-state canonical molecular
orbitals (ECH-CMOs) and natural transition orbitals (NTOs), respectively. With
each method, the spectra at the three structures show evident differences,
which can be correlated to different individual experiments or in between. Our
calculations explained the structural reason behind the spectral discrepancies
among different experiments. Moreover, profiles predicted by these methods also
displayed consistency, so their differences can be used as a reliable indicator
of their accuracy. Both ECH-CMOs and NTO particle orbitals led to similar
graphics, validating their applicability in interpreting the transitions. This
work provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure-XAS relation for
g-C$_3$N$_4$, provides concrete explanations for the spectral differences
reported in various experiments, and offers insight for future structure
dynamical and transient X-ray spectral analyses.

<h3>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total  Spin</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Preethi G, Shovan Dutta</i>
<p>Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits
sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question:
How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground
state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families
with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e.,
spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and
(ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing
the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the
level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the
magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and
continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our
findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider
exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.

<p>Medical diagnostic testing can be made significantly more efficient using
pooled testing protocols. These typically require a sparse infection signal and
use either binary or real-valued entries of O(1). However, existing methods do
not allow for inferring viral loads which span many orders of magnitude. We
develop a message passing algorithm coupled with a PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction) specific noise function to allow accurate inference of realistic
viral load signals. This work is in the non-adaptive setting and could open the
possibility of efficient screening where viral load determination is clinically
important.

<h3>Stoner ferromagnetism, correlated metal and thermoelectricity in  partially flat-band materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09147" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09147</a>
<br>
</p><i>Leyla Majidi, Abolhassan Vaezi, Mehdi Kargarian</i>
<p>Recent discovery of correlated electronic phases in twisted heterostructures
raised a surge of interests in studying models and materials with flat bands
where the electronic excitations are nearly dispersionless in momentum space.
As such, the kinetic energy is quenched and the correlations are enhanced,
giving rise to a plethora of unusual magnetic, superconducting and transport
behaviors. Finding materials whose energy bands are completely flat is rather
challenging, yet those whose dispersion is flat only in a portion of the
momentum space might be more accessible in material search. In this work, we
propose a partially flat-band system on a square lattice. Using the Hubbard
model, it is demonstrated that the suppression of the electronic kinetic energy
in the flat portion of the band dispersion drives the system to Stoner
ferromagnetism even at very weak interactions, i.e., much smaller than the
bandwidth, with significantly enhanced Curie temperature. While the low-energy
magnon modes are well defined collective excitations, flat magnon bands can be
observed at high energies. We show that the strong interaction leads to
reduction of the flat portion of the magnon band. However, tuning the chemical
potential at a strong interaction regime may lead to spin density wave at
finite wave vectors. Then, focusing on the non-magnetic correlated phase and
using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate the appearance of a flat-band
induced sharp peak in the density of states in addition to the
correlation-induced Mott bands. Furthermore, the large seebeck coefficient and
the figure of merit of the proposed partially flat-band model, compared to
symmetric regular band models, put them in the category of efficient
thermoelectric materials.

<h3>Detecting the Néel vector of altermagnet by attaching a topological  insulator and crystalline valley-edge insulator</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09150</a>
<br>
</p><i>Motohiko Ezawa</i>
<p>In order to detect the N\'{e}el vector of an altermagnet, we investigate
topological phases in a bilayer system composed of an altermagnet and a
two-dimensional topological insulator described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang
model. A topological phase transition occurs from a first-order topological
insulator to a trivial insulator at a certain critical altermagnetization if
the N\'{e}el vector of altermagnet is along the $x$ axis or the $y$ axis. It is
intriguing that valley-protected edge states emerge along the N\'{e}el vector
in this trivial insulator, which are as stable as the topological edge states.
We name it a crystalline valley-edge insulator. On the other hand, the system
turns out to be a second-order topological insulator when the N\'{e}el vector
is along the $z$ axis. The tunneling conductance has a strong dependence on the
N\'{e}el vector. In addition, the band gap depends on the N\'{e}el vector,
which is measurable by optical absorption. Hence, it is possible experimentally
to detect the N\'{e}el vector by measuring tunneling conductance and optical
absorption.

<h3>An FFT based approach to account for elastic interactions in OkMC:  Application to dislocation loops in iron</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09158</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rodrigo Santos-Güemes, Christophe J. Ortiz, Javier Segurado</i>
<p>Object kinetic Montecarlo (OkMC) is a fundamental tool for modeling defect
evolution in volumes and times far beyond atomistic models. The elastic
interaction between defects is classically considered using a dipolar
approximation but this approach is limited to simple cases and can be
inaccurate for large and close interacting defects. In this work a novel
framework is proposed to include "exact" elastic interactions between defects
in OkMC valid for any type of defect and anisotropic media. In this method, the
elastic interaction energy of a defect is computed by volume integration of its
elastic strain multiplied by the stress created by all the other defects, being
both fields obtained numerically using a FFT solver. The resulting interaction
energies reproduce analytical elastic solutions and show the limited accuracy
of dipole approaches for close and large defects.
The OkMC framework proposed is used to simulate the evolution in space and
time of self-interstitial atoms and dislocation loops in iron. It is found that
including the anisotropy has a quantitative effect in the evolution of all the
type of defects studied. Regarding dislocation loops, it is observed that using
the "exact" interaction energy result in higher interactions than using the
dipole approximation for close loops.

<h3>Compactness of quantics tensor train representations of local  imaginary-time propagators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09161" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09161</a>
<br>
</p><i>Haruto Takahashi, Rihito Sakurai, Hiroshi Shinaoka</i>
<p>Space-time dependence of imaginary-time propagators, vital for \textit{ab
initio} and many-body calculations based on quantum field theories, has been
revealed to be compressible using Quantum Tensor Trains (QTTs) [Phys. Rev. X
{\bf 13}, 021015 (2023)]. However, the impact of system parameters, like
temperature, on data size remains underexplored. This paper provides a
comprehensive numerical analysis of the compactness of local imaginary-time
propagators in QTT for one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency
objects, considering truncation in terms of the Frobenius and maximum norms. We
employ random pole models to study worst-case scenarios. The numerical analysis
reveals several key findings. For one-time/-frequency objects and
two-time/-frequency objects, the bond dimensions saturate at low temperatures,
especially for truncation in terms of the Frobenius norm. We provide
counting-number arguments for the saturation of bond dimensions for the
one-time/-frequency objects, while the origin of this saturation for
two-time/-frequency objects remains to be clarified. This paper's findings
highlight the critical need for further research on the selection of truncation
methods, tolerance levels, and the choice between imaginary-time and
imaginary-frequency representations in practical applications.

<h3>Dynamics of Droplets Moving on Lubricated Polymer Brushes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09189" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09189</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rodrique G. M. Badr, Lukas Hauer, Doris Vollmer, Friederike Schmid</i>
<p>Understanding the dynamics of drops on polymer-coated surfaces is crucial for
optimizing applications such as self-cleaning materials or microfluidic
devices. While the static and dynamic properties of deposited drops have been
well characterised, a microscopic understanding of the underlying dynamics is
missing. In particular, it is unclear how drop dynamics depends on the amount
of uncrosslinked chains in the brush, because experimental techniques fail to
quantify those. Here we use coarse-grained simulations to study droplets moving
on a lubricated polymer brush substrate under the influence of an external body
force. The simulation model is based on the many body dissipative particle
dynamics (mDPD) method and designed to mimic a system of water droplets on
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes with chemically identical PDMS lubricant.
In agreement with experiments, we find a sublinear power law dependence between
the external force $F$ and the droplet velocity $v$, $F \propto v^\alpha$ with
$\alpha <1$; however, the exponents differ ($\alpha \sim 0.6-0.7$ in
simulations versus $\alpha \sim 0.25$ in experiments). With increasing
velocity, the droplets elongate and the receding contact angle decreases,
whereas the advancing contact angle remains roughly constant. Analyzing the
flow profiles inside the droplet reveals that the droplets do not slide, but
roll, with vanishing slip at the substrate surface. Surprisingly, adding
lubricant has very little effect on the effective friction force between the
droplet and the substrate, even though it has a pronounced effect on the size
and structure of the wetting ridge, especially above the cloaking transition.

<h3>A resistive electron irradiation microsensor made from conductive  electrospun polycaprolactone fibers loaded with carbon nanotubes and  fullerene C60</h3>

</p><i>Fabricio N. Molinari, Maria A. Mancuso, Emanuel Bilbao, Theo Rodriguez Campos, Gustavo Gimenez, Leandro N. Monsalve</i>
<p>In this work an electron radiation detector microdevices were fabricated and
characterized. The devices consisted of a conductive electrospun mat made of
polycaprolactone loaded with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and fullerene C60
deposited onto gold interdigitated microelectrodes. They were capable of
permanently increase their conductivity upon exposure to electron beam
irradiation from 0.02 pC/{\mu}m2 accelerated at 10 and 20 keV. This phenomenon
could be explained due to the ability of C60 to trap and stabilize negative
charges and thus contribute to the conductivity of the polymer composite. The
devices achieved their maximum conductivity at an irradiation between 0.22 and
0.27 pC/{\mu}m2 and this maximum was dependent of the electron acceleration.
Montecarlo simulations were performed to explain dependence as function of
electron penetration in the polymer composite. Moreover, the devices irradiated
at 20keV maintained their final conductivity and the devices irradiated at
10keV increased their final conductivity after 6 days from irradiation.
Fullerenes proved to act as highly efficient electron scavengers within the
polymer composite and contribute to its conductivity, and the microdevice has
potential application as beta radiation sensors.

<p>We report on an experimental simulation of the spin-1 Heisenberg model with
composite bosons in a one-dimensional chain based on the two-component
Bose-Hubbard model. Exploiting our site-and spin-resolved quantum gas
microscope, we observed faster superexchange dynamics of the spin-1 system
compared to its spin-1/2 counterpart, which is attributed to the enhancement
effect of multi-bosons. We further probed the non-equilibrium spin dynamics
driven by the superexchange and single-ion anisotropy terms, unveiling the
linear expansion of the spin-spin correlations, which is limited by the
Lieb-Robinson bound. Based on the superexchange process, we prepared and
verified the entangled qutrits pairs with these composite spin-1 bosons,
potentially being applied in qutrit-based quantum information processing.

<h3>Topological Optical Spin Injection Beyond Regular Weyl semimetals</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Suvendu Ghosh, Chuanchang Zeng, A. Taraphder, Snehasish Nandy</i>
<p>Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich
gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally
inaccessible via conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these
intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical spin injection} (OSI) beyond the
regular Weyl semimetal (WSM), specifically in multi- and higher-order WSMs.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that OSI in multi-WSMs can emerge as a
frequency-independent quantized response engendered by band linearity and
topological charge associated with the node. Interestingly, the frequency
independence can be destroyed by going beyond the first-order topological
phase. We show that the OSI response is accompanied by peaks for the
first-order Weyl nodes while dips for the second-order Weyl nodes. In addition,
we elucidate the behavior of OSI in type-II Weyl phases. The predicted
signatures of OSI beyond the regular WSM, i.e., multi- and higher-order WSM,
could be experimentally exploited, leading us to effectively access as well as
distinguish different-order nontrivial Weyl topology.

<h3>Quantum effects in the H-bond symmetrization and in the thermodynamic  properties of high pressure ice</h3>

</p><i>Marco Cherubini, Lorenzo Monacelli, Bingjia Yang, Roberto Car, Michele Casula, Francesco Mauri</i>
<p>We investigate the structural and thermodynamic properties of high-pressure
ice by incorporating quantum anharmonicity at a non-perturbative level. Quantum
fluctuations reduce the critical pressure of the phase transition between phase
VIII (with asymmetric H-bonds) and phase X (with symmetric H-bonds) by 65 GPa
from its classical value of 116 GPa at 0K. Moreover, quantum effects make it
temperature-independent over a wide temperature range (0K-300K), in agreement
with experimental estimates obtained through vibrational spectroscopy and in
striking contrast to the strong temperature dependence found in the classical
approximation. The equation of state shows fingerprints of the transition in
accordance with experimental evidence. Additionally, we demonstrate that,
within our approach, proton disorder in phase VII has a negligible impact on
the occurrence of phase X. Finally, we reproduce with high accuracy the 10 GPa
isotope shift due to the hydrogen-to-deuterium substitution.

</p><i>Jure Kokalj</i>
<p>The bad metallic phase with resistivity above the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit,
which appears also in cuprate superconductors, was recently understood by cold
atom and computer simulations of the Hubbard model via charge susceptibility
and charge diffusion constant. However, since reliable simulations can be
typically done only at temperatures above the experimental temperatures, the
question for cuprate superconductors is still open. This paper addresses this
question by resorting to heat transport, which allows for the estimate of
electronic diffusion and it further combines it with the resistivity to
estimate the charge susceptibility. The doping and temperature dependencies of
diffusion constant and charge susceptibilities are shown and discussed for two
samples of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Results indicate strongly incoherent
transport, mean free path corresponding to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit for the
underdoped sample at temperatures above ~200 K and significant effect of the
charge susceptibility on the resistivity.

<h3>A simple reconstruction method to infer nonreciprocal interactions and  local driving in complex systems</h3>

</p><i>Tim Hempel, Sarah A. M. Loos</i>
<p>Data-based inference of directed interactions in complex dynamical systems is
a problem common to many disciplines of science. In this work, we study
networks of spatially separate dynamical entities, which could represent
physical systems that interact with each other by reciprocal or nonreciprocal,
instantaneous or time-delayed interactions. We present a simple approach that
combines Markov state models with directed information-theoretical measures for
causal inference that can accurately infer the underlying interactions from
noisy time series of the dynamical system states alone. Remarkably, this is
possible despite the built-in simplification of a Markov assumption and the
choice of a very coarse discretization at the level of probability estimation.
Our test systems are an Ising chain with nonreciprocal coupling imposed by
local driving of a single spin, and a system of delay-coupled linear stochastic
processes. Stepping away from physical systems, the approach infers
cause-effect relationships, or more generally, the direction of mutual or
one-way influence. The presented method is agnostic to the number of
interacting entities and details of the dynamics, so that it is widely
applicable to problems in various fields.

<p>Rare-earth tritellurides are van-der-Waals antiferromagnets which have been
attracting attention as materials not onlywith high mobility, but also with
various states such as superconductivity under high pressure, incommensurate
charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, andmultiple antiferromagnetic phases.In this
work, we performed longitudinal resistivity and Hall resistivity measurements
simultaneously in exfoliated $R$Te$_3$ ($R=$La, Ce, Tb) thin film devices,in
order to investigate the influence of magnetic ordering on transport properties
in van-der-Waals magnetic materials.We have obtained carrier mobility and
concentration using a two-band model, and have observed an increase in carrier
mobility in the antiferromagnets CeTe$_3$ and TbTe$_3$ due to the magnetic
transition.Especially in CeTe$_3$, the carrier concentration has changed
drastically below the magnetic transition temperature,suggesting the
interaction between the CDW and antiferromagnetic phases.In addition, the
analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in CeTe$_3$ supports the
possibility of Fermi surface modulation by magnetic ordering.This research will
pave the way not only for spintronic devicesthat take advantage of high
mobility, but also for the study of the correlation between CDW and magnetism
states in low-dimensional materials.

<p>Conversion of charge to orbital angular momentum through the orbital Hall
effect (OHE) holds transformative potential for the development of
orbital-based electronics, however, it is challenging to directly observe the
electrically generated orbital accumulation. Here, we detect the OHE by
directly quantifying the orbital accumulation along the edges of a titanium
thin film using a scanning transmission electron microscope. We measure the Ti
L-edge using electron energy-loss spectroscopy with nanometer resolution and
find a sizable orbital accumulation at the sample's outer perimeters,
consistent with all signatures expected for the OHE, and determine an orbital
diffusion length $\ell_o \approx 7.3$ nm. Our data points to a surprising
dependence of the orbital diffusion length on the nano-structural morphology.

<p>Non-periodic folding of periodic crease patterns paves the way to novel
nonlinear phenomena that cannot be feasible through periodic folding. This
paper focuses on the non-periodic folding of recursive crease patterns
generalized from Spidron. Although it is known that Spidron has a 1-DOF
isotropic rigid folding motion, its general kinematics and dependence on the
crease pattern remain unclear. Using the kinematics of a single unit cell of
Spidron and the recursive construction of the folded state of multiple unit
cells, we consider the folding of Spidron that is not necessarily isotropic. We
found that as the number of unit cells increases, the non-periodic folding is
restricted and the isotropic folding becomes dominant. Then, we analyze the
three kinds of isotropic folding modes by constructing 1-dimensional dynamical
systems governing each of them. We show that the dynamical system can possess
different recursive natures depending on folding modes even in an identical
crease pattern. Furthermore, we show their novel nonlinear nature, including
the period-doubling cascade leading to the emergence of chaos.

<br>
</p><i>Artur L. Gower, Tom Shearer, Pasquale Ciarletta, Michel Destrade</i>
<p>A large variety of materials, widely encountered both in engineering
applications and in the biological realm, are characterised by a non-vanishing
internal stress distribution, even in the absence of external deformations or
applied forces. These initial stresses are due to initial strains or
microstructural changes, such as thermal expansion, manufacturing processes,
volumetric growth, remodelling, etc. A common constitutive choice for modelling
such materials extends the classical approach in the field theory of continuum
mechanics to include, explicitly, the initial stress or strain in the elastic
stored energy function. Here, we discuss why these energy functions need to
satisfy some restrictions to avoid unphysical behaviours, such as
non-conservation of energy, {and we derive the required restrictions from the
classical assumptions of elasticity.} To illustrate their need, we perform a
rigorous asymptotic expansion for proving that these restrictions on stored
energy functions that depend on the strain and initial stress are required for
consistency with strain energy functions of classical third-order weakly
nonlinear elasticity.

<p>The Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit sets the lower bound of carrier mean free path for
coherent quasiparticle transport. Metallicity beyond this limit is of great
interest because it is often closely related to quantum criticality and
unconventional superconductivity. Progress along this direction mainly focuses
on the strange-metal behaviors originating from the evolution of quasiparticle
scattering rate such as linear-in-temperature resistivity, while the
quasiparticle coherence phenomena in this regime are much less explored due to
the short mean free path at the diffusive bound. Here we report the observation
of quantum oscillations from Landau quantization near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel
limit in CaAs3. Despite the insulator-like temperature dependence of
resistivity, CaAs3 presents giant magnetoresistance and prominent Shubnikov-de
Haas oscillations from Fermi surfaces, indicating highly coherent band
transport. In contrast, the quantum oscillation is absent in the magnetic
torque. The quasiparticle effective mass increases systematically with magnetic
fields, manifesting a much larger value than the expectation given by
magneto-infrared spectroscopy. It suggests a strong many-body renormalization
effect near Fermi surface. We find that these unconventional behaviors may be
explained by the interplay between the mobility edge and the van Hove
singularity, which results in the formation of coherent cyclotron orbits
emerging at the diffusive bound. Our results call for further study on the
electron correlation effect of the van Hove singularity.

<p>We revisit the question of string order and hidden symmetry breaking in the
q-deformed AKLT model, an example of a spin chain that possesses generalized
symmetry. We first argue that the non-local Kennedy-Tasaki duality
transformation that was previously proposed to relate the string order to a
local order parameter leads to a non-local Hamiltonian and thus does not
provide a physically adequate description of the symmetry breaking. We then
present a modified non-local transformation which is based on a recently
developed generalization of Witten's Conjugation to frustration-free lattice
models and capable of resolving this issue.

</p><i>Vijay Ganesh Sadhasivam, Fumika Suzuki, Bin Yan, Nikolai A. Sinitsyn</i>
<p>Advances in ultracold chemistry have led to the possibility of a coherent
transformation between ultracold atoms and molecules including between
completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the
magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage
through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of
generic interaction between the formed molecules can fundamentally alter the
nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of
the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by
this rather general interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as
coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of
squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical
and numerical descriptions of these many-body effects, along with scaling laws
for the reaction yield in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes, and
highlight the potential experimental relevance in quantum sensing.

<h3>Onsager vortex clusters on a sphere</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jiawen Chen, Xiaoquan Yu</i>
<p>We study Onsager vortex clustered states in a shell-shaped superfluid
containing a large number of quantum vortices. In the incompressible limit and
at low temperatures, the relevant problem can be boiled down to the statistical
mechanics of neutral point vortices confined on a sphere. We analyze rotation
free vortex clustered states within the mean field theory in the microcanonical
ensemble. We find that the sandwich state, which involves the separating of
vortices with opposite circulation and the clustering of vortices with same
circulation around the poles and the equator, is the maximum entropy vortex
distribution, subject to zero angular momentum constraint. The dipole momentum
vanishes for the sandwich state and the quadrupole tensor serves as an order
parameter to characterize the vortex cluster structure. For given finite
angular momentum, the equilibrium vortex distribution forms a dipole structure,
i.e., vortices with opposite sign are separated and are accumulated around the
south and north pole, respectively. The conditions for the onset of clustering,
and the exponents associated with the quadrupole moment and the dipole moment
as functions of energy, are obtained within the mean field theory. At large
energies, we obtain asymptotically exact vortex density distributions using the
stereographic projection method, which give rise the parameter bounds for the
vortex clustered states. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement
with microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations.

</p><i>Jiating Yao, Benliang Zhou, Xiaoying Zhou, Xianbo Xiao, Guanghui Zhou</i>
<p>We theoretically study the quantum scattering and transport of electrons with
Mexican-hat dispersion through both step and rectangular potential barriers by
using the transfer matrix method. Owing to the torus-like iso-energy lines of
the Mexican-hat dispersion, we observe the presence of double reflections and
double transmissions in both two different barrier scenarios, i.e., the normal
reflection (NR), retro-reflection (RR), normal transmission (NT), and specular
transmission (ST).For the step potential with electrons incident from the large
wavevector, the transmission is primarily governed by NT with nearly negligible
ST, while the reflection is dominant by RR (NR) within (outside) the critical
angle. Additionally, for electrons incident from the small wavevector, the NT
can be reduced to zero by adjusting the barrier, resulting in a significant
enhancement of ST and RR. For the rectangular barrier, the transmission and
reflection spectra resemble those of the step barrier, but there are two kinds
of resonant tunneling which can lead to perfect NT or ST. There exists a
negative differential conductance (NDC) effect in the conductance spectrum. The
conductance and the peak-to-valley ratio of the NDC effect can be effectively
controlled by adjusting the height and width of the barrier as well as the
incident energy. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the electron
states governed by the Mexican-hat dispersion.

<h3>Magnetic distillation of intrinsic electric dipoles in mixed-stacking  tetralayer graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09354" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09354</a>
<br>
</p><i>Patrick Johansen Sarsfield, Aitor Garcia-Ruiz, Vladimir I. Fal'ko</i>
<p>Polytypes of tetralayer graphene (TLG: Bernal, rhombohedral and mixed
stacking) offer a choice of crystalline structures with different symmetries.
Among those, mixed-stacking tetralayers lack inversion symmetry, which allows
for intrinsic spontaneous out-of-plane electrical polarisation, inverted in the
mirror-image pair, ABCB and ABAC stackings. Here, we compare the intrinsic
polarisation with the symmetry-breaking effect of a substrate. We find that a
potential induced by the substrate on the bottom layer of the TLG can generate
out-of-plane electric dipole moments with different sizes in all four polytypes
and, also, different for the ABCB and ABAC pair. This undermines a
straightforward interpretation of experimentally measured Kelvin probe
microscopy maps of tetralayer flakes in terms of their intrinsic polarisation.
To overcome this difficulty, we analyse the influence of an external magnetic
field on electrical polarisation of all four TLGs and find that Landau level
quantisation highlights the intrinsic asymmetry of mixed stacking polytypes,
making the difference between ABCB and ABAC polarisations almost independent of
the substrate effect. We also notice a non-monotonic (hump-like) feature in the
polarisation in a magnetic field range of 0.5-3 Tesla, caused by the interplay
between time inversion symmetry breaking and spatial inversion symmetry
breaking specific for those two polytypes.

<h3>Noise-aware neural network for stochastic dynamics simulation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09370</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pei-Fang Wu, Wei-Chen Guo, Liang He</i>
<p>In the presence of system-environment coupling, classical complex systems
undergo stochastic dynamics, where rich phenomena can emerge at large
spatio-temporal scales. To investigate these phenomena, numerical approaches
for simulating stochastic dynamics are indispensable and can be computationally
expensive. In light of the recent fast development in machine learning
techniques, here, we establish a generic machine learning approach to simulate
the stochastic dynamics, dubbed the noise-aware neural network (NANN). One key
feature of this approach is its ability to generate the long-time stochastic
dynamics of complex large-scale systems by just training NANN with the one-step
dynamics of smaller-scale systems, thus reducing the computational cost.
Furthermore, this NANN based approach is quite generic. Case-by-case special
design of the architecture of NANN is not necessary when it is employed to
investigate different stochastic complex systems. Using the noisy Kuramoto
model and the Vicsek model as concrete examples, we demonstrate its capability
in simulating stochastic dynamics. We believe that this novel machine learning
approach can be a useful tool in investigating the large spatio-temporal
scaling behavior of complex systems subjected to the influences of the
environmental noise.

<h3>Discovery of a distinct collective mode in kagome superconductors</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Bin Hu, Hui Chen, Yuhan Ye, Zihao Huang, Xianghe Han, Zhen Zhao, Hongqin Xiao, Xiao Lin, Haitao Yang, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao</i>
<p>The collective modes of the superconducting (SC) order parameter fluctuation
can provide key insights into the nature of the superconductor, such as the
pairing symmetry and orbital nature of the cooper pairs. Their detection has
been challenging. Recently, a family of charge density wave (CDW)
superconductors has emerged in non-magnetic kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb,
Cs), exhibiting evidence for unprecedented time-reversal symmetry breaking CDW,
roton-pair density wave (PDW), and higher-charge flux quantization. However,
the collective behaviors of the cooper pairs have not been studied. Here, we
report a distinct collective mode in the kagome superconductors CsV3-xTaxSb5.
Using scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy (STM/S), we observe a
"peak-dip-hump" feature in the tunneling conductance-a defining signature of
collective excitations. The spectral lineshape is well-described by two SC gap
functions, one isotropic and one anisotropic, and a bosonic mode due to
electron-mode coupling. With increasing x, the two SC gaps, with different
pair-breaking strengths and thus different orbital/band characters, move closer
in energy, merge into two isotropic gaps of equal amplitude, and then increase
synchronously. The collective mode energy, on the other hand, decreases
monotonically to well below the quasi-particle excitation gap 2{\Delta} and
survives even after the CDW order is suppressed at large x. We identify the
collective mode as the Leggett mode of the relative phases between different SC
components in the multi-band superconductor or the exotic Bardasis-Schrieffer
mode due to a subleading SC component. Our findings provide valuable insights
on the nature of the SC ground state and collective excitations, their
evolution with Ta-substitutions, and offer a new pathway to study the origin of
superconductivity and its interplay with CDW order in kagome superconductors.

<h3>A device for studying elementary plasticity fluctuations in granular  media</h3>

<p>In this manuscript, we describe a scientific device specifically designed for
the study of the plasticity fluctuations preceding the fracture of granular
media. Biaxial tests on model granular media are performed using a commercial
uniaxial loading system. Strain field fluctuations are measured using a method
based on the interference of coherent light scattered by the sample. We show
that such a device enables discrete plasticity events to be unambiguously
evidenced. Moreover, those discrete plasticity fluctuations depend only on the
imposed strain, and not on the strain rate.

<p>Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have opened new opportunities to develop
atomically thin (opto)electronic devices with a wide range of functionalities.
The recent focus on manipulating the interlayer twist angle has led to the
observation of out-of-plane room temperature ferroelectricity in twisted
rhombohedral (R) bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Here we
explore the switching behaviour of sliding ferroelectricity using scanning
probe microscopy domain mapping and tunnelling transport measurements. We
observe well-pronounced ambipolar switching behaviour in ferroelectric
tunnelling junctions (FTJ) with composite ferroelectric/non-polar insulator
barriers and support our experimental results with complementary theoretical
modelling. Furthermore, we show that the switching behaviour is strongly
influenced by the underlying domain structure, allowing fabrication of diverse
FTJ devices with various functionalities. We show that to observe the
polarisation reversal, at least one partial dislocation must be present in the
device area. This behaviour is drastically different from that of conventional
ferroelectric materials and its understanding is an important milestone for
future development of optoelectronic devices based on sliding ferroelectricity.

<h3>Comparative Microscopic Study of Entropies and their Production</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09403" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09403</a>
<br>
</p><i>Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler</i>
<p>We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of
Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational,
entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions
(based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the
archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here
with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger
equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy
eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three
classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative
temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic
dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the
microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C,
Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated
temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies
can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless.
(5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar
random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or
identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.

<h3>Inelastic neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation investigations of  the deuterated Kondo lattices CeNiSnD$ _x $</h3>

<p>CeNiSn is a Kondo semimetal where a gap opens at low temperatures due to
hybridization between 4$f$ and conduction electrons, but a full insulating
state fails to develop. Upon the insertion of hydrogen, long range magnetic
order is induced. Here we report zero-field muon-spin relaxation and inelastic
neutron scattering measurements of polycrystalline samples of the deuterides
CeNiSnD$_x$ ($x$=1.0, 1.8). The muon-spin relaxation results confirm magnetic
ordering in the whole sample of CeNiSnD below around 4.7 K, while inelastic
neutron scattering reveals two well-defined crystalline-electric field (CEF)
excitations at around 13 meV and 34 meV in CeNiSnD, and 5 meV and 27 meV for
CeNiSnD$_{1.8}$. These results suggest that hydrogenation leads to the
localization of the Ce-4$f$ electrons, giving rise to long-range magnetic
order. We propose CEF level schemes for both systems, which predict a ground
state moment of 0.96$\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce within the $ab$-plane for CeNiSnD$_{1.8}$
and a saturated moment of 1.26$\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce along the easy $c$ axis for
CeNiSnD, that account for the observed magnetic properties.

<h3>Low-coercive-field ferroelectric hafnia with mobile domain walls</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09426" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09426</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jing Wu, Jiyuan Yang, Yang Sun, Shi Liu</i>
<p>The high coercive field ($\mathcal{E}_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics
presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching
mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $\mathcal{E}_c$, especially those related to
nucleation-and-growth at the domain wall (DW), have remained elusive. Through
deep-learning-assisted multiscale simulations, we determine the
finite-temperature thermodynamics and switching mechanisms for diverse types of
180$^\circ$ DWs, revealing a complex, stress-sensitive mobility landscape. The
propagation velocities for mobile DW types under various thermal conditions can
be characterized with a single creep equation, featuring a creep exponent of 2.
This unconventional critical exponent results from the nucleation of a
half-unit-cell-thin, elliptically-shaped critical nucleus. Our multiscale
approach not only reproduces the experimental thickness ($d$) scaling,
$\mathcal{E}_c\propto d^{-\frac{2}{3}}$, but also predicts that $\mathcal{E}_c$
of HfO$_2$ can be engineered to $\approx$0.1 MV/cm, even lower than perovskite
ferroelectrics. The theoretical lower bound of $\mathcal{E}_c$ afforded by
ferroelectric hafnia offers opportunities to realize power-efficient,
high-fidelity ferroelectric nanoelectronics.

<p>Centrosymmetric GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ exhibits a variety of multi-Q magnetic states
as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field, including a square
skyrmion-lattice phase. The material's behavior is strongly dependent on the
direction of the applied field, with different phase diagrams resulting for
fields applied parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$ axis.
Here, we present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) measurements
on single crystals of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our analysis is based on the computation
of muon stopping sites and consideration of zero-point motion effects, allowing
direct comparison with the underlying spin textures in the material. Using
transverse-field $\mu^+$SR with fields applied along either the [001] or [100]
crystallographic directions, we distinguish between the magnetic phases in this
system via their distinct muon response, providing additional evidence for the
skyrmion and meron-lattice phases, while also suggesting the existence of
RKKY-driven muon hyperfine coupling. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR provides clear
evidence for a transition between two distinct magnetically-ordered phases at
39 K.

<h3>Exact matrix product state representations for a type of scale-invariant  states</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch</i>
<p>Exact matrix product state representations for a type of scale-invariant
states are presented, which describe highly degenerate ground states arising
from spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in
one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. As a possible application, such a
representation offers a convenient but powerful means for evaluating the norms
of highly degenerate ground states. This in turn allows us to perform a
universal finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy.
Moreover, this approach vividly explains why the entanglement entropy does not
depend on what types of the boundary conditions are adopted, either periodic
boundary conditions or open boundary conditions. Illustrative examples include
the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$s$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model, the ${\rm SU}(2s+1)$
ferromagnetic model, and the staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ spin-1 ferromagnetic
biquadratic model.

<p>The cubic $C$15 CaAl$_2$ Laves phase is a crucial brittle intermetallic
precipitate in Mg-Al-Ca alloys. Although knowledge of the mechanical properties
of coexisting phases is essential for improved alloy design, the fracture
toughness is not yet studied experimentally due to the need for miniaturised
testing. Here, micropillar splitting and microcantilever bending are used to
experimentally determine the toughness of CaAl$_2$. It is found that the
toughness value of ~1 $MPa\cdot\sqrt m$ from pillar splitting is largely
insensitive to sample heat treatment, ion beam used for fabrication,
micropillar diameter, and surface orientation. From nanoindentation supported
by electron channelling contrast imaging and backscatter diffraction, fracture
is observed to take place mostly on {011} planes. Atomistic fracture
simulations on a model $C$15 Laves phase showed that the preference of {011}
cleavage planes over the more energetically favourable {111} is due to lattice
trapping and kinetics controlling fracture. Using rectangular microcantilever
bending tests where the notch plane was misoriented to the closest possible
{112} cleavage plane by ~8{\deg}, and the closest {001}, {011} and {111} plane
by >20{\deg}, a toughness of ca. 2 $MPa\cdot\sqrt m$ was determined along with
the electron microscopy observation of significant deviations of the crack
path, demonstrating that preferential crystallographic cleavage planes
determine the toughness in this material. Further investigation using
pentagonal microcantilevers with precise alignment of the notch with the
cleavage planes revealed similar fracture toughness values for different
low-index planes. The results presented here are the first detailed
experimental study of fracture toughness of the $C$15 CaAl$_2$ Laves phase, and
can be understood in terms of crack plane and crack front dependent fracture
toughness.

<p>In this short article, we overview a concept of electronic toroidal
multipoles, and their ordering with associated physical properties in
non-magnetic and magnetic materials. The toroidal multipoles are introduced as
microscopic electronic variables in view of symmetry and connection to Dirac
theory. They are classified according to crystallographic and magnetic point
groups, which allows us to discuss various possible cross correlations in a
transparent and unified manner. The representative examples of toroidal orders
and related phenomena, and the mutual relationship between these orders are
given, with focusing on monopoles and dipoles. The concept of toroidal
multipoles would promote future studies toward observations and identifications
of unknown electronic phases and their related physical phenomena.

<p>Altermagnetism combines aspects of both ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism, breaking spin degeneracy while possessing no net
magnetization. In this work, we study the symmetry requirements for
topologically protected Weyl points in 2D altermagnets, involving bands with
the same spin quantum number. We classify all spin-wallpaper groups whose
symmetries protect 2D Weyl points and show that their nontrivial topology is
charactrized by a quantized $\pi$-Berry phase. Representative electronic
tight-binding and magnonic linear spin-wave models are constructed to
investigate the unusual transport characteristics of these 2D Weyl points.
Different mass terms, induced for example through strain or via coupling to
light or a substrate, gap out the Weyl points leading to emerging gapped
topological phases. Depending on the mass terms, these phases carry finite
Chern and/or spin Chern numbers and exhibit protected edge states as well as
anomalous electronic and thermal Hall responses. We calculate these Hall
currents for the different topological phases.

<p>The need for structuring on micrometer scales is abundant, for example, in
view of phononic applications. We here outline a novel approach based on the
phenomenon of active turbulence on the mesoscale. As we demonstrate, a
shear-thickening carrier fluid of active microswimmers intrinsically stabilizes
regular vortex patterns of otherwise turbulent active suspensions. The fluid
self-organizes into a periodically structured nonequilibrium state. Introducing
additional passive particles of intermediate size leads to regular spatial
organization of these objects. Our approach opens a new path towards
functionalization through patterning of thin films and membranes.

</p><i>Zhiqiang Zhao, Wanlin Guo, Zhuhua Zhang</i>
<p>High Nb-containing TiAl alloys exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength
and room-temperature ductility, making them widely used in hot-section
components of automotive and aerospace engines. However, the lack of accurate
interatomic interaction potentials for large-scale modeling severely hampers a
comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism of Ti-Al-Nb alloys and the
development of strategies to enhance the mechanical properties. Here, we
develop a general-purpose machine-learned potential (MLP) for the Ti-Al-Nb
ternary system by combining the neural evolution potentials framework with an
active learning scheme. The developed MLP, trained on extensive
first-principles datasets, demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting
various lattice and defect properties, as well as high-temperature
characteristics such as thermal expansion and melting point for TiAl systems.
Notably, this potential can effectively describe the key effect of Nb doping on
stacking fault energies and formation energies. Of practical importance is that
our MLP enables large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving tens of
millions of atoms with ab initio accuracy, achieving an outstanding balance
between computational speed and accuracy. These results pave the way for
studying micro-mechanical behaviors in TiAl lamellar structures and developing
high-performance TiAl alloys towards applications at elevated temperatures.

<br>
</p><i>Akihiro Ozawa, Yasufumi Araki, Kentaro Nomura</i>
<p>Modulation of magnetization in magnetic Weyl semimetals leads to the shift of
Weyl points in momentum space, which effectively serves as the
chirality-dependent gauge field for the Weyl fermions. Here, we theoretically
study such a magnetization-induced chiral gauge field, in a fully
spin-polarized Weyl ferromagnet $\rm{Co}_3\rm{Sn}_2\rm{S}_2$. From a
tight-binding model of $\rm{Co}_3\rm{Sn}_2\rm{S}_2$ on stacked kagome lattice
with magnetism, we calculate the magnetization-dependent evolution of the Weyl
points in momentum space, resulting in the chiral gauge field. In the presence
of the magnetic domain wall structure, we evaluate the chiral magnetic field
arising from the spatial profile of the chiral gauge field. We find that a
magnetic domain wall in $\rm{Co}_3\rm{Sn}_2\rm{S}_2$ gives rise to a giant
chiral magnetic field for the Weyl fermions, which reaches the order of a few
hundred tesla to induce the Landau quantization. Such a giant chiral magnetic
field may also influence the novel transport phenomena, such as the charge
pumping by the domain wall motion, compatible with the spin-motive force.

<p>This paper introduces the HEX (High-pressure Elemental Xstals) database, a
complete database of the ground-state crystal structures of the first 57
elements of the periodic table, from H to La, at 0, 100, 200 and 300 GPa. HEX
aims to provide a unified reference for high-pressure research, by compiling
all available experimental information on elements at high pressure, and
complementing it with the results of accurate evolutionary crystal structure
prediction runs based on Density Functional Theory. Besides offering a
much-needed reference, our work also serves as a benchmark of the accuracy of
current ab-initio methods for crystal structure prediction. We find that, in 98
% of the cases in which experimental information is available, ab-initio
crystal structure prediction yields structures which either coincide or are
degenerate in enthalpy to within 300 K with experimental ones. The main
manuscript contains synthetic tables and figures, while the Crystallographic

<h3>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jian-Song Hong, Su-Qi Zhang, Xin Liu, Xiong-Jun Liu</i>
<p>Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic
non-Abelian statistics and potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum
computation. Although the prior research has predominantly focused on
non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent
progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring about
a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work,
we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which
host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental
results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that
protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the
PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own
parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into
separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the
parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective
braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA
statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a
tri-junction. In addition, we propose a physical model that accommodates a pair
of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This
work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting
fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental
quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.

<h3>Interaction-Driven Instabilities in the Random-Field XXZ Chain</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jeanne Colbois, Fabien Alet, Nicolas Laflorencie</i>
<p>Despite enormous efforts devoted to the study of the many-body localization
(MBL) phenomenon, the nature of the high-energy behavior of the Heisenberg spin
chain in a strong random magnetic field is lacking consensus. Here, we take a
step back by exploring the weak interaction limit starting from the Anderson
localized (AL) insulator. Through shift-invert diagonalization, we find that
below a certain disorder threshold $h^*$, weak interactions necessarily lead to
ergodic instability, whereas at strong disorder the AL insulator directly turns
into MBL. This agrees with a simple interpretation of the avalanche theory for
restoration of ergodicity. We further map the phase diagram for the generic XXZ
model in the disorder $h$ -- interaction $\Delta$ plane. Taking advantage of
the total magnetization conservation, our results unveil the remarkable
behavior of the spin-spin correlation functions: in the regime indicated as MBL
by standard observables, their exponential decay undergoes a unique inversion
of orientation $\xi_z>\xi_x$. We find that the longitudinal length $\xi_z$ is a
key quantity for capturing ergodic instabilities, as it increases with system
size near the thermal phase, in sharp contrast to its transverse counterpart
$\xi_x$.

<h3>Generative reconstruction of 3D volume elements for Ti-6Al-4V  basketweave microstructure by optimization of CNN-based microstructural  descriptors</h3>

</p><i>Vincent Blümer, Celal Soyarslan, Ton van den Boogaard</i>
<p>We present a methodology for the generative reconstruction of 3D Volume
Elements (VE) for numerical multiscale analysis of Ti-6Al-4V processed by
Additive Manufacturing (AM). The basketweave morphology, which is typically
dominant in AM-processed Ti-6Al-4V, is analyzed in conventional Electron
Backscatter Diffusion (EBSD) micrographs. Prior \b{eta}-grain reconstruction is
performed to obtain the out-of-plane orientation of the observed grains
leveraging Burgers orientation relationship. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- based microstructure descriptors are extracted from the 2D data, and used for
cross-section-based optimization of pixel values on orthogonal planes in 3D,
using the Microstructure Characterization and Reconstruction (MCR)
implementation MCRpy [16]. In order to utilize MCRpy, which performs best for
binary systems, the basketweave microstructure, which consists of up to twelve
distinct grain orientations, is decomposed into several separate two-phase
systems. Our reconstructions capture key characteristics of the titanium
basketweave morphology and show qualitative resemblance to experimentally
obtained 3D data. The preservation of volume fraction during assembly of the
reconstruction remains an unadressed challenge at this stage.
