<h3>Motor crosslinking augments elasticity in active nematics</h3>

In active materials, uncoordinated internal stresses lead to emergent
long-range flows. An understanding of how the behavior of active materials
depends on mesoscopic (hydrodynamic) parameters is developing, but there
remains a gap in knowledge concerning how hydrodynamic parameters depend on the
properties of microscopic elements. In this work, we combine experiments and
multiscale modeling to relate the structure and dynamics of active nematics
composed of biopolymer filaments and molecular motors to their microscopic
properties, in particular motor processivity, speed, and valency. We show that
crosslinking of filaments by both motors and passive crosslinkers not only
augments the contributions to nematic elasticity from excluded volume effects
but dominates them. By altering motor kinetics we show that a competition
between motor speed and crosslinking results in a nonmonotonic dependence of
nematic flow on motor speed. By modulating passive filament crosslinking we
show that energy transfer into nematic flow is in large part dictated by
crosslinking. Thus motor proteins both generate activity and contribute to
nematic elasticity. Our results provide new insights for rationally engineering
active materials.

<h3>Finsler Geometry Modeling and Monte Carlo Study on Geometrically  Confined skyrmions in Nanodots</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using the Finsler geometry modeling (FG) technique without spontaneous
magnetic anisotropy, we numerically study the stability and morphology of
geometrically confined skyrmions (skys) experimentally observed in nanodots. We
find a confinement effect that stabilizes skys for a low external magnetic
field without mechanical stresses by decreasing the diameter of the cylindrical
lattice and strain effects that cause the sky and vortex to emerge under the
zero magnetic field. Moreover, the obtained MC data on the morphological
changes are also consistent with the reported experimental data.

<h3>Eigenstate Thermalization in 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16202" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16202</a>
<br>
<i>Lukas Ebner, Berndt Müller, Andreas Schäfer, Clemens Seidl, Xiaojun Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
We present preliminary numerical evidence for the hypothesis that the
Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory discretized on a lattice obeys the Eigenstate
Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). To do so we study three approximations: (a) a
linear plaquette chain in a reduced Hilbert space limiting the electric field
basis to $j=0,\frac{1}{2}$ , (b) a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with
periodic or closed boundary condition and the same Hilbert space constraint,
and (c) a chain of only three plaquettes but such a sufficiently large electric
field Hilbert space ($j \leq \frac{7}{2})$ that convergence of all energy
eigenvalues in the analyzed energy window is observed. While an unconstrained
Hilbert space is required to reach the continuum limit of SU(2) gauge theory,
numerical resource constraints do not permit us to realize this requirement for
all values of the coupling constant and large lattices. In each of the three
studied cases we check first for RMT behavior and then analyse the diagonal as
well as the off-diagonal matrix elements between energy eigenstates for a few
operators. Within current uncertainties all results for (b) and (c) agree with
ETH predictions while for case (a) deviations are found to be large for one of
the analyzed observables. To unambiguously establish ETH behavior and determine
for which class of operators it applies, an extension of our investigations is
necessary.

<h3>Innovative insights into which statements the third law of  thermodynamics includes exactly</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16206" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16206</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaohang Chen, Yinghui Zhou, Jincan Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
It is found from textbooks and literature that the third law of
thermodynamics has three different statements, i.e., the Nernst theorem,
unattainability statement of absolute zero temperature, and heat capacity
statement. It is pointed out that such three statements correspond to three
thermodynamic parameters, which are, respectively, the entropy, temperature,
and heat capacity, and can be obtained by extrapolating the experimental
results of different parameters at ultra-low temperatures to absolute zero. It
is expounded that because there's no need for additional assumptions in the
derivation of the Nernst equation, the Nernst theorem should be renamed as the
Nernst statement. Moreover, it is proved that both the Nernst statement and the
heat capacity statement are mutually deducible and equivalent, while the
unattainability of absolute zero temperature is only a corollary of the Nernst
statement or the heat capacity statement so that it is unsuitably referred to
as one statement of the third law of thermodynamics. The conclusion is that the
Nernst statement and the heat capacity statement are two equivalent statements
of the third law of thermodynamics.

<h3>On the impossibility of isothermal heat transfer and its implications  for thermal physics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16213</a>
<br>
<i>A. Paglietti</i>
<br>
<br>
The physical impossibility of heat transfer under isothermal conditions
implies that the classical expression for the entropy of the ideal gas may not
be compatible with the internal energy of the gas itself. A corrected
expression of the ideal gas entropy is derived here. It is independent on
volume. This result is shown to be at a variance with the statistical
interpretations of entropy as a quantity that is related to the number of
microstates compatible with the macroscopic state of the system. It also offers
a better understanding of the thermodynamic notion of entropy. The present
analysis also establishes a general equation that links the entropy of a system
to its internal energy.

<h3>Thermodynamics and fractal dynamics of nematic spin ice, a doubly  frustrated pyrochlore Ising magnet</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonathan N. Hallén, Claudio Castelnovo, Roderich Moessner</i>
<br>
<br>
The Ising antiferromagnets on the triangular and on the pyrochlore lattices
are two of the most iconic examples of magnetic frustration, paradigmatically
illustrating many exotic properties such as emergent gauge fields,
fractionalisation, and topological order. In this work, we show that the two
instances of frustration can, remarkably, be combined in a single system, where
they coexist without inducing conventional long range ordering. We show that
the system undergoes a first order phase transition upon lowering the
temperature, into a yet different frustrated phase that we characterise to
exhibit nematic order. We argue that an extensive degeneracy survives down to
zero temperature, at odds with a customary Pauling estimate. Dynamically, we
find evidence of anomalous noise in the power spectral density, arising from an
effectively anisotropic fractal motion of monopoles at low temperature.

<h3>Filling constraints on translation invariant dipole conserving systems</h3>

Systems with conserved dipole moment have drawn considerable interest in
light of their realization in recent experiments on tilted optical lattices. An
important question for such systems is delineating the conditions under which
they admit a unique gapped ground state that is consistent with all symmetries.
Here, we study one-dimensional translation-invariant lattices that conserve
U(1) charge and $\mathbb{Z}_L$ dipole moment, where discreteness of the dipole
symmetry is enforced by periodic boundary conditions, with $L$ the system size.
We show that in these systems, a symmetric, gapped, and non-degenerate ground
state requires not only integer charge filling, but also a fixed value of the
dipole filling, while other fractional dipole fillings enforce either a gapless
or symmetry-breaking ground state. In contrast with prior results in the
literature, we find that the dipole filling constraint depends both on the
charge filling as well as the system size, emphasizing the subtle interplay of
dipole symmetry with boundary conditions. We support our results with numerical
simulations and exact results.

<h3>Local noise spectroscopy of Wigner crystals in two-dimensional materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16243" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16243</a>
<br>
<i>Pavel E. Dolgirev, Ilya Esterlis, Alexander A. Zibrov, Mikhail D. Lukin, Thierry Giamarchi, Eugene Demler</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose to use local electromagnetic noise spectroscopy as a versatile and
noninvasive tool to study Wigner crystal phases of strongly-interacting
two-dimensional electronic systems. In-plane imaging of the local noise is
predicted to enable single-site resolution of the electron crystal when the
sample-probe distance is less than the inter-electron separation. At larger
sample-probe distances, noise spectroscopy encodes information about the
low-energy Wigner crystal phonons, including the dispersion of the transverse
shear mode, the pinning resonance due to disorder, and optical modes emerging,
for instance, in bilayer crystals. We discuss the potential utility of local
noise probes in analyzing the rich set of phenomena expected to occur in the
vicinity of the melting transition.

<h3>A random free-fermion quantum spin chain with multi-spin interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16249" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16249</a>
<br>
<i>Francisco C. Alcaraz, José A. Hoyos, Rodrigo A. Pimenta</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of quenched disorder in a class of quantum chains with
(p + 1)-multi-spin interactions exhibiting a free fermionic spectrum, paying
special attention to the case p = 2. Depending if disorder couples to (i) all
the couplings or just to (ii) some of them, we have two distinct physical
scenarios. In case (i), we find that the transitions of the model are governed
by a universal infinite-randomness critical point surrounded by quantum
Griffiths phases similarly as happens to the random transverse-field Ising
chain. In case (ii), we find that quenched disorder becomes an irrelevant
perturbation: the clean critical behavior is stable and Griffiths phases are
absent. Beyond the perturbative regime, disorder stabilizes a line of
finite-randomness critical points (with non-universal critical exponents), that
ends in a multi-critical point of infinite-randomness type. In that case,
quantum Griffiths phases also appear surrounding the finite-disorder transition
point. We have characterized the correlation functions and the low-temperature
thermodynamics of these chains. Our results are derived from a strong-disorder
renormalization-group technique and from finite-size scaling analysis of the
spectral gap computed exactly (up to sizes $\sim 10^7$) via an efficient new
numerical method recently introduced in the literature [Alcaraz et al., Phys.
Rev. B 104, 174206 (2021)].

<h3>Collective Dynamics and Defect Generation for Wigner Crystal Ratchets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16286" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16286</a>
<br>
<i>C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a two-dimensional Wigner crystal coupled to a
quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric potential under ac or dc driving. As a
function of electron density, substrate strength, and ac amplitude, we find
that the system exhibits ordered and disordered pinned and dynamical states.
Ratchet effects can appear under an applied ac drive and can be associated with
pronounced structural changes from a disordered state to a one-dimensional
smectic-like state. We observe a pinned phase, a diode-like ratchet where
motion only occurs along the easy direction of the substrate asymmetry, a
plastic ratchet where motion occurs in both directions but there is only a net
drift in the easy direction, and an elastic ratchet where the system forms a
crystal without plastic deformation that can still undergo ratcheting. At high
filling, we find that there can be a ratchet reversal in which the net drift is
along the hard direction of the substrate asymmetry. For weak disorder, there
is an Aubry transition to a floating phase where the ratchet effects are lost.
We map out the different dynamical phases as a function of substrate strength,
filling, ac amplitude, and ac frequency. The ratchet effect on strong
substrates is enhanced by thermal fluctuations, but is destroyed when the
fluctuations become too large. Based on our results, we suggest new ways to
detect Wigner crystals as well as methods for creating new types of devices to
control disordered charge flow.

<h3>Ultrafast Field-driven Valley Polarization of Transition Metal  Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16315" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16315</a>
<br>
<i>Aranyo Mitra, Ahmal Jawad Zafar, Vadym Apalkov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study theoretically the electron dynamics of transition metal
dichalcogenide quantum dots in the field of an ultrashort and ultrafast
circularly polarized optical pulse. The quantum dots have the shape of a disk
and their electron systems are described within an effective model with
infinite mass boundary conditions. Similar to transition metal dichalcogenide
monolayers, a circularly polarized pulse generates ultrafast valley
polarization of such quantum dots. The dependence of the valley polarization on
the size of the dot is sensitive to the dot material and, for different
materials, show both monotonic increase with the dot radius and nonmonotonic
behavior with a local maximum at a finite dot radius.

<h3>Charge Asymmetry Suppresses Coarsening Dynamics in Polyelectrolyte  Complex Coacervation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16334" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16334</a>
<br>
<i>Shensheng Chen, Zhen-Gang Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Mixing solutions of oppositely charged macromolecules can result in
liquid-liquid phase separation into a polymer-rich coacervate phase and a
polymer-poor supernatant phase. Here we show that charge asymmetry in the
constituent polymers can slow down the coarsening dynamics, with an apparent
growth exponent that deviates from the well-known 1/3 for neutral systems and
decreases with increasing degrees of charge asymmetry. Decreasing solvent
quality accelerates the coarsening dynamics for asymmetric mixtures, but slows
down the coarsening dynamics for symmetric mixtures. We rationalize these
results by examining the interaction potential between merging droplets.

<h3>Formation of random singlets in the nanocrystalline  quasi-one-dimensional spin-1-2 antiferromagnet Sr21Bi8Cu2(CO3)2O41</h3>

<br>
<br>
Induced by quenched disorder, random-singlet states occur in a variety of
low-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnets, some of them candidates for quantum
spin liquids. Here we report measurements of the specific heat, magnetization,
and magnetic susceptibility of nanocrystalline Sr21Bi8Cu2(CO3)2O41, a
quasi-one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating bonds. The
results uncover the predominant presence of random-singlet spin pairs in this
material, with a logarithmic probability distribution, P(J), of the
renormalized, emergent exchange interaction, J, in zero magnetic field and P(J)
proportional to 1/J in magnetic fields. We postulate that these unexpected J
dependences, in contrast to the usual P(J) \propto 1/J^{\gamma} with 0 <
{\gamma} < 1, and possibly also the dichotomy, arise from the finite size of
the nanocrystals. Scaling functions for the specific heat and magnetization
reproduce our magnetocaloric-effect data, with no adjustable parameters.

<h3>Anomalous and ultraslow diffusion of a particle driven by  power-law-correlated and distributed-order noises</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16348</a>
<br>
<i>Z. Tomovski, K. Gorska, T. Pietrzak, R. Metzler, T. Sandev</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the generalized Langevin equation approach to anomalous diffusion
for a harmonic oscillator and a free particle driven by different forms of
internal noises, such as power-law-correlated and distributed-order noises that
fulfil generalized versions of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The mean
squared displacement and the normalized displacement correlation function are
derived for the different forms of the friction memory kernel. The
corresponding overdamped generalized Langevin equations for these cases are
also investigated. It is shown that such models can be used to describe
anomalous diffusion in complex media, giving rise to subdiffusion,
superdiffusion, ultraslow diffusion, strong anomaly, and other complex
diffusive behaviors.

<h3>General Formula for the Green's Function Approach to the Spin-1/2  Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16407" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16407</a>
<br>
<i>Daiki Sasamoto, Takao Morinari</i>
<br>
<br>
A wide range of analytical and numerical methods are available to study
quantum spin systems. However, the complexity of spin correlations and
interactions limits their applicability to specific temperature ranges. The
analytical approach utilizing Green's function has proved advantageous, as it
allows for formulation without restrictions on the presence of long-range order
and facilitates estimation of the spin excitation spectrum and thermodynamic
quantities across the entire temperature range. In this work, we present a
generalized formulation of the Green's function method that can be applied to
diverse spin systems. As specific applications, we consider the hypercubic
lattice and the $J_1$-$J_2$ model. For the cubic lattice case, the Green's
function approach provides a good estimation for the transition temperature.
Regarding the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, we include nematic correlations in the
analysis and find no signature of such correlations, though accurate numerical
calculations are required in the presence of strong frustration. Although our
focus is on the spin one-half antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on an
arbitrary lattice, the Green's function approach can be generalized to
incorporate other interactions and higher spin values.

<i>B. T. E. Ripley, D. Baillie, P. B. Blakie</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the crystalline stationary states of a dipolar Bose-Einstein
condensate in a planar trapping geometry. Our focus is on the ground state
phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit, where triangular, honeycomb and
stripe phases occur. We quantify the superfluid fraction by calculating the
non-classical translational inertia, which allows us to identify favorable
parameter regimes for observing supersolid ground states. We develop two
simplified theories to approximately describe the ground states, and consider
the relationship to roton softening in the uniform ground state. This also
allows us to extend the phase diagram to the low density regime. While the
triangular and honeycomb states have an isotropic superfluid response tensor,
the stripe state exhibits anisotropic superfluidity.

Hydrogen-rich materials offer a compelling avenue towards room temperature
superconductivity, albeit under ultra-high pressure. However, the high-pressure
environment imposes formidable constraints to investigate the electronic band
structure. Even under ambient pressure, the research remains elusive, due to
the inherent instability of most of the hydrogen-rich materials upon pressure
release. Very recently, high temperature superconductivity has been reported in
pressurized lutetium hydrides (~71 K) and nitrogen doped lutetium hydride (~294
K), with the later under debate. Upon decompression, nitrogen doped lutetium
hydride manifests a stable metallic phase with dark blue color. This
transformation engenders an unprecedented opportunity, allowing for the
experimental investigation of the electronic band structure intrinsic to
hydrogen-rich material. In this work, using angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy to investigate the nitrogen doped lutetium hydride, we observed
significant flat band and a Van Hove singularity marginally below the Fermi
level. These salient features, identified as critical elements, proffer
potential amplifiers for the realization of heightened superconductivity,
potentially extending to room temperature, as evidenced by prior research. Our
results not only unveil a confluence of potent strong correlation effects and
anisotropy within the Lu-H-N compound, but also provide a prospect for
engineering high temperature superconductivity through the strategic
manipulation of flat band and the VHS, effectively tailoring their alignment
with the Fermi energy.

Open many body quantum systems play a paramount role in various branches of
physics, such as quantum information, nonlinear optics or condensed matter. The
dissipative character of open systems has gained a lot of interest especially
within the fields of quantum optics, due to unprecedented stabilization of
quantum coherence, and quantum information, with its desire to control
environmental degrees of freedom. We look beyond the typical mechanism of
dissipation associated with an external source and show that strongly
interacting many particle systems can create quantum decoherence within
themselves. We study a quantum bosonic two-dimensional many body system with
extended interactions between particles. Analytical calculations show that the
system can be driven out of its coherent state, which is prevalent among
commonly used setups. However, we also observe a revival of the superfluid
phase within the same framework for sufficiently large interaction strength.
The breakdown of quantum coherence is inevitable, but can be misinterpreted if
one assumes improper coupling between the constituents of the many particle
system. We show an adequate path to retrieve physically relevant results and
consider its limitations. The system displays a natural cutoff that enforces
the breakdown of superfluidity.

<h3>Localizing Transitions via Interaction-Induced Flat Bands</h3>

This paper presents a theory of interaction-induced band-flattening in
strongly correlated electron systems. We begin by illustrating an inherent
connection between flat bands and index theorems, and presenting a generic
prescription for constructing flat bands by periodically repeating local
Hamiltonians with topological zero modes. Specifically, we demonstrate that a
Dirac particle in an external, spatially periodic magnetic field can be cast in
this form. We derive a condition on the field to produce perfectly flat bands
and provide an exact analytical solution for the flat band wave functions.
Furthermore, we explore an interacting model of Dirac fermions in a spatially
inhomogeneous field. We show that certain Hubbard-Stratonovich configurations
exist that ``rectify'' the field configuration, inducing band flattening. We
present an explicit model where this localization scenario is energetically
favorable -- specifically in Dirac systems with nearly flat bands, where the
energy cost of rectifying textures is quadratic in the order parameter, whereas
the energy gain from flattening is linear. In conclusion, we discuss
alternative symmetry-breaking channels, especially superconductivity, and
propose that these interaction-induced band-flattening scenarios represent a
generic non-perturbative mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking, pertinent
to many strongly-correlated electron systems.

Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing
thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling
applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc
topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less
explored. In this work, we systematically examine thermoelectric transport in a
series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films grown by molecular beam
epitaxy. Surprisingly, we find significantly enhanced Seebeck effect and
anomalous Nernst effect at cryogenic temperatures when the Cd3As2 layer is
thin. Combining angle-dependent quantum oscillation analysis,
magnetothermoelectric measurement, transport modelling and first-principles
simulation, we isolate the contributions from bulk and surface conducting
channels and attribute the unusual thermoeletric properties to the topological
surface states. Our analysis showcases the rich thermoelectric transport
physics in quantum-confined topological Dirac semimetal thin films and suggests
new routes to achieving high thermoelectric performance at cryogenic
temperatures.

<h3>Strong electron-phonon coupling and phonon-induced superconductivity in  tetragonal C$_3$N$_4$ with hole doping</h3>

<br>
C$_3$N$_4$ is a recently discovered phase of carbon-nitrides with the
tetragonal crystal structure (arXiv:2209.01968) that is stable at ambient
conditions. C$_3$N$_4$ is a semiconductor exhibiting flat-band anomalies in the
valence band, suggesting the emergence of many-body instabilities upon hole
doping. Here, using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations we show that
hole-doped C$_3$N$_4$ reveals strong electron-phonon coupling, leading to the
formation of a gapped superconducting state. The phase transition temperatures
turns out to be strongly dependent on the hole concentration. We propose that
holes could be injected into C$_3$N$_4$ via boron doping which induces,
according to our results, a rigid shift of the Fermi energy without significant
modification of the electronic structure. Based on the electron-phonon coupling
and Coulomb pseudopotential calculated from first principles, we conclude that
the boron concentration of 6 atoms per nm$^3$ would be required to reach the
critical temperature of $\sim$55 K at ambient pressure.

Harnessing electronic excitations involving coherent coupling to bosonic
modes is essential for the design and control of emergent phenomena in quantum
materials [1]. In situations where charge carriers induce a lattice distortion
due to the electron-phonon interaction, the conducting states get "dressed".
This leads to the formation of polaronic quasiparticles that dramatically
impact charge transport, surface reactivity, thermoelectric and optical
properties, as observed in a variety of crystals and interfaces composed of
polar materials [2-6]. Similarly, when oscillations of the charge density
couple to conduction electrons the more elusive plasmon polaron emerges [7],
which has been detected in electron-doped semiconductors [8-10]. However, the
exploration of polaronic effects on low energy excitations is still in its
infancy in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present the discovery of an
interlayer plasmon polaron in heterostructures composed of graphene on top of
SL WS$_2$. By using micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(microARPES) during in situ doping of the top graphene layer, we observe a
strong quasiparticle peak accompanied by several carrier density-dependent
shake-off replicas around the SL WS$_2$ conduction band minimum (CBM). Our
results are explained by an effective many-body model in terms of a coupling
between SL WS$_2$ conduction electrons and graphene plasmon modes. It is
important to take into account the presence of such interlayer collective
modes, as they have profound consequences for the electronic and optical
properties of heterostructures that are routinely explored in many device
architectures involving 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [11-15].

The properties of semiconductors and functional dielectrics are defined by
their response in electric fields, which may be perturbed by defects and the
strain they generate. In this work, we demonstrate how diffraction-based X-ray
microscopy techniques may be utilized to image the electric field in insulating
crystalline materials. By analysing a prototypical ferro- and piezoelectric
material, BaTiO$_{3}$, we identify trends that can guide experimental design
towards imaging the electric field using any diffraction-based X-ray microscopy
technique. We explain these trends in the context of dark-field X-ray
microscopy, but the framework is also valid for Bragg scanning probe X-ray
microscopy, Bragg coherent diffraction imaging and Bragg X-ray ptychography.
The ability to quantify electric field distributions alongside the defects and
strain already accessible via these techniques offers a more comprehensive
picture of the often complex structure-property relationships that exist in
many insulating and semiconducting materials.

<br>
The ferroelectric semiconductor $\alpha$-SnTe has been regarded as a
topological crystalline insulator and the dispersion of its surface states has
been intensively measured with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) over the last decade. However, much less attention has been given to
the impact of the ferroelectric transition on its electronic structure, and in
particular on its bulk states. Here, we investigate the low-energy electronic
structure of $\alpha$-SnTe with ARPES and follow the evolution of the
bulk-state Rashba splitting as a function of temperature, across its
ferroelectric critical temperature of about $T_c\sim 110$ K. Unexpectedly, we
observe a persistent band splitting up to room temperature, which is consistent
with an order-disorder contribution to the phase transition that requires the
presence of fluctuating local dipoles above $T_c$. We conclude that no
topological surface state can occur at the (111) surface of SnTe, at odds with
recent literature.

found a symmetric gapped $Z_2$ spin-liquid state for intermediate model

The recently discovered high-T$_C$ superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has
sparked renewed interest in the unconventional superconductivity. Here we study
the unconventional superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on
a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory.
Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer
$d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the
same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We
obtain a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane.
Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the
optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital
becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the
system. We discuss the interplay between the Fermi surface topology and
different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against
Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is examined.

Organic molecular crystals encompass a vast range of materials from
pharmaceuticals to organic optoelectronics and proteins to waxes in biological
and industrial settings. Crystal defects from grain boundaries to dislocations
are known to play key roles in mechanisms of growth and also in the functional
properties of molecular crystals. In contrast to the precise analysis of
individual defects in metals, ceramics, and inorganic semiconductors enabled by
electron microscopy, significantly greater ambiguity remains in the
experimental determination of individual dislocation character and slip systems
in molecular materials. In large part, nanoscale dislocation analysis in
molecular crystals has been hindered by the severely constrained electron
exposures required to avoid irreversibly degrading these crystals. Here, we
present a low-dose, single-exposure approach enabling nanometre-resolved
analysis of individual extended dislocations in molecular crystals. We
demonstrate the approach for a range of crystal types to reveal dislocation
character and operative slip systems unambiguously.

An electrical current that flows across individual atoms or molecules can
generate exotic quantum-based behavior, from memristive effects to Coulomb
blockade and the promotion of quantum excited states. These fundamental effects
typically appear one at a time in model junctions built using atomic tip or
lateral techniques. So far, however, a viable industrial pathway for such
discrete state devices has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that a
commercialized device platform can serve as this industrial pathway for quantum
technologies. We have studied magnetic tunnel junctions with a MgO barrier
containing C atoms. The paramagnetic localized electrons due to individual C
atoms generate parallel nanotransport paths across the micronic device as
deduced from magnetotransport experiments. Coulomb blockade effects linked to
tunnelling magnetoresistance peaks can be electrically controlled, leading to a
persistent memory effect. Our results position MgO tunneling spintronics as a
promising platform to industrially implement quantum technologies.

<h3>Meta-analysis of literature data in metal additive manufacturing: What  can we (and the machine) learn from reported data?</h3>

Obtaining in-depth understanding of the relationships between the additive
manufacturing (AM) process, microstructure and mechanical properties is crucial
to overcome barriers in AM. In this study, database of metal AM was created
thanks to many literature studies. Subsequently meta-analyses on the data was
undertaken to provide insights into whether such relationships are well
reflected in the literature data. The analyses help reveal the bias and what
the data tells us, and to what extent machine learning (ML) can learn from the
data. The first major bias is associated with common practices in identifying
the process based on optimizing the consolidation. Most reports were for
consolidation while data on microstructure and mechanical properties was
significantly less. In addition, only high consolidation values was provided,
so ML was not able to learn the full spectrum of the process - consolidation
relationship. The common identification of process maps based on only
consolidation also poses another bias as mechanical properties that ultimately
govern the quality of an AM build are controlled not only by the consolidation,
but also microstructure. Meta-analysis of the literature data also shows weak
correlation between process with consolidation and mechanical properties. This
weak correlation is attributed to the stated biases and the non-monotonic and
non-linear relationships between the process and quality variables.
Fortunately, trained ML models capture well the influence and interactions
between process parameters and quality variables, and predicts accurately the
yield stress, suggesting that the correlation between process, microstructure
and yield strength is well reflected in the data. Lastly, due to the current
limitation in the process map identification, we propose to identify the
process map based on not only the consolidation, but also mechanical
properties.

<h3>Beyond domain alignment: Revealing the effect of intrinsic magnetic  order on electrochemical water splitting</h3>

To reach a long term viable green hydrogen economy, rational design of active
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is critical. An important hurdle in
this reaction originates from the fact that the reactants are singlet
molecules, whereas the oxygen molecule has a triplet ground state with parallel
spin alignment, implying that magnetic order in the catalyst is essential.
Accordingly, multiple experimentalists reported a positive effect of external
magnetic fields on OER activity of ferromagnetic catalysts. However, it remains
a challenge to investigate the influence of the intrinsic magnetic order on
catalytic activity. Here, we tuned the intrinsic magnetic order of epitaxial
La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ thin film model catalysts from ferro- to
paramagnetic by changing the temperature in-situ during water electrolysis.
Using this strategy, we show that ferromagnetic ordering below the Curie
temperature enhances OER activity. Moreover, we show a slight current density
enhancement upon application of an external magnetic field and find that the
dependence of magnetic field direction correlates with the magnetic anisotropy
in the catalyst film. Our work thus suggests that both the intrinsic magnetic
order in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ films and magnetic domain alignment
increase their catalytic activity. We observe no long-range magnetic order at
the catalytic surface, implying that the OER enhancement is connected to the
magnetic order of the bulk catalyst. Combining the effects found with existing
literature, we propose a unifying picture for the spin-polarized enhancement in
magnetic oxide catalysts.

<h3>Demystify the mixed-parity pairing of attractive fermions with  spin-orbit coupling in optical lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
The admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states in
superconductors can be typically induced by breaking spatial inversion
symmetry. Employing the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field Quantum Monte
Carlo method, we study such mixed-parity pairing phenomena of attractive
fermions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in two-dimensional optical
lattice at finite temperature. We systematically demystify the evolution of the
essential pairing structure in both singlet and triplet channels versus the
temperature, fermion filling, SOC and interaction strengths, via computing the
condensate fraction and pair wave function. Our numerical results reveal that
the singlet channel dominates in the fermion pairing and the triplet pairing
has relatively small contribution to the superfluidity for physically relevant
parameters. In contrast to the singlet channel mainly consisted of the on-site
Cooper pairs, the triplet pairing has plentiful patterns in real space with the
largest contributions from several nearest neighbors. As the SOC strengh
increases, the pairing correlation is firstly enhanced and then suppressed for
triplet pairing while it's simply weakened in singlet channel. We have also
obtained the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperatures through
the finite-size analysis of condensate fraction. Our results can serve as
quantitative guide for future optical lattice experiments as well as accurate
benchmarks for theories and other numerical methods.

<br>
Altermagnets are compensated magnets with unconvetional $d$, $g$ and $i$-wave
spin-channel order in reciprocal space. So far the search for new altermagnetic
candidates has been focused on materials in which the magnetic unit cell is
identical to the non-magnetic one, i.e. magnetic structures with zero
propagation vector. Here, we substantially broaden the family of altermagnetic
candidates by predicting supercell altermagnets. Their magnetic unit cell is
constructed by enlarging the paramagnetic primitive unit cell, resulting in a
non-zero propagation vector for the magnetic structure. This connection of the
magnetic configuration to the ordering of sublattices gives an extra degree of
freedom to supercell altermagnets, which can allow for the control over the
order parameter spatial orientation. We identify realistic candidates MnSe$_2$
with a $d$-wave order, and RbCoBr$_3$, CsCoCr$_3$, and BaMnO$_3$ with $g$-wave
order. We demonstrate the reorientation of the order parameter in MnSe$_2$,
which has two different magnetic configurations, whose energy difference is
only 5 meV, opening the possibility of controlling the orientation of the
altermagnetic order parameter by external perturbations.

We investigate the geometrically nonlinear deformation and buckling of a
slender elastic beam subject to time-dependent `fictitious' (non-inertial)
forces arising from unsteady rotation. Using a rotary apparatus that accurately
imposes an angular acceleration around a fixed axis, we demonstrate that
centrifugal and Euler forces can be combined to produce tunable structural
deformation. Specifically, using an imposed acceleration ramp, the buckling
onset of a cantilevered beam can be precisely tuned and its deformation
direction selected. In a second configuration, a pre-arched beam can be made to
snap, on demand, between its two stable states. We also formulate a theoretical
model rooted in Euler's elastica that rationalizes the problem and provides
predictions in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data. Our
findings demonstrate an innovative approach to programmable actuation of
slender rotating structures.

<h3>Post-experiment coincidence counting method for coincidence detection  techniques</h3>

Recently, two coincidence detection techniques, the coincidence
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and the coincidence
inelastic neutron scattering (cINS), have been proposed to detect directly the
two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle
channel or two-spin channel. In the original proposals, there is a coincidence
detector which records the coincidence probability of two photoelectric
processes or two neutron-scattering processes. In this article, we present a
{\it post-experiment} coincidence counting method for the proposed coincidence
detection techniques without a coincidence detector. It requires a
time-resolved {\it pulse} photon or neutron source. Suppose $I_{d_1}^{(1)}$
records the emitted photoelectron or the scattered neutron arrived at the
detector $D_1$ and similarly $I_{d_2}^{(1)}$ records the counting arrived at
the detector $D_2$ within one time window between sequential two incident
pulses. The coincidence counting can be defined by $I_d^{(2)}=I_{d_1}^{(1)}
\times I_{d_2}^{(1)}$, which records the coincidence probability of two
photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes within this time
window. Therefore, $I_d^{(2)}$ involves the two-body correlations of the target
electrons. The previously proposed cARPES and cINS can be implemented upon the
time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatuses with pulse sources.

<h3>Universal Approach to Critical Percolation</h3>

<br>
<i>Fabian Coupette, Tanja Schilling</i>
<br>
<br>
Percolation problems appear in a large variety of different contexts ranging
from the design of composite materials to vaccination strategies on community
networks. The key observable for many applications is the percolation
threshold. Unlike the universal critical exponents, the percolation threshold
depends explicitly on the specific system properties. As a consequence,
theoretical approaches to the percolation threshold are rare and generally
tailored to the specific application.
Yet, any percolating cluster forms a discrete network the emergence of which
can be cast as a graph problem and analyzed using branching processes. We
propose a general mapping of any kind of percolation problem onto a branching
process which provides rigorous lower bounds of the percolation threshold.
These bounds progressively tighten as we incorporate more information into the
theory. We showcase our approach for different continuum problems finding
accurate predictions with almost no effort. Our approach is based on first
principles and does not require fitting parameters. As such it offers an
important theoretical reference in a field that is dominated by simulation
studies and heuristic fit functions.

Organic/inorganic interfaces formed by monolayer substrates and conjugated
molecular adsorbates are attractive material platforms leveraging the
modularity of organic compounds together with the long-range phenomena typical
of condensed matter. New quantum states are known to be generated by electronic
interactions in these systems as well as by their coupling with light. However,
little is still known about hybrid vibrational modes. In this work, we discover
from first principles the existence of an infrared-active chiral phonon mode in
a pyrene-decorated MoSe$_{2}$ monolayer given by the combination of a
frustrated rotation of the molecule around its central axis and an optical mode
in the substrate. Our results suggest the possibility to enable phonon
chirality in molecular superlattices.

A natural phenomenon occurring in a living system is an outcome of the
dynamics of the specific biological network underlying the phenomenon. The
collective dynamics have both deterministic and stochastic components. The
stochastic nature of the key processes like gene expression and cell
differentiation give rise to fluctuations (noise) in the levels of the
biomolecules and this combined with nonlinear interactions give rise to a
number of emergent phenomena. In this review, we describe and discuss some of
these phenomena which have the character of phase transitions in physical
systems. We specifically focus on noise-induced transitions in a stochastic
model of gene expression and in a population genetics model which have no
analogs when the dynamics are solely deterministic in nature. Some of these
transitions exhibit critical-point phenomena belonging to the mean-field Ising
universality class of equilibrium phase transitions. A number of other
examples, ranging from biofilms to homeostasis in adult tissues, are also
discussed which exhibit behavior similar to critical phenomena in equilibrium
and nonequilbrium phase transitions. The examples illustrate how the subject of
statistical mechanics provides a bridge between theoretical models and
experimental observations.

Highly tunable properties make Mn(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_4$ a rich playground for
exploring the interplay between band topology and magnetism: On one end,
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, while the
magnetic structure of MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ (MST) can be tuned between
antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic. Motivated to control electronic properties
through real-space magnetic textures, we use magnetic force microscopy (MFM) to
image the domains of ferrimagnetic MST. We find that magnetic field tunes
between stripe and bubble domain morphologies, raising the possibility of
topological spin textures. Moreover, we combine in situ transport with domain
manipulation and imaging to both write MST device properties and directly
measure the scaling of the Hall response with domain area. This work
demonstrates measurement of the local anomalous Hall response using MFM, and
opens the door to reconfigurable domain-based devices in the M(B,S)T family.

Granular materials -- aggregates of many discrete, disconnected solid
particles -- are ubiquitous in natural and industrial settings. Predictive
models for their behavior have wide ranging applications, e.g. in defense,
mining, construction, pharmaceuticals, and the exploration of planetary
surfaces. In many of these applications, granular materials mix and interact
with liquids and gases, changing their effective behavior in non-intuitive
ways. Although such materials have been studied for more than a century, a
unified description of their behaviors remains elusive.
In this work, we develop a model for granular materials and mixtures that is
usable under particularly challenging conditions: high-velocity impact events.
This model combines descriptions for the many deformation mechanisms that are
activated during impact -- particle fracture and breakage; pore collapse and
dilation; shock loading; and pore fluid coupling -- within a thermo-mechanical
framework based on poromechanics and mixture theory. This approach allows for
simultaneous modeling of the granular material and the pore fluid, and includes
both their independent motions and their complex interactions. A general form
of the model is presented alongside its specific application to two types of
sands that have been studied in the literature. The model predictions are shown
to closely match experimental observation of these materials through several
GPa stresses, and simulations are shown to capture the different dynamic
responses of dry and fully-saturated sand to projectile impacts at 1.3 km/s.

By expanding the gauge $\lambda_n(k)$ for magnon band $n$ in harmonics of
momentum ${\bf k} =(k,\phi )$, we demonstrate that the only observable
component of the magnon orbital angular momentum $O_n({\bf k})$ is its angular
average over all angles $\phi$, denoted by $F_n(k)$. For both the FM honeycomb
and zig-zag lattices, we show that $F_n(k)$ is nonzero in the presence of a
Dzyalloshinzkii-Moriya (DM) interaction. The FM zig-zag lattice model with
exchange interactions $0<J_1< J_2$ provides a new system where the effects of
orbital angular momentum are observable. For the zig-zag model with equal
exchange interactions $J_{1x}$ and $J_{1y}$ along the $x$ and $y$ axis, the
magnon bands are degenerate along the boundaries of the Brillouin zone with
$k_x-k_y =\pm \pi/a$ and the Chern numbers $C_n$ are not well defined. However,
a revised model with $J_{1y}\ne J_{1x}$ lifts those degeneracy and produces
well-defined Chern numbers of $C_n=\pm 1$ for the two magnon bands. When
$J_{1y}=J_{1x}$, the thermal conductivity $\kappa^{xy}(T)$ of the FM zig-zag
lattice is largest for $J_2/J_1>6$ but is still about four times smaller than
that of the FM honeycomb lattice at high temperatures. Due to the removal of
band degeneracies, $\kappa^{xy}(T)$ is slightly enhanced when $J_{1y}\ne
J_{1x}$.

Ultrafast light-matter interaction has emerged as a powerful tool to control
and probe the macroscopic properties of functional materials, especially
two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides which can form different
structural phases with distinct physical properties. However, it is often
difficult to accurately determine the transient optical constants. In this
work, we developed a near-infrared pump - terahertz to midinfrared (12-22 THz)
probe system in transmission geometry to measure the transient optical
conductivity in 2H-MoTe2 layered material. By performing separate measurements
on bulk and thin-film samples, we are able to overcome issues related to
nonuniform substrate thickness and penetration depth mismatch and to extract
the transient optical constants reliably. Our results show that photoexcitation
at 690 nm induces a transient insulator-metal transition, while photoexcitation
at 2 um has a much smaller effect due to the photon energy being smaller than
the band gap of the material. Combining this with a single-color pump-probe
measurement, we show that the transient response evolves towards 1T' phase at
higher flunece. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the
photoinduced phase transition in the 2H-MoTe2 system.

While colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) in Eu-based compounds is often
associated with strong spin-carrier interactions, the underlying reconstruction
of the electronic bands is much less understood from spectroscopic experiments.
Here using angle-resolved photoemission, we directly observe an electronic band
reconstruction across the insulator-metal (and magnetic) transition in the
recently discovered CMR compound EuCd2P2. This transition is manifested by a
large magnetic band splitting associated with the magnetic order, as well as
unusual energy shifts of the valence bands: both the large ordered moment of Eu
and carrier localization in the paramagnetic phase are crucial. Our results
provide spectroscopic evidence for an electronic structure reconstruction
underlying the enormous CMR observed in EuCd2P2, which could be important for
understanding Eu-based CMR materials, as well as designing CMR materials based
on large-moment rare-earth magnets.

Generalized multifractality characterizes system size dependence of pure
scaling local observables at Anderson transitions in all ten symmetry classes
of disordered systems. Recently, the concept of generalized multifractality has
been extended to boundaries of critical disordered noninteracting systems. Here
we study the generalized boundary multifractality in the presence of
electron-electron interaction, focusing on the spin quantum Hall symmetry class
(class C). Employing the two-loop renormalization group analysis within
Finkel'stein nonlinear sigma model we compute the anomalous dimensions of the
pure scaling operators located at the boundary of the system. We find that
generalized boundary multifractal exponents are twice larger than their bulk
counterparts. Exact symmetry relations between generalized boundary
multifractal exponents in the case of noninteracting systems are explicitly
broken by the interaction.

The structure of amorphous silicon is widely thought of as a
fourfold-connected random network, and yet it is defective atoms, with fewer or
more than four bonds, that make it particularly interesting. Despite many
attempts to explain such "dangling-bond" and "floating-bond" defects,
respectively, a unified understanding is still missing. Here, we show that
atomistic machine-learning methods can reveal the complex structural and
energetic landscape of defects in amorphous silicon. We study an
ultra-large-scale, quantum-accurate structural model containing a million
atoms, and more than ten thousand defects, allowing reliable defect-related
statistics to be obtained. We combine structural descriptors and
machine-learned local atomic energies to develop a universal classification of
the different types of defects in amorphous silicon. The results suggest a
revision of the established floating-bond model by showing that
fivefold-coordinated atoms in amorphous silicon exhibit a wide range of local
environments, and it is shown that fivefold (but not threefold) coordination
defects tend to cluster together. Our study provides new insights into one of
the most widely studied amorphous solids, and has general implications for
modelling and understanding defects in disordered materials beyond silicon
alone.

<h3>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry in Non-Hermitian Dirac Materials</h3>

We propose a general construction of symmetry protected Lorentz invariant
non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals (DSMs), realized by invoking masslike
anti-Hermitian Dirac operators to its Hermitian counterpart. They feature
purely real or imaginary isotropic linear band dispersion, yielding a vanishing
density of states. Dynamic mass orderings in NH DSMs thus take place for strong
Hubbardlike local interactions through a quantum phase transition where nodal
NH Dirac quasiparticles are strongly coupled with bosonic order-parameter
fluctuations, hosting a non-Fermi liquid, beyond which the system becomes an
insulator. Depending on the internal Clifford algebra between the NH Dirac
operator and candidate mass order-parameter, the resulting quantum critical
fluid either remains coupled with the environment or recovers full Hermiticity
by decoupling from the bath, while always enjoying an emergent Yukawa-Lorentz
symmetry in terms of a unique velocity. We showcase the competition between
such mass orderings, their hallmarks on quasiparticle spectra in the ordered
phases, and the relevance of our findings in correlated designer NH Dirac
materials.

Nontrivial bulk topological invariants of quantum materials can leave their
signatures on charge, thermal and spin transports. In two dimensions, their
imprints can be experimentally measured from well-developed multi-terminal Hall
bar arrangements. Here, we numerically compute the low temperature ($T$)
thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$) and zero temperature spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall
conductivities, and longitudinal thermal conductance ($G^{th}_{xx}$) of various
paradigmatic two-dimensional fully gapped topological superconductors,
belonging to distinct Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, namely $p+ip$ (class
D), $d+id$ (class C) and $p \pm ip$ (class DIII) paired states, in mesoscopic
six-terminal Hall bar setups from the scattering matrix formalism using Kwant.
In both clean and weak disorder limits, the time-reversal symmetry breaking
$p+ip$ and $d+id$ pairings show half-quantized and quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ [in
units of $\kappa_0=\pi^2 k^2_B T/(3h)$], respectively, while the latter one in
addition accommodates a quantized $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ [in units of
$\sigma^{sp}_0=\hbar/(8 \pi)$]. By contrast, the time-reversal invariant $p \pm
ip$ pairing only displays a quantized $G^{th}_{xx}$ at low $T$ up to a moderate
strength of disorder. In the strong disorder regime, all these topological
responses ($\kappa_{xy}$, $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ and $G^{th}_{xx}$) vanish.
Possible material platforms hosting such paired states and manifesting these
robust topological thermal and spin responses are highlighted.
