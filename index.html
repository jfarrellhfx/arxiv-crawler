<h3>Charge delocalization and hyperpolarizability in ionic liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17330" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17330</a>
<br>
<i>C. D. Rodriguez-Fernandez L. M. Varela, C. Schroder, E. Lopez Lago</i>
<p>In this work the role that charge delocalization plays in the non-linear
optical response of ionic liquids is evaluated. The first hyperpolarizability
for the non-linear process of second harmonic generation (SHG) and second
hyperpolarizability for the non-linear process of electro-optical Kerr-Effect
(EOKE) of a large number of ionic liquid forming ions were estimated by means
of density functional theory calculations. The results point to that both
charge delocalization and molecular geometry are the key features that govern
their hyperpolarizabilities. Our findings show that some of the most commonly
used anions in ionic liquids are expected to present strong non-linear
responses while common cations present a much more limited performance.
However, this limitation can be overcome by a proper tailoring of cations to
present charge delocalization over large molecular regions. The hypothesis of
additivity of hyperpolarizabilities in ionic liquids is tested and exploited to
obtain a map of second and third order non-linear susceptibilities of 1496 ion
combinations. This map is intended to be a guide for future works on the
hyperpolarizability of ILs

<h3>High-k gadolinium scandate on Si obtained by high pressure sputtering  from metal targets and in-situ plasma oxidation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17332" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17332</a>
<br>
<i>María Ángela Pampillón, Enrique San Andrés, Pedro Carlos Feijoo, José Luis G. Fierro</i>
<p>This article studies the physical and electrical behavior of Gd2-xScxO3
layers grown by high pressure sputtering from metallic Gd and Sc targets. The
aim is to obtain a high permittivity dielectric for microelectronic
applications. The films were obtained by the deposition of a metallic
nanolaminate of Gd and Sc alternating layers, which is afterwards in-situ
oxidized by plasma. The oxide films obtained were close to stoichiometry,
amorphous and with minimal interfacial regrowth. By fabricating
metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors we found that a moderate temperature
annealing is needed to enhance permittivity, which reaches a high value of 32
while keeping moderate leakage. Finally, the feasibility of interface
scavenging in this material with Ti gate electrodes is also demonstrated.

<h3>Scavenging effect on plasma oxidized Gd$_2$O$_3$ grown by high pressure  sputtering on Si and InP substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17333" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17333</a>
<br>
<i>María Ángela Pampillón, Pedro Carlos Feijoo, Enrique San Andrés, Héctor García, Helena Castán, Salvador Dueñas</i>
<p>In this work, we analyze the scavenging effect of titanium gates on metal
insulator semiconductor capacitors composed of gadolinium oxide as dielectric
material deposited on Si and InP substrates. The Gd$_2$O$_3$ film was grown by
high pressure sputtering from a metallic target followed by an in situ plasma
oxidation. The thickness of the Ti film was varied between 2.5 and 17 nm and
was capped with a Pt layer. For the devices grown on Si, a layer of 5 nm of Ti
decreases the capacitance equivalent thickness from 2.3 to 1.9 nm without
compromising the leakage current (1e-4 A cm$^{-2}$ at Vgate equal to 1 V).
Thinner Ti has little impact on device performance, while 17 nm of Ti produces
excessive scavenging. For InP capacitors, the scavenging effect is also
observed with a decrease in the capacitance equivalent thickness from 2.5 to
1.9 nm (or an increase in the accumulation capacitance after the annealing from
1.4 to 1.7-1.8 uF cm$^{-2}$). The leakage current density remains under 1e-2 A
cm$^{-2}$ at Vgate equal to 1.5 V. For these devices, a severe flatband voltage
shift with frequency is observed. This can be explained by a very high
interface trap state density (in the order of 1e13-1e14 eV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$).

<h3>In situ GaN decomposition analysis by quadrupole mass spectrometry and  reflection high-energy electron diffraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17339</a>
<br>
<i>S. Fernández-Garrido, G. Koblmüller, E. Calleja, J. S. Speck</i>
<p>Thermal decomposition of wurtzite (0001)-oriented GaN was analyzed: in
vacuum, under active N exposure, and during growth by rf-plasma assisted
molecular beam epitaxy. The GaN decomposition rate was determined by
measurements of the Ga desorption using in situ quadrupole mass spectrometry,
which showed Arrhenius behavior with an apparent activation energy of 3.1 eV.
Clear signatures of intensity oscillations during reflection high-energy
electron diffraction measurements facilitated complementary evaluation of the
decomposition rate and highlighted a layer-by-layer decomposition mode in
vacuum. Exposure to active nitrogen, either under vacuum or during growth under
N-rich growth conditions, strongly reduced the GaN losses due to GaN
decomposition.

<h3>Microscopic Model for Fractional Quantum Hall Nematics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17352" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17352</a>
<br>
<i>Songyang Pu, Ajit C. Balram, Joseph Taylor, Eduardo Fradkin, Zlatko Papić</i>
<p>Geometric fluctuations of the density mode in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
state can give rise to a nematic FQH phase, a topological state with a
spontaneously broken rotational symmetry. While experiments on FQH states in
the second Landau level have reported signatures of putative FQH nematics in
anisotropic transport, a realistic model for this state has been lacking. We
show that the standard model of particles in the lowest Landau level
interacting via the Coulomb potential realizes the FQH nematic transition,
which is reached by a progressive reduction of the strength of the
shortest-range Haldane pseudopotential. Using exact diagonalization and
variational wave functions, we demonstrate that the FQH nematic transition
occurs when the system's neutral gap closes in the long-wavelength limit while
the charge gap remains open. We confirm the symmetry-breaking nature of the
transition by demonstrating the existence of a ``circular moat'' potential in
the manifold of states with broken rotational symmetry, while its geometric
character is revealed through the strong fluctuations of the nematic
susceptibility and Hall viscosity.

<h3>Theory of a Strange Metal in a Quantum Superconductor to Metal  Transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17353" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17353</a>
<br>
<i>Jaewon Kim, Erez Berg, Ehud Altman</i>
<p>Recent experiments with nanopatterned thin films revealed an unusual quantum
superconductor to metal phase transition (QSMT) with a linear in temperature
resistivity. In contrast, most known examples of such transitions and standard
theoretical considerations predict a temperature-independent sheet resistance
of order $R_Q = \frac{\hbar}{e^2}$. We propose an effective theory of a
disordered superconductor which features a QSMT with robust $T$ linear
resistivity at the critical point. The crucial ingredient in our model is
spatial disorder in the pairing interaction. Such random pairing mirrors the
emergent phase disorder seen in a recent mean field study of a microscopic
$d$-wave superconductor subject to potential disorder. We also make the
prediction that in such systems the diamagnetic susceptibility diverges as
$\log\frac{\Lambda}{T}$, which starkly differs from the power law divergence in
standard XY transitions.

<h3>Mixed-state quantum anomaly and multipartite entanglement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17357</a>
<br>
<i>Leonardo A. Lessa, Meng Cheng, Chong Wang</i>
<p>Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly
useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising
connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More
specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with
anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in
the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$
that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is
necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of
$d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared
from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so
the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results
in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d>1$. The anomaly-nonseparability
connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with
nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement (even in $d=1$). We also
briefly discuss mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries,
including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly.

<h3>Tapestry of dualities in decohered quantum error correction codes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17359</a>
<br>
<i>Kaixiang Su, Zhou Yang, Chao-Ming Jian</i>
<p>Quantum error correction (QEC) codes protect quantum information from errors
due to decoherence. Many of them also serve as prototypical models for exotic
topological quantum matters. Investigating the behavior of the QEC codes under
decoherence sheds light on not only the codes' robustness against errors but
also new out-of-equilibrium quantum phases driven by decoherence. The phase
transitions, including the error threshold, of the decohered QEC codes can be
probed by the systems' R\'enyi entropies $S_R$ with different R\'enyi indices
$R$. In this paper, we study the general construction of the statistical models
that characterize the R\'enyi entropies of QEC codes decohered by Pauli noise.
We show that these statistical models can be organized into a "tapestry" woven
by rich duality relations among them. For Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes
with bit-flip and phase-flip errors, we show that each R\'enyi entropy is
captured by a pair of dual statistical models with randomness. For
$R=2,3,\infty$, there are additional dualities that map between the two error
types, relating the critical bit-flip and phase-flip error rates of the
decoherence-induced phase transitions in the CSS codes. For CSS codes with an
"$em$ symmetry" between the $X$-type and the $Z$-type stabilizers, the
dualities with $R=2,3,\infty$ become self-dualities with super-universal
self-dual error rates. These self-dualities strongly constrain the phase
transitions of the code signaled by $S_{R=2,3,\infty}$. For general stabilizer
codes decohered by generic Pauli noise, we also construct the statistical
models that characterize the systems' entropies and obtain general duality
relations between Pauli noise with different error rates.

<h3>Floquet-Bloch Theory for Nonperturbative Response to a Static Drive</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17368</a>
<br>
<i>Christophe De Beule, Steven Gassner, Spenser Talkington, E. J. Mele</i>
<p>We develop the Floquet-Bloch theory of noninteracting fermions on a periodic
lattice in the presence of a constant electric field. As long as the field lies
along a reciprocal lattice vector, time periodicity of the Bloch Hamiltonian is
inherited from the evolution of momentum in the Brillouin zone. The
corresponding Floquet quasienergies yield the Wannier-Stark ladder with
interband couplings included to all orders. These results are compared to
perturbative results where the lowest-order interband correction gives the
field-induced polarization shift in terms of the electric susceptibility.
Additionally, we investigate electronic transport by coupling the system to a
bath within the Floquet-Keldysh formalism. We then study the breakdown of the
band-projected theory from the onset of interband contributions and Zener
resonances in the band-resolved currents. In particular, we consider the
transverse quantum-geometric response in two spatial dimensions due to the
Berry curvature. In the strong-field regime, the semiclassical theory predicts
a plateau of the geometric response as a function of field strength. Here, we
scrutinize the conditions under which the semiclassical results continue to
hold in the quantum theory.

<h3>Picosecond transfer from short-term to long-term memory in analog  antiferromagnetic memory device</h3>

<i>M. Surynek, J. Zubac, K. Olejnik, A. Farkas, F. Krizek, L. Nadvornik, P. Kubascik, F. Trojanek, R.P. Campion, V. Novak, T. Jungwirth, P. Nemec</i>
<p>Experiments in materials with a compensated ordering of magnetic moments have
demonstrated a potential for approaching the thermodynamic limit of the fastest
and least-dissipative operation of a digital memory bit. In addition, these
materials are very promising for a construction of energy-efficient analog
devices with neuromorphic functionalities, which are inspired by
computing-in-memory capabilities of the human brain. In this paper, we report
on experimental separation of switching-related and heat-related resistance
signal dynamics in memory devices microfabricated from CuMnAs antiferromagnetic
metal. We show that the memory variable multilevel resistance can be used as a
long-term memory (LTM), lasting up to minutes at room temperature. In addition,
ultrafast reflectivity change and heat dissipation from nanoscale-thickness
CuMnAs films, taking place on picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds time
scales, can be used as a short-term memory (STM). Information about input
stimuli, represented by femtosecond laser pulses, can be transferred from STM
to LTM after rehearsals at picosecond to nanosecond times in these memory
devices, where information can be retrieved at times up to 10^15 longer than
the input pulse duration. Our results open a route towards ultra-fast low-power
implementations of spiking neuron and synapse functionalities using a resistive
analog antiferromagnetic memory.

<h3>Fermi Surface Geometry and Optical Conductivity of a 2D Electron Gas  near an Ising-Nematic Quantum Critical Point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17392" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17392</a>
<br>
<i>Yasha Gindikin, Andrey Chubukov</i>
<p>We analyze optical conductivity of a clean two-dimensional electron system in
a Fermi liquid regime near a $T=0$ Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP),
and extrapolate the results to a QCP. We employ direct perturbation theory up
to the two-loop order to elucidate how the Fermi surface's geometry (convex vs.
concave) and fermionic dispersion (parabolic vs. non-parabolic) affect the
scaling of the optical conductivity, $\sigma(\omega)$, with frequency $\omega$
and correlation length $\xi$. We find that for a convex Fermi surface the
leading terms in the optical conductivity cancel out, leaving a sub-leading
contribution $\sigma (\omega) \propto \omega^2 \xi^4 \mathcal{L}$, where
$\mathcal{L} = \mathrm{const}$ for a parabolic dispersion and $\mathcal{L}
\propto \log{\omega \xi^3}$ in a generic case. For a concave Fermi surface, the
leading terms do not cancel, and $\sigma (\omega) \propto \xi^2$. We
extrapolate these results to a QCP and obtain $\sigma (\omega) \propto
\omega^{2/3}$ for a convex Fermi surface and $\sigma (\omega) \propto
1/\omega^{2/3}$ for a concave Fermi surface.

<h3>Absence of disordered Thouless pumps at finite frequency</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17395" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17395</a>
<br>
<i>Dominik Vuina, David M. Long, Philip J. D. Crowley, Anushya Chandran</i>
<p>A Thouless pump is a slowly driven one-dimensional band insulator which pumps
charge at a quantised rate. Previous work showed that pumping persists in
weakly disordered chains, and separately in clean chains at finite drive
frequency. We study the interplay of disorder and finite frequency, and show
that the pump rate always decays to zero due to non-adiabatic transitions
between the instantaneous eigenstates. However, the decay is slow, occurring on
a time-scale that is exponentially large in the period of the drive. In the
adiabatic limit, the band gap in the instantaneous spectrum closes at a
critical disorder strength above which pumping ceases. We predict the scaling
of the pump rate around this transition from a model of scattering between rare
states near the band edges. Our predictions can be experimentally tested in
ultracold atomic and photonic platforms.

<h3>On the mechanical, thermoelectric, and excitonic properties of  Tetragraphene monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17406" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17406</a>
<br>
<i>Raphael M. Tromer, L. A. Ribeiro Júnior, Douglas S. Galvão, Alexandre C. Dias, Elie A. Moujaes</i>
<p>Two-dimensional carbon allotropes have attracted much attention due to their
extraordinary optoelectronic and mechanical properties, which can be exploited
for energy conversion and storage applications. In this work, we use density
functional theory simulations and semi-empirical methods to investigate the
mechanical, thermoelectric, and excitonic properties of Tetrahexcarbon (also
known as Tetragraphene). This quasi-2D carbon allotrope exhibits a combination
of squared and hexagonal rings in a buckled shape. Our findings reveal that
tetragraphene is a semiconductor material with a direct electronic bandgap of
2.66 eV. Despite the direct nature of the electronic band structure, this
material has an indirect exciton ground state of 2.30 eV, which results in an
exciton binding energy of 0.36 eV. At ambient temperature, we obtain that the
lattice thermal conductivity for tetragraphene is approximately 118 W/mK.
Young's modulus and the shear modulus of tetragraphene are almost isotropic,
with maximum values of 286.0 N/m and 133.7 N/m, respectively, while exhibiting
a very low anisotropic Poisson ratio value of 0.09.

<h3>Magneto-synthesis effect on magnetic order, phonons, and magnons in  single-crystal Sr$_2$IrO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17407" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17407</a>
<br>
<i>Nicholas Pellatz, Jungho Kim, Jong-Woo Kim, Itamar Kimchi, Gang Cao, Dmitry Reznik</i>
<p>It was shown earlier that applying a magnetic field during the growth of
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, also known as "field-alteration", induces significant changes to
its structural, magnetic, and transport properties. However, the microscopic
nature of these changes is enigmatic. In this study, we employed resonant
elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, as well as Raman scattering, to
investigate samples from two batches of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ grown in magnetic fields
of different strengths. Our findings reveal that samples grown in a weaker
magnetic field have similar magnetic order to non-altered samples, whereas
those grown in a stronger field show a different stacking of weak in-plane
ferromagnetic moments. Additionally, we observed significant softening and
broadening of select Raman-active phonons in the field altered samples, with a
stronger effect in the samples grown in the stronger field. We discuss insights
that our results provide into the microscopic nature of field-alteration in
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$.

<h3>Development of biochar molecular models with controlled porosity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17414</a>
<br>
<i>Audrey Ngambia Ondřej Mašek, Valentina Erastova</i>
<p>Biochars are an exciting class of environmental materials with a wide range
of applications, including carbon storage and sequestration, soil enhancement,
and pollution remediation. However, the limited knowledge of their molecular
structures and compositions and the lack of comprehensive understanding of the
relationship between these structures and biochars' diverse functionality, is
hindering advancements in their development. In this work, we further advance
the approach, first introduced by Wood et al. (2023), to constructing biochar
molecular models; and now include control of microporosity (pores < 2 nm size)
within the developed models. We construct biochar models representative of
woody biochars which are experimentally produced at 600 -- 650 oC highest
heating temperatures. Our models reproduce experimental H/C and O/C atomic
ratios, percentage aromatic carbon, true density, cumulative porosity, and pore
size distribution. The development of microporous biochar molecular models
allows us to identify the importance of chemical structures involved in the
assembly of biochar materials, and describe the relationship between these
structures and obtained micropores. To facilitate other researchers integrating
our approach into their work, we detail the steps taken, including the tests
and reasons for each decision, in the construction of the biochar models.
Furthermore, we share our developed molecular models in a format that can be
easily integrated into other group's work in the form of molecular dynamics
simulations.

<h3>Effect of the Sc/Zr ratio on the corrosion resistance of Al-Mg cast  alloys</h3>

<i>N. A. Kozlova, V. N. Chuvil'deev, A. V. Nokhrin, Y. S. Shadrina, A. A. Bobrov, M. K. Chegurov</i>
<p>The results of investigations of the corrosion resistance of Al-Mg-Sc-Zr
alloys with varying Mg content and different Sc/Zr ratios are presented. The
objects of investigations were the Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloys with total Sc + Zr
content of 0.32 wt%. The concentration of Sc and Zr in the alloys varied with
the increments of 0.02 wt%. The alloys were produced by induction casting. The
effect of annealing temperature on the microhardness and electrical resistivity
of the Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloys was investigated. Corrosion tests were carried out in
a medium simulating intergranular corrosion in aluminum alloys. Electrochemical
studies and mass loss tests were performed. An increase in the Sc concentration
and a decrease in the Zr one were shown to result in an increase in the
corrosion rate. The primary Al3(ScxZr1-x) particles were found to have the main
effect on the corrosion resistance of Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloys. The dependence of the
corrosion current on the annealing temperature of the Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy was
found to have a non-monotonous character (with a maximum).

<h3>Ultrafast measurements under anisotropic strain reveal near equivalence  of competing charge orders in TbTe$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17437" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17437</a>
<br>
<i>Soyeun Kim, Gal Orenstein, Anisha G. Singh, Ian R. Fisher, David A. Reis, Mariano Trigo</i>
<p>We report ultrafast reflectivity measurements of the dynamics of the order
parameter of the charge density wave (CDW) in TbTe$_3$ under anisotropic
strain. We observe an increase in the frequency of the amplitude mode with
increasing tensile strain along the $a$-axis (which drives the lattice into
$a>c$, with $a$ and $c$ the lattice constants), and similar behavior for
tensile strain along $c$ ($c>a$). This suggests that both strains stabilize the
corresponding CDW order and further support the near equivalence of the CDW
phases oriented in $a$- and $c$-axis, in spite of the orthorhombic space group.
The results were analyzed within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau framework,
which agrees well with the reflectivity dynamics.

<h3>Topological Hall effect induced by chiral fluctuations in a kagome  lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>Kyle Fruhling, Alenna Streeter, Sougata Mardanya, Xiaoping Wang, Priya Baral, Oksana Zaharko, Igor I. Mazin, Sugata Chowdhury, William D. Ratcliff, Fazel Tafti</i>
<p>Topological Hall effect (THE) is a hallmark of scalar spin chirality, which
is found in static skyrmion lattices. Recent theoretical works have shown that
scalar spin chirality could also emerge dynamically from thermal spin
fluctuations. Evidence of such a mechanism was found in the kagome magnet
YMn6Sn6 where fluctuations arise from frustrated exchange interactions between
Mn kagome layers. In YMn6Sn6, the rare-earth ion Y3+ is non-magnetic. When it
is replaced by a magnetic ion (Gd3+-Ho3+), the intrinsically antiferromagnetic
Mn-Mn interlayer coupling is overwhelmed by the indirect ferromagnetic Mn-R-Mn
one, relieving frustration. This generates interesting anomalous Hall
conductivity, but not THE. Here we show that Er lies in an intermediate regime
where direct and indirect interactions closely compete, so that ErMn6Sn6 can
switch from one regime to the other by temperature, i.e., from a collinear
ferrimagnetic ground state to a spiral antiferromagnet at 78 K. The AFM phase
forms a dome in the temperature-field phase diagram. Close to the boundary of
this dome, we find a sizable fluctuations-driven THE, thus underscoring the
universality of this mechanism for generating non-zero scalar spin chirality.

<h3>Hysteresis and effective reciprocity breaking due to current-induced  forces</h3>

<br>
<i>Erika L. Mehring, Raúl A. Bustos-Marún, Hernán L. Calvo</i>
<p>Directed transport is a key concept for many ongoing applications including
nanoscale heat management, current rectification, source protection, and energy
harvesting. Within the context of quantum transport, we here explore the use of
nonlinear effects introduced by current-induced forces (CIFs) as a practical
way to effectively break charge and heat transport reciprocities. In
particular, we consider a simple model consisting of a mobile quantum dot (QD)
coupled to two leads, where the charge (or heat) current develops an asymmetric
behavior under inversion of voltage (or temperature) bias, thereby turning the
system into a quantum diode (or quantum thermal diode). Furthermore, we find
multiple stable positions for the QD and we show how the extraction of useful
work is possible by modulating the nonequilibrium sources along
well-established hysteresis loops. Finally, we explore a particular case where
the nonlinearity of the CIFs can be exploited to pump heat or charge, even for
systems that preserve inversion symmetry. This counterintuitive result is
attributed to a spontaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry due to the
intrinsic system's dynamics.

<h3>DC electric field-driven discretization of single-particle excitation  spectra in the Mott insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Koudai Sugimoto</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate the single-particle excitation spectra of a
one-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling using an infinite matrix-product
state and elucidate the discretized energy spectra emerging under the influence
of a dc electric field. In a weak electric-field regime, there are two kinds of
discretized spectral structures, which affect the spectra of the dynamical
current-current correlation function and the density of states. With increasing
the electric-field strength, the discretized spectra, whose period is
proportional to the strength, become dominant, and the density of states
exhibits the Wannier-Stark ladder in their spectra. To demonstrate how our
findings can be observed in experiments, we simulate time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy using an ultrashort THz pump pulse. Our results
represent a significant step forward in understanding the states in strongly
correlated electron systems driven by a static electric field.

<h3>A universal pairing gap measurement proposal by dynamical excitations in  2D doped attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with spin-orbit coupling</h3>

<i>Huaisong Zhao, Rui Han, Ling Qin, Feng Yuan, Peng Zou</i>
<p>By calculating dynamical structure factor of two-dimensional doped attractive
Fermi-Hubbard model with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we not only investigate
collective modes and single-particle excitations of the system during the phase
transition between Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid and topological
superfluid, but also propose a universal method to measure pairing gap
measurement in an optical lattice system. Our numerical results show that the
area of the molecular excitation peak at the transferred momentum ${\bf
q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$ is proportional to the square of the pairing gap in
the system with Rashba SOC. In particular, this method is very sensitive to the
pairing gap. This goes on verifying that this method is universal to measure
the pairing gap in a doped optical lattice with Rashba SOC. These theoretical
results are important for experimentally measuring the pairing gap and studying
the topological superfluid in an optical lattice.

<h3>Cavitation in Electron Fluids and the Puzzles of Photoemission Spectra  in Alkali Metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17492" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17492</a>
<br>
<i>Roman Dmitriev, Jenny Green, Vassiliy Lubchenko</i>
<p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectra of alkali metals exhibit a puzzling,
non-dispersing peak in the apparent density of states near the Fermi energy. We
argue that the holes left behind a significant fraction of photoejected
electrons are not wavepacket-like objects used to describe excitations of an
equilibrium Fermi liquid but, instead, are relatively localized entities
resulting from a photon-induced cavitation in the electron fluid. At the same
time, these special localized holes can be thought of as vacancies in a
transient Wigner solid. The corresponding contribution to the photoemission
current is non-dispersive and is tied to the Fermi level; it exhibits certain
similarities to photoemission from localized core orbitals such as the presence
of recoil currents. Calculated spectra are consistent with experiment. We
briefly discuss the present findings in the context of quantum measurement.

<br>
<i>N. Kvitka, H.V. Ovcharenko, Z.A. Maizelis, S.S. Apostolov, V.A. Yampol`skii</i>
<p>We develop a theory of the propagation and focusing of the THz Gaussian laser
beam through the layered superconductor slab of finite thickness in the
presence of an external DC magnetic field in a nonlinear regime. We show that,
in this case, focusing of radiation, which results from the specific
nonlinearity of the medium, can be flexibly tuned by the external magnetic
field providing a new way to control THz waves. We analytically study the main
characteristics of the Gaussian beam, its waist, and the focusing distance as
the functions of wave frequency, amplitude, and the external magnetic field.
The results of analytic calculations are supported by the numerical simulation
of the electromagnetic field distribution in the slab.

<br>
<i>Yu Zou, Satoshi Aya</i>
<p>Polar nematic liquid crystals are new classes of condensed-matter states
where the inversion symmetry common to the traditional apolar nematics is
broken. Establishing theoretical descriptions for the novel phase states is an
urgent task. Here, we develop a Landau-type mean-field theory for both the
achiral and chiral ferroelectric nematics. In the polar nematic states, the
inversion symmetry breaking adds two new contributions: an additional odd
elastic term (corresponding to the flexoelectricity in symmetry) to the
standard Oseen-Frank free energy and an additional Landau term relating to the
gradient of local polarisation. As a general necessity, the coupling between
the scalar order parameter and polarisation order is further considered. In the
chiral and polar nematic state, we reveal that the competition between the
twist elasticity and polarity dictates effective compressive energy arising
from the quasi-layer structure. The polarisation gradient is an essential term
for describing the ferroelectric nature of the systems. The approaches provide
theoretical foundations for testing and predicting polar structures in emerging
polar liquid crystals.

<h3>On-the-fly training of polynomial machine learning potentials in  computing lattice thermal conductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17531</a>
<br>
<i>Atsushi Togo, Atsuto Seko</i>
<p>The application of first-principles calculations for predicting lattice
thermal conductivity (LTC) in crystalline materials, in conjunction with the
linearized phonon Boltzmann equation, has gained increasing popularity. In this
calculation, the determination of force constants through first-principles
calculations is critical for accurate LTC predictions. For material
exploration, performing first-principles LTC calculations in a high-throughput
manner is now expected, although it requires significant computational
resources. To reduce computational demands while preserving accuracy
moderately, we integrated polynomial machine learning potentials on-the-fly
during the first-principles LTC calculations. This paper presents a systematic
approach to first-principles LTC calculations. We designed and optimized an
efficient workflow that integrates multiple modular software packages. We
applied this approach to calculate LTCs for 103 compounds of the wurtzite,
zincblende, and rocksalt types to evaluate the performance of the polynomial
machine learning potentials in LTC calculations. We demonstrate a significant
reduction in the computational resources required for the LTC predictions,
while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

<br>
<i>Shoei Sano, Takashi Yasuda, Takeshi Fujiyabu, Naoyuki Sakumichi, Takamasa Sakai</i>
<p>The swelling kinetics of charged polymer gels reflect the complex competition
among elastic, mixing, and ionic contributions. Here, we used dynamic light
scattering to investigate the collective diffusion coefficient of model gels,
whose polymer network structure was controlled so that the three contributions
were comparable. We demonstrate that the collective diffusion coefficient stems
from the sum of elastic, mixing, and ionic contributions, without evident
cross-correlations. The significant ionic contribution conforms to the Donnan
equilibrium, which explains equilibrium electrical potential gradients in
biological systems.

<h3>Impurity effects in one dimensional spin nematic liquid</h3>

<br>
<i>Fumiya Nakamura, Yasuhiro Tada</i>
<p>We study impurity effects in the spin nematic phase of the $S=1/2$
$J_1$-$J_2$ frustrated spin chain under an external magnetic field by using the
infinite density matrix renormalization group and the bosonization. It is found
that local magnetization almost saturates around the impurity and the
entanglement entropy nearly vanishes at the corresponding bonds, not only when
the magnetic interactions near the impurity are weakened but also when they are
strengthened compared to those in the bulk. Then, we examine spin correlations
and Friedel oscillations induced by the impurity. The bosonization provides a
qualitative understanding of the characteristic behaviors of the magnetization.
We also discuss impacts of the impurity on experiments by focusing on NMR
spectra.

<h3>Phase Transition of the single-layer vanadium diselenide on Au(111) with  distinguished electronic structures</h3>

<br>
<i>Jinbang Hu, Xiansi Wang, Chaoqin Huang, Fei Song, Justin W Wells</i>
<p>Herein, we report the reversible structure transition of the single-layer
VSe2 grown on Au (111) with the alternating thermal annealing and Se
replenishment. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we demonstrate the epitaxially growth of
high-quality VSe2 on Au (1 1 1) with the octahedral (1T) structure and the
Se-vacancy-induced structure transformation of VSe2 from the metallic Morrie
(1T) phase to the semiconducting (2H) phase with an increased in-plane lattice
constant. With the convincing agreement between the experimental results and
DFT calculations, the nanostructure near the gain boundary in the defective
intermediate phase is confirmed, as well as the reaction pathway with Se
gradually depleted at elevated temperatures. It is revealed that the Se density
of the line-shape defects plays an important role in the formation of the 2H
domain phase, due to the increment of the in-plane lattice parameter after the
Se desorption, and the better thermal stability of 2H phase compared to the 1T
phase. Importantly, the proper control of the density of Se could feasibly
manipulate the ratio between the 1T and 2H phase in the steak domain, which is
regard as a good platform for the 2D homojunctions in nanoelectronics.

<h3>Biorthogonal topological charge pumping in non-Hermitian systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17564" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17564</a>
<br>
<i>Zhenming Zhang, Tianyu Li, Xiwang Luo, Wei Yi</i>
<p>We study charge pumping in generic non-Hermitian settings, and show that
quantized charge pumping is only guaranteed under a biorthogonal formalism
therein, where the charge transport is evaluated using the left and right
eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Specifically, for biorthogonal
charge pumping in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian models, we demonstrate
how quantized transport is related to the Chern number in the parameter space.
When the non-Hermitian model possesses the non-Hermitian skin effect, under
which Bloch states in the bulk are deformed and localize toward boundaries, we
propose a scenario where the pumped charge is related to the non-Bloch Chern
number defined in the parameter space involving the generalized Brillouin zone.
We illustrate the validity of our analytic results using concrete examples,
and, in the context of the biorthogonal charge pumping, discuss in detail a
recent experiment where quantized charge pumping was observed in a lossy
environment.

<h3>Dissipative particle dynamics simulation plus slip-springs for entangled  polymers with various slip-spring densities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17565" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17565</a>
<br>
<i>Yuichi Masubuchi, Hong-Xia Guo, Fan Wang, Bamim Khomami, Mahdi Boudaghi-Khajehnobar, Yuya Doi, Takato Ishida, Takashi Uneyama</i>
<p>Slip-spring models are valuable tools for simulating entangled polymers,
bridging the gap between bead-spring models with excluded volume and network
models with presumed reptation motion. This study focuses on the DPD-SS
(Dissipative Particle Dynamics - Slip-Spring) model, which introduces
slip-springs into the standard DPD polymer model with soft-core interactions.
By systematically adjusting the fugacity of slip-springs, the density of
slip-springs within the system is varied. Simulation results demonstrate the
compatibility of models with different slip-spring densities in terms of
diffusion and linear relaxation modulus when the average number of slip-springs
per chain is the same. The conversion between DPD-SS models concerning length
and time is achieved through Rouse scaling, which utilizes the average number
of DPD beads between consecutive anchoring points of slip-springs.
Additionally, the modulus conversion is accomplished through the plateau
modulus that takes account of fluctuations around entanglement. Notably,
diffusion and relaxation modulus from the DPD-SS model align with those
reported for standard Kremer-Grest and DPD models featuring strong repulsive
interactions.

<h3>Magnetic Bloch oscillations in a non-Hermitian quantum Ising chain</h3>

<br>
<i>K. L. Zhang, Z. Song</i>
<p>We investigate the impacts of an imaginary transverse field on the dynamics
of magnetic domain walls in a quantum Ising chain. We show that an imaginary
field plays a similar role as a real transverse field in forming a low-lying
Wannier-Stark ladder. However, analytical and numerical calculations of the
time evolutions in both two systems show that the corresponding Bloch
oscillations exhibit totally different patterns for the same initial states.
These findings reveal the nontrivial effect of non-Hermiticity on quantum spin
dynamics.

<h3>A Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Hydrogen  Storage Capacities in Metal Hydrides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17587" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17587</a>
<br>
<i>Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Pritam Das, Swetarekha Ram, Seung-Cheol Lee</i>
<p>In this study, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning approach to
address the challenges of limited data availability and high feature
dimensionality in predicting hydrogen storage capacity for metal hydrides. Our
method uses an autoencoder to create a low-dimensional latent space from
elementary features obtained using Mendeleev software. This latent space is
then used by a multi-layer perceptron model (MLP) to predict hydrogen storage
capacity. In an exploratory step, we examined the effectiveness of transferring
weights from the autoencoder to the MLP in addition to the latent features.
Despite slightly higher $R^2$ value and lower RMSE, the results do not
significantly improve prediction accuracy. This highlights the importance of
the challenges of tailoring pre-trained weights to specific supervised tasks.
Finally, we apply our method to a set of materials predicted using a large
language model and to some materials that we select from the target's Pearson
correlation with physically meaningful features to demonstrate the predictive
power of our approach.

<i>Shao-Pin Chiu, Chang-Jan Wang, Yi-Chun Lin, Shun-Tast Tu, Shouray Sahu, Ruey-Tay Wang, Chih-Yuan Wu, Sheng-Shiuan Yeh, Stefan Kirchner, Juhn-Jong Lin</i>
<p>We report observations of unusual normal-state electronic conduction
properties and superconducting characteristics of high-quality CoSi$_2$/Si
films grown on silicon Si(100) and Si(111) substrates. A good understanding of
these features shall help to address the underlying physics of the
unconventional pairing symmetry recently observed in transparent
CoSi$_2$/TiSi$_2$ heterojunctions [S. P. Chiu \textit{et al.}, Sci. Adv.
\textbf{7}, eabg6569 (2021); Nanoscale \textbf{15}, 9179 (2023)], where
CoSi$_2$/Si is a superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature
$T_c \simeq$ (1.1--1.5) K, dependent on its dimensions, and TiSi$_2$ is a
normal metal. In CoSi$_2$/Si films, we find a pronounced positive
magnetoresistance caused by the weak-antilocalization effect, indicating a
strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This SOC generates two-component
superconductivity in CoSi$_2$/TiSi$_2$ heterojunctions. The CoSi$_2$/Si films
are stable under ambient conditions and have ultralow 1/$f$ noise. Moreover,
they can be patterned via the standard lithography techniques, which might be
of considerable practical value for future scalable superconducting and quantum
device fabrication.

<br>
<i>Seongjun Mo, Jaeuk Seo, Seok-Kyun Son, Sejoong Kim, Jun-Won Rhim, Hoonkyung Lee</i>
<p>We propose a new band engineering scheme on the biphenylene network, a newly
synthesized carbon allotrope. First, we investigate the mechanism for the
appearance of type II Dirac fermion in a pristine biphenylene network. We show
that the essential ingredients are mirror symmetries and the stabilization of
the compact localized eigenstates via destructive interference. While the
former is used for the band-crossing point along high symmetry lines, the
latter makes the obtained Dirac dispersion highly inclined. Then, we
demonstrate that many other different kinds of Dirac fermions, such as type-I
Dirac, gapped type-II Dirac, and nodal line semimetals, can be developed by
fluorinating the biphenylene network periodically in various ways. In this
program, the key role of the fluorine atoms is manipulating the condition of
the destructive interference and mirror symmetries.

<p>Antiferromagnetic spintronics have attracted wide attention due to its great
potential in constructing ultra-dense and ultra-fast antiferromagnetic memory
that suits modern high-performance information technology. The electrical 180o
switching of N\'eel vector is a long-term goal for developing
electrical-controllable antiferromagnetic memory with opposite N\'eel vectors
as binary "0" and "1". However, the state-of-art antiferromagnetic switching
mechanisms have long been limited for 90o or 120o switching of N\'eel vector,
which unavoidably require multiple writing channels that contradicts
ultra-dense integration. Here, we propose a deterministic switching mechanism
based on spin-orbit torque with asymmetric energy barrier, and experimentally
achieve electrical 180o switching of spin-splitting antiferromagnet Mn5Si3.
Such a 180o switching is read out by the N\'eel vector-induced anomalous Hall
effect. Based on our writing and readout methods, we fabricate an
antiferromagnet device with electrical-controllable high and low resistance
states that accomplishes robust write and read cycles. Besides fundamental
advance, our work promotes practical spin-splitting antiferromagnetic devices
based on spin-splitting antiferromagnet.

<i>Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer</i>
<p>We investigate the effect of random defect scattering on the orbital Hall
effect by solving a quantum Boltzmann equation. Depending on the specific
orbital textures, diffuse scattering by an \emph{arbitrarily} weak disorder can
affect and even fully suppress an intrinsic orbital Hall current. From the
results for a simple model, we infer that disorder can play an important role
in orbitronics in general.

<i>Longfei Li, Shuyue Guan, Shengwei Chi, Jiawei Li, Xinxuan Lin, Gang Xu, Shuang Jia</i>
<p>The anomalous Hall and Nernst effects describe the voltage drop perpendicular
to an applied current and temperature gradient due to the magnetization of a
magnetic material. These effects can be utilized to measure the Berry curvature
at the Fermi energy, and have potential applications in future electronic
devices and thermoelectric energy conversion. In this paper, we report giant
anomalous Hall conductivity and anomalous Nernst coefficient, as high as about
1000 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and 10 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$, respectively, in a heavy
fermion ferromagnet, CeCrGe$_3$. This compound uniquely manifests strong
hybridization between the 4$f$ and conduction electrons, leading to a Kondo
lattice state in the presence of ferromagnetic order. Unlike conventional
topological semimetals in which the electron correlation is weak, CeCrGe$_3$
manifests a strong Berry curvature field of the heavy fermion with an extremely
low Fermi energy. Our findings pave the way for exploring correlation-driven
topological responses in a ferromagnetic Kondo lattice environment.

<i>Luqman Saleem, Udo Schwingenschlogl, Aurelien Manchon</i>
<p>We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for systems subjected to a
static uniform temperature gradient, employing the non-equilibrium
Keldysh-Dyson formalism. This framework interprets the statistical force due to
the temperature gradient as a mechanical force, utilizing both Luttinger's
scalar and Moreno-Coleman-Tatara's vector potentials, which collectively
emulate the gauge invariance stemming from the conservation of energy. Our
approach has the ability to treat heat current and heat magnetization on an
equal footing, thereby extending and generalizing previous formalisms. The
derived result for the thermal conductivity is applied to investigate the
thermal characteristics of Weyl magnons in a stacked honeycomb ferromagnet
featuring a trivial insulator phase, a magnon Chern insulator phase, and three
Weyl magnon phases. Against the expectation from the Berry curvature, the
magnon Chern insulator phase exhibits the highest transverse thermal
conductivity.

<p>The corrosion-fatigue strength in 3% aqueous NaCl solution and the resistance
against hot salt corrosion (HSC) of the fine-grained near-a alloy Ti-5Al-2V
(Russian analog of Grade 9 titanium alloy with increased aluminum content) has
been studied. The properties of the Ti-5Al-2V alloy in the coarse-grained
state, in the fine-grained after cold Rotary Swaging (RS), in partly
recrystallized state, and in fully recrystallized one have been investigated.
The mechanical properties of the alloy were characterized using compression
tests and microhardness measurements. The effects of RS and of the annealing
temperature and time on the character of corrosion destruction of the surface
and on the composition of the products of the HSC were studied. RS was shown to
result in an increase in the depth of the intergranular corrosion defects while
the recrystallization annealing promotes the increasing of the corrosion
resistance of the Ti-5Al-2V titanium alloy. The parameters of the Basquin
equation for the corrosion-fatigue curves for the near-a Ti-5Al-2V alloy in the
coarse-grained state, in the severely strained one, and after recrystallization
annealing were determined for the first time. An effect of nonmonotonous
dependencies of the slopes of the corrosion-fatigue curves for the strained
near-a Ti-5Al-2V alloy on the recrystallization annealing temperature has been
observed.

<i>Ignacio Sardinero, Rubén Seoane Souto, Pablo Burset</i>
<p>Topological superconductors are appealing building blocks for robust and
reliable quantum information processing. Most platforms for engineering
topological superconductivity rely on a combination of superconductors,
materials with intrinsic strong spin-orbit coupling, and external magnetic
fields, detrimental for superconductivity. We propose a setup where a
conventional Josephson junction is linked via a magnetic-textured barrier.
Antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic insulators with periodically arranged
domains are compatible with our proposal which does not require intrinsic
spin-orbit or external magnetic fields. We find that the topological phase
depends on the magnitude and period of the barrier magnetization. The
superconducting phase controls the topological transition, which could be
detected as a sharp suppression of the supercurrent across the junction.

<p>The research aims to analyze the impact that severe plastic deformation
arising during Rotary Swaging has on mechanical properties and corrosion
resistance of a near-a-titanium alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr (Russian industrial name
PT7M). The nature of corrosion decay in fine-grained alloys caused by hot salt
corrosion is known to vary from pit corrosion to intercrystalline corrosion at
the onset of recrystallization processes. Resistance to hot salt corrosion in a
fine-grained titanium alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr is shown to depend on the
structural-phase state of grain boundaries that varies during their migration
as a result of covering corrosive doping elements (aluminum, zirconium)
distributed in the crystal lattice of a titanium alloy.

<p>The study focuses on corrosion fatigue processes taking place in an
ultrafine-grained (UFG) near-a-titanium alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr (Russian
industrial name PT7M) used in nuclear engineering. UFG structure formed with
Rotary Swaging is found to increase resistance to corrosion fatigue. Parameters
of the Basquin's equation are defined and the slope of the fatigue curve
Sa-lg(N) is shown to depend (nonmonotonic dependence) on the UFG alloy
annealing temperature. This effect can be explained with the patterns of
microstructural evolution in a UFG alloy PT7M during annealing: (1) reduced
density of lattice dislocations, (2) precipitation and dissolution of zirconium
nanoparticles, (3) release of a''-phase particles causing internal stress
fields along interphase (a-a'')-boundaries, and (4) intensive grain growth at
elevated annealing temperatures. It is shown that the fatigue crack closure
effect manifested as changing internal stress fields determined using XRD
method may be observed in UFG titanium alloys.

<i>Yong-Cheng Jiang, Toshikaze Kariyado, Xiao Hu</i>
<p>We investigate higher-order topological states in honeycomb lattice with
Y-Kekul\'e distortions that preserve $C_{6v}$ crystalline symmetry. The gapped
states in expanded and shrunken distortions are adiabatically connected to
isolated hexamers and Y-shaped tetramer states, respectively, where the former
possesses nontrivial higher-order topology characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_6$
invariant. Topological corner states exist in a flake structure with expanded
distortion where the hexamers are broken at the corners. Our work reveals that
honeycomb lattice with Y-Kekul\'e distortions serves as a promising platform to
study higher-order topological states.

<p>The paper demonstrates the prospects of Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) for the
high-speed diffusion welding of the high-strength ultrafine-grained (UFG)
near-a Ti-5Al-2V alloy. The effect of increased diffusion welding intensity in
the UFG Ti alloys is discussed also. The welds of the UFG near-a-Ti-5Al-2V
alloy obtained by SPS are featured by high density, strength, and corrosion
resistance. The rate of weld sealing in the UFG alloys has been shown to depend
on the heating rate non-monotonously (with a pronounced maximum). At the stage
of continuous heating and isothermic holding, the kinetics of the weld sealing
was found to be determined by the exponential creep rate, the intensity of
which in the coarse-grained (CG) alloys is limited by the diffusion rate in the
crystal lattice whereas in the UFG alloys it is limited by the grain boundary
diffusion rate.

Recently, this classical targeting has been generalized to quantum systems
either by periodically countering the inevitable quantum state spreading or by
introducing a control Hamiltonian, where both enable localized states to be
guided along special chaotic trajectories toward any of a broad variety of
desired target states. Only strictly unitary dynamics are involved; i.e., it
gives a coherent quantum targeting. In this paper, the introduction of a
control Hamiltonian is applied to Bose-Hubbard systems in chaotic dynamical
regimes. Properly selected unstable mean field solutions can be followed quite
rapidly to states possessing precise phase relationships and occupancies. In
essence, the method generates a quantum simulation technique that can access
rather special states. The protocol reduces to a time-dependent control of the
chemical potentials, opening up the possibility for application in optical
lattice experiments. Explicit applications to custom state preparation and
stabilization of quantum many-body scars are presented in one- and
two-dimensional lattices (three-dimensional applications are similarly
possible).

<p>Interaction of excitons with resident charge carriers in semiconductors gives
rise to bound three-particle complexes, trions, whose optical response is
conveniently described in the framework of many-body correlated Fermi polaron
states. These states are formed as a result of correlation of photocreated
trion with the Fermi sea hole and possess the angular momentum component of
$\pm 1$ depending on the helicity of the photon. We study theoretically the
energy spectrum fine structure of Fermi polarons in two-dimensional
semiconductors based on transition metal dichalcogenides. We demonstrate both
by the symmetry analysis and microscopic calculation that the Fermi polarons
with nonzero in-plane wavevector $\bf k$ are split, similarly to the neutral
exciton states, into the linearly polarized longitudinal and transverse, with
respect to the $\bf k$, states. The origin of this longitudinal-transverse
splitting is the long-range electron-hole exchange interaction that can be also
described as the interaction of Fermi polarons with their induced
electromagnetic field. The effective Hamiltonian describing the Fermi polaron
fine structure is derived, and its parameters are determined from the
microscopic model.

<p>Understanding active matter has led to new perspectives on biophysics and
non-equilibrium dynamics. However, the development of numerical tools for
simulating active fluids capable of incorporating non-trivial boundaries or
inclusions has lagged behind. Active particle-based methods, which typically
excel at this, suffer from large density fluctuations that affect the dynamics
of inclusions. To this end, we advance the Active-Nematic Multi-Particle
Collision Dynamics algorithm, a particle-based method for simulating active
nematics, by addressing the large density fluctuations that arise from
activity. This paper introduces three novel activity formulations that mitigate
the coupling between activity and local density. Local density fluctuations are
decreased to a level comparable to the passive limit while retaining the
phenomenology of active nematics and increasing the active turbulence regime
four-fold. These developments extend the technique into a flexible tool for
modeling active systems, including solutes and inclusions, with broad
applications for the study of biophysical systems.

<h3>Identification of graphite with perfect rhombohedral stacking by  electronic Raman scattering</h3>

<i>András Pálinkás, Krisztián Márity, Konrád Kandrai, Zoltán Tajkov, Martin Gmitra, Péter Vancsó, Levente Tapasztó, Péter Nemes-Incze</i>
<p>Rhombohedral graphite (RG) shows strong correlations in its topological flat
band and is pivotal for exploring emergent, correlated electronic phenomena.
Its key advantage is the enhancement of electronic interactions with the
increase in the number of rhombohedrally stacked graphene layers. Increasing
thickness also leads to an exponential increase in the number of stacking
faults, necessitating a precise method to identify flawless rhombohedral
stacking. Overcoming this challenge is difficult because the established
technique for stacking sequence identification, based on the 2D peak, fails in
thick RG samples. We demonstrate that the strong layer dependence of the band
structure can be harnessed to identify RG without stacking faults, or
alternatively, to detect their presence. For thicknesses ranging from 3 to 12
layers, we show that each perfect RG structure presents distinctive peak
positions in electronic Raman scattering (ERS). This measurement can be carried
out using a conventional confocal Raman spectrometer at room temperature, using
visible excitation wavelengths. Consequently, this overcomes the identification
challenge by employing a simple and fast optical measurement technique, thereby
helping to establish RG as a platform for studying strong correlations in one
of the simplest crystals possible.

<i>Siyu Liu, Tongqi Wen, A. S. L. Subrahmanyam Pattamatta, David J. Srolovitz</i>
<p>With the advent of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
considerable progress across a wide array of domains. Owing to the extensive
number of parameters and training data in LLMs, these models inherently
encompass an expansive and comprehensive materials knowledge database, far
exceeding the capabilities of individual researcher. Nonetheless, devising
methods to harness the knowledge embedded within LLMs for the design and
discovery of novel materials remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we
introduce a general approach for addressing materials classification problems,
which incorporates LLMs, prompt engineering, and deep learning algorithms.
Utilizing a dataset of metallic glasses as a case study, our methodology
achieved an improvement of up to 463% in prediction accuracy compared to
conventional classification models. These findings underscore the potential of
leveraging textual knowledge generated by LLMs for materials especially with
sparse datasets, thereby promoting innovation in materials discovery and

<h3>Dimensional Analysis Theory and Molecular Dynamics Simulation of  Polypropylene Melt Flow during Injection Molding Process</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17792" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17792</a>
<br>
<i>Jinrong Zhang, Dadong Yan, Li Peng, Xianbo Huang</i>
<p>Flow marks are common surface defects that occur in injection-molded
products. Their formation may be related to the flow process of the melt in the
mold. Through dimensional analysis, we have discovered that the geometric shape
of the flow field is controlled by specific dimensionless quantities. These
quantities can be summarized as follows: geometric dimensionless quantities
related to the shape of the mold, material dimensionless quantities related to
the melt and mold materials, and physical dimensionless quantities related to
the flow. When the geometric shape of the mold changes proportionally, with the
melt and mold material fixed, and the initial temperature of the melt and mold
fixed, the geometric shape of the flow field will be solely controlled by the
Weissenberg number Wi. If Wi is kept constant, changing the injection speed,
changing the relaxation time of the polypropylene melt, or scaling the mold
will result in similar geometric shapes of the flow field. If the size of the
mold is not changed, the geometric shape of the flow field will be the same.
Since the dimensionless equation represents a similar system of all sizes, we
verified the above conclusion through molecular dynamics simulations at a
smaller scale. After further improvement of the micro simulation system, there
is a possibility of visualizing the formation process of flow marks. This would
greatly aid in the advancement of theory and the elimination of flow marks in
production and experiments. This work also illustrates that the methodology of
dimensional analysis plus molecular dynamics simulation may be applied to a
wider range of other systems, scaling down large systems and thus significantly
reducing their computational effort.

<h3>Self-Aligning Active Agents with Inertia and Active Torque</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17798" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17798</a>
<br>
<i>Jeremy Fersula, Nicolas Bredeche, Olivier Dauchot</i>
<p>We extend the study of the inertial effects on the dynamics of active agents
to the case where self-alignment is present. In contrast with the most common
models of active particles, we find that self-alignment, which couples the
rotational dynamics to the translational one, produces unexpected and
non-trivial dynamics, already at the deterministic level. Examining first the
motion of a free particle, we contrast the role of inertia depending on the
sign of the self-aligning torque. When positive, inertia does not alter the
steady-state linear motion of an a-chiral self-propelled particle. On the
contrary, for a negative self-aligning torque, inertia leads to the
destabilization of the linear motion into a spontaneously broken chiral
symmetry orbiting dynamics. Adding an active torque, or bias, to the angular
dynamics the bifurcation becomes imperfect in favor of the chiral orientation
selected by the bias. In the case of a positive self-alignment, the interplay
of the active torque and inertia leads to the emergence, out of a saddle-node
bifurcation, of truly new solutions, which coexist with the simply biased
linear motion. In the context of a free particle, the rotational inertia leaves
unchanged the families of steady-state solutions but can modify their stability
properties. The situation is radically different when considering the case of a
collision with a wall, where a very singular oscillating dynamics takes place
which can only be captured if both translational and rotational inertia are
present.

<p>Nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) holds immense significance in recognizing the
band geometry and its potential applications in current rectification. Recent
discoveries have expanded the study from second-order to third-order nonlinear
Hall effect (THE), which is governed by an intrinsic band geometric quantity
called the Berry Connection Polarizability (BCP) tensor. Here we demonstrate a
giant THE in a misfit layer compound, (SnS)${1.17}$(NbS$_2$)$_3$. While the THE
is prohibited in individual NbS$_2$ and SnS due to the constraints imposed by
the crystal symmetry and their band structures, a remarkable THE emerges when a
superlattice is formed by introducing a monolayer of SnS. The angular-dependent
THE and its scaling relationship indicate that the phenomenon could be
correlated to the band geometry modulation, concurrently with the symmetry
breaking. The resulting strength of THE is orders of magnitude higher compared
to recent studies. Our work illuminates the modulation of structural and
electronic geometries for novel quantum phenomena through interface
engineering.

<h3>Phase diagram of the interacting Haldane model with spin-dependent  sublattice potentials</h3>

<br>
<i>Can Shao, Hong-Gang Luo</i>
<p>Using the exact-diagonalization (ED) and mean-field (MF) approaches, we study
the ground-state phase diagram of the interacting Haldane model on the
honeycomb lattice, taking into consideration of the spin-dependent sublattice
potentials $\Delta_{\sigma,\alpha}$. Here $\alpha=\text{A}$,$\text{B}$ and
$\sigma=\uparrow$,$\downarrow$ indicate the sublattice and spin components,
respectively. If we set $\Delta_{\sigma,\text{A}}=+\Delta$ ($-\Delta$) and
$\Delta_{\sigma,\text{B}}$$=-\Delta$ ($+\Delta$) for $\sigma=\uparrow$
($\downarrow$), the system favors a spin ordered state. On the other hand,
introducing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction $V$ can drive the system
to be charge ordered. Due to their competition, we find that in both ED and MF
approaches, an exotic state with Chern number $C=1$ survives from two locally
ordered phases and a topologically ordered phase with $C=2$. In ED method,
other properties, including the fidelity metric, the excitation gap and the
structure factors, are also used to determine the critical points. In MF method
with large enough lattice size, we define the local order parameters and band
gap to characterize the phase transitions. The interacting Haldane model and
the spin-dependent lattice potential can be realized in an ultracold atom gas,
which may serve as a way to detect this intriguing state.

<h3>Exciton-phonon coupling induces new pathway for ultrafast  intralayer-to-interlayer exciton transition and interlayer charge transfer in  WS2-MoS2 heterostructure: a first-principles study</h3>

<br>
<i>Yang-hao Chan, Mit H. Naik, Jonah B. Haber, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Steven G. Louie, Diana Y. Qiu, Felipe H. da Jornada</i>
<p>Despite the weak, van-der-Waals interlayer coupling, photoinduced charge
transfer vertically across atomically thin interfaces can occur within
surprisingly fast, sub-50fs timescales. Early theoretical understanding of the
charge transfer is based on a noninteracting picture, neglecting excitonic
effects that dominate the optical properties of such materials. Here, we employ
an ab initio many-body perturbation theory approach which explicitly accounts
for the excitons and phonons in the heterostructure. Our large-scale
first-principles calculations directly probe the role of exciton-phonon
coupling in the charge dynamics of the WS$_2$/MoS$_2$ heterobilayer. We find
that the exciton-phonon interaction induced relaxation time of photo-excited
excitons at the $K$ valley of MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ is 67 fs and 15 fs at 300 K,
respectively, which sets a lower bound to the intralayer-to-interlayer exciton
transfer time and is consistent with experiment reports. We further show that
electron-hole correlations facilitate novel transfer pathways which are
otherwise inaccessible to non-interacting electrons and holes.

<p>In recent years, GW-BSE has been proven to be extremely successful in
studying the quasiparticle (QP) bandstructures and excitonic effects in the
optical properties of materials. However, the massive computational cost
associated with such calculations restricts their applicability in
high-throughput material discovery studies. Recently, we developed a Python
workflow package, $py$GWBSE, to perform high-throughput GW-BSE simulations. In
this work, using $py$GWBSE we create a database of various QP properties and
excitonic properties of over 350 chemically and structurally diverse materials.
Despite the relatively small size of the dataset, we obtain highly accurate
supervised machine learning (ML) models via the dataset. The models predict the
quasiparticle gap with an RMSE of 0.36 eV, exciton binding energies of
materials with an RMSE of 0.29 eV, and classify materials as high or low
excitonic binding energy materials with classification accuracy of 90%. We
exemplify the application of these ML models in the discovery of 159
visible-light and 203 ultraviolet-light photoabsorber materials utilizing the

<p>As the most important solvent, water has been at the center of interest since

way to predictive simulations of aqueous systems. Still, these simulations are
very demanding, which prevents the study of complex systems and their
properties. Modern machine learning potentials (MLPs) have now reached a mature

electronic structure calculations with the efficiency of empirical force
fields. In this Perspective we give a concise overview about the progress made

<i>Shuohang Wu, Zhengxin Guo, Zi Cai</i>
<p>In this study, we show that the quantum critical point in the ground state of
quantum many-body systems, can also govern the universal dynamical behavior
when the systems are driven far from equilibrium, which can be captured by the
evolution of the quantum geometry of the systems. By investigating quantum
quench dynamics in a variety of quadratic fermionic models, we find that the
quantum volume of these systems typically grows linearly over time, with a
growth velocity demonstrating universal behavior: its first derivative over the
control parameter exhibits a discontinuity at the quantum critical point, with
an universal jump value that is independent of specific models, but is
crucially determined by the system dimension. This result reveals universal
dynamical properties of non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

<p>The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals
complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity,
and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually
incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction which includes an
ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents. We show that all these
features can emerge from a minimal two-dimensional model where particles
interact isotropically by a double-well potential, and have an excluded volume
and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns
shown by this simple model apply to a wide catalogue of real systems including

<p>We demonstrate the use of quantum annealing for the selection of multiple
martensite variants in a microstructure with long-range coherency stresses and
external mechanical load. The general approach is illustrated for martensites
with four different variants, based on the minimization of the linear elastic
energy. The equilibrium variant distribution is then analysed under application
of tensile and shear strains and for different values of the considered shear
and tetragonal contributions of the different martensite variants. The
interface orientations between different domains of variants can be explained
using the perspective of the elastic energy anisotropy for regular stripe
patterns. For random grain orientations, the response to an external elastic
strain is weaker and variants changes can be interpreted based on the rotated
eigenstrain tensor.

<i>Xin-Xin Yang, Wei Zhang, Zhen-Xia Niu</i>
<p>The existence and dynamics of stable quantized vortices is an important
subject of quantum many-body physics. Spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling
(SOAMC), a special type of spin-orbit coupling, has been experimentally
achieved to create vortices in atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we
generalize the concept of SOAMC to a two-component polariton BEC and analyze
the emergence and configuration of vortices under a finite-size circular
pumping. We discover that the regular configuration of vortex lattices induced
by a finite-size circular pump is significantly distorted by the spatially
dependent Raman coupling of SOAMC. Meanwhile, a vortex induced by SOAMC located
at the center of the polariton cloud remains stable and pinned in place. When
the Raman coupling is sufficiently strong, the polariton BEC with SOAMC is torn
apart to become fragmented.

<p>Optical properties of heterostructures composed of layered 2D materials, such
as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene, are broadly explored.
Of particular interest are light-induced energy transfer mechanisms in these
materials and their structural roots. Here, we use state-of-the-art
first-principles calculations to study the excitonic composition and the
absorption properties of WS$_2$-graphene heterostructures as a function of
interlayer alignment and the local strain resulting from it. We find that
Brillouin zone mismatch and the associated energy level alignment between the
graphene Dirac cone and the TMD bands dictate an interplay between interlayer
and intralayer excitons, mixing together in the many-body representation upon
the strain-induced symmetry breaking in the interacting layers. Examining the
representative cases of the 0$^\circ$ and 30$^\circ$ interlayer twist angles,
we find that this exciton mixing strongly varies as a function of the relative
alignment. We quantify the effect of these structural modifications on exciton
charge separation between the layers and the associated graphene-induced
homogeneous broadening of the absorption resonances. Our findings provide
guidelines for controllable optical excitations upon interface design and shed
light on the importance of many-body effects in the understanding of optical
phenomena in complex heterostructures.

<h3>Enhanced contact flexibility from nanoparticles in capillary suspensions</h3>

<br>
<i>Lingyue Liu, Jens Allard, Erin Koos</i>
<p>Capillary suspensions, which form sample-spanning particle networks, are
typically generated by introducing a small quantity of immiscible secondary
fluid to a suspension. Incorporating nanoparticles into the bridging fluid
influences the rheological properties and structural characteristics of the
paste, particularly under compression. In the absence of nanoparticles, the
rigid network resists compression, exhibiting minimal changes in the volume
fraction and structural parameters such as the coordination number and
clustering coefficient. In contrast, the sample with nanoparticles displays a
more flexible network that readily compacts, increasing both the volume
fraction and coordination number. Our hypothesis suggests that nanoparticles
induce thin liquid film formation on the surface of the microparticles,
mitigating contact line pinning effects and promoting internal liquid exchange.
Nanoparticles at microparticle contact regions further diminish Hertzian
contact, enhancing the capacity for rearrangement. These effects enhance
microparticle movement, narrowing the bridge size distribution.

<p>Inspired by emergent behaviors of living matter, there is increasing interest
in developing approaches to create dynamic patterns and structures in synthetic
materials with controllable complexity to enable functionalities that are not
possible in thermodynamic equilibrium. Here we show that electrophoretically
driven and maintained non-equilibrium gradients of magnetic nanoparticles in
non-polar solvent can undergo electrokinetic instabilities (EKI), leading to
various electrically controllable spatiotemporally patterned states. These
electrokinetic instabilities and patterns can be tuned with a magnetic field
via magnetostatic energy reduction mechanism to both increase and decrease the
pattern complexity. We reflect the experimental observations on the theoretical
electrokinetic and magnetostatic arguments. We further show that small amounts
of polar water in the otherwise non-polar system are critical enablers for the
electrophoretic mobility of the nanoparticles. Since functionalities of
magnetic nanoparticles are widely tunable, we foresee that the combination of
dissipative electrokinetic driving and magnetic energy reduction can lead to
novel functional dissipative materials.

<p>Recently, GaAsSb/GaAsN type II short-period superlattices (SLs) have been
proposed as suitable structures to be implemented in the optimal design of
monolithic multi-junction solar cells. However, due to strong surface Sb
segregation, experimental Sb composition profiles differ greatly from the
nominal square-wave design. In this work, the improvement of the interface
quality of these SLs in terms of compositional abruptness and surface roughness
has been evaluated by implementing different growth interruption times under
Sb4/As4 (soaking) and As4 (desorption) overpressure conditions before and after
the growth of GaAsSb layers, respectively. The combined effects of both
processes enhance Sb distribution, achieving squarer compositional profiles
with reduced surface roughness interfaces. It has been found that the
improvement in compositional abruptness is quantitatively much higher at the
lower interface, during soaking, than at the upper interface during desorption.
Conversely, a larger decrease in surface roughness is achieved at the upper
interface than at the lower interface. Fitting of the Sb segregation profiles
using the 3-layer kinetic fluid model has shown that the increase in Sb
incorporation rate is due to the decrease in segregation energy, presumably to
changes in the surface reconstruction of the floating layer at the surface.

<i>Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</i>
<p>The topological classification of energy bands has laid the groundwork for
the discovery of various topological phases of matter in recent decades. While
this classification has traditionally focused on real-energy bands, recent
studies have revealed the intriguing topology of complex-energy, or
non-Hermitian bands. For example, the spectral winding of complex-energy bands
can from unique topological structures like braids, holding promise for
advancing quantum computing. However, discussions of complex-energy braids have
been largely limited to the Abelian braid group $\mathbb{B}_2$ for its relative
simplicity, while identifying topological non-Abelian braiding is still
difficult since it has no universal topological invariant for characterization.
Here, we present a machine learning algorithm for the unsupervised
identification of non-Abelian braiding of multiple complex-energy bands. The
consistency with Artin's well-known topological equivalence conditions in
braiding is demonstrated. Inspired by the results from unsupervised learning,
we also introduce a winding matrix as a topological invariant in charactering
the braiding topology and unveiling the bulk-edge correspondence of non-Abelian
braided non-Hermitian bands. Finally, we extend our approach to identify
non-Abelian braiding topology in 2D/3D exceptional semimetals and successfully
address the unknotting problem in an unsupervised manner.

<i>Saheli Sarkar, Alexei M. Tsvelik</i>
<p>The search of anyons is a field of immense interest owing to its potential
application in the field of quantum information. Quantum critical Kondo
impurities present one possible platform for realization of anyons. In this
paper we discuss practical steps for realization of Topological Kondo effect
which, in contrast to the well known multichannel Kondo one, remains critical
even in the presence of perturbations.

<h3>Prediction of stable nanoscale skyrmions in monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</h3>

<i>Dongzhe Li, Soumyajyoti Haldar, Stefan Heinze</i>
<p>Using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we
predict stable isolated skyrmions with a diameter below 10 nm in a monolayer of
the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$, a material of
significant experimental interest. A very large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) is observed due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry
and strong spin-orbit coupling for monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$. We show that the
nearest-neighbor approximation, often used in literature, fails to describe the
DMI. The strong DMI together with moderate in-plane magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy allows to stabilize nanoscale skyrmions in out-of-plane
magnetic fields above $\approx 2$~T. The energy barriers of skyrmions in
monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ are comparable to those of state-of-the-art
transition-metal ultra-thin films. We further predict that these nanoscale
skyrmions can be stable for hours at temperatures up to 20 K.

<p>Tailoring the magnetic properties of iron oxide nanosystems is essential to
expand their biomedical applications. In this study, the 34 nm iron oxide
nanocubes with two phases consisting of Fe3O4 and alpha-Fe2O3 were annealed for
2 hours in the presence of O2, N2, He, and Ar to tune the respective phase
volume fractions and control the magnetic properties. X-ray diffraction and
magnetic measurements were carried out post-treatment to evaluate the changes
of the treated samples compared to the as-prepared, which showed an enhancement
of the alpha-Fe2O3 phase in the samples annealed with O2, while the others
indicated Fe3O4 enhancement. Furthermore, the latter samples indicated
enhancements in the crystallinity and saturation magnetization while coercivity
enhancement was most significant in the samples annealed with O2, resulting in
the highest specific absorption rates (up to 1000 W/g) in all the applied
fields of 800, 600, and 400 Oe in agar during magnetic hyperthermia
measurements. The general enhancement in the specific absorption rate
post-annealing underscores the importance of the annealing atmosphere in the
enhancement of the magnetic and structural properties of nanostructures.

<h3>Nanomechanically-induced nonequilibrium quantum phase transition to a  self-organized density wave of a Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18015" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18015</a>
<br>
<i>Milan Radonjić, Leon Mixa, Axel Pelster, Michael Thorwart</i>
<p>We report on a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition (NQPT) in a hybrid
quantum many-body system consisting of a vibrational mode of a damped
nanomembrane interacting optomechanically with a cavity, whose output light
couples to two internal states of an ultracold Bose gas held in an external
quasi-one-dimensional box potential. For small effective membrane-atom
couplings, the system is in a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) steady
state, with no membrane displacement. Depending on the transition frequency
between the two internal atomic states, either one or both internal states are
occupied. By increasing the atom-membrane couplings, the system transitions to
a symmetry-broken self-organized BEC phase, which is characterized by a
considerably displaced membrane steady-state and density wave-like BEC
profiles. This NQPT can be both discontinuous and continuous for a certain
interval of transition frequencies, and is purely discontinuous outside of it.

<h3>Light-enhanced nonlinear Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18038" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18038</a>
<br>
<i>Fang Qin, Rui Chen, Ching Hua Lee</i>
<p>It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall
conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be
dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken
inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the
linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in
principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window
close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without
careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we
transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that
enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses.
Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a
topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and
importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable
to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is
even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in
our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively
across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the
controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.

<h3>Reversible, Irreversible and Mixed Regimes for Periodically Driven Disks  in Random Obstacle Arrays</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18042</a>
<br>
<i>D. Minogue, M.R. Eskildsen, C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt</i>
<p>We examine an assembly of repulsive disks interacting with a random obstacle
array under a periodic drive, and find a transition from reversible to
irreversible dynamics as a function of drive amplitude or disk density. At low
densities and drives, the system rapidly forms a reversible state where the
disks return to their exact positions at the end of each cycle. In contrast, at
high amplitudes or high densities, the system enters an irreversible state
where the disks exhibit normal diffusion. Between these two regimes, there can
be a glassy irreversible state where most of the system is reversible, but
localized irreversible regions are present that are prevented from spreading
through the system due to a screening effect from the obstacles. We also find
states that we term combinatorial reversible states in which the disks return
to their original positions after multiple driving cycles. In these states,
individual disks exchange positions but form the same configurations during the
subcycles of the larger reversible cycle.

<h3>Observation of the scaling dimension of fractional quantum Hall anyons</h3>

<i>A. Veillon, C. Piquard, P. Glidic, Y. Sato, A. Aassime, A. Cavanna, Y. Jin, U. Gennser, A. Anthore, F. Pierre</i>
<p>Unconventional quasiparticles emerging in the fractional quantum Hall regime
present the challenge of observing their exotic properties unambiguously.
Although the fractional charge of quasiparticles has been demonstrated since
nearly three decades, the first convincing evidence of their anyonic quantum
statistics has only recently been obtained and, so far, the so-called scaling
dimension that determines the quasiparticles propagation dynamics remains
elusive. In particular, while the non-linearity of the tunneling quasiparticle
current should reveal their scaling dimension, the measurements fail to match
theory, arguably because this observable is not robust to non-universal
complications. Here we achieve an unambiguous measurement of the scaling
dimension from the thermal to shot noise cross-over, and observe a long-awaited
agreement with expectations. Measurements are fitted to the predicted finite
temperature expression involving both the quasiparticles scaling dimension and
their charge, in contrast to previous charge investigations focusing on the
high bias shot noise regime. A systematic analysis, repeated on multiple
constrictions and experimental conditions, consistently matches the theoretical
scaling dimensions for the fractional quasiparticles emerging at filling
factors 1/3, 2/5 and 2/3. This establishes a central property of fractional
quantum Hall anyons, and demonstrates a powerful and complementary window into
exotic quasiparticles.

<h3>Understanding the thickness-dependent dielectric permittivity of thin  films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18061</a>
<br>
<i>Alessio Zaccone</i>
<p>The dielectric properties of thin films are of paramount important in a
variety of technological applications, and of fundamental importance for solid
state research. In spite of this, there is currently no theoretical
understanding of the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the thickness
of thin films. We develop a confinement model within the Lorentz-field
framework for the microscopic Langevin-equation description of dielectric
response in terms of the atomic-scale vibrational modes of the solid. Based on
this, we derive analytical expressions for the dielectric permittivity as a
function of thin film thickness, in excellent agreement with experimental data
of Barium-Strontium-Titanate (BST) thin films of different stoichiometry. The
theory shows that the decrease of dielectric permittivity with decreasing
thickness is directly caused by the restriction in $k$-space of the available
eigenmodes for field-induced alignment of ions and charged groups.

<h3>An Economical and Efficient Helium Recovery System for  Vibration-Sensitive Applications</h3>

<i>Zhiyuan Yin, Liya Bi, Yueqing Shi, Shaowei Li</i>
<p>Here, we report the design of a liquefaction system that is ideal for
recovering the helium (He) vapor from vibration-sensitive cryogenic
instruments. We demonstrate its performance by recycling the boil-off from a
commercial low-temperature scanning probe microscope (SPM). It features a very
high He recovery rate and induces negligible vibration noise to the SPM. Given
its adaptability, affordability, and homemade-friendly nature, we anticipate
our system will impact a broad spectrum of research fields.

<h3>Game susceptibility, Correlation and Payoff capacity as a measure of  Cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of some Social dilemmas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18065" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18065</a>
<br>
<i>Rajdeep Tah, Colin Benjamin</i>
<p>Analytically, finding the origins of cooperative behavior in infinite-player
games is an exciting topic of current interest. Previously, cooperative
behavior has been studied by considering game magnetization and individual
player's average payoff as indicators. This paper shows that game
susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity can aid in understanding
cooperative behavior in social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit. In this
paper, we compare three analytical methods, i.e., Nash equilibrium mapping
(NEM), Darwinian selection (DS), and Aggregate selection (AS), with a
numerical-based method (ABM) via the game susceptibility, correlation, and
payoff capacity as indicators of cooperative behavior. AS and DS fail compared
to NEM and ABM by giving incorrect results for the indicators in question. The
results obtained via NEM and ABM are in good agreement for all three indicators
in question, for both Hawk-Dove and the Public goods games. After comparing the
results obtained for all five indicators, we see that individual players'
average payoff and payoff capacity are the best indicators to study cooperative
behavior among players in the thermodynamic limit. This paper finds that NEM
and ABM, along with the selected indicators, offer valuable insights into
cooperative behavior in infinite-player games, contributing to understanding
social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>Renormalization group flow and fixed-point in tensor network  representations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18068" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18068</a>
<br>
<i>Atsushi Ueda</i>
<p>In this thesis, we present a novel method combining energy-based finite-size
scaling with tensor network renormalization (TNR) to study phase transitions in
lattice models. This approach effectively calculates running coupling constants
and reduces the numerical errors typically associated with TNR, thus requiring
fewer renormalization group (RG) steps and less computational resources. Our
methodology, contrasting with traditional methods, doesn't depend on large
system sizes, making it efficient and robust against simulation scale
challenges.
We also explore the origins of numerical errors in TNR from a
field-theoretical perspective, focusing on how these errors scale with the
approximation parameter $D$. This understanding is crucial for error management
in simulations.
Moreover, we investigate the tensor structure of fixed points in lattice
models, addressing challenges from finite bond dimensions using an analytical
approach involving conformal mappings. We discover that the tensor elements of
fixed-point tensors align with four-point functions of primary operators in
conformal field theory (CFT), demonstrating a significant link between CFT and
lattice models. This finding underscores the universality of non-trivial
infrared physics at the lattice level, bridging theoretical concepts with
practical computations in lattice models, and offering deeper insights into the
universal aspects of critical phenomena.
