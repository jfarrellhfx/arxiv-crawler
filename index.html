<h3>Current-sensitive Hall effect in a chiral-orbital-current state</h3>

Chiral orbital currents (COC) underpin a novel colossal magnetoresistance
(CMR) in ferrimagnetic Mn3Si2Te6 [1]. Here we report the Hall effect in the COC
state which exhibits the following unprecedented features: (1) A sharp,
current-sensitive peak in the magnetic field dependence of the Hall
resistivity; (2) An unusually large Hall angle reaching up to 0.15 (comparable
to the highest values yet reported); and (3) A current-sensitive scaling
relation between the Hall conductivity sigma_xy and the longitudinal
conductivity sigma_xx, namely, sigma_xy ~ sigma_xx^alpha with alpha ranging
between 3 and 5, which is both sensitive to external current and exceptionally
large compared to alpha < 2 typical of most solids. These anomalies point to a
giant, current-sensitive Hall effect that is unique to the COC state. We argue
that a magnetic field induced by the fully developed COC combines with the
applied magnetic field to exert the greatly enhanced transverse force on charge
carriers, which dictates the novel Hall responses. The COC Hall effect is
unique, as it is generated and controlled via the interaction between intrinsic
COC and applied external currents, which leads to novel transport phenomena of
fundamental and technological significance and requires new physics for
explanation.

<h3>Quantized Non-Volatile Nanomagnetic Synapse based Autoencoder for  Efficient Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detection</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06449" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06449</a>
<br>
<i>Muhammad Sabbir Alam, Walid Al Misba, Jayasimha Atulasimha</i>
<br>
<br>
In the autoencoder based anomaly detection paradigm, implementing the
autoencoder in edge devices capable of learning in real-time is exceedingly
challenging due to limited hardware, energy, and computational resources. We
show that these limitations can be addressed by designing an autoencoder with
low-resolution non-volatile memory-based synapses and employing an effective
quantized neural network learning algorithm. We propose a ferromagnetic
racetrack with engineered notches hosting a magnetic domain wall (DW) as the
autoencoder synapses, where limited state (5-state) synaptic weights are
manipulated by spin orbit torque (SOT) current pulses. The performance of
anomaly detection of the proposed autoencoder model is evaluated on the NSL-KDD
dataset. Limited resolution and DW device stochasticity aware training of the
autoencoder is performed, which yields comparable anomaly detection performance
to the autoencoder having floating-point precision weights. While the limited
number of quantized states and the inherent stochastic nature of DW synaptic
weights in nanoscale devices are known to negatively impact the performance,
our hardware-aware training algorithm is shown to leverage these imperfect
device characteristics to generate an improvement in anomaly detection accuracy
(90.98%) compared to accuracy obtained with floating-point trained weights.
Furthermore, our DW-based approach demonstrates a remarkable reduction of at
least three orders of magnitude in weight updates during training compared to
the floating-point approach, implying substantial energy savings for our
method. This work could stimulate the development of extremely energy efficient
non-volatile multi-state synapse-based processors that can perform real-time
training and inference on the edge with unsupervised data.

<h3>Anatomy of the eigenstates distribution: a quest for a genuine  multifractality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06468" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06468</a>
<br>
<i>Anton Kutlin, Ivan M. Khaymovich</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by a series of recent works, an interest in multifractal phases has
risen as they are believed to be present in the Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase
and are of high demand in quantum annealing and machine learning. Inspired by
the success of the RosenzweigPorter (RP) model with Gaussian-distributed
hopping elements, several RP-like ensembles with the fat-tailed distributed
hopping terms have been proposed, with claims that they host the desired
multifractal phase. In the present work, we develop a general (graphical)
approach allowing a self-consistent analytical calculation of fractal
dimensions for a generic RP model and investigate what features of the RP
Hamiltonians can be responsible for the multifractal phase emergence. We
conclude that the only feature contributing to a genuine multifractality is the
on-site energies' distribution, meaning that no random matrix model with a
statistically homogeneous distribution of diagonal disorder and uncorrelated
off-diagonal terms can host a multifractal phase.

<h3>Percolation Transition in a Topological Phase</h3>

Transition out of a topological phase is typically characterized by
discontinuous changes in topological invariants along with bulk gap closings.
However, as a clean system is geometrically punctured, it is natural to ask the
fate of an underlying topological phase. To understand this physics we
introduce and study both short and long-ranged toy models where a one
dimensional topological phase is subjected to bond percolation protocols. We
find that non-trivial boundary phenomena follow competing energy scales even
while global topological response is governed via geometrical properties of the
percolated lattice. Using numerical, analytical and appropriate mean-field
studies we uncover the rich phenomenology and the various cross-over regimes of
these systems. In particular, we discuss emergence of "fractured topological
region" where an overall trivial system contains macroscopic number of
topological clusters. Our study shows the interesting physics that can arise
from an interplay of geometrical disorder within a topological phase.

<h3>Topological Triviality of Flat Hamiltonians</h3>

<br>
Landau levels play a key role in theoretical models of the quantum Hall
effect. Each Landau level is degenerate, flat and topologically non-trivial.
Motivated by Landau levels, we study tight-binding Hamiltonians whose energy
levels are all flat. We demonstrate that in two dimensions, for such
Hamiltonians, the flat bands must be topologically trivial. To that end, we
show that the projector onto each flat band is necessarily strictly local. Our
conclusions do not need the assumption of lattice translational invariance.

<h3>The $q-$state Potts model from the Nonperturbative Renormalization Group</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06489" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06489</a>
<br>
<i>Carlos A. Sánchez-Villalobos, Bertrand Delamotte, Nicolás Wschebor</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the $q$-state Potts model for $q$ and the space dimension $d$
arbitrary real numbers using the Derivative Expansion of the Nonperturbative
Renormalization Group at its leading order, the local potential approximation
(LPA and LPA'). We determine the curve $q_c(d)$ separating the first
($q>q_c(d)$) and second ($q<q_c(d)$) order phase transition regions for
$2.8<d\leq 4$. At small $\epsilon=4-d$ and $\delta=q-2$ the calculation is
performed in a double expansion in these parameters and we find $q_c(d)=2+a
\epsilon^2$ with $a\simeq 0.1$. For finite values of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$,
we obtain this curve by integrating the LPA and LPA' flow equations. We find
that $q_c(d=3)=2.11(7)$ which confirms that the transition is of first order in
$d=3$ for the three-state Potts model.

<h3>$Q$-voter model with independence on signed random graphs: homogeneous  approximations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06510</a>
<br>
<i>Andrzej Krawiecki, Tomasz Gradowski</i>
<br>
<br>
The $q$-voter model with independence is generalized to signed random graphs
and studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations and theoretically using the
mean field approximation and different forms of the pair approximation. In the
signed network with quenched disorder, positive and negative signs associated
randomly with the links correspond to reinforcing and antagonistic
interactions, promoting, respectively, the same or opposite orientations of
two-state spins representing agents' opinions; otherwise, the opinions are
called mismatched. With probability $1-p$, the agents change their opinions if
the opinions of all members of a randomly selected $q$-neighborhood are
mismatched, and with probability $p$, they choose an opinion randomly. The
model on networks with finite mean degree $\langle k \rangle$ and fixed
fraction of the antagonistic interactions $r$ exhibits ferromagnetic transition
with varying the independence parameter $p$, which can be first- or
second-order, depending on $q$ and $r$, and disappears for large $r$. Besides,
numerical evidence is provided for the occurrence of the spin-glass-like
transition for large $r$. The order and critical lines for the ferromagnetic
transition on the $p$ vs. $r$ phase diagram obtained in Monte Carlo simulations
are reproduced qualitatively by the mean field approximation. Within the range
of applicability of the pair approximation, for the model with $\langle k
\rangle$ finite but $\langle k \rangle \gg q$, predictions of the homogeneous
pair approximation concerning the ferromagnetic transition show much better
quantitative agreement with numerical results for small $r$ but fail for larger
$r$. A more advanced signed homogeneous pair approximation is formulated which
distinguishes between classes of active links with a given sign connecting
nodes occupied by agents with mismatched opinions...

<h3>Dominant role of charge ordering on high harmonic generation in  Pr_{0.6}Ca_{0.4}MnO_{3}</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06537" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06537</a>
<br>
<i>A. Nakano, K. Uchida, Y. Tomioka, M. Takaya, Y. Okimoto, K. Tanaka</i>
<br>
<br>
High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a typical high-order nonlinear optical
phenomenon and can be used to probe electronic structures of solids. Here, we
investigate the temperature dependence of HHG from Pr_{0.6}Ca_{0.4}MnO_{3} in
the range of 7 K to 294 K including the charge ordering (CO) transition and
magnetic transition temperatures. The high-harmonic intensity remains almost
constant in the high-temperature charge-disordered phase. However, as the
temperature is lowered, it starts to gradually increase near the CO transition
temperature where an optical gap related to the CO phase appears. The anomalous
gap energy dependence resembles the one recently reported in a Mott insulator.
We attribute the HHG suppression at high temperatures to the destructive
interference among high-harmonic emissions from thermally activated multiple CO
configurations. Our results suggest that HHG is a promising tool for probing
the fluctuation of local order in strongly correlated systems.

<h3>In-plane structure of the electric double layer in the primitive model  using classical density functional theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06542</a>
<br>
<i>Peter Cats, Andreas Härtel</i>
<br>
<br>
The electric double layer (EDL) has a pivotal role in screening charges on
surfaces as in supercapacitor electrodes or colloidal and polymer solutions.
Its structure is determined by correlations between the finite-sized ionic
charge carriers of the underlying electrolyte and, this way, these correlations
affect the properties of the EDL and of applications utilizing EDLs. We study
the structure of EDLs within classical density functional theory (DFT) in order
to uncover whether a structural transition in the first layer of the EDL that
is driven by changes in the surface potential depends on specific particle
interactions or has a general footing. This transition has been found in
full-atom simulations. Thus far, investigating the in-plane structure of the
EDL for the primitive model (PM) using DFT proved a challenge. We show here
that the use of an appropriate functional predicts the in-plane structure of
EDLs in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This
provides the playground to investigate how the structure factor within a layer
parallel to a charged surface changes as function of both the applied surface
potential and its separation from the surface. We discuss pitfalls in properly
defining an in-plane structure factor and fully map out the structure of the
EDL within the PM for a wide range of electrostatic electrode potentials.
However, we do not find any signature of a structural crossover and conclude
that the previously reported effect is not fundamental but rather occurs due to
the specific force field of ions used in the simulations.

<h3>Anharmonic coherent dynamics of the soft phonon mode of a PbTe crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06549" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06549</a>
<br>
<i>A. A. Melnikov, Yu. G. Selivanov, S. V. Chekalin</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the ultrafast optical response of PbTe to an intense
single-cycle terahertz pulse, resonant with the soft transverse optical (TO)
phonon mode of the crystal. We detect multifrequency oscillations of the
reflectance anisotropy, which we associate with nonlinear motion of the TO
phonon oscillator excited directly by the terahertz pulse. Our observation of
monotonically decaying optical anisotropy together with second harmonic
oscillations of the TO mode is an evidence of a transient non-centrosymmetric
state of the crystal lattice that can be accompanied by the ferroelectric
order. We suppose that this state is induced in the PbTe crystal by the intense
terahertz pulse via alignment of the local polar nanodomains. This hypothesis
is partially supported by the observation of coherent phonons near the
satellite phonon mode frequency that are impulsively generated by a femtosecond
laser pulse and are considerably enhanced by a synchronous terahertz pulse.

<h3>Equilibrium with coordinate dependent diffusion: Comparison of different  stochastic processes</h3>

We investigate in this paper two different processes of scaling that map a
multiplicative noise problem to an additive noise form. While by one method of
scaling, at the over-damped limit, we obtain the equilibrium distribution of
the It\^o-process, by the other method we get the distribution of the
H\"anggi-Klimontovich (Isothermal) process. We compare the It\^o-process to the
H\"anggi-Klimontovich (Isothermal) process in the light of these additive noise
counterparts of the multiplicative noise problem to identify the underlying
details of these processes. Where it comes out that the It\^o-process is
consistent with the standard physics of Brownian motion, the
H\"anggi-Klimontovich process, on the other hand, appears inconsistent with the
fluctuation-dissipation relation. Present analysis provides us with insights
related to coordinate-dependent diffusion which could be useful for application
across discipline.

<h3>Uncovering the spin ordering in magic-angle graphene via edge state  equilibration</h3>

<br>
<br>
Determining the symmetry breaking order of correlated quantum phases is
essential for understanding the microscopic interactions in their host systems.
The flat bands in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) provide an
especially rich arena to investigate such interaction-driven ground states, and
while progress has been made in identifying the correlated insulators and their
excitations at commensurate moire filling factors, the spin-valley
polarizations of the topological states that emerge at high magnetic field
remain unknown. Here we introduce a new technique based on twist-decoupled van
der Waals layers that enables measurements of their electronic band structure
and, by studying the backscattering between counter-propagating edge states,
determination of relative spin polarization of the their edge modes. Applying
this method to twist-decoupled MATBG and monolayer graphene, we find that the
broken-symmetry quantum Hall states that extend from the charge neutrality
point in MATBG are spin-unpolarized at even integer filling factors. The
measurements also indicate that the correlated Chern insulator emerging from
half filling of the flat valence band is spin-unpolarized, but suggest that its
conduction band counterpart may be spin-polarized. Our results constrain models
of spin-valley ordering in MATBG and establish a versatile approach to study
the electronic properties of van der Waals systems.

<h3>Flat band localization in twisted bilayer graphene nanoribbons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06596" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06596</a>
<br>
<i>Elias Andrade, Pierre A. Pantaleón, Francisco Guinea, Gerardo G. Naumis</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the electronic structure of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG)
nanoribbons close to the magic angle. We describe a transition from an
incomplete to a complete moir\'e structure. By considering zigzag and armchair
edge terminations, the low-energy bands are strongly modified, and thus, the
edge flat band localization is sensitive to the type of boundary. By means of a
scaled tight-binding model, we calculate the band structure and find that, for
an armchair configuration, an incomplete moir\'e edge suppresses the edge
localization, while for a zigzag configuration, we find a strong interference
of the edge states with the moir\'e bands. In particular, for the armchair
termination, we observe a competition between the ribbon periodicity and the
graphene monolayers, which we describe with a potential well toy model.
Furthermore, for ribbons with widths of multiple moir\'e cells, the flat bands
of the moir\'es in the bulk are unperturbed as we change the borders. These
results are explained in terms of the strong electronic localization, nearly
Gaussian, in the AA stacking regions, as confirmed by an inverse participation
ratio analysis. Our results demonstrate that the electronic structure of TBG
nanoribbons is sensitive to the edge termination, offering an explanation for
recent experimental results.

<h3>Thermal rectification through the topological states of asymmetrical  length armchair graphene nanoribbons heterostructures with vacancies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06623</a>
<br>
<i>David M T Kuo</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical investigation of electron heat current in
asymmetrical length armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) heterostructures with
vacancies, focusing on the topological states (TSs). In particular, we examine
the 9-7-9 AGNR heterostructures where the TSs are well-isolated from the
conduction and valence subbands. This isolation effectively mitigates thermal
noise of subbands arising from temperature fluctuations during charge
transport. Moreover, when the TSs exhibit an orbital off-set, intriguing
electron heat rectification phenomena are observed, primarily attributed to
inter-TS electron Coulomb interactions. To enhance the heat rectification ratio
($\eta_Q$), we manipulate the coupling strengths between the heat sources and
the TSs by introducing asymmetrical lengths in the 9-AGNRs. This approach
offers control over the rectification properties, enabling significant
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce vacancies strategically positioned
between the heat sources and the TSs to suppress phonon heat current. This
arrangement effectively reduces the overall phonon heat current, while leaving
the TSs unaffected. Our findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of
electron heat current in AGNR heterostructures, highlighting the role of
topological states, inter-TS electron Coulomb interactions, and the impact of
structural modifications such as asymmetrical lengths and vacancy positioning.
These results pave the way for the design and optimization of graphene-based
devices with improved thermal management and efficient control of electron heat
transport.

<h3>Hidden non-collinear spin-order induced topological surface states</h3>

<br>
<br>
Rare-earth monopnictides are a family of materials simultaneously displaying
complex magnetism, strong electronic correlation, and topological band
structure. The recently discovered emergent arc-like surface states in these
materials have been attributed to the multi-wave-vector antiferromagnetic
order, yet the direct experimental evidence has been elusive. Here we report
the observation of non-collinear antiferromagnetic order with multiple
modulations using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Moreover, we
discover a hidden spin-rotation transition of single-to-multiple modulations 2
K below the Neel temperature. The hidden transition coincides with the onset of
the surface states splitting observed by our angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy measurements. Single modulation gives rise to a band inversion
with induced topological surface states in a local momentum region while the
full Brillouin zone carries trivial topological indices, and multiple
modulation further splits the surface bands via non-collinear spin tilting, as
revealed by our calculations. The direct evidence of the non-collinear spin
order in NdSb not only clarifies the mechanism of the emergent topological
surface states, but also opens up a new paradigm of control and manipulation of
band topology with magnetism.

<h3>Simultaneous thermoosmotic and thermoelectric responses in nanoconfined  electrolyte solutions: Effects of nanopore structures and membrane properties</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hypothesis: Nanofluidic systems provide an emerging and efficient platform
for thermoelectric conversion and fluid pumping with low-grade heat energy. As
a basis of their performance enhancement, the effects of the structures and
properties of the nanofluidic systems on the thermoelectric response (TER) and
the thermoosmotic response (TOR) are yet to be explored. Methods: The
simultaneous TER and TOR of electrolyte solutions in nanofluidic membrane pores
on which an axial temperature gradient is exerted are investigated numerically
and semi-analytically. A semi-analytical model is developed with the
consideration of finite membrane thermal conductivity and the
reservoir/entrance effect. Findings: The increase in the access resistance due
to the nanopore-reservoir interfaces accounts for the decrease of short circuit
current at the low concentration regime. The decrease in the thermal
conductivity ratio can enhance the TER and TOR. The maximum power density
occurring at the nanopore radius twice the Debye length ranges from several to
dozens of mW K$^{-2}$ m$^{-2}$ and is an order of magnitude higher than typical
thermo-supercapacitors. The surface charge polarity can heavily affect the sign
and magnitude of the short-circuit current, the Seebeck coefficient, and the
open-circuit thermoosmotic coefficient, but has less effect on the
short-circuit thermoosmotic coefficient. Furthermore, the membrane thickness
makes different impacts on TER and TOR for zero and finite membrane thermal
conductivity.

Rare-earth nitrides, such as gadolinium nitride (GdN), have great potential
for spintronic devices due to their unique magnetic and electronic properties.
GdN has a large magnetic moment, low coercitivity and strong spin polarization
suitable for spin transistors, magnetic memories and spin-based quantum
computing devices. Its large spin splitting of the optical bandgap functions as
a spin-filter that offers the means for spin-polarized current injection into
metals, superconductors, topological insulators, 2D layers and other novel
materials. As spintronics devices require thin films, a successful
implementation of GdN demands a detailed investigation of the optical and
magnetic properties in very thin films. With this objective, we investigate the
dependence of the direct and indirect optical bandgaps (Eg) of half-metallic
GdN, using the trilayer structure AlN(10 nm)/GdN(t)/AlN(10 nm) for GdN film
thickness t in the ranging from 6 nm to 350 nm, in both paramagnetic (PM) and
ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our results show a bandgap of 1.6 eV in the PM
state, while in the FM state the bandgap splits for the majority (0.8 eV) and
minority (1.2 eV) spin states. As the GdN film becomes thinner the spin split
magnitude increases by 60%, going from 0.290 eV to 0.460 eV. Our results point
to methods for engineering GdN films for spintronic devices.

Ferroelectricity, a spontaneous and reversible electric polarization, is
found in certain classes of van der Waals (vdW) material heterostructures. The
discovery of ferroelectricity in twisted vdW layers provides new opportunities
to engineer spatially dependent electric and optical properties associated with
the configuration of moir\'e superlattice domains and the network of domain
walls. Here, we employ near-field infrared nano-imaging and nano-photocurrent
measurements to study ferroelectricity in minimally twisted WSe2. The
ferroelectric domains are visualized through the imaging of the plasmonic
response in a graphene monolayer adjacent to the moir\'e WSe2 bilayers.
Specifically, we find that the ferroelectric polarization in moir\'e domains is
imprinted on the plasmonic response of the graphene. Complementary
nano-photocurrent measurements demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties
of graphene are also modulated by the proximal ferroelectric domains. Our
approach represents an alternative strategy for studying moir\'e
ferroelectricity at native length scales and opens promising prospects for
(opto)electronic devices.

We have proposed a method to accelerate the computation of Kubo formula
optimized to vector processors. The key concept is parallel evaluation of
multiple integration points, enabled by batched linear algebra operations.
Through benchmark comparisons between the vector-based NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA
and the scalar-based Xeon machines in node performance, we verified that the
vectorized implementation was speeded up to approximately 2.2 times faster than
the baseline. We have also shown that the performance improvement due to
padding, indicating that avoiding the memory-bank conflict is critically
important in this type of task.

The growth of high-composition GeSn films of the future will likely be guided
via algorithms. In this study we show how a logarithmic-based algorithm can be
used to obtain GeSn compositions up to 16 % on GaAs (001) substrates via
molecular beam epitaxy. Within we demonstrate composition targeting and
logarithmic gradients to achieve pseudomorph GeSn compositions near 11% before
partial relaxation of the structure and a continued gradient to 16 % GeSn.
Using algorithmic-based control and calibration, the ability to consistently
and easily grow GeSn compositions above 20 % will likely become very possible.
In this report, we use X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy to analyze
and demonstrate some of the possible growths that can be produced with the

introduce ParetoCSP, a novel algorithm for CSP, which combines a
multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) with a neural network inter-atomic
potential (IAP) model to find energetically optimal crystal structures given
chemical compositions. We enhance the NSGA-III algorithm by incorporating the
genotypic age as an independent optimization criterion and employ the M3GNet
universal IAP to guide the GA search. Compared to GN-OA, a state-of-the-art
neural potential based CSP algorithm, ParetoCSP demonstrated significantly
better predictive capabilities, outperforming by a factor of $2.562$ across
$55$ diverse benchmark structures, as evaluated by seven performance metrics.
Trajectory analysis of the traversed structures of all algorithms shows that
ParetoCSP generated more valid structures than other algorithms, which helped
guide the GA to search more effectively for the optimal structures

The recent discovery of multiple superconducting phases in CeRh2As2 has
attracted considerable interest. These rich phases are thought to be related to
the locally noncentrosymmetric crystal structure, although the possible role of
a quadrupole density wave preceding the superconductivity remains an open
question. While measurements of physical properties imply that the Ce 4f
electrons could play an essential role, the momentum-resolved electronic
structure remains hitherto unreported, hindering an in-depth understanding of
the underlying physics. Here, we report a high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission study of CeRh2As2. Our results reveal fine splittings of
conduction bands, which are directly related to the locally noncentrosymmetric
structure, as well as a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, implying weak
interlayer hopping and possible nesting instabilities. Our experiments also
uncover the fine structures and pronounced temperature evolution of the Kondo
peak, demonstrating strong Kondo effect facilitated by excited crystal electric
field states. Our results unveil the salient electronic features arising from
the interplay between the crystal structure and strong electron correlation,
providing spectroscopic insight for understanding the heavy fermion physics and
unconventional quadrupole density wave in this enigmatic compound.

Inspired by the problem of biofilm growth, we numerically investigate
clustering in a two-dimensional suspension of active (Janus) particles of
finite size confined in a circular cavity. Their dynamics is regulated by a
non-reciprocal mechanism that causes them to switch from active to passive
above a certain threshold of the perceived near-neighbor density (quorum
sensing).A variety of cluster phases -- glassy, solid (hexatic) and liquid --
is observed depending on the particle dynamics at the boundary, the quorum
sensing range, and the level of noise

We have studied numerically the appearance of multiscaling behavior in the

multifractal distribution of the decay exponents for the spatial correlation
functions at the critical temperature. We have computed the exponents of the

10th power, by studying three different quantities: global susceptibilities,
local susceptibilities and correlation functions. We have found very clear
evidences for multiscaling behavior.

A Weyl node is characterized by its chirality and tilt. We develop a theory
of how $n$th order nonlinear optical conductivity behaves under transformations
of anisotropic tensor and tilt, which clarify how chirality-dependent and
-independent parts of optical conductivity transform under the reversal of tilt
and chirality. Built on this theory, we propose ferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 as a
magnetoelectrically regulated, terahertz optical device, by magnetoelectrically
switching the chirality-dependent and -independent dc photocurrents. These
results are useful for creating nonlinear optical devices based on topological
Weyl semimetals.

We study a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas in a harmonic trapping
potential using finite temperature lattice quantum Monte Carlo methods. We are
able to compute observables in the canonical ensemble via an efficient
projective approach. Results for density profiles, correlations, as well as
energy-related observables are presented for systems with up to 80 particles
and various temperatures. Our simulations reproduce known numerical results and
compare well against available experimental data close to the ground state,
while at higher temperature they are benchmarked against the exact solution of
the two particle system. This provides an indication that a standard lattice
discretization is sufficient to capture the physics of the trapped system. In
the special case of a spin-imbalanced gas, we find no sign problem in the
parameter ranges studied, allowing access without the need of specialized
methods. This includes simulations close to the ground state and at large
population imbalance, where we present results for density correlations,
indicating pairing at finite total momentum.

<h3>Laser-induced heating for the experimental study of critical Casimir  forces with optical trapping</h3>

<br>
Critical Casimir interactions represent a perfect example of bath-induced
forces at mesoscales. These forces may have a relevant role in the living
systems as well as a role in the design of nanomachines fueled by environmental
fluctuations. Since the thermal fluctuations are enhanced in the vicinity of a
demixing point of a second-order phase transition, we can modulate the
magnitude and range of these Casimir-like forces by slight changes in the
temperature. Here, we consider two optical trapped colloidal beads inside a
binary mixture. The Casimir interaction is controlled by warming the mixture by
laser-induced heating, whose local application ensures high reproducibility.
Once this two-particle system is warmed, the critical behavior of different
observables allows the system to become its self-thermometer. We use this
experimental scheme for analyzing the energetics of a critical colloidal system
under a non-equilibrium-driven protocol. We quantify how the injected work can
be dissipated to the environment as heat or stored as free energy. Indeed, our
system allows us to use the fluctuation theorems framework for analyzing the
performance of this critically driven toy model. Our work paves the way for
future experimental studies on the non-equilibrium features of bath-induced
forces and the design of critically driven nanosystems.

The lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\ell}$) is a key materials
property in power electronics, thermal barriers, and thermoelectric devices.
Identifying a wide pool of compounds with low $\kappa_{\ell}$ is particularly
important in the development of materials with high thermoelectric efficiency.
The present study contributed to this with a reliable machine learning (ML)
model based on a training set consisting of 268 cubic compounds. For those,
$\kappa_{\ell}$ was calculated from first principles using the
temperature-dependent effective potential (TDEP) method based on forces and
phonons calculated by density functional theory (DFT). 238 of these were
preselected and used to train an initial ML model employing Gaussian process
regression (GPR). The model was then improved with active learning (AL) by
selecting the 30 compounds with the highest GPR uncertainty as new members of
an expanded training set. This was used to predict $\kappa_{\ell}$ of the 1574
cubic compounds in the \textsc{Materials Project} (MP) database with a
validation R2-score of 0.81 and Spearman correlation of 0.93. Out of these, 27
compounds were predicted to have very low values of $\kappa_{\ell}$ ($\leq 1.3$
at 300~K), which was verified by DFT calculations. Some of these have not
previously been reported in the literature, suggesting further investigations
of their electronic thermoelectric properties.

Hydrogen peroxide plays a key role in many environmental and industrial
chemical processes. We performed classical Molecular Dynamics and Continuous
Fractional Component Monte Carlo simulations to calculate thermodynamic
properties of H2O2 in aqueous solutions. The quality of the available force
fields for H2O2 developed by Orabi & English, and by Cordeiro was
systematically evaluated. To assess which water force field is suitable for
predicting properties of H2O2 in aqueous solutions, four water force fields
were used, namely the TIP3P, TIP4P/2005, TIP5P-E, and a modified TIP3P force
field. While the computed densities of pure H2O2 in the temperature range of
253-353 K using the force field by Orabi & English are in excellent agreement
with experimental results, the densities using the force field by Cordeiro are
underestimated by 3%. The TIP4P/2005 force field in combination with the H2O2
force field developed by Orabi & English can predict the densities of H2O2
aqueous solution for the whole range of H2O2 mole fractions in very good
agreement with experimental results. The TIP4P/2005 force field in combination
with either of the H2O2 force fields can predict the viscosities of H2O2
aqueous solutions for the whole range of H2O2 mole fractions in good agreement
with experimental results. The diffusion coefficients for H2O2 and water
molecules using the TIP4P/2005 force field with either of the H2O2 force fields
are almost constant for the whole range of H2O2 mole fractions. The Cordeiro
force field for H2O2 in combination with either of the water force fields can
predict the Henry coefficients of H2O2 in water in better agreement with
experimental values than the force field by Orabi & English.

<h3>Handwritten Digit Recognition by Spin Waves in a Skyrmion Reservoir</h3>

<br>
<i>Mu-Kun Lee, Masahito Mochizuki</i>
<br>
<br>
By performing numerical simulations for the handwritten digit recognition
task, we demonstrate that a magnetic skyrmion lattice confined in a thin-plate
magnet possesses high capability of reservoir computing. We obtain a high
recognition rate of more than 88%, higher by about 10% than a baseline taken as
the echo state network model. We find that this excellent performance arises
from enhanced nonlinearity in the transformation which maps the input data onto
an information space with higher dimensions, carried by interferences of spin
waves in the skyrmion lattice. Because the skyrmions require only application
of static magnetic field instead of nanofabrication for their creation in
contrast to other spintronics reservoirs, our result consolidates the high
potential of skyrmions for application to reservoir computing devices.

<h3>Phantom chain simulations for the effect of stoichiometry on the  fracture of star-polymer networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06827" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06827</a>
<br>
<i>Yuichi Masubuchi</i>
<br>
<br>
By phantom chain simulations, it has been recently discovered that the
fracture characteristics of star polymer networks with different node
functionality and conversion ratios can be described by the cycle rank of the
networks [Masubuchi et al., Macromolecules, doi: 10.1021/acs.macromol.3c01291].
However, due to the employed simplifications and idealizations of the examined
model networks, the results cannot be cast into realistic systems
straightforwardly. For instance, the equimolar reaction was assumed in a
limited volume for the binary mixture of star prepolymers. For this issue, the
present study investigated the effects of stoichiometry by phantom chain
simulations. Examined polymer networks were created from binary mixtures of
star prepolymers with various mixing ratios by the end-linking reaction via
Brownian dynamics simulations. The networks were stretched with energy
minimization until the break. From the mechanical response, strain and stress
at break and work for fracture were obtained. These fracture characteristics
slightly decrease with increasing the contrast of volume fractions of the
binary prepolymer blends when the node functionality is small and the
conversion ratio is large. For the other cases, the stoichiometry does not
impact the fracture behavior. The number ratio of broken bonds and the cycle
rank exhibit similar stoichiometry dependence. Consequently, stoichiometry of
prepolymer blends does not disturb the previously reported relationships
between the fracture characteristics and the cycle rank.

<h3>Linear Scaling Approach for Optical Excitations Using Maximally  Localized Wannier Functions</h3>

<br>
<i>Konrad Merkel, Frank Ortmann</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical method for calculating optical absorption spectra
based on maximally localized Wannier functions, which is suitable for large
periodic systems. For this purpose, we calculate the exciton Hamiltonian, which
determines the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the macroscopic polarization
function and optical absorption characteristics. The Wannier functions are
specific to each material and provide a minimal and therefore computationally
convenient basis. Furthermore, their strong localization greatly improves the
computational performance in two ways: first, the resulting Hamiltonian becomes
very sparse and, second, the electron-hole interaction terms can be evaluated
efficiently in real space, where large electron-hole distances are handled by a
multipole expansion. For the calculation of optical spectra we employ the
sparse exciton Hamiltonian in a time-domain approach, which scales linearly
with system size. We demonstrate the method for bulk silicon - one of the most
frequently studied benchmark systems - and envision calculating optical
properties of systems with much larger and more complex unit cells, which are
presently computationally prohibitive.

<h3>Magnetic flux trapping in porous superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetization of superconducting samples is influenced by their porosity.
In addition to structural modifications and improved cooling, the presence of
pores also plays a role in trapping magnetic flux. Pores have an impact on the
irreversibility field, the full penetration field, and the remnant
magnetization. Generally, as porosity increases, these parameters tend to
decrease. However, in the case of mesoscopic samples or samples with low
critical current densities, increased porosity can actually enhance the
trapping of magnetic flux.

<h3>Spin-orbital correlations from complex orbital order in MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is a spinel based on magnetic V$^{3+}$ ions which host both
spin ($S=1$) and orbital ($l_{eff}=1$) moments. Owing to the underlying
pyrochlore coordination of the magnetic sites, the spins in MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$
only antiferromagnetically order once the frustrating interactions imposed by
the $Fd\overline{3}m$ lattice are broken through an orbitally-driven structural
distortion at T$_{S}$ $\simeq$ 60 K. Consequently, a N\'eel transition occurs
at T$_{N}$ $\simeq$ 40 K. Low temperature spatial ordering of the electronic
orbitals is fundamental to both the structural and magnetic properties, however
considerable discussion on whether it can be described by complex or real
orbital ordering is ambiguous. We apply neutron spectroscopy to resolve the
nature of the orbital ground state and characterize hysteretic spin-orbital
correlations using x-ray and neutron diffraction. Neutron spectroscopy finds
multiple excitation bands and we parameterize these in terms of a multi-level
(or excitonic) theory based on the orbitally degenerate ground state.
Meaningful for the orbital ground state, we report an "optical-like" mode at
high energies that we attribute to a crystal-field-like excitation from the
spin-orbital $j_{eff}$=2 ground state manifold to an excited $j_{eff}$=1 energy
level. We parameterize the magnetic excitations in terms of a Hamiltonian with
spin-orbit coupling and local crystalline electric field distortions resulting
from deviations from perfect octahedra surrounding the V$^{3+}$ ions. We
suggest that this provides compelling evidence for complex orbital order in
MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. We then apply the consequences of this model to understand
hysteretic effects in the magnetic diffuse scattering where we propose that
MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ displays a high temperature orbital memory of the low
temperature spin order.

Strain engineering provides a powerful means to tune the properties of
two-dimensional materials. Accordingly, numerous studies have investigated the
effect of bi- and uniaxial strain. Yet, the strain fields in many systems such
as nanotubes and nanoscale wrinkles are intrinsically inhomogeneous and the
consequences of this symmetry breaking are much less studied. Understanding how
this affects the electronic properties is crucial especially since wrinkling is
a powerful method to apply strain to two-dimensional materials in a controlled
manner. In this paper, we employ density functional theory to understand the
correlation between the atomic and the electronic structure in nanoscale
wrinkles and nanotubes of the prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide
$\mathrm{WSe}_2$. Our research shows that the symmetry breaking in these
structures leads to strong Rashba-like splitting of the bands at the $\Gamma$
point and they thus may be utilized in future tunable spintronic devices. The
inhomogeneous strain reduces the band gap and leads to a localization of the
band edges in the highest-curvature region, thus funneling excitons there.
Moreover, we show how wrinkles can be modeled as nanotubes with the same
curvature and when this comparison breaks down and further inhomogenities have
to be taken into account.

<br>
<br>
Magneto-spectroscopy methods have been employed to study the zero-wavevector
magnon excitations in MnPSe$_3$. Experiments carried out as a function of
temperature and the applied magnetic field show that two low-energy magnon
branches of MnPSe$_3$ in its antiferromagnetic phase are gapped. The
observation of two low-energy magnon gaps (at 14 and 0.7 cm$^{-1}$) implies
that MnPSe$_3$ is a biaxial antiferromagnet. A relatively strong out-of-plane
anisotropy imposes the spin alignment to be in-plane whereas the spin
directionality within the plane is governed by a factor of 2.5 $\times$
10$^{-3}$ weaker in-plane anisotropy.

<br>
<i>Uyen Tu Lieu, Natsuhiko Yoshinaga</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose reinforcement learning to control the dynamical self-assembly of
the dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) from patchy particles. The patchy particles
have anisotropic interactions with other particles and form DDQC. However,
their structures at steady states are significantly influenced by the kinetic
pathways of their structural formation. We estimate the best policy of
temperature control trained by the Q-learning method and demonstrate that we
can generate DDQC with few defects using the estimated policy. The temperature
schedule obtained by reinforcement learning can reproduce the desired structure
more efficiently than the conventional pre-fixed temperature schedule, such as
annealing. To clarify the success of the learning, we also analyse a simple
model describing the kinetics of structural changes through the motion in a
triple-well potential. We have found that reinforcement learning autonomously
discovers the critical temperature at which structural fluctuations enhance the
chance of forming a globally stable state. The estimated policy guides the
system toward the critical temperature to assist the formation of DDQC.

<br>

The theoretical treatment of mixed-crystals is very demanding. A
straight-forward approach to attack this problem is using a super cell method
(SCM). Another one is the Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA), which is an
undocumented feature of the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). For
comparison we use both methods to calculate the total energy (Etot) and the
density of states (DOS) of bulk GaAsxP1-x. We then apply VCA to compute the
stability of different surfaces using an extended version of the surface
formation energy Omega. Our calculations show, on one hand, a working VCA
implementation with its flaws (overestimation of Etot) and strengths (well
modelling of DOS). On other hand, a further result is that bulk of the slab of
a mixed-crystal has a minor influence on the configuration of the surface.

We study magnetic properties of CrO$_2$ within the density functional theory
plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in the paramagnetic phase.
We consider the 3-orbital (per Cr site) model, containing only $t_{2g}$ states,
the $5$-orbital model, including all $d$-states, as well as the model including
also the oxygen $p$-states. Using the recently proposed approach of calculation
of exchange interactions in paramagnetic phase, we extract exchange interaction
parameters and magnon dispersions for these models. While the magnon dispersion
in the 3-orbital model possesses negative branches in accordance with previous
studies in ferromagnetic phase, this drawback is removed in the $5$-orbital
model. The model containing oxygen states overestimates the exchange
interactions and spin stiffness. Therefore, the $5$-orbital model appears as
most adequate for describing magnetic properties of CrO$_2$, in accordance with
the recent experimental data of fixed valence of chromium in this compound. The
possibility of describing magnetic properties of this material starting from
paramagnetic phase points to the correspondence of magnetic properties in this

Research in the field of Materials Science and Engineering focuses on the
design, synthesis, properties, and performance of materials. An important class
of materials that is widely investigated are crystalline materials, including
metals and semiconductors. Crystalline material typically contains a distinct
type of defect called "dislocation". This defect significantly affects various
material properties, including strength, fracture toughness, and ductility.
Researchers have devoted a significant effort in recent years to understanding
dislocation behavior through experimental characterization techniques and
simulations, e.g., dislocation dynamics simulations. This paper presents how
data from dislocation dynamics simulations can be modeled using semantic web
technologies through annotating data with ontologies. We extend the already
existing Dislocation Ontology by adding missing concepts and aligning it with
two other domain-related ontologies (i.e., the Elementary Multi-perspective
Material Ontology and the Materials Design Ontology) allowing for representing
the dislocation simulation data efficiently. Moreover, we show a real-world use
case by representing the discrete dislocation dynamics data as a knowledge
graph (DisLocKG) that illustrates the relationship between them. We also
developed a SPARQL endpoint that brings extensive flexibility to query
DisLocKG.

<br>
<br>
PrRhC2 belongs to the rare-earth carbides family whose properties are of
special interest among topological semimetals due to the simultaneous breaking
of both inversion and time-reversal symmetry. The concomitant absence of both
symmetries grants the possibility to tune the Weyl nodes chirality and to
enhance topological effects like the chiral anomaly. In this work, we report on
the synthesis and compare the magnetotransport measurements of a poly- and
single crystalline PrRhC2 sample. Using a remarkable and sophisticated
technique, the PrRhC2 single crystal is prepared via focused ion beam cutting
from the polycrystalline material. Our magnetometric and specific heat analyses
reveal a non-collinear antiferromagnetic state below 20K, as well as
short-range magnetic correlations and/or magnetic fluctuations well above the
onset of the magnetic transition. The transport measurements on the PrRhC2
single crystal display an electrical resistivity peak at 3K and an anomalous
Hall effect below 6K indicative of a net magnetization component in the ordered
state. Furthermore, we study the angular variation of magnetoresistivities as a
function of the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the injected
electrical current. We find that both the transverse and the longitudinal
resistivities exhibit fourfold angular dependencies due to higher-order terms
in the resistivity tensor, consistent with the orthorhombic crystal symmetry of
PrRhC2. Our experimental results may be interpreted as features of topological
Weyl semimetallic behavior in the magnetotransport properties.

We replicate a renewal process at random times, which is equivalent to
nesting two renewal processes, or considering a renewal process subject to
stochastic resetting. We investigate the consequences on the statistical
properties of the model of the intricate interplay between the two probability
laws governing the distribution of time intervals between renewals, on the one
hand, and of time intervals between resettings, on the other hand. In
particular, the total number ${\mathcal N}_t$ of renewal events occurring
within a specified observation time exhibits a remarkable range of behaviours,
depending on the exponents characterising the power-law decays of the two
probability distributions. Specifically, ${\mathcal N}_t$ can either grow
linearly in time and have relatively negligible fluctuations, or grow
subextensively over time while continuing to fluctuate. These behaviours
highlight the dominance of the most regular process across all regions of the
phase diagram. In the presence of Poissonian resetting, the statistics of
${\mathcal N}_t$ is described by a unique `dressed' renewal process, which is a
deformation of the renewal process without resetting. We also discuss the
relevance of the present study to first passage under restart and to continuous
time random walks subject to stochastic resetting.

The nonlinear Hall effect has recently attracted significant interest due to
its potentials as a promising spectral tool and device applications. A theory
of the nonlinear Hall effect on a disordered lattice is a crucial step towards
explorations in realistic devices, but has not been addressed. We study the
nonlinear Hall response on a lattice, which allows us to introduce disorder
numerically and reveal a mechanism that was not discovered in the previous
momentum-space theories. In the mechanism, disorder induces an increasing
fluctuation of the nonlinear Hall conductance as the Fermi energy moves from
the band edges to higher energies. This fluctuation is a surprise, because it
is opposite to the disorder-free distribution of the Berry curvature. More
importantly, the fluctuation may explain those unexpected observations in the
recent experiments. We also discover an "Anderson localization" of the
nonlinear Hall effect. This work shows an emergent territory of the nonlinear
Hall effect yet to be explored.

Immersing a mobile impurity into a many-body quantum system represents a
theoretically intriguing and experimentally effective way of probing its
properties. In this work, we use exact diagonalization to compute the polaron
spectral function in various instances of interacting Fermi settings, within
the framework of Fermi-Hubbard models. Inspired by possible realizations in
cold atoms and semiconductor heterostructures, we consider different
configurations for the background Fermi gas, including charge density waves,
multiple Fermi seas and pair superfluids. Our results offer a benchmark for
computations based on mean-field approaches and reveal surprising features of
polaron spectra, inspiring new theoretical investigations.

Amorphous VO$_x$ films without a hysteretic phase transition are stable with
respect to thermal cycling and highly demanded as sensitive elements of the
resistive thermometers and microbolometers. In this paper we present simple and
low-temperature growth of amorphous vanadium oxide films by reactive electron
beam evaporation of vanadium metal in $\sim 10^{-4}$ mBar oxygen atmosphere.
The temperature coefficient of the resistivity (TCR) of the films is weakly
sensitive to substrate material and temperature and could be tuned by oxygen
pressure in the growth chamber up to -2.2\% /K. The resistivity value is stable
for months. It depends on the substrate material and substrate temperature
during the evaporation. Simplicity and controllability of the method should
lead to various laboratory and industrial applications.

A computational search for stable structures among both $\alpha$ and $\beta$
phases of ternary ATB4 borides (A= Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Al, Ga, and Zn, T is 3d or
4d transition elements) has been performed. We found that $\alpha$-ATB4
compounds with A=Mg, Ca, Al, and T=V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Co form a family of
structurally stable or almost stable materials. These systems are metallic in
non-magnetic states and characterized by the formation of the localized
molecular-like state of 3d transition metal atom dimers, which leads to the
appearance of numerous Van Hove singularities (VHS) in the electronic spectrum.
The closeness of these VHS to the Fermi level can be easily tuned by electron
doping. For the atoms in the middle of the 3d row (Cr, Mn, and Fe), these VHS
led to magnetic instabilities and new magnetic ground states with a weakly
metallic or semiconducting nature. The magnetic ground states in these systems
appear as an analog of the spin glass state. Experimental attempts to produce
MgFeB4 and associated challenges are discussed, and promising directions for
further synthetic studies are formulated.

The swift progression of machine learning (ML) have not gone unnoticed in the
realm of statistical mechanics. ML techniques have attracted attention by the
classical density-functional theory (DFT) community, as they enable discovery
of free-energy functionals to determine the equilibrium-density profile of a
many-particle system. Within DFT, the external potential accounts for the
interaction of the many-particle system with an external field, thus, affecting
the density distribution. In this context, we introduce a statistical-learning
framework to infer the external potential exerted on a many-particle system. We
combine a Bayesian inference approach with the classical DFT apparatus to
reconstruct the external potential, yielding a probabilistic description of the
external potential functional form with inherent uncertainty quantification.
Our framework is exemplified with a grand-canonical one-dimensional particle
ensemble with excluded volume interactions in a confined geometry. The required
training dataset is generated using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation where the
external potential is applied to the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting
particle coordinates from the MC simulation are fed into the learning framework
to uncover the external potential. This eventually allows us to compute the
equilibrium density profile of the system by using the tools of DFT. Our
approach benchmarks the inferred density against the exact one calculated
through the DFT formulation with the true external potential. The proposed
Bayesian procedure accurately infers the external potential and the density
profile. We also highlight the external-potential uncertainty quantification
conditioned on the amount of available simulated data. The seemingly simple
case study introduced in this work might serve as a prototype for studying a
wide variety of applications, including adsorption and capillarity.

<h3>Non-collinear magnetism engendered by a hidden another order</h3>

Standard microscopic approach to magnetic orders is based on assuming a
Heisenberg form for inter-atomic exchange interactions. These interactions are
considered as a driving force for the ordering transition with magnetic moments
serving as the primary order parameter. Any higher-rank multipoles appearing
simultaneously with such magnetic order are typically treated as auxiliary
order parameters rather than a principal cause of the transition. In this
study, we show that these traditional assumptions are violated in the case of
PrO$_2$. Evaluating the full set of Pr-Pr superexchange interactions from a
first-principles many-body technique we find that its unusual non-collinear 2k
magnetic structure stems from high-rank multipolar interactions, and that the
corresponding contribution of the Heisenberg interactions is negligible. The
observed magnetic order in PrO$_2$ is thus auxiliary to high-rank "hidden"
multipoles. Within this picture we consistently account for previously
unexplained experimental observations like the magnitude of exchange splitting
and the evolution of magnetic structure in external field. Our findings
challenge the standard paradigm of observable magnetic moments being the
driving force for magnetic transitions.

<h3>Orbital magnetization senses topological phase transition in spin-orbit  coupled $α$-$T_3$ system</h3>

The $\alpha$-$T_3$ system undergoes a topological phase transition(TPT)
between two distinct quantum spin-Hall phases across $\alpha=0.5$ when the
spin-orbit interaction of Kane-Mele type is taken into consideration. As a
hallmark of such a TPT, we find that the Berry curvature and the orbital
magnetic moment change their respective signs across the TPT. The trails of the
TPT found in another physical observable e.g. the orbital magnetization(OM) are
understood in terms of valley and spin physics. The valley-resolved OM(VROM)
and the spin-resolved OM(SROM) exhibit interesting characteristics related to
the valley and the spin Chern number when the chemical potential is tuned in
the forbidden gap(s) of the energy spectrum. In particular, we find that the
slope of the VROM vs the chemical potential in the forbidden gap changes its
sign abruptly across the TPT which is also consistent with the corresponding
change in the valley Chern number. Moreover, the slope of the SROM demonstrates
a sudden jump by one unit of $e/h$, (where $e$ is the electronic charge and $h$
is the Planck's constant), across the TPT which is also in agreement with the
corresponding change in the spin Chern number.

During a band-gap-tuned semimetal-to-semiconductor transition, Coulomb
attraction between electrons and holes can cause spontaneously formed excitons
near the zero-band-gap point, or the Lifshitz transition point. This has become
an important route to realize bulk excitonic insulators -- an insulating ground
state distinct from single-particle band insulators. How this route manifests
from weak to strong coupling is not clear. In this work, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and high-resolution synchrotron x-ray
diffraction (XRD), we investigate the broken symmetry state across the
semimetal-to-semiconductor transition in a leading bulk excitonic insulator
candidate system Ta2Ni(Se,S)5. A broken symmetry phase is found to be
continuously suppressed from the semimetal side to the semiconductor side,
contradicting the anticipated maximal excitonic instability around the Lifshitz
transition. Bolstered by first-principles and model calculations, we find
strong interband electron-phonon coupling to play a crucial role in the
enhanced symmetry breaking on the semimetal side of the phase diagram. Our
results not only provide insight into the longstanding debate of the nature of
intertwined orders in Ta2NiSe5, but also establish a basis for exploring
band-gap-tuned structural and electronic instabilities in strongly coupled
systems.

Far-from-equilibrium phenomena are critical to all natural and engineered
systems, and essential to biological processes responsible for life. For over a
century and a half, since Carnot, Clausius, Maxwell, Boltzmann, and Gibbs,
among many others, laid the foundation for our understanding of equilibrium
processes, scientists and engineers have dreamed of an analogous treatment of
non-equilibrium systems. But despite tremendous efforts, a universal theory of
non-equilibrium behavior akin to equilibrium statistical mechanics and
thermodynamics has evaded description. Several methodologies have proved their
ability to accurately describe complex non-equilibrium systems at the
macroscopic scale, but their accuracy and predictive capacity is predicated on
either phenomenological kinetic equations fit to microscopic data, or on
running concurrent simulations at the particle level. Instead, we provide a
framework for deriving stand-alone macroscopic thermodynamics models directly
from microscopic physics without fitting in overdamped Langevin systems. The
only necessary ingredient is a functional form for a parameterized, approximate
density of states, in analogy to the assumption of a uniform density of states
in the equilibrium microcanonical ensemble. We highlight this framework's
effectiveness by deriving analytical approximations for evolving mechanical and
thermodynamic quantities in a model of coiled-coil proteins and double stranded
DNA, thus producing, to the authors' knowledge, the first derivation of the
governing equations for a phase propagating system under general loading
conditions without appeal to phenomenology. The generality of our treatment
allows for application to any system described by Langevin dynamics with
arbitrary interaction energies and external driving, including colloidal
macromolecules, hydrogels, and biopolymers.

The statistical properties of level spacings provide valuable insights into
the dynamical properties of a many-body quantum systems. We investigate the
level statistics of the Fermi-Hubbard model with dimerized hopping amplitude
and find that after taking into account translation, reflection, spin and
{\eta} pairing symmetries to isolate irreducible blocks of the Hamiltonian, the
level spacings in the limit of large system sizes follow the distribution
expected for hermitian random matrices from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble.
We show this by analyzing the distribution of the ratios of consecutive level
spacings in this system, its cumulative distribution and quantify the
deviations of the distributions using their mean, standard deviation and
skewness.

Metastable states with surprising properties abound in Hilbert space. We
study unfrustrated isotropic spin-\half Heisenberg models in honeycomb lattice
and find emergence of \textit{metastable Kitaev spin liquids having a 2-spin
nematic long range order}, via spontaneous symmetry breaking. Decomposition of
isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian $H^H$ into an exact sum of 3 noncommuting
(permuted) Kitaev Hamiltonians, $H^H$ = $H^{K}_{\rm xyz}+H^{K}_{\rm
yzx}+H^{K}_{\rm zxy},$ helps us build a degenerate \textit{manifold of flux
free metastable Kitaev spin liquid vacua} and vector Fermionic (Goldstone like)
collective modes. We introduce a method, \textit{symmetric decomposition of
Hamiltonians}, which might help craft \textit{designer metalstable phases}. It
is likely that small Kitaev interactions present in Jackeli-Khaliullin-Kitaev
materials, with dominant Heisenberg couplings, bring in metastable Kitaev spin
liquid features in real experiments. Present work opens possibilities of
performing quantum computation and other tasks, using exotic quasiparticles and
exotic metastable states, present in nonexotic real systems.
