This paper presents the calculation results of electron-phonon interactions
within the LuH$_2$, LuH$_3$, and LuN systems under 0 GPa and 10 GPa via density
functional theory at the GGA-PBE level. The purpose of this work is to provide
useful data that may be of the interests of the superconducting community as it
was reported that the Lu-H-N compound is likely to be a room-temperature
superconductor under 1 GPa [Nature, 615, 244 (2023)].

<h3>Active topological defect absorption by a curvature singularity</h3>

Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we present a general description of
topological defects dynamics in $p$-atic materials on curved surfaces, and
simplify it in the case of active nematics. We find that activity induces a
geometric contribution to the motility of the $+1/2$ defect. Moreover, in the
case of a cone, the simplest example of a geometry with curvature singularity,
we find that the motility depends on the deficit angle of the cone and changes
sign when the deficit angle is bigger than $\pi$, leading to the change in
active behavior from contractile (extensile) to extensile (contractile)
behavior. Using our analytical framework, we then identify for positively
charged defects the basin of attraction to the cone apex and present
closed-form predictions for defect trajectories near the apex. The analytical
results are quantitatively corroborated against full numerical simulations.
Provided the capture radius is small compared to the cone size, the agreement
is excellent.

<h3>Non-Abelian holonomy of Majorana zero modes coupled to a chaotic quantum  dot</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06754</a>

<br>
<br>
If a quantum dot is coupled to a topological superconductor via tunneling
contacts, each contact hosts a Majorana zero mode in the limit of zero
transmission. Close to a resonance and at a finite contact transparency, the
resonant level in the quantum dot couples the Majorana modes, but a ground
state degeneracy per fermion parity subspace remains if the number of Majorana
modes coupled to the dot is five or larger. Upon varying shape-defining gate
voltages while remaining close to resonance, a nontrivial evolution within the
degenerate ground-state manifold can be achieved. We characterize the
corresponding non-Abelian holonomy for a quantum dot with chaotic classical
dynamics using random matrix theory and discuss measurable signatures of the
non-Abelian time-evolution.

<h3>Combining Electron-Phonon and Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Calculations  of Correlated Materials: Transport in the Correlated Metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>

Electron-electron ($e$-$e$) and electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions are
challenging to describe in correlated materials, where their joint effects
govern unconventional transport, phase transitions, and superconductivity. Here
we combine first-principles $e$-ph calculations with dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT) as a step toward a unified description of $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph
interactions in correlated materials. We compute the $e$-ph self-energy using
the DMFT electron Green's function, and combine it with the $e$-$e$ self-energy
from DMFT to obtain a Green's function including both interactions. This
approach captures the renormalization of quasiparticle dispersion and spectral
weight on equal footing. Using our method, we study the $e$-ph and $e$-$e$
contributions to the resistivity and spectral functions in the correlated metal
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. In this material, our results show that $e$-$e$ interactions
dominate transport and spectral broadening in the temperature range we study
(50$-$310 K), while $e$-ph interactions are relatively weak and account for
only $\sim$10% of the experimental resistivity. We also compute effective
scattering rates, and find that the $e$-$e$ interactions result in scattering
several times greater than the Planckian value $k_BT$, whereas $e$-ph
interactions are associated with scattering rates lower than $k_BT$. Our work
demonstrates a first-principles approach to combine electron dynamical
correlations from DMFT with $e$-ph interactions in a consistent way, advancing
quantitative studies of correlated materials.

<h3>Confined ionic liquids films under shear: The importance of the chemical  nature of the solid surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06774</a>
<br>
<i>Kalil Bernardino, Mauro C. C. Ribeiro</i>
<br>
<br>
Ionic liquids have generated interest in applications as lubricants and as
additives to conventional lubricants due to their unique physical properties.
In these applications, the liquid thin film can be subjected simultaneously to
extremely high shear and loads in addition to nanoconfinement effects. Here, we
use molecular dynamics simulations with a coarse grained model to study a
nanometric film of an ionic liquid confined between two planar solid surfaces
both at equilibrium and at several shear rates. The strength of the interaction
between the solid surface and the ions was changed by simulating three
different surfaces with enhanced interactions with different ions. The increase
of the interaction with either the cation or the anion leads to the formation
of a solid-like layer that moves alongside the substrates, but this layer can
exhibit different structures and stability. An increase in interaction with the
high symmetry anion produces a more regular structure that is more resistant to
the effects of shear and viscous heating. Two definitions were proposed and
used for the calculation of the viscosity: a local definition based on
microscopic characteristics of the liquid and an engineering definition based
on the forces measured at the solid surfaces, with the former displaying a
correlation with the layered structure induced by the surfaces. Because of the
shear thinning behavior of the ionic liquids as well as the temperature rise
brought on by viscous heating, both the engineering and the local viscosities
decrease as the shear rate increases.

<h3>Predicting the Fracture Propensity of Amorphous Silica Using Molecular  Dynamics Simulations and Machine Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06800</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Amorphous silica ($a-SiO_2$) is a widely used inorganic material.
Interestingly, the relationship between the local atomic structures of
$a-SiO_2$ and their effects on ductility and fracture is seldom explored. Here,
we combine large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning
methods to examine the molecular deformations and fracture mechanisms of
$a-SiO_2$. By quenching at high pressures, we demonstrate that densifying
$a-SiO_2$ increases the ductility and toughness. Through theoretical analysis
and simulation results, we find that changes in local bonding topologies
greatly facilitate energy dissipation during plastic deformation, particularly
if the coordination numbers decrease. The appearance of fracture can then be
accurately located based on the spatial distribution of the atoms. We further
observe that the static unstrained structure encodes the propensity for local
atomic coordination to change during applied strain, hence a distinct
connection can be made between the initial atomic configurations before loading
and the final far-from-equilibrium atomic configurations upon fracture. These
results are essential for understanding how atomic arrangements strongly
influence the mechanical properties and structural features in amorphous solids
and will be useful in atomistic design of functional materials.

<h3>Intrinsic thermal conductivity of ZrC from low to ultra-high  temperatures: A critical revisit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06805" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06805</a>
<br>
<i>Janak Tiwari, Tianli Feng</i>
<br>
<br>
Current phonon transport theory based on ground-state calculations has been
successful in predicting thermal conductivity at room and medium temperatures
but may misrepresent behavior at high temperatures. In this work, we predict
the thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of ZrC including electronic and phonon
contributions from 300 K to 3500 K, by including high-order phonon scattering,
lattice expansion, temperature-dependent (TD) harmonic and anharmonic force
constants, and inter-band phonon conduction by using first principles. For the
phonon transport, we find that four-phonon scattering significantly reduces the
phonon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$), e.g., by $\sim$60% and $\sim$75%
at 2500 K and 3500 K, respectively. After including four-phonon scattering and
all other factors, $\kappa_{ph}$ shows a $\sim$T$^{-1.5}$ rather than
$\sim$T$^{-1}$ dependence. The contribution from inter-band (Wigner) phonon
conduction is small, even at ultra-high temperatures. The temperature
dependence of anharmonic force constants decreases the phonon scattering
cross-section at elevated temperatures and increases the $\kappa_{ph}$
significantly (by 52% at 3500 K). For the electronic thermal transport, we find
that it is sensitive to and can be changed by 20% by the TD lattice constants.
The Lorenz number varies from 1.6 to 3.3$\times$10$^{-8}$
W$\cdot\Omega\cdot$K$^{-2}$ at different temperatures. The theoretical
prediction in the literature overpredicts $\kappa_{ph}$ (e.g., $\sim$28%) and
underpredicts the $\kappa_{el}$ (e.g., $\sim$38%), resulting in an overall
underprediction of $\kappa$ ($\sim$26% at 1500 K). The impacts of grain size
and defects are found strong, and no reported experimental data has reached the
intrinsic theoretical thermal conductivity of ZrC yet.

<h3>Graph-informed simulation-based inference for models of active matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06806" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06806</a>

Many collective systems exist in nature far from equilibrium, ranging from
cellular sheets up to flocks of birds. These systems reflect a form of active
matter, whereby individual material components have internal energy. Under
specific parameter regimes, these active systems undergo phase transitions
whereby small fluctuations of single components can lead to global changes to
the rheology of the system. Simulations and methods from statistical physics
are typically used to understand and predict these phase transitions for
real-world observations. In this work, we demonstrate that simulation-based
inference can be used to robustly infer active matter parameters from system
observations. Moreover, we demonstrate that a small number (from one to three)
snapshots of the system can be used for parameter inference and that this
graph-informed approach outperforms typical metrics such as the average
velocity or mean square displacement of the system. Our work highlights that
high-level system information is contained within the relational structure of a
collective system and that this can be exploited to better couple models to
data.

<h3>Geometric approach to nonequilibrium hasty shortcuts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06822" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06822</a>
<br>
<i>Supraja S. Chittari, Zhiyue Lu</i>
<br>
<br>
Thermodynamic systems can exhibit monotonic or non-monotonic responses to
external control. The latter can result in counter-intuitive effects such as
the Mpemba effect -- hot water freezes faster than cold water. The existence of
non-monotonic responses opens the possibility of designing non-equilibrium
shortcuts to drive a system from an initial steady state to a desired final
steady state. We explore the existence of hasty shortcuts in general
thermodynamic systems that can be described by master equations parameterized
by an externally controlled parameter. Here ``hasty shortcuts'' refer to time
protocols of external control that steer a system from its initial state to a
desired state, involving only fast dynamics without requiring any slow
relaxations. By time-scale separation and eigenmode decomposition of the
dynamics's generator, we provide a geometric representation of such shortcuts
in the space of probability distributions (probability simplex). Using the
geometric approach, we identify the necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of non-equilibrium hasty shortcuts. Further, we propose that the
eigenvalue crossing of the generator could constitute the necessary geometric
properties that allow for hasty shortcuts in plain systems with relatively
simple responses to external stimuli. Finally, we validate our theory by
applying it to the self-assembly of an octahedral model inspired by viral
capsid assembly processes.

<h3>Understanding the phase behavior of a proto-biomembrane</h3>

<br>

The rich thermotropic behavior of lipid bilayers is addressed using
phenomenological theory informed by many experiments. The most recent
experiment not yet addressed by theory has shown that the tilt modulus in DMPC
lipid bilayers decreases dramatically as the temperature is lowered toward the
main transition temperature TM . It is shown that this behavior can be
understood by introducing a simple free energy functional for tilt that couples
to the area per molecule. This is combined with a chain melting free energy
functional in which the area is the primary order parameter that is the driver
of the main transition. Satisfactory agreement with experiment is achieved with
values of the model parameters determined by experiments, but the transition is
directly into the gel phase. The theory is then extended to include the
enigmatic ripple phase by making contact with the most recent experimentally
determined ripple structure.

Quantum dots can be formed in simple GaN/AlGaN field-effect-transistors
(FETs) by disordered potential induced by impurities and defects. Here, we
investigate the channel length dependence of the formation of quantum dots. We
observe decrease of the number of formed quantum dots with decrease of the FET
channel length. A few quantum dots are formed in the case with the gate length
of 0.05~$\mu $m and we evaluate the dot parameters and the disordered
potential. We also investigate the effects of a thermal cycle and illumination
of light, and reveal the change of the disordered potential.

<h3>Mapping of H√ºckel Zigzag Carbon Nanotubes onto independent Polyene  chains: application to periodic Nanotubes</h3>

The electric polarizability and the spread of the total position tensors are
used to characterize the metallic vs insulator nature of large (finite)
systems. Finite clusters are usually treated within the open boundary condition
formalism. This introduces border effects, which prevents a fast convergence to
the thermodynamic limit and which can be eliminated within the formalism of
periodic boundary conditions. Recently, we have introduced an original approach
to periodic boundary conditions, named Clifford Boundary Conditions. It
considers a finite fragment extracted from a periodic system and the
modification of its topology into that of a Clifford Torus. The quantity
representing the position is modified in order to fulfill the system
periodicity. In this work, we apply the formalism of Clifford Boundary
Conditions to the case of Carbon Nanotubes, whose treatment results to be
particularly simple for the Zigzag geometry. Indeed, we demonstrate that at the
H\"uckel level these nanotubes, either finite or periodic, are formally
equivalent to a collection of {\em non-interacting dimerized linear chains},
thus simplifying their treatment. This equivalence is used to describe some
nanotube properties as the sum of the contributions of the independent chains
and to identify the origin of peculiar behaviors (such as the conductivity).
Indeed, if the number of hexagons along the circumference is a multiple of
three a metallic behavior is found, namely a divergence of both the (per
electron) polarizability and total position spread of at least one linear
chain. These results are in agreement with those in the literature from
Tight-Binding calculations.

<h3>Energy landscape in NiCoCr-based middle-entropy alloys</h3>

NiCoCr middle-entropy alloy is known for its exceptional strength at both low
and elevated operating temperatures. Mechanical properties of NiCoCr-based
alloys are affected by certain features of the energy landscape, such as the
energy difference between the hcp and fcc phases (which is known to correlate
with the stacking fault energy in the fcc phase) and curvature of the energy
surface. We compute formation energies in the Ni-Co-Cr ternary and related
quaternary systems and investigate dependences of the relative energies on
composition. Such computed composition-structure-property relations can be
useful for tuning composition and designing next-generation alloys with
improved strength.

<h3>On the corner states of two-dimensional second-order topological  insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06854" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06854</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph Poata, Fabio Taddei, Michele Governale</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional second-order topological insulators are characterized by the
presence of topologically protected zero-energy bound states localized at the
corners of a flake. In this paper we theoretically study the occurrence and
features of such corner states inside flakes in the shape of a convex polygon.
We consider two different models, the first obeying inversion symmetry and the
other obeying a combined $\pi/4$ rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry
($\hat{C}_4^z\hat{T}$). By Using an analytical effective model of an edge
corresponding to a massive Dirac fermion, we determine the presence of a corner
state between two given edges by studying the sign of their induced masses and
derive general rules for flakes in the shape of a convex polygon. In
particular, we find that the number of corner states in a flake is always two
in the first model, while in the second model there are either 0, 2 or 4. To
corroborate our findings, we focus on flakes of specific shapes (a triangle and
a square) and use a numerical finite-difference approach to determine the
features of the corner states in terms of their probability density. In the
case of a triangular flake, we can change the position of corner states by
rotating the flake in the first model, while in the second model we can also
change their number. Remarkably, when the induced mass of an edge is zero the
corresponding corner state becomes delocalized along the edge. In the case of a
square flake and the model with $\hat{C}_4^z\hat{T}$ symmetry, there is an
orientation of the flake with respect to the crystal axes, for which the corner
states extend along the whole perimeter of the square.

<h3>Energy-composition relations in $Ni_3(Al_{1-x}X_x)$ phases, relevant to  precipitation in nickel superalloys</h3>

Composition-structure-property dependencies provide useful insights for
guided alloy design. Here we use density functional theory combined with the
multiple scattering theory to compute dependencies of the structural energies
and volumes (per atom) versus composition for ternary $Ni_3(Al_{1-x}X_x)$
alloys with X=(Ti, Zr, Hf; V, Nb, Ta; Cr, Mo, W) in $L1_2$, $D0_{24}$, and
$D0_{19}$ phases with a homogeneous chemical disorder on the $(Al_{1-x}X_x)$
sublattice. Our results provide a better understanding of the physics in
Ni$_3$Al-based precipitates and facilitate design of next-generation nickel
superalloys with precipitation strengthening.

<h3>Structural transition induced by a local conformational change in  biomolecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06884</a>

<i>Fumio Hirata</i>
<br>
<br>
Structural transition induced by a local conformational change in
biomolecules is formulated based on the generalized Langevin theory for the
structural fluctuation of a molecule in solution, and the linear response
theory, derived by Kim and Hirata in 2012. A chemical/mechanical change
introduced at a moiety of biomolecules, such as an amino-acid substitution or a
structural change of a chromophore by the photo-excitation, is considered as a
perturbation, and the rest of the protein as the reference system.
The equation derived for the structural change induced by a
mechanical/chemical perturbation reads,
, where subscripts and label atoms in the biomolecule as a reference system,
is the change in the interaction energy between the moiety and the reference
protein, due to the mechanical/chemical perturbation, and is the
variance-covariance matrix of the reference system.
The physical meaning of the equation is transparent: the force exerted by
atoms in the moiety induces the displacement in atom of protein, which
propagates through the variance covariance matrix to cause a global
conformational change in the molecule, .
Few examples of possible application of the theory, including those in
industry, are suggested.

<h3>Impact of 700keV Ni++ ion irradiation on structural and optical  properties of GaN</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06891" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06891</a>
<br>
<i>Aqeel Ahmed, Zaheer Ahmad</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we present the effects of high-energy Ni++ ion irradiation on
the structural and optical properties of GaN films. Three different irradiation
doses of 1013, 1014, and 1015 ions/cm2 were used while keeping the ion energy
at 700keV. The irradiation induced structural and optical changes in GaN films
were measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The XRD
measurements on irradiated films discovered several extra peaks in the XRD
spectrum compared with the as-grown GaN film indicating the formation of new
phases or defects in the GaN film due to the ion irradiation. The intensity of
these extra peaks increases with increasing ion dose, suggesting that the
density of defects in the GaN film also increases with increasing ion dosage.
The UV-Vis measurements revealed a decrease in the bandgap of the irradiated
GaN films from 3.40 eV for the pristine GaN film to 3.26 eV for the film
irradiated with highest dose of 1015 ions/cm2. The decrease in bandgap can be
attributed to the creation of defects and/or the formation of new phases in the
GaN film due to the ion irradiation.

<h3>Anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect: the topological inequivalence of  skin modes versus point gap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06926" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06926</a>

<br>
<br>
Non-Hermitian skin effect, the localization of an extensive number of
eigenstates at the ends of the system, has greatly expanded the frontier of
physical laws. It has long been believed that the present of skin modes is
equivalent to the topologically nontrivial point gap of complex eigenvalues
under periodic boundary conditions, and vice versa. However, we find that this
concomitance can be broken, i.e., the skin modes can be present or absent
whereas the point gap is topologically trivial or nontrivial, respectively,
named anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect. This anomalous phenomenon arises
when the unidirectional hopping amplitudes leading to the decoupling-like
behaviors among subsystems are emergence. The emergence of the anomalous
non-Hermitian skin effect is accompanied by the mutations of the open boundary
energy spectrum, whose structure exhibits the multifold exceptional point and
can not be recovered by continuum bands. Moreover, an experimental setup using
circuits is proposed to simulate this novel quantum effect. Our results reveal
the topologically inequivalent between skin modes and point gap. This new
effect not only can give a deeper understanding of non-Bloch theory and the
critical phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, but may also inspire new
applications such as in the sensors field.

Bilayer (BL) molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is one of the most important
electronic structures not only in valleytronics but also in realizing
twistronic systems on the basis of the topological mosaics in Moir\'e
superlattices. In this work, BL MoS$_2$ on sapphire substrate with
2$H$-stacking structure is fabricated. We apply the terahertz (THz) time-domain
spectroscopy (TDS) for examining the basic optoelectronic properties of this
kind of BL MoS$_2$. The optical conductivity of BL MoS$_2$ is obtained in
temperature regime from 80 to 280 K. Through fitting the experimental data with
the theoretical formula, the key sample parameters of BL MoS$_2$ can be
determined, such as the electron density, the electronic relaxation time and
the electronic localization factor. The temperature dependence of these
parameters is examined and analyzed. We find that, similar to monolayer (ML)
MoS$_2$, BL MoS$_2$ with 2$H$-stacking can respond strongly to THz radiation
field and show semiconductor-like optoelectronic features. The theoretical
calculations using density functional theory (DFT) can help us to further
understand why the THz optoelectronic properties of BL MoS$_2$ differ from
those observed for ML MoS$_2$. The results obtained from this study indicate
that the THz TDS can be applied suitably to study the optoelectronic properties
of BL MoS$_2$ based twistronic systems for novel applications as optical and
optoelectronic materials and devices.

<h3>Spiking at the edge</h3>

Excitable media, ranging from bioelectric tissues and chemical oscillators to
forest fires and competing populations, are nonlinear, spatially extended
systems capable of spiking. Most investigations of excitable media consider
situations where the amplifying and suppressing forces necessary for spiking
coexist at every point in space. In this case, spiking requires a fine-tuned
ratio between local amplification and suppression strengths. But, in Nature and
engineered systems, these forces can be segregated in space, forming structures
like interfaces and boundaries. Here, we show how boundaries can generate and
protect spiking if the reacting components can spread out: even arbitrarily
weak diffusion can cause spiking at the edge between two non-excitable media.
This edge spiking is a robust phenomenon that can occur even if the ratio
between amplification and suppression does not allow spiking when the two sides
are homogeneously mixed. We analytically derive a spiking phase diagram that
depends on two parameters: (i) the ratio between the system size and the
characteristic diffusive length-scale, and (ii) the ratio between the
amplification and suppression strengths. Our analysis explains recent
experimental observations of action potentials at the interface between two
non-excitable bioelectric tissues. Beyond electrophysiology, we highlight how
edge spiking emerges in predator-prey dynamics and in oscillating chemical
reactions. Our findings provide a theoretical blueprint for a class of
interfacial excitations in reaction-diffusion systems, with potential
implications for spatially controlled chemical reactions, nonlinear waveguides
and neuromorphic computation, as well as spiking instabilities, such as cardiac
arrhythmias, that naturally occur in heterogeneous biological media.

<br>
<br>
We study the complex ferroelastic/ferroelectric domain structure in the
prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO3 epitaxially strained on (110)o-oriented
DyScO3 substrates, using a combination of atomic force microscopy, laboratory
and synchrotron x-ray diffraction and high resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy. We observe that the anisotropic strain imposed by the
orthorhombic substrate creates a large asymmetry in the domain configuration,
with domain walls macroscopically aligned along one of the two in-plane
directions. We show that the periodicity as a function of film thickness
deviates from the Kittel law. As the ferroelectric film thickness increases, we
find that the domain configuration evolves from flux-closure to a/c-phase, with
a larger scale arrangement of domains into superdomains.

Double perovskites R2NiMnO6 (R= Rare earth element) (RNMO) are a significant
class of materials owing to their Multifunctional properties with structural
modifications. In particular, multifunctional double perovskite oxides
La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) which possess both electric and magnetic orderings, chemical
flexibility, versatility, and indispensable properties like high ferromagnetic
curie temperature, high absorption rates, dielectrics, etc. have drawn a lot of
attention due their rich physics and diverse applications in various
technology. This justifies the intense research in this class of materials, and
the keen interest they are subject to both the fundamental and practical side.
In view of the demands of this material in lead-free perovskite solar cells,
photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes, clean hydrogen production, electric
tuneable devices, Fuel cells, gas sensing, and Biomedical applications, there
is a need for an overview of all the literature so far, the ongoing research
and the future prospective. This review summarised all the Physical and
Structural Properties of LNMO such as electric, magnetic, catalytic, and
dielectric properties with their underlying mechanisms. This review article
provides insight into the scope of studies in LNMO material for exploring
unexposed properties in new material research and to identify areas of future
investigation of the materials in the double perovskite family.

Group-IV monochalcogenides have recently shown great potential for their
thermoelectric, ferroelectric, and other intriguing properties. The electrical
properties of group-IV monochalcogenides exhibit a strong dependence on the
chalcogen type. For example, GeTe exhibits high doping concentration, whereas
S/Se-based chalcogenides are semiconductors with sizable bandgaps. Here, we
investigate the electrical and thermoelectric properties of gamma-GeSe, a
recently identified polymorph of GeSe. gamma-GeSe exhibits high electrical
conductivity (~106 S/m) and a relatively low Seebeck coefficient (9.4 uV/K at
room temperature) owing to its high p-doping level (5x1021 cm-3), which is in
stark contrast to other known GeSe polymorphs. Elemental analysis and
first-principles calculations confirm that the abundant formation of Ge
vacancies leads to the high p-doping concentration. The magnetoresistance
measurements also reveal weak-antilocalization because of spin-orbit coupling
in the crystal. Our results demonstrate that gamma-GeSe is a unique polymorph
in which the modified local bonding configuration leads to substantially
different physical properties.

<h3>Bulk-edge correspondence of Stiefel-Whitney and Euler insulators through  the entanglement spectrum and cutting procedure</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a novel type of bulk-edge correspondence for two-dimensional
Stiefel-Whitney insulators and Euler insulators, which are topological
insulators protected by the $PT$ symmetry. We find that, although the energy
spectrum under the open boundary condition is generally gapped, the
entanglement spectrum is gapless when the Stiefel-Whitney or Euler class is
nonzero. The robustness of the gapless spectrum for Stiefel-Whitney insulator
can be understood through an emergent anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry. For
the Euler insulators, we propose a conjecture, which is supported by our
numerical calculation, that the Euler class is equal to the number of crossing
in the entanglement spectrum, taking into account the degree of the crossings.
We also discuss that these crossings of the entanglement spectrum are related
to the gap closing points in the cutting procedure, which is the energy
spectrum as the magnitude of the boundary hopping is varied.

<h3>Tuning the lattice thermal conductivity in van-der-Waals structures  through rotational (dis)ordering</h3>

<br>
<br>
It has recently been demonstrated that MoS2 with irregular interlayer
rotations can achieve an extreme anisotropy in the lattice thermal conductivity
(LTC), which is for example of interest for applications in waste heat
management in integrated circuits. Here, we show by atomic scale simulations
based on machine-learned potentials that this principle extends to other
two-dimensional materials including C and BN. In all three materials
introducing rotational disorder drives the through-plane LTC to the glass
limit, while the in-plane LTC remains almost unchanged compared to the ideal
bulk materials. We demonstrate that the ultralow through-plane LTC is connected
to the collapse of their transverse acoustic modes in the through-plane
direction. Furthermore, we find that the twist angle in periodic moir\'e
structures representing rotational order provides an efficient means for tuning
the through-plane LTC that operates for all chemistries considered here. The
minimal through-plane LTC is obtained for angles between 1 and 4 degree
depending on the material, with the biggest effect in MoS2. The angular
dependence is correlated with the degree of stacking disorder in the materials,
which in turn is connected to the slip surface. This provides a simple
descriptor for predicting the optimal conditions at which the LTC is expected
to become minimal.

Kinetic inductances of superconducting nanostrips with a meander pattern are
theoretically investigated based on the London model, and effect of the current
crowding at the turns of the nanostrips is considered. The complex current
approach is developed for analytical investigation of the kinetic inductance of
nanostrips with turns for thin $d<\lambda$ and narrow $w\ll \lambda^2/d$
superconducting strips, where $d$ is the strip thickness, $w$ is the strip
width, and $\lambda$ is the London penetration depth. We show that the current
distribution in superconducting nanostrips of $wd\ll\lambda^2$ is identical to
that in normal conducting nanostrips of $wd\ll\delta^2/2$, where $\delta$ is
the skin depth, and the dependence of the kinetic inductance on the nanostrip
geometry is identical to that of the normal resistance. Effects of the edge
defects of superconducting strips upon the kinetic inductance are also
considered.

<br>
<br>
Nonsymmorphic crystals can host characteristic double surface Dirac cones
with fourfold degeneracy on the Dirac points, called wallpaper fermion,
protected by wallpaper group symmetry. We clarify the charge and spin Hall
effect of wallpaper fermions in the presence of the (anti)ferromagnetism.Based
on a four-sublattice model, we construct the effective Hamiltonian of wallpaper
fermions coupled with the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic moment.Both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic moments induce an energy gap for the
wallpaper fermions, leading to quantized (spin) Hall conductivity. The
ferromagnetic wallpaper fermion induces the Hall conductivity quantized into
$e^2/h$, which is twice that for a single Dirac fermion on the surface of
topological insulators. On the other hand, the spin Hall conductivity decays
and reaches to be a finite value as the antiferromagnetic coupling increases.
We also show that the results above are valid for a general model of wallpaper
fermions from symmetry consideration.

Reactive single-step hot-pressing at 1473 K and 35 MPa for 4 h produces
dense, bulk, near single-phase, low-cost and low-criticality
Fe$_2$Al$_{1.15}$B$_2$ and Fe$_2$Al$_{1.1}$B$_2$Ge$_{0.05}$Ga$_{0.05}$ MAB
samples, showing a second-order magnetic phase transition with favorable
magnetocaloric properties around room temperature. The magnetic as well as
magnetocaloric properties can be tailored upon Ge and Ga doping, leading to an
increase of Curie temperature $T_C$ and spontaneous magnetization $m_S$. The
maximum isothermal entropy change $\Delta s_{T,max}$ of hot-pressed
Fe$_2$Al$_{1.15}$B$_2$ in magnetic field changes of 2 and 5 T amounts to 2.5
and 5 J(kgK)$^{-1}$ at 287.5 K and increases by Ge and Ga addition to 3.1 and
6.2 J(kgK)$^{-1}$ at 306.5 K, respectively. The directly measured maximum
adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad,max}$ is improved by the composition
modification from 0.9 to 1.1 K in magnetic field changes of 1.93 T. Overall, we
demonstrate that hot-pressing provides a much faster, more scalable and
processing cost reducing alternative compared to conventional synthesis routes
to produce heat exchangers for magnetic cooling devices. Therefore, our
criticality assessment shows that hot-pressed Fe-based MAB phases provide a
promising compromise of material and processing cost, criticality and
magnetocaloric performance, demonstrating the potential for low-cost and
low-criticality magnetocaloric applications around room temperature.

Thermoelectricity is a next-generation solution for efficient waste heat
management. Although various thermoelectric materials exist, there is still a
lot of scope for advancement. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials,
including MXenes, showed promise as thermoelectric materials. The progress of
MXenes as magnificent thermoelectric materials is very well established in the
form of a tailor-made review. MXenes outstanding thermoelectric activity comes
from a unique band structure created from its atomically thin layers and the
defective surface of the external layers of atoms. Furthermore, the variety of
MXenes chemical composition and MXenes-based nanostructures facilitates the
research path based on energy band engineering, optimization, carrier
concentration and mobility. The thermoelectric efficiency of MXenes has been
mapped over the landscape of other 2D and traditional thermoelectric materials.
Meanwhile, MBenes, the latest family member of the flatland, exhibits an
incredible diversity of structures with additional crystal symmetries. Owing to
the orthorhombic crystal structure, an in-plane structural anisotropy, and
hence, the in-plane dependent thermoelectric properties are plausible. As a
future prospective, certain strategies that can enhance the thermoelectric
performance of MBenes have been presented. In addition, few insights and
challenges that have to be considered to overcome the limitations in the
thermoelectric field have been debated.

<h3>Fermi Surface and Lifshitz Transitions of a Ferromagnetic Superconductor  under External Magnetic Fields</h3>

<br>
Lifshitz transitions are being increasingly recognised as significant in a
wide variety of strongly correlated and topological materials, and
understanding the origin and influence of Lifshitz transitions is leading to
deeper understanding of key aspects of magnetic, transport or quantum critical
behavior. In the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe, a magnetic field applied
along the c-axis has been shown to induce a series of anomalies in both
transport and thermopower that may be caused by Lifshitz transitions. The need
to understand the subtleties of the relationship between magnetism,
superconductivity and a heavy electron Fermi surface in the ferromagnetic
superconductors makes it important to explore if and why a series of
magnetic-field-induced Lifshitz transitions occurs in UCoGe. Here we report
magnetic susceptibility measurements of UCoGe, performed at temperatures down
to 45 mK and magnetic fields (B ||c) up to 30 T. We observe a series of
clearly-defined features in the susceptibility, and multiple sets of strongly
field-dependent de Haas-van Alphen oscillations, from which we extract detailed
field-dependence of the quasiparticle properties. We complement our
experimental results with density functional theory bandstructure calculations,
and include a simple model of the influence of magnetic field on the calculated
Fermi surface. By comparing experimental and calculated results, we determine
the likely shape of the Fermi surface and identify candidate Lifshitz
transitions that could correspond to two of the features in susceptibility. We
connect these results to the development of magnetization in the system.

<h3>Three-dimensional Van Hove singularity with divergent density of states  in a topological magnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
Arising from the extreme or saddle point in electronic bands, Van Hove
singularity (VHS) strongly enhances the electronic correlation in its vicinity
and leads to various new states of matter such as density wave and
unconventional superconductivity. In contrast to the divergent density of
states (DOS) in one and two dimensions, the VHS is generally non-divergent in
three dimension (3D). Here we report the observation of divergent 3D VHS in a
topological magnet EuCd2As2 by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. The divergent 3D
VHS is generated by substantially tuning the energy dispersion and momentum
distribution of the Weyl bands. Applying the external magnetic field allows
effective control of exchange interaction between itinerant electrons and local
magnetic moments. As a result, the 3D Weyl bands are found to shift
continuously with the canting of magnetic moment, which leads to the gradual
increase of Fermi velocity. Above the critical field Bc ~ 0.6 T, the formation
of a divergent 3D VHS is evidenced by the abrupt spectral emergence of the
inter-band transitions. This type of VHS allows in situ tunability by external
magnetic fields with adjustable energy position, DOS and even its presence. The
experimental spectrum and the emergence of 3D VHS can be quantitatively
described by a two-band minimal model of Weyl semimetal with the exchange
interaction. The deduced model predicts three additional optical transitions
and their energy crossings, which are quantitatively verified by the
magneto-near-infrared spectrum. Our results pave the way to exploring divergent
VHS in the 3D systems with strong tunability and provide a platform to uncover
the coordination between electronic correlation and the topological phase.

propylmethacrylate (TPM) colloidal suspensions for three-dimensional confocal
microscopy. We revisit a simple synthesis of TPM microspheres by nucleation of
droplets from pre-hydrolyzed TPM oil in a 'zero-flow' regime, and demonstrate
how precise and reproducible control of particle size may be achieved via
single-step nucleation with a focus on how the reagents are mixed. We also
revamp the conventional dyeing method for TPM particles to achieve uniform
transfer of a fluorophore to the organosilica droplets, improving particle
identification. Finally, we illustrate how a ternary mixture of tetralin,
trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene may be used as a suspension medium
which matches the refractive index of these particles while allowing
independent control of the density mismatch between particle and solvent.

Ferroelectric memories experienced a revival in the last decade due to the
discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$-based nanometer-thick thin films.
These films exhibit exceptional silicon compatibility, overcoming the scaling
and integration obstacles that impeded perovskite ferroelectrics' use in
high-density integrated circuits. The exact phase responsible for
ferroelectricity in hafnia films remains debated with no single factor
identified that could stabilize the ferroelectric phase thermodynamically.
Here, supported by density functional theory (DFT) high-throughput (HT)
calculations that screen a broad range of epitaxial conditions, we demonstrate
conclusively that specific epitaxial conditions achievable with common
substrates such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and SrTiO$_3$ can favor the
polar Pca2$_1$ phase thermodynamically over other polar phases such as R3m and
Pmn2$_1$ and nonpolar P2$_1$/c phase. The substrate's symmetry
constraint-induced shear strain is crucial for the preference of Pca2$_1$. The
strain-stability phase diagrams resolve experiment-theory discrepancies and can
guide the improvement of ferroelectric properties of epitaxial hafnia thin
films.

<br>
<br>
While BiFeO3-based solid solutions show great promise for applications in
energy conversion and storage, realizing this promise necessitates
understanding the structure-property relationship in particular pertaining to
the relaxor-like characteristics often exhibited by solid solutions with
polar-to-non-polar morphotropic phase boundaries. To this end, we investigated
the role of the compositionally-driven relaxor state in (100-x)BiFeO3-xSrTiO3
[BFO-xSTO], via in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction under bipolar
electric-field cycling. The electric-field induced changes to the crystal
structure, phase fraction and domain textures were monitored via the {111}pc,
{200}pc, and 1/2{311}pc Bragg peaks. The dynamics of the intensities and
positions of the (111) and (11-1) reflections reveal an initial non-ergodic
regime followed by long-range ferroelectric ordering after extended poling
cycles. The increased degree of random multi-site occupation in BFO-42STO
compared to BFO-35STO is correlated with an increase of the critical electric
field needed to induce the non-ergodic-to-ferroelectric transition, and a
decrease in the degree of domain reorientation. Although both compositions show
an irreversible transition to a long-range ferroelectric state, our results
suggest that the weaker ferroelectric response in BFO-42STO is related to an
increase in ergodicity. This, in turn, serves to guide the development of
BFO-based systems into promising platform for further property engineering
towards specific capacitor applications.

The control of a superconducting current via the application of a gate
voltage has been recently demonstrated in a variety of superconducting devices.
Although the mechanism underlying this gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS)
effect remains under debate, the GCS effect has raised great interest for the
development of the superconducting equivalent of conventional metal-oxide
semiconductor electronics. To date, however, the GCS effect has been mostly
observed in superconducting devices made by additive patterning. Here, we show
that devices made by subtractive patterning show a systematic absence of the
GCS effect. Doing a microstructural analysis of these devices and comparing
them to devices made by additive patterning, where we observe a GCS, we
identify some material and physical parameters that are crucial for the
observation of a GCS. We also show that some of the mechanisms proposed to
explain the origin of the GCS effect are not universally relevant.

We investigate topological superconductivity in the Rashba-Hubbard model,
describing heavy-atom superlattice and van der Waals materials with broken
inversion. We focus in particular on fillings close to the van Hove
singularities, where a large density of states enhances the superconducting
transition temperature. To determine the topology of the superconducting gaps
and to analyze the stability of their surface states in the presence of
disorder and residual interactions, we develop an fRG+MFT approach, which
combines the unbiased functional renormalization group (fRG) with a real-space
mean-field theory (MFT). Our approach uncovers a cascade of topological
superconducting states, including $A_1$ and $B_1$ pairings, whose wave
functions are of dominant $p$- and $d$-wave character, respectively, as well as
a time-reversal breaking $A_1 + i B_1$ pairing. While the $A_1$ and $B_1$
states have first order topology with helical and flat-band Majorana states,
respectively, the $A_1 + i B_1$ pairing exhibits second-order topology with
Majorana corner modes. Implications for experimental systems and potential
applications for quantum technologies are being discussed.

Volterra's definition of dislocations in crystals distinguishes edge and
screw defects geometrically, according to whether the Burgers vector is
perpendicular or parallel to the defect. Here, we demonstrate a distinction
between screw and edge dislocations that enables a unified, purely topological
means of classification. Our construction relies on the construction of real or
virtual disclination-line pairs at the core of the dislocation in a smectic and
can be generalized to crystals with triply-periodic order. The connection
between topology and geometry is exploited.

Different classes of low-dimensional superconducting systems exhibit an
inhomogeneous filamentary superconducting condensate whose macroscopic
coherence still needs to be fully investigated and understood. Here we present
a thorough analysis of the superfluid response of a prototypical filamentary
superconductor embedded in a {two-dimensional} metallic matrix. By mapping the
system into an exactly solvable random impedance network, we show how the
dissipative (reactive) response of the system non-trivially depends on both the
macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the metallic (superconducting)
fraction. We compare our calculations with resonant-microwave transport
measurements performed on LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures over an extended
range of temperatures and carrier densities finding that the filamentary
character of superconductivity accounts for unusual peculiar features of the
experimental data.

<br>
<br>
Exciton energy structure and population dynamics in a wide CdTe/CdZnTe
quantum well are studied by spectrally-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy.
Multiple excitonic resonances in reflectance spectra are observed and
identified by solving numerically three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. The
pump-probe reflectivity signal is shown to be dominated by the photoinduced
nonradiative broadening of the excitonic resonances, while pump-induced exciton
energy shift and reduction of the oscillator strength appear to be negligible.
This broadening is induced by the reservoir of dark excitons with large
in-plane wave vector, which are coupled to the the bright excitons states. The
dynamics of the pump-induced nonradiative broadening observed experimentally is
characterised by three components: signal build up on the scale of tens of
picoseconds (i) and bi-exponential decay on the scale of one nanosecond (ii)
and ten nanosecons (iii). Possible mechanisms of the reservoir population and
depletion responsible for this behaviour are discussed.

Strontium ruthenate Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is an unconventional superconductor whose
pairing symmetry has not been fully clarified, despite more than two decades of
intensive research. Recent NMR Knight shift experiments have rekindled the
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ pairing debate by giving strong evidence against all odd-parity
pairing states, including chiral $p$-wave pairing that was for a long time the
leading pairing candidate. Here, we exclude additional pairing states by
analyzing recent elastocaloric measurements [YS. Li et al., Nature 607,
276--280 (2022)]. To be able to explain the elastocaloric experiment, we find
that unconventional even-parity pairings must include either large $d_{x^2 -
y^2}$-wave or large $\{d_{xz} \mid d_{yz}\}$-wave admixtures, where the latter
possibility arises because of the body-centered point group symmetry. These
$\{d_{xz} \mid d_{yz}\}$-wave admixtures take the form of distinctively
body-centered-periodic harmonics that have horizontal line nodes. Hence
$g_{xy(x^2-y^2)}$-wave and $d_{xy}$-wave pairings are excluded as possible
dominant even pairing states.

We investigate the effect of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions in the
planar pyrochlore (checkerboard) antiferromagnet, one of the paradigmatic
models of spin frustration, and establish the classical phase diagram using a
combination of analytical and numerical approaches. While anisotropic
interactions generally tend to remove the frustration, here we show that a high
degree of frustration survives in a large region of the phase diagram. In
conjunction with the fixed handedness introduced by the DM anisotropy, this
spawns a cascade of incommensurate and double-twisted multi-domain phases,
consisting of spatially intertwined domains of the underlying competing phases
of the isotropic frustrated point. The results underpin a novel mechanism of
generating multi-Q phases in systems that combine high degree of frustration
and chiral interactions.

The axion is expected to solve the strong CP problem of quantum
chromodynamics and is one of the leading candidates for dark matter. CAPP in
South Korea has several axion search experiments based on cavity haloscopes in
the frequency range of 1-6 GHz. The main effort focuses on operation of the
experiments with the highest possible sensitivity. It requires maintenance of
the haloscopes at the lowest physical temperature in the range of mK and usage
of low noise components to amplify the weak axion signal. We report development
and operation of low noise amplifiers for 5 haloscope experiments targeting at
different frequency ranges. The amplifiers show noise temperatures approaching
the quantum limit.

Emergent Dirac fermions provide the starting point to understanding the
plethora of novel condensed matter phases. The nature of the associated phases
and phase transitions crucially depends on both the emergent symmetries as well
as the implementation of the microscopic ones on the low-energy Dirac fermions.
Here, we show that $j=3/2$ electrons in spin-orbit coupled materials on
honeycomb lattice can give rise to SU(8) symmetric Dirac semimetals with
symmetry implementation very different from that of graphene. This non-trivial
embedding of the microscopic symmetries in the low energy is reflected in the
nature of phases proximate to the Dirac semimetal. Such phases can arise from
finite short-range electron-electron interactions. In particular, we identify
24 such phases - divided into three classes - and their low energy properties
obtained by condensing particle-number conserving fermion bilinears that break
very different microscopic symmetries and/or are topologically protected by
symmetries. The latter includes interesting generalisations of quantum
spin-Hall phases. Remarkably some of the resultant phases still support a
sub-set of gapless fermions - protected by a sub-group of SU(8) - resulting in
interesting density wave semimetals. Near the phase transitions to such density
wave semimetals, the surviving gapless fermions strongly interact with the
bosonic order parameter field and give rise to novel quantum critical points.
Our study is applicable to a wide class of $d^1$ and $d^3$ transition metals
with strong spin-orbit coupling and predicts that such materials can harbour a
very rich interplay of symmetries and competing interactions in the
intermediate correlation regime.

Despite decades of intensive experimental and theoretical efforts, the
physics of cuprate high-temperature superconductors in general and, in
particular, the nature of the normal state, is still under debate. Numerous
collective excitations arising from the proximity to two other phases, magnetic
and charge density waves, make it difficult to elucidate their origin.
Here, we report our investigation of low-energy charge excitations in the
normal state. We find that the peculiarities of the electronic band structure
at low energies have a profound impact on the nature of the intraband
collective modes. We show that it gives rise to a new kind of modes with huge
intensity and non-Lorentzian spectral function in addition to well-known
collective excitations like conventional plasmons and spin-fluctuation. We
predict the existence of two such modes with maximal spectral weight in the
nodal and antinodal directions. Additionally, we found a long-living
quasi-one-dimensional plasmon becoming an intense soft mode over an extended
momentum range along the antinodal direction. These modes might explain some of
the RIXS data and might also contribute to the strong renormalization of
quasiparticles in high-$T_c$ cuprates in these regions.

The Kondo insulator state (KIS) is among the least understood phase state in
condensed matter physics. KIS is the state of the electron liquid in the Kondo
lattice at half filling, is studied within the mean field approach. We
demonstrate, that $Z_2$-field, which is formed by electrons and local moments,
leads to the state of the Kondo insulator in a lattice with a double cell. In
the ground state, electrons and local moments form singlets; in this case, no
spin or charge density waves are realized in a lattice with a double cell. We
have shown that a Majorana-type gap spectrum of the quasi-particle excitations
is realized in $Z_2$-field.8 pages The gap in the spectrum decreases with
increasing external magnetic field; it closes at a critical value at the
insulator-metal phase transition point. Thus, the introduction of the $Z_2$
-field allows you to answer the key question what is the ground state of KIS.

Transformers are the type of neural networks that has revolutionised natural
language processing and protein science. Their key building block is a
mechanism called self-attention which is trained to predict missing words in
sentences. Despite the practical success of transformers in applications it
remains unclear what self-attention learns from data, and how. Here, we give a
precise analytical and numerical characterisation of transformers trained on
data drawn from a generalised Potts model with interactions between sites and
Potts colours. While an off-the-shelf transformer requires several layers to
learn this distribution, we show analytically that a single layer of
self-attention with a small modification can learn the Potts model exactly in
the limit of infinite sampling. We show that this modified self-attention, that
we call ``factored'', has the same functional form as the conditional
probability of a Potts spin given the other spins, compute its generalisation
error using the replica method from statistical physics, and derive an exact
mapping to pseudo-likelihood methods for solving the inverse Ising and Potts
problem.

We study the motion of superfluid vortices with filled massive cores.
Previous point-vortex models already pointed out the impact of the core mass on
the vortex dynamical properties, but relied on an assumption that is
questionable in many physical systems where the immiscibility condition is
barely satisfied: the fact that the massive core always lays at the very bottom
of the effective confining potential constituted by the hosting vortex. Here,
we relax this assumption and present a new point-vortex model where quantum
vortices are harmonically coupled to their massive cores. We thoroughly explore
the new dynamical regimes offered by this improved model; we then show that the
functional dependence of the system normal modes on the microscopic parameters
can be correctly interpreted only within this new generalized framework. Our
predictions are benchmarked against the numerical simulations of coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations for a realistic mixture of atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates.

Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically
floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain.
Following our recently-developed analytical theory for the athermal limit, here
and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to under-constrained systems
at finite temperatures close to the athermal transition point. We derive from
first principles the partition sum for a broad class of under-constrained
systems, from which we obtain analytic expressions for elastic material
properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ in terms of
isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, shear strain $\gamma$, and temperature $T$. Our
work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers & networks,
membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.

Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically
floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain, which
is theoretically well understood. Here and in the companion paper, we extend
this theory to finite temperatures for a very broad class of under-constrained
systems. In the vicinity of the athermal transition point, we derive from first
principles expressions for elastic properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and
shear modulus $G$ on temperature $T$, isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, and shear
strain $\gamma$, which we confirm numerically. These expressions contain only
three parameters, which depend on the microscopic structure of the system.
These respectively describe entropic rigidity, energetic rigidity, and an
interaction between isotropic and shear strain. Our results imply that in
under-constrained systems, entropic and energetic rigidity interact like two
springs in series. This also allows for a simple explanation of the previously
observed scaling relation $t\sim G\sim T^{1/2}$ at $\varepsilon=\gamma=0$. Our
work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers & networks,
membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.

<h3>Realizing Majorana zero modes in magnetic field-free InAs-Al nanowires  with fewer growth constraints</h3>

Common proposals for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana
zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrids require large magnetic
fields, which paradoxically suppress the superconducting gap of the parent
superconductor. Although two-channel schemes have been proposed as a way to
eliminate magnetic fields, geometric constraints make their implementation
challenging, since the channels should be immersed in nearly antiparallel
electric fields. Here, we propose an experimentally favorable scheme for
realizing field-free topological superconductivity, in two-channel InAs-Al
nanowires, that overcomes such growth constraints. Crucially, we show that
antiparallel fields are not required, if the channels are energetically
detuned. We compute topological phase diagrams for realistically modeled
nanowires, finding a broad range of parameters that could potentially harbor
Majorana zero modes. This work, therefore, solves a major technical challenge
and opens the door to near-term experiments.
