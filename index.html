Interacting mixtures of bosons and fermions are ubiquitous in nature. They
form the backbone of the standard model of physics, provide a framework for
understanding quantum materials such as unconventional superconductors and
two-dimensional electronic systems, and are of technological importance in
$^3$He/$^4$He dilution refrigerators. Bose-Fermi mixtures are predicted to
exhibit an intricate phase diagram featuring coexisting liquids, supersolids,
composite fermions, coupled superfluids, and quantum phase transitions in
between. However, their coupled thermodynamics and collective behavior
challenge our understanding, in particular for strong boson-fermion
interactions. Clean realizations of fully controllable systems are scarce.
Ultracold atomic gases offer an ideal platform to experimentally investigate
Bose-Fermi mixtures, as the species concentration and interaction strengths can
be freely tuned. Here, we study the collective oscillations of a spin-polarized
Fermi gas immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a function of the
boson-fermion interaction strength and temperature. Remarkably, for strong
interspecies interactions the fermionic collective excitations evolve to
perfectly mimic the bosonic superfluid collective modes, and fermion flow
becomes dissipationless. With increasing number of thermal excitations in the
Bose gas, the fermions' dynamics exhibit a crossover from the collisionless to
the hydrodynamic regime, reminiscent of the emergence of hydrodynamics in
two-dimensional electron fluids. Our findings open the door towards
understanding non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly interacting Bose-Fermi
mixtures.

<h3>Controllable switch of dissolution kinetics mechanism in drug  microcapsules</h3>

Controllable continuous release of functional materials from capsules is one
of the unmet functions of theragnosis particles; on this way, understanding
cargo-fluid interactions in vitro is an essential milestone. We develop a
flexible platform to investigate single particle-fluid interactions utilizing a
glass micropipette as a highly localized flow source around an optically
trapped particle. In proof-of-concept experiments this microparticle is
sensitive to local microflows distribution, thus serving as a probe. The very
same flows are capable of the particle rotating (i.e., vaterite drug cargo) at
frequencies dependent on the mutual particle-pipette position. The platform
flexibility comes from different interactions of a tweezer (optical forces) and
a pipette (mechanical/hydrodynamical) with micro-particle, which makes this
arrangement an ideal micro-tool. We studied the vaterite dissolution kinetics
and demonstrated it can be controlled on demand, providing a wide cargo release
dynamic rate. Our results promote using inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles as a
nanomedicine platform.

<h3>Upper bounds on superconducting and excitonic phase-stiffness for  interacting isolated narrow bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07318</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Inspired by the discovery of superconductivity in moir\'e materials with
isolated narrow bandwidth electronic bands, here we analyze critically the
question of what is the maximum attainable $T_c$ in interacting flat-band
systems. We focus specifically on the low-energy effective theory, where the
density-density interactions are projected to the set of partially-filled flat
bands. The resulting problem is inherently non-perturbative, where the standard
mean-field approximation is not applicable. Here we develop further our recent
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation based approach (PNAS, 120 (11), e2217816120
(2023)) to compute the effective electromagnetic response and the
superconducting phase-stiffness in terms of "projected" gauge-transformations,
and extend the formalism to compute the stiffness for excitonic superfluids.
Importantly, our method requires neither any "wannierization" for the narrow
bands of interest, regardless of their (non-)topological character, nor any
knowledge of an underlying pairing-symmetry, and can be setup directly in
momentum-space. We use this formalism to derive upper bounds on the
phase-stiffness for sign-problem-free models, where their values are known
independently from numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo computations. We also
illustrate the analytical structure of these bounds for the superconducting and
excitonic phase-stiffness for perfectly flat-bands that have Landau-level-like
wavefunctions.

<h3>Microscopic theory of colour in lutetium hydride</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07326" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07326</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride has recently been proposed as a near-ambient
conditions superconductor. Interestingly, the sample transforms from blue to
pink to red as a function of pressure, but only the pink phase is
superconducting. Subsequent experimental studies have failed to reproduce the
superconductivity, but have confirmed the existence of pressure-driven colour
changes. However, these colour changes appear in different sequences and at
different pressures depending on the experiment, with observed colours
including blue, pink, red, violet, and orange. Given the relationship between
colour and superconductivity, understanding colour changes in nitrogen-doped
lutetium hydride may hold the key to clarifying the possible superconductivity
in this compound. Here, we describe a full microscopic theory of colour in
lutetium hydride. We find that hydrogen-deficient LuH$_2$ is the only phase
which exhibits colour changes under pressure consistent with experimental
reports, with a sequence blue-violet-pink-red-orange. We also find that the
concentration of hydrogen vacancies controls the precise sequence and pressure
of colour changes, rationalising seemingly contradictory experiments. Nitrogen
doping also modifies the colour of LuH$_2$ but it plays a secondary role
compared to hydrogen vacancies. Therefore, we propose hydrogen-deficient
LuH$_2$ as the key phase for exploring the superconductivity claim in the
lutetium-hydrogen system. Finally, we find no phonon-mediated superconductivity
near room temperature in the pink phase.

<h3>Phase diagram of the spin $S$, SU($N$) antiferromagnet on a square  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07329" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07329</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas Schwab, Francesco Parisen Toldin, Fakher F. Assaad</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the ground state phase diagram of an SU($N$)-symmetric
antiferromagnetic spin model on a square lattice where each site hosts an
irreducible representation of SU($N$) described by a square Young tableau of
$N/2$ rows and $2S$ columns. We show that negative sign free fermion Monte
Carlo simulations can be carried out for this class of quantum magnets at any
$S$ and even values of $N$. In the large-$N$ limit, the saddle point
approximation favors a four-fold degenerate valence bond solid phase. In the
large $S$-limit, the semi-classical approximation points to N\'eel state. On a
line set by $N=8S + 2$ in the $S$ versus $N$ phase diagram, we observe a
variety of phases proximate to the N\'eel state. At $S = 1/2$ and $3/2$ we
observe the aforementioned four fold degenerate valence bond solid state. At
$S=1$ a two fold degenerate spin nematic state in which the C$_4$ lattice
symmetry is broken down to C$_2$ emerges. Finally at $S=2$ we observe a unique
ground state that pertains to a two-dimensional version of the
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. For our specific realization, this symmetry
protected topological state is characterized by an SU(18), $S=1/2$ boundary
state, that has a dimerized ground state. These phases that are proximate to
the N\'eel state are consistent with the notion of monopole condensation of the
antiferromagnetic order parameter. In particular one expects spin disordered
states with degeneracy set by $\text{mod}(4,2S)$.

<h3>The Spectrum of Interstitial Solute Energies in Polycrystals</h3>

A computational method is presented to measure the spectrum of segregation
energies for an interstitial solute at grain boundaries (GBs) in a polycrystal.
For the Pd-H system, that spectrum of GB interstitial segregation energies is
found to consist of a mixture of two normal-like distributions, characteristic
of GB octahedral and tetrahedral sites. We also derive a thermodynamic isotherm
to calculate the equilibrium segregation state in a polycrystal that recognizes
the need for referencing two interstitial site types, and show that it conforms
well to experimental data in the Pd-H system.

<h3>Magnetic properties of a spin-orbit entangled Jeff=1/2 three-dimensional  frustrated rare-earth hyperkagome</h3>

The interplay between competing degrees of freedom can stabilize non-trivial
magnetic states in correlated electron materials. Frustration-induced strong
quantum fluctuations can evade long-range magnetic ordering leading to exotic
quantum states such as spin liquids in two-dimensional spin-lattices such as
triangular and kagome structures. However, the experimental realization of
dynamic and correlated quantum states is rare in three-dimensional (3D)
frustrated magnets wherein quantum fluctuations are less prominent. Herein, we
report the crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility, electron spin resonance
and specific heat studies on a 3D frustrated magnet Yb3Sc2Ga3O12. In this
material, Yb3+ ions form a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing
triangles known as hyperkagome lattice without any detectable anti-site
disorder. Our thermodynamic results reveal a low energy state with Jeff = 1=2
degrees of freedom in the Kramers doublet state. The zero field-cooled and
field cooled magnetic susceptibility taken in 0.001 T rules out the presence of
spin-freezing down to 1.8 K. The Curie-Weiss fit to low temperature
susceptibility data yields a small and negative Curie-Weiss temperature
indicating the presence of a weak antiferromagnetic interaction between Jeff =
1=2 (Yb3+) moments. The Yb-electron spin resonance displays a broad line of
non-Lorentzian shape that suggests considerable magnetic anisotropy in
Yb3Sc2Ga3O12. The absence of long-range magnetic ordering inferred from
specific heat data indicates a dynamic liquid-like ground state at least down
to 130 mK. Furthermore, zero field specific heat shows a broad maximum around
200 mK suggesting the presence of short-range spin correlations in this
three-dimensional frustrated antiferromagnet.

<h3>Modelling thermoresponsive polymer brush by mesoscale computer  simulations</h3>

We consider a functional surface comprising thermoresponsive polymer chains,
the material that has found numerous technological and biomedical applications.
However, to achieve the required time and length scales for computer modelling
of such applications, one is forced to use coarse-grained mesoscopic modelling
approaches. The model used here is based on the previous work [Soto-Figueroa et
al., Soft Matter, 8, 1871 (2012)], and it mimics the principal feature of the
poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), namely, the rapid change of its
hydrophilicity at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). For the case
of an isolated chain, we discuss scaling properties of the radius of gyration,
end-to-end distance, various distribution functions, and the density profile of
monomers below and above the LCST. For the case of the model thermoresposive
brush, we search for the optimal grafting density at which the change in brush
height, upon crossing the LCST, reaches its maximum value. The interpretation
of the thermoresponse, in terms of the Alexander-de Gennes blobs and the level
of solvation of polymer chains in a brush, are provided.

<h3>Möbius carbon nanobelts interacting with heavy metal nanoclusters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07368</a>
<br>
<i>C. Aguiar, N. Dattani, I. Camps</i>
<br>
<br>
To investigate the interaction between carbon and Mobius-type carbon
nanobelts and nickel, cadmium, and lead nanoclusters, we utilized the
semiempirical tight binding framework provided by xTB software. Through our
calculations, we determined the lowest energy geometries, complexes stability,
binding energy, and electronic properties. Our findings demonstrate that heavy
metal nanoclusters have a favorable binding affinity towards both nanobelts,
with the Mobius-type nanobelt having a stronger interaction. Additionally, our
calculations reveal that the nickel nanocluster has the lowest binding energy,
displaying the greatest charge transfer with the nanobelts, which was nearly
twice that of the cadmium and lead nanoclusters.
The molecular dynamic simulation showed that all complexes were stable at
298K, with low root-mean-square deviation and negative binding energy.
Homogeneous distribution of the frontier orbitals throughout the nanobelt
structure was observed, with slight changes noted in the distribution when the
structure was twisted to create the Mobius-type nanobelt. Furthermore, the
topological study demonstrated that although the number of bonds between the
metal nanoclusters and the Mobius-type nanobelt were the same, the bond
intensities were notably different. Bonds formed with the nickel nanocluster
were stronger than those formed with cadmium and lead metals. Our combined
results lead to the conclusion that the nickel nanoclusters are chemisorbed,
whereas cadmium and lead nanoclusters are physisorbed in both nanobelts.

<h3>Nonergodic Brownian oscillator: High-frequency response</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07371" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07371</a>
<br>
<i>Alex V. Plyukhin</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a Brownian oscillator whose coupling to the environment may lead
to the formation of a localized normal mode. For lower values of the
oscillator's natural frequency, $\omega\le\omega_c$, the localized mode is
absent and the unperturbed oscillator reaches thermal equilibrium. For higher
values of $\omega>\omega_c$, when the localized mode is formed, the unperturbed
oscillator does not thermalize but rather evolves into a nonequilibrium
cyclostationary state. We consider the response of such an oscillator to an
external periodic force. Despite the coupling to the environment, the
oscillator shows the unbounded resonance (with the response linearly increasing
with time) when the frequency of the external force coincides with the
frequency of the localized mode. An unusual resonance (``quasi-resonance")
occurs for the oscillator with the critical value of the natural frequency
$\omega=\omega_c$, which separates thermalizing (ergodic) and non-thermalizing
(nonergodic) configurations. In that case the resonance response increases with
time sublinearly, which can be interpreted as a resonance between the external
force and the incipient localized mode.

<h3>A Gauge-Invariant Measure of the Magnon Orbital Angular Momentum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07379</a>
<br>
<i>Randy S. Fishman</i>
<br>
<br>
Unlike the Berry phase, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of magnons with
two-dimensional wavevector k in band n is not gauge invariant for arbitrary
phase lambda_n(k). However, by integrating the OAM over the orientation $\phi $
of wavevector k, we construct a gauge-invariant function F_n(k). Like F_n(k),
the average OAM for magnon band n in a circle of radius k is also gauge
invariant. We demonstrate these results for a ferromagnet on a honeycomb
lattice with Dzyalloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next-nearest neighbor
spins. With wavevectors k restricted to the first Brillouin zone, the angular
averaged OAM F_n(k) then has opposite signs for lower and upper bands n=1 and 2
for all k.

<h3>Controlled catalyst transfer polymerization in graphene nanoribbon  synthesis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07394" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07394</a>
<br>
<i>Sai Ho Pun, Aidan Delgado, Christina Dadich, Adam Cronin, Felix R. Fischer</i>
<br>
<br>
Exercising direct control over the unusual electronic structures arising from
quantum confinement effects in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) - atomically defined
quasi one-dimensional (1D) strips of graphene - is intimately linked to
geometric boundary conditions imposed by the bonding within the ribbon. Besides
composition and position of substitutional dopant atoms, the symmetry of the
unit cell, the width, length, and termination of a GNR are integral factors
that collectively can give rise to highly tuneable semiconductors, innate
metallicity arising from topological zero-mode engineering, or magnetic
ordering in spin-polarized lattices. Here we present a rational design that
integrates each of these interdependent variables within a modular bottom-up
synthesis. Our hybrid chemical approach relies on a catalyst transfer
polymerization (CTP) that establishes uniform control over length, width, and
end-groups. Complemented by a surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation step,
uniquely enabled by matrix-assisted direct (MAD) transfer protocols, geometry
and functional handles encoded in a polymer template are faithfully mapped onto
the structure of the corresponding GNR. Bond-resolved scanning tunnelling
microscopy (BRSTM) and spectroscopy (STS) validate the robust correlation
between polymer template design and GNR electronic structure and provide a
universal and modular platform for the systematic exploration and seamless
integration of functional GNRs with integrated circuit architectures.

<h3>Quantifying Dynamic Tilting in Halide Perovskites: Chemical Trends and  Local Correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07402</a>
<br>
<i>Julia Wiktor, Erik Fransson, Dominik Kubicki, Paul Erhart</i>
<br>
<br>
Halide perovskites have emerged as one of the most interesting materials for
optoelectronic applications due to their favorable properties, such as
defect-tolerance and long charge carrier lifetimes, which are attributed to
their dynamic softness. However, this softness has led to apparent
disagreements between the local instantaneous and global average structures of
these materials. In this work, we assess the local tilt angles of octahedra in
the perovskite structure through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations
using machine learned potentials based on density functional theory. We compare
structural properties given by different density functionals, namely PBE,
PBEsol, SCAN, and vdW-DF-cx, and establish trends across a family of CsMX3 with
M=Sn or Pb and X=Cl, Br or I perovskites. Notably, we demonstrate a strong
short-range ordering that persists even in the cubic phase of halide
perovskites. This ordering is reminiscent of the tetragonal phase and bridges
the disordered local structure and the global cubic arrangement. Our results
provide a deeper understanding of the structural properties of halide
perovskites and their local distortions, which is crucial for further
understanding their optoelectronic properties.

<h3>Instability and Momentum Bifurcation of molecular BEC in Exotic  Dispersion with Shaken Lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07423</a>
<br>
<i>Kaiyue Wang, Feng Xiong, Yun Long, Yun Ma, Colin V. Parker</i>
<br>
<br>
We place a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in a 1D shaken lattice with a
Floquet-engineered dispersion, and observe the dynamics in both position and
momentum space. At the initial condition of zero momentum, our engineered
dispersion is inverted, and therefore unstable. We observe that the condensate
is destabilized by the lattice shaking as expected, but rather than decaying
incoherently or producing jets, as in other unstable condensates, under our
conditions the condensate bifurcates into two portions in momentum space, with
each portion subsequently following semi-classical trajectories. We can model
the evolution with a Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which suggests the origin of
the bifurcation lies in the development of relatively long-wavelength density
corrugation. We propose that this relatively clean bifurcation in momentum
space has application for counter-diabatic preparation of exotic ground states
in many-body quantum simulation schemes

<h3>magnetoARPES: Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy with Magnetic  Field Control</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07431" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07431</a>
<br>
<i>Sae Hee Ryu, Garett Reichenbach, Chris M. Jozwiak, Aaron Bostwick, Peter Richter, Thomas Seyller, Eli Rotenberg</i>
<br>
<br>
Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) is a premier technique for
understanding the electronic excitations in conductive, crystalline matter, in
which the induced photocurrent is collected and dispersed in energy and angle
of emission to reveal the energy- and momentum-dependent single particle
spectral function $A(\mathbf{k},\omega)$. So far, ARPES in a magnetic field has
been precluded due to the need to preserve the electron paths between the
sample and detector. In this paper we report progress towards "magnetoARPES", a
variant of ARPES that can be conducted in a magnetic field. It is achieved by
applying a microscopic probe beam ($\lesssim$ 10 $\mu$m ) to a thinned sample
mounted upon a special sample holder that generates magnetic field confined to
a thin layer near the sample surface. In this geometry we could produce ARPES
in magnetic fields up to around $\pm$ 100 mT. The magnetic fields can be varied
from purely in-plane to nearly purely out-of-plane, by scanning the probe beam
across different parts of the device. We present experimental and simulated
data for graphene to explore the aberrations induced by the magnetic field.
These results demonstrate the viability of the magnetoARPES technique for
exploring symmetry breaking effects in weak magnetic fields.

<h3>Electromagnetic response of superconductors in mean-field approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07432</a>
<br>
<i>Chang-geun Oh, Haruki Watanabe</i>
<br>
<br>
In the standard mean-field treatment of superconductors, the
electron-electron interactions are assumed to be written in terms of local
density operators. However, more general interactions, such as pair-hopping
interactions, may exist or may be generated in a low-energy effective
Hamiltonian. In this work, we study the effect of correlated hopping
interactions toward the electromagnetic response of superconductors. When only
the Hamiltonian after the mean-field approximation is provided, one cannot
unambiguously determine its electromagnetic response whenever such interactions
are allowed. We find that additional terms in the current operator are
generated and the Meissner weight and the optical conductivities are modified
from the textbook results.

<h3>Unavoidable emergent biaxiality in chiral molecular-colloidal hybrid  liquid crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07447</a>
<br>
<i>Jin-Sheng Wu, Marina Torres Lazaro, Souvik Ghosh, Haridas Mundoor, Henricus H. Wensink, Ivan I. Smalyukh</i>
<br>
<br>
Chiral nematic or cholesteric liquid crystals (LCs) are mesophases with
long-ranged orientational order featuring a quasi-layered periodicity imparted
by a helical configuration but lacking positional order. Doping molecular
cholesteric LCs with thin colloidal rods with a large length-to-width ratio or
disks with a large diameter-to-thickness ratio adds another level of complexity
to the system because of the interplay between weak surface boundary conditions
and bulk-based elastic distortions around the particle-LC interface. By using
colloidal disks and rods with different geometric shapes and boundary
conditions, we demonstrate that these anisotropic colloidal inclusions exhibit
biaxial orientational probability distributions, where they tend to orient with
the long rod axes and disk normals perpendicular to the helix axis, thus
imparting strong local biaxiality on the hybrid cholesteric LC structure.
Unlike the situation in achiral hybrid molecular-colloidal LCs, where biaxial
order emerges only at modest to high volume fractions of the anisotropic
colloidal particles, the orientational probability distribution of colloidal
inclusions immersed in chiral nematic hosts are unavoidably biaxial even at
vanishingly low particle volume fractions. In addition, the colloidal
inclusions induce local biaxiality in the molecular orientational order of the
LC host medium, which enhances the weak biaxiality of the LC in a chiral
nematic phase coming from the symmetry breaking caused by the presence of the
helical axis. With analytical modeling and computer simulations based on
minimizing the Landau de Gennes free energy of the host LC around the
colloidals, we explain our experimental findings and conclude that the biaxial
order of chiral molecular-colloidal LCs is strongly enhanced as compared to
both achiral molecular-colloidal LCs and molecular cholesteric LCs and is
rather unavoidable.

<h3>Unlocking Hidden Spins in Centrosymmetric SnSe2 by Vacancy-Controlled  Spin-Orbit Scattering</h3>

Spin current generation and manipulation remain the key challenge of
spintronics, in which relativistic spinorbit coupling (SOC) play a ubiquitous
role. In this letter, we demonstrate that hidden Rashba spins in the
non-magnetic, centrosymmetric lattice of multilayer SnSe2 can be efficiently
activated by spin-orbit scattering introduced by Se vacancies. Via vacancy
scattering, conduction electrons with hidden spin-momentum locked polarizations
acquire out-of-plane magnetization components, which effectively break the
chiral symmetry between the two Se sublattices of an SnSe2 monolayer when
electron spins start precession in the strong built-in Rashba SOC field. The
resulting spin separations are manifested in quantum transport as vacancy
concentrationand temperature-dependent crossovers from weak antilocalization
(WAL) to weak localization (WL), with the distinctive spin relaxation mechanism
of the Dyakonov-Perel type. Our study shows the great potential of
twodimensional systems with hidden-spin textures for spintronics.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in periodic potentials generate interesting
physics on the instabilities of Bloch states. The lowest-energy Bloch states of
BECs in pure nonlinear lattices are dynamically and Landau unstable, which
breaks down BEC superfluidity. In this paper we propose to use an out-of-phase
linear lattice to stabilize them. The stabilization mechanism is revealed by
the averaged interaction. We further incorporate a constant interaction into
BECs with mixed nonlinear and linear lattices, and reveal its effect on the
instabilities of Bloch states in the lowest band.

We investigate the total energies of spontaneous spin-valley polarized states
in bi-, tri- and tetralayer rhombohedral graphene where the Coulomb
correlations are accounted for within the random phase approximation. Our
analysis of the phase diagrams for varying carrier doping and perpendicular
electric fields shows that the exchange interaction between chiral electrons is
the main driver of spin-valley polarization, while the presence of Coulomb
correlations brings the flavor polarization phase boundaries to carrier
densities close to the complete filling of the Mexican hat shape top at the
Dirac points. We find that the tendency towards spontaneous spin-valley
polarization is enhanced with the chirality of the bands and therefore with
increasing number of layers.

The properties of inorganic nanomaterials in adsorption, catalysis, and
photoluminescence are commonly affected or dominated by particle size, surface
ligand, and ligand coverage; however, it has been long remaining challenging to
generally understand underlying physical and chemical principles with a unified
model. In this review the electronic-level principle that can unify the
structure-property relationships concerning nanomaterial surface science is
systematically illustrated, based on a chemisorption model through competitive
orbital redistribution from bulk energy bands into surface chemisorption bonds.
The physical nature of enhanced surface reactivity by size reduction lies in
weakening lattice confinement on surface atomic orbitals and amplifying the
effects of other structural factors such as defects. Nanoscale cooperative
chemisorption (NCC) model reveals the general physical principles driving size-
and coverage-dependent ligand-nanomaterial interactions owing to orbital
competitions between bulk energy bands and surface adsorption bonds. NCC theory
can interpret the impacts and trends of ligand-induced surface effects on
electronic states, bonding strength, and the emission energy and quantum yield
of both surface fluorescence like ligand-capped Au nanoclusters and bulk
intraband fluorescence like CdSe quantum dots. Competitive orbital
redistribution provides a new electronic perspective to unify the physical
principles driving nanomaterial surface science.

The presence of periodic modulation in graphene leads to a reconstruction of
the band structure and formation of minibands. In an external uniform magnetic
field, a fractal energy spectrum called Hofstadter butterfly is formed.
Particularly interesting in this regard are superlattices with tunable
modulation strength, such as electrostatically induced ones in graphene. We
perform transport modeling in gate-induced two-dimensional superlattice in
graphene and investigate the relation to the details of the band structure: in
low field via transverse magnetic focusing of fermions residing in minibands,
and at high field via the Hall conductivity corresponding the quantized
self-similar spectrum.

<h3>Linear dependence of $T_{c}$ on inter-site attraction in two-dimensional  extended Hubbard model</h3>

<br>

Recent experimental studies suggest that the minimal model for describing
cuprate superconductors is an extended Hubbard model with strong on-site
repulsion and nearest-neighbor attraction. This article studies the behavior of
the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ for this model using mean-field
theory, assuming that above $T_c$ the system is in a pure antiferromagnetic or
Fermi liquid phase, and below $T_c$ the superconducting order is subject to the
spatial modulation. The mean-field analysis reveals the fundamental difference
between cuprates and conventional metal-based superconductors, namely that the
energy scale of the effective bandwidth is comparable to $T_c$, resulting in an
almost linear dependence of optimal $T_c$ on the nearest-neighbor attraction.
Therefore, the mean-field theory provides a good qualitative description of the
superconducting problem in the extended Hubbard model and suggests that
sufficiently narrow bands and strong attractions are the two key factors for
designing high-$T_c$ superconducting materials.

Active gels play an important role in biology and in inspiring biomimetic
active materials, due to their ability to change shape, size and create their
own morphology; the relevant mechanics behind these changes is driven by
self-contraction and liquid flow. Here, we couple contraction and liquid flow
within a nonlinear mechanical model of an active gel disc to discuss how
contraction dynamics inherits length scales which are typical of the liquid
flow processes. The cylindrically symmetric model we present, which
recapitulate our previous theoretical modeling in its basic lines, reveals that
when also liquid flow is taken into account, the aspect ratio of the disc is
not the only geometrical parameter which characterizes the contraction dynamics
of the gel. The analyses we present provide important insights into the
dependence of contraction dynamics on geometry and allow to make some progress
in designing materials which can be adapted for different applications in soft
robotics.

<h3>An atomistic model of electronic polarizability for calculation of Raman  scattering from large-scale MD simulations</h3>

<br>
<br>
The application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to the interpretation
of Raman scattering spectra is hindered by inability of atomistic simulations
to account for the dynamic evolution of electronic polarizability, requiring
the use of either ab initio method or parameterization of machine learning
models. More broadly, the dynamic evolution of electronic-structure-derived
properties cannot be treated by the current atomistic models. Here, we report a
simple, physically-based atomistic model with few (maximum 10 parameters for
the systems considered here) adjustable parameters that can accurately
represent the changes in the electronic polarizability tensor for molecules and
solid-state systems. Due to its compactness, the model can be applied for
simulations of Raman spectra of large (~ 1,000,000-atom) systems with modest
computational cost. To demonstrate its accuracy, the model is applied to the
CO2 molecule, water clusters, and BaTiO3 and CsPbBr3 perovskites and shows good
agreement with ab-initio-derived and experimental polarizability tensor and
Raman data. The atomistic nature of the model enables local analysis of the
contributions to Raman spectra, paving the way for the application of MD
simulations for the interpretation of Raman spectroscopy results. Furthermore,
our successful atomistic representation of the evolution of electronic
polarizability suggests that the evolution of electronic structure and its
derivative properties can be represented by atomistic models, opening up the
possibility of studies of electronic-structure-dependent properties using
large-scale atomistic simulations.

<br>
Lead white is the most ancient and common white pigment used in mural
paintings. However, it tends to blacken with time due to its oxidation to
plattnerite (\b{eta}-PbO2). Chemical treatments were used but they can put the
pictorial layers supports at risks. Hereby we address the possibility of
thermally reconverting black plattnerite to white lead carbonates via a
massicot (\b{eta}-PbO) intermediate, with a view to developing a restoration
procedure using continuous wave laser heating. We first investigated the
conditions (temperature, time, and environment) in which pure powders react,
before studying mural painting samples. Experiments were made in ovens and TGA
and XRD and SEM characterization were achieved. Litharge ({\alpha}-PbO) and
massicot were obtained from plattnerite respectively between 564 and 567
{\deg}C and at 650 {\deg}C. Lead carbonates (cerussite, hydrocerussite and
plumbonacrite) formed from massicot in wet CO2 below 100 {\deg}C in a few
hours. Lastly, when heating plattnerite based mural painting samples, lead
species reacted with binders and mortar, yielding massicot, plumbonacrite but
also lead silicate and calcium lead oxides. This demonstrates the viability of
thermal reconversion of darkened lead in mural, while raising concerns about
the formation of several lead species by reaction with mural painting
constituents.

<h3>Explaining Giant Apparent $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{A}$ Shifts in Weak  Polyelectrolyte Brushes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07544" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07544</a>
<br>
<i>David Beyer, Peter Košovan, Christian Holm</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments on weak polyelectrolyte brushes found marked shifts in the
effective p$K_\mathrm{A}$ that are linear in the logarithm of the salt
concentration. Comparing explicit-particle simulations with mean-field
calculations we show that for high grafting densities the salt concentration
effect can be explained using the ideal Donnan theory, but for low grafting
densities the full shift is due to a combination of the Donnan effect and the
polyelectrolyte effect. The latter originates from electrostatic correlations
which are neglected in the Donnan picture and which are only approximately
included in the mean-field theory. Moreover, we demonstrate that the magnitude
of the polyelectrolyte effect is almost invariant with respect to salt
concentration but depends on the grafting density of the brush. This invariance
is due to a complex cancellation of multiple effects. Based on our results, we
show how the experimentally determined p$K_\mathrm{A}$ shifts may be used to
infer the grafting density of brushes, a parameter that is difficult to measure
directly.

<br>
<br>
Nanostructuration and nanocomposites have shown great potential for improving
the efficiency of thermoelectric materials. By using only physical vapor
deposition techniques, nanocomposites composed of Fe nanoparticles embedded
into a CrN matrix were produced. By using a combinatorial process of high-power
impulse magnetron sputtering and a so-called nanoparticle gun, multilayer
nanocomposite coatings were deposited. The combinatorial technique allowed the
formation of nanocomposites in which the Fe nanoparticles remained intact
without reaction with the matrix. The measured thermoelectric properties of the
coatings revealed an increase in the Seebeck coefficient, with a decrease in
the electrical conductivity after insertion of Fe nanoparticle. This change of
behavior has been correlated to the variation of charge carrier concentration
and electron mobility. This study shows the potential of the synthesis process
used for creating nanocomposites, and of the strategy used for improving the
thermoelectric properties of coatings.

In this study, we evaluate several classifiers and focus on selecting a
minimal set of appropriate material features. Our objective is to propose and
discuss general strategies for reducing the number of descriptors required for
material classification. The first strategy involves testing whether the
critical temperature of the target material property is invariant with respect
to binary groups of composition-based features. We also propose a
multi-objective optimization procedure to reduce the set of composition-based
material descriptors. The latter procedure is found to be particularly useful
when applied to Bayesian classifiers. We test the proposed strategies focusing
on low-temperature superconductors material data extracted from a public

We present electronic structure calculations on layered nickelate
oxyfluorides derived from the Ruddlesden-Popper arisotype structure in search
of unidentified materials that may host nickelate superconductivity. By
performing anion exchange of oxygen with fluorine, we create two heteroanionic
La$_2$NiO$_3$F polymorphs and stabilize Ni$^{1+}$ in 4-coordinate and
5-coordinate square planar and square pyramidal geometries, respectively. We
further predict chemical reactions with high thermodynamic driving forces to
guide their synthesis. These oxyfluorides are weakly correlated
antiferromagnetic insulators and their nonmagnetic phases exhibit quasi-2D
Fermi surfaces dominated by Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, which strikingly resemble
undoped cuprate superconductors. We discuss how the oxyfluoride anion chemistry
promotes Ni-O covalency and single-band character that is more similar to the
cuprates than homoanionic infinite-layer nickelates. We use our understanding
to propose doping strategies and layered LaSrNiO$_2$F$_2$ and
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_4$F$_3$ nickelate oxyfluorides with tunable electronic and

<h3>A Framework for Ductility in Metallic Glasses</h3>

<br>
<br>
The understanding and quantification of ductility in crystalline metals,
which has led to their widespread and effective usage as a structural material,
is lacking in metallic glasses (MGs). Here, we introduce such a framework for
ductility. This very practical framework is based on a MGs ability to support
stable shear band growth, quantified in a stress gradient, gradSDB, which we
measure and calculate for a range of MGs. Whether a MG behaves ductile or
brittle in an application is determined by the comparison between gradsDB the
applied stress field gradient, gradsapp. If gradsDB > gradsapp, the MG will
behave brittle, if gradsDB < gradsapp, the MG will behave ductile, and gradsapp
- gradsDB indicates how ductile. This framework can explain observed plastic
properties of MGs and their apparent contradicting brittle and ductile
characteristics. Looking forward, proposed framework provides the constitutive
relation to quantitatively model their plastic behavior in any application, a
requirement to use MGs as structural materials.

The Menger sponge is a three-dimensional cube that comprises a self-similar,
fractal domain and a non-fractal domain, both of which are continuous. Thus it

We discuss a two-parameter renormalization group (RG) flow when parameters
are organized in a single complex variable, $\tau$, with modular properties.
Throughout the work we consider a special limit when the imaginary part of
$\tau$ characterizing the disorder strength tends to zero. We argue that
generalized Riemann-Thomae (gRT) function and the corresponding generalized
Devil's staircase emerge naturally in a variety of physical models providing a
universal behavior. In 1D we study the Anderson-like probe hopping in a weakly
disordered lattice, recognize the origin of the gRT function in the spectral
density of the probe and formulate specific RG procedure which gets mapped onto
the discrete flow in the fundamental domain of the modular $SL(2,Z)$ group. In
2D we consider the generalization of phyllotaxis crystal model proposed by L.
Levitov and suggest the explicit form of the effective potential for the probe
particle propagating in the symmetric and asymmetric 2D lattice of defects. The
corresponding RG-like dynamics in the fundamental domain of $SL(2,Z)$ for
asymmetric lattices asymptotically approaches various ``metallic ratios''
(among which the ``Silver ratio'' is one of the examples). For a Hubbard model
of particles on a ring interacting with long-ranged potentials we investigate
the dependence of the ground state energy on the potential and demonstrate by
combining numerical and analytical tools the emergence of the generalized
Devil's staircase. Also we conjecture a bridge between a Hubbard model and a
phyllotaxis.

Wilson-Fisher expansion near upper critical dimension has proven to be an
invaluable conceptual and computational tool in our understanding of the
universal critical behavior in the $\phi ^4$ field theories that describe
low-energy physics of the canonical models such as Ising, XY, and Heisenberg.
Here I review its application to a class of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) field
theories, which emerge as possible universal description of a number of quantum
phase transitions in electronic two-dimensional systems such as graphene and
d-wave superconductors. GNY field theories may be viewed as minimal
modifications of the $\phi^4$ field theories in which the order parameter is
coupled to relativistic Dirac fermions through Yukawa term, and which still
exhibit critical fixed points in the suitably formulated Wilson-Fisher
$\epsilon$-expansion. I discuss the unified GNY field theory for a set of
different symmetry-breaking patterns, with focus on the
semimetal-N\'eel-ordered-Mott insulator quantum phase transition in the
half-filled Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, for which a comparison
between the state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-expansion, quantum Monte Carlo,
large-N, and functional renormalization group calculations can be made.

In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive study of the physical
properties of Kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 using the density functional theory
(DFT). The structural, mechanical, electronic, atomic bonding, hardness,
thermodynamic, and optical properties, and their pressure dependences have been
investigated for the first time. The calculated ground state lattice parameters
and volume are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. The
estimated single-crystal elastic constants ensured the mechanical stability of
the compound, whereas phonon spectra endorse dynamical stability at zero
pressure. The electronic band structure, energy density of states, optical
properties confirmed the metallic features. The Pugh ratio, Poisson's ratio of
the compound revealed softness and ductility. The hardness, estimated from
several formulae, is quite low while the machinability index predicted good
machinability with excellent dry lubricating properties. The compound shows
tendency towards structural instability at a pressure around 18 GPa. The
optical constants have also been studied to correlate those with electronic
properties and to predict possible applications of this compound. Both
mechanical and optical properties show anisotropy.CsV3Sb5 is predicted to be an
efficient absorber of ultraviolet radiation. The compound is also an efficient

It has been established empirically that the rate of addition of molecules to
the crystal during crystal growth from the melt is proportional to
exp(-|{\Delta}S_fus|/R) where {\Delta}S_fus is the entropy of fusion. Here we
show that this entropic slowdown arises directly from the separation of the
entropy loss and energy loss processes associated with the freezing of the
liquid. We present a theoretical treatment of the kinetics based on a model
flat energy landscape and derive an explicit expression for the coupling
magnitude in terms of the crystal-melt interfacial free energy. The
implications of our work for nucleation kinetics are also discussed.

<br>
<br>
Electrostatic-elastic coupling in colloidal crystals, composed of a mobile
Coulomb gas permeating a fixed background crystalline lattice of charged
colloids, is studied on the continuum level in order to analyze the
lattice-mediated interactions between mobile charges. The linearized, Debye-H\"
uckel-like mean-field equations allow for an analytic solution incorporating
the minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields leading to
an additional effective attractive interaction between mobile charges. For
small screening lengths, the interactions between mobile like charges exhibit a
coupling-strength-dependent behavior, with lattice mediated effective
interaction ranging from weak to strong attraction, while for large screening
lengths the lattice mediated interaction remains purely attractive. By
analyzing Gaussian fluctuations around the mean-field solution we identify its
region of stability in terms of the electrostatic-elastic screening length. A
detailed continuum theory incorporating the standard lattice elasticity and
electrostatics of mobile charges augmented by the electrostatic-elastic
coupling terms can serve as a baseline for more detailed microscopic models.

<h3>Anderson localization in dissipative lattices</h3>

Anderson localization predicts that wave spreading in disordered lattices can
come to a complete halt, providing a universal mechanism for {dynamical
localization}. In the one-dimensional Hermitian Anderson model with
uncorrelated diagonal disorder, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
dynamical localization and spectral localization, i.e. the exponential
localization of all the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. This correspondence can be
broken when dealing with disordered dissipative lattices. Recently, it has been
shown that when the system exchanges particles with the surrounding environment
and random fluctuations of the dissipation are introduced, spectral
localization is observed but without dynamical localization. Such previous
studies considered lattices with mixed conservative (Hamiltonian) and
dissipative dynamics, and were restricted to a semiclassical analysis. However,
Anderson localization in purely dissipative lattices, displaying an entirely
Lindbladian dynamics, remains largely unexplored. Here we consider the
purely-dissipative Anderson model in the framework of a Lindblad master
equation and show that, akin to the semiclassical models with conservative
hopping and random dissipation, one observes dynamical delocalization in spite
of strong spectral localization of all eigenstates of the Liouvillian
superoperator. This result is very distinct than delocalization observed in the
Anderson model with dephasing effects, where dynamical delocalization arises
from the delocalization of the stationary state of the Liouvillian
superoperator.

<br>
<br>
Anderson localization is ubiquitous in wavy systems with strong static and
uncorrelated disorder. The delicate destructive interference underlying
Anderson localization is usually washed out in the presence of temporal
fluctuations or aperiodic drives in the Hamiltonian, leading to delocalization
and restoring transport. However, in one-dimensional lattices with off-diagonal
disorder Anderson localization can persist for arbitrary time-dependent
drivings that do not break a hidden conservation law originating from the
chiral symmetry, leading to the dubbed 'localization without eigenstates'. Here
it is shown that such an intriguing phenomenon can be observed in discrete-time
photonic quantum walks with static disorder applied to the coin operator, and
can be extended to non-Hermitian dynamics as well.

The Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) model [Science 357, 61 (2017)],

insulators. In this work, we generalize the BBH model to arbitrary dimensions
and demonstrate the bulk multipole moment. In our demonstration, the analytical
solution of corner states can be directly constructed, which possesses a
unified and elegant form. Based on the corner states solution and chiral
symmetries analysis, we develop a general boundary projection method to extract
the boundary Hamiltonians, which thoroughly reveals the boundary-localized
multipole moments of lower dimension, the hallmark of topological multipole
insulators. Our work facilitates the unified understanding of topological

We study the prethermal Floquet phases of a two-dimensional (2D) Rydberg atom
array on a rectangular lattice in the presence of a periodic drive with large
drive amplitude. We derive an analytic, albeit perturbative, Floquet
Hamiltonian using Floquet perturbation theory (FPT) which charts out these
phases and shows that the transition between them can be accessed by tuning the
drive frequency. Using both numerical exact diagonalization on finite-size
arrays and analytical first-order Floquet Hamiltonian derived using FPT, we
show that these prethermal Floquet phases and the transitions between them can
be detected by studying the dynamics of equal-time density-density correlation
functions of the Rydberg atoms. Our analysis thus provides a simple way of
detecting these phases and associated transitions in this system; such a
detection can be achieved in standard experiments which we discuss.

A criterium is derived to understand the relevance of thermal effects
resulting from high rate mechanical actions on glass surface. The criterium is
based on the concept of characteristic contact time of the load to the glass
surface. This criterium is of particular relevance to impact phenomena. A
general discussion about dissipative aspects of indentation on glass surface is
presented and a thermodynamic approach is suggested to evaluate the energetic
of the process. Further generalization is proposed based on the thermodynamics
of continuous media.

Static nonreciprocal forces between particles generically drive persistent
motion reminiscent of self-propulsion. Here, we demonstrate that
reciprocity-breaking fluctuations about a reciprocal mean coupling strength are
sufficient to generate this behavior in a minimal two-particle model, with the
velocity of the ensuing \textit{active} bound state being modulated in time
according to the nature of these fluctuations. To characterize the ensuing
nonequilibrium dynamics, we derive exact results for the time-dependent center
of mass mean-squared displacement and average rate of entropy production for
two simple examples of discrete- and continuous-state fluctuations. We find
that the resulting dimer can exhibit unbiased persistent motion akin to that of
an active particle, leading to a significantly enhanced effective diffusivity.

Topologically protected spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, have the
potential for dense data storage as well as energy-efficient computing due to
their small size and a low driving current. The evaluation of the writing and
reading of the skyrmion's magnetic and electrical characteristics is a key step
toward the implementation of these devices. In this paper, we present the
magnetic heterostructure Hall bar device and study the anomalous Hall and
topological Hall signals in the device. Using the combination of different
measurements like magnetometry at different temperatures, Hall effect
measurement from 2K to 300K, and magnetic force microscopy imaging, we
investigate the magnetic and electrical characteristics of the magnetic
structure. We measure the skyrmion topological resistivity at different
temperatures as a function of the magnetic field. The topological resistivity
is maximum around the zero magnetic field and it decreases to zero at the
saturating field. This is further supported by MFM imaging. Interestingly the
resistivity decreases linearly with the field, matching the behavior observed
in the corresponding micromagnetic simulations. We combine the experimental
results with micromagnetic simulations, thus propose a skyrmion-based synaptic
device and show spin-orbit torque-controlled potentiation/depression in the
device. The device performance as the synapse for neuromorphic computing is
further evaluated in a convolutional neural network CNN. The neural network is
trained and tested on the MNIST data set we show devices acting as synapses
achieving a recognition accuracy close to 90%, on par with the ideal
software-based weights which offer an accuracy of 92%.

<h3>Flux-induced midgap states between strain-engineered flat bands</h3>

Half-integer quantized flux vortices appear in honeycomb lattices when the
signs of an odd number of couplings around a plaquette are inverted. We show
that states trapped at these vortices can be isolated by applying inhomogeneous
strain to the system. A vortex then results in localized mid-gap states lying
between the strain-induced pseudo-Landau levels, with $2n+1$ midgap states
appearing between the $n$th and the $n+1$st level. These states are
well-defined spectrally isolated and spatially localized excitations that could
be realized in electronic and photonic systems based on graphene-like honeycomb
lattices. In the context of Kitaev's honeycomb model of interacting spins, the
mechanism improves the localization of non-Abelian anyons in the spin-liquid
phase, and reduces their mutual interactions. The described states also serve
as a testbed for fundamental physics in the emerging low-energy theory, as the
correct energies and degeneracies of the excitations are only replicated if one
accounts for the effective hyperbolic geometric induced by the strain. We
further illuminate this by considering the effects of an additional external
magnetic field, resulting in a characteristic spatial dependence that directly
maps out the inhomogeneous metric of the emerging hyperbolic space.

<h3>Equilibrium current distributions and W_{infinity} gauge theory in  quantum Hall systems of conventional electrons and Dirac electrons</h3>

<br>
<br>
In equilibrium planer systems of Hall electrons, such as GaAs
heterostructures and graphene, support two species of current counterflowing
along the system edges, as observed recently in experiment using a nanoscale
magnetometer. We examine distinct origins and distinctive features of these
equilibrium currents, with the Coulombic many-body effects taken into account,
and derive their real-space distributions. Our basic tool of analysis is a
reformulation of quantum Hall systems as a W_{infinity} gauge theory, which
allows one to diagonalize the total Hamiltonian according to the resolutions of
external probes. These equilibrium currents are deeply tied to the orbital
magnetization in quantum Hall systems. Special attention is drawn to the case
of graphene, especially the neutral (nu=0) ground state and its intrinsic
diamagnetic response that combines with the equilibrium currents to govern the
orbital magnetization and its oscillations with filling.

<br>
<br>
We study the effect of time-fluctuating social influences on the formation of
polarization and consensus in a three-party community consisting of two types
of voters ("leftists" and "rightists") holding extreme opinions, and moderate
agents acting as "centrists". The former are incompatible and do not interact,
while centrists hold an intermediate opinion and can interact with extreme
voters. When a centrist and a leftist/rightist interact, they can become either
both centrists or both leftists/rightists. The population eventually either
reaches consensus with one of the three opinions, or a polarization state
consisting of a frozen mixture of leftists and rightists. As a main novelty,
here agents interact subject to time-fluctuating external influences favouring
in turn the spread of leftist and rightist opinions, or the rise of centrism.
We determine the fate of the population under various scenarios, and show how
the rate of change of external influences can drastically affect the
polarization and consensus probabilities, as well as the mean time to reach the
final state.

Condensed matter systems with flat bands have been the center of research
interest in recent years as they provide a platform for the emergence of exotic
many-body states, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and the fractional
quantum Hall effect. However, realization of materials possessing at bands near
the Fermi level experimentally is very rare. Here, we report the experimental
observation of flat bands in a weakly-correlated system YRu2Si2 employing
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) which is supported by
first-principles calculations. These flat bands originate from Ru d orbitals
and are found to be sensitive to the polarization of light. In addition, ARPES
data revealed surface and bulk Dirac-like bands. The observed ARPES data is in
excellent agreement with the density functional theory results. The presence of
both flat bands and Dirac-like bands in YRu2Si2 suggest a unique synergy of
correlation and topology in this material belonging to the centrosymmetric
tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure thus establishing a new platform to
investigate flat band physics in combination with non-trivial topological
states in a weakly correlated system.

During the past decades, approximate Kohn-Sham density-functional theory
schemes garnered many successes in computational chemistry and physics; yet the
performance in the prediction of spin state energetics is often unsatisfactory.
By means of a machine-learning approach, an enhanced exchange and correlation
functional is developed to describe adiabatic energy differences in transition
metal complexes. The functional is based on the computationally efficient
revision of the regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed
(R2SCAN) functional and improved by an artificial neural-network correction
trained over a small dataset of electronic densities, atomization energies
and/or spin state energetics. The meta-GGA functional, optimized using a
bio-inspired non gradient-based approach adapted from Particle Swarm
Optimization, is shown to outperform most known density functionals in the
prediction of adiabatic energy differences for both the validation test and the
generality test.

<h3>Exciton Superfluidity in 2D Heterostructures from First Principles: The  importance of material specific screening</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07900</a>

<i>Rune Højlund, Emil Grovn, Sahar Pakdel, Kristian S. Thygesen, Fredrik Nilsson</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest that van der Waals
heterostructures with n- and p-doped bilayers of transition metal
dichalcogenides are promising facilitators of exciton superfluidity. Exciton
superfluidity in such bilayer systems is often modelled by solving a mean-field
gap equation defined for only the conduction and valence band of the electron
and hole material respectively. A key quantity entering the gap equation is the
effective Coulomb potential acting as the bare interaction in the subspace of
the model. Since the model only includes a few bands around the Fermi energy
the effective model interaction is partially screened. Although the screening
is a material dependent quantity it has in previous works been accounted for in
an ad hoc manner, by assuming a static dielectric constant of 2 for a wide
range of different materials. In this work we show that the effective model
interaction can be derived from first principles using open source code
frameworks. Using this novel ab initio downfolding procedure we show that the
material dependent screening is essential to predict both magnitude and trends
of exciton binding energies and superfluid properties. Furthermore, we suggest
new material platforms of both transition metal oxides and dichalcogenides with
superior properties compared to the standard devices with two transition metal
dichalcogenide layers.

<h3>Origin of filaments in finite-time in Newtonian and non-Newtonian  thin-films</h3>

<br>
<br>
The sticky fluids found in pitcher plant leaf vessels can leave fractal-like
filaments behind when dewetting from a substrate. To understand the origin of
these filaments, we investigate the dynamics of a retreating thin-film of
aqueous polyethylene oxide (PEO) solutions which partially wet polydimethyl
siloxane (PDMS) substrates. Under certain conditions the retreating film
generates regularly-spaced liquid filaments. The early-stage thin-film dynamics
of dewetting are investigated to identify a theoretical criterion for liquid
filament formation. Starting with a linear stability analysis of a Newtonian or
simple non-Newtonian (power-law) thin-film, a critical film thickness is
identified which depends on the Hamaker constant for the fluid-substrate pair
and the surface tension of the fluid. When the measured film thickness is
smaller than this value, the film is unstable and forms filaments as a result
of van der Waals forces dominating its behaviour. This critical film-height is
compared with experimental measurements of film thickness obtained for receding
films of Newtonian (glycerol-water mixtures) and non-Newtonian (PEO) solutions
generated on substrates inclined at angles 0 $^{\circ}$, 30 $^{\circ}$, and 60
$^{\circ}$ to the vertical. The observations of filament and its absence show
good agreement with the theory. The evolution of the thin-film shape is
modelled numerically to show that the formation of filaments arises because the
thin-film equation features a singular solution after a finite-time, hence
termed a "finite-time singularity".

Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ are centrosymmetric systems that have recently been
identified as candidates to stabilise topologically non-trivial magnetic
phases, such as skyrmion lattices. In this Letter, we present a high-resolution
resonant x-ray and neutron scattering study on EuGa2Al2 that provides new
details of the complex coupling between the electronic ordering phenomena. Our
results unambiguously demonstrate that the system orders to form a spin density
wave with moments aligned perpendicular to the direction of the propagation
vector, and upon further cooling, a cycloid with moments in the ab plane, in
contrast to what has been reported in the literature. We show that concomitant
with the onset of the spin density wave is the suppression of the charge order,
indicative of a coupling between the localised 4$f$ electrons and itinerant
electron density. Furthermore we demonstrate that the charge density wave order
breaks the four-fold symmetry present in the I4/mmm crystal structure, thus
declassifying these systems as square-net magnets.

<h3>Dynamics characterization of the glass formation of twist-bend liquid  crystal dimers through dielectric studies</h3>

Broadband dielectric spectroscopy was used to study the molecular
orientational dynamics of the glass-forming, thioether-linked cyanobiphenyl
liquid crystal dimers. As was expected theoretically, two different relaxation
processes that contributed to the dielectric permittivity of dimers were
observed. The low-frequency relaxation mode, m1, was attributed to an
end-over-end rotation of the dipolar groups parallel to the director. The
high-frequency relaxation mode, m2, was associated with the precessional
motions of the dipolar groups around the director. The relaxation times for
both modes were analyzed over a wide temperature range down to near the glass
transition temperature. The different analytic functions used to characterize
the temperature dependence of the relaxation times of the two modes are
discussed. Notably, the critical-like description via the dynamic scaling model
gave good numerical fittings and a consistent physical picture of the
orientational dynamics on approaching the glass transition. Compared to the IR
spectroscopy finding, in the higher temperature region of the twist-bend phase,
where the longitudinal correlations of dipoles grew, the m1 mode experienced a
sudden increase in enthalpy. At the same time, m2 changed continuously, which
is described by the critical mode coupling behavior. Both types of molecular
motion appear to strongly cooperate at a low-temperature range of the
twist-bend phase but change in a coordinated manner as the temperature of the
material approaches the glass transition point. As was expected, it was found
that both molecular motions determined the glass dynamics at the same glass
transition temperature.

<br>
<br>
We report on the preparation of a pure ultracold sample of bosonic DyK
Feshbach molecules, which are composed of the fermionic isotopes 161Dy and 40K.
Employing a magnetic sweep across a resonance located near 7.3 G, we produce up
to 5000 molecules at a temperature of about 50 nK. For purification from the
remaining atoms, we apply a Stern-Gerlach technique based on magnetic
levitation of the molecules in a very weak optical dipole trap. With the
trapped molecules we finally reach a high phase-space density of about 0.1. We
measure the magnetic field dependence of the molecular binding energy and the
magnetic moment, refining our knowledge of the resonance parameters. We also
demonstrate a peculiar anisotropic expansion effect observed when the molecules
are released from the trap and expand freely in the magnetic levitation field.
Moreover, we identify an important lifetime limitation that is imposed by the
1064-nm infrared trap light itself and not by inelastic collisions. The
light-induced decay rate is found to be proportional to the trap light
intensity and the closed-channel fraction of the Feshbach molecule. These
observations suggest a one-photon coupling to electronically excited states to
limit the lifetime and point to the prospect of loss suppression by optimizing
the wavelength of the trapping light. Our results represent important insights
and experimental steps on the way to achieve quantum-degenerate samples of DyK
molecules and novel superfluids based on mass-imbalanced fermion mixtures.

We investigated the relaxation and excitation in a frustrated XY model
realized by a Bose gas in Floquet-engineered optical triangular lattices.
Periodically driving the position of the entire lattice structure enables the
sign inversion of tunneling amplitudes, which, in the case of a triangular
lattice, results in geometrical frustration of the local phase of wave packets.
We revealed that the two spiral phases (Spiral~1 and Spiral~2) with chiral
modes show significant differences in relaxation time from the initial
ferromagnetic phase. While spontaneous symmetry breaking is clearly observed in
Spiral~1, Spiral~2 often exhibits simultaneous occupation of two ground states,
which can be attributed to the domain formation of the chiral modes. The
interference of the spatially separated phases was observed, using a quantum
gas microscope. This work leads to exploring the domain formation mechanism in
a system with U(1)$\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.

<br>
We combine nanosecond laser shock compression with in-situ picosecond X-ray
diffraction to provide structural data on iron up to 275 GPa. We constrain the
extent of hcp-liquid coexistence, the onset of total melt, and the structure
within the liquid phase. Our results indicate that iron, under shock
compression, melts completely by 258(8) GPa. A coordination number analysis
indicates that iron is a simple liquid at these pressure-temperature
conditions. We also perform texture analysis between the ambient
body-centered-cubic (bcc) $\alpha$, and the hexagonal-closed-packed (hcp)
high-pressure $\epsilon-$phase. We rule out the Rong-Dunlop orientation
relationship (OR) between the $\alpha$ and $\epsilon-$phases. However, we
cannot distinguish between three other closely related ORs: Burger's,
Mao-Bassett-Takahashi, and Potter's OR. The solid-liquid coexistence region is
constrained from a melt onset pressure of 225(3) GPa from previously published
sound speed measurements and full melt (246.5(1.8)-258(8) GPa) from X-ray
diffraction measurements, with an associated latent heat of melting of 362(56)
- 542(83) J/g. This value is lower than recently reported theoretical estimates
and suggests that the contribution to the earth's geodynamo energy budget from
heat release due to freezing of the inner core is smaller than previously
thought. Melt pressures for these nanosecond shock experiments are consistent
with shock experiments that last for microseconds, indicating that the melt
transition occurs rapidly.

A true understanding of the properties of pnictide superconductors require
the development of high-quality materials and performing measurements designed
to unravel their intrinsic properties and short-range nematic correlations
which are often obscured by extrinsic effects such as poor crystallinity,
inhomogeneity, domain formation and twinning. In this paper, we report the
systematic growth of high-quality Na-substituted BaFe2As2 single crystals and
their characterization using pulsed-magnetic fields x-ray diffraction and x-ray
diffuse scattering. Analysis of the properties and compositions of the highest
quality crystals show that their actual Na stoichiometry is about 50-60% of the
nominal content and that the targeted production of crystals with specific
compositions is accessible. We derived a reliable equation to estimate the Na
stoichiometry based on the measured superconducting TC of these materials.
Attempting to force spin reorientation and induce tetragonality, orthorhombic
Ba1-xNaxFe2As2 single crystals subjected to out-of-plane magnetic fields up to
31.4T are found to exhibit strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy demonstrated by
the insufficiency of such high fields in manipulating the relative population
of their twinned domains or in suppressing the orthorhombic order. Broad x-ray
diffuse intensity rods observed at temperatures between 30 K and 300 K uncover
short-range structural correlations. Local structure modeling together with
3D-{\Delta}PDF mapping of real-space interatomic vectors show that the diffuse
scattering arises from in-plane short-range chemical correlations of the Ba and
Na atoms coupled with short-range atomic displacements within the same plane
due to an effective size difference between the two atomic species.

With the recent report of near ambient superconductivity at room temperature
in the N-doped lutetium hydride (Lu-H-N) system, the understanding of cubic
Lu-H compounds has attracted worldwide attention. Generally, compared to
polycrystal structures with non-negligible impurities, the single-crystalline
form of materials with high purity can provide an opportunity to show their
hidden properties. However, the experimental synthesis of single-crystalline
cubic Lu-H compounds has not been reported thus far. Here, we developed an easy
way to synthesize highly pure LuH$_{2+x}$ single-crystalline films by the
post-annealing of Lu single-crystalline films (purity of 99.99%) in the H$_2$
atmosphere. The crystal and electronic structures of films were characterized
by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport.
Interestingly, Lu films are silver-white and metallic, whereas their
transformed LuH$_{2+x}$ films become purple-red and insulating, indicating the
formation of an unreported electronic state of Lu-H compounds possibly. Our
work provides a novel route to synthesize and explore more single-crystalline
Lu-H compounds.

We utilize the self-consistent field theory to explore the mechanical and
electrical properties of charged surfaces immersed in polyelectrolyte solutions
that could be potentially useful for electrochemical applications. Our research
focuses on how the dielectric heterogeneity of the solution could affect the
disjoining pressure and differential capacitance of the electric double layer.
Relying on the developed theoretical framework, based on the Noether's theorem,
we calculate the stress tensor, containing the term, arising from the
conformational entropy of the polymer chains. With its help we compute the
disjoining pressure in polyelectrolyte solution confined between two parallel
charged surfaces and analyze its behavior as a function of separation between
the surfaces for different values of dielectric mismatch parameter. We also
calculate the differential capacitance of the electric double layer and discuss
how dielectric heterogeneity of the polyelectrolyte solution influences its
values.

Rational control over the periodic arrangement of particles by means of
external stimuli is a technologically important aspect of colloidal science
with important physical underpinnings. Here, a robust structural control of
particle assemblies in a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) is demonstrated by
dissolving trace amounts of light-responsive azo-dendrimer molecules which
spontaneously get adsorbed on the particle surface. The azo-dendrimer molecules
in the presence of external UV irradiation undergo conformational change
(trans-cis); as a result, they transmit the mechanical torque to surrounding LC
molecules and alter the near-field director orientation. The director
re-orientation at the surface of the particles causes topological defect
transformation which involves elastic dipoles, quadrupoles and hexadecapoles.
The defect transformation can be emulated in colloidal assemblies towards
different purposes such as rotation of chains and restructuring of 2D colloidal
crystals. In this study, various topological aspects of light-activated defect
transformation and its application in the collective manipulation of colloidal
assemblies are presented.

Recent works on coupling of two simple heat engines have shown that it may
lead to non-monotonic variations in the efficiency and power with parameters
like driving amplitudes and asymmetries in cycle periods. Motivated by this
study, we investigate the effect of the coupling between two stochastic heat
engines where colloidal particles have been trapped in harmonic potentials. The
stiffness parameters of each engine are varied cyclically, but with different
cycle periods, with a common thermal bath that acts as a sink for the first
engine but as a source for the second. We consider two types of protocols,
first where trap strength is varied linearly and the second that has sudden
jumps in the trap strengths. In both we find several non-trivial effects, like
the enhanced performance of the coupled engine with respect to a single
effective engine, and the non-monotonic functional dependence of the engine
outputs on several parameters used in the setup. A general relation of the
efficiency of an arbitrary number of coupled engines driven quasistatically has
been provided.

The achieved interface width in multilayers is crucial for the performance of

The flow of electric current through a two-dimensional material in a magnetic
field gives rise to the family of Hall effects. The quantum versions of these
effects accommodate robust electronic edge channels and fractional charges.
Recently, the Hall effect of skyrmions, classical magnetic quasiparticles with
a quantized topological charge, has been theoretically and experimentally
reported, igniting ideas on a quantum version of this effect. To this end, we
perform dynamical mean field theory calculations on localized $f$ electrons
coupled to itinerant $c$ electrons in the presence of spin-orbit interaction
and a magnetic field. Our calculations reveal localized nano quantum skyrmions
that start moving transversally when a charge current in the itinerant
electrons is applied. The results show the time-transient build-up of the
quantum skyrmion Hall effect, accompanied by an Edelstein effect and a
magnetoelectric effect that rotate the spins. This work motivates studies about
the steady state of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, looking for eventual
quantum skyrmion edge channels and their transport properties.

<br>
Complexity of quantum phases of matter is often understood by the underlying
gauge structures, as was recognized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and U(1) gauge theory
description of spin liquid in frustrated magnets. Anomalous Hall effect of
conducting electrons can intrisically arise from U(1) gauges expressing the
spatial modulation of ferromagnetic moments or from SU(2) gauges representing
the spin-orbit coupling effect. Similarly, in insulating ferro and
antiferromagnets, the magnon excitations can contribute to anomalous transports
by feeling the U(1) and SU(2) gauges arising from the features of ordered
moments or interactions. In this work, we report the emergent higher rank SU(3)
gauge structure in the magnon transport based on the thermal conductivity
measurements of MnSc$_2$S$_4$ in an applied field up to 14\,T. The thermal Hall
coefficient takes a substantial value when the material enters a
three-sublattice antiferromagnetic skyrmion phase, which is confirmed by the
large-scale spin wave theory. The excited magnons are dressed with SU(3) gauge
field, which is a mixture of three species of U(1) gauge fields originating
from the slowly varying magnetic moments on these sublattices.

<h3>Grassmann phase space dynamics of strongly-correlated fermion</h3>

<i>Hassan Al-Hamzawi, Alessandro Principi, Leone Di Mauro Villari</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss the numerical implementation of two related representations of
fermionic density matrices which have been introduced in Annals of Physics 370,
12 (2016). In both of them, the density matrix is expanded in a basis of
Bargmann coherent states with weights given by the two phase space
distributions. We derive the equations of motion for the distributions when
imaginary time evolution is generated by the Hubbard Hamiltonian. One of them
is a Grassmann Fokker-Planck equation that can be re-cast into a remarkably
simple It\^{o} form involving solely complex variables. In spite of this simple
form, we demonstrate that complications arise in numerically computing the
expectation value of any observable. These are due to exponential growth in the
matrix elements of the stochastic propagator, delicate numerical sensitivity in
performing primitive linear algebra operations, and the re-appearance of a sign
problem.

<h3>Geometric phase and a nonreciprocal spin wave circular polarizer</h3>

<br>
<i>Yu Liu, Jin Lan</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that spin wave acquires a polarization-dependent geometric phase
along a cyclic trajectory of non-coplanar magnetizations in antiferromagnets.
Specifically, we demonstrate that a cyclic set of 90 degree antiferromagnetic
domain walls simultaneously introduce geometric and dynamic phases to spin
wave, and thus leads to asymmetric magnitude of overall phase for
left-/right-circular components. Based on the polarization-dependent phase, we
propose theoretically and confirm by micromagnetic simulations that, a
Mach-Zehner interferometer with cyclic 90 degree domain walls in one arm and
homogenous domain in the other arm, naturally acts as a spin wave circular
polarizer. Moreover, the circular polarizer has intrinsic nonreciprocity, which
filters opposite polarization in opposite propagation direction.

<h3>Ultrafast Relaxation Dynamics of Spin-Density Wave Order in  BaFe$_2$As$_2$ under High Pressures</h3>

<br>
<br>
BaFe$_2$As$_2$ is the parent compound for a family of iron-based
high-temperature superconductors as well as a prototypical example of the
spin-density wave (SDW) system. In this study, we perform an optical pump-probe
study of this compound to systematically investigate the SDW order across the
pressure-temperature phase diagram. The suppression of the SDW order by
pressure manifests itself by the increase of relaxation time together with the
decrease of the pump-probe signal and the pump energy necessary for complete
vaporization of the SDW condensate. We have found that the pressure-driven
suppression of the SDW order at low temperature occurs gradually in contrast to
the thermally-induced SDW transition. Our results suggest that the
pressure-driven quantum phase transition in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ (and probably other
iron pnictides) is continuous and it is caused by the gradual worsening of the
Fermi-surface nesting conditions.

<h3>Thermal signature of helical molecule: Beyond nearest-neighbor electron  hopping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08081</a>
<br>
<i>Suparna Sarkar, Santanu K. Maiti, David Laroze</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate, for the first time, the thermal signature of a
single-stranded helical molecule, subjected to a transverse electric field, by
analyzing electronic specific heat (ESH). Depending on the hopping of
electrons, two different kinds of helical systems are considered. In one case
the hopping is confined within a few neighboring lattice sites which is
referred to as short-range hopping (SRH) helix, while in the other case,
electrons can hop in all possible sites making the system a long-range hopping
(LRH) one. The interplay between helicity and the electric field is quite
significant. Our detailed study shows that, in the low-temperature limit, the
SRH helix is more sensitive to temperature than its counterpart. Whereas, the
situation gets reversed in the limit of high temperatures. The thermal response
of the helix can be modified selectively by means of the electric field, and
the difference between specific heats of the two helices gradually decreases
with increasing the field strength. The molecular handedness (viz, left-handed
or right-handed) rather has no appreciable effect on the thermal signature.
Finally, one important usefulness of ESH is discussed. If the helix contains a
point defect, then by comparing the results of perfect and defective helices,
one can estimate the location of the defect, which might be useful in
diagnosing bad cells and different diseases.

<h3>Non-sinusoidal current-phase relation controlled by spin-orbit coupling</h3>

<br>
<i>Shu-Ichiro Suzuki, Yasuhiro Asano, Alexander A. Golubov</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically show the origin of the non-sinusoidal current phase relation
(CPR). The Josephson current in the ZS/N/ZS junctions changes suddenly its
direction at a certain phase difference (i.e., critical phase difference
$\phi_c$), where ZS and N stand for the Zeeman-splitting superconductor and the
normal metal. As a consequence, their CPRs become non-sinusoidal. Calculating
the spectral Josephson current, the band-splitting by the Zeeman interaction
plays an important role in reversing the current and determines $\phi_c$. We
also propose a method to control non-sinusoidal CPR. The critical phase in the
non-sinusoidal CPR can be controlled by tuning the Rashba spin-orbit
interaction instead of by manipulating the magnetizations.

<h3>Universal platform of point-gap topological phases from topological  materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Daichi Nakamura, Kazuya Inaka, Nobuyuki Okuma, Masatoshi Sato</i>
<br>
<br>
Whereas point-gap topological phases are responsible for exceptional
phenomena intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, their realization in quantum
materials is still elusive. Here we propose a simple and universal platform of
point-gap topological phases constructed from Hermitian topological insulators
and superconductors. We show that (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological
phases are realized by making a boundary in d-dimensional topological
insulators and superconductors dissipative. A crucial observation of the
proposal is that adding a decay constant to boundary modes in d-dimensional
topological insulators and superconductors is topologically equivalent to
attaching a (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phase to the boundary. We
furthermore establish the proposal from the extended version of the
Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, relating dissipative gapless modes to point-gap
topological numbers. From the bulk-boundary correspondence of the point-gap
topological phases, the resultant point-gap topological phases exhibit
exceptional boundary states or in-gap higher-order non-Hermitian skin effects.

<br>
<br>
One-dimensional (1D) topological superconductivity is a state of matter that
is not found in nature. However, it can be realised, for example, by inducing
superconductivity into the quantum spin Hall edge state of a two-dimensional
topological insulator. Because topological superconductors are proposed to host
Majorana zero modes, they have been suggested as a platform for topological
quantum computing. Yet, conclusive proof of 1D topological superconductivity
has remained elusive. Here, we employ low-temperature scanning tunnelling
microscopy to show 1D topological superconductivity in a van der Waals
heterostructure by directly probing its superconducting properties, instead of
relying on the observation of Majorana zero modes at its boundary. We realise
this by placing the two-dimensional topological insulator monolayer WTe$_2$ on
the superconductor NbSe$_2$. We find that the superconducting topological edge
state is robust against magnetic fields, a hallmark of its triplet pairing. Its
topological protection is underpinned by a lateral self-proximity effect, which
is resilient against disorder in the monolayer edge. By creating this exotic
state in a van der Waals heterostructure, we provide an adaptable platform for
the future realization of Majorana bound states. Finally, our results more
generally demonstrate the power of Abrikosov vortices as effective experimental
probes for superconductivity in nanostructures.

<h3>Effects of first- and second-order topological phases on the equilibrium  crystal shapes</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study equilibrium crystal shapes of a topological insulator (TI), a
topological crystalline insulator (TCI) protected by mirror symmetry, and a
second-order topological insulator (SOTI) protected by inversion symmetry. By
adding magnetic fields to the three-dimensional TI, we can realize the
mirror-symmetry-protected TCI and the inversion-symmetry-protected SOTI. They
each have topological boundary states in different positions: the TCI has
gapless states on the surfaces that are invariant under the symmetry operation,
and the SOTI has gapless states at the intersections between certain surfaces.
In this paper, we discuss how these boundary states affect the surface energies
and the equilibrium crystal shapes in terms of the calculations of the simple
tight-binding model by using the Wulff construction. By comparing the changes
in the shapes of the TI to that of the trivial insulator through the process of
applying the magnetic fields, we show that the presence/absence of the
topological boundary states affects the emergence of the specific facets in a
different way from the trivial insulator.

<h3>Polarization State Conversion through Chiral Butterfly Meta-Structure</h3>

The recent emergence of chirality in mechanical metamaterials has
revolutionized the field, enabling achievements in wave propagation and
polarization control. Despite being an intrinsic feature of some molecules and
ubiquitous in our surroundings, the incorporation of chirality into mechanical
systems has only gained widespread recognition in the last few years. The extra
degrees of freedom induced by chirality has propelled the study of systems to
new heights, leading to a better understanding of the physical laws governing
these systems. In this study, we present a structural design of a butterfly
meta-structure that exploits the chiral effect to create a 3D chiral butterfly
capable of inducing a rotation of 90{\deg} in the plane of polarization,
enabling a switch between various polarization states within a solid material.
Furthermore, our numerical investigation using Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
has revealed an unexpected conversion of compressional movement to transverse
movement within these structures, further highlighting the transformative
potential of chirality in mechanical metamaterials. Thus, revealing an
additional degree of freedom that can be manipulated, namely the polarization
state.

<br>
Topological phases based on tight-binding models have been extensively
studied in recent decades. By mimicking the linear combination of atomic
orbitals in tight-binding models based on the evanescent couplings between
resonators in classical waves, numerous experimental demonstrations of
topological phases have been successfully conducted. However, in dielectric
photonic crystals, the Mie resonances' states decay too slowly as $1/r$ when
$r$ $\to$ $\infty$, leading to intrinsically different physical properties
between tight-binding models and dielectric photonic crystals. Here, we propose
a confined Mie resonance photonic crystal by embedding perfect electric
conductors in between dielectric rods, leading to a perfectly matched band
structure as the tight-binding models with nearest-neighbour couplings. As a
consequence, disentangled band structure spanned by higher atomic orbitals is
observed. Moreover, we also achieve a three-dimensional photonic crystal with a
complete photonic bandgap and third-order topology based on our design. Our
implementation provides a versatile platform for studying exotic higher-orbital
bands and achieving tight-binding-like 3D topological photonic crystals.

<h3>Unified role of Green's function poles and zeros in topological  insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
Green's function zeros, which can emerge only if correlation is strong, have
been for long overlooked and believed to be devoid of any physical meaning,
unlike Green's function poles. Here, we prove that Green's function zeros
instead contribute on the same footing as poles to determine the topological
character of an insulator. The key to the proof, worked out explicitly in 2D
but easily extendable in 3D, is to express the topological invariant in terms
of a \textit{quasiparticle} thermal Green's function matrix
$G_*(i\epsilon,\mathbf{k})= 1/\big(i\epsilon-H_*(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})\big)$,
with hermitian $H_*(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})$, by filtering out the positive
definite \textit{quasiparticle} residue. In that way, the topological invariant
is easily found to reduce to the TKNN formula for quasiparticles described by
the non-interacting Hamiltonian $H_*(0,\mathbf{k})$. Since the poles of the
quasiparticle Green's function $G_*(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})$ on the real frequency
axis correspond to poles and zeros of the physical-particle Green's function
$G(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})$, both of them equally determine the topological
character of an insulator.

<br>

Nonequilibrium thermal machines under cyclic driving generally outperform
steady-state counterparts. However, there is always lack of coherent
understanding of versatile transport and fluctuation features under time
modulations. Here, we formulate a theoretical framework of thermodynamic
geometry in terms of full counting statistics of nonequilibrium driven
transports. We find that, beside the conventional dynamic and adiabatic
geometric curvature contributions, the generating function is divided into an
additional non-adiabatic contribution, manifested as the metric term of full
counting statistics. This nonadiabatic metric generalizes recent results of
thermodynamic geometry in near-equilibrium entropy production to
far-from-equilibrium fluctuations of general currents. Furthermore, the
framework proves a geometric thermodynamic uncertainty relation of
nonadiabatically driven thermal devices, constraining fluctuations in terms of
statistical metric quantities. We exemplify the theory in an experimentally
accessible Brownian heat pump and a driving-induced chiral quantum transport
system.

<i>Ken-ichi Amano, Takumi Otake</i>
<br>
<br>
In this letter, we present anti-cancer drug delivery strategies using
knowledges obtained from our recent studies. We have conducted inverse analyses
of "density distributions of colloidal particles near a focused surface" and
"pair potentials between the surface and the colloidal particle" using data
measured by optical tweezers (OT) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Non-additive Asakura-Oosawa (NAO) theory and a lattice theory in statistical
mechanics of simple polymers have been also our research topics. Summarizing
the knowledges, we propose two strategies to increase the delivery rate of
capsule shaped anti-cancer drugs to cancer cells. We consider that enhanced
repulsion between the normal cell and the drug accelerates the attraction
between the cancer cell and the drug, which can be named enhanced repulsion and
accelerated adsorption (ERAA) effect. To realize the ERAA effect, we propose a
supporting method for measuring the interactions using OT and AFM. In the
second strategy, dose of water-soluble polymers is considered to realize
adsorptions of the drugs and cancer cell derived exosomes onto the cancer
cells, which we call non-specific and selective adsorption (NSSA) effect. In
the main text, we explain the NSSA effect using the NAO theory. Moreover, we
explain that structural stabilities of normal dispersed proteins around the
cancer cells are not largely destroyed by the dosed polymers from the viewpoint
of the lattice theory.

developed. It is demonstrated that a combination of spin electromotive force
measurements and photoluminescence detection provides a powerful tool for
studying the properties of such hybrid structures and allows to resolve the

<h3>Competing charge-density wave instabilities in the kagome metal  ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</h3>

<br>
<i>Saizheng Cao, Chenchao Xu, Hiroshi Fukui, Taishun Manjo, Ming Shi, Yang Liu, Chao Cao, Yu Song</i>
<br>
<br>
Owing to its unique geometry, the kagome lattice hosts various many-body
quantum states including frustrated magnetism, superconductivity, and
charge-density waves (CDWs), with intense efforts focused on kagome metals
exhibiting $2\times2$ CDWs associated with the nesting of van Hove saddle
points. Recently, a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ CDW was discovered in the kagome
metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ below $T_{\rm CDW}\approx91$~K, whose underlying mechanism
and formation process remain unclear. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we
discover a short-range $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times2$ CDW that is dominant in
ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ well above $T_{\rm CDW}$, distinct from the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ CDW below $T_{\rm CDW}$. The short-range CDW
grows upon cooling, and is accompanied by the softening of phonons, indicative
of its dynamic nature. As the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ CDW appears, the
short-range CDW becomes suppressed, revealing a competition between these CDW
instabilities. Our first-principles calculations indicate that the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times2$ CDW is energetically favored, consistent with
experimental observations at high temperatures. However, the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ CDW is selected as the ground state likely due
to a large wavevector-dependent electron-phonon coupling, which also accounts
for the enhanced electron scattering above $T_{\rm CDW}$. The competing CDW
instabilities in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ lead to an unusual CDW formation process, with
the most pronounced phonon softening and the static CDW occurring at different
wavevectors.

<br>
<i>Ryo Makuta, Chisa Hotta</i>
<br>
<br>
When the material phases exhibit topological quantum numbers, they host
defects protected by the nontrivial topology. Magnetic skyrmions are such
``quantized" objects and although many of them are metals they had been most
likely treated in theories as purely classical spin states. Here, we show that
the electrons described by the Hubbard model with strong spin-orbit couplings
can exhibit various nano- or flake-size skyrmions in their ground state.
Importantly, the conducting electrons forming Fermi pockets themselves carry
textured magnetic moments in both real and momentum space and on that top,
possess Chern numbers in their energy bands. This quantum and conducting
skyrmion is related to small skyrmions observed in atomic-layered compounds. We
clarify how the effective magnetic interactions and magnetic anisotropies are
tied to the spin-orbit coupling, and how they influence the stability of
skyrmions beyond the phenomenology.

We develop a theory that accurately evaluates quantum phases with any
large-scale emergent structures including incommensurate density waves or
topological textures without {\it a priori} knowing their periodicity. We
spatially deform a real-space mean-field Hamiltonian on a finite-size cluster
using a sine-squared envelope function with zero energy at system edges. The
wave functions become insensitive to the misfit of the lattice and ordering
periods. We successfully extract the ordering wave vectors by our deformed
Fourier transformation, updating the previous results for hole-doped and
spin-orbit coupled Mott insulators. The method further enables the evaluation
of a charge gap beyond the mean-field level.

Despite its unrivaled hardness, diamond can be severely worn during the
interaction with others, even softer materials. In this work, we calculate from
first-principles the energy and forces necessary to induce the atomistic wear
of diamond, and compare them for different surface orientations and passivation
by oxygen, hydrogen, and water fragments. The primary mechanism of wear is
identified as the detachment of carbon chains. This is particularly true for
oxidized diamond and diamond interacting with silica. A very interesting result
concerns the role of stress, which reveals that compressive stresses can highly
favor wear, making it even energetically favorable.

<br>
<br>
We study the motion of a heavy impurity in a one-dimensional Bose gas. The
impurity experiences the friction force due to scattering off thermally excited
quasiparticles. We present detailed analysis of an arbitrarily strong
impurity-boson coupling in a wide range of temperatures within a microscopic
theory. Focusing mostly on weakly interacting bosons, we derive an analytical
result for the friction force and uncover new regimes of the impurity dynamics.
Particularly interesting is the low-temperature $T^2$ dependence of the
friction force obtained for a strongly coupled impurity, which should be
contrasted with the expected $T^4$ scaling. This new regime applies to systems
of bosons with an arbitrary repulsion strength. We finally study the evolution
of the impurity with a given initial momentum. We evaluate analytically its
non-stationary momentum distribution function. The impurity relaxation towards
the equilibrium is a realization of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in momentum
space.

<br>
<br>
We use inelastic neutron scattering to study spin fluctuations in
Sr$_{1.8}$La$_{0.2}$RuO$_4$, where Lanthanum doping triggers a Lifshitz
transition by pushing the van Hove singularity in the $\gamma$ band to the
Fermi energy. Strong spin fluctuations emerge at an incommensurate wave vector
$\mathbf{Q}_{ic} = (0.3,0.3)$, corresponding to the nesting vector between
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fermi sheets. The incommensurate antiferromagnetic
fluctuations shift toward $(0.25,0.25)$ with increasing energy up to
${\sim}110$ meV. By contrast, scatterings near the ferromagnetic wave vectors
$\mathbf{Q} = (1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ remain featureless at all energies. This
contradicts the weak-coupling perspective that suggests a sharp enhancement of
ferromagnetic susceptibility due to the divergence of density of states in the
associated $\gamma$ band. Our findings imply that ferromagnetic fluctuations in
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and related materials do not fit into the weak-coupling paradigm,
but instead are quasi-local fluctuations induced by Hund's coupling. This
imposes significant constraints for the pairing mechanism involving spin
fluctuations.

We investigate the dynamical properties of quasiparticles in graphene
superlattices with three typical Kekul\'{e} distortions (i.e., Kekul\'{e}-O,
Kekul\'{e}-Y and Kekul\'{e}-M). On the one hand, we numerically show the
visualized evolution process of Kekul\'{e} quasiparticles; while on the other
hand, we analytically obtain the centroid trajectory of the quasiparticles, and
both of them agree well with each other. The results reveal that the
relativistic Zitterbewegung (ZB) phenomenon occurs in the Kekul\'{e} systems.
Furthermore, through analyzing the frequency of ZB, we unveil the one-to-one
relationship between ZB and Kekul\'{e} textures, i.e., the ZB frequenies of
Kekul\'{e}-O, Kekul\'{e}-Y and Kekul\'{e}-M quasiparticles feature single,
double and six frequencies, respectively. Finally, we propose a scheme to
distinguish among different Kekul\'{e} textures from the dynamical perspective.
The predictions in this paper are expected to be experimentally verified in the
near future, so as to facilitate further research of Kekul\'{e} structures in
solid materials or artificial systems.

Pinning at local defects is a significant road block for the successful
implementation of technological paradigms which rely on the dynamic properties
of non-trivial magnetic textures. In this report a comprehensive study of the
influence of local pinning sites for non-homogeneous magnetic layers integrated
as the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction is presented, both
experimentally and with corresponding micromagnetic simulations. The pinning
sites are found to be extremely detrimental to the frequency controllability of
the devices, a key requirement for their use as synapses in a frequency
multiplexed artificial neural networks. In addition to describing the impact of
the local pinning sites in the more conventional NiFe, a vortex-based magnetic
tunnel junction with an amorphous free layer is presented which shows
significantly improved frequency selectivity, marking a clear direction for the
design of future low power devices.

Calculations in Kohn-Sham density functional theory crucially rely on
high-quality approximations for the exchange-correlation (xc) functional.
Standard local and semi-local approximations fail to predict the ionization
potential (IP) and the fundamental gap, departing from the Kohn-Sham orbital
energies, due to the deviation of the total energy from piecewise-linearity and
the absence of the derivative discontinuity. The ensemble generalization
procedure introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 126403 (2013) restores, to a
large extent, these features in any approximate xc functional and improves its
ability to predict the IP and the fundamental gap with negligible additional
computational effort. In this work we perform an extensive study of atoms and
first ions across the Periodic Table, generalizing the local spin-density and
the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof approximations. By applying the ensemble
generalization to a variety of systems, with s-, p- and d-character, we assess
the accuracy of the method and identify important trends. In particular, we
find that the accuracy of our approach heavily depends on the character of the
frontier orbitals: when d-orbitals are involved, the performance is far less
accurate. Possible sources of error are discussed and ways for further
improvement are outlined.

In this paper, we present an extended dissipaton equation of motion for
studying the dynamics of electronic impurity systems. Compared with the
original theoretical formalism, the quadratic couplings are introduced into the
Hamiltonian accounting for the interaction between the impurity and its
surrounding environment. By exploiting the quadratic dissipaton algebra, the
proposed extended dissipaton equation of motion offers a powerful tool for
studying the dynamical behaviors of electronic impurity systems, particularly
in situations where nonequilibrium and strongly correlated effects play
significant roles. Numerical demonstrations are carried out to investigate the
temperature dependence of the Kondo resonance in the Kondo impurity model.

The phase diagram of a system with two order parameters, with ${\it n_1}$ and
$n_2$ components, respectively, contains two phases, in which these order
parameters are non-zero. Experimentally and numerically, these phases are often
separated by a first-order "flop" line, which ends at a bicritical point. For
$n=n_1+n_2=3$ and $d=3$ dimensions (relevant e.g. to the uniaxial
antiferromagnet in a uniform magnetic field), this bicritical point is found to
exhibit a crossover from the isotropic $n$-component universal critical
behavior to a fluctuation-driven first-order transition, asymptotically turning
into a triple point. Using a novel expansion of the renormalization group
recursion relations near the isotropic fixed point, combined with a resummation
of the sixth-order diagrammatic expansions of the coefficients in this
expansion, we show that the above crossover is slow, explaining the apparently
observed second-order transition. However, the effective critical exponents
near that transition, which are calculated here, vary strongly as the triple
point is approached.

<br>
<br>
In the present work, authors focused on verifying structural and mechanical
properties of Oxide Dispersed Strengthening (ODS) steels strengthened by three
different types of refractory oxides submitted to ion-irradiation. Three
materials strengthened with Y2O3 or Al2O3 or ZrO2 were produced by mechanical
alloying and Spark Plasma Sintering technique. Specimens have been submitted to
high energy Ar-ion irradiation at room temperature with three fluences. This
procedure allowed to generate strongly damaged zone with a thickness of 230nm.
SEM/EBSD and TEM observations, GIXRD analysis, and nanoindentation tests have
been included in examination of modified layers. Investigation revealed
alteration of structural and mechanical features as a result of Ar-irradiation.
Obtained results showed a strong correlation between the strengthening oxide
and materials' behavior under radiation damage. It has been proved that below
1x1015ions/cm2 mechanical properties in the modified layer of all materials are
very similar. Reported behavior may be related to the efficient annealing of
the radiation defect process. Above this limit, significant differences between
the materials are visible. It is believed that described phenomenon is directly
related to the presence of the structural features and their capacity to act as
defect sinks. Consequently, type of dominant mechanisms occurring in modified
layer is proposed.

An asymptotically exact first-order shear deformation theory for functionally
graded elastic plates is derived using the variational-asymptotic method. As an
application, an analytical solution to the problem of wave propagation in a
sandwich plate is found in accordance with this refined theory. Comparison
between the dispersion curves obtained by 2-D plate theory and 3-D elasticity
theory reveals that the former is accurate up to the order of h^2/l^2, where h
is the plate thickness and l the wavelength.

<br>
<br>
We studied the in-plane angular magnetoresistance (AMR), in the normal state,
of underdoped superconducting Sr1-xLaxCuO2 , which has the simplest crystal
structure among cuprates. The measurements of two underdoped thin films with
different dopings were performed in intense magnetic field H (up to 22 T). The
longitudinal magnetoresistance at temperature T is negative and scales with
H/T. For both samples, the AMR is anisotropic and shows an unexpected
dependence on H intensity. While at the low magnetic field, one observes
essentially twofold AMR oscillations for the more doped sample, fourfold ones
start to grow under the high magnetic field, resulting in the coexistence of
the two. For the less doped film at the low magnetic field, both twofold and
fourfold AMR components exist. With the increase of the magnetic field, the
fourfold component survives a pi/4 phase shift, during which its amplitude
vanishes, at a magnetic field Hc such as: 16 T < Hc < 17 T. As a result, at the
high magnetic field above Hc, the angular dependence of the in-plane
magnetoresistance turns out to be the same for both samples. We tentatively
ascribe the above features to the presence of anti-ferromagnetism in the CuO2
planes of underdoped Sr1-xLaxCuO2.

We consider a twisted magnetic bilayer subject to the perpendicular electric
field. The interplay of induced Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interaction and
spatially varying moir\'e exchange potential results in complex non-collinear
magnetic phases in these structures. We numerically demonstrate the coexistence
of intralayer skyrmions and bound interlayer skyrmion pairs and show that they
are characterized by distinct dynamics under the action of external in-plane
electric field. Specifically we demonstrate the railing behaviour of skyrmions
along the domain walls which could find applications in spintronic devices
based on van der Waals magnets.

Hall states in magnetically (Cr and V) doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3 thin films grown on

transitions near coercive fields of Cr-doped and V-doped layers are visualized
in the field-dependent results. Our work establishes the experimental platform

ex-situ deposition which we relate to differences in magnetron sputtering
conditions and chamber geometry. The Nb films have critical temperatures of
around $9 \textrm{K}$. and critical perpendicular magnetic fields of up to
$B_{c2} = 1.4 \textrm{T}$ at $4.2 \textrm{K}$. From STEM images of the GaAs-Nb
interface we find the formation of an amorphous interlayer between the GaAs and
the Nb for both the ex-situ and in-situ deposited material.

In future solar cell technologies, the thermodynamic Shockley-Queisser limit
for solar-to-current conversion in traditional p-n junctions could potentially
be overcome with a bulk photovoltaic effect by creating an inversion broken
symmetry in piezoelectric or ferroelectric materials. Here, we unveiled
mechanical distortion-induced bulk photovoltaic behavior in a two-dimensional
material (2D), MoTe2, caused by phase transition and broken inversion symmetry
in MoTe2. The phase transition from single-crystalline semiconducting 2H-MoTe2
to semi-metallic 1T-MoTe2 was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). We used a micrometer-scale system to measure the absorption of energy,
which reduced from 800 meV to 63 meV when phase transformation from hexagonal
to distorted octahedral and revealed a smaller bandgap semi-metallic behavior.
Experimentally, a large bulk photovoltaic response is anticipated with the
maximum photovoltage VOC = 16 mV and a positive signal of the ISC = 60 uA (400
nm, 90.4 Wcm-2) in the absence of an external electric field. The maximum
values of both R and EQE were found to be 98 mAW-1 and 30 %, respectively. Our
findings unveil distinctive features of the photocurrent responses caused by
in-plane polarity and its potential from a wide pool of established TMD-based
nanomaterials, and a novel approach to reach high efficiency in converting
photons-to-electricity for power harvesting optoelectronics devices.

<h3>Evolution of dislocation loops in irradiated α-Uranium: An  atomistically-informed cluster dynamics investigation</h3>

An atomistically informed mean field cluster dynamics model has been
presented to investigate the nucleation and growth of defect loops in
irradiated {\alpha}-U. TEM analysis of neutron irradiated {\alpha}-U shows the
evolution of SIA and vacancy loops on (010) and (100) crystallographic planes
respectively, resulting in an anisotropic swelling of the face-centered
orthorhombic crystal. The accumulation of such loops, on irradiation, has been
closely estimated using the cluster dynamics model. Parameters of the model,
namely, the binding energy of point defects, i.e., Ui and VU, to SIA and
vacancy loops respectively and the diffusivity of point defects govern the
energetics and kinetics of the defect clustering phenomenon. We have studied
the crystallography of defect loops and computed the binding energy of point
defects to such loops using an angular dependent EAM potential in classical MD
simulations. Using bond-boost hyperdynamics in LAMMPS, the anisotropic
diffusion of Ui and VU in {\alpha}-U has been investigated. The mechanisms of
point defect diffusion and the associated migration energies have also been
reported and compared with previous DFT studies. Our CD model uses the computed
parameters, within their error ranges, to predict the population of defect
clusters with a dose-rate and temperature similar to the neutron irradiation
experiments. The predictions show an accumulation of small sized vacancy loops
along with a population of large and growing SIA loops which closely
corresponds to the TEM observations.

We use photoemission electron microscopy to measure the ferroelastic twin
wall angles at the surface of CaTiO$_\mathrm{3}$(001) and deduce the strain
ordering. We analyze the angular dependence of the photoelectron emission from
different domain surfaces, each with their own characteristic tilt angle in the
factory roof-like topography. By considering the surface topography as a field
perturbation, the offset in the photoemission threshold can be directly related
to the tilt angles. With knowledge of the symmetry allowed twin walls we
quantify twin topography between 179.1{\deg} to 180.8{\deg}.

Excitonic effects due to the correlation of electrons and holes in excited
states of matter dominate the optical spectra of many interesting materials.
They are usually studied in the long-wavelength limit. Here we investigate
excitons at non-vanishing momentum transfer, corresponding to shorter
wavelengths. We calculate the exciton dispersion in the prototypical layered
oxide V$_2$O$_5$ by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation of many-body
perturbation theory. We discuss the change of excitation energy and intensity
as a function of wavevector for bright and dark excitons, respectively, and we
analyze the origin of the excitons along their dispersion. We highlight the
important role of the electron-hole exchange with its impact on the exciton
dispersion, the singlet-triplet splitting and the difference between the
imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function and the loss function.

We estimate phase boundaries of four ordered and two spin-liquid phases for
the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model using four kinds of
relatively-small clusters, based on the second derivative of ground-state
energy. The estimated values are compared between the clusters as well as the
previous iPEPS results. We thus find that the boundaries can be accurately
estimated within limited-size clusters. The used clusters may appropriate to
study higher-$S$ KH models having less fluctuations.

Mechanical pressure controls the structural, electric, and magnetic order in
solid state systems, allowing to tailor and improve their physical properties.
A well-established example is ferroelastic ferroelectrics, where the coupling
between pressure and the primary symmetry breaking order parameter enables
hysteretic switching of the strain state and ferroelectric domain engineering.
Here, we study the pressure-driven response in a non-ferroelastic
ferroelectric, ErMnO3, where the classical stress-strain coupling is absent,
and the domain formation is governed by creation-annihilation processes of
topological defects. By annealing ErMnO3 polycrystals under variable pressures
in the MPa-regime, we transform non-ferroelastic vortex-like domains into
stripe-like domains. The width of the stripe-like domains is determined by the
applied pressure as we confirm by three-dimensional phase field simulations,
showing that pressure leads to highly oriented layer-like periodic domains. Our
work demonstrates the possibility to utilize mechanical pressure for domain
engineering in non-ferroelastic ferroelectrics, providing a
processing-accessible lever to control their dielectric, electromechanical, and
piezoelectric response.

<h3>Scaling law of the Hall coefficient in cuprates</h3>

<i>Yi-feng Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
One parameter scaling of the Hall coefficient of cuprates has been well known
for almost three decades, but still lacks a simple mathematical expression.
Motivated by the recent phenomenological prediction of the universal scaling of
the thermal Hall conductivity, we propose here a simple scaling function for
the Hall coefficient in cuprates that varies exponentially with the
temperature. Comparison with experimental data in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$,
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$, and Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$CuO$_{6+\delta }$
confirms its validity over a wide temperature and doping range. The scaling is
independent of microscopic details and arises as long as the hole carriers have
nonzero Berry curvature density within a finite energy window, possibly due to
their interaction with the spin liquid. This differs from the activation model
proposed previously to explain the Hall coefficient at low doping and high
temperatures, and suggests a unified picture in line with the one parameter
scaling observed in many physical quantities of cuprates.

Atom-based quantum simulators have had tremendous success in tackling
challenging quantum many-body problems, owing to the precise and dynamical
control that they provide over the systems' parameters. They are, however,
often optimized to address a specific type of problems. Here, we present the
design and implementation of a $^6$Li-based quantum gas platform that provides
wide-ranging capabilities and is able to address a variety of quantum many-body
problems. Our two-chamber architecture relies on a robust and easy-to-implement
combination of gray molasses and optical transport from a laser-cooling chamber
to a glass cell with excellent optical access. There, we first create unitary
Fermi superfluids in a three-dimensional axially symmetric harmonic trap and
characterize them using in situ thermometry, reaching temperatures below 20 nK.
This allows us to enter the deep superfluid regime with samples of extreme
diluteness, where the interparticle spacing is sufficiently large for direct
single-atom imaging. Secondly, we generate optical lattice potentials with
triangular and honeycomb geometry in which we study diffraction of molecular
Bose-Einstein condensates, and show how going beyond the Kapitza-Dirac regime
allows us to unambiguously distinguish between the two geometries. With the
ability to probe quantum many-body physics in both discrete and continuous
space, and its suitability for bulk and single-atom imaging, our setup
represents an important step towards achieving a wide-scope quantum simulator.

Over the past few decades, finding new superconductors with a high critical
temperature ($T_c$) has been a challenging task due to computational and
experimental costs. In this work, we present a diffusion model inspired by the
computer vision community to generate new superconductors with unique
structures and chemical compositions. Specifically, we used a crystal diffusion
variational autoencoder (CDVAE) along with atomistic line graph neural network
(ALIGNN) pretrained models and the Joint Automated Repository for Various
Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) superconducting database of density functional
theory (DFT) calculations to generate new superconductors with a high success
rate. We started with a DFT dataset of $\approx$1000 superconducting materials
to train the diffusion model. We used the model to generate 3000 new
structures, which along with pre-trained ALIGNN screening results in 62
candidates. For the top candidate structures, we carried out further DFT
calculations to validate our findings. Such approaches go beyond the typical
funnel-like materials design approaches and allow for the inverse design of
next-generation materials.

Laser-driven coherent phonons can act as modulated strain fields and modify
the adiabatic ground state topology of quantum materials. We use time-dependent
first-principles and effective model calculations to simulate the effect of a
strong terahertz electric field on electronic carriers in the topological
insulator ZrTe$_5$. We show that a coherent $A_\text{1g}$ Raman mode modulation
can effectively pump carriers across the band gap, even though the phonon
energy is about an order of magnitude smaller than the equilibrium band gap. We
reveal the microscopic mechanism of this effect which occurs via
Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg tunneling of Bloch electrons in a narrow region in
the Brillouin zone center where the transient energy gap closes when the system
switches from strong to weak topological insulator. The quantum dynamics
simulation results are in excellent agreement with recent pump-probe
experiments in ZrTe$_5$ at low temperature.

The interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and topology can result
in exotic quantum states of matter. A celebrated example is the quantum
anomalous Hall (QAH) state, which exhibits an integer quantum Hall effect at
zero magnetic field thanks to its intrinsic ferromagnetism. In the presence of
strong electron-electron interactions, exotic fractional-QAH (FQAH) states at
zero magnetic field can emerge. These states could host fractional excitations,
including non-Abelian anyons - crucial building blocks for topological quantum
computation. Flat Chern bands are widely considered as a desirable venue to
realize the FQAH state. For this purpose, twisted transition metal
dichalcogenide homobilayers in rhombohedral stacking have recently been
predicted to be a promising material platform. Here, we report experimental
signatures of FQAH states in 3.7-degree twisted MoTe2 bilayer. Magnetic
circular dichroism measurements reveal robust ferromagnetic states at
fractionally hole filled moir\'e minibands. Using trion photoluminescence as a
sensor, we obtain a Landau fan diagram which shows linear shifts in carrier
densities corresponding to the v=-2/3 and -3/5 ferromagnetic states with
applied magnetic field. These shifts match the Streda formula dispersion of
FQAH states with fractionally quantized Hall conductance of -2/3$e^2/h$ and
-3/5$e^2/h$, respectively. Moreover, the v=-1 state exhibits a dispersion
corresponding to Chern number -1, consistent with the predicted QAH state. In
comparison, several non-ferromagnetic states on the electron doping side do not
disperse, i.e., are trivial correlated insulators. The observed topological
states can be further electrically driven into topologically trivial states.
Our findings provide clear evidence of the long-sought FQAH states, putting
forward MoTe2 moir\'e superlattices as a fascinating platform for exploring
fractional excitations.

Boron nitride (BN) is an exceptional material and among its polymorphs,
two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal and three-dimensional (3D) cubic BN (h-BN and
c-BN) phases are most common. The phase stability regimes of these BN phases
are still under debate and phase transformations of h-BN/c-BN remain a topic of
interest. Here, we investigate the phase stability of 2D/3D h-BN/c-BN
nanocomposites and show that the co-existence of two phases can lead to strong
non-linear optical properties and low thermal conductivity at room temperature.
Furthermore, spark-plasma sintering of the nanocomposite shows complete phase
transformation to 2D h-BN with improved crystalline quality, where 3D c-BN
grain sizes governs the nucleation and growth kinetics. Our demonstration might
be insightful in phase engineering of BN polymorphs based nanocomposites with
desirable properties for optoelectronics and thermal energy management
applications.

We investigate interdomain excitations in composite systems of topological
orders separated by gapped domain walls. We derive two domain-wall Verlinde
formulae that relate the braiding between interdomain excitations and
domain-wall quasiparticles to the fusion rules of interdomain excitations and
the fusion rules of domain-wall quasiparticles. We show how to compute such
braiding and fusion with explicit non-Abelian examples and find that the fusion
rules of interdomain excitations are generally fractional or irrational. By
exploring the correspondence between composite systems and anyon condensation,
we uncover why such fusion rules should be called symmetry fractionalized
(irrationalized) fusion rules. Our domain-wall Verlinde formulae generalize the
Verlinde formula of a single topological order and the defect Verlinde formula
found in [C. Shen and L.-Y. Hung, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 051602 (2019)]. Our
results may find applications in topological quantum computing, topological
field theories, and conformal field theories.

Arrays of Rydberg atoms in the blockade regime realize a wealth of strongly
correlated quantum physics, but theoretical analysis beyond the chain is rather
difficult. Here we study a tractable model of Rydberg-blockade atoms on the
square ladder with a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and at most
one excited atom per square. We find $D_4$, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3$
density-wave phases separated by critical and first-order quantum phase
transitions. A non-invertible remnant of $U(1)$ symmetry applies to our full
three-parameter space of couplings, and its presence results in a larger
critical region as well as two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_3$-broken phases. Along an
integrable line of couplings, the model exhibits a self-duality that is
spontaneously broken along a first-order transition. Aided by numerical
results, perturbation theory and conformal field theory, we also find critical
Ising$^2$ and three-state Potts transitions, and provide good evidence that the
latter can be chiral.
