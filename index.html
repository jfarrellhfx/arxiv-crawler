Recently, Cu-substituted lead apatite LK-99 was reported to have
room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductivity. Here we utilize density
functional theory (DFT) total energy and harmonic phonon calculations to
investigate the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of two lead phosphate
apatites in their pure and Cu-substituted structures. Though
Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O and Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$(OH)$_2$ are found to be
thermodynamically stable (i.e., on the T=0K ground state convex hull), their
Cu-substituted counterparts are above the convex hull. Harmonic phonon
calculations reveal dynamic instabilities in all four of these structures.
Oxygen vacancy formation energies demonstrate that the addition of Cu dopant
substituting for Pb increases the likelihood of the formation of oxygen
vacancies on the anion site. We propose a new possible phase in this system,
Pb$_8$Cu$_2$(PO$_4$)$_6$, where two monovalent Cu atoms are substituted for two
Pb(1) atoms and the anion oxygen is removed. We also propose several reaction
pathways for Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O and Pb$_8$Cu$_2$(PO$_4$)$_6$, and found that
both of these two structures are likely to be synthesized under a 1:1 ratio of
reactants Pb$_2$SO$_5$ and Cu$_3$P. Our work provides a thorough foundation for
the thermodynamic and dynamic stabilities of LK-99 related compounds and we
propose several possible novel synthesis reaction pathways and a new predicted
structure for future studies.

<h3>Controlling Majorana hybridization in magnetic chain-superconductor  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07961</a>
<br>
<i>Oladunjoye A. Awoga, Ioannis Ioannidis, Archana Mishra, Martin Leijnse, Mircea Trif, Thore Posske</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose controlling the hybridization between Majorana zero modes at the
ends of magnetic adatom chains on superconductors by an additional magnetic
adatom deposited close by. By tuning the additional adatom's magnetization,
position, and coupling to the superconductor, we can couple and decouple the
Majorana modes as well as control the ground state parity. The scheme is
independent of microscopic details in ferromagnetic and helical magnetic chains
on superconductors with and without spin-orbit coupling, which we show by
studying their full microscopic models and their common low-energy description.
Our results show that scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance
techniques are promising tools for controlling the Majorana hybridization in
magnetic adatoms-superconductor setups, providing a basis for Majorana parity
measurements, fusion, and braiding techniques.

<br>
<br>
We develop an exactly solvable model with Kitaev-type interactions and study
its phase diagram on the dual lattice of the quasicrystalline Ammann-Beenker
lattice. Our construction is based on the $\Gamma$-matrix generalization of the
Kitaev model and utilizes the cut-and-project correspondence between the
four-dimensional simple cubic lattice and the Ammann-Beenker lattice to
designate four types of bonds. We obtain a rich phase diagram with gapped
(chiral and abelian) and gapless spin liquid phases via Monte Carlo simulations
and variational analysis. We show that the ground state can be further tuned by
the inclusion of an onsite term that selects 21 different vison configurations
while maintaining the integrability of the model. Our results highlight the
rich physics at the intersection of quasicrystals and quantum magnetism.

<h3>Energy Conversion and Entropy Production in Biased Random Walk Processes  -- from Discrete Modeling to the Continuous Limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07985" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07985</a>

<br>
<br>
We consider discrete and continuous representations of a thermodynamic
process in which a random walker (e.g. a molecular motor on a molecular track)
uses a periodically pumped energy (work) to pass $N$ sites and move
energetically downhill while dissipating heat. Interestingly, we find that,
starting from a discrete model, the limit in which the motion becomes
continuous in space and time ($N\to \infty$) is not unique and depends on what
physical observables are assumed to be unchanged in the process. In particular,
one may (as usually done) choose to keep the speed and diffusion coefficient
fixed during this limiting process, in which case the entropy production is
affected. In addition, we study also processes in which the entropy production
is kept constant as $N\to \infty$ at the cost of modified speed or diffusion
coefficient. Furthermore, we also combine this dynamics with work against an
opposing force, which makes it possible to study the effect of discretization
of the process on the thermodynamic efficiency of transferring power input to
power output. Interestingly, we find that the efficiency is increased in the
limit of $N\to\infty$. Finally, we investigate the same process when
transitions between sites can only happen at finite time intervals and study
the impact of this time discretization on the thermodynamic variables as the
continuous limit is approached.

<h3>A Spin Field Effect Transistor Based on a Strained Two Dimensional Layer  of a Weyl Semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07986</a>

<br>
<br>
Spin field effect transistors (SpinFET) are an iconic class of spintronic
devices that exploit gate tuned spin-orbit interaction in semiconductor
channels interposed between ferromagnetic source and drain contacts to elicit
transistor functionality. Recently, a new type of SpinFET based on gate tuned
strain in quantum materials (e.g. topological insulators) has been proposed and
may have interesting analog applications, such as in frequency multiplication,
by virtue of its unusual oscillatory transfer characteristic. Here, we propose
and analyze yet another type of SpinFET in this class, which may have a
different application. It is based on a Weyl semimetal. Because the operating
principle is non-classical, the channel conductance shows oscillatory
dependence on the channel length at zero gate voltage. Furthermore, the
transconductance can switch sign if the channel length is varied. This latter
feature can be exploited to implement a complementary device like CMOS by
connecting two such SpinFETs of slightly different channel lengths in series.
These unusual properties may have niche applications.

<h3>Interplay between particle trapping and heterogeneity in anomalous  diffusion</h3>

<br>
Heterogeneous media diffusion is often described using position-dependent
diffusion coefficients and estimated indirectly through mean squared
displacement in experiments. This approach may overlook other mechanisms and
their interaction with position-dependent diffusion, potentially leading to
erroneous conclusions. Here, we introduce a hybrid diffusion model that merges
a position-dependent diffusion coefficient with the trapping mechanism of the
comb model. We derive exact solutions for position distributions and mean
squared displacements, validated through simulations of Langevin equations. Our
model shows that the trapping mechanism attenuates the impact of media
heterogeneity. Superdiffusion occurs when the position-dependent coefficient
increases superlinearly, while subdiffusion occurs for sublinear and inverse
power-law relations. This nontrivial interplay between heterogeneity and
state-independent mechanisms also leads to anomalous yet Brownian and
non-Brownian yet Gaussian regimes. These findings emphasize the need for
cautious interpretations of experiments and highlight the limitations of
relying solely on mean squared displacements or position distributions for
diffusion characterization.

<h3>On the influence of the "donor"/"acceptor" presence on the excitation  states in molecular chains: non-adiabatic polaron approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08021</a>
<br>
<i>V. Matic, Z. Ivic, Z. Przulj, D. Chevizovich</i>
<br>
<br>
In the paper, we considered a molecular structure that consists of a
molecular chain and an additional molecule ("donor"/"acceptor") that can inject
(or remove) single excitation (vibron, electron, e.t.c.) onto the molecular
chain. We assumed that the excitation forms a self-trapped state due to the
interaction with mechanical oscillations of chain structure elements. We
analyzed the energy spectra of the excitation and showed that its state (when
it migrates to the molecular chain) has the properties of the non-adiabatic
polaron state. The conditions under which the excitation can migrate from one
subsystem to another were considered. It was shown that the presence of a
"donor" molecule cannot significantly change the properties of the excitation
located on the molecular chain. At the same time, the molecular chain can
affect the position of the energy level of the excitation localized on the
"donor" subsystem. Indirectly, this can influence the process of excitation
migration from one subsystem to another one. The influence of basic energy
parameters of the system and the environment temperature on this process are
discussed. The entire system was assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the
environment.

<h3>Tunable topological magnon-polaron states and anomalous Hall phenomena  in two-dimensional ferromagnetic insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08048" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08048</a>
<br>
<i>Jostein N. KlÃ¸getvedt, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</i>
<br>
<br>
We study magnon-polaron hybrid states, mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and
magnetoelastic interactions, in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator. The
magnetic system consists of both in-plane and flexural acoustic and optical
phonon bands, as well as acoustic and optical magnon bands. Through
manipulation of the ground-state magnetization direction using a magnetic
field, we demonstrate the tunability of Chern numbers and (spin) Berry
curvatures of magnon-polaron hybrid bands. This adjustment subsequently
modifies two anomalous Hall responses of the system, namely, thermal Hall and
spin Nernset signals. Notably, we find that by changing the magnetic field
direction in particular directions, it is possible to completely suppress the
thermal Hall signal while maintaining a finite spin Nernst signal. Our finding
reveals the intricate interplay between topological and quantum geometrical
phenomena and magnetic ordering, offering compelling avenues for on-demand
control over emergent quantum states in condensed matter systems.

<h3>Deterministic Spin-Orbit Torque Switching of Mn3Sn with the Interplay  between Spin Polarization and Kagome Plane</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08091" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08091</a>
<br>
<i>Zhengde Xu, Xue Zhang, Yixiao Qiao, Gengchiau Liang, Shuyuan Shi, Zhifeng Zhu</i>
<br>
<br>
Previous studies have demonstrated spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of Mn3Sn
where the spin polarization lies in the kagome plane (configuration I).
However, the critical current density ($ J_{crit}$) is unrealistically large ($
J_{crit}$=$ 10^{14}$ A/$ m^2$) and independent on the external field ($
H_{ext}$). The stabilized magnetic state also depends on the initial state.
These features conflict with the ferromagnet (FM) switching scheme as claimed
in those studies, and thus call for other explanations. Alternatively, the
system with the spin polarization perpendicular to the kagome plane
(configuration II) is more like the FM based system since the spin polarization
is orthogonal to all magnetic moments. In this work, we show SOT switching of
Mn3Sn in configuration II. Similar to the FM, Jcrit and Hext are in the order
of $ 10^{10}$ A/$ m^2$ and hundreds of Oersted, respectively. The switching
result is also independent of the initial state. Interestingly, the unique spin
structure of Mn3Sn also leads to distinct features from FM systems. We
demonstrate that Jcrit increases linearly with Hext, and extrapolation gives
ultralow $ J_{crit}$ for the field-free switching system. In addition, the
switching polarity is opposite to the FM. We also provide the switching phase
diagram as a guideline for experimental demonstration. Our work provides
comprehensive understanding for the switching mechanism in both configurations.
The switching protocol proposed in this work is more advantageous in realistic
spintronic applications. We also clearly reveal the fundamental difference
between FM and noncollinear antiferromagnetic switching.

<h3>Structural Investigation of BaIrO$_3$ by Neutron Diffraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08109" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08109</a>
<br>
<i>Bin Chang, Jinwon Jeong, Han-Jin Noh, Seongsu Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a temperature-dependent neutron diffraction (ND) study on
polycrystalline monoclinic BaIrO$_3$ which is famous for charge density wave
(CDW) and weak ferromagnetic phase transitions at T$_C$$\sim$180 K
simultaneously. A Rietveld analysis on the ND patterns reveals that even though
there is no symmetry breaking in crystal structure, a noticeable change in the
four kinds of IrO$_{6}$ octahedra is isolated as the temperature approaches to
T$_C$. Based on the structure analysis results, we calculated the $d$-orbital
energy level splittings by crystal electric field for each type of the IrO$_6$
octahedra. By taking into account the strong spin-orbit coupling in Ir 5$d$
orbitals and the lattice distortions obtained from the ND analysis, we propose
an electronic configuration model to understand the phase transition of the
system, where an effective $J_{\rm eff, 1/2}$ Mott insulating phase and a
charge gap phase induced by bonding states between the $J_{\rm eff,1/2}$ states
compete each other.

<h3>Dimensional reduction of Kitaev spin liquid at quantum criticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08116" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08116</a>
<br>
<i>Shi Feng, Adhip Agarwala, Nandini Trivedi</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the fate of the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) under the influence
of an external magnetic field $h$ in the [001] direction and upon tuning bond
anisotropy of the Kitaev coupling $K_z$ keeping $K_x = K_y = K$. Guided by
density matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization, and with insights
from parton mean field theory, we uncover a field-induced gapless-to-gapless
Lifshitz transition from the nodal KSL to an intermediate gapless phase. The
intermediate phase sandwiched between $h_{c1}$ and $h_{c2}$, which persists for
a wide range of anisotropy $K_z/K > 0$, is composed of weakly coupled
one-dimensional quantum critical chains, and asymptotically approaches the
one-dimensional quantum Ising criticality characterized by the (1+1)D conformal
field theory with a central charge $c=\frac{1}{2}$ as the field approaches the
phase transition at $h_{c2}$. Beyond $h_{c2}$ the system enters a partially
polarized phase describable as effectively decoupled bosonic chains in which
spin waves propagate along the one-dimensional zigzag direction. Our findings
provide a comprehensive phase diagram and offer insights into the unusual
physics of dimensional reduction generated by a uniform magnetic field in an
otherwise two-dimensional quantum spin liquid.

<br>
<br>
Moir\'e superlattices of transitional metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong
electron-electron interaction that has led to experimental observations of Mott
insulators and generalized Wigner crystals. In this letter, we report direct
measurements of the thermodynamic gaps of these correlated insulating states in
a dual-gate WS2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayer. We employ the microwave impedance
microscopy to probe the electronic features in both the graphene top gate and
the moir\'e bilayer, from which we extract the doping dependence of the
chemical potential of the moir\'e bilayer and the energy gaps for various
correlated insulating states utilizing the Landau quantization of graphene.
These gaps are relatively insensitive to the application of an external
electric field to the WS2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayer.

<h3>Investigation of charge carrier dynamics in Ti3C2Tx MXene for ultrafast  photonics applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08141</a>
<br>
<i>Ankita Rawat, Nitesh K. Chourasia, Saurabh K. Saini, Gaurav Rajput, Aditya Yadav, Ritesh Kumar Chourasia, Govind Gupta, P. K. Kulriya</i>
<br>
<br>
The rapid advancement of nanomaterials has paved the way for various
technological breakthroughs, and MXenes, in particular, have gained substantial
attention due to their unique properties such as high conductivity,
broad-spectrum absorption strength, and tunable band gap. This article presents
the impact of the process parameters on the structural and optical properties
of Ti3C2Tx MXene for application in ultrafast dynamics. XRD along with Raman
spectroscopy studies, confirmed the synthesis of a single phase from their MAX
phase Ti3AlC2. The complete etching of Al and increase in the interplanar
distance is also observed on centrifugation at very high speed. The ultrafast
transient absorption spectroscopy used to understand the effect of centrifuge
speed on the charge carrier dynamics and ultrafast spectrum of MXene displayed
that the carrier lifetime is critically influenced by rotation per minute (rpm)
e.g. faster decay lifetime at 10k rpm than 7k rpm. The electronic relaxation
probed using the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) technique exhibits an
average decay time of 5.13 ns and 5.35 ns at the 7k and 10k rpm, respectively,
which confirms that the optical properties of the MXene are strongly affected
by the centrifuge speed. The synthesized MXene at 10k rpm typically suggests
that radiative processes due to longer decay lifetime and experiences fewer
nonradiative losses, resulting in enhanced luminescence properties.

<h3>Correlated flat bands in the paramagnetic phase of triangular  antiferromagnets Na$_2$BaX(PO$_4$)$_2$ (X = Mn, Co, Ni)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08149" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08149</a>
<br>
<i>Cong Hu, Xuefeng Zhang, Yunlong Su, Gang Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Flat band systems in condensed matter physics are intriguing because they can
exhibit exotic phases and unconventional properties. In this work, we studied
three correlated magnetic systems, Na$_2$BaX(PO$_4$)$_2$ (X = Mn, Co, Ni), and
revealed their unusual electronic structure and magnetic properties. Despite
their different effective angular momentum, our first-principles calculations
showed a similar electronic structure among them. However, their different
valence configurations led to different responses to electronic correlations in
the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. Using the dynamical mean-field method,
we found that all systems can be understood as a multi-band Hubbard model with
Hund'ss coupling. Our calculations of spin susceptibility and the {\it
ab-initio} estimation of magnetic exchange coupling indicated strong
intra-plane antiferromagnetic coupling and weak inter-plane coupling in all
systems. The ground states of these systems are largely degenerate. It is
likely that none of these magnetic states would dominate over the others,
leading to the possibility of quantum spin liquid states in these systems. Our
work unifies the understanding of these three structurally similar systems and
opens new avenues for exploring correlated flat bands with distinct electronic
and magnetic responses.

<br>
<br>
Graphene quantum dots are promising candidates for qubits due to weak
spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. The hyperfine interaction, controllable
via isotopic purification, could be the key to further improving the coherence.
Here, we use isotopically enriched graphite crystals of both $^{12}$C and
$^{13}$C grown by high-pressure-high-temperature method to exfoliate graphene
layers. We fabricated Hall bar devices and performed quantum transport
measurements, revealing mobilities exceeding $10^{5}$$\textrm{cm}^{2}/Vs$ and a
long mean free path of microns, which are as high as natural graphene.
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, quantum Hall effect up to the filling factor of
one, and Brown-Zak oscillations due to the alignment of hBN and graphene are
observed thanks to the high mobility. These results constitute a material
platform for physics and engineering of isotopically-enriched graphene qubits.

<h3>Macroscopic behavior of populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire  neurons subject to non-Gaussian white noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08194" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08194</a>
<br>
<i>Denis S. Goldobin, Evelina V. Permyakova, Lyudmila S. Klimenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We study microscopic dynamics of populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire
neurons subject to non-Gaussian noises; we argue that these noises must be
alpha-stable whenever they are delta-correlated (white). For the case of
additive-in-voltage noise, we derive the governing equation of the dynamics of
the characteristic function of the membrane voltage distribution and construct
a linear-in-noise perturbation theory. Specifically for the recurrent network
with global synaptic coupling, we theoretically calculate the observables:
population-mean membrane voltage and firing rate. The theoretical results are
underpinned by the results of numerical simulation for homogeneous and
heterogeneous populations. The possibility of the generalization of the
pseudocumulant approach to the case of a fractional $\alpha$ is examined for
both irrational and fractional rational $\alpha$. This examination seemingly
suggests the pseudocumulant approach or its modifications to be employable only
for the integer values of $\alpha=1$ (Cauchy noise) and 2 (Gaussian noise)
within the physically meaningful range (0;2]. Remarkably, the analysis for
fractional $\alpha$ indirectly revealed that, for the Gaussian noise, the
minimal asymptotically rigorous model reduction must involve three
pseudocumulants and the two-pseudocumulant model reduction is an artificial
approximation. This explains a surprising gain of accuracy for the
three-pseudocumulant models as compared to the the two-pseudocumulant ones
reported in the literature.

<h3>Promoting $p$-based Hall effects by $p$-$d$-$f$ hybridization in  Gd-based dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08207" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08207</a>
<br>
<i>Mahmoud Zeer, Dongwook Go, Peter Schmitz, Tom G. Saunderson, Hao Wang, Jamal Ghabboun, Stefan BlÃ¼gel, Wulf Wulfhekel, Yuriy Mokrousov</i>
<br>
<br>
We conduct a first-principles study of Hall effects in rare-earth
dichalcogenides, focusing on monolayers of the H-phase EuX$_2$ and GdX$_2$,
where X = S, Se, and Te. Our predictions reveal that all EuX$_2$ and GdX$_2$
systems exhibit high magnetic moments and wide bandgaps. We observe that while
in case of EuX$_2$ the $p$ and $f$ states hybridize directly below the Fermi
energy, the absence of $f$ and $d$ states of Gd at the Fermi energy results in
$p$-like spin-polarized electronic structure of GdX$_2$, which mediates
$p$-based magnetotransport. Notably, these systems display significant
anomalous, spin, and orbital Hall conductivities. We find that in GdX$_2$ the
strength of correlations controls the relative position of $p$, $d$ and
$f$-states and their hybridization which has a crucial impact on $p$-state
polarization and the anomalous Hall effect, but not the spin and orbital Hall
effect. Moreover, we find that the application of strain can significantly
modify the electronic structure of the monolayers, resulting in quantized
charge, spin and orbital transport in GdTe$_2$ via a strain-mediated orbital
inversion mechanism taking place at the Fermi energy. Our findings suggest that
rare-earth dichalcogenides hold promise as a platform for topological
spintronics and orbitronics.

<h3>Biaxial strain modulated electronic structures of layered  two-dimensional MoSiGeN4 Rashba systems</h3>

<i>Puxuan Li, Xuan Wang, Haoyu Wang, Qikun Tian, Jinyuan Xu, Linfeng Yu, Guangzhao Qin, Zhenzhen Qin</i>
<br>
<br>
The two-dimensional (2D) MA2Z4 family has received extensive attention in
manipulating its electronic structure and achieving intriguing physical
properties. However, engineering the electronic properties remains a challenge.
Herein, based on first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate
the effect of biaxial strains on the electronic structures of 2D Rashba
MoSiGeN4 (MSGN), and further explore how the interlayer interactions affect the
Rashba spin splitting in such strained layered MSGNs. After applying biaxial
strains, the band gap decreases monotonically with increasing tensile strains
but increases when the compressive strains are applied. An
indirect-direct-indirect band gap transition is induced by applying a moderate
compressive strain (< 5%) in the MSGNs. Due to the symmetry breaking and
moderate spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the monolayer MSGN possess an isolated
Rashba spin splitting (R) near the Fermi level, which could be effectively
regulated to the Lifshitz transition (L) by biaxial strain. For instance, a
L-R-L transformation of Fermi surface is presented in monolayer and a more
complex and changeable L-R-L-R evolution is observed in bilayer and trilayer
MSGNs as the biaxial strain vary from -8% to 12%, which actually depend on the
appearance, variation, and vanish of the Mexican hat band in the absence of SOC
under different strains. The contribution of Mo-dz2 orbital hybridized with
N-pz orbital in the highest valence band plays a dominant role on the band
evolution under biaxial strains, where the R-L evolution corresponds to the
decreased Mo-dz2 orbital contribution. Our study highlights the biaxial strain
controllable Rashba spin splitting, in particular the introduction and even the
evolution of Lifshitz transition near Fermi surface, which makes the strained
MSGNs as promising candidates for future applications in spintronic devices.

<h3>Dynamic motion of polar skyrmions in oxide heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Polar skyrmions have been widely investigated in oxide heterostructure
recently, due to their exotic properties and intriguing physical insights.
Meanwhile, so far, the external field-driven motion of the polar skyrmion, akin
to the magnetic counterpart, has yet to be discovered. Here, using phase-field
simulations, we demonstrate the dynamic motion of the polar skyrmions with
integrated external thermal, electrical, and mechanical stimuli. The external
heating reduces the spontaneous polarization hence the skyrmion motion barrier,
while the skyrmions shrink under the electric field, which could weaken the
lattice pinning and interactions between the skyrmions. The mechanical force
transforms the skyrmions into c-domain in the vicinity of the indenter center
under the electric field, providing the space and driving force needed for the
skyrmions to move. This study confirmed that the skyrmions are quasi-particles
that can move collectively, while also providing concrete guidance for the
further design of polar skyrmion-based electronic devices.

An eutectic AlCl$_3$/KCl molten salt method in a horizontal configuration was
employed to grow millimeter-sized and composition homogeneous CuFeSe$_2$ single
crystals due to the continuous growth process in a temperature gradient induced
solution convection. The typical as-grown CuFeSe$_2$ single crystals in cubic
forms are nearly 1.6$\times$1.2$\times$1.0 mm3 in size. The chemical
composition and homogeneity of the crystals was examined by both inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectrometer
with Cu:Fe:Se = 0.96:1.00:1.99 consistent with the stoichiometric composition
of CuFeSe$_2$. The magnetic measurements suggest a ferrimagnetic or weak
ferromagnetic transition below T$_C$ = 146 K and the resistivity reveals a
semiconducting behavior and an abrupt increase below T$_C$.

Star block copolymers (s-BCPs) have potential applications as novel
surfactants or amphiphiles for emulsification, compatbilization, chemical
transformations and separations. s-BCPs are star-shaped macromolecules
comprised of linear chains of different chemical blocks (e.g., solvophilic and
solvophobic blocks) that are covalently joined at one junction point. Various
parameters of these macromolecules can be tuned to obtain desired surface
properties, including the number of arms, composition of the arms, and the
degree-of-polymerization of the blocks (or the length of the arm). This makes
identification of the optimal s-BCP design highly non-trivial as the total
number of plausible s-BCPs architectures is experimentally or computationally
intractable. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled
with reinforcement learning based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to identify
s-BCPs designs that minimize the interfacial tension between polar and
non-polar solvents. We first validate the MCTS approach for design of small-
and medium-sized s-BCPs, and then use it to efficiently identify sequences of
copolymer blocks for large-sized s-BCPs. The structural origins of interfacial
tension in these systems are also identified using the configurations obtained
from MD simulations. Chemical insights on the arrangement of copolymer blocks
that promote lower interfacial tension were mined using machine learning (ML)
techniques. Overall, this work provides an efficient approach to solve design
problems via fusion of simulations and ML and provide important groundwork for
future experimental investigation of s-BCPs sequences for various applications.

The hybrid skyrmion, a type of magnetic skyrmion with intermediate helicity
between Bloch and N\'eel skyrmion, has gained more attraction. It is tolerant
toward the skyrmion Hall effect and a potential candidate for quantum bits. We
investigated the stabilization and helicity control of the hybrid skyrmion in a
two-dimensional magnetic system using an analytical model and micromagnetic
simulation. We look at the interplaying factors of the bulk ($D_b$) and
interfacial ($D_i$) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions along with the
dipolar interaction. We show that the hybrid skyrmion can stabilize through the
interplay between interfacial DM and either bulk DM or dipolar interaction. We
can also control the helicity of the hybrid skyrmion by tuning the ratio of
$D_i/D_b$ when there is no dipolar interaction, or simply by adjusting the
$D_i$ when the $D_b$ is absent. Our results suggest that hybrid skyrmions can
exist within $0 < |D_i| < 0.4$ mJ/m$^2$ for Co-based magnetic systems.

<br>
<br>
The measurement of interfacial mechanical or rheological properties in
polymer blends is a challenging task, as well as providing a quantitative link
between these properties and the interfacial nanostructure. Here, we perform a
systematic study of the extensional rheology of multilayer films of an
immsicible polymer pair, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate). We take
advantage of multinanolayer coextrusion to increase the number of interfaces up
to thousands, consequently magnifying the interfacial response of the films.
The transient elongational response is compared to an addivity rule model based
on the summation of the contribution of each polymer as well as the interfacial
one. At low strain rates, the model reproduces the transient extensional
viscosity up to strain-thinning, while at larger ones, the extra stress exceeds
the prediction based on constant interfacial tension. This extra-contribution
is attributed to an interphase modulus on the order of 1-10 MPa, which
increases with strain rate following a power-law with an exponent 1/3.
Extensional rheology of multinanolayer films is then an efficient combination
to go beyond interfacial tension and measure quantitatively the interfacial
rheology of immiscible polymer blends.

<br>
<br>
TaTe$_4$, a metallic charge-density wave (CDW) material discovered decades
ago, has attracted renewed attention due to its rich interesting properties
such as pressure-induced superconductivity and candidate non-trivial
topological phase. Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and ab-initio calculation, we systematically investigate the
electronic structure of TaTe$_4$. At 26 K, we observe a CDW gap as large as 290
meV, which persists up to 500 K. The CDW-modulated band structure shows a
complex reconstruction that closely correlates with the lattice distortion.
Inside the CDW gap, there exist highly dispersive energy bands contributing to
the remnant Fermi surface and metallic behavior in the CDW state.
Interestingly, our ab-initio calculation reveals that the large CDW gap mainly
opens in the electronic states with out-of-plane orbital components, while the
in-gap metallic states originate from in-plane orbitals, suggesting an orbital
texture that couples with the CDW order. Our results shed light on the
interplay between electron, lattice, and orbital in quasi-one-dimensional CDW
materials.

We review the theoretical description of the role of quantum geometry in
superfluidity and superconductivity of multiband systems, with focus on flat
bands where quantum geometry is wholly responsible for supercurrents. This
review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent
understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order
parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the
superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum
metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the
concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity
is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a
multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological
bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat
band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.

We present a novel phase-field approach for investigating solute segregation
in a moving grain boundary. In our model, the correct choice of various
parameters can control the solute-grain boundary interaction potential,
resulting in various segregation profiles that agree with Cahn solute drag
theory. Furthermore, we explore how different segregation profiles evolve at
varying GB velocities owing to the inequality of the atomic flux of solute
between the front and back faces of the moving grain boundary. We highlight
velocity variations among segregation profiles in low and high-velocity
regimes. This model reveals how grain boundary segregation affects grain
growth, providing insights for future alloy design

<h3>Lindblad master equation approach to the dissipative quench dynamics of  planar superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
We employ the Lindblad Master Equation method to study the nonequilibrium
dynamics following a parametric quench in the Hamiltonian of an open,
two-dimensional superconducting system coupled to an external bath. Within our
approach we show how, in the open system, the dissipation works as an effective
stabilization mechanism in the time evolution of the system after the quench.
Eventually, we evidence how the mismatch between the phases corresponding to
the initial and to the final state of the system determines a dynamical phase
transition between the two distinct phases. Our method allows for fully
characterizing the dynamical phase transition in an open system in several
cases of physical relevance, by means of a combined study of the time dependent
superconducting gap and of the fidelity between density matrices.

By quenching the interaction strength, we induce and study a topological
dynamical phase transition between superconducting phases of a planar fermionic
model. Using the Lindblad Master Equation approach to account for the
interactions of Bogoliubov quasiparticles among themselves and with the
fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, we derive the
corresponding relaxation dynamics of the order parameter. To fully characterize
the phase transition, we also compute the fidelity and the spin-Hall
conductance of the system. Our approach provides us crucial informations for
experimental implementations, such as the dependence of the critical time on
the system-bath coupling.

We consider the long-term evolution of an inhomogeneous long-range
interacting $N$-body system. Placing ourselves in the dynamically hot limit,
i.e. neglecting collective effects, we derive a large deviation principle for
the system's empirical angle-averaged distribution function. This result
extends the classical ensemble-averaged kinetic theory given by the so-called
inhomogeneous Landau equation, as it specifies the probability of typical and
large dynamical fluctuations. We detail the main properties of the associated
large deviation Hamiltonian, in particular how it complies with the system's
conservation laws and possesses a gradient structure.

<br>
<br>
Raman scattering excitation (RSE) is an experimental technique in which the
spectrum is made up by sweeping the excitation energy when the detection energy
is fixed. We study the low-temperature ($T$=5~K) RSE spectra measured on four
high quality monolayers (ML) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
(S-TMDs), $i.e.$ MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, encapsulated in
hexagonal BN. The outgoing resonant conditions of Raman scattering reveal an
extraordinary intensity enhancement of the phonon modes, which results in
extremely rich RSE spectra. The obtained spectra are composed not only of
Raman-active peaks, $i.e.$ in-plane E$'$ and out-of-plane A$'_1$, but the
appearance of 1$^{st}$, 2$^{nd}$, and higher-order phonon modes is recognised.
The intensity profiles of the A$'_1$ modes in the investigated MLs resemble the
emissions due to neutral excitons measured in the corresponding PL spectra for
the outgoing type of resonant Raman scattering conditions. Furthermore, for the
WSe$_2$ ML, the A$'_1$ mode was observed when the incoming light was in
resonance with the neutral exciton line. The strength of the exciton-phonon
coupling (EPC) in S-TMD MLs strongly depends on the type of their ground
excitonic state, $i.e.$ bright or dark, resulting in different shapes of the
RSE spectra. Our results demonstrate that RSE spectroscopy is a powerful
technique for studying EPC in S-TMD MLs.

<br>
<br>
A charge order has been discovered to emerge deep into the antiferromagnetic
phase of the kagome metal FeGe. To study its origin, the evolution of the
low-lying electronic structure across the charge order phase transition is
investigated with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We do not find
signatures of nesting between Fermi surface sections or van-Hove singularities
in zero-frequency joint density of states, and there are no obvious energy gaps
at the Fermi level, which exclude the nesting mechanism for the charge order
formation in FeGe. However, two obvious changes in the band structure have been
detected, i.e., one electron-like band around the K point and another one
around the A point move upward in energy position when the charge order forms.
These features can be well reproduced by our density-functional theory
calculations, where the charge order is primarily driven by magnetic energy
saving via large dimerizations of a quarter of Ge1-sites (in the kagome plane)
along the c-axis. Our results provide strong support for this novel charge
order formation mechanism in FeGe, in contrast to the conventional nesting
mechanism.

Distinguishing whether a system supports alternate low-energy (locally
stable) states -- stable (true vacuum) versus metastable (false vacuum) -- by
direct observation can be difficult when the lifetime of the state is very long
but otherwise unknown. Here we demonstrate, in a tractable model system, that
there are physical phenomena on much shorter time scales that can diagnose the
difference. Specifically, we study the spectral density following a quench in
the tilted quantum Ising model, and show that the evolution of the spectral
density is a powerful diagnostic. Small transition bubbles are more common than
large ones, and we see characteristic differences in the size dependence of
bubble lifetimes even well below the critical size for false vacuum decay. We
expect this sort of behavior to be generic in systems of this kind. We identify
a scaling limit that connects the discrete, simulatable model to continuum
quantum field theory.

<br>
<br>
In twisted two-dimensional (2D) magnets, the stacking dependence of the
magnetic exchange interaction can lead to regions of ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic interlayer order, separated by non-collinear, skyrmion-like
spin textures. Recent experimental searches for these textures have focused on
CrI$_3$, known to exhibit either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interlayer
order, depending on layer stacking. However, the very strong uniaxial
anisotropy of CrI$_3$ disfavors smooth non-collinear phases in twisted
bilayers. Here, we report the experimental observation of three distinct
magnetic phases -- one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic -- in exfoliated
CrBr$_3$ multilayers, and reveal that the uniaxial anisotropy is significantly
smaller than in CrI$_3$. These results are obtained by magnetoconductance
measurements on CrBr$_3$ tunnel barriers and Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction
with density functional theory calculations, which enable us to identify the
stackings responsible for the different interlayer magnetic couplings. The
detection of all locally stable magnetic states predicted to exist in CrBr$_3$
and the excellent agreement found between theory and experiments, provide
complete information on the stacking-dependent interlayer exchange energy and
establish twisted bilayer CrBr$_3$ as an ideal system to deterministically
create non-collinear magnetic phases.

Bulk photovoltaic effect, which arises from crystal symmetry-driven charge
carrier separation, is an intriguing physical phenomenon that has attracted
extensive interest in photovoltaic application due to its junction-free
photovoltaic and potential to surpass Shockley-Queisser limit. Whereas
conventional ferroelectric materials mostly suffer from extremely low
photocurrent density and weak photovoltaic response at visible light
wavelengths. Emerging two-dimensional ferroelectric semiconductors with coupled
visible light absorption and spontaneous polarization characteristics are a
promising alternative for making functional photoferroelectrics. Herein, we
report the experimental demonstration of the bulk photovoltaic effect behavior
based on the 2D ferroelectric semiconductor {$\alpha$-InSe caused by an
out-of-plane polarization induced depolarization field. The {$\alpha$-InSe
device exhibits enhanced bulk photovoltaic response in the visible light
spectrum owing to its narrow bandgap. It was demonstrated that the generated
photovoltaic current density was nearly two orders of magnitude greater than
conventional bulk ferroelectric materials. These findings highlight the
potential of 2D ferroelectric semiconductor materials for bulk photovoltaic
applications in a broad spectral region.

<h3>Equilibration between Translational and Rotational Modes in Molecular  Dynamics Simulations of Rigid Water Requires a Smaller Integration Time-Step  Than Often Used</h3>

<br>
<br>
In simulations of aqueous systems it is common to freeze the bond vibration
and angle bending modes in water to allow for a longer time-step $\delta t$ for
integrating the equations of motion. Thus $\delta t = 2$ fs is often used in
simulating rigid models of water. We simulate the SPC/E model of water using
$\delta t$ from 0.5 fs to 3.0 fs. We find that for all but $\delta = 0.5$ fs,
equipartition between translational and rotational modes is violated: the
rotational modes are at a lower temperature than the translation modes. The
autocorrelation of the velocities corresponding to the respective modes shows
that the rotational relaxation occurs at a time-scale comparable to vibrational
periods, invalidating the original assumption for freezing vibrations. $\delta
t$ also influences thermodynamic properties: the mean system potential energies
are not converged until $\delta t = 0.5$ fs, and the excess entropy of
hydration of a soft, repulsive cavity is also sensitive to $\delta t$.

<br>

We explore how the interplay of finite availability, carrying capacity of
particles at different parts of a spatially extended system and particle
diffusion between them control the steady state currents and density profiles
in a one-dimensional current-carrying channel connecting the different parts of
the system. To study this, we construct a minimal model consisting of two
particle reservoirs of finite carrying capacities connected by a totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). In addition to particle transport
via TASEP between the reservoirs, the latter can also directly exchange
particles, modeling particle diffusion between them that can maintain a steady
current in the system. We investigate the steady state density profiles and the
associated particle currents in the TASEP lane. The resulting phases and the
phase diagrams are quite different from an open TASEP, and are characterised by
the model parameters defining particle exchanges between the TASEP and the
reservoirs, direct particle exchanges between the reservoirs, and the filling
fraction of the particles that determines the total resources available. These
parameters can be tuned to make the density on the TASEP lane globally uniform
or piecewise continuous, and can make the two reservoirs preferentially
populated or depopulated.

Uniaxial pressure experiments in underdoped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\rm{y}}$
provide an efficient approach to the control of the competition between
charge-density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity. It can enhance the
correlation volume of ubiquitous short-range CDW correlations and above a
critical value, even induce a long-range CDW order otherwise only accessible
through the suppression of superconductivity by large magnetic fields. Here we
use x-ray diffraction with access to large areas of reciprocal space to study
the evolution of long- and short-range CDWs with in-plane strains and as a
function of doping. This further allows us to precisely monitor in-situ the
structural changes induced by uniaxial pressurization of the crystals for a
precise strain estimation in measurements up to $-0.85 \%$ compression.
Interestingly, we uncover direct evidence for a competition between long- and
short-range CDWs and show that the long-range CDW modulation remains
incommensurate at all investigated strains and temperatures, showing neither
signs of discommensurations nor a pair-density wave component at
$\lambda_{\rm{PDW}} = 2\lambda_{\rm{CDW}}$ below $T_c$. We discuss the impact
of structural disorder and the relationship of our findings to previous reports
on nematicity in high-temperature superconducting cuprates. More generally, our
results underscore the potential of strain tuning as a powerful tool for
probing and manipulating competing orders in quantum materials.

Predicting the rheology of dense suspensions under inhomogeneous flow is
crucial in many industrial and geophysical applications, yet the conventional
`$\mu(J)$' framework is limited to homogeneous conditions in which the shear
rate and solids fraction are spatially invariant. To address this shortcoming,
we use particle-based simulations of frictionless dense suspensions to derive
new constitutive laws that unify the rheological response under both
homogeneous and inhomogeneous conditions. By defining a new dimensionless
number associated with particle velocity fluctuations and combining it with the
viscous number, the macroscopic friction and the solids fraction, we obtain
scaling relations that collapse data from homogeneous and inhomogeneous
simulations. The relations allow prediction of the steady state velocity,
stress and volume fraction fields using only knowledge of the applied driving
force.

Quantum vortices in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are topological
defects characterized by quantized circulation of particles around them. In
experimental studies, vortices are commonly detected by time-of-flight imaging,
where their density-depleted cores are enlarged. In this work, we describe a
machine learning-based method for detecting vortices in experimental BEC
images, particularly focusing on turbulent condensates containing irregularly
distributed vortices. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN)
trained solely on synthetic simulated images, eliminating the need for manual
labeling of the vortex positions as ground truth. We find that the CNN achieves
accurate vortex detection in real experimental images, thereby facilitating
analysis of large experimental datasets without being constrained by specific
experimental conditions. This novel approach represents a significant
advancement in studying quantum vortex dynamics and streamlines the analysis
process in the investigation of turbulent BECs.

We investigate the interplay between altermagnetic spin-splitting and
nonsymmorphic symmetries using the space group no. 62 as a testbed. Studying
different magnetic orders by means of first-principles calculations, we find
that the altermagnetism (AM) is present in the C-type magnetic configuration
while it is absent for the G-type and A-type configurations due to different
magnetic space group types. The nonsymmorphic symmetries constrain the system
to a four-fold degeneracy at the border of the Brillouin zone with semi-Dirac
dispersion. In the case of large hybridization as for transition metal
pnictides, the interplay between AM and nonsymmorphic symmetries generates an
intricate network of several crossings and anticrossings that we describe in
terms of semi-Dirac points and glide symmetries. When we add the spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), we find a Neel-vector dependent spin-orbit splitting at the
time-reversal invariant momenta points since the magnetic space groups depend
on the Neel vector. The magnetic space group type-I produces antiferromagnetic
hourglass electrons that disappear in the type-III. When the Neel vector is
along x, we observe a glide-protected crossing that could generate a nodal-line
in the altermagnetic phase. The SOC splits the remaining band crossings and
band anticrossings producing a large anomalous Hall effect in all directions
excluding the Neel-vector direction

We show that lasing in flat band lattices can be stabilized by means of the
geometrical properties of the Bloch states, in settings where the
single-particle dispersion is flat in both its real and imaginary parts. We
illustrate a general projection method and compute the collective excitations,
which are shown to display a diffusive behavior ruled by quantum geometry
through a peculiar coefficient involving gain, losses and interactions. Then,
we analytically show that the phase dynamics display a surprising cancellation
of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang nonlinearity at the leading order. Because of the

Thermodynamic equilibrium is a unique state characterized by time-reversal
symmetry, which enforces zero fluxes and prohibits work extraction from a
single thermal bath. By virtue of being microscopically out of equilibrium,
active matter challenges these defining characteristics of thermodynamic
equilibrium. Although time irreversibility, fluxes, and extractable work have
been observed separately in various non-equilibrium systems, a comprehensive
understanding of these quantities and their interrelationship in the context of
living matter remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and
theory, we study the correlation between these three quantities in a single
system consisting of swimming Escherichia coli navigating through funnel-shaped
obstacles. We show that the interplay between geometric constraints and
bacterial swimming breaks time-reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of
local mass fluxes. Using an harmonically trapped colloid coupled weakly to
bacterial motion, we demonstrate that the amount of extractable work depends on
the deviation from equilibrium as quantified by fluxes and entropy production.
We propose a minimal mechanical model and a generalized mass transfer relation
for bacterial rectification that quantitatively explains experimental
observations. Our study provides a microscopic understanding of bacterial
rectification and uncovers the intrinsic relation between time irreversibility,
fluxes, and extractable work in living systems far from equilibrium.

This paper studies the fusogenicity of cationic liposomes in relation to
their surface distribution of cationic lipids and utilizes membrane phase
separation to control this surface distribution. It is found that concentrating
the cationic lipids into small surface patches on liposomes, through
phase-separation, can enhance liposome's fusogenicity. Further concentrating
these lipids into smaller patches on the surface of liposomes led to an
increased level of fusogenicity. These experimental findings are supported by
numerical simulations using a mathematical model for phase-separated charged
liposomes. Findings of this study may be used for design and development of
highly fusogenic liposomes with minimal level of toxicity.

It is shown micromagnetic and atomistic spin dynamics simulations can use
multiple GPUs in order to reduce computation time, but also to allow for a
larger simulation size than is possible on a single GPU. Whilst interactions
which depend on neighbouring spins, such as exchange interactions, may be
implemented efficiently by transferring data between GPUs using halo regions,
or alternatively using direct memory accesses, implementing the long-range
demagnetizing interaction is the main difficulty in achieving good performance
scaling, where the data transfer rate between GPUs is a significant bottleneck.
A multi-GPU convolution algorithm is developed here, which relies on single-GPU
FFTs executed in parallel. It is shown that even for micromagnetic simulations
where the demagnetizing interaction computation time dominates, good
performance scaling may be achieved, with speedup factors up to 1.8, 2.5, and
3.1, for 2, 3, and 4 GPUs respectively. The code developed here can be used for
any number of GPUs in parallel, with performance scaling strongly dependent on
inter-GPU data transfer rate and connection topology. This is further improved
in micromagnetic simulations which include a spin transport solver, obtaining
speedup factors up to 1.96, 2.8, and 3.7, for 2, 3, and 4 GPUs respectively.
The best case scenario is obtained for atomistic spin dynamics simulations,
where the demagnetizing interaction is implemented with spin-averaged cells.
Using a single workstation with 4 GPUs, it is shown atomistic spin dynamics
simulations with up to 1 billion spins, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations
with up to 2 billion spins are possible, with a near-ideal performance scaling.

The recent claimed room-temperature superconductivity in Cu-doped lead
apatite at ambient pressure are under highly debate. To identify its physical
origin, we studied the crystal structures, energy band structures, lattice
dynamics and magnetic properties of the parent Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O compound,
in which two different phases of the LK-99 compound are analyzed in detail. Our
results show that the Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O compound is an indirect band gap
semiconductor, where Cu doping at the 4$f$ site of Pb leads to a semiconducting
to half-metallic transition. Two half-filled flat bands spanning the Fermi
energy levels are present in the 4$f$-phase of LK-99, which are mainly formed
by hybridization of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{zy}$ orbitals of Cu with the 2$p$
orbitals of O. In addition, 6$h$-phase of LK-99 always has spin polarity at the
bottom of the conduction band and at the top of the valence band, making the
material a bipolar magnetic semiconductor. Our results are basically consistent
with the recent experimental transport properties of LK-99 posted on
arXiv:2308.05778.

In this comment on "Origin of correlated isolated flat bands in
copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite" (arXiv:2307.16892
[cond-mat.supr-con]), we discuss the flat half-occupied two-band manifold that
appears in $\mathrm{Pb}_9\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{PO}_4)_6(\mathrm{OH})_2$ when
using a semilocal DFT functional. We argue that the flat band is an artifact of
the functional's overestimation of the energy of the oxygen p states in the
valence band. When using the HSE hybrid functional, the energy of the oxygen p
states is reduced, and the copper-derived manifold splits into one fully
occupied and one empty band. While these results do not rule out the
possibility of superconductivity in doped LK-99, they do predict that
stoichiometric $\mathrm{Pb}_9\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{PO}_4)_6(\mathrm{OH})_2$ is an
insulator, not a superconductor. Furthermore, we have shown that future
first-principles studies of these materials should employ hybrid functionals or
other advanced methods to ensure that the oxygen-derived valence-band energies
are correctly described.

Soft magnetic dots in the form of thin rings have unique topological
properties. They can be in a vortex state with no vortex core. Here, we study
the magnon modes of such systems both analytically and numerically. In an
external magnetic field, magnetic rings are characterized by easy-cone
magnetization and shows a giant splitting of doublets for modes with the
opposite value of the azimuthal mode quantum number. The effect of the
splitting can be refereed as a magnon analog of the topology-induced
Aharonov-Bohm effect. For this we develop an analytical theory to describe the
non-monotonic dependence of the mode frequencies on the azimuthal mode number,
influenced by the balance between the local exchange and non-local dipole
interactions.

<h3>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</h3>

Atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focuses on
temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the difficulty in computing the free
energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested
sampling (NS) algorithm allows modeling surface phase equilibria at arbitrary
temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function,
whose relationship with free energy is well known. In this work, we extend NS
to calculate surface phase diagrams, including all relevant translational,
rotational, and vibrational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to
the surfaces of the Lennard-Jones solid, recording energies through the
iterative compression of surface phase space rather than a specific cooling
schedule. We construct the partition function from these recorded energies to
calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the
constant-volume heat capacity and temperature-dependent order parameters that
characterize the surface structure. Key results include determining the nature
of phase transitions on flat and stepped surfaces, which typically feature an
enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven
reordering process at lower temperatures, and the presence of critical points
on the phase diagrams of most of the flatter facets. Overall, we demonstrate
the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling and, ultimately, materials
discovery.

Weak topological insulators, constructed by stacking quantum spin Hall
insulators with weak interlayer coupling, offer promising quantum electronic
applications through topologically nontrivial edge channels. However, the
currently available weak topological insulators are stacks of the same quantum
spin Hall layer with translational symmetry in the out-of-plane direction,
leading to the absence of the channel degree of freedom for edge states. Here,
we study a candidate weak topological insulator, Bi4Br2I2, which is alternately
stacked by three different quantum spin Hall insulators, each with tunable
topologically non-trivial edge states. Our angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and first-principles calculations show that an energy gap opens at
the crossing points of different Dirac cones correlated with different layers
due to the interlayer interaction. This is essential to achieve the tunability
of topological edge states as controlled by varying the chemical potential. Our
work offers a perspective for the construction of tunable quantized conductance
devices for future spintronic applications.

<h3>Ab-initio Insights on the Fermiology of $d^1$ Transition metals in  Honeycomb lattice : Hierarchy of hopping pathways and spin-orbit coupling</h3>

Motivated by the intriguing suggestion of realizing SU(8) Dirac semi-metal
with $J=3/2$ electrons on a honeycomb lattice, we provide a systematic study of
the interplay of various hopping pathways and atomic spin-orbit coupling for
the low energy electrons in candidate d$^1$ transition metal halides MX$_3$
(M=Ti, Zr, Hf; X=F, Cl, Br). By combining first principle calculations and
minimal hopping Hamiltonian, we uncover the role of dominant direct metal-metal
hopping on top of indirect metal-halide-metal hopping. This sets up a hierarchy
of hopping pathways that centrally modify the SU(8) picture for the above
materials. These hopping interactions, along with the spin-orbit coupling, lead
to a plethora of exactly compensated metals instead of the SU(8) Dirac
semi-metal. Remarkably the same can be understood as descendants of a
topological insulator obtained by gapping out the SU(8) Dirac semi-metallic
phase. The resultant compensated metals have varied Fermi surface topology and
are separated by Lifshitz phase transitions. We discuss the implications of the
proximate Lifshitz transition, which may be accessed via strain, in the context
of the relevant materials.

<h3>Theory of Capillary Tension and Interfacial Dynamics of Motility-Induced  Phases</h3>

The statistical mechanics of equilibrium interfaces has been well-established
for over a half century. In the last decade, a wealth of observations have made
increasingly clear that a new perspective is required to describe interfaces
arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In this Letter, beginning from microscopic
particle dynamics that break time-reversal symmetry, we systematically derive
the interfacial dynamics of coexisting motility-induced phases. Doing so allows
us to identify the athermal energy scale that excites interfacial fluctuations
and the nonequilibrium surface tension that resists these excitations. In
addition to establishing an active capillary-wave theory, our theory identifies
that, in contrast to equilibrium fluids, this active surface tension contains
contributions arising from nonconservative forces which act to suppress
interfacial fluctuations. The identified contribution bares a remarkable
resemblance with that envisioned by Edwards and Wilkinson in their description
of the surface of athermal granular materials, suggesting that
dynamically-stabilized interfaces may be a phenomenon common to a wide class of
nonequilibrium systems.
