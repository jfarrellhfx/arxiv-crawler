<h3>Real-space imaging of polar and elastic nano-textures in thin films via  inversion of diffraction data</h3>

Exploiting the emerging nanoscale periodicities in epitaxial, single-crystal
thin films is an exciting direction in quantum materials science: confinement
and periodic distortions induce novel properties. The structural motifs of
interest are ferroelastic, ferroelectric, multiferroic, and, more recently,
topologically protected magnetization and polarization textures. A critical
step towards heterostructure engineering is understanding their nanoscale
structure, best achieved through real-space imaging. X-ray Bragg coherent
diffractive imaging visualizes sub-picometer crystalline displacements with
tens of nanometers spatial resolution. Yet, it is limited to objects spatially
confined in all three dimensions and requires highly coherent, laser-like
x-rays. Here we lift the confinement restriction by developing real-space
imaging of periodic lattice distortions: we combine an iterative phase
retrieval algorithm with unsupervised machine learning to invert the diffuse
scattering in conventional x-ray reciprocal-space mapping into real-space
images of polar and elastic textures in thin epitaxial films. We first
demonstrate our imaging in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices to be consistent with
published phase-field model calculations. We then visualize strain-induced
ferroelastic domains emerging during the metal-insulator transition in Ca2RuO4
thin films. Instead of homogeneously transforming into a low-temperature
structure (like in bulk), the strained Mott insulator splits into nanodomains
with alternating lattice constants, as confirmed by cryogenic scanning
transmission electron microscopy. Our study reveals the type, size,
orientation, and crystal displacement field of the nano-textures. The
non-destructive imaging of textures promises to improve models for their
dynamics and enable advances in quantum materials and microelectronics.

<h3>Data-based Polymer-Unit Fingerprint (PUFp): A Newly Accessible  Expression of Polymer Organic Semiconductors for Machine Learning</h3>

In the process of finding high-performance organic semiconductors (OSCs), it
is of paramount importance in material development to identify important
functional units that play key roles in material performance and subsequently
establish substructure-property relationships. Herein, we describe a
polymer-unit fingerprint (PUFp) generation framework. Machine learning (ML)
models can be used to determine structure-mobility relationships by using PUFp
information as structural input with 678 pieces of collected OSC data. A
polymer-unit library consisting of 445 units is constructed, and the key
polymer units for the mobility of OSCs are identified. By investigating the
combinations of polymer units with mobility performance, a scheme for designing
polymer OSC materials by combining ML approaches and PUFp information is
proposed to not only passively predict OSC mobility but also actively provide
structural guidance for new high-mobility OSC material design. The proposed
scheme demonstrates the ability to screen new materials through pre-evaluation
and classification ML steps and is an alternative methodology for applying ML
in new high-mobility OSC discovery.

<h3>Accelerating the Discovery of g-C$_3$N$_4$-Supported Single Atom  Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: A Combined DFT and Machine  Learning Strategy</h3>

Two-dimensional materials supported by single atom catalysis (SACs) are
foreseen to replace platinum for large-scale industrial scalability of
sustainable hydrogen generation. Here, a series of metal (Al, Sc, Ti, V, Cr,
Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) and non-metal (B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl) single atoms
embedded on various active sites of g-C$_3$N$_4$ are screened by DFT
calculations and six machine learning (ML) algorithms (support vector
regression, gradient boosting regression, random forest regression, AdaBoost
regression, multilayer perceptron regression, ridge regression). Our results
based on formation energy, Gibbs free energy and bandgap analysis demonstrate
that the single atoms of B, Mn and Co anchored on g-C$_3$N$_4$ can serve as
highly efficient active sites for hydrogen production. The ML model based on
support vector regression (SVR) exhibits the best performance to accurately and
rapidly predict the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (${\Delta}$GH )
for the test set with a lower mean absolute error (MAE) and a high coefficient
of determination (R$^2$) of 0.45 and 0.81, respectively. Feature selection
based on the SVR model highlights the top five primary features: formation
energy, bond length, boiling point, melting point, and valance electron as key
descriptors. Overall, the multistep work-flow employed through DFT calculations
combined with ML models for efficient screening of potential hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) from g-C$_3$N$_4$-based single atom catalysis can significantly
contribute to the catalyst design and fabrication.

<h3>Generalized topological bulk-edge correspondence in continuous systems  with non-Hermitian boundary conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01685</a>

<i>Orr Rapoport, Moshe Goldstein</i>
<br>
<br>
The bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) is the hallmark of topological systems. In
continuous (non-lattice) Hermitian systems with unbounded wavevector it was
recently shown that the BEC is modified. How would it be further affected in
non-Hermitian systems, experiencing loss and/or gain? In this work we take the
first step in this direction, by studying a Hermitian continuous system with
non-Hermitian boundary conditions. We find in this case that edge modes emerge
at roots of the scattering matrix, as opposed to the Hermitian case, where they
emerge at poles (or, more accurately, coalescence of roots and poles). This
entails a nontrivial modification to the relative Levinson's theorem. We then
show that the topological structure remains the same as in the Hermitian case,
and the generalized BEC holds, provided one employs appropriate modified
contours in the wavevector plane, so that the scattering matrix phase winding
counts the edge modes correctly. We exemplify all this using a paradigmatic
model of waves in a shallow ocean or active systems in the presence of odd
viscosity, as well as 2D electron gas with Hall viscosity. We use this
opportunity to examine the case of large odd viscosity, where the scattering
matrix becomes $2\times2$, which has not been discussed in previous works on
the Hermitian generalized BEC.

<h3>Higgs Condensates are Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases: I. Discrete  Symmetries</h3>

Where in the landscape of many-body phases of matter do we place the Higgs
condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has
no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically
connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as
superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal
description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase,
utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus
on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected
by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends
on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs
phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has
SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm
analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust
upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined
phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a
boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations.
More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the
emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation
between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase
can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs
condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT
phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge
group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The
sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries,
interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.

<h3>Large-Scale $2+1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ Gauge Theory with Dynamical Matter in  a Cold-Atom Quantum Simulator</h3>

A major driver of quantum-simulator technology is the prospect of probing
high-energy phenomena in synthetic quantum matter setups at a high level of
control and tunability, thereby offering a venue complementary to dedicated
particle colliders. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible realization of
a large-scale $2+1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge theory with dynamical matter and
gauge fields in a cold-atom quantum simulator with spinless bosons. We present
the full mapping of the corresponding Gauss's law onto the bosonic
computational basis. We then show that the target gauge theory can be
faithfully realized and stabilized by an emergent gauge protection term in a
two-dimensional single-species Bose--Hubbard optical Lieb superlattice with two
spatial periods along either direction, thereby requiring only moderate
experimental resources already available in current cold-atom setups. Using
infinite matrix product states, we calculate numerical benchmarks for adiabatic
sweeps and global quench dynamics that further confirm the fidelity of the
mapping. Our work brings quantum simulators of gauge theories a significant
step forward in terms of investigating particle physics in higher spatial
dimensions, and is readily implementable in existing cold-atom platforms.

<h3>Quantum Spin Puddles and Lakes: NISQ-Era Spin Liquids from  Non-Equilibrium Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01381" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01381</a>

While many-body systems can host long-ranged entangled quantum spin liquids
(QSLs), the ingredients for realizing these as ground states can be
prohibitively difficult. In many circumstances, one requires (i) a constrained
Hilbert space and (ii) an extensive quantum superposition. The paradigmatic
example is the toric code, or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which is a
superposition of closed loop states. We show how non-equilibrium Hamiltonian
dynamics can provide a streamlined route toward creating such QSLs. Rather than
cooling into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, we show how a simple parameter
sweep can dynamically project a family of initial product states into the
constrained space, giving rise to a QSL. For the toric code, this is achieved
in systems with a separation in energy scales between the $e$- and $m$-anyons,
where one can sweep in a way that is adiabatic (sudden) with respect to the
former (latter). Although this separation of scales does not extend to the
thermodynamic limit, we analytically and numerically show that this method
efficiently prepares a spin liquid in finite-sized regions, which we brand
``quantum spin lakes.'' This mechanism elucidates recent experimental and
numerical observations of the dynamical state preparation of the ruby lattice
spin liquid in Rydberg atom arrays. In fact, the slow dynamics of $m$-anyons
suggest that we can capture spin lake preparation by simulating the dynamics on
tree lattices, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. Finally, we
use this mechanism to propose new experiments, e.g., for preparing a
finite-sized $U(1)$ spin liquid as a honeycomb Rokhsar-Kivelson dimer model
using Rydberg atoms -- which is remarkable given its equilibrium counterpart is
unstable in $2 + 1$D. Our work opens up a new avenue in the study of
non-equilibrium physics, as well as the exploration of exotic states of finite
extent in NISQ devices.

<h3>Sublattice Interference promotes Pair Density Wave order in Kagome  Metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01388" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01388</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Ming Wu, Ronny Thomale, S. Raghu</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the observation of a pair density wave (PDW) in the kagome metal
CsV${}_3$Sb${}_5$, we consider the fate of electrons near a p-type van Hove
singularity (vHS) in the presence of local repulsive interactions. We study the
effect of such interactions on Fermi surface "patches" at the vHS. We show how
a feature unique to the Kagome lattice known as sublattice interference
crucially affects the form of the interactions among the patches. The RG flow
of such interactions results in a regime where nearest neighbor interactions
exceed onsite repulsion. We identify this condition as being favorable for the
formation of CDW and PDW orders. We conclude that in the weak-coupling limit,
CDW order is the dominant order, whereas PDW order sets in at intermediate
coupling.

<h3>Strange-metal behavior in a Fermi liquid with strange scatterers</h3>

<br>
<br>
A variety of low-temperature, normal-state properties of optimally and
overdoped cuprate superconductors, including the DC and optical transport
responses, are sufficiently anomalous that they might seem to be inconsistent
with any quasiparticle description. However, we show by explicit construction
that the most salient phenomena can be accounted for in a system with localized
"strange scatterers" embedded into a Fermi liquid with a conventional
quasiparticle description. Such scatterers could originate from "two-level
systems" associated with an electronic glassy state with short-range
charge-order correlations.

<h3>Improved effective vertices in the multi-orbital Two-Particle  Self-Consistent method from Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01400</a>
<br>
<i>Karim Zantout, Steffen Backes, Aleksandar Razpopov, Dominik Lessnich, Roser Valenti</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we present a multi-orbital form of the Two-Particle
Self-Consistent approach (TPSC), here the effective local and static
irreducible interaction vertices are determined by means of the Dynamical
Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). This approach replaces the approximate ansatz
equations for the double occupations $\langle
n^{}_{\alpha,\sigma}n^{}_{\beta,\sigma'}\rangle$ by sampling them directly for
the same model using DMFT. Compared to the usual Hartree-Fock like ansatz, this
leads to more accurate local vertices in the weakly correlated regime, and
provides access to stronger correlated systems that were previously out of
reach. This approach is extended by replacing the local component of the TPSC
self-energy by the DMFT impurity self-energy, which results in an improved
self-energy that incorporates strong local correlations but retains a
non-trivial momentum-dependence. We find that this combination of TPSC and DMFT
provides a significant improvement over the multi-orbital formulation of
multi-orbital TPSC, as it allows to determine the components of the spin vertex
without artificial symmetry assumptions, and opens the possibility to include
the transversal particle-hole channel. The new approach is also able to remove
unphysical divergences in the charge vertices in TPSC. We find a general trend
that lower temperatures can be accessed in the calculation. Benchmarking
single-particle quantities such as the local spectral function with other
many-body methods we find significant improvement in the more strongly
correlated regime.

We report energy renormalizations from electron-phonon and electron-magnon
interactions in spin minority surface resonances on Ni(111). The different
interactions are disentangled and quantified in strength $\lambda$, based on
the characteristic shapes of their complex self-energies, and the largely
different binding energies at which they occur. The observed electron-magnon
interactions reveal a strong dependence on momentum and energy band position in
the bulk Brillouin zone. In contrast, electron-phonon interactions from the
same bands are observed to be practically momentum- and symmetry-independent.
Additionally, a moderately strong ($\lambda>0.5$) electron-phonon interaction
is observed from a `buried', near-parabolic spin majority band that does not
cross the Fermi level.

<h3>Generation and propagation of solitary waves in nematic liquid crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01453" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01453</a>

<br>
<br>
Solitons in nematic liquid crystals offer intriguing opportunities for
transport and sensing in microfluidic systems. Little is known about the
elementary conditions that are needed to create solitons in nematic materials.
In this work, theory, simulations and experiments are used to study the
generation and propagation of solitary waves (or "solitons") in nematic liquid
crystals upon the application of an alternating current (AC) electric field. We
find that these solitary waves exhibit "butterfly"-like or "bullet"-like
structures that travel in the direction perpendicular to the applied electric
field. Such structures propagate over long distances without losing their
initial shape. The theoretical model adopted here serves to identify some of
the key requirements that are needed to generate solitons in the absence of
electrostatic interactions. These include surface imperfections that introduce
a twist in the director, unequal elastic constants, and negative anisotropic
dielectric permittivity. The results of simulations are shown to be in good
agreement with our own experimental observations, serving to establish the
validity of the theoretical concepts advanced in this work.

<h3>Unravelling the origin of the peculiar transition in the magnetically  ordered phase of the Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01483</a>
<br>
<i>Ivica Zivkovic, Ravi Yadav, Jian-Rui Soh, ChangJiang Yi, YouGuo Shi, Oleg V. Yazyev, Henrik M. Ronnow</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent discovery of topologically non-trivial behavior in Co3Sn2S2 stimulated
a notable interest in this itinerant ferromagnet (Tc = 174 K). The exact
magnetic state remains ambiguous, with several reports indicating the existence
of a second transition in the range 125 -- 130 K, with antiferromagnetic and
glassy phases proposed to coexist with the ferromagnetic phase. Using detailed
angle-dependent DC and AC magnetization measurements on large, high-quality
single crystals we reveal a highly anisotropic behavior of both static and
dynamic response of Co3Sn2S2. It is established that many observations related
to sharp magnetization changes when B || c are influenced by the
demagnetization factor of a sample. On the other hand, a genuine transition has
been found at Tp = 128 K, with the magnetic response being strictly
perpendicular to the c-axis and several orders of magnitude smaller than for B
|| c. Calculations using density-functional theory indicate that the ground
state magnetic structure consist of magnetic moments canted away from the
c-axis by a small angle (~ 1.5deg). We argue that the second transition
originates from a small additional canting of moments within the kagome plane,
with two equivalent orientations for each spin.

<br>
<br>
The statistical properties of physical systems in thermal equilibrium are
blatantly different from their far-from-equilibrium counterparts. In the
latter, fluctuations often dominate the dynamics and might cluster in ordered
patterns in the form of dissipative coherent structures. Here, we study the
transition of a cold atomic cloud, driven close to a sharp electronic
resonance, from a stable to a turbulent phase. From the atomic density
distribution -- measured using a spatially-resolved pump-probe technique -- we
have computed the Shannon entropy on two different basis sets. Information
compression, corresponding to a minimum in the Shannon entropy, has been
observed at criticality, where the system fluctuations organize into high-order
(low-entropy) patterns. Being independent of the representation used, this
feature is a property shared by a vast class of physical systems undergoing
phase transitions.

The capabilities of image probe experiments are rapidly expanding, providing
new information about quantum materials on unprecedented length and time
scales. Many such materials feature inhomogeneous electronic properties with
intricate pattern formation on the observable surface. This rich spatial
structure contains information about interactions, dimensionality, and disorder
-- a spatial encoding of the Hamiltonian driving the pattern formation. Image
recognition techniques from machine learning are an excellent tool for
interpreting information encoded in the spatial relationships in such images.
Here, we develop a deep learning framework for using the rich information
available in these spatial correlations in order to discover the underlying
Hamiltonian driving the patterns. We first vet the method on a known case,
scanning near-field optical microscopy on a thin film of VO2. We then apply our
trained convolutional neural network architecture to new optical microscope
images of a different VO2 film as it goes through the metal-insulator
transition. We find that a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with both interactions
and random field disorder is required to explain the intricate, fractal
intertwining of metal and insulator domains during the transition. This
detailed knowledge about the underlying Hamiltonian paves the way to using the
model to control the pattern formation via, e.g., tailored hysteresis
protocols. We also introduce a distribution-based confidence measure on the
results of a multi-label classifier, which does not rely on adversarial
training. In addition, we propose a new machine learning based criterion for
diagnosing a physical system's proximity to criticality.

<br>
<br>
We present the growth and basic magnetic and transport properties of
Cr$_{1+x}$Pt$_{5-x}$P. We show that single crystals can readily be grown from a
high-temperature solution created by adding dilute quantities of Cr to Pt-P
based melts. Like other 1-5-1 compounds, Cr$_{1+x}$Pt$_{5-x}$P adopts a
tetragonal P4/mmm structure composed face-sharing CrPt$_3$ like slabs that are
broken up along the c-axis by sheets of P atoms. EDS and X-ray diffraction
measurements both suggest Cr$_{1+x}$Pt$_{5-x}$P has mixed occupancy between Cr
and Pt atoms, similar to what is found in the closely related compound
CrPt$_3$, giving real compositions of Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P (x = 0.5). We
report that Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P orders ferromagnetically at T$_C$ = 464.5 K
with a saturated moment of $\approx$ 2.1 $\mu_{\textit{B}}$/Cr at 1.8 K. Likely
owing to the strong spin-orbit coupling associated with the large quantity of
high Z Pt atoms, Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P has exceptionally strong planar
anisotropy with estimated anisotropy fields of 345 kOe and 220 kOe at 1.8 K and
300 K respectively. The resistance of Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P has a metallic
temperature dependence with relatively weak magnetoresistance. Electronic band
structure calculations show that CrPt$_5$P has a large peak in the density of
states near the Fermi level which is split into spin majority and minority
bands in the ferromagnetic state. Furthermore, the calculations suggest
substantial hybridization between Cr-3d and Pt-5d states near the Fermi level,
in agreement with the experimentally measured anisotropy.

<br>
<br>
Elemental tellurium is a strongly spin-orbit coupled Peierls-distorted
semiconductor whose band structure features topologically protected Weyl nodes.
Using time-dependent density functional theory calculations, we show that
impulsive optical excitation can be used to transiently control the amplitude
of the Peierls distortion, realizing a mechanism to switch tellurium between
three states: Weyl semiconductor, Weyl metal and non-Weyl metal. Further, we
present experimental evidence of this inverse-Peierls distortion using
time-resolved optical second harmonic generation measurements. These results
provide a pathway to multifunctional ultrafast Weyl devices and introduce
Peierls systems as viable hosts of light-induced topological transitions.

We study the organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) performance of the
ladder polymer, poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) in an attempt to
better understand how an apparently hydrophobic side-chain-free polymer is able
to operate as an OECT with favorable redox kinetics in an aqueous environment.
We examine two BBLs of different molecular masses from different sources. Both
BBLs show significant film swelling during the initial reduction step. By
combining electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (eQCM) gravimetry,
in-operando atomic force microscopy (AFM), and both ex-situ and in-operando
grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS), we provide a detailed
structural picture of the electrochemical charge injection process in BBL in
the absence of any hydrophilic side-chains. Compared with ex-situ measurements,
in-operando GIWAXS shows both more swelling upon electrochemical doping than
has previously been recognized, and less contraction upon dedoping. The data
show that BBL films undergo an irreversible hydration driven by the initial
electrochemical doping cycle with significant water retention and lamellar
expansion that persists across subsequent oxidation/reduction cycles. This
swelling creates a hydrophilic environment that facilitates the subsequent fast
hydrated ion transport in the absence of the hydrophilic side-chains used in
many other polymer systems. Due to its rigid ladder backbone and absence of
hydrophilic side-chains, the primary BBL water uptake does not significantly
degrade the crystalline order, and the original dehydrated, unswelled state can
be recovered after drying. The combination of doping induced hydrophilicity and
robust crystalline order leads to efficient ionic transport and good stability.

Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) based on insertion electrodes reach intrinsic
capacity limits. Performance improvements and cost reduction require
alternative reaction mechanisms and novel battery chemistries such as
conversion reactions and sodium-ion batteries (NaBs), respectively. We here
study the formation of Ti1-xVxH2 hydrides (0 < x < 1) and their electrochemical
properties as anodes in LiBs and NaBs half-cells. Hydrides were synthesized by
mechanochemistry of the metal powders under hydrogen atmosphere (PH2~ 8 MPa).
For V contents below 80 at.% (x < 0.8), single-phase pseudobinary dihydride
compounds Ti1-xVxH2 are formed. They crystallize in the fluorite-type structure
and are highly nanostructured (crystallite size < 10 nm). Their lattice
parameter decreases linearly with the V content leading to hydride
destabilization. Electrochemical studies were first carried out in Li-ion half
cells with full conversion between Ti1-xVxH2 hydrides and lithium. The
potential of the conversion reaction can be gradually tuned with the vanadium
content due to its destabilization effect. Furthermore, different paths for the
conversion reaction are observed for Ti-rich (x < 0.25) and V-rich (x > 0.7)
alloys. Na-ion half-cell measurements prove the reactivity between (V,Ti)H2
hydrides and sodium, albeit with significant kinetic limitations

Conventionally the mobility edge (ME) separating extended states from
localized ones is a central concept in understanding Anderson localization
transition. The critical state, being delocalized and non-ergodic, is a third
type of fundamental state that is different from both the extended and
localized states. Here we study the localization phenomena in a one dimensional
periodically kicked quasiperiodic optical Raman lattice by using fractal
dimensions. We show a rich phase diagram including the pure extended, critical
and localized phases in the high frequency regime, the MEs separating the
critical regions from the extended (localized) regions, and the coexisting
phase of extended, critical and localized regions with increasing the kicked
period. We also find the fragility of phase boundaries, which are more
susceptible to the dynamical kick, and the phenomenon of the reentrant
localization transition. Finally, we demonstrate how the studied model can be
realized based on current cold atom experiments and how to detect the rich
physics by the expansion dynamics. Our results provide insight into studying
and detecting the novel critical phases, MEs, coexisting quantum phases, and
some other physics phenomena in the periodically kicked systems.

Like many quantum fluids, superfluid helium-4 (He II) can be considered as a
mixture of two miscible fluid components: an inviscid superfluid and a viscous
normal fluid consisting of thermal quasiparticles [1]. A mutual friction
between the two fluids can emerge due to quasiparticles scattering off
quantized vortex lines in the superfluid [2]. This quantum dissipation
mechanism is the key for understanding various fascinating behaviors of the
two-fluid system [3,4]. However, due to the lack of experimental data for
guidance, modeling the mutual friction between individual vortices and the
normal fluid remains an unsettled topic despite decades of research [5-10].
Here we report an experiment where we visualize the motion of quantized vortex
rings in He II by decorating them with solidified deuterium tracer particles.
By examining how the rings spontaneously shrink and accelerate, we provide
unequivocal evidences showing that only a recent theory [9] which accounts for
the coupled motion of the two fluids with a self-consistent local friction can
reproduce the observed ring dynamics. Our work eliminates long-standing
ambiguities in our theoretical description of the vortex dynamics in He II,
which will have a far-reaching impact since similar mutual friction concept has
been adopted for a wide variety of quantum two-fluid systems, including atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) [11,12], superfluid neutron stars [13-15], and
gravity-mapped holographic superfluid [16,17].

<h3>Cooperative Motions and Topology-Driven Dynamical Arrest in Prime Knots</h3>

Knots are entangled structures that cannot be untangled without a cut.
Topological stability of knots is one of the many examples of their important
properties that can be used in information storage and transfer. Knot dynamics
is important for understanding general principles of entanglement as knots
provide an isolated system where tangles are highly controlled and easily
manipulated. To unravel the dynamics of these entangled topological objects,
the first step is to identify the dominant motions that are uniquely guided by
knot structure and its complexity. We identify and classify motions into three
main groups -- orthogonal, aligned, and mixed motions, which often act in
unison, orchestrating the complex dynamics of knots. The balance between these
motions is what creates an identifiable signature for every knot. As knot
complexity increases, the carefully orchestrated dynamics is gradually
silenced, eventually reaching a state of topologically driven dynamical arrest.
Depending on their complexity, knots undergo a transition from nearly
stochastic motions to either non-random or even quasiperiodic dynamics before
culminating in dynamical arrest. Here, we show for the first time that
connectivity alone can lead to a topology-driven dynamical arrest in knots of
high complexity. Unexpectedly, we noticed that some knots undergo cooperative
motions as they reach higher complexity, uniquely modulating conformational
patterns of a given knot. Together, these findings demonstrate a link between
topology and dynamics, presenting applications to nanoscale materials.

Van der Waals (vdW) Josephson junctions can possibly accelerate the
development of advanced superconducting device that utilizes the unique
properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
superconductors such as spin-orbit coupling, spin-valley locking. Here, we
fabricate vertically stacked NbS$_{2}$/NbS$_{2}$ Josephson junctions using a
modified all-dry transfer technique and characterize the device performance via
systematic low-temperature transport measurements. The experimental results
show that the superconducting transition temperature of the NbS$_{2}$/NbS$_{2}$
Josephson junction is 5.84 K, and the critical current density reaches 3975
A/cm$^{2}$ at 2K. Moreover, we extract a superconducting energy gap
$\Delta=0.58$ meV, which is considerably smaller than that expected from the
single band s-wave Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model ($\Delta=0.89$ meV).

Within recent years, the field of nano-mechanics has diversified in a variety
of applications, ranging from quantum information processing to biological
molecules recognition. Among the diversity of devices produced these days, the
simplest (but versatile) element remains the doubly-clamped beam: it can store
very large tensile stresses (producing high resonance frequencies $f_0$ and
quality factors $Q$), is interfaceable with electric setups (by means of
conductive layers), and can be produced easily in clean rooms (with scalable
designs including multiplexing). Besides, its mechanical properties are the
simplest to describe. Resonance frequencies and $Q$s are being modeled, with as
specific achievement the ultra-high quality resonances based on ``soft
clamping'' and ``phonon shields''. Here, we demonstrate that the fabrication
undercut of the clamping regions of basic nano-beams produces a ``natural soft
clamping'', given for free. We present the analytic theory that enables to fit
experimental data, which can be used for $\{ Q , f_0 \}$ design.

We report a comprehensive study of the static susceptibility, high-field
magnetization and high-frequency/high-magnetic field electron spin resonance
(HF-ESR) spectroscopy of polycrystalline samples of the bismuth cobalt
oxy-phosphate BiCoPO$_5$. This compound features a peculiar spin system that
can be considered as antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains built of pairs of
ferromagnetically coupled Co spins and interconnected in all three spatial
directions. It was previously shown that BiCoPO$_5$ orders
antiferromagnetically at $T_{\rm N} \approx 10$ K and this order can be
continuously suppressed by magnetic field towards the critical value
$\mu_0H_{\rm c} \approx 15$ T. In our experiments we find strongly enhanced
magnetic moments and spectroscopic $g$ factors as compared to the expected
spin-only values, suggesting a strong contribution of orbital magnetism for the
Co$^{2+}$ ions. This is quantitatively confirmed by ab initio quantum chemical
calculations. Within the AFM ordered phase, we observe a distinct field-induced
magnetic phase transition. Its critical field rises to $\sim 6$ T at $T \ll
T_{\rm N}$. The HF-ESR spectra recorded at $T\ll T_{\rm N}$ are very rich
comprising up to six resonance modes possibly of the multimagnonic nature that
soften towards the critical region around 6 T. Interestingly, we find that the
Co moments are not yet fully polarized at $H_{\rm c}$ which supports a
theoretical proposal identifying $H_{\rm c}$ as the quantum critical point for
the transition of the spin system in BiCoPO$_5$ to the quantum disordered state
at stronger fields.

The realization of chiral Majorana modes is a challenging task. We aim to
comprehend the phase diagrams and parameter control capabilities of the actual
devices used in the chiral Majorana search. Beyond the well-known minimal
models, we develop a numerical simulation scheme using a self-consistent
Schrodinger-Poisson approach to study, as an example, the MnBi2Te4 thin film
coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We show that both the superconducting
proximity effect and the tunability of the chemical potential for the
topological surface states are significantly influenced by the gate-induced
electrostatic potential. This complicates the implementation in experiments,
and the actual topological region will be narrowed in stark contrast to those
predicted in the previous minimal models. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the
chiral Majorana mode still exists in a wide range of experimental parameters
with practical tunability.

We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the dynamic phase
transition properties of the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model on the kagome
lattice in the presence of square-wave oscillating magnetic field. Through
detailed finite-size scaling analysis, we study universality aspects of the
non-equilibrium phase transition. Obtained critical exponents indicate that the
two-dimensional kagome-lattice kinetic Ising model belongs to the same
universality class with the corresponding Ising model in equilibrium. Moreover,
dynamic critical exponent of the local moves used in simulations is determined
with high precision. Our numerical results are compatible with the previous
ones on kinetic Ising models.

<h3>Skyrmion Jellyfish in Driven Chiral Magnets</h3>

Chiral magnets can host topological particles known as skyrmions which carry
an exactly quantised topological charge $Q=-1$. In the presence of an
oscillating magnetic field ${\bf B}_1(t)$, a single skyrmion embedded in a
ferromagnetic background will start to move with constant velocity ${\bf
v}_{\text{trans}}$. The mechanism behind this motion is similar to the one used
by a jellyfish when it swims through water. We show that the skyrmion's motion
is a universal phenomenon, arising in any magnetic system with translational
modes. By projecting the equation of motion onto the skyrmion's translational
modes and going to quadratic order in ${\bf B}_1(t)$ we obtain an analytical
expression for ${\bf v}_{\text{trans}}$ as a function of the system's linear
response. The linear response and consequently ${\bf v}_{\text{trans}}$ are
influenced by the skyrmion's internal modes and scattering states, as well as
by the ferromagnetic background's Kittel mode. The direction and speed of ${\bf
v}_{\text{trans}}$ can be controlled by changing the polarisation, frequency
and phase of the driving field ${\bf B}_1(t)$. For systems with small Gilbert
damping parameter $\alpha$, we identify two distinct physical mechanisms used
by the skyrmion to move. At low driving frequencies, the skyrmion's motion is
driven by friction, and $v_{\text{trans}}\sim\alpha$, whereas at higher
frequencies above the ferromagnetic gap the skyrmion moves by magnon emission
and $v_{\text{trans}}$ becomes independent of $\alpha$.

<h3>Magnetism in Two-Dimensional Ilmenenes: Intrinsic Order and Strong  Anisotropy</h3>

Iron ilmenene is a new two-dimensional material that has recently been
exfoliated from the naturally-occurring iron titanate found in ilmenite ore, a
material that is abundant on earth surface. In this work, we theoretically
investigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of 2D
transition-metal-based ilmenene-like titanates. The study of magnetic order
reveals that these ilmenenes usually present intrinsic antiferromagnetic
coupling between the 3d magnetic metals decorating both sides of the Ti-O
layer. Furthermore, the ilmenenes based on late 3d brass metals, such as
CuTiO$_3$ and ZnTiO$_3$, become ferromagnetic and spin compensated,
respectively. Our calculations including spin-orbit coupling reveal that the
magnetic ilmenenes have large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies when the
3d shell departs from being either filled or half-filled, with their spin
orientation being out-of-plane for elements below half-filling of 3d states and
in-plane above. These interesting magnetic properties of ilmenenes make them
useful for future spintronic applications because they could be synthesized as
already realized in the iron case.

We present triple-axis neutron scattering studies of low-energy magnetic
fluctuations in strongly underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ with $x=0.05$,
$0.06$ and $0.07$, providing quantitative evidence for a direct competition
between these fluctuations and superconductivity. At dopings $x=0.06$ and
$x=0.07$, three-dimensional superconductivity is found, while only a very weak
signature of two-dimensional superconductivity residing in the CuO$_2$ planes
is detectable for $x=0.05$. We find a surprising suppression of the low-energy
fluctuations by an external magnetic field at all three dopings. This implies
that the response of two-dimensional superconductivity to a magnetic field is
similar to that of a bulk superconductor. Our results provide direct evidence
of a very gradual onset of superconductivity in cuprates.

Managing light-matter interaction on timescales faster than the loss of
electronic coherence is key for achieving the full quantum control of final
products in solid-solid transformations. In this work, we demonstrate coherent
electronic control of the photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition in the
prototypical Mott insulator V$_2$O$_3$. Selective excitation of a specific
interband transition with two phase-locked light pulses manipulates the orbital
occupation of the correlated bands in a way that depends on the coherent
evolution of the photoinduced superposition of states. Comparison between
experimental results and numerical solutions of the optical Bloch equations
provides an electronic coherence time on the order of 5 fs. Temperature
dependent experiments suggest that the electronic coherence time is enhanced in
the vicinity of the insulator-to-metal transition critical temperature, thus
highlighting the role of fluctuations in determining the electronic coherence.
These results open new routes to selectively switch functionalities of quantum
materials and coherently control solid-solid electronic transformations.

<h3>On the relation between disorder and homogeneity in an amorphous metal</h3>

Disorder and homogeneity are two concepts that refer to spatial variation of
the system potential. In condensed-matter systems disorder is typically divided
into two types; those with local parameters varying from site to site (diagonal
disorder) and those characterized by random transfer-integral values
(off-diagonal disorder). Amorphous systems in particular exhibit off-diagonal
disorder due to random positions of their constituents. In real systems
diagonal and off-diagonal disorder may be interconnected. The formal depiction
of disorder as local deviations from a common value focuses attention on the
short-range components of the potential-landscape. However, long range
potential fluctuation are quite common in real systems. In this work we seek to
find a correlation between disorder and homogeneity using amorphous
indium-oxide films with different carrier-concentrations and with different
degree of disorder. Thermal treatment is used as a means of fine tuning the
system disorder. In this process the resistance of the sample decreases while
its amorphous structure and chemical composition is preserved. The reduced
resistivity affects the Ioffe-Regel parameter that is taken as a relative
measure of disorder in a given sample. The homogeneity of the system was
monitored using inelastic light-scattering. This is based on collecting the
Raman signal from micron-size spots across the sample. The statistics of these
low-energy data are compared with the sample disorder independently estimated
from transport measurements. The analysis establishes that heterogeneity and
disorder are correlated.

Magneto-optic Kerr effect can probe the process of magnetization reversal in
ferromagnetic thin films and thus be used as an alternative to magnetometry.
Kerr effect is wavelength-dependent and the Kerr rotation can reverse sign,
vanishing at particular wavelengths. We investigate epitaxial heterostructures
of ferromagnetic manganite, La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$Mn$_{0.9}$Ru$_{0.1}$O$_3$, by
polar Kerr effect and magnetometry. The manganite layers are separated by or
interfaced with a layer of nickelate, NdNiO$_3$. Kerr rotation hysteresis loops
of trilayers, with two manganite layers of different thickness separated by a
nickelate layer, have intriguing humplike features, when measured with light of
400 nm wavelength. By investigating additional reference samples we disentangle
the contributions of the individual layers to the loops: we show that the humps
originate from the opposite sense of the Kerr rotation of the two different
ferromagnetic layers, combined with the additive behavior of the Kerr signal.

theory, a system composed of three layers of hexagonal Boron-Nitride(h-BN) in
all possible stackings. We obtain for each of the configurations how charge
transfers between the layers and how it impacts on the polarization of the
system. In addition, we studied a system of three layers, one of them rotated,
and we found that not only did the magnitude of the polarization increase
comparing with the bilayer but also, depending on the initial stacking and the
rotated layer, we can create a variety of mosaic-like polarization
arrangements, which are composed of regions with either triangular or hexagonal
symmetry.

<br>
In this brief review, we report some new development in the functional
determinant approach (FDA), an exact numerical method, in the studies of a
heavy quantum impurity immersed in Fermi gases and manipulated with
radio-frequency pulses. FDA has been successfully applied to investigate the
universal dynamical responses of a heavy impurity in an ultracold ideal Fermi
gas in both the time and frequency domain, which allows the exploration of the
renowned Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC). In such a system, OC is
induced by the multiple particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, which is
beyond a simple perturbation picture and manifests itself as the absence of
quasiparticles named polarons. More recently, two new directions for studying
heavy impurity with FDA have been developed. One is to extend FDA to a strongly
correlated background superfluid background, a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
superfluid. In this system, Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe is prohibited
due to the suppression of multiple particle-hole excitations by the superfluid
gap, which leads to the existence of genuine polaron. The other direction is to
generalize the FDA to the case of multiple RF pulses scheme, which extends the
well-established 1D Ramsey spectroscopy in ultracold atoms into
multidimensional, in the same spirit as the well-known multidimensional nuclear
magnetic resonance and optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy.
Multidimensional Ramsey spectroscopy allows us to investigate correlations
between spectral peaks of an impurity-medium system that is not accessible in
the conventional one-dimensional spectrum.

The competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity is one of
the central questions in the research of strong correlated systems. In this
work, we utilize a double layer model containing Hubbard interaction and
interlayer Heisenberg interaction to reveal their competitions. This model is
free of sign problem at certain conditions, and we perform projector quantum
Monte Carlo simulations to extract the ground state correlations of magnetism
and superconductivity. Our results shows that the superconductivity emerges
when the antiferromagnetism is suppressed by tuning the filling or the
anisotropy of the interlayer Heisenberg interaction. This model can be seen as
an analogue of unconventional superconductors and may help us to understand the
transition from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a superconductor.

We report on the interplay between a van Hove singularity and a charge
density wave state in 2H-TaSe$_{2}$. We use angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy to investigate changes in the Fermi surface of this material under
surface doping with potassium. At high doping, we observe modifications which
imply the disappearance of the $(3\times 3)$ charge density wave and formation
of a different correlated state. Using a tight-binding-based approach as well
as an effective model, we explain our observations as a consequence of coupling
between the single-particle Lifshitz transition during which the Fermi level
passes a van Hove singularity and the charge density order. The high electronic
density of states associated with the van Hove singularity induces a change in
the periodicity of the charge density wave from the known $(3\times 3)$ to a
new $(2\times 2)$ superlattice.

We report the growth and characterization of MnPd$_5$P, a ferromagnet with
T$_C$ $\approx$ 295 K, and conduct a substitutional study with its
antiferromagnetic analogue MnPt$_5$P. We grow single crystals of MnPd$_5$P and
Mn(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_5$P by adding Mn into (Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)-P based melts.
All compounds in the family adopt the layered anti-CeCoIn$_5$ structure with
space group P4/mmm, and EDS and XRD results indicate that MnPt$_5$P and
MnPd$_5$P form a solid solution. Based on magnetization and resistance data, we
construct a T-x phase diagram for Mn(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_5$P and demonstrate the
antiferromagnetic order found in MnPt$_5$P is extraordinarily sensitive to Pd
substitution. At low Pd fractions (x $<$ 0.010), the single antiferromagnetic
transition in pure MnPt$_5$P splits into a higher temperature ferromagnetic
transition followed on cooling by a lower temperature ferromagnetic to
antiferromagnetic transition and then by a re-entrant antiferromagnetic to
ferromagnetic transition at lower temperatures. The antiferromagnetic region
makes up a bubble that persists to x $\approx$ 0.009 for T $\approx$ 150 K,
with all samples x $<$ 0.009 recovering their initial ferromagnetic state with
further cooling to base temperature. Over the same low x range we find a
non-monotonic change in the room temperature unit cell volume, further
suggesting that pure MnPt$_5$P is close to an instability. Once x $>$ 0.010,
Mn(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_5$P undergoes a single ferromagnetic transition. The
Curie temperature increases rapidly with x, rising from T$_C$ $\approx$ 197 K
at x = 0.013 to a maximum of T$_C$ $\approx$ 312 K for x $\approx$ 0.62, and
then falls back to T$_C$ $\approx$ 295 K for pure MnPd$_5$P (x = 1). Given that
Pt and Pd are isoelectronic, this work raises questions as to the origin of the
extreme sensitivity of the magnetic ground state in MnPt$_5$P upon introducing
Pd.

Strongly correlated quantum particles in lattice potentials are the building
blocks for a large variety of quantum insulators, for instance Mott phases and
density waves breaking the lattice symmetry. Such collective states are
accessible to bosonic and fermionic systems. To expand further the spectrum of
accessible quantum matter phases, mixing both species is theoretically
appealing, since density order then competes with phase separation. Here we
manipulate such Bose-Fermi mixture by confining neutral (boson-like) and
charged (fermion-like) dipolar excitons in an artificial square lattice of a
GaAs bilayer. At unitary lattice filling, strong inter- and intra-species
interactions stabilise insulating phases when the fraction of charged excitons
is around (1/3, 1/2, 2/3). We evidence that dual Bose-Fermi density waves are
then realised, with species ordered in alternating stripes. Our observations
highlight that dipolar excitons allow for controlled implementations of
Bose-Fermi Hubbard models extended by off-site interactions.

The state of many physical, biological and socio-technical systems evolves by
combining smooth local transitions and abrupt resetting events to a set of
reference values. The inclusion of the resetting mechanism not only provides
the possibility of modeling a wide variety of realistic systems but also leads
to interesting novel phenomenology not present in reset-free cases. However,
most models where stochastic resetting is studied address the case of a finite
number of uncorrelated variables, commonly a single one, such as the position
of non-interacting random walkers. Here we overcome this limitation by framing
the process of network growth with node deletion as a stochastic resetting
problem where an arbitrarily large number of degrees of freedom are coupled and
influence each other, both in the resetting and non-resetting (growth) events.
We find the exact, full-time solution of the model, and several
out-of-equilibrium properties are characterized as function of the growth and
resetting rates, such as the emergence of a time-dependent percolation-like
phase transition, and first-passage statistics. Coupled multiparticle systems
subjected to resetting are a necessary generalization in the theory of
stochastic resetting, and the model presented herein serves as an illustrative,
natural and solvable example of such a generalization.

<br>
We study numerically the impact of many-body interactions on the quantum
boomerang effect. We consider various cases: weakly interacting bosons, the
Tonks-Girardeau gas, and strongly interacting bosons (which may be mapped onto
weakly interacting fermions). Numerical simulations are performed using the
time-evolving block decimation algorithm, a quasi-exact method based on matrix
product states. In the case of weakly interacting bosons, we find a partial
destruction of the quantum boomerang effect, in agreement with the earlier
mean-field study [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{102}, 013303 (2020)]. For the
Tonks-Girardeau gas, we show the presence of the full quantum boomerang effect.
For strongly interacting bosons, we observe a partial boomerang effect. We show
that the destruction of the quantum boomerang effect is universal and does not
depend on the details of the interaction between particles.

Artificial spin ices (ASIs) are designable arrays of interacting nanomagnets
that span a wide range of magnetic phases associated with a number of spin
lattice models. Here, we demonstrate that the phase of an artificial kagome
spin ice can be determined from its initial magnetization curve. As a proof of
concept, micromagnetic simulations of these curves were performed starting from
representative microstates of different phases of the system. We show that the
curves are characterized by phase-specific features in such a way that a
pattern recognition algorithm predicts the phase of the initial microstate with
good reliability. This achievement represents a new strategy to identify phases
in ASIs, easier and more accessible than magnetic imaging techniques normally
used for this task.

<h3>Orbital liquid in the $e_g$ orbital Hubbard model in $d=\infty$  dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01884</a>
<br>
<i>Louis Felix Feiner, Andrzej M. Oleś</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that the three-dimensional $e_g$ orbital Hubbard model can be
generalized to arbitrary dimension $d$, and that the form of the result is
determined uniquely by the requirements that
(i) the two-fold degeneracy of the $e_g$ orbital be retained, and (ii) the
cubic lattice be turned into a hypercubic lattice. While the local Coulomb
interaction $U$ is invariant for each basis of orthogonal orbitals, the form of
the kinetic energy depends on the orbital basis and takes the most symmetric
form for the so-called complex-orbital basis. Characteristically, with respect
to this basis, the model has two hopping channels, one that is orbital-flavor
conserving, and a second one that is orbital-flavor non-conserving. We show
that the noninteracting electronic structure consists of two nondegenerate
bands of plane-wave real-orbital single-particle states for which the orbital
depends on the wave vector. Due to the latter feature each band is unpolarized
at any filling, and has a non-Gaussian density of states at $d=\infty$. The
\textit{orbital liquid} state is obtained by filling these two bands up to the
same Fermi energy. We investigate the $e_g$ orbital Hubbard model in the limit
$d\to\infty$, treating the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ within the
Gutzwiller approximation, thus determining the correlation energy of the
orbital liquid and the (disordered) para-orbital states. (...) We show that the
orbital liquid is the ground state everywhere in the $(n,U)$ phase diagram
except close to half-filling at sufficiently large $U$, where ferro-orbital
order with real orbitals occupied is favored. The latter feature is shown to be
specific for $d=\infty$, being of mathematical nature due to the exponential
tails in the density of states.

<h3>Quantum kinetic theory of nonlinear thermal current</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the second-order nonlinear electronic thermal transport
induced by temperature gradient. We develop the quantum kinetic theory
framework to describe thermal transport in presence of a temperature gradient.
Using this, we predict an intrinsic scattering time independent nonlinear
thermal current in addition to the known extrinsic nonlinear Drude and Berry
curvature dipole contributions. We show that the intrinsic thermal current is
determined by the band geometric quantities and is non-zero only in systems
where both the space inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken. We
employ the developed theory to study the thermal response in tilted massive
Dirac systems. We show that besides the different scattering time dependence,
the various current contributions have distinct temperature dependence in the
low temperature limit. Our systematic and comprehensive theory for nonlinear
thermal transport paves the way for future theoretical and experimental studies
on intrinsic thermal responses.

Many modern spintronic technologies, such as spin valves, spin Hall
applications, and spintronic THz emitters, are based on electrons crossing
buried internal interfaces within metallic nanostructures. However, the complex
current pathways within such nanostructures are difficult to disentangle using
conventional experimental methods. Here, we measure the conductivity of a
technologically relevant Ru/Co bilayer nanostructure in a contact-free fashion
using THz time-domain spectroscopy. By applying an effective resistor network
to the data, we resolve the complex current pathways within the nanostructure
and determine the degree of electronic transparency of the internal interface
between the Ru and Co nanolayers.

<h3>Dimensionality reduction of local structure in glassy binary mixtures</h3>

We consider unsupervised learning methods for characterizing the disordered
microscopic structure of supercooled liquids and glasses. Specifically, we
perform dimensionality reduction of smooth structural descriptors that describe
radial and bond-orientational correlations, and assess the ability of the
method to grasp the essential structural features of glassy binary mixtures. In
several cases, a few collective variables account for the bulk of the
structural fluctuations within the first coordination shell and also display a
clear connection with the fluctuations of particle mobility. Fine-grained
descriptors that characterize the radial dependence of bond-orientational order
better capture the structural fluctuations relevant for particle mobility, but
are also more difficult to parametrize and to interpret. We also find that
principal component analysis of bond-orientational order parameters provides
identical results to neural network autoencoders, while having the advantage of
being easily interpretable. Overall, our results indicate that glassy binary
mixtures have a broad spectrum of structural features. In the temperature range
we investigate, some mixtures display well-defined locally favored structures,
which are reflected in bimodal distributions of the structural variables
identified by dimensionality reduction.

<h3>Stochastic dynamics with multiplicative dichotomic noise: heterogeneous  telegrapher's equation, anomalous crossovers and resetting</h3>

We analyze diffusion processes with finite propagation speed in a
non-homogeneous medium in terms of the heterogeneous telegrapher's equation. In
the diffusion limit of infinite-velocity propagation we recover the results for
the heterogeneous diffusion process. The heterogeneous telegrapher's process
exhibits a rich variety of diffusion regimes including hyperdiffusion,
ballistic motion, superdiffusion, normal diffusion and subdiffusion, and
different crossover dynamics characteristic for complex systems in which
anomalous diffusion is observed. The anomalous diffusion exponent in the short
time limit is twice the exponent in the long time limit, in accordance to the
crossover dynamics from ballistic diffusion to normal diffusion in the standard
telegrapher's process. We also analyze the finite-velocity heterogeneous
diffusion process in presence of stochastic Poissonian resetting. We show that
the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state. The transition to this
non-equilibrium steady state is analysed in terms of the large deviation
function.

<h3>Non-local corrections to dynamical mean-field theory from the  two-particle self-consistent method</h3>

Theoretical methods that are accurate for both short-distance observables and
long-wavelength collective modes are still being developed for the Hubbard
model. Here, we benchmark against published diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo
results an approach that combines local observables from dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT) with the two-particle self-consistent theory (TPSC). This method
(TPSC+DMFT) is relevant for weak to intermediate interaction, satisfies the
local Pauli principle and allows us to compute a spin susceptibility that
satisfies the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The DMFT double occupancy determines the
spin and charge vertices through local spin and charge sum rules. The TPSC
self-energy is also improved by replacing its local part with the local DMFT
self-energy. With this method, we find improvements for both spin and charge
fluctuations and for the self-energy. We also find that the accuracy check
developed for TPSC is a good predictor of deviations from benchmarks. TPSC+DMFT
can be used in regimes where quantum Monte Carlo is inaccessible. In addition,
this method paves the way to multi-band generalizations of TPSC that could be
used in advanced electronic structure codes that include DMFT.

<h3>Dynamical fermionization in one-dimensional spinor gases at finite  temperature</h3>

Following the removal of axial confinement the momentum distribution of a
Tonks-Girardeau gas approaches that of a system of noninteracting spinless
fermions in the initial harmonic trap. This phenomenon, called dynamical
fermionization, has been experimentally confirmed in the case of the
Lieb-Liniger model and theoretically predicted in the case of multicomponent
systems at zero temperature. We prove analytically that for all spinor gases
with strong repulsive contact interactions at finite temperature the momentum
distribution after release from the trap asymptotically approaches that of a
system of spinless fermions at the same temperature but with a renormalized
chemical potential which depends on the number of components of the spinor
system. In the case of the Gaudin-Yang model we check numerically our
analytical predictions using the results obtained from a nonequilibrium
generalization of Lenard's formula describing the time evolution of the
field-field correlators.

<h3>Order and density fluctuations near the boundary in sheared dense  suspensions</h3>

<br>
<i>Joia M. Miller, Daniel L. Blair, Jeffrey S. Urbach</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a novel approach to reveal ordering fluctuations in sheared
dense suspensions, using line scanning in a combined rheometer and laser
scanning confocal microscope. We validate the technique with a moderately dense
suspension, observing modest shear-induced ordering and a nearly linear flow
profile. At high concentration ($\phi = 0.55$) and applied stress just below
shear thickening, we report ordering fluctuations with high temporal
resolution, and directly measure a decrease in order with distance from the
suspension's bottom boundary as well as a direct correlation between order and
particle concentration. Higher applied stress produces shear thickening with
large fluctuations in boundary stress which we find are accompanied by dramatic
fluctuations in suspension flow speeds. The peak flow rates are independent of
distance from the suspension boundary, indicating that they likely arise from
transient jamming that creates solid-like aggregates of particles moving
together, but only briefly because the high speed fluctuations are interspersed
with regions flowing much more slowly, suggesting that shear thickening
suspensions possess complex internal structural dynamics, even in relatively
simple geometries.

In the past decades, tremendous efforts have been made towards understanding
the exotic physics emerging from competition between various ordering
tendencies in strongly correlated systems. Employing state-of-the-art quantum
Monte-Carlo simulation, we investigate an interacting SU($N$) fermionic model
with varying interaction strength and value of $N$, and unveil the ground-state
phase diagram of the model exhibiting a plethora of exotic phases. For small
value of $N$, namely $N=2,3$, the ground state is antiferromagnetic (AFM)
phase, whereas in the large-$N$ limit, valence bound solid (VBS) order is
dominant. For the intermediate value of $N$ such as $N=4$, remarkably, our
study reveals distinct VBS orders appear in the weak and strong coupling
regimes. More fantastically, the competition between staggered and columnar VBS
ordering tendencies gives rise to a Mott insulating phase without spontaneously
symmetry breaking (SSB), existing in a large interacting parameter regime,
which is consistent with a gapped quantum spin liquid. Our study not only
provides a platform to investigate the fundamental physics of quantum many-body
systems, but also offers a novel route towards searching for exotic states of
matter such as quantum spin liquid in realistic quantum materials.

The physics of how molecules, organelles, and foreign objects move within
living cells has been extensively studied in organisms ranging from bacteria to
human cells. In mammalian cells, in particular, cellular vesicles move across
the cell using motor proteins that carry the vesicle down the cytoskeleton to
their destination. We have recently noted several similarities between the
motion of such vesicles and that in disordered, "glassy", systems, but it
remains unclear whether that is a general observation or something specific to
certain vesicles in one particular cell type. Here we follow the motion of
mitochondria, the organelles responsible for cell energy production, in several
mammalian cell types over timescales ranging from 50 ms up to 70 s. Qualitative
observations show that single mitochondria remain stalled, remaining within a
spatially limited region, for extended periods of time, before moving longer
distances relatively quickly. Analysing this motion quantitatively, we observe
a displacement distribution that is roughly Gaussian for shorter distances
($\lesssim$ 0.05 $\mu$m) but which exhibits exponentially decaying tails at
longer distances (up to 0.40 $\mu$m). We show that this behaviour is
well-described by a model originally developed to describe the motion in glassy
systems. These observations are extended to in total 3 different objects
(mitochondria, lysosomes and nano-sized beads enclosed in vesicles), 3
different mammalian cell types, from 2 different organisms (human and mouse).
We provide further evidence that supports glass-like characteristics of the
motion by showing a difference between the time it takes to move a longer
distance for the first time and subsequent times, as well as a weak ergodicity
breaking of the motion. Overall, we demonstrate the ubiquity of glass-like
motion in mammalian cells, providing a different perspective on intracellular
motion.

<h3>On the dielectric response function and phonon self energy of acoustic  phonons in 2D Dirac crystals</h3>

The unique structure of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac crystals, with electronic
bands linear in the proximity of the Brillouin-zone boundary and the Fermi
energy, creates anomalous situations where small Fermi-energy perturbations are
known to critically affect the electron-related lattice properties of the
system. The Fermi-surface nesting (FSN) conditions determining such effects via
electron-phonon interaction, require accurate estimates of the crystal's
response function $(\chi)$ as a function of the phonon wavevector q for any
values of temperature. Numerous analytical estimates of $\chi(q)$ for 2D Dirac
crystals beyond the Thomas-Fermi approximation have been so far carried out
only in terms of dielectric response function $\chi(q,\omega)$, for photon and
optical-phonon perturbations, due to relative ease of incorporating a
q-independent oscillation frequency in their calculation. However, models
accounting for Dirac-electron interaction with ever-existing acoustic phonons,
for which $\omega$ does depend on q and is therefore dispersive, are essential
to understand many critical crystal properties. The lack of such models has
often led to assume that the dielectric response function $\chi(q)$ in these
systems can be understood from free-electron behavior. Here, we show that,
different from free-electron systems, $\chi(q)$ calculated from acoustic
phonons in 2D Dirac crystals using the Lindhard model, exhibits a cuspidal
point at the FSN condition. Strong variability of $\frac{\partial\chi}{\partial
q}$ persists also at finite temperatures, while $\chi(q)$ may tend to infinity
in the dynamic case even where the speed of sound is small, albeit
nonnegligible, over the Dirac-electron Fermi velocity. The implications of our
findings for electron-acoustic phonon interaction and transport properties such
as the phonon line width derived from the phonon self energy will also be
discussed.

Recent ARPES experiments on doped 1D cuprates revealed the importance of
effective near-neighbor (NN) attractions in explaining certain features in
spectral functions. Here we investigate spectral properties of the extended
Hubbard model with the on-site repulsion $U$ and NN interaction $V$, by
employing bosonization analysis and the high-precision time-dependent
variational principle (TDVP) calculations of the model on 1D chain with up to
300 sites. From state-of-the-art TDVP calculations, we find that the spectral
weights of the holon-folding and $3k_F$ branches evolve oppositely as a
function of $V$. This peculiar dichotomy may be explained in bosonization
analysis from the opposite dependence of exponent that determines the spectral
weights on Luttinger parameter $K_{\rho}$. Moreover, our TDVP calculations of
models with fixed $U=8t$ and different $V$ show that $V\approx -1.7t$ may fit
the experimental results best, indicating a moderate effective NN attraction in
1D cuprates that might provide some hints towards understanding
superconductivity in 2D cuprates.

Above-bandgap femtosecond optical excitation of a ferroelectric/dielectric
BaTiO3/CaTiO3 superlattice leads to structural responses that are a consequence
of the screening of the strong electrostatic coupling between the component
layers. Time-resolved x-ray free-electron laser diffraction shows that the
structural response to optical excitation includes a net lattice expansion of
the superlattice consistent with depolarization-field screening driven by the
photoexcited charge carriers. The depolarization-field-screening-driven
expansion is separate from a photoacoustic pulse launched from the bottom
electrode on which the superlattice was epitaxially grown. The distribution of
diffracted intensity of superlattice x-ray reflections indicates that the
depolarization-field-screening-induced strain includes a photoinduced expansion
in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 and a contraction in CaTiO3. The magnitude of
expansion in BaTiO3 layers is larger than the contraction in CaTiO3. The
difference in the magnitude of depolarization-field-screening-driven strain in
the BaTiO3 and CaTiO3 components can arise from the contribution of the oxygen
octahedral rotation patterns at the BaTiO3/CaTiO3 interfaces to the
polarization of CaTiO3. The depolarization-field-screening-driven polarization
reduction in the CaTiO3 layers points to a new direction for the manipulation
of polarization in the component layers of a strongly coupled
ferroelectric/dielectric superlattice.
