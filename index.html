<h3>Effervescent waves in a binary mixture with non-reciprocal couplings</h3>

Non-reciprocal interactions between scalar fields that represent the
concentrations of two active species are known to break the parity and
time-reversal (PT) symmetries of the equilibrium state, as manifested in the
emergence of travelling waves. We explore the notion of nonlinear
non-reciprocity and consider a model in which the non-reciprocal interactions
can depend on the local values of the scalar fields. For generic cases where
such couplings exist, we observe the emergence of spatiotemporal chaos in the
steady-state. We associate this chaotic behaviour with a local restoration of
PT symmetry in fluctuating spatial domains, which leads to the coexistence of
oscillating densities and phase-separated droplets that are spontaneously
created and annihilated. We uncover that this phenomenon, which we denote as
effervescence, can exist as a dynamical steady-state in large parts of the
parameter space in two different incarnations, as characterized by the presence
or absence of an accompanying travelling wave.

<h3>Ultrafast charge carrier and exciton dynamics in an excitonic insulator probed by time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</h3>

An excitonic insulator phase is expected to arise from the spontaneous
formation of electron-hole pairs (excitons) in semiconductors where the exciton
binding energy exceeds the size of the electronic band gap. At low temperature,
these ground state excitons stabilize a new phase by condensing at lower energy
than the electrons at the valence band top, thereby widening the electronic
band gap. The envisioned opportunity to explore many-boson phenomena in an
excitonic insulator system is triggering a very active debate on how ground
state excitons can be experimentally evidenced. Here, we employ a
nonequilibrium approach to spectrally disentangle the photoinduced dynamics of
an exciton condensate from the entwined signature of the valence band
electrons. By means of time-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of
the occupied and unoccupied electronic states, we follow the complementary
dynamics of conduction and valence band electrons in the photoexcited
low-temperature phase of Ta2 NiSe5 , the hitherto most promising single-crystal
candidate to undergo a semiconductor-to-excitonic-insulator phase transition.
The photoexcited conduction electrons are found to relax within less than 1 ps.
Their relaxation time is inversely proportional to their excess energy, a
dependence that we attribute to the reduced screening of Coulomb interaction
and the low dimensionality of Ta2NiSe5 . Long after (> 10 ps) the conduction
band has emptied, the photoemission intensity below the Fermi energy has not
fully recovered the equilibrium value. Notably, this seeming carrier imbalance
cannot be rationalized simply by the relaxation of photoexcited electrons and
holes across the semiconducting band gap. [...]

Recent experiments have shown an indication of a hydrodynamic magnon behavior
in ultrapure ferromagnetic insulators; however, its direct observation is still
lacking. Here, we derive a set of coupled hydrodynamic equations and study the
thermal and spin conductivities for such a magnon fluid. We reveal the drastic
breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz law as a hallmark of the
hydrodynamics regime, which will become key evidence for the experimental
realization of an emergent hydrodynamic magnon behavior. Therefore, our results
pave the way towards the direct observation of magnon fluids.

<h3>Steady state correlations and induced trapping of an inertial AOUP particle</h3>

We study the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhnlenbeck particle
self-propelling in a confined harmonic well. The transport behaviour of the
particle is investigated by analyzing the particle trajectories, steady state
correlations, and mean square displacement (MSD). The steady state correlation
functions for the position as well as velocity are exactly calculated using
different methods. We explore how the inertia affects the dynamical behaviour,
when the particle is confined in a harmonic trap as well as when it is set
free. From the exact calculation of MSD, it is observed that the initial time
regimes are ballistic for both harmonically confined particle and free
particle, whereas the long time regimes are diffusive for a free particle and
non diffusive for a harmonically confined particle. One of our interesting
observation is that the harmonically confined particle gets more and more
confined with increase in the self propulsion time or activity time of the
dynamics and finally it gets trapped for very large self propulsion time. For a
free particle, the velocity correlation decays by the complex interplay between
the inertial time scale and the self propulsion time scale of the dynamics.
Moreover, decorrelation in velocity happens only when these two time scales are
of equal order.

Developing and maintaining life requires a lot of computation. This is done
by gene regulatory networks. But we have little understanding of how this
computation is organized. I show that there is a direct correspondence between
the structural and functional building blocks of regulatory networks, which I
call regulatory motifs. I derive a simple bound on the range of function that
these motifs can perform, in terms of the local network structure. I prove that
this range is a small fraction of all possible functions, which severely
constrains global network behavior. Part of this restriction is due to
redundancy in the function that regulatory motifs can achieve - there are many
ways to perform the same task. Regulatory motifs help us understanding how
genetic computation is organized and what it can achieve.

<h3>Membrane-based Optomechanical Accelerometry</h3>

<i>Mitul Dey Chowdhury, Aman R. Agrawal, Dalziel J. Wilson</i>
<br>
Optomechanical accelerometers promise quantum-limited readout, high detection
bandwidth, self-calibration, and radiation pressure stabilization. We present a
simple, scalable platform that enables these benefits with nano-$g$ sensitivity
at acoustic frequencies, based on a pair of vertically integrated Si$_3$N$_4$
membranes with different stiffnesses, forming an optical cavity. As a
demonstration, we integrate an ultrahigh-Q ($>10^7$), millimeter-scale
Si$_3$N$_4$ trampoline membrane above an unpatterned membrane on the same Si
chip, forming a finesse $\mathcal{F}\approx2$ cavity. Using direct
photodetection in transmission, we resolve the relative displacement of the
membranes with a shot-noise-limited imprecision of 7 fm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$,
yielding a thermal-noise-limited acceleration sensitivity of 562
n$g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a 1 kHz bandwidth centered on the fundamental
trampoline resonance (40 kHz). To illustrate the advantage of radiation
pressure stabilization, we cold damp the trampoline to an effective temperature
of 4 mK and leverage the reduced energy variance to resolve an applied
stochastic acceleration of 50 n$g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in an integration time of
minutes. In the future, we envision a small-scale array of these devices
operating in a cryostat to search for fundamental weak forces such as dark
matter.

<h3>Effect of parallel magnetic field on Klein tunneling in $pn$ and $pnp$ graphene trilayer junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>Abderrahim El Mouhafid, Ahmed Jellal</i>
<br>
The effect of a parallel magnetic field $B$ and a potential substrate on the
transmission, conductivity, and Fano factor of a biased ABC-stacked $pn$ and
$pnp$ trilayer graphene junction (ABC-TLG) is investigated theoretically at low
energy. We discovered that, in the presence of a high magnetic field $B=1400$T,
the ABC-TLG can exhibit new Klein tunneling at two new incidence $k_y$ values,
in addition to the usual value of $k_y=0$ and whatever the energy value is.
Indeed, the transmission of ABC-TLG via $ pn $ and $ pnp $ junctions is
transformed into a three-separate transmission of single-like graphene (SLG),
with Klein tunneling appearing at $k_y=0$ and $k_y=\pm\kappa$ ($\kappa$ is
highly dependent on $B$). Furthermore, the conductivity $\sigma$ and Fano
factor $F$ behave similarly to SLG, with ABC-TLG having the lowest
$\sigma=3g_0/\pi$ and highest $F=1/3$ at $B=1400$T and
$\sigma_{\text{TLG}}=3\sigma_{\text{SLG}}$.

<h3>Single spin Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana interferometry of Zeeman-split states with strong spin-orbit interaction in a double quantum dot</h3>

<br>
Single spin state evolution induced by the
Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference in a Zeeman-spit four
level system in a periodically driven double quantum dot is studied
theoretically by the Floquet stroboscopic method. An interplay between
spin-conserving and spin-flip tunneling processes with the Electric Dipole Spin
Resonance (EDSR) that is induced in an individual dot and enhanced by the LZSM
multiple level crossings with the neighboring quantum dot is investigated as a
function of the microwave (MW) frequency, driving amplitude, interdot detuning,
and magnetic field. A number of special points in the parameter space are
identified, out of which where all the three features are merged. Under this
triple-crossing resonance condition the interdot tunneling is combined with a
fast spin evolution in each dot at the EDSR frequency. Harmonics of the EDSR
are revealed in the spin-dependent tunneling maps versus variable magnetic
field and MW frequency. The results are applicable for both electron and hole
systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and may be useful for developing new
time-efficient schemes of the spin control and readout in qubit devices.

<h3>Measuring non-Unitarity in non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14944v1" target = "_blank">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14944v1</a>
<br>
<i>Yue-Yu Zou, Yao Zhou, Li-Mei Chen, Peng Ye</i>
<br>
Non-orthogonality in non-Hermitian quantum systems generates tremendous
exotic quantum phenomena, which can be fundamentally traced back to
non-unitarity and is much more fundamental and universal than complex energy
spectrum. In this paper, we introduce an interesting quantity (denoted as
$\eta$) to directly and efficiently measure non-unitarity and the associated
non-Hermitian physics. By tuning model parameters of underlying non-Hermitian
systems, we find that the discontinuity of both $\eta$ and its first-order
derivative (denoted as $\partial \eta$) pronouncedly captures rich physics that
is fundamentally caused by non-unitarity. More concretely, in a 1D
non-Hermitian topological system, two mutually orthogonal edge states that are
respectively localized on two boundaries become non-orthogonal in the vicinity
of discontinuity of $\eta$ as a function of model parameter, which is dubbed
edge state transition. For the discontinuity of $\partial\eta$, by
investigating a two-level non-Hermitian model, we establish the connection
between the points of discontinuity of $\partial \eta$ and exceptional
points~(EPs). Furthermore, for models with more than two levels, we
analytically obtain the upper bound of the quantity $\eta$ with a novel
dependence on the configuration of EPs. By investigating this connection in
more general lattice models, we find that two concrete models at phase
transition points have discontinuity of $\partial\eta$, implying the existence
of EPs, while another model constructed by the regular Sturm-Liouville theory
exhibit continuous and differentiable $\eta$ but doesn't have an EP at the
phase transition point. For more concrete applications and a systematic
analytic theory about $\eta$, we leave them for future work.

<h3>Emergent elasticity and topological stability of solitons</h3>

<br>
<i>Yangfan Hu</i>
<br>
Since the 1950s, topological solitons have been used to describe elementary
particles[1-3] and particle-like field configurations that appear in systems
ranging from subatomic to cosmological scales[3-6]. Particles are topologically
protected, for which transitions to states with different topological charges
are restricted. However, formation and annihilation of solitons are universal
in almost all branches of physics[7-16], which implies that topological
protection collapses at certain condition unrevealed[17, 18]. Here, we show
that solitons can be regarded as emergent elastic objects with spatially
dependent stiffness, and a second-order topological phase transition initiates
at its softened points, i.e., points with a vanishing eigenvalue of the
emergent stiffness matrix[19]. For example, the kink-antikink solution of the
sine-Gordon model[3, 4, 20] and the single-particle Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
transition of an isolated magnetic skyrmion[21, 22] with fixed modulus are both
second-order topological phase transitions, with softened points at the center
and at the exterior boundary, respectively. Annihilation of an isolated
skyrmion with changeable modulus at high magnetic field is a first-order
topological phase transition initiated at the center with a sharply decreased
yet not softened emergent stiffness. We anticipate our model to be a starting
point for a general study of topological stability of solitons in all field
theories.

<h3>Mortality equation characterizes the dynamics of an aging population</h3>

<i>Thomas Fink</i>
<br>
Aging is thought to be a consequence of intrinsic breakdowns in how genetic
information is processed. But mounting experimental evidence suggests that
aging can be slowed. To help resolve this mystery, I derive a mortality
equation which characterizes the dynamics of an evolving population with a
given maximum age. Remarkably, while the spectrum of eigenvalues that govern
the evolution depends on the fitness, how they change with the maximum age is
independent of fitness. This makes it possible to establish the conditions
under which programmed aging can provide an evolutionary benefit.

<h3>Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in as-deposited CoFeB/MgO thin films</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14913v1" target = "_blank">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14913v1</a>

<br>
Fabrication of perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic films on various
buffer layers, especially on numerous newly discovered spin-orbit torque (SOT)
materials to construct energy-efficient spin-orbitronic devices, is a
long-standing challenge. Even for the widely used CoFeB/MgO structures,
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) can only be established on limited
buffer layers through post-annealing above 300 {\deg}C. Here, we report that
the PMA of CoFeB/MgO films can be established reliably on various buffer layers
in the absence of post-annealing. Further results show that precise control of
MgO thickness, which determines oxygen diffusion in the underneath CoFeB layer,
is the key to obtaining the as-deposited PMA. Interestingly, contrary to
previous understanding, post-annealing does not influence the well-established
as-deposited PMA significantly but indeed enhances unsaturated PMA with a thick
MgO layer by modulating oxygen distributions, rather than crystallinity or Co-
and Fe-O bonding. Moreover, our results indicate that oxygen diffusion also
plays a critical role in the PMA degradation at high temperature. These results
provide a practical approach to build spin-orbitronic devices based on various
high-efficient SOT materials.

<h3>Clamping effect on temperature-induced valence transition in epitaxial EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ thin films grown on MgO(001)</h3>

<br>
Bulk EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ show a temperature-driven valence transisition of
europium from $\sim$+2 above 200 K to $\sim$+3 below 100 K, which is correlated
with a shrinking by approximatly 2 % of the crystal lattice along the two
a-axes. Due to this interconnection between lattice and electronic degrees of
freedom the influence of strain in epitaxial thin films is particularly
interesting. Ambient X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms an epitaxial relationship
of tetragonal EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ on MgO(001) with an out-of plane c-axis
orientation for the thin film, whereby the a-axes of both lattices align. XRD
at low temperatures reveals a strong coupling of the thin film lattice to the
substrate, showing no abrupt compression over the temperature range from 300 to
10 K. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at 300 and 20 K reveals a
temperature-independent valence of +2.0 for Eu. The evolving biaxial tensile
strain upon cooling is suggested to suppress the valence transition. Instead
low temperature transport measurements of the resistivity and the Hall effect
in a magnetic field up to 5 T point to a film thickness independent phase
transition at 16-20 K, indicating magnetic ordering.

<br>
As a function of the driving strength, a degenerate parametric oscillator
exhibits an instability at which spontaneous oscillations occur. Close to
threshold, both the nonlinearity as well as fluctuations are vital to the
accurate description of the dynamics. We study the statistics of the radiation
that is emitted by the degenerate parametric oscillator at threshold. The
cumulants obey a universal power-law scaling as a function of the nonlinearity.
The Fano factor shows a maximum close, but not coinciding, with the threshold.
Moreover, we predict a certain ratio of the first three cumulants to be
independent of the microscopic details of the system and connect the results to
experimental platforms.

<h3>Topological quantization of Fractional Quantum Hall conductivity</h3>

<br>
<i>J. Miller, M. A. Zubkov</i>
<br>
We consider the quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a system of interacting
electrons. Our formalism is valid for systems in the presence of an external
magnetic field, as well as for systems with a nontrivial band topology. That
is, the expressions for the conductivity derived are valid for both the
ordinary QHE and for the intrinsic anomalous QHE. The expression for the
conductivity applies to external fields that may vary in an arbitrary way, and
takes into account disorder. It is assumed that the ground state of the system
is degenerate. We represent the QHE conductivity as $\frac{e^2}{h} \times
\frac{\cal N}{K}$, where $K$ is the degeneracy of the ground state, while $\cal
N$ is the topological invariant composed of the Wigner - transformed multi -
leg Green functions. $\cal N$ takes discrete values, which gives rise to
quantization of the fractional QHE conductivity.

<i>V. V. Marchenkov, V. Yu. Irkhin, A. A. Semiannikova</i>
<br>
The review considers various groups of Heusler compounds, which can have the
properties of a semiconductor, a half-metallic ferromagnet, a spin gapless
semiconductor, a topological semimetal, and a noncollinear antiferromagnet. In
these Heusler compounds, "conventional" from the point of view of the crystal
structure, unusual kinetic and magnetic properties can be observed, which are
caused by the features of their electronic structure (e.g., presence of an
energy gap for one spin projection) and magnetic state (e.g., strong
ferromagnetism, compensated ferrimagnetism, etc.). Their magnetic and kinetic
characteristics are very sensitive to external influences. Depending on the
alloy composition and external parameters, transitions between the considered
states can be realized. All this opens up further prospects for controlling the
electronic and magnetic characteristics of such compounds and their practical
application.

<br>
In twisted h-BN/graphene heterostructures, the complex electronic properties
of the fast-traveling electron gas in graphene are usually considered to be
fully revealed. However, the randomly twisted heterostructures may also have
unexpected transition behaviors, which may influence the device performance.
Here, we study the twist angle-dependent coupling effects of h-BN/graphene
heterostructures using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy. We find
that the moir\'e potentials alter the band structure of graphene, resulting in
a redshift of the intralayer transition at the M-point, which becomes more
pronounced up to 0.25 eV with increasing twist angle. Furthermore, the twisting
of the Brillouin zone of h-BN relative to the graphene M-point leads to tunable
vertical transition energies in the range of 5.1-5.6 eV. Our findings indicate
that twist-coupling effects of van der Waals heterostructures should be
carefully considered in device fabrications, and the continuously tunable
interband transitions through the twist angle can serve as a new degree of
freedom to design optoelectrical devices.

We use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly determine the
renormalization group fixed points of a $q$-state Potts model coupled to an
$r$-state Potts model in two dimensions. For integer values of $q$ and $r$ the
fixed point equations are very constraining and show in particular that scale
invariance in coupled Potts ferromagnets is limited to the Ashkin-Teller case
($q=r=2$). Since our results extend to continuous values of the number of
states, we can access the limit $r\to 1$ corresponding to correlated
percolation, and show that the critical properties of Potts spin clusters
cannot in general be obtained from those of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters by
analytical continuation.

Continuous tensor network gives a variational ansatz for the ground state of
the quantum field theories (QFTs). The notable examples are the continuous
matrix product state (cMPS) and the continuous multiscale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (cMERA). While cMPS is just adapted to the
non-relativistic QFTs, only the Gaussian cMERA is well-understood which we can
not use to approximate the ground state of the interacting relativistic QFTs.
But instead, cMERA also corresponds to a real-space renormalization group flow
in the context of the wave functions. In this letter, we investigate the
backward Gaussian cMERA renormalization group flow of the class of cMPS by
putting the standard cMPS at the IR scale. At the UV scale, for the bosonic
systems in the thermodynamic limit, we achieve the variational class of states
that has been proposed recently as the relativistic cMPS (RCMPS) is adapted to
the relativistic QFTs without requiring to introduce of any additional IR or UV
cut-off. We also extend the RCMPS to fermionic systems and theories on a finite
circle.

Topological signals, i.e., dynamical variables defined on nodes, links,
triangles, etc. of higher-order networks, are attracting increasing attention.
However the investigation of their collective phenomena is only at its infancy.
Here we combine topology and nonlinear dynamics to determine the conditions for
global synchronization of topological signals on simplicial and cell complexes.
On simplicial complexes we show that topological obstruction impedes odd
dimensional signals to globally synchronize. On the other hand, we show that
cell complexes can overcome topological obstruction and in some structures,
signals of any dimension can achieve global synchronization.

Spin waves in non-collinear magnets with $C_{nv}$ symmetry are discussed in
the context of inelastic neutron scattering in small-angle scattering geometry.
In the framework of minimal model including exchange coupling,
Dzayloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and single-ion anisotropy, we consider
the system properties at moderate external fields and in the high-field fully
polarized phase. In the latter case, the magnon spectrum is gapped and
non-reciprocal due to DMI with the minimum perpendicular to the field direction
for in-plane field and is ferromagnetic-like for the field along the
high-symmetry axis. Inelastic small-angle neutron scattering in the fully
polarized phase (SWSANS) is considered in four different geometries. It is
shown that analysis of field dependence of the SWSANS cutoff feature in these
geometries allows determining all important parameters of the model.
Possibility of the proposed method utilization in thin films with interfacial
DMI is also discussed.

the dual charge. We study its properties and use it to discretize the potential
in one and three space dimensions.

<br>
We study a model for photovoltaic energy collection consisting of a Mott
insulating layer in presence of acoustic phonons, coupled to two wide-band
fermion leads at different chemical potentials and driven into a nonequilibrium
steady state by a periodic electric field. We treat electron correlations with
nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) using the so-called auxiliary
master equation approach as impurity solver and include dissipation by acoustic
phonons via the Migdal approximation. For a small hybridization to the leads,
we obtain a peak in the photocurrent as a function of the driving frequency
which can be associated with impact ionization processes. For larger
hybridizations the shallow peak suggests a suppression of impact ionization
with respect to direct photovoltaic excitations. Acoustic phonons slightly
enhance the photocurrent for small driving frequencies and suppress it at
frequencies around the main peak at all considered hybridization strengths.

<h3>Synthetic Fuzzballs: A Linear Ramp from Black Hole Normal Modes</h3>

<br>
We consider a black hole with a stretched horizon as a toy model for a
fuzzball microstate. The stretched horizon provides a cut-off, and therefore
one can determine the normal (as opposed to quasi-normal) modes of a probe
scalar in this geometry. For the BTZ black hole, we compute these as a function
of the level $n$ and the angular quantum number $J$. Conventional level
repulsion is absent in this system, and yet we find that the Spectral Form
Factor (SFF) shows clear evidence for a dip-ramp-plateau structure with a
linear ramp of slope $\sim 1$ on a log-log plot, with or without ensemble
averaging. We show that this is a robust feature of stretched horizons by
repeating our calculations on the Rindler wedge (times a compact space). We
also observe that this is {\em not} a generic feature of integrable systems, as
illustrated by standard examples like integrable billiards and random 2-site
coupled SYK model, among others. The origins of the ramp can be traced to the
hierarchically weaker dependence of the normal mode spectrum on the quantum
numbers of the compact directions, and the resulting quasi-degeneracy. We
conclude by noting an analogy between the 4-site coupled SYK model and the
quartic coupling responsible for the non-linear instability of capped
geometries. Based on this, we speculate that incorporating probe
self-interactions will lead to stronger connections to random matrix behavior.

<h3>Second-order phase transition of silicon from a band insulator to metal induced by strong magnetic fields</h3>

<br>
We present the second-order phase transition from a band insulator to metal
that is induced by a strong magnetic field. The magnetic-field dependences of
the magnetization and energy band gap of a crystalline silicon immersed in a
magnetic field are investigated by means of the nonperturbative
magnetic-field-containing relativistic tight-binding approximation method
[Phys. Rev. B 97, 195135 (2018)]. It is shown that the energy band gap
disappears at the critical magnetic field of 2.22x$10^4$ (T). At the critical
magnetic field, the magnetic-field dependence of the magnetization exhibits a
kink behavior, which means that this phenomenon is the second-order phase
transition from a band insulator to metal. It is found that in strong magnetic
fields above the critical magnetic field, namely in the metallic phase, the
oscillation of the magnetization appears. It is shown that this magnetic
oscillation comes from the energy bands in the magnetic Brillouin zone that
change from the occupied states to unoccupied states or vice vasa.

We demonstrate comprehensive numerical studies on a hybrid III-V/Si-based
waveguide system, serving as a platform for efficient light coupling between an
integrated III-V quantum dot emitter to an on-chip quantum photonic integrated
circuit defined on a silicon substrate. We propose a platform consisting of a
hybrid InP/Si waveguide and an InP-embedded InAs quantum dot, emitting at the
telecom C-band near 1550 nm. The platform can be fabricated using the existing
semiconductor processing technologies. Our numerical studies reveal nearly 86%
of the optical field transfer efficiency between geometrically-optimized InP/Si
and Si waveguides, considering propagating field modes along a tapered
geometry. The coupling efficiency of a dipole emitting to the hybrid InP/Si
waveguide is evaluated to ~60%, which results in more than 50% of the total
on-chip optical field transfer efficiency from the dipole to the Si waveguide.
We also consider the off-chip outcoupling efficiency of the propagating photon
field along the Si waveguide by examining the normal to the chip plane and
in-plain outcoupling configurations. In the former case, the outcoupling
amounts to ~26% when using the circular Bragg grating outcoupler design. In the
latter case, the efficiency reaches up to 10%. Finally, we conclude that the
conceptual device's performance is weakly susceptible to the transferred photon
wavelength, offering a broadband operation within the 1.5-1.6 {\mu}m spectral
range.

A practical implementation of a quantum computer requires robust qubits that
are protected against their noisy environment. Dynamical decoupling techniques
have been successfully used in the past to offer protected high-fidelity gate
operations in negatively-charged Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond,
albeit under specific conditions with the intrinsic nitrogen nuclear spin
initialised. In this work, we show how the SMART protocol, an extension of the
dressed-qubit concept, can be implemented for continuous protection to offer
Clifford gate fidelities compatible with fault-tolerant schemes, whilst
prolonging the coherence time of a single NV- qubit at room temperature. We
show an improvement in the average Clifford gate fidelity from $0.940\pm0.005$
for the bare qubit to $0.993\pm0.002$ for the SMART qubit, with the nitrogen
nuclear spin in a random orientation. We further show a $\gtrsim$ 30 times
improvement in the qubit coherence times compared to the bare qubit.

<h3>CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ and YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$: Strange Cases of Heavy-Fermion Superconductivity</h3>

<br>
The heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ exhibits two-band,
$d$-wave superconductivity with a finite energy gap over the whole Fermi
surface around the magnetic instability where 4$f$ antiferrerromagnetic order
is suppressed. In contrast, in YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ heavy-fermion
superconductivity appears only when 4$f$-electronic antiferromagnetic order is
replaced at ultra-low temperatures by a combined nuclear and 4$f$-spin order.
Whereas both compounds exhibit different variants of antiferromagnetic
instabilities, i.e., a spin-density-wave quantum critical point in
CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ and one of "partial-Mott" type in YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, in
both cases the Cooper pairing, as well as the pronounced "strange-metal"
behavior in YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, appear to be driven by large-to-small Fermi
surface fluctuations. The transport properties and scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) for these materials are dominated by single-ion Kondo
scatterings down to very low temperatures. Further open problems of the Kondo
lattice include both the interplay between superconductivity and
antiferromagnetic order as well as the onset of lattice coherence. While
microscopic coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism seems to
require a sufficiently large staggered moment, the onset of lattice coherence
in transport measurements and STS is associated solely with the
crystal-field-doublet ground state, while it involves the fully degenerate
Hund's rule multiplet in ARPES.

<h3>Brownian motion theory of the two-dimensional quantum vortex gas</h3>

<br>
<i>Hiroshi Kuratsuji</i>
<br>
A theory of Brownian motion is presented for an assembly of vortices. The
attempt is motivated by a realization of Dyson' Coulomb gas in the context of
quantum condensates. By starting with the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg (LG)
theory, the dynamics of the vortex gas is constructed, which is governed by the
canonical equation of motion. The dynamics of point vortices is converted to
the Langevin equation, which results in the generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) (or
Smolkovski) equation using the functional integral on the ansatz of the
Gaussian white noise. The GFP, which possesses a non-Hermitian property, is
characterized by two regimes called the "overdamping" and the "underdamping"
regime. In the overdamping regime, where the dissipation is much larger than
the vortex strength, the GFP becomes the standard Fokker-Planck equation, which
is transformed to the two-dimensional many particle system. Several specific
applications are given of the Fokker-Planck equation. An asymptotic limit of
small diffusion is also discussed for the two vortices system. The underdamping
limit, for which the vortex charge is much larger than the dissipation, is
briefly discussed.

<br>
Metals can be defined as materials with a Fermi surface or as materials
exhibiting metallic conduction (i.e., $\mathrm{d} \rho / \mathrm{d}T > 0$).
Usually, these definitions both hold at low temperatures, such as liquid-helium
temperatures, as the Fermi energy is sufficiently larger than the thermal
energy. However, they may not both hold in correlated electron systems where
the Fermi energy is reduced by renormalization. In this paper, we demonstrate
that although the resistivity of CeFe$_2$Al$_{10}$ increases with decreasing
temperature below $\sim20$ K, CeFe$_2$Al$_{10}$ is a metal with a Fermi
surface. This assertion is based on the observation of Shubnikov--de Haas
oscillations and a Hall resistivity that changes sign with the magnetic field,
which requires the coexistence of electron and hole carriers. Our analysis of
Shubnikov--de Haas and magnetotransport data indicates that the Fermi energies
are as small as $\sim$30 K and that, despite the increasing carrier mobility
with decreasing temperature as in conventional metals, the loss of thermally
excited carriers leads to nonmetallic conduction ($\mathrm{d} \rho /
\mathrm{d}T < 0$) below $\sim20$ K. Furthermore, we investigate how this
anomalous metal transforms to a more conventional metal with metallic
conduction by the application of high pressure and a high magnetic field. This
study illustrates the subtle distinction between semimetals and semiconductors
in correlated electron systems. This distinction is relevant to investigations
of correlated topological insulators and semimetals.

<br>
I describe a concrete and efficient real-space renormalization approach that
provides a unifying perspective on interface states in a wide class of
Hermitian and non-Hermitian models, irrespective of whether they obey a
traditional bulk-boundary principle or not. The emerging interface physics are
governed by a flow of microscopic interface parameters, and the properties of
interface states become linked to the fixed-point topology of this flow. In
particular, the quantization condition of interface states converts identically
into the question of the convergence to unstable fixed points. As its key
merit, the approach can be directly applied to concrete models and utilized to
design interfaces that induce states with desired properties, such as states
with a predetermined and possibly symmetry-breaking energy. I develop the
approach in general, and then demonstrate these features in various settings,
including for the design of circular, triangular and square-shaped complex
dispersion bands and associated arcs at the edge of a two-dimensional system.

<h3>Ultrafast charge carrier and exciton dynamics in an excitonic insulator probed by time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
An excitonic insulator phase is expected to arise from the spontaneous
formation of electron-hole pairs (excitons) in semiconductors where the exciton
binding energy exceeds the size of the electronic band gap. At low temperature,
these ground state excitons stabilize a new phase by condensing at lower energy
than the electrons at the valence band top, thereby widening the electronic
band gap. The envisioned opportunity to explore many-boson phenomena in an
excitonic insulator system is triggering a very active debate on how ground
state excitons can be experimentally evidenced. Here, we employ a
nonequilibrium approach to spectrally disentangle the photoinduced dynamics of
an exciton condensate from the entwined signature of the valence band
electrons. By means of time-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of
the occupied and unoccupied electronic states, we follow the complementary
dynamics of conduction and valence band electrons in the photoexcited
low-temperature phase of Ta2 NiSe5 , the hitherto most promising single-crystal
candidate to undergo a semiconductor-to-excitonic-insulator phase transition.
The photoexcited conduction electrons are found to relax within less than 1 ps.
Their relaxation time is inversely proportional to their excess energy, a
dependence that we attribute to the reduced screening of Coulomb interaction
and the low dimensionality of Ta2NiSe5 . Long after (> 10 ps) the conduction
band has emptied, the photoemission intensity below the Fermi energy has not
fully recovered the equilibrium value. Notably, this seeming carrier imbalance
cannot be rationalized simply by the relaxation of photoexcited electrons and
holes across the semiconducting band gap. [...]

Oxide based electrides are materials in which topotactic removal of loosely
bound oxygens leaves behind voids with a landscape of attractive potentials for
electrons. We find that this is also what happens in the recently discovered
infinite-layer nickelates where one of the two extra electrons needed for
charge neutrality when the apical oxygen is removed from the cubic perovskite
precursor compound is to a large degree located in the oxygen vacancy position
rather than both mainly used to convert Ni from 3+ to 1+. This is shown to be
the main reason for the theoretical difficulty in determining the much debated
elusive Fermi surface of these novel superconductors.

<br>
Real materials always contain, to some extent, randomness in the form of
defects or irregularities. It is known since the seminal work of Anderson that
randomness can drive a metallic phase to an insulating one, and the mechanism
responsible for this transition is intrinsically different from the one of the
interaction-induced transitions discovered by Mott. Lattice Hamiltonians, with
their conceptual and computational advantages, permitted to investigate broadly
the interplay of both mechanisms. However, a clear understanding of the
differences (or not) with their real-space counterparts is lacking, especially
in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. This work aims at shedding
light on this challenging question by investigating a real-space
one-dimensional model of interacting electrons in the presence of a disordered
potential. The transition between delocalized and localized phases are
characterized using two different indicators, namely the single-particle
occupation entropy and the position-space information entropy. In addition, the
performance of density functional approximations to reproduce the exact
ground-state densities of this many-body localization model are gauged.

The optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides have previously
been modified at the nanoscale by using mechanical and electrical
nanostructuring. However, a clear experimental picture relating the local
electronic structure with emission properties in such structures has so far
been lacking. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
and near-field photoluminescence (nano-PL) to probe the electronic and optical
properties of single nano-bubbles in bilayer heterostructures of WSe2 on MoSe2.
We show from tunneling spectroscopy that there are electronic states deeply
localized in the gap at the edge of such bubbles, which are independent of the
presence of chemical defects in the layers. We also show a significant change
in the local bandgap on the bubble, with a continuous evolution to the edge of
the bubble over a length scale of ~20 nm. Nano-PL measurements observe a
continuous redshift of the interlayer exciton on entering the bubble, in
agreement with the band to band transitions measured by STM. We use
self-consistent Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) simulations to capture the essence
of the experimental results and find that strong doping in the bubble region is
a key ingredient to achieving the observed localized states, together with
mechanical strain.

Fluctuations arising in nonlinear dissipative systems (diode, transistors,
chemical reaction, etc.) subject to an external drive (voltage, chemical
potential, etc.) are well known to elude any simple characterisation such as
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (also called Johnson-Nyquist law, or
Einstein's law in specific contexts). Using results from stochastic
thermodynamics, we show that the variance of these fluctuations exceeds the
variance predicted by a suitably extended version of Johnson-Nyquist's formula,
by an amount that is controlled by the skewness (third moment) of the
fluctuations. As a consequence, symmetric fluctuations necessarily obey the
extended Johnson-Nyquist formula. This shows the physical inconsistency of
Gaussian approximation for the noise arising in some nonlinear models, such as
MOS transistors or chemical reactions.

<h3>Straightening Out the Frobenius-Schur Indicator</h3>

<br>
The Frobenius-Schur indicator is a parameter $\kappa_a=\pm 1$ assigned to
each self-dual particle $a$ in a TQFT. If $\kappa_a$ is negative then
straightening out a timelike zig-zag in the worldline of a particle of type $a$
can incur a minus sign and in this case the amplitude associated with the
diagram is not invariant under deformation. This has caused some confusion
about the topological invariance of even simple theories to space-time
deformations. We clarify that, given a TQFT with negative Frobenius-Schur
indicators, there are two distinct conventions commonly used to interpret a
spacetime diagram as a physical amplitude, only one of which is isotopy
invariant. We clarify in what sense TQFTs based on Chern-Simons theory with
negative Frobenius-Schur indicators are isotopy invariant, and we explain how
the Frobenius-Schur indicator is intimately linked with the need to frame
world-lines in Chern-Simons theory. Further, in the non-isotopy-invariant
interpretation of the diagram algebra we show how a trick of bookkeeping can
usually be invoked to push minus signs onto the diagrammatic value of a loop
(the "loop weight"), such that most of the evaluation of a diagram does not
incur minus signs from straightening zig-zags, and only at the last step minus
signs are added. We explain the conditions required for this to be possible. We
then further examine what is required in order for a theory to have full
isotopy invariance of planar spacetime diagrams, and discover that, if we have
successfully pushed the signs from zig-zags onto the loop weight, the only
possible obstruction to this is given by an object related to vertices, known
as the "third Frobenius-Schur indicator". We finally discuss the extent to
which this gives us full isotopy invariance for braided theories.

We explore the possibility of using superfluid helium for direct detection of
sub-GeV dark matter (DM). We discuss the relevant phenomenology resulting from
the scattering of an incident dark matter particle on a Helium nucleus. Rather
than directly exciting quasi-particles, DM in this mass range will interact
with a single He atom, triggering an atomic cascade which eventually also
includes emission and thermalization of quasi-particles. We present in detail
the analytical framework needed for modeling these processes and determining
the resulting flux of quasi-particles. We propose a novel method for detecting
this flux with modern force-sensitive devices, such as nanoelectro-mechanical
system (NEMS) oscillators, and derive the sensitivity projections for a generic
sub-GeV DM detection experiment using such sensors.

We study inhomogeneous 1+1-dimensional quantum many-body systems described by
Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid theory with general propagation velocity and
Luttinger parameter varying smoothly in space, equivalent to an inhomogeneous
compactification radius for free boson conformal field theory. This model
appears prominently in low-energy descriptions, including for trapped
ultra-cold atoms, while here we give an application to quantum Hall edges with
inhomogeneous interactions. The dynamics is shown to be governed by a pair of
coupled continuity equations identical to inhomogeneous Dirac-Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations with a local gap and solved by exact analytical means. We
obtain their exact Green's functions and scattering matrix using Magnus
expansions, which generalize previous results for conformal interfaces and
quantum wires coupled to leads. Our results explicitly describe the late-time
evolution following quantum quenches, including inhomogeneous interaction
quenches, and Andreev reflections between coupled quantum Hall edges, revealing
a remarkably universal dependence on details at stationarity or at late times
out of equilibrium.

Recent experiments have shown an indication of a hydrodynamic magnon behavior
in ultrapure ferromagnetic insulators; however, its direct observation is still
lacking. Here, we derive a set of coupled hydrodynamic equations and study the
thermal and spin conductivities for such a magnon fluid. We reveal the drastic
breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz law as a hallmark of the
hydrodynamics regime, which will become key evidence for the experimental
realization of an emergent hydrodynamic magnon behavior. Therefore, our results
pave the way towards the direct observation of magnon fluids.

Axions and axion-like particles may couple to nuclear spins like a weak
oscillating effective magnetic field, the "axion wind." Existing proposals for
detecting the axion wind sourced by dark matter exploit analogies to nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) and aim to detect the small transverse field generated
when the axion wind resonantly tips the precessing spins in a polarized sample
of material. We describe a new proposal using the homogeneous precession domain
(HPD) of superfluid helium-3 as the detection medium, where the effect of the
axion wind is a small shift in the precession frequency of a large-amplitude
NMR signal. We argue that this setup can provide broadband detection of
multiple axion masses simultaneously, and has competitive sensitivity to other
axion wind experiments such as CASPEr-Wind at masses below $10^{-7}$ eV by
exploiting precision frequency metrology in the readout stage.

We study the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhnlenbeck particle
self-propelling in a confined harmonic well. The transport behaviour of the
particle is investigated by analyzing the particle trajectories, steady state
correlations, and mean square displacement (MSD). The steady state correlation
functions for the position as well as velocity are exactly calculated using
different methods. We explore how the inertia affects the dynamical behaviour,
when the particle is confined in a harmonic trap as well as when it is set
free. From the exact calculation of MSD, it is observed that the initial time
regimes are ballistic for both harmonically confined particle and free
particle, whereas the long time regimes are diffusive for a free particle and
non diffusive for a harmonically confined particle. One of our interesting
observation is that the harmonically confined particle gets more and more
confined with increase in the self propulsion time or activity time of the
dynamics and finally it gets trapped for very large self propulsion time. For a
free particle, the velocity correlation decays by the complex interplay between
the inertial time scale and the self propulsion time scale of the dynamics.
Moreover, decorrelation in velocity happens only when these two time scales are
of equal order.

Most superconductors have an isotropic, single component order parameter, and
are well described by the BCS theory for superconductivity. Unconventional,
multiple components superconductors are exceptionally rare and are much less
understood. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved
macroscopic transport to study the candidate chiral superconductor,
4Hb-TaS$_2$. We reveal quasi-periodic one-dimensional modulations in the
tunneling conductance accompanied by two-fold symmetric superconducting
critical field. The strong modulation of the in-plane critical field, points to
a nematic, unconventional order parameter. However, the imaged vortex core is
nearly circular symmetric, suggesting an isotropic order parameter. We
reconcile this apparent discrepancy by modeling a competition between a
dominating chiral superconducting order parameter and a nematic one, the latter
emerges close to the normal phase. Our results strongly support the existence
of two-component superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and can provide useful
insights to other systems with coexistent charge order and superconductivity.

<h3>Local integrals of motion and the stability of many-body localisation in disorder-free systems</h3>

Many-body localisation in disordered systems in one spatial dimension is
typically understood in terms of the existence of an extensive number of
(quasi)-local integrals of motion (LIOMs) which are thought to decay
exponentially with distance and interact only weakly with one another. By
contrast, little is known about the form of the integrals of motion in
disorder-free systems which exhibit localisation. Here, we explicitly compute
the LIOMs for disorder-free localised systems, focusing on the case of a
linearly increasing potential. We show that while in the absence of
interactions, the LIOMs decay faster than exponentially, the addition of
interactions leads to the formation of a spatially extended plateau. We study
how varying the linear slope affects the localisation properties of the LIOMs,
finding that there is a significant finite-size dependence, and present
evidence that adding a weak harmonic potential does not result in typical
many-body localisation phenomenology. By contrast, the addition of disorder has
a qualitatively different effect, dramatically modifying the properties of the
LIOMs. Based on this, we speculate that disorder-free localisation is unlikely
to be stable at long times and for large systems.

In this work we investigate non-Hermitian topological phase transitions using
real-space edge states as a paradigmatic tool. We focus on the simplest
non-Hermitian variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model, including a parameter
that denotes the degree of non-hermiticity of the system. We study the behavior
of the zero energy edge states at the non-trivial topological phases with
integer and semi-integer topological winding number, according to the distance
to the critical point. We obtain that depending on the parameters of the model
the edge states may penetrate into the bulk, as expected in Hermitian
topological phase transitions. We also show that using the topological
characterization of the exceptional points, we can describe the intricate
chiral behavior of the edge states across the whole phase diagram. Moreover, we
characterize the criticality of the model by determining the correlation length
critical exponent, directly from numerical calculations of the penetration
length of the zero modes edge states.

We solve the Dirac equation in three regions of graphene to get the solutions
of the energy spectrum in connection to the strain, energy gap, and magnetic
field. The Goos-H\"anchen shifts and group delay time will be obtained by
applying the stationary phase approximation after the wave functions at the
interfaces have been matched. Our results suggest that the group delay time is
influenced by the presence of strain along the armchair and zigzag directions.
We show that the gate voltage and strain have the ability to change the group
delay from subluminality to superluminality. This may have significant uses in
high-speed graphene-based nanoelectronics.
