<h3>Tensor Electromagnetism and Emergent Elasticity in Jammed Solids</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11811v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11811v1</a>

The theory of mechanical response and stress transmission in disordered,
jammed solids poses several open questions of how non-periodic networks --
apparently indistinguishable from a snapshot of a fluid -- sustain shear. We
present a stress-only theory of emergent elasticity for a non-thermal amorphous
assembly of grains in a jammed solid, where each grain is subjected to
mechanical constraints of force and torque balance. These grain-level
constraints lead to the Gauss's law of an emergent $U(1)$ tensor
electromagnetism, which then accounts for the mechanical response of such
solids. This formulation of amorphous elasticity has several immediate
consequences. The mechanical response maps exactly to the static, dielectric
response of this tensorial electromagnetism with the polarizability of the
medium mapping to emergent elastic moduli. External forces act as vector
electric charges whereas the tensorial magnetic fields are sourced by momentum
density. The dynamics in the electric and magnetic sectors, naturally translate
into the dynamics of the rigid jammed network and ballistic particle motion
respectively. The theoretical predictions for both stress-stress correlations
and responses are borne out by the results of numerical simulations of
frictionless granular packings in the static limit of the theory in both 2D and
3D.

<h3>Y-Systems for Generalised Gibbs Ensembles in Integrable Quantum Field Theory</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11749v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11749v1</a>

The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz approach to the study of integrable quantum
field theories was introduced in the early 90s. Since then it has been known
that the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations can be recast in the form of
$Y$-systems. These $Y$-systems have a number of interesting properties, notably
in the high-temperature limit their solutions are constants from which the
central charge of the ultraviolet fixed point can be obtained and they are
typically periodic functions, with period proportional to the dimension of the
perturbing field. In this letter we discuss the derivation of $Y$-systems when
the standard thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations are replaced by generalised
versions, describing generalised Gibbs ensembles. We shown that for many
theories, there is a large class of distinct generalised Gibbs ensembles which
share the same $Y$-system.

<h3>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and Free Probability</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11679v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11679v1</a>

Quantum thermalization is well understood via the Eigenstate Thermalization
Hypothesis (ETH). The general form of ETH, describing all the relevant
correlations of matrix elements, may be derived on the basis of a `typicality'
argument of invariance with respect to local rotations involving nearby energy
levels. In this work, we uncover the close relation between this perspective on
ETH and Free Probability theory, as applied to a thermal ensemble or an energy
shell. This mathematical framework allows one to express in an unambiguous way
high order connected correlation functions (here identified as free cumulants)
in terms of standard correlation functions. This perspective naturally
incorporates the consistency property that local functions of ETH operators
also satisfy ETH. The present results open a direct connection between quantum
thermalization and the mathematical structure of Free Probability, thus
offering the basis for insightful analogies and new developments.

<h3>Dynamics of Fluctuations in the Open Quantum SSEP and Free Probability</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11680v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11680v1</a>

The quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (Q-SSEP) is a simple model of
spinless fermions hopping on a one-dimensional chain to neighbouring sites with
random amplitudes. It was proposed as a toy model to study the fluctuations of
coherent (i.e. purely quantum mechanical) effects in out-of-equilibrium
many-body quantum systems. The aim is to describe these coherent effects at a
mesoscopic scale and to establish a universal framework which might be
applicable to a larger class of mesoscopic systems. Here we formulate the
scaling limit of the time dynamics of fluctuating coherences in the open
Q-SSEP, i.e. in the case when the one-dimensional chain is coupled to particle
reservoirs on the boundaries to maintain it out-of-equilibrium. We show that
the fluctuating coherences have a natural interpretation in terms of free
cumulants, a concept from free probability theory which thus seems to be an
appropriate framework to deal with fluctuating quantum many body systems
out-of-equilibrium.

<h3>Microscopic field theory for structure formation in systems of self-propelled particles with generic torques</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11571v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11571v1</a>
<br>
<i>Elena Ses-Sansa, Demian Levis, Ignacio Pagonabarraga</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive a dynamical field theory for self-propelled particles subjected to
generic torques and forces by explicitly coarse-graining their microscopic
dynamics, described by a many-body Fokker-Planck equation. The model includes
both intrinsic torques inducing self-rotation, as well as interparticle torques
leading to, for instance, the local alignment of particles' orientations.
Within this approach, although the functional form of the pairwise interactions
does not need to be specified, one can directly map the parameters of the field
theory onto the parameters of particle-based models. We perform a linear
stability analysis of the homogeneous solution of the field equations and find
both long-wavelength and short-wavelength instabilities. The former signals the
emergence of a macroscopic structure, which we associate with motility-induced
phase separation, while the second one signals the growth of a finite structure
with a characteristic size. Intrinsic torques hinder phase separation, pushing
the onset of the long-wavelength instability to higher activities. Further,
they generate finite-sized structures with a characteristic size proportional
to both the self-propulsion velocity and the inverse of the self-rotation
frequency. Our results show that a general mechanism might explain why
chirality tends to suppress motility-induced phase separation but instead
promotes the formation of non-equilibrium patterns.

<h3>Active orbital degree of freedom and potential spin-orbit-entangled moments in Kitaev magnet candidate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$</h3>

Candidate materials for Kitaev spin liquid phase have been intensively
studied recently because of their potential applications in fault-tolerant
quantum computing. Although most of the studies on Kitaev spin liquid have been
done in 4$d$ and 5$d$ based transition metal compounds, recently there has been
a growing research interest in Co-based quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb
magnets, such as BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ because of formation of
spin-orbit-entangled $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 pseudospin moments at Co$^{2+}$ sites
and potential realizations of Kitaev-like magnetism therein. Here, we obtain
high-accuracy crystal and electronic structure of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ by
employing a combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory
calculations, which correctly capture the Mott-insulating nature of the target
system. We show that Co$^{2+}$ ions form a high spin configuration, $S=3/2$,
with an active $L_{\rm eff}=1$ orbital degree of freedom, in the absence of
spin-orbit coupling. The size of trigonal distortion within CoO$_6$ octahedra
is found to be not strong enough to completely quench the orbital degree of
freedom, so that the presence of spin-orbit coupling can give rise to the
formation of spin-orbit-entangled moments and the Kitaev exchange interaction.
Our finding supports recent studies on potential Kitaev magnetism in this
compound and other Co-based layered honeycomb systems.
