<h3>Cavity optomechanical detection of persistent currents and solitons in a  bosonic ring condensate</h3>

We present numerical simulations of the cavity optomechanical detection of
persistent currents and bright solitons in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
confined in a ring trap. This work describes a novel technique that measures
condensate rotation in situ, in real-time, and with minimal destruction, in
contrast to currently used methods, all of which destroy the condensate
completely. For weakly repulsive inter-atomic interactions, the analysis of
persistent currents extends our previous few-mode treatment of the condensate
[P. Kumar et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 113601 (2021)] to a stochastic
Gross-Pitaevskii simulation. For weakly attractive atomic interactions, we
present the first analysis of optomechanical detection of matter-wave soliton
motion. We provide optical cavity transmission spectra containing signatures of
the condensate rotation, sensitivity as a function of the system response
frequency, and atomic density profiles quantifying the effect of the
measurement backaction on the condensate. We treat the atoms at a mean-field
level and the optical field classically, account for damping and noise in both
degrees of freedom, and investigate the linear as well as nonlinear response of
the configuration. Our results are consequential for the characterization of
rotating matter waves in studies of atomtronics, superfluid hydrodynamics, and
matter-wave soliton interferometry.

<h3>A Hydrodynamical Description of Bose Liquid with Fractional Exclusion  Statistics</h3>

Hydrodynamical systems are usually taken as chaotic systems with fast
relaxations. It is counter intuitive for "ideal" gas to have a hydrodynamical
description. We find that a hydrodynamical model of one-dimensional $|\Phi|^6$
theory shares the same ground state density profile, density-wave excitation,
as well as the similar dynamical and statistical properties with the
Calogero-Sutherland model in thermodynamic limit when their interaction
strengths matches each other. The interaction strength g0 in the
$|\Phi|^6$theory is then the index of fractional statistics. Although the model
is interacting in Bose liquid sense, but it shows integrability with periodical
coherent evolution. We also discussed the fractional statistics emerges from
the $|\Phi|^6$ theory.

Motility is a fundamental feature of living matter, encompassing single cells
and collective behavior. Such living systems are characterized by
non-conservativity of energy and a large diversity of spatio-temporal patterns.
Thus, fundamental physical principles to formulate their behavior are not yet
fully understood. This study explores a violation of Newton's third law in
motile active agents, by considering non-reciprocal mechanical interactions
known as odd elasticity. By extending the description of odd elasticity to a
nonlinear regime, we present a general framework for the swimming dynamics of
active elastic materials in low-Reynolds-number fluids, such as wave-like
patterns observed in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. We investigate the
non-local interactions within a swimmer using generalized material elasticity
and apply these concepts to biological flagellar motion. Through simple
solvable models and the analysis of {\it Chlamydomonas} flagella waveforms and
experimental data for human sperm, we demonstrate the wide applicability of a
non-local and non-reciprocal description of internal interactions within living
materials in viscous fluids, offering a unified framework for active and living
matter physics.

<h3>Nonadiabatic dynamics near metal surfaces under Floquet engineering:  Floquet electronic friction vs. Floquet surface hopping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06128" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06128</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Wang, Wenjie Dou</i>
<br>
<br>
In the previous study (arXiv:2303.00479), we have derived a Floquet classical
master equation (FCME) to treat nonadiabatic dynamics near metal surfaces under
Floquet engineering. We have also proposed trajectory surface hopping algorithm
to solve the FCME. In this study, we map the FCME into a Floquet Fokker-Planck
equation in the limit of fast Floquet driving and fast electron motion as
compared to nuclear motion. The Fokker-Planck equation is then being solved
using Langevin dynamics with explicit friction and random force from the
nonadiabatic effects of hybridized electron and Floquet states. We benchmark
the Floquet electronic friction (FEF) dynamics against Floquet quantum master
equation (FQME) and Floquet surface hopping (FSH). We find that Floquet driving
results in violation of the second fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which
further gives rise to heating effects.

<h3>Design of quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices and domain walls  supporting bound states</h3>

We study the simplest Lam\'e magnetic superlattice in graphene, finding its
allowed and forbidden energy bands and band-edge states explicitly. Then, we
design quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices supporting bound states using
Darboux transformations. This technique enables us to add any finite number of
bound states, which we exemplify with the most straightforward cases of one and
two bound states in the designed spectrum. The topics of magnetic superlattices
and domain walls in gapped graphene turn out to be connected by a unitary
transformation in the limit of significantly large oscillation periods. We show
that the generated quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices are also linked to
domain walls, with the bound states keeping their nature in such a limit.

<h3>Quantum Hall Effect in a Weyl-Hubbard Model: Interplay between Topology  and Correlation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06183" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06183</a>

<br>
<br>
The interplay between topology and electronic correlation effects offers a
rich avenue for discovering emergent quantum phenomena in condensed matter
systems. In this work, starting from the Weyl-Hubbard model, we investigate the
quantum Hall effect to explore the consequence of onsite Hubbard repulsion on
nontrivial Weyl band topology in the presence of an external magnetic field.
Within the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction method, we find the system to
undergo multiple topological phase transitions, including two distinct Weyl
phases with a different number of Weyl node pairs and a trivial narrow band
insulator, by tuning on-site Coulomb interaction. Interestingly, these two Weyl
phases can be identified by the sign of their chiral Landau levels. The
possible experimental signature of these topological phases and correlation
effects is provided by the magnetic-field dependent quantum Hall conductivity
within the Kubo response theory.

<h3>Geometric clusters in the overlap of the Ising model</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the percolation properties of geometrical clusters defined in the
overlap space of two statistically independent replicas of a square-lattice
Ising model that are simulated at the same temperature. In particular, we
consider two distinct types of clusters in the overlap, which we dub soft- and
hard-constraint clusters, and which are subsets of the regions of constant spin
overlap. By means of Monte Carlo simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis
we estimate the transition temperature as well as the set of critical exponents
characterizing the percolation transitions undergone by these two cluster
types. The results suggest that both soft- and hard-constraint clusters
percolate at the critical temperature of the Ising model and their critical
behavior is governed by the correlation-length exponent $\nu = 1$ found by
Onsager. At the same time, they exhibit non-standard and distinct sets of
exponents for the average cluster size and percolation strength.

<h3>Dangling bonds as possible contributors to charge noise in silicon and  silicon-germanium quantum dot qubits</h3>

Spin qubits based on Si and Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$ quantum dot architectures
exhibit among the best coherence times of competing quantum computing
technologies, yet they still suffer from charge noise that limit their qubit
gate fidelities. Identifying the origins of these charge fluctuations is
therefore a critical step toward improving Si quantum-dot-based qubits. Here we
use hybrid functional calculations to investigate possible atomistic sources of
charge noise, focusing on charge trapping at Si and Ge dangling bonds (DBs). We
evaluate the role of global and local environment in the defect levels
associated with DBs in Si, Ge, and \sige alloys, and consider their trapping
and excitation energies within the framework of configuration coordinate
diagrams. We additionally consider the influence of strain and oxidation in
charge-trapping energetics by analyzing Si and Ge$_{\rm Si}$ DBs in SiO$_2$ and
strained Si layers in typical \sige quantum dot heterostructures. Our results
identify that Ge dangling bonds are more problematic charge-trapping centers
both in typical \sige alloys and associated oxidation layers, and they may be
exacerbated by compositional inhomogeneities. These results suggest the
importance of alloy homogeneity and possible passivation schemes for DBs in
Si-based quantum dot qubits and are of general relevance to mitigating possible
trap levels in other Si, Ge, and Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$-based
metal-oxide-semiconductor stacks and related devices.

Motivated by scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments on AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A =
Cs, Rb, K) that revealed periodic real-space modulation of electronic states at
low energies, I show using model calculations that a tripple-$\bf Q$ chiral
pair density wave (CPDW) is generated in the superconducting state by a charge
order of $2a\! \times \!2a$ superlattice periodicity, intertwined with a
time-reversal symmetry breaking orbital loop current. The CPDW correlation
survives even when the long-range superconducting phase coherence is diminished
by a magnetic field or temperature. The superconducting critical field is
enhanced beyond the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit, pointing to a rare quantum
state above the superconducting transition. The presented results suggest that
the CPDW can be regarded as the origin of the pseudogap observed near the
superconducting transition.

Within the method of spectral moments it is possible to construct the
spectral function of a many-electron system from the first $2P$ spectral
moments ($P=1,2,3,\dots$). The case $P=1$ corresponds to standard Kohn-Sham
density functional theory (KS-DFT). Taking $P>1$ allows us to consider
additional important properties of the uniform electron gas (UEG) in the
construction of suitable moment potentials for moment-functional based spectral
density-functional theory (MFbSDFT). For example, the quasiparticle
renormalization factor $Z$, which is not explicitly considered in KS-DFT, can
be included easily. In the 4-pole approximation of the spectral function of the
UEG (corresponding to $P=4$) we can reproduce the momentum distribution, the
second spectral moment, and the charge response acceptably well, while a
treatment of the UEG by KS-DFT reproduces from these properties only the charge
response. For weakly and moderately correlated systems we may reproduce the
most important aspects of the 4-pole approximation by an optimized two-pole
model, which leaves away the low-energy satellite band. From the optimized
two-pole model we extract \textit{parameter-free universal} moment potentials
for MFbSDFT, which improve the description of the bandgaps in Si, SiC, BN, MgO,
CaO, and ZnO significantly.

<h3>Self-consistent on-site and inter-site Hubbard parameters within DFT+U+V  for UO$_2$ using density-functional perturbation theory</h3>

To apply the Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory for predicting some
known materials' properties, the Hubbard parameters are usually so tuned that
the calculations give results in agreement with some experimental data and then
one uses the tuned model to predict unknown properties. However, in designing
new unknown novel materials there is no data to fit the parameters and
therefore self-consistent determination of these parameters is crucial. In this
work, using the new method formulated by others, which is based on
density-functional perturbation theory, we have calculated self-consistently
the Hubbard parameters for UO$_2$ crystal within different popular
exchange-correlation approximations. The calculated ground-state lattice
constants and electronic band-gaps are compared with experiment and shown that
PBE-sol lead to results in best agreement with experiment.

Polycrystalline boron-doped diamond (BDD) is widely used as a working
electrode material in electrochemistry, and its properties, such as its
stability, make it an appealing support material for nanostructures for
electrocatalytic applications. Recent experiments have shown that
electrodeposition can lead to the creation of stable small nanoclusters and
even single metal adatoms on BDD surfaces. We investigate the adsorption energy
and kinetic stability of single metal atoms adsorbed onto an atomistic model of
BDD surfaces using density functional theory. The surface model is constructed
using hybrid quantum/molecular mechanics embedding techniques and is based on
an oxygen-terminated diamond (110) surface. We use the hybrid quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics method to assess the ability of different
density-functional approximations to predict the adsorption structure, energy
and the barrier for diffusion on pristine and defective surfaces. We find that
surface defects (vacancies and surface dopants) strongly anchor metal adatoms
on vacancy sites. We further investigate the thermal stability of metal
adatoms, which reveals high barriers associated with lateral diffusion away
from the vacancy site. The result provides an explanation for the high
stability of experimentally imaged single metal adatoms on BDD and a starting
point to investigate the early stages of nucleation during metal surface
deposition.

Chemistry and materials science are complex. Recently, there have been great
successes in addressing this complexity using data-driven or computational
techniques. Yet, the necessity of input structured in very specific forms and
the fact that there is an ever-growing number of tools creates usability and
accessibility challenges. Coupled with the reality that much data in these
disciplines is unstructured, the effectiveness of these tools is limited.
Motivated by recent works that indicated that large language models (LLMs)
might help address some of these issues, we organized a hackathon event on the
applications of LLMs in chemistry, materials science, and beyond. This article
chronicles the projects built as part of this hackathon. Participants employed
LLMs for various applications, including predicting properties of molecules and
materials, designing novel interfaces for tools, extracting knowledge from
unstructured data, and developing new educational applications.
The diverse topics and the fact that working prototypes could be generated in
less than two days highlight that LLMs will profoundly impact the future of our
fields. The rich collection of ideas and projects also indicates that the
applications of LLMs are not limited to materials science and chemistry but
offer potential benefits to a wide range of scientific disciplines.

<h3>On-site and inter-site Hubbard corrections in magnetic monolayers: The  case of FePS$_3$ and CrI$_3$</h3>

Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory has proven to be successful in
addressing self-interaction errors in 3D magnetic materials. However, the
effectiveness of this approach for 2D magnetic materials has not been
extensively explored. Here, we use PBEsol+$\textit{U}$ and its extensions
PBEsol+$\textit{U}$+$\textit{V}$ to investigate the electronic, structural, and
vibrational properties of 2D antiferromagnetic FePS$_3$ and ferromagnetic
CrI$_3$, and compare the monolayers with their bulk counterparts. Hubbard
parameters (on-site $\textit{U}$ and inter-site $\textit{V}$) are computed
self-consistently using density-functional perturbation theory, thus avoiding
any empirical assumptions. We show that for FePS$_3$ the Hubbard corrections
are crucial in obtaining the experimentally observed insulating state with the
correct crystal symmetry, providing also vibrational frequencies in good
agreement with Raman experiments. For ferromagnetic CrI$_3$, we discuss how a
straightforward application of Hubbard corrections worsens the results and
introduces a spurious separation between spin-majority and minority conduction
bands. Promoting the Hubbard $\textit{U}$ to be a spin-resolved parameter -
that is, applying different (first-principles) values to the spin-up and
spin-down manifolds - recovers a more physical picture of the electronic bands
and delivers the best comparison with experiments.

The recent report of superconductivity in nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride at
near-ambient pressures and temperatures has attracted great attention but also
continuing controversy. Several experimental groups have reported no
observation of superconductivity at these conditions in Lu-N-H samples they
have prepared. To address this issue, we have carried out a series of studies
of phases in the Lu-N-H system using a variety of techniques. We report here
electrical resistance measurements on a Lu-N-H sample that are in very good
agreement with both previously reported Tc and its pressure dependence in the
vicinity of room temperature for nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride.

Control of excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and their
heterostructures is fundamentally interesting for tailoring light-matter
interactions and exploring their potential applications in high-efficiency
optoelectronic and nonlinear photonic devices. While both intra- and interlayer
excitons in TMDCs have been heavily studied, their behavior in the quantum
tunneling regime, in which the TMDC or its heterostructure is optically excited
and concurrently serves as a tunnel junction barrier, remains unexplored. Here,
using the degree of freedom of a metallic probe in an atomic force microscope,
we investigated both intralayer and interlayer excitons dynamics in TMDC
heterobilayers via locally controlled junction current in a finely tuned
sub-nanometer tip-sample cavity. Our tip-enhanced photoluminescence
measurements reveal a significantly different exciton-quantum plasmon coupling
for intralayer and interlayer excitons due to different orientation of the
dipoles of the respective e-h pairs. Using a steady-state rate equation fit, we
extracted field gradients, radiative and nonradiative relaxation rates for
excitons in the quantum tunneling regime with and without junction current. Our
results show that tip-induced radiative (nonradiative) relaxation of intralayer
(interlayer) excitons becomes dominant in the quantum tunneling regime due to
the Purcell effect. These findings have important implications for near-field
probing of excitonic materials in the strong-coupling regime.

<h3>The Central Role of Tilted Anisotropy for Field-Free Spin-Orbit Torque  Switching of Perpendicular Magnetization</h3>

The discovery of efficient magnetization switching activated by the spin Hall
effect (SHE)-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) changed the course of magnetic
random-access memory (MRAM) research and development. However, for systems with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), the use of SOT is still hampered by
the necessity of a longitudinal magnetic field to break the magnetic symmetry
to achieve deterministic switching. In this work, we first demonstrate that a
robust and tunable field-free current-driven SOT switching of perpendicular
magnetization can be controlled by the growth protocol in Pt-based magnetic
heterostructures. It is further elucidated that such growth-dependent symmetry
breaking is originated from the laterally tilted magnetic anisotropy of the
ferromagnetic layer with PMA, which has been largely neglected in previous
studies and its critical role should be re-focused. We show by both experiments
and simulations that in a PMA system with tilted anisotropy, the deterministic
field-free switching possesses a conventional SHE-induced damping-like torque
feature and the resulting current-induced effective field has a non-linear
dependence on the applied current density, which could be potentially
misattributed to an unconventional SOT origin.

The presence of defects in solids formed by active particles breaks their
discrete translational symmetry. As a consequence, many of their properties
become space-dependent and different from those characterizing perfectly
ordered structures. Motivated by recent numerical investigations concerning the
nonuniform distribution of entropy production and its relation to the
configurational properties of active systems, we study theoretically and
numerically the spatial profile of the entropy production rate when an active
solid contains an isotopic mass defect. The theoretical study of such an
imperfect active crystal is conducted by employing a perturbative analysis that
considers the perfectly ordered harmonic solid as a reference system. The
perturbation theory predicts a nonuniform profile of the entropy production
extending over large distances from the position of the impurity. The entropy
production rate decays exponentially to its bulk value with a typical healing
length that coincides with the correlation length of the spatial velocity
correlations characterizing the perfect active solids in the absence of
impurities. The theory is validated against numerical simulations of an active

High prospects for different optoelectronic applications have drawn much
effort towards hybrid double perovskites for the commercialization of
environmentally friendly Pb-free non-toxic perovskites. Herein, the
optoelectronic study of (MA)2NaBiX6 (MA= methylammonium; X=Cl,Br, I) hybrid
double perovskites by ab initio simulation was investigated. (MA)2NaBiBr6 and
(MA)2NaBiCl6 have indirect X-M bandgaps while (MA)2NaBiI6 have indirect X-
{\Gamma} bandgap of 2.98 eV, 3.64 eV and 2.32 eV respectively. The results also
show that the iodide-based compound, (MA)2NaBiI6 exhibits superior
optoelectronic properties compared to the bromide and chloride-based compounds,
(MA)2NaBiBr6 and (MA)2NaBiCl6. These findings indicate that the (MA)2NaBiI6
hybrid double perovskite is a potential material for optoelectronic
applications owing to its high absorption coefficient (on the order of
106cm-1), dielectric constant (approx.3.34), and refractive index (2.50) in
addition to its high formation energy, which shows its stability.

<h3>Dynamical mean field theory for models of confluent tissues and beyond</h3>

<br>
<i>Persia Jana Kamali, Pierfrancesco Urbani</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a recently proposed model to understand the rigidity transition
in confluent tissues and we study its dynamical behavior under several types of
dynamics: gradient descent, thermal Langevin noise and active drive. We derive
the dynamical mean field theory equations and integrate them numerically and
compare the results with numerical simulations. In particular we focus on
gradient descent dynamics and show that this algorithm is blind to the zero
temperature replica symmetry breaking (RSB) transition point. In other words,
even if the Gibbs measure at zero temperature is RSB, the algorithm is able to
find its way to a zero energy configuration. This is somehow expected and
agrees with previous findings in numerical simulations on other examples of
continuous constraint satisfaction problems. Our results can be also
straightforwardly applied to the study of high-dimensional regression tasks
where the fitting functions are non-linear functions of a set of weights found
via the optimization of the square loss.

<h3>Statistical Analysis of Magnetic Domain Wall Dynamics to Quantify  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction</h3>

<br>
<br>
We utilize statistical tools to analyze the magnetic domain wall dynamics in
a nanostrip, which can quantify the magnitude and reveal the effects of
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Mariya interaction. We find that there exist two
peaks in the velocity frequency spectrum, the magnitude ratio of which can be
used to determine the DMI strength. Our approach is validated using a
collective-coordinate model, and is demonstrated to be robust against thermal
noise and material impurities. Moreover, third-order cumulant and third-order
time-dependent correlation function of velocity are calculated and yield
valuable information regarding the asymmetry induced by DMI. Our findings offer
novel and efficient analysis tools to understand physical process of domain
wall dynamics under DMI and exotic magnetic phenomena.

<br>
<br>
Dislocation patterning and self-organization during plastic deformation are
associated with work hardening, but the exact mechanisms remain elusive. This
is partly because studies of the structure and local strain during the initial
stages of plastic deformation has been a challenge. Here we use Dark Field
X-ray Microscopy to generate 3D maps of embedded $350 \times 900 \times 72
\,\mu\mathrm{m}^3$ volumes within three pure Al single crystals, all oriented
for double slip on the primary and conjugate slip systems. These were tensile
deformed by 0.6$\%$, 1.7$\%$ and 3.6$\%$, respectively. Orientation maps
revealed the existence of two distinct types of planar dislocation boundaries
both at 0.6$\%$ and 1.7$\%$ but no systematic patterning. At 3.6$\%$, these
boundaries have evolved into a well-defined checkerboard pattern,
characteristic of Geometrically Necessary Boundaries, GNBs. The GNB spacing is
$\approx$ 14 $\mu$m and the misorientation $\approx$ 0.2{\deg}, in fair
agreement with those at higher strains. By contrast to the sharp boundaries
observed at higher strains, the boundaries are associated with a sinusoidal
orientation gradient. Maps of the elastic strain along the (111) direction
exhibit fluctuations of $\pm 0.0002 $ with an average domain size of 3 $\mu$m.

Machine-learned interatomic potentials are fast becoming an indispensable
tool in computational materials science. One approach is the ephemeral
data-derived potential (EDDP), which was designed to accelerate atomistic
structure prediction. The EDDP is simple and cost-efficient. It relies on
training data generated in small unit cells and is fit using a lightweight
neural network, leading to smooth interactions which exhibit the robust
transferability essential for structure prediction. Here, we present a variety
of applications of EDDPs, enabled by recent developments of the open-source
EDDP software. New features include interfaces to phonon and molecular dynamics
codes, as well as deployment of the ensemble deviation for estimating the
confidence in EDDP predictions. Through case studies ranging from elemental
carbon and lead to the binary scandium hydride and the ternary zinc cyanide, we
demonstrate that EDDPs can be trained to cover wide ranges of pressures and
stoichiometries, and used to evaluate phonons, phase diagrams, superionicity,
and thermal expansion. These developments complement continued success in
accelerated structure prediction.

<br>

In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the wave packet traveling
through a porous semiconductor channel, with the defects being simulated by a
disordered scattering region produced by obstruction potentials. The
theoretical framework is based on the $split-operator$ technique to solve the
time-dependent Schr$\"o$dinger equation within the effective mass
approximation. In our simulation, we consider the semiconductor channel made by
InGaAs with a width of 100 angstrom, growth on an InAlAs substrate, and the
porous ones with circular symmetry and different densities. The results for the
current probability density and reflection, and transmission coefficients are
analyzed for different initial values of the kinetic energy of the Gaussian
wave packet, disordered pore densities, and pore randomness.

<h3>Rapidly Screening the Correlation Between the Rotational Mobility and  the Hydrogen Bonding Strength of Confined Water</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06571" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06571</a>

Past research has conclusively shown that confined pockets of water exhibit
properties that differ from those of unconfined ("bulk") water. The differences
between confined water and bulk, as well as between different types of confined
water environments impact a far-reaching range of target applications. However,
the measurements that discriminate between different variants of confined water
tend to rely on sophisticated techniques that frequently involve specialized
instrumentation or facilities. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward and
automated technique compatible with most NMR spectrometers that can analyze a
wide range of nanoporous or mesoporous systems. It generates a 2D plot that
correlates the approximate rotational correlation time (from deuterium
relaxation measurements) against the approximate average hydrogen bond strength
(from the diamagnetic shielding, i.e., chemical shift).
The water pools inside reverse micelles (RMs), chosen here as a demonstration
system, exhibit a range of properties as the water loading ($w_0$, or water to
surfactant molar ratio) changes. Small $w_0$ correspond to severe confinement
(isolation of tens to hundreds of water molecules), and as the $w_0$ increases,
the RMs grow in size. As a result, measurements of RMs with differently sized
water pools ($w_0$) sweep out a characteristic shape in the 2D correlation
spectrum.
This simple, automated measurement demonstrates striking differences in how
the properties of differently confined waters change as the lengthscale of the
confinement (controlled in RMs by $w_0$) changes. The results here report on a
total of 45 different RM samples prepared with a range of $w_0$, surfactants,
dispersants, and guest molecules. This technique should be widely applicable
both in terms of facilities where it can be implemented as well as chemical
systems to which it applies.

The design of specified nonlinear mechanical responses into a structure or
material is a highly sought after capability, which would have a significant
impact in areas such as wave tailoring in metamaterials, impact mitigation,
soft robotics, and biomedicine. Here, we present a topology optimization
approach to design structures for desired nonlinear behavior, wherein we
formulate the problem in such a way as to decouple the nonlinear response from
the stiffness. We show results across different classes of nonlinearity while
achieving a high degree of precision. The approach enables access to previously
difficult to design for, or hitherto unachieved, nonlinear behavior via
optimized structures, which can furthermore be incorporated as unit cells of
designer materials with tailored nonlinear properties.

Ising machines have the potential to realize fast and highly accurate solvers
for combinatorial optimization problems. They are classified based on their
internal algorithms. Examples include simulated-annealing-based Ising machines
(non-quantum-type Ising machines) and quantum-annealing-based Ising machines
(quantum annealers). Herein we propose a hybrid optimization method, which
utilizes the advantages of both types. In this hybrid optimization method, the
preprocessing step is performed by solving the non-quantum-annealing Ising
machine multiple times. Then sub-Ising models with a reduced size by spin
fixing are solved using a quantum annealer. The performance of the hybrid
optimization method is evaluated via simulations using Simulated Annealing (SA)
as a non-quantum-type Ising machine and D-Wave Advantage as a quantum annealer.
Additionally, we investigate the parameter dependence of the proposed hybrid
optimization method. The hybrid optimization method outperforms the
preprocessing SA and the quantum annealing machine alone in fully connected
random Ising models.

<br>
Polymer ejection from nano-confinement has been of interest due to its
relation to various fundamental sciences and applications. However, the
ejection dynamics of a polymer with different persistence lengths from
confinement through a nanopore is still poorly understood. In this manuscript,
a theory is developed for the ejection dynamics of a polymer with the total
length $L_0$ and persistence length $l$ from a sphere of diameter $D$. These
length-scales specify different regimes, which determine the polymer dynamics
and its ejection rate. It is seen that the polymer undergoes between two to
three confinement regimes, in some cases. The total ejection time $\tau$
depends on the polymer dynamics in various relevant regimes that the polymer
experiences. Dependence of the ejection time on the system parameters is
discussed according to the theory. The theory predicts that $\alpha$ in $\tau
\sim L_0^{\alpha}$ changes between 1 and 1.7, $\beta$ in $\tau \sim D^{\beta}$
changes between 3 and 5, and $\gamma$ in $\tau \sim l^{\gamma}$ is often
smaller than 1, in the studied range of the parameters.

Polaritons are quasiparticles resulting from strong quantum coupling of light
and matter. Peculiar properties of polaritons are a mixture of physics usually
restricted to one of these realms, making them interesting for study not only
from the fundamental point of view but also for applications. In recent years,
many studies have been devoted to the potential use of exciton-polaritons for
computing. Very recently, it has been shown experimentally that they can be
harnessed not only for digital computing, but also for optical neural networks
and for optimization related to hard computational problems. Here, we provide a
brief review of recent studies and most important results in this area. We
focus our attention in particular on the emerging concepts of non-von-Neumann
computing schemes and their realizations in exciton-polariton systems.

<i>Somnath Paramanick, Arnab Pal, Harsh Soni, Nitin Kumar</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a scheme for producing tunable active dynamics in a self-propelled
robotic device. The robot moves using the differential drive mechanism where
two wheels can vary their instantaneous velocities independently. This velocity
data is first calculated by equating its equations of motion in two dimensions
with well-established active particle models and later encoded into the robot's
microcontroller. We demonstrate that the robot can depict active Brownian, run
and tumble, and Brownian dynamics with a wide range of parameters. The
resulting motion analyzed using particle tracking shows excellent agreement
with the theoretically predicted trajectories. Moreover, as a function of
external signals received through hardware components like light intensity and
infrared sensors, the robot can modify its dynamics providing spatiotemporal
control over its motion. We demonstrate our claims with an experiment where the
robot searches for an object and brings it back to its origin point,
reminiscent of foraging and homing behaviour observed in living organisms. This
work opens an avenue for designing tunable active systems with the potential of
revealing the physics of active matter and its application for bio- and
nature-inspired robotics.

A wide class of materials with different crystal and electronic structures
from quasi-two-dimensional unconventional superconductors (cuprates,
nickelates, ferropnictides/chalcogenides, ruthenate SrRuO$_4$), 3D systems as
manganites RMnO$_3$, ferrates (CaSr)FeO$_3$, nickelates RNiO$_3$, to silver
oxide AgO are based on Jahn-Teller $3d$ and $4d$ ions. These unusual materials
called Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets are characterized by an extremely rich variety
of phase states from non-magnetic and magnetic insulators to unusual metallic
and superconducting states. The unconventional properties of the JT-magnets can
be related to the instability of their highly symmetric Jahn-Teller
"progenitors" with the ground orbital $E$-state to charge transfer with
anti-Jahn-Teller $d$-$d$ disproportionation and the formation of a system of
effective local composite spin-singlet or spin-triplet, electronic or hole
$S$-type bosons moving in a non-magnetic or magnetic lattice. We consider
specific features of the anti-JT-disproportionation reaction, properties of the
electron-hole dimers, possible phase states of JT-magnets, effective
Hamiltonians for single- and two-band JT-magnets, and present a short overview
of physical properties for actual JT-magnets.

<h3>Surface Magnetization in Antiferromagnets: Classification, example  materials, and relation to magnetoelectric responses</h3>

We use symmetry analysis and density functional theory to characterize
antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials which have a finite equilibrium magnetization
density on particular surface terminations. A nonzero magnetic dipole moment
per unit area or "surface magnetization" can arise on particular surfaces of
many AFMs due to the bulk magnetic symmetries. Such surface magnetization plays
an essential role in numerous device applications, from random-access
magnetoelectric (ME) memory to exchange bias. However, at this point a
universal description of AFM surface magnetization is lacking. We first
introduce a classification system based on whether the surface magnetization is
sensitive or robust to roughness, and on whether the surface of interest is
magnetically compensated or uncompensated in the bulk magnetic ground state. We
show that uncompensated surface magnetization can be conveniently described in
terms of ME multipoles at the local-moment, unit cell level, and demonstrate
that the symmetry of the multivalued "multipolization lattice" distinguishes
between roughness-robust and roughness-sensitive surface magnetization. We then
demonstrate that magnetization on bulk-compensated surfaces arises due to ME
multipoles (in addition to higher-order magnetic terms) at the atomic site
level. These can further be understood in terms of bulk ME responses, arising
from the effective electric field resulting from the surface termination. We
also show with density functional calculations that nominally compensated
surfaces in Cr2O3 and FeF2 develop a finite magnetization density at the
surface, in agreement with our predictions based on both group theory and the
linear and higher-order ME response tensors. Our analysis provides a
comprehensive basis for understanding the surface magnetic properties in AFMs,
and has important implications for phenomena such as exchange bias coupling.

We study the spreading of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) droplets under surface
tension effects. The non- Newtonian material flows like a viscoelastic liquid
above the yield stress and behaves like a viscoelastic solid below it. Hence,
the droplet initially flows under surface tension forces but eventually reaches
a final equilibrium shape when the stress everywhere inside the droplet falls
below the resisting rheological stresses. We use numerical simulations and
combine Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method and an EVP constitutive model to
systematically study the dynamics of spreading and the final shape of the
droplets. The spreading process examined in this study finds applications in
coating, droplet-based inkjet printing, and 3D printing, where complex fluids
such as paints, thermoplastic filaments, or bio-inks are deposited onto
surfaces. Additionally, the computational framework enables the study of a wide
range of multiphase interfacial phenomena, from elastocapillarity to
plastocapillarity.

Focused-electron-beam-induced deposition is a promising technique for
patterning nanomagnets for spin qubit control in a single step. We fabricate
cobalt nanomagnets in such a process, obtaining cobalt contents and saturation
magnetizations comparable to or higher than those typically obtained using
electron-beam lithography. We characterize the nanomagnets using transmission
electron microscopy and image their stray magnetic field using scanning NV
magnetometry, finding good agreement with micromagnetic simulations. The
magnetometry reveals the presence of magnetic domains and halo side-deposits,
which are common for this fabrication technique. Finally, we estimate dephasing
times for electron spin qubits in the presence of disordered stray fields due
to these side-deposits.

The co-existence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity becomes possible
through unconventional pairing in the superconducting state. Such materials are
exceedingly rare in solid-state systems but are promising platforms to explore
topological phases, such as Majorana bound states. Theoretical investigations
date back to the late 1950s, but only a few systems have so far been
experimentally identified as potential hosts. Here, we show that
atomically-thin niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) intercalated with dilute cobalt
atoms spontaneously displays ferromagnetism below the superconducting
transition temperature ($T_c$). We elucidate the origin of this phase by
constructing a magnetic tunnel junction that consists of cobalt and
cobalt-doped niobium diselenide (Co-NbSe$_2$) as the two ferromagnetic
electrodes, with an ultra-thin boron nitride as the tunnelling barrier. At a
temperature well below $T_c$, the tunnelling magnetoresistance shows a bistable
state, suggesting a ferromagnetic order in Co-NbSe$_2$. We propose a RKKY
exchange coupling mechanism based on the spin-triplet superconducting order
parameter to mediate such ferromagnetism. We further perform non-local lateral
spin valve measurements to confirm the origin of the ferromagnetism. The
observation of Hanle precession signals show spin diffusion length up to
micrometres below Tc, demonstrating an intrinsic spin-triplet nature in
superconducting NbSe$_2$. Our discovery of superconductivity-mediated
ferromagnetism opens the door to an alternative design of ferromagnetic
superconductors

<h3>Strain and spin orbit coupling effects on electronic and optical  properties of 2D CX/graphene (X = S, Se, Te) vdW heterostructure for solar  energy harvesting</h3>

Vertically stacked two-dimensional (2D) graphene-based van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructures have emerged as the technological materials for electronic and
optoelectronic device applications. In this regard, for the first time, we
systematically predicted the electronic and optical properties of CX/G (X = S,
Se and Te; G = graphene) heterostructures under biaxial strain and spin orbit
coupling (SOC) by first-principles calculations. Strain is induced by applying
mechanical stress to the heterostructures, while SOC arises due to the
interaction between the electron spin and its orbital motion. The electronic
property calculations reveal that all three heterostructures exhibit indirect
semiconducting nature with a narrow bandgap of 0.47-0.62 eV and remain indirect
under compressive and tensile strains. Strong band splitting of 78.4 meV has
been observed in the conduction band edge of CTe/G heterostructure in the
presence of SOC due to the lack of an inversion center attributed to the large
hole effective mass. Under compressive strain, the p-type of Schottky contact
of CX/G heterostructures is converted into p-type Ohmic contact because of
nearly negligible Schottky barrier height. Further, the optical property
assessment reveals red and blue shifts in the absorption peak of CX/G
heterostructures with regard to tensile and compressive strains, respectively.
Despite this, the CTe/G heterostructure achieves a remarkable high {\eta} of
24.53% in the strain-free case whereas, it reaches to 28.31% with 4%
compressive strain, demonstrating the potential for solar energy conversion
device applications. Our findings suggest that CX/G heterostructures could be
promising candidates for high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study the magnetic
susceptibility in the parameter space of the on-site interaction $U$,
temperature $T$, electron filling $\avg{n}$, and the frustration control
parameter $t^{\prime}$ within the Hubbard model on a two-dimensional
checkerboard lattice. It is shown that the system exhibits stable and strong
ferromagnetic fluctuations about the electron filling $\avg{n}\ge1.2$ for
different $t^{\prime}$, and the ferromagnetic susceptibility is strongly
enhanced by the increasing interaction and decreasing tempeture. We also
discuss the sign problem to clarify which parameter region is accessible and
reliable. Our findings not only demonstrate important implications for
modulating magnetism in the checkerboard lattice, but will also provide a
theoretical platform for a flat-band model that demonstrates a variety of
physical properties.

Here we demonstrate workably accurate estimation of optical excitation
threshold for large systems comprising of hundreds of atoms through an
anti-causally corrected(ACC) real-time dynamics(RTD) approach implemented in a
minimal tight-binding basis constituted by the directed hybrid atomic Wannier
orbitals. A correction to the Hamiltonian is applied anti-causally at all time
steps to account for electron-hole interaction using the density-density
response function. Minimality of basis and ease of transferability of
parameters to large systems arises from the directed nature of the Wannierized
hybrid basis orbitals used.With self-energy corrected TB parameters evaluated
at the DFT + G 0 W 0 level, the proposed ACC-RTD scheme can be systematically
parametrized to render optical excitation threshold for systems of
experimentally realizable length-scales through inexpensive computation.

The fate of the single particle immersed in and interacting with a bath of
other particles localized in a tilted lattice is investigated. For tilt values
comparable to the tunneling rate a slow-down of the dynamics is observed
without, however, a clear localization of the impurity. For large tilt and
strong interactions the motion of the impurity resembles that in the
Kronig-Penney potential. The dynamics depends on the initial distribution of
tilted bosons. They show delocalized dynamics for a regular, density wave like
distribution and a localization if tilted bosons are randomly distributed.

The existence of rich Fermiology in anomalous metal phase in exotic
superconductors has attracted considerable interests, as exemplified in copper,
iron-based, and intermetallic frustrated kagome-based compounds. A common
feature in these cases is pseudo-gap opening or long-range lattice/electronic
ordering above superconducting critical temperature Tc. As yet developed area
is the potential existence of exotic Fermiology in superconducting transition
metal oxides on a geometrically frustrated lattice. Here, we focus on the
spinel oxide superconductor LiTi2O4, which can be viewed as the hole-doped side
of the orbital ordered 3d1 Mott system on the Ti-derived pyrochlore frustrated
network. By the in-situ combination of angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and epitaxial thin film growth, we discovered the abrupt
flattening of near Fermi energy dispersion below the characteristic temperature
T* ~ 150 K. While the emergent negative thermal expansion below T* strongly
supports a distinct phase at low-temperature, absence of energy gap opening,
splitting/folding of bands, nor long-range lattice distortion are seen across
T*. We propose that the competition between growing instability towards orbital
ordering and its inherent geometric frustration in the Ti-pyrochlore network
results in a new quantum state of matter with robust high entropic nature below
T*. Our findings collectively point to a unique Fermiology in frustrated
three-dimensional transition metal oxides, and its connection to
superconductivity below Tc is open as an interesting future challenge. Also, a
potential guideline is unexpectedly provided for designing zero thermal
expansion metal to develop future solid-state devices.

The spinel oxide superconductor LiTi2O4 (LTO) is an intriguing material
platform where the electronic structure near the Fermi energy (EF) is derived
from 3d elections on the geometrically frustrated Ti pyrochlore network. A
recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study has revealed the
existence of an exotic quasiparticle state arising from the competition between
instability towards orbital ordering and geometrical frustration below 150 K.
An intriguing remaining challenge is the imaging of Abrikosov vortices, which
generally inherits the symmetry of the Fermi surface at k_z=0. Here, we observe
surprising triangular-shaped Abrikosov vortices on an LTO(111) film, deviating
from the conventional expectations of the six-fold symmetric Fermi surface at
k_z=0. In combination with the experimentally observed isotropic pairing, we
propose magnetic field-driven rotational electronic symmetry breaking of the
underlying Fermi surface. Consequently, we observe Josephson vortices along the
crystalline domain boundary, across which quasiparticle hopping is suppressed
due to the symmetry-broken Fermi surface in each domain. Our discoveries point
to the existence of unique physics of magnetic field-induced electronic
rotational symmetry breaking in the spinel oxide superconductor LTO. This
picture is in stark contrast to the other exotic superconductors with partial
gap opening or long-range ordering with broken symmetry above the
superconducting critical temperature at zero magnetic field.

We study the effect of the growth orientation on the structural, electronic,
and hence transport properties of Sr$_2$CoNbO$_6$ thin films grown on the
orthorhombic NGO(100) and cubic MgO(100) substrates. The x-ray diffraction
patterns show the growth of the thin film along $a$-axis resulting in the
asymmetric ($b\neq c$) in-plane compressive strain in case of NGO(100), whereas
along $c$-axis with tensile strain in case of MgO(100) substrate. The
temperature dependent resistivity measurements indicate the lower electronic
conductivity for the film grown on the NGO(100) substrate, which is found to be
correlated with the higher degree of the oxygen deficiencies and hence larger
concentration of the insulating Co$^{2+}$ in this sample. Further, the x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that Sr and Nb are present in the
2+ and 4+ valence state, whereas Co exist in the 2+, 3+ as well as 4+ states,
fraction of which was found to vary with the growth orientation. Moreover, the
analysis of leakage current using the sum exponent model indicate the presence
of two different relaxation mechanisms in these samples.

<h3>Critical behavior in a chiral molecular model</h3>

Understanding the condensed-phase behavior of chiral molecules is important
in biology, as well as in a range of technological applications, such as the
manufacture of pharmaceuticals. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to
study a chiral four-site molecular model that exhibits a second-order
symmetry-breaking phase transition from a supercritical racemic liquid, into
subcritical D-rich and L-rich liquids. We determine the infinite-size critical
temperature using the fourth-order Binder cumulant, and we show that the
finite-size scaling behavior of the order parameter is compatible with the 3D
Ising universality class. We also study the spontaneous D-rich to L-rich
transition at a slightly subcritical temperature $T\approx0.985 T_c$ and our
findings indicate that the free energy barrier for this transformation
increases with system size as $N^{2/3}$ where $N$ is the number of molecules,
consistent with a surface-dominated phenomenon. The critical behavior observed
herein suggests a mechanism for chirality selection in which a liquid of chiral
molecules spontaneously forms a phase enriched in one of the two enantiomers as
the temperature is lowered below the critical point. Furthermore, the
increasing free energy barrier with system size indicates that fluctuations
between the L-rich and D-rich phases are suppressed as the size of the system
increases, trapping it in one of the two enantiomerically-enriched phases. Such
a process could provide the basis for an alternative explanation for the origin
of biological homochirality. We also conjecture the possibility of observing
nucleation at subcritical temperatures under the action of a suitable chiral
external field.

<br>
<br>
We apply quantum electrodynamical density functional theory to obtain the
electronic density, the spin polarization, as well as the orbital and the spin
magnetization of square periodic arrays of quantum dots or antidots subjected
to the influence of a far-infrared cavity photon field. A gradient-based
exchange-correlation functional adapted to a two-dimensional electron gas in a
transverse homogeneous magnetic field is used in the theoretical framework and
calculations. The obtained results predict a non-trivial effect of the cavity
field on the electron distribution in the unit cell of the superlattice, as
well as on the orbital and the spin magnetization. The number of electrons per
unit cell of the superlattice is shown to play a crucial role in the
modification of the magnetization via the electron-photon coupling. The
calculations show that cavity photons strengthen the diamagnetic effect in the
quantum dots structure, while they weaken the paramagnetic effect in an antidot
structure. As the number of electrons per unit cell of the lattice increases
the electron-photon interaction reduces the exchange forces that would
otherwise promote strong spin splitting for both the dot and the antidot array.

Lead-free Ba0.9Sr0.1Ti0.9Sn0.1O3 (BSTSn) ceramic was prepared by the sol gel
method. X-ray diffraction measurement at room temperature reveals the
single-phase formation with tetragonal structure refined in the P4mm space
group. Raman spectroscopy analysis at room temperature was used to confirm the
structure of BSTSn ceramic sintered at 1420C during 5h. The dielectric
measurements were examined in the temperature range [-90 250 C] and the
frequency range of [100Hz 1MHz]. The maximum dielectric constant was found to
be 5484 (1kHz) at room temperature. The diffuse phase transition characteristic
at 1kHz was ascribed by the modified Curie Weiss law. Macroscopic polarization
field (P E) hysteresis loops recorded at room temperature (RT) confirm the
ferroelectric nature of BSTSn ceramic. Impedance spectroscopy analysis of BSTSn
sample in the temperature range 300 380 C reveals the presence of two
relaxation contributions originated from grains and grain boundaries.
Activation energies of grain and grain boundaries resistances were deduced in
order to determine the conduction mechanism of the studied sample.

Perovskite-type Ba0.9Sr0.1Ti0.9Sn0.1O3(BSTSn) ceramic was synthesized by the
sol gel method. The P E hysteresis loops were recorded at different
temperatures to investigate the ferroelectric and energy storage properties of
BSTSn ceramic. Enhanced recoverable energy density and high energy storage
efficiency were found to be 58.08 mJ/cm3 and 84.36 %, respectively at room
temperature (RT) under a moderate applied electric field of 20 kV/cm. The
electrocaloric effect (ECE) in the BSTSn ceramic was explored using two
different approaches based on P E hysteresis loops, and pyroelectric current
measurements. The largest electrocaloric (EC) temperature change of 0.63 K was
determined using the Maxwell relationship obtained near RT under 20 kV/cm. The
corresponding EC responsivity value of 0.31 K.mm/kV is one of the highest
reported values in lead-free ferroelectrics near RT. This study demonstrates
that the BSTSn ceramic is a promising candidate for solid-state cooling and
energy storage applications.

Two dimensional ferroic materials exhibit a variety of functional properties
that can be tuned by temperature and pressure. CuInP2S6 is a layered material
that is ferrielectric at room temperature and whose properties are a result of
the unique structural arrangement of ordered Cu and In cations within a P2S6
anion backbone. Here, we investigate the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the
structure of CuInP2S6 single crystals through a detailed Raman spectroscopy
study. Analysis of the peak frequencies, intensities and widths reveals four
high pressure regimes. At 5 GPa the material undergoes a monoclinic-trigonal
phase transition. At higher pressures (5 - 12 GPa) we see Raman peak
sharpening, indicative of a change in the electronic structure, followed by an
incommensurate phase between 12 - 17 GPa. Above 17 GPa we see evidence for
metallization in the material. The original state of the material is fully
recovered upon decompression, showing that hydrostatic pressure could be used
to tune the electronic and ferrielectric properties of CuInP2S6.

<h3>Temperature Dependence of the Viscoelastic Properties of a Natural  Gastropod Mucus by Brillouin Light Scattering Spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Brillouin spectroscopy was used to probe the viscoelastic properties of a
natural gastropod mucus at GHz frequencies over the range -11 $^\circ$C $\leq T
\leq$ 52 $^\circ$C. Anomalies in the temperature dependence of mucus
longitudinal acoustic mode peak parameters and associated viscoelastic
properties at $T = -2.5^\circ$C, together with the appearance of a peak due to
ice at this temperature, suggest that the mucus undergoes a phase transition
from a viscous liquid state to one in which liquid mucus and solid ice phases
coexist. Failure of this transition to proceed to completion even at -11
$^\circ$C is attributed to glycoprotein-water interaction. The temperature
dependence of the viscoelastic properties and the phase behaviour suggest that
water molecules bind to glycoprotein at a temperature above the onset of
freezing and that the reduced ability of this bound water to take on a
configuration that facilitates freezing is responsible for the observed
freezing point depression and gradual nature of the liquid-solid transition.

<h3>Robust Topological Anderson Insulator Induced Reentrant Localization  Transition</h3>

<br>

We study the topology and localization properties of a generalized
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with a quasi-periodic modulated hopping. It is
found that the interplay of off-diagonal quasi-periodic modulations can induce
topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases and reentrant topological Anderson
insulator (RTAI), and the topological phase boundaries can be uncovered by the
divergence of the localization length of the zero-energy mode. In contrast to
the conventional case that the TAI regime emerges in a finite range with the
increase of disorder, the TAI and RTAI are robust against arbitrary modulation
amplitude for our system. Furthermore, we find that the TAI and RTAI can induce
the emergence of reentrant localization transitions. Such an interesting
connection between the reentrant localization transition and the TAI/RTAI can
be detected from the wave-packet dynamics in cold atom systems by adopting the
technique of momentum-lattice engineering.

<h3>Restoration of non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence by  counterbalancing skin effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06837" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06837</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Xin Xiao, Zhao-Qing Zhang, C. T. Chan</i>
<br>
<br>
The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) undermines the conventional
bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) since it results in a distinct bulk spectrum
in open-boundary systems compared to the periodic counterpart. Using the
non-Hermitian (NH) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, we propose
an intuitive approach, termed ``doubling and swapping" method, to restore the
BBC. Explicitly, we construct a modified system by swapping the asymmetric
intracell hoppings in every second primitive unit cell, such that it has
double-sized unit cells compared to the NH SSH model and is free of NHSE.
Importantly, the modified system and the NH SSH chain exhibit identical spectra
under open boundary conditions (OBC). As a result, the modified system can
serve as the valid bulk for defining topological invariants that correctly
predicts edge states and topological phase transitions. The basic principle is
applicable to many other systems such as the non-Hermitian Creutz ladder model.
Furthermore, we extend the study to disordered systems in which the asymmetric
hoppings are randomly swapped. We show that two types of winding numbers can be
defined to account for the NHSE and topological edge states, respectively.

<h3>Non-zero, symmetric, off-diagonal resistance from rotational symmetry  breaking in a Moire system</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that any two-dimensional system with a non-zero \textit{symmetric}
off-diagonal component of the resistance matrix, $R_{xy}=R_{yx} \neq 0$, must
have the in-plane rotational symmetry broken down to $C_2$. Such a resistance
response is Ohmic, and is different from the Hall response which is the
\textit{anti-symmetric} part of the resistance tensor, $R_{xy}=-R_{yx}$, is
rotationally symmetric in the 2D plane, and requires broken time-reversal
symmetry. We show how a minute amount of strain due to lattice mismatch - less
than $1 \%$ - can produce a vastly exaggerated symmetric off-diagonal response
- $\frac{R_{xy}}{R_{xx}} \sim 20\%$ - because of the momentum matching
constraints in a Moire system. Our results help explain an important new
transport experiment on graphene-WSe$_2$ heterostructures, as well as are
relevant for other experimental systems with rotational symmetry broken down to
$C_2$, such as nematic systems and Kagome charge density waves.

coherent phonons on the thermal conductivity of CsPbBr3 phase change

Our study spans a wide temperature range covering the entire structural
spectrum. Notably, we demonstrate that the interactions between acoustic and
optical phonons result in contrasting trends of phonon frequency shifts for the
high-lying optical phonons in orthorhombic and cubic CsPbBr3 as temperature
varies. Our findings highlight the significance of wave-like tunneling of
coherent phonons in ultralow and glass-like thermal conductivity in halide

The Bloch electron energy spectrum of a crystalline solid is determined by
the underlying lattice structure at the atomic level. In a 2-dimensional (2d)
crystal it is possible to impose a superlattice with nanometer-scale
periodicity, allowing to tune the fundamental Bloch electron spectrum, and
enabling novel physical properties which are not accessible in the original
crystal. In recent years, a top-down approach for creating 2d superlattices on
monolayer graphene by means of nanopatterned electric gates has been studied,
which allows the formation of isolated energy bands and Hofstadter Butterfly
physics in quantizing magnetic fields. Within this approach, however, evidence
of electron correlations which drive many problems at the forefront of physics
research remains to be uncovered. In this work we demonstrate signatures of a
correlated insulator phase in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) modulated
by a gate-defined superlattice potential, manifested as a set of resistance
peaks centered at carrier densities of integer multiples of a single electron
per unit cell of the superlattice potential. We associate the correlated
insulator phase to the formation of flat energy bands due to the superlattice
potential combined with inversion symmetry breaking. Inducing correlated
electron phases with nanopatterning defined electric gates paves the way to
custom-designed superlattices with arbitrary geometries and symmetries for
studying band structure engineering and strongly correlated electrons in 2d
materials.

Four-dimensional state space geometry is worked out for the exactly solved
one-dimensional spin-3/2 lattice with a Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) Hamiltonian
as well as a more general one with a term containing a non-zero field coupling
to the octopole moments. The phase behaviour of the spin-3/2 chain is also
explored extensively and novel phenomena suggesting anomalies in the
hyperscaling relation and in the decay of fluctuations are reported for a range
of parameter values. Using the method of constrained fluctuations worked out
earlier in \cite{asknbads,riekan1} three sectional curvatures and a $3d$
curvature are obtained and shown to separately encode dipolar, quadrupolar and
octopolar correlations both near and away from pseudo-criticality. In all
instances of a seeming hyperscaling violation the $3d$ scalar curvature is
found to encode the correlation length while the relevant $2d$ curvature equals
the inverse of singular free energy. For parameter values where the order
parameter fluctuation anomalously decays despite a divergence in correlation
length the relevant scalar curvature undergoes a sign change to positive
values, signalling a possible change in statistics.

Finding the mean time it takes for a particle to escape from a meta-stable
state due to thermal fluctuations is a fundamental problem in physics,
chemistry and biology. For weak thermal noise, the mean escape time is captured
by the Arrhenius law (AL). Despite its ubiquity in nature and wide
applicability in practical engineering, the problem is typically limited to
single particle physics. Finding a generalized form of the AL for interacting
particles has eluded solution for a century. Here, we tackle this outstanding
problem and generalize the AL to a class of interacting diffusive systems
within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. The generalized AL
is shown to conform a non-trivial yet elegant form that depends crucially on
the particle density and inter-particle interactions. We demonstrate our
results for the paradigmatic exclusion and inclusion processes to underpin the
key effects of repulsive and attractive interactions. Intriguingly, we show how
to manipulate the mean escape time using not only temperature, but also the
particle density.

We theoretically propose a generation of an antiferro skyrmion crystal
(AF-SkX) in a synthetic bilayer antiferromagnetic system under an external
magnetic field. By performing the simulated annealing for a spin model on a
centrosymmetric bilayer triangular lattice, we find that the interplay among
the layer-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the easy-plane
single-ion anisotropy, the interlayer exchange interaction, and the in-plane
magnetic field leads to instability toward the AF-SkX. The obtained AF-SkX
consists of the skyrmion layer and anti-skyrmion layer with opposite skyrmion
numbers, which results in no skyrmion number as well as spin scalar chirality
in the whole system. We also show that a ferri-type skyrmion crystal, where one
of the layers has the skyrmion number of one and the other does not, appears
when the magnitude of the magnetic field is varied. Our results provide a
guideline to experimentally search for the AF-SkX in bulk and layered
materials.

Higher-order topological superconductors and superfluids have triggered a
great deal of interest in recent years. While Majorana corner or hinge states
have been studied intensively, whether superconductors and superfluids, being
topological or trivial, host higher-order topological Bogoliubov excitations
remains elusive. In this work, we propose that Bogoliubov corner excitations
can be driven from a trivial conventional $s$-wave superfluid through
mirror-symmetric local potentials. The topological Bogoliubov excited modes
originate from the nontrivial Bogoliubov excitation bands. These modes are
protected by mirror symmetry and robust against mirror-symmetric perturbations
as long as the Bogoliubov energy gap remains open. Our work provides new
insight into higher-order topological excitation states in superfluids and
superconductors.

A potential application of two-dimensional (2D) MXenes, such as Ti2CTx and
Ti3C2Tx, is energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors, batteries, and
hydride electrochemical cells, where intercalation of ions between the 2D
layers is considered as a charge carrier. Electrochemical cycling
investigations in combination with Ti 1s X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
have therefore been performed with the objective to study oxidation state
changes during potential variations. In some of these studies Ti3C2Tx has shown
main edge shifts in the Ti 1s X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES).
Here we show that these main edge shifts originate from the Ti 4p orbital
involvement in the bonding between the surface Ti and the termination species
at the fcc-sites. The study further shows that the t2g-eg crystal field
splitting (10Dq) observed in the pre-edge absorption region indicate weaker
Ti-C bonds in Ti2CTx and Ti3C2Tx compared to TiC and the corresponding MAX
phases. The results from this study provide information necessary for improved
electronic modeling and subsequently a better description of the materials
properties of the MXenes. In general, potential applications, where surface
interactions with intercalation elements are important processes, will benefit
from the new knowledge presented.

<h3>Disorder and quantum transport of helical quantum Hall phase in graphene</h3>

Recently, an exotic quantum Hall ferromagnet with spin-filtered helical edge
modes was observed in monolayer graphene on a high-dielectric constant
substrate at moderate magnetic fields, withstanding temperatures of up to 110
Kelvin [L. Veyrat et al., Science 367, 781 (2020)]. However, the characteristic
quantized longitudinal resistance mediated by these edge modes departs from
quantization with decreasing temperature. In this work, we investigate the
transport properties of helical edge modes in a graphene nanoribbon under a
perpendicular magnetic field using the Landauer-Buttiker transport formalism.
We find that the departure of quantization of longitudinal conductance is due
to the helical-edge gap opened by the Rashba spin-orbital coupling. The
quantization can be restored by weak nonmagnetic Anderson disorder at low
temperature, increasing the localization length, or by raising temperature at
weak disorder, through thermal broadening. The resulted conductance is very
close to the quantized value 2e2/h, which is in qualitatively consistent with
the experimental results. Furthermore, we suggest that the helical quantum Hall
phase in graphene could be a promising platform for creating Majorana zero
modes by introducing superconductivity.

Low-dimensional Ge hole devices are promising systems with many potential
applications such as hole spin qubits, Andreev spin qubits, Josephson
junctions, and can serve as a basis for the realization of topological
superconductivity. This vast array of potential uses for Ge largely stems from
the exceptionally strong and controllable spin-orbit interaction (SOI),
ultralong mean free paths, long coherence times, and CMOS compatibility.
However, when brought into proximity with a superconductor (SC), metallization
normally diminishes many useful properties of a semiconductor, for instance,
typically reducing the $g$ factor and SOI energy, as well as renormalizing the
effective mass. In this paper we consider metallization of a Ge nanowire (NW)
in proximity to a SC, explicitly taking into account the 3D geometry of the NW.
We find that proximitized Ge exhibits a unique phenomenology of metallization
effects, where the 3D cross section plays a crucial role. For instance, in
contrast to expectations, we find that SOI can be enhanced by strong coupling
to the superconductor. We also show that the thickness of the NW plays a
critical role in determining both the size of the proximity induced pairing
potential and metallization effects, since the coupling between NW and SC
strongly depends on the distance of the NW wave function from the interface
with the SC. In the absence of electrostatic effects, we find that a sizable
gap opens only in thin NWs ($d\lesssim 3$ nm). In thicker NWs, the wave
function must be pushed closer to the SC by electrostatic effects in order to
achieve a sizable proximity gap such that the required electrostatic field
strength can simultaneously induce a strong SOI. The unique and sometimes
beneficial nature of metallization effects in SC-Ge NW devices evinces them as
ideal platforms for future applications in quantum information processing.

Many thermal measurements in high magnetic fields require thermometers that
are sensitive over a wide temperature range, are low mass, have a rapid thermal
response, and have a minimal, easily correctable magnetoresistance. Here we
report the development of a new granular-metal oxide ceramic composite (cermet)
for this purpose formed by co-sputtering of the metallic alloy nichrome
Ni$_{0.8}$Cr$_{0.2}$ and the insulator silcon dioxide SiO$_2$. The resulting
thin films are sensitive enough to be used from room temperature down to below
100 mK in magnetic fields up to at least 35 tesla.

<br>
We present SCALINN -- Strongly Correlated Approach with Language Inspired
Neural Network -- as a method for solving the Anderson impurity model and
reducing the computational cost of dynamical mean-field theory calculations. In
analogy to generative Transformer networks and their use in natural language
processing, SCALINN utilises an in-house modified Transformer network to learn
information between low computational cost Green's function sequences, in order
to generate high accuracy Green's functions that were previously restricted
behind higher computational costs. Across different values of temperature and
interaction strengths, the performance of SCALINN is demonstrated in both
physical observables (spectral function, Matsubara Green's functions,
quasi-particle weight), and the mean squared error cost function values of the
neural network.

<h3>Magnetically tunable exciton valley coherence in monolayer WS$_2$  mediated by the electron-hole exchange and exciton-phonon interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06977</a>
<br>
<i>Kang Lan, Shijie Xie, Jiyong Fu, Fanyao Qu</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a model, which incorporates both intra- and intervalley
scatterings to master equation, to explore exciton valley coherence in
monolayer WS$_2$ subjected to magnetic field. For linearly polarized (LP)
excitation accompanied with an initial coherence, our determined valley
dynamics manifests the coherence decay being faster than the exciton population
relaxation, and agrees with experimental data by Hao et al.[Nat. Phys. 12, 677
(2016)]. Further, we reveal that magnetic field may quench the electron-hole
(e-h) exchange induced pure dephasing -- a crucial decoherence source -- as a
result of lifting of valley degeneracy, allowing to magnetically regulate
valley coherence. In particular, at low temperatures for which the
exciton-phonon (ex-ph) interaction is weak, we find that the coherence time is
expected to attain ${\tau}_{\mathcal{C}}\sim 1$ ps, facilitating full control
of qubits based on the valley pseudospin. For dark excitons, we demonstrate an
emerging coherence even in the absence of initial coherent state, which has a
long coherence time ($\sim 15$ ps) at low temperature. Our work provides an
insight into tunable valley coherence and coherent valley control based on dark
excitons.

<br>
<br>
The Kondo effect between localized $f$-electrons and conductive carriers
leads to exotic physical phenomena. Among them, heavy-fermion (HF) systems, in
which massive effective carriers appear due to the Kondo effect, have
fascinated many researchers. Dimensionality is also an important characteristic
of the HF system, especially because it is strongly related to quantum
criticality [S. Sachdev, Science 288, 475 (2000)]. However, perfect
two-dimensional (2D) HF materials have not been reported yet. Here, we report
the surface electronic structure of the monoatomic-layer Kondo lattice YbCu$_2$
on a Cu(111) surface observed by synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy. The 2D conducting band and the Yb 4$f$ state, located very close
to the Fermi level, are observed. These bands are hybridized at
low-temperature, forming the 2D HF state, with an evaluated coherent
temperature of about 30 K. The effective mass of the 2D state is enhanced by a
factor of 100 by the development of the HF state. Furthermore, clear evidence
of the hybridization gap formation in the temperature dependence of the
Kondo-resonance peak has been observed below the coherent temperature. Our
study provides a new candidate as an ideal 2D HF material for understanding the
Kondo effect at low dimensions.

<br>
<br>
Bloch oscillations are a fundamental phenomenon linking the adiabatic
transport of Cooper pairs to time. Here, we investigate synchronization of the
Bloch oscillations in a strongly coupled system of sub-100 nm Al/AlOx/Al
Josephson junctions in high-ohmic environment composed of highly inductive
meanders of granulated aluminum and high-ohmic titanium microstrips. We observe
a pronounced current mirror eff ect in the coupled junctions and demonstrate
current plateaus, akin to the fi rst dual Shapiro step in microwave
experiments. These fi ndings suggest that our circuit design holds promise for
realizing protected Bloch oscillations and precise Shapiro steps of interest
for current metrology.

<h3>Theoretical model for the extreme positive magnetoresistance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07020" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07020</a>
<br>
<i>George Kastrinakis</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a model for the positive extreme magnetoresistance (XMR), recently
observed in a plethora of metallic systems, such as PtSn$_4$, PtBi$_2$,
PdCoO$_2$, WTe$_2$, NbSb$_2$, NbP, TaSb$_2$, LaSb, LaBi, ZrSiS and MoTe$_2$.
The model is an extension of our earlier work on positive giant
magnetoresistance, and uses an elaborate diagrammatic formulation. XMR is a
bulk effect (not a surface effect), due to the dramatic sensitivity of the
conductivity to the finite magnetic field $H$. This is possible at low
temperatures, in the presence of finite disorder elastic spin scattering, and
for a special value, predicted from the theory, of the material-dependent
effective Coulomb repulsion. Good agreement with experiments is obtained.
According to our model XMR is higher in cleaner samples, and anisotropic with
regards to the direction of $H$. We discuss in particular compounds containing
the elements Pt, Sc, and Rh.

<h3>Dynamical mean-field approach to disordered interacting systems and  applications to quantum transport problem</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07029" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07029</a>
<br>
<i>Jiawei Yan, Philipp Werner</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss a non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field framework for simulating
inhomogeneous Hubbard models with local disorders. Our approach treats electron
interactions and disorders on equal footing, by considering only local
dynamical fluctuations. The theory reduces to non-equilibrium dynamical
mean-field theory in the presence of only electron-electron interactions and to
the coherent potential approximation in noninteracting systems with disorders.
Both time-dependent and steady-state problems are treated by implementing the
theory on the three branch Kadanoff-Baym contour and two-branch Keldysh
contour, respectively. Benchmarks on an $8$-site cube show that the method
yields rather accurate spectral functions in both the weakly and strongly
interacting regimes. In a cubic lattice, we demonstrate energy conservation
after an interaction quench and thermalization after just a few hopping times
in both clean and disordered systems. As an application, we study transport
through a serial double quantum-dot sandwiched between two leads, focusing on
the current and dot occupations after a voltage quench.

<br>
<br>
Although quantum simulation can give insight into elusive or intractable
physical phenomena, many quantum simulators are unavoidably limited in the
models they mimic. Such is also the case for atom arrays interacting via
Rydberg states - a platform potentially capable of simulating any kind of spin
exchange model, albeit with currently unattainable experimental capabilities.
Here, we propose a new route towards simulating generic spin exchange
Hamiltonians in atom arrays, using Floquet engineering with both global and
local control. To demonstrate the versatility and applicability of our
approach, we numerically investigate the generation of several spin exchange
models which have yet to be realized in atom arrays, using only
previously-demonstrated experimental capabilities. Our proposed scheme can be
readily explored in many existing setups, providing a path to investigate a
large class of exotic quantum spin models.

Light-emitting complex defects in silicon have been considered a potential
platform for quantum technologies based on spin and photon degrees of freedom
working at telecom wavelengths. Their integration in complex devices is still
in its infancy, and it was mostly focused on light extraction and guiding. Here
we address the control of the electronic states of carbon-related impurities
(G-centers) via strain engineering. By embedding them in patches of silicon on
insulator and topping them with SiN, symmetry breaking along [001] and [110]
directions is demonstrated, resulting in a controlled splitting of the zero
phonon line (ZPL), as accounted for by the piezospectroscopic theoretical
framework. The splitting can be as large as 18 meV and it is finely tuned by
selecting patch size or by moving in different positions on the patch. Some of
the split, strained ZPLs are almost fully polarized and their overall intensity
is enhanced up to 7 times with respect to the flat areas, whereas their
recombination dynamics is slightly affected. Our technique can be extended to
other impurities and Si-based devices such as suspended bridges, photonic
crystal microcavities, Mie resonators, and integrated photonic circuits.

<br>
<br>
We explore the dynamics and interactions of multiple bright droplets and
bubbles, as well as the interactions of kinks with droplets and with antikinks,
in the extended one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii model including the
Lee-Huang-Yang correction. Existence regions are identified for the droplets
and bubbles in terms of their chemical potential, verifying the stability of
the droplets and exposing the instability of the bubbles. The limiting case of
the droplet family is a stable kink. The interactions between droplets
demonstrate in-phase (out-of-phase) attraction (repulsion), with the so-called
Manton's method explicating the observed dynamical response, and mixed behavior
for intermediate values of the phase shift. Droplets bearing different chemical
potentials experience mass-exchange phenomena. Individual bubbles exhibit core
expansion and mutual attraction prior to their destabilization. Droplets
interacting with kinks are absorbed by them, a process accompanied by the
emission of dispersive shock waves and gray solitons. Kink-antikink
interactions are repulsive, generating counter-propagating shock waves. Our
findings reveal dynamical features of droplets and kinks that can be detected
in current experiments.

<h3>Morphology Transition with Temperature and their Effect on Optical  Properties of Colloidal MoS2 Nanostructures</h3>

<br>

Morphology plays a crucial role in deciding the chemical and optical
properties of nanomaterials due to confinement effects. We report the
morphology transition of colloidal molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanostructures,
synthesized by one pot heat-up method, from mix of quantum dots (QDs) and
nanosheets to predominantly nanorods by varying the synthesis reaction
temperature from 90 to 160 degree C. The stoichiometry and composition of the
synthesized QDs, nanosheets and nanorods have been quantified to be MoS2 using
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
analysis. Nanostructure morphology transition due to variation in reaction
temperature has resulted in photoluminescence quantum yield enhancement from
zero to 4.4% on increase in temperature from 90 to 120 degree C. On further
increase in temperature to 160 degree C, a decrease in quantum yield to 2.63%
is observed. A red shift of 18 nm and 140 nm in the emission maxima and
absorption edge respectively is observed for the synthesized nanostructures
with increase in reaction temperature from 90 to 160 degree C. The change in
the quantum yield is attributed to the change in shape and hence confinement of
charge carriers. To the best of our knowledge, first-time microscopic analysis
of colloidal MoS2 nanostructures shape and optical property variation with
temperature explained by non-classical growth mechanism is presented.

Superconductor/semiconductor hybrid devices have attracted increasing
interest in the past years. Superconducting electronics aims to complement
semiconductor technology, while hybrid architectures are at the forefront of
new ideas such as topological superconductivity and protected qubits. In this
work, we engineer the induced superconductivity in two-dimensional germanium
hole gas by varying the distance between the quantum well and the aluminum. We
demonstrate a hard superconducting gap and realize an electrically and flux
tunable superconducting diode using a superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID). This allows to tune the current phase relation (CPR), to a
regime where single Cooper pair tunneling is suppressed, creating a $ \sin
\left( 2 \varphi \right)$ CPR. Shapiro experiments complement this
interpretation and the microwave drive allows to create a diode with $ \approx
100 \%$ efficiency. The reported results open up the path towards monolithic
integration of spin qubit devices, microwave resonators and (protected)
superconducting qubits on a silicon technology compatible platform.

Oxygen vacancies in the perovskite insulator SrTiO$_3$ free electrons that
couple with other physical degrees of freedom such as lattice, orbital, and
spin. This leads to the emergence of exotic quantum states such as
superconductivity and unusual ferromagnetism. We perform density-functional
theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations and demonstrate that the
orientation and ordering of the TiO$_5$ pentahedra plays a crucial role.
Specifically, for vacancy-rich SrTiO$_{3-\delta}$ ($\delta\sim$0.5), we find a
chiral ordering of the TiO$_5$ pentahedra in a sixfold superlattice. This
chiral structure is accompanied by a chiral magnetic state with a net moment in
the (111) direction at room temperature, which can explain several experimental
observations.

<br>
<br>
We investigate non-equilibrium transport properties of a quantum dot in the
Coulomb blockade regime under the condition of negligible inelastic scattering
during the dwelling time of the electrons in the dot. Using the quantum kinetic
equation we show that the absence of thermalization leads to a double-step in
the distribution function of electrons on the dot, provided that it is
symmetrically coupled to the leads. This drastically changes nonlinear
transport through the dot resulting in an additional (compared to the
thermalized case) jump in the conductance at voltages close to the charging
energy, which could serve as an experimental manifestation of the absence of
thermalization.

Manipulating the interlayer twist angle is a powerful tool to tailor the
properties of layered two-dimensional crystals. The twist angle has a
determinant impact on these systems' atomistic structure and electronic
properties. This includes the corrugation of individual layers, formation of
stacking domains and other structural elements, and electronic structure
changes due to the atomic reconstruction and superlattice effects. However, how
these properties change with the twist angle (ta) is not yet well understood.
Here, we monitor the change of twisted bilayer MoS2 characteristics as function
of ta. We identify distinct structural regimes, with particular structural and
electronic properties. We employ a hierarchical approach ranging from a
reactive force field through the density-functional-based tight-binding
approach and density-functional theory. To obtain a comprehensive overview, we
analyzed a large number of twisted bilayers with twist angles in the range
0.2-59.6deg. Some systems include up to half a million atoms, making structure
optimization and electronic property calculation challenging. For 13<ta<47, the
structure is well-described by a moir\'e regime composed of two rigidly twisted
monolayers. At small ta (ta<3 and 57<ta), a domain-soliton regime evolves,
where the structure contains large triangular stacking domains, separated by a
network of strain solitons and short-ranged high-energy nodes. The corrugation
of the layers and the emerging superlattice of solitons and stacking domains
affects the electronic structure. Emerging predominant characteristic features
are Dirac cones at K and kagome bands. These features flatten for ta
approaching 0 and 60deg. Our results show at which ta range the characteristic
features of the reconstruction emerge and give rise to exciting electronics. We
expect our findings also to be relevant for other twisted bilayer systems.

<h3>Overlap Structure and Free Energy Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin  Glasses</h3>

We investigate scenarios in which the low-temperature phase of short-range
spin glasses comprises thermodynamic states which are nontrivial mixtures of
multiple incongruent pure state pairs. We construct a new kind of metastate
supported on Gibbs states whose edge overlap values with a reference state fall
within a specified range. Using this metastate we show that, in any dimension,
the variance of free energy difference fluctuations between pure states within
a single mixed Gibbs state with multiple edge overlap values diverges linearly
with the volume. This conclusion would be avoided if the distribution of edge
overlap values in any mixed Gibbs state has at most two values: the
self-overlap and an overlap between non-spin-flip related states at a smaller
value, as occurs in one-step replica symmetry breaking. We discuss some
implications of these results.

<h3>A simple all-inorganic hole-only device structure for monitoring the  trap densities in perovskite solar cells</h3>

<br>
<br>
One of the most critical challenges in soaring the performance of perovskite
solar cells is decreasing the density of trap states in the light-absorbing
perovskite layer. These traps cause an increase in the recombination of charge
carriers and decrease the efficiency of devices. One of the methods to study
the trap density is space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis. For this
purpose, some structures are needed with the ability to transport only
electrons or holes. The trap density can be calculated by investigating the
current-voltage diagram and finding the voltage corresponding to the slope
change point. One of the challenges in these structures is using organic
polymers like Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA as hole transport layers. They
have problems like high acidity, lack of stability against moisture, low charge
mobility, low conductivity, and high cost. In this work, a hole-only device
structure is explained, made based on inorganic materials, which possesses high
stability, a simple preparation method, and reasonable cost compared to
conventional hole-only device structures. This structure is built by coating a
nanostructured NiOx layer, perovskite, CIS, and Au on the ITO substrate. To
investigate the performance of this structure, various perovskite layers were
made at different experimental conditions, and their trap density was obtained
by the proposed hole-only device structure. The analysis of the photovoltaic
characteristics of cells revealed a clear correlation between the perovskite
layer's trap density and the cells' performance. Our results show the
introduced structure is a simple and stable structure that can be utilized in
studying the trap density in perovskite layers to make more efficient cells.

Hybrid or organic plastic crystals have the potential as lead-free
alternatives to conventional inorganic ferroelectrics. These materials are
gaining attention for their multiaxial ferroelectricity, above-room-temperature
Curie temperatures, and low-temperature synthesis. Here, we report a screening
study of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) resulting in 55 new candidate
plastic and plastic ionic ferroelectric molecular crystals, along with 16
previously reported ferroelectrics. With over 1.2 million entries in the CSD,
the screening procedure involved many steps, including considerations of
molecular geometry and size, space group, and hydrogen bonding pattern. The
spontaneous polarization and electronic band gaps were predicted using density
functional theory. 21 of the candidate ferroelectrics have a polarization
greater than 10 {\mu}C/cm2, out of which nine are reported at room temperature.

We report on the chemical structure and spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in
epitaxial {\alpha}-Fe2O3(hematite)(0001)/Pt(111) bilayers with hematite
thicknesses of 6 nm and 15 nm grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a MgO(111)
substrate. Unlike previous studies that involved Pt overlayers on hematite, the
present hematite films were grown on a stable Pt buffer layer and displayed
structural changes as a function of thickness. These structural differences
(the presence of a ferrimagnetic phase in the thinner film) significantly
affected the magnetotransport properties of the bilayers. We observed a sign
change of the SMR from positive to negative when the thickness of hematite
increased from 6 nm to 15 nm. For {\alpha}-Fe2O3(15 nm)/Pt, we demonstrated
room-temperature switching of the N\'eel order with rectangular, nondecaying
switching characteristics. Such structures open the way to extending
magnetotransport studies to more complex systems with double asymmetric
metal/hematite/Pt interfaces.

Active nematics undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking and show phase
separation instability. Within the prevailing notion that macroscopic
properties depend only on symmetries and conservation laws, different
microscopic models are used out of convenience. Here, we test this notion
carefully by analyzing three different microscopic models of apolar active
nematics. They share the same symmetry but differ in implementing reciprocal or
non-reciprocal interactions, including a Vicsek-like implementation. We show
how such subtle differences in microscopic realization determine if the
ordering transition is continuous or first order and whether the associated
phase separation is fluctuation-dominated or displays sharp interfaces.

We study two models of overdamped self-propelled disks in two dimensions,
with and without aligning interactions. Active mesoscale flows leading to
chaotic advection emerge in both models in the homogeneous dense fluid away
from dynamical arrest, forming streams and vortices reminiscent of multiscale
flow patterns in turbulence. We show that the characteristics of these flows do
not depend on the specific details of the active fluids, and result from the
competition between crowding effects and persistent propulsions. Our results
suggest that dense active fluids present a type of `active turbulence' distinct
from collective flows reported in other types of active systems.

Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ is a potential Kitaev magnet with a monoclinic layered
crystal structure. Recent investigations of the $C_3$-symmetric sister compound
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ have uncovered a unique triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic ground
state, as opposed to a single-$\mathbf{q}$ (zigzag) one, prompting us to
examine the influence of the reduced structural symmetry of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$
on its ground state. Neutron diffraction data obtained on a twin-free crystal
reveal that the ground state remains a multi-$\mathbf{q}$ state, despite the
system's strong in-plane anisotropy. This robustness of multi-$\mathbf{q}$
orders suggests that they are driven by a common mechanism in the honeycomb
cobaltates, such as higher-order magnetic interactions. Spin-polarized neutron
diffraction results show that the ordered moments are entirely in-plane, with
each staggered component orthogonal to the propagating wave vector. The
inferred ground state favors a so-called XXZ easy-plane anisotropic starting
point for the microscopic model over a Kitaev one, and features unequal ordered
moments reduced by strong quantum fluctuations.

Studies of glassy systems have shown how cyclic driving forms memories of
amplitude. We explore how choice of driving protocol reveals dramatically
different features of this memory. We model rearranging soft spots in sheared
amorphous solids as hysterons. Cyclic shear with positive and negative shear
strain reveals a return-point memory of multiple strains known from experiments
and molecular dynamics simulations, while asymmetric driving (e.g. only
positive shear strains) suppresses it. However, when we introduce frustrated
interactions between hysterons, we identify a different mechanism that restores
multiple memories for asymmetric driving and can be used for design. Our work
suggests that this enhanced memory is a leading-order signature of frustration.

In this paper, a statistical mechanical derivation of thermodynamically
consistent fluid dynamical equations is presented for viscous and
non-isothermal molecular fluids. The coarse-graining process is based on the
combination of the Dirac-delta formalism of Irving and Kirkwood and the
first-order Taylor expansion of the leading-order solution of the
Chapman-Enskog theory. The non-equilibrium thermodynamic quantities and
constitutive relations directly emerge in the proposed coarse-graining process,
which results in a completion of the phenomenological theory.

<h3>Geometric Localization of Waves on Thin Elastic Structures</h3>

We consider the localization of elastic waves in thin elastic structures with
spatially varying curvature profiles, using a curved rod and a singly-curved
shell as concrete examples. Previous work on related problems have largely
focused on the localization of flexural waves on such structures. Here, using
the semiclassical/WKB approximation, we show that in addition to flexural
waves, extensional and shear waves also form localized, bound states around
points where the absolute curvature of the structure has a minimum. These
findings open up novel ways to fine-tune the acoustic and vibrational
properties of thin elastic structures, and raise the possibility of introducing
new phenomena not easily captured by effective models of flexural waves alone.

A spin Hamiltonian, which characterizes interatomic interactions between spin
moments, is highly valuable in predicting and comprehending the magnetic
properties of materials. A deeper understanding of the microscopic origin of
magnetic interactions can open new pathways toward realizing nanometer-scale
systems for future spintronic devices. Here, we explore a method for explicitly
calculating interatomic exchange interactions in non-collinear configurations
of magnetic materials considering only a bilinear spin Hamiltonian in a local
scenario. Based on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of dimers
adsorbed on metallic surfaces, and with a focus on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) which is essential for stabilizing chiral non-collinear
magnetic states, we discuss the interpretation of the DMI when decomposed into
microscopic electron and spin densities and currents. We clarify the distinct
origins of spin currents induced in the system and their connection to the DMI.
In addition, we reveal how non-collinearity affects the usual DMI, which is
solely induced by spin-orbit coupling, and DMI-like interactions brought about
by non-collinearity. We explain how the dependence of the DMI on the magnetic
configuration establishes a connection between high-order magnetic
interactions, enabling the transition from a local to a global spin
Hamiltonian.

<h3>Direct Observation of the Translational Immobilization of Water  Molecules Under Nanoscale Confinement</h3>

Here, Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) analyzes the
translational dynamics of water confined inside reverse micelles (RMs). It
offers a unique insight into the translational diffusion of water inside RMs,
in particular measuring the diffusion in a "RM-fixed" frame, rather than
relative to the laboratory frame. This study seeks to confirm whether or not
the act of tuning the size of the RMs, which can be achieved simply by
adjusting the "water loading" ($w_0$, i.e., the mole ratio of surfactant to
water) offer a near-continuous tuning of the translational diffusion of water.
The results here confirm this supposition, while offering two additional
interesting observations (1) surprisingly, translational diffusion slows to a
near-stop for RMs that are small, but that still contain hundreds of water
molecules in their core and (2) even relatively large RMs exhibit translational
dynamics in their core (center) that is only as fast as translational dynamics
on the surface of a lipid bilayer; extrapolation to larger sized water pools
implies the need for tens of thousands of water molecules present in a confined
pool in order to recover bulk-like translational dynamics. The parts of this
study that take place at the lowest water loadings represent the first known
instance of an ODNP measurement where the probing spin label interacts
continuously with a full complement of water molecules (as opposed to sitting
buried inside a lipid membrane or protein core), and yet clearly observes only
slow translational diffusion of water. The particular system here, with an
NMR-silent CCl$_4$ dispersant, shoud prove easy to reproduce. Thus, this study
also opens up the pathway to future measurements where RMs serve as a ruler for
dynamics, in particular for smaller resonance frequencies that can ostensibly
detect the dynamics of the slower water inside severely confined (i.e., small)
RMs.

<h3>The unusual glassy dynamics of confluent epithelial monolayer is nearly  ideal for mode-coupling theory</h3>

Glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers are crucial for wound
healing, embryogenesis, cancer progression, etc. Despite many experimental and
simulation results, not much theoretical study exists due to the complex nature
of the systems leading to unusual properties such as subArrhenius relaxation.
On the other hand, the mode-coupling theory (MCT) of glass only requires the
static structure to give the dynamics. We have simulated the equilibrium Vertex
model of the epithelial monolayers, computed the radial distribution function
numerically, obtained the static structure factor via Fourier transform,
provided the data as input to MCT, calculated the dynamics numerically, and
compared that with the dynamics obtained from simulation. Except the spurious
non-ergodicity transition of MCT, we find remarkable agreement with the other
theoretical predictions in the sub-Arrhenius regime of the system. The
relaxation time increases as a power law, the exponent and the prefactor remain
constant, the auto-correlation function shows time-temperature superposition,
and the dynamics is sub-Arrhenius. In fact, confluent systems in this regime
are probably the first known ideal candidate without quenched disorder for MCT.
This discovery brings about two seemingly disparate fields together, provides
crucial insights into the dynamics of confluent systems, and promises a more
profound understanding of the theory.

<h3>Effective model and pairing tendency in bilayer Ni-based superconductor  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>

Since the discovery of cuprate, the origin of high-T$_c$ superconductivity
has been an outstanding puzzle. Recently, high-T$_c$ superconductivity was
observed in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, whose
structure hosts the apical oxygen between two layers, distinct from multi-layer
cuprates. Motivated by this discovery, we investigate its electronic structure
using first-principle calculations and superconductivity instabilities from
both weak-coupling and strong-coupling perspective. Based on the
first-principle band structures, we construct a bilayer two-orbital model on a
square lattice, which accurately captures the low-energy electronic properties.
Within this model, we study pairing instability using both functional
renormalization group approach and multi-orbital t-J model. An $s_{\pm}$-wave
pairing with sign-reversal gaps on different Fermi surfaces is revealed,
reminiscent of iron based superconductors. We also discuss the effect of
orthorhombic distortion and three-dimensional electronic structures and
possible experimental implications as well. Our study provides valuable
insights into unique nature of electronic structure and superconductivity in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and contributes to the understanding of unconventional
superconductors.
