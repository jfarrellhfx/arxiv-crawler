<h3>Collective Hall current in chiral active fluids: Coupling of phase and  mass transport through traveling bands</h3>

Active fluids composed of constituents that are constantly driven away from
thermal equilibrium can support spontaneous currents and can be engineered to
have unconventional transport properties. Here we report the emergence of
(meta-)stable traveling bands in computer simulations of aligning circle
swimmers. These bands are different from polar flocks and we show that they can
be understood as non-dispersive soliton solutions of the underlying non-linear
hydrodynamic equations with constant celerity (phase propagation speed) that is
much larger than the propulsion speed. In contrast to solitons in passive
media, these bands can induce a bulk particle current with a component
perpendicular to the propagation direction, thus constituting a collective Hall
(or Magnus) effect. Traveling bands require sufficiently small orbits and
undergo a discontinuous transition into a synchronized state with transient
polar clusters for large orbital radii.

<h3>Weak universality, quantum many-body scars and anomalous  infinite-temperature autocorrelations in a one-dimensional spin model with  duality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11161" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11161</a>
<br>

We study a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model with three-spin interactions and a
transverse magnetic field $h$. The model is known to have a $Z_2 \times Z_2$
symmetry, and a duality between $h$ and $1/h$. The self-dual point at $h=1$ is
a quantum critical point with a continuous phase transition. We compute the
critical exponents $z$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\nu$, and the central charge $c$
numerically using exact diagonalization. We find that both $z$ and $c$ are
equal to $1$, implying that the critical point is governed by a conformal field
theory with a marginal operator. The three-spin model exhibits Ashkin-Teller
criticality with an effective coupling that is intermediate between four-state
Potts model and two decoupled transverse field Ising models. An energy level
spacing analysis shows that the model is not integrable. For a system with an
even number of sites and periodic boundary conditions, there are exact
mid-spectrum zero-energy eigenstates whose number grows exponentially with the
system size. A subset of these eigenstates have wave functions which are
independent of the value of $h$ and have unusual entanglement structure; hence
these can be considered to be quantum many-body scars. The number of such
quantum scars scales at least linearly with system size. Finally, we study the
infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions at sites close to one end of an
open system. We find that some of the autocorrelators relax anomalously in
time, with pronounced oscillations and very small decay rates if $h \gg 1$ or
$h \ll 1$. If $h$ is close to the critical point, the autocorrelators decay
quickly to zero except for an autocorrelator at the end site.

<h3>Robustness and eventual slow decay of bound states of interacting  microwave photons in the Google Quantum AI experiment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11164" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11164</a>

<br>
<br>
Integrable models are characterized by the existence of stable excitations
that can propagate indefinitely without decaying. This includes multi-magnon
bound states in the celebrated XXZ spin chain model and its integrable Floquet
counterpart. A recent Google Quantum AI experiment [A. Morvan et al., Nature
612, 240 (2022)] realizing the Floquet model demonstrated the persistence of
such collective excitations even when the integrability is broken: this
observation is at odds with the expectation of ergodic dynamics in generic
non-integrable systems. We here study the spectrum of the model realized in the
experiment using exact diagonalization and physical arguments. We find that
isolated bands corresponding to the descendants of the exact bound states of
the integrable model are clearly observable in the spectrum for a large range
of system sizes. However, our numerical analysis of the localization properties
of the eigenstates suggests that the bound states become unstable in the
thermodynamic limit. A perturbative estimate of the decay rate agrees with the
prediction of an eventual instability for large system sizes.

<h3>Magnetic properties and structural phase transition in ultrathin fcc Fe  (111) and bcc Fe (111) films: first-principles study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11167" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11167</a>
<br>
<i>Jakub Meixner, Justyna Rychły-Gruszecka, Mirosław Werwiński</i>
<br>
<br>
The aim of this work is the investigation of the structural and magnetic
characteristics of Fe thin films with a triangular (hexagonal) lattice surfaces
(fcc (111) and bcc (111)). Properties of these structures have been calculated
using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in full-potential
local-orbital code (FPLO). The results indicate structural phase transition
from fcc to bcc structure at film thickness of about 21 Fe atomic monolayers.
Furthermore, findings show the positive magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) values
occur for below about 9 Fe monolayers indicating perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, and for larger number of Fe monolayers MAE switches to very small
negative values. Calculated spin magnetic moments initially decrease with film
thickness. However, at a thickness of structural phase transition (21 atomic
monolayers) we observe their sudden increase. The presented computational
results explain the experimentally observed structural transition and can help
select proper substrates with trigonal (hexagonal) lattice surfaces and
suitable lattice parameters for the deposition of ultrathin Fe (111) films.

<h3>Interaction-mitigated Landau damping</h3>

Bosonic collective modes are ubiquitous in metals, but over a wide range of
energy and momenta suffer from Landau damping, decaying into the continuum of
particle-hole excitations. Here we point out that interactions can suppress
this decay, protecting a finite fraction of the total spectral weight
associated with the collective mode, e.g. a plasmon. The underlying mechanism
is level repulsion between a discrete mode and the continuum. We demonstrate
the effect using a number of simplified models of strongly correlated
Fermi-liquid metals, including a ``solvable" random flavor model in the
large$-N$ limit. We discuss in detail the possibility of observing such an
avoided decay for plasmons in (moir\'e) graphene-like systems.

Resistive switching in thin films has been widely studied in a broad range of
materials. Yet the mechanisms behind electroresistive switching have been
persistently difficult to decipher and control, in part due to their
non-equilibrium nature. Here, we demonstrate new experimental approaches that
can probe resistive switching phenomena, utilizing amorphous TaO$_x$ as a model
material system. Specifically, we apply Scanning Microwave Impedance Microscopy
(sMIM) and cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy as direct probes of conductance
and electronic structure, respectively. These methods provide direct evidence
of the electronic state of TaO$_x$ despite its amorphous nature. For example CL
identifies characteristic impurity levels in TaO$_x$, in agreement with first
principles calculations. We applied these methods to investigate He-ion-beam
irradiation as a path to activate conductivity of materials and enable
electroforming-free control over resistive switching. However, we find that
even though He-ions begin to modify the nature of bonds even at the lowest
doses, the films conductive properties exhibit remarkable stability with large
displacement damage and they are driven to metallic states only at the limit of
structural decomposition. Finally, we show that electroforming in a nanoscale
junction can be carried out with a dissipated power of < 20 nW, a much smaller
value compared to earlier studies and one that minimizes irreversible
structural modifications of the films. The multimodal approach described here
provides a new framework toward the theory/experiment guided design and
optimization of electroresistive materials.

<h3>Filling-induced Mott transition and pseudogap physics in the triangular  lattice Hubbard model</h3>

It has been reported that upon doping a Mott insulator, there can be a
crossover to a strongly correlated metallic phase followed by a first-order
transition to another thermodynamically stable metallic phase. We call this
first-order metal-metal transition the Sordi transition. To show theoretically
that this transition is observable, it is important to provide calculations in
situations where magnetic phase transitions do not hide the Sordi transition.
It is also important to show that it can be found on large clusters and with
different approaches. Here, we use the dynamical cluster approximation to
reveal the Sordi transition on a triangular lattice at finite temperature in
situations where there is no long-range magnetic correlations. This is relevant
for experiments on candidate spin-liquid organics. We also show that the
metallic phase closest to the insulator is a distinct pseudogap phase that
occurs because of strong interactions and short-range correlations.

<h3>The challenges of measuring spin Seebeck noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11218</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Just as electronic shot noise results from the granularity of charge and the
statistical variation in the arrival times of carriers in driven conductors,
there are predictions for fundamental noise in magnon currents due to angular
momentum being carried by discrete excitations. The advent of the inverse spin
Hall effect as a transduction mechanism to convert spin current into charge
current raises the prospect of experimental investigations of such magnon shot
noise. Spin Seebeck effect measurements have demonstrated the electrical
detection of thermally driven magnon currents and have been suggested as an
avenue for accessing spin current fluctuations. We report measurements of spin
Seebeck structures made from yttrium iron garnet on gadolinium gallium garnet.
While these measurements do show an increase in measured noise in the presence
of a magnetic field at low temperatures, the dependence on field orientation
suggests an alternative origin for this signal. We describe theoretical
predictions for the expected magnitude of magnon shot noise, highlighting
ambiguities that exist. Analysis in terms of the sample geometry dependence of
the known inverse spin Hall transduction of spin currents into charge currents
implies that magnon shot noise detection through this approach is strongly
suppressed. Implications for future attempts to measure magnon shot noise are
discussed.

<h3>Sequential directional deposition of one-sided (In,Ga)N shells on GaN  nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy</h3>

<i>David van Treeck, Jonas Lähnemann, Guanhui Gao, Sergio Fernández Garrido, Oliver Brandt, Lutz Geelhaar</i>
<br>
<br>
Capitalizing on the directed nature of the atomic fluxes in molecular beam
epitaxy, we propose and demonstrate the sequential directional deposition of
lateral (In,Ga)N shells on GaN nanowires. In this approach, a sub-monolayer
thickness of each constituent atomic species, i.e. Ga, In, and N, is deposited
subsequently from the same direction by rotating the sample and operating the
shutters accordingly. Using multiple iterations of this process, we achieve the
growth of homogeneous shells on a single side facet of the nanowires. For
higher In content and thus lattice mismatch, we observe a strain-induced
bending of the nanowire heterostructures. The incorporation of In and the
resulting emission spectra are systematically investigated as a function of
both the growth temperature and the In/Ga flux ratio.

<h3>Vertical Ferroelectricity in Van der Waals Materials: Models and Devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11267" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11267</a>
<br>
<i>Yuwen Zhang, Chunfeng Cui, Chaoyu He, Tao Ouyang, Jin Li, Mingxing Chen, Chao Tang</i>
<br>
<br>
Ferroelectricity has a wide range of applications in functional electronics
and is extremely important for the development of next-generation information
storage technology, but it is difficult to achieve due to its special symmetry
requirements. In this letter, based on van derWaals stacking, a generic model
is proposed for realizing ferroelectric devices, where a freely movable center
layer is packaged in two fixed and symmetrically stacked layers. In this model,
the ferroelectric phase transition can be realized between the two equivalent
and eccentric ground stacking-states with opposite polarizations. By means of
first-principles calculations, taking the h-BN/h-BN/h-BN and h-BN/Graphene/h-BN
as feasible models, we carefully evaluate the magnitude of ferroelectricity.
The corresponding polarizations are estimated as 1.83 and 1.35 pC/m,
respectively, which are comparable to the sliding ferroelectricity. Such a new
tri-layer model of vertical ferroelectricity can be constructed by arbitrary
van derWaals semiconducting materials, and usually holds low switching barrier.
Optimized material combinations with remarkable polarization are highly
expectable to be discovered from the huge candidate set for future information
storage.

<h3>The loop-zag resonator: A loop-gap resonator design for improved  sensitivity in electron-spin resonance experiments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11269" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11269</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We present a novel design of loop-gap resonator, the loop-zag resonator, for
sub-X-band electron-spin resonance spectroscopy. The loop-zag design can
achieve improved coupling to small-sample spin systems through the improvement
of sample filling factor and RF $B_1$ field. By introducing ``zags'' to the
resonator's gap path, the capacitance is increased, accommodating a smaller
loop size and thereby a larger filling factor to maintain the requisite
resonant frequency. We present experimental spectra on five different
resonators, each with approximately the same resonant frequency of
$\sim2.9$~GHz, showing that an increase in the number of zags and reduction in
loop size gives rise to higher sensitivity. Finite-element simulations of these
resonators provide estimates of the improved filling factors obtained through
the addition of zags. The frequency range over which this loop-zag design is
practical enables a breadth of future applications in microwave engineering,
including ESR and ESR-like quantum information microwave techniques.

<h3>Optical and Acoustic Phonons in Turbostratic and Cubic Boron Nitride  Thin Films on Diamond Substrates</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report an investigation of the bulk optical, bulk acoustic, and surface
acoustic phonons in thin films of turbostratic boron nitride (t-BN) and cubic
boron nitride (c-BN) grown on B-doped polycrystalline and single-crystalline
diamond (001) and (111) substrates. The characteristics of different types of
phonons were determined using Raman and Brillouin-Mandelstam light scattering
spectroscopies. The atomic structure of the films was determined using
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and correlated with
the Raman and Brillouin-Mandelstam spectroscopy data. The HRTEM analysis
revealed that the cubic boron nitride thin films consisted of a mixture of c-BN
and t-BN phases, with c-BN being the dominant phase. It was found that while
visible Raman spectroscopy provided information for characterizing the t-BN
phase, it faced challenges in differentiating the c-BN phase either due to the
presence of high-density defects or the overlapping of the Raman features with
those from the B-doped diamond substrates. In contrast, Brillouin-Mandelstam
spectroscopy clearly distinguishes the bulk longitudinal and surface acoustic
phonons of the c-BN thin films grown on diamond substrates. Additionally, the
angle-dependent surface Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering data show the peaks
associated with the Rayleigh surface acoustic waves, which have higher phase
velocities in c-BN films on diamond (111) substrates. These findings provide
valuable insights into the phonon characteristics of the c-BN and diamond
interfaces and have important implications for the thermal management of
electronic devices based on ultra-wide-band-gap materials.

<br>
Controlling the formation and stoichiometric content of desired phases of
materials has become a central interest for the study of a variety of fields,
notably high temperature superconductivity under extreme pressures. The further
possibility of accessing metastable states by initiating reactions by x-ray
triggered mechanisms over ultra-short timescales is enabled with the
development of x-ray free electron lasers (XFEL). Utilizing the exceptionally
high brilliance x-ray pulses from the EuXFEL, we report the synthesis of a
previously unobserved yttrium hydride under high pressure, along with
non-stoichiometric changes in hydrogen content as probed at a repetition rate
of 4.5\,MHz using time-resolved x-ray diffraction. Exploiting non-equilibrium
pathways we synthesize and characterize a hydride with yttrium cations in an
\textit{A}15 structure type at 125\,GPa, predicted using crystal structure
searches, with a hydrogen content between 4.0--5.75 hydrogens per cation, that
is enthalpically metastable on the convex hull. We demonstrate a tailored
approach to changing hydrogen content using changes in x-ray fluence that is
not accessible using conventional synthesis methods, and reveals a new paradigm
in metastable chemical physics.

<h3>Structural analysis of zirconium oxynitride/water interface using neural  network potential</h3>

<br>
<br>
Zr oxides with oxygen-nitrogen substitutions and oxygen vacancies are
promising candidates to replace Pt as electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction
reaction. To understand the microscopic structure of the catalyst/water
interface, many nanosecond-long molecular dynamics simulations were performed
using the interatomic force field constructed by machine learning the ab initio
calculations. A defective Zr$_7$O$_8$N$_4$/H$_2$O interface model was simulated
and compared with a pristine ZrO$_2$/H$_2$O interface model. Water was found to
be adsorbed on the surface partly as a H$_2$O molecule or as dissociated
components, OH and H, on both surfaces. On the pristine ZrO$_2$ surface, H$_2$O
molecules show a monolayer adsorption structure and adsorb on all Zr atoms with
equal probability. On defective Zr$_7$O$_8$N$_4$ surface, however, H$_2$O
molecules show a bilayer adsorption structure and do not adsorb on the oxygen
vacancies but only on some of the surrounding Zr atoms. The total number of the
molecular and dissociative adsorptions are almost the same on both surfaces,
but a larger number are dissociatively adsorbed on the pristine surface.
Possible implications for the catalytic behaviour are discussed.

<h3>First-principles prediction of phase transition of YCo$_5$ from  self-consistent phonon calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11304</a>
<br>
<i>Guangzong Xing, Yoshio Miura, Terumasa Tadano</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent theoretical study has shown that the hexagonal YCo$_5$ is dynamically
unstable and distorts into a stable orthorhombic structure. In this study, we
show theoretically that the orthorhombic phase is energetically more stable
than the hexagonal phase in the low-temperature region, while the phonon
entropy stabilizes the hexagonal phase thermodynamically in the
high-temperature region. The orthorhombic-to-hexagonal phase transition
temperature is $\sim$165 K, which is determined using the self-consistent
phonon calculations. We investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy
(MAE) using the self-consistent and non-self-consistent (force theorem)
calculations with the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) along with the Hubbard $U$
correction. Then, we find that the orthorhombic phase has similar MAE, orbital
moment, and its anisotropy to the hexagonal phase when the self-consistent
calculation with the SOI is performed. Since the orthorhombic phase still gives
magnetic properties comparable to the experiments, the orthorhombic distortion
is potentially realized in the low-temperature region, which awaits
experimental exploration.

<h3>Stochastic pole expansion method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11324</a>
<br>
<i>Li Huang, Shuang Liang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we propose a new analytic continuation method to extract real
frequency spectral functions from imaginary frequency Green's functions of
quantum many-body systems. This method is based on the pole representation of
Matsubara Green's function and a stochastic sampling procedure is utilized to
optimize the amplitudes and locations of poles. In order to capture narrow
peaks and sharp band edges in the spectral functions, a constrained sampling
algorithm and a self-adaptive sampling algorithm are developed. To demonstrate
the usefulness and performance of the new method, we at first apply it to study
the spectral functions of representative fermionic and bosonic correlators.
Then we employ this method to tackle the analytic continuation problems of
matrix-valued Green's functions. The synthetic Green's functions, as well as
realistic correlation functions from finite temperature quantum many-body
calculations, are used as input. The benchmark results demonstrate that this
method is capable of reproducing most of the key characteristics in the
spectral functions. The sharp, smooth, and multi-peak features in both
low-frequency and high-frequency regions of spectral functions could be
accurately resolved, which overcomes one of the main limitations of the
traditional maximum entropy method. More importantly, it exhibits excellent
robustness with respect to noisy and incomplete input data. The causality of
spectral function is always satisfied even in the presence of sizable noises.
As a byproduct, this method could derive a fitting formula for the Matsubara
data, which provides a compact approximation to the many-body Green's
functions. Hence, we expect that this new method could become a pivotal
workhorse for numerically analytic continuation and be broadly useful in many
applications.

<h3>Anisotropic Interlayer Force Field for Group-VI Transition Metal  Dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<br>
An anisotropic interlayer force field that describes the interlayer
interactions in homogeneous and heterogeneous interfaces of group-VI transition
metal dichalcogenides (MX2 where M = Mo, W and X = S, Se) is presented. The
force field is benchmarked against density functional theory calculations for
bilayer systems within the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid density functional
approximation, augmented by a nonlocal many-body dispersion treatment of
long-range correlation. The parametrization yields good agreement with
reference calculations of binding energy curves and sliding potential energy
surfaces. It is found to be transferable to TMD junctions outside the training
set that contain the same atom types. Calculated bulk moduli agree with most
previous dispersion corrected DFT predictions, which underestimate available
experimental values. Calculated phonon spectra of the various junctions under
consideration demonstrate the importance of appropriately treating the
anisotropic nature of layered interfaces. Considering our previous
parameterization for MoS2, the interlayer potential enables accurate and
efficient large-scale simulations of the dynamical, tribological, and thermal
transport properties of a large set of homogeneous and heterogeneous TMD
interfaces.

<i>Xilin Feng, Qiang Zhang, Zhongyi Zhang, Yuhao Gu, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu</i>
<br>
<br>
We classify the pairing symmetries of three-dimensional superconductivity in
the zinc-blende structure which can support an electronic environment to host
unconventional high temperature superconductivity, and calculate the pairing
symmetry in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation by the slave
boson mean-field approach. We find that the $d_{2z^2-x^2-y^2} \pm id_{x^2-y^2}$
pairing state, a three dimensional analogy of the $d\pm id$ pairing in a two
dimensional square lattice, is ubiquitously favored near half filling upon hole
doping in both single-orbital and three-orbital models. However, unlike the two
dimensional counterpart, the Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum of the three
dimensional state upholds the full $T_d$ point group symmetry and encompasses
point nodes along certain high symmetric lines.

<h3>Effect of Doping on the phase stability and Superconductivity in LaH10</h3>

<i>Zepeng Wu, Yang Sun, Feng Zheng, Vladimir Antropov, Kai-Ming Ho, Shunqing Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a computational investigation into the effects of chemical doping
with 15 different elements on phase stability and superconductivity in the
LaH10 structure. Most doping elements were found to induce softening of phonon
modes, enhancing electron-phonon coupling and improving critical
superconducting temperature while weakening dynamical stability. Unlike these
dopants, Ce was found to extend the range of dynamical stability for LaH10 by
eliminating the van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. The doped compound,
La0.75Ce0.25H10, maintains high-temperature superconductivity. We also
demonstrate that different Ce doping configurations in the LaH10 structure have
a minimal effect on energetic stability and electron-phonon coupling strength.
Our findings suggest that Ce is a promising dopant to stabilize LaH10 at lower
pressures while preserving its high-temperature superconductivity.

<h3>Gigantic Anisotropy of Self-Induced Spin-Orbit Torque in Weyl  Ferromagnet Co2MnGa</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin-orbit torque (SOT) is receiving tremendous attention from both
fundamental and application-oriented aspects. Co2MnGa, a Weyl ferromagnet that
is in a class of topological quantum materials, possesses cubic-based high
structural symmetry, the L21 crystal ordering, which should be incapable of
hosting anisotropic SOT in conventional understanding. Here we show the
discovery of a gigantic anisotropy of self-induced SOT in Co2MnGa. The
magnitude of the SOT is comparable to that of heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayer
systems despite the high inversion symmetry of the Co2MnGa structure. More
surprisingly, a sign inversion of the self-induced SOT is observed for
different crystal axes. This finding stems from the interplay of the
topological nature of the electronic states and their strong modulation by
external strain. Our research enriches the understanding of the physics of
self-induced SOT and demonstrates a versatile method for tuning SOT
efficiencies in a wide range of materials for topological and spintronic
devices.

Based on a tight-binding model for the electron system, we investigate the
transfer of energy, momentum, and angular momentum mediated by electromagnetic
fields among buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) and graphene nano-strips. Our
nonequilibrium Green's function approach enables calculations away from local
thermal equilibrium where the fluctuation-dissipation theorem breaks down. For
example, the forces between C$_{60}$ and current-carrying nano-strips are
predicted. It is found that the presence of current usually enhances the van
der Waals attractive forces. For two current-carrying graphene strips rotated
at some angle, the fluctuational force and torque are much stronger at the
nanoscale compared to that of the static Biot-Savart law.

$1T$-TiSe$_2$ is believed to posses a soft electronic mode, i.e., plasmon or
exciton, that might be responsible for the exciton condensation and
charge-density-wave (CDW) transition. Here, we explore collective electronic
excitations in single-layer $1T$-TiSe$_2$ by using the ab-initio
electromagnetic linear response and unveil intricate scattering pathways of
two-dimensional (2D) plasmon mode. We found the dominant role of plasmon-phonon
scattering, which in combination with the CDW gap excitations leads to the
anomalous temperature dependence of the plasmon linewidth across the CDW
transition. Below the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$ a strong
hybridization between 2D plasmon and CDW excitations is obtained. These optical
features are highly tunable due to temperature-dependent CDW gap modifications
and are argued to be universal for the CDW-bearing 2D materials.

When semi-infinite phononic crystals (PCs) are in contact, localized modes
may exist at their boundary. The central question is generally to predict their
existence and to determine their stability. With the rapid expansion of the
field of topological insulators, powerful tools have been developed to address
these questions. In particular, when applied to one-dimensional systems with
mirror symmetry, the bulk-boundary correspondence claims that the existence of
interface modes is given by a topological invariant computed from the bulk
properties of the phononic crystal, which ensures strong stability properties.
This one-dimensional bulk-boundary correspondence has been proven in various
works. Recent attempts have exploited the notion of surface impedance, relying
on analytical calculations of the transfer matrix. In the present work, the
monotonic evolution of surface impedance with frequency is proven for all
one-dimensional phononic crystals with mirror symmetry. This result allows us
to establish a stronger version of the bulk-boundary correspondence that
guarantees not only the existence but also the uniqueness of a topologically
protected interface state. The method is numerically illustrated in the
physically relevant case of PCs with imperfect interfaces, where analytical
calculations would be out of reach.

<h3>Engineering mobility in quasiperiodic lattices with exact mobility edges</h3>

We investigate the effect of an additional modulation parameter $\delta$ on
the mobility properties of quasiperiodic lattices described by a generalized
Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma model with two on site modulation parameters. For the
case with bounded quasiperiodic potential, we unveil the existence of
self-duality relation, independent of $\delta$. By applying Avila's global
theory, we analytically derive Lyapunov exponents in the whole parameter space,
which enables us to determine mobility edges or anomalous mobility edges
exactly. Our analytical results indicate that the mobility edge equation is
described by two curves and their intersection with the spectrum gives the true
mobility edge. Tuning the strength parameter $\delta$ can change the spectrum
of the quasiperiodic lattice, and thus engineers the mobility of quasi-periodic
systems, giving rise to completely extended, partially localized, and
completely localized regions. For the case with unbounded quasiperiodic
potential, we also obtain the analytical expression of the anomalous mobility
edge, which separates localized states from critical states. By increasing the
strength parameter $\delta$, we find that the critical states can be destroyed
gradually and finally vanishes.

<h3>Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy of single crystalline KH$_{2}$PO$_{4}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
This study employs resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) to investigate the
elastic properties of single crystalline KH$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ (KDP) through the
paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition. Noteworthy anomalies are
observed in selected resonance modes and their corresponding mechanical quality
factors ($Q$) around the transition temperature. The thermal evolution of
elastic constants ($C_{ij}$) across the phase transition reveals a significant
softening of $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{13}$, accompanied by a stiffening in
$C_{66}$. Additionally, both $C_{33}$ and $C_{44}$ exhibit a minimum value at
the transition. This anomalous behavior of all elastic constants ($C_{ij}$)
across the phase transition suggests the involvement of higher-order coupling
between the lattice and polarization in the KDP crystal. Furthermore, the bulk
modulus ($B$) undergoes a sudden softening precisely at the transition, while
the shear modulus ($G$) initially softens and subsequently stiffens across the
transition.

<h3>Unveiling the solid-like dynamics of liquids at low-frequency via  nano-confinement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11429</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
At frequencies higher than the inverse of the structural relaxation time
$\tau$, the dynamics of liquids display several solid-like properties,
including propagating collective shear waves and emergent elasticity. However,
in classical bulk liquids, where $\tau$ is typically of the order of 1 ps or
less, this solid-like behavior cannot be observed in the low-frequency region
of the vibrational density of states (VDOS), below a few meV. In this work, we
provide compelling evidence for the emergent solid-like nature of liquids at
short distances through inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the
low-frequency vibrational density of states (VDOS) in liquid water and glycerol
confined within graphene oxide membranes. In particular, upon increasing the
strength of confinement, we observe a continuous evolution from a liquid-like
VDOS (linear in the frequency $\omega$) to a solid-like behavior (Debye law,
$\sim\omega^2$) in the range of $1$-$4$ meV. Molecular dynamics simulations
confirm these findings and reveal additional solid-like features, including
propagating collective shear waves and a reduction in the self-diffusion
constant. Finally, we show that the onset of solid-like dynamics is pushed
towards low frequency because of the slowing-down of the relaxation processes
upon confinement, and that the scale at which solidity emerges is qualitatively
compatible with k-gap theory and the concept of gapped momentum states. Our
results provide a convincing experimental proof of the continuity between
liquids and solids, as originally advocated by Frenkel and Maxwell, and a
deeper understanding of the dynamics of liquids across a wide range of length
scales.

<h3>Generalized Maximum Entropy Methods as Limits of the Average Spectrum  Method</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that in the continuum limit, the average spectrum method (ASM) is
equivalent to maximizing R\'enyi entropies of order $\eta$, of which Shannon
entropy is the special case $\eta=1$. The order of R\'enyi entropy is
determined by the way the spectra are sampled. Our derivation also suggests a
modification of R\'enyi entropy, giving it a non-trivial $\eta\to0$ limit. We
show that the sharper peaks generally obtained in ASM are associated with
entropies of order $\eta<1$. Our work provides a generalization of the maximum
entropy method that enables extracting more structure than the traditional
method.

<br>
<br>
Structural phase transition can occur due to complex mechanisms other than
simple dynamical instability, especially when the parent and daughter structure
is of low dimension. This article reports such an inversion symmetry-breaking
structural phase transition in a quasi-1D compound (TaSe$_4$)$_3$I at T$_S\sim$
141~K studied by Raman spectroscopy. Our investigation of collective lattice
dynamics reveals three additional Raman active modes in the low-temperature
non-centrosymmetric structure. Two vibrational modes become Raman active due to
the absence of an inversion center, while the third mode is a soft phonon mode
resulting from the vibration of Ta atoms along the \{-Ta-Ta-\} chains.
Furthermore, the most intense Raman mode display Fano-shaped asymmetry,
inferred as the signature of strong electron-phonon coupling. The group theory
and symmetry analysis of Raman spectra confirm the displacive-first-order
nature of the structural transition. Therefore, our results establish
(TaSe$_4)_3$I as a model system with broken inversion symmetry and strong
electron-phonon coupling in the quasi-1D regime.

During the last 15 years bottom-up on-surface synthesis has been demonstrated
as an efficient way to synthesize carbon nanostructures with atomic precision,
opening the door to unprecedented electronic control at the nanoscale.
Nanoporous graphenes (NPGs) fabricated as two-dimensional arrays of graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs) represent one of the key recent breakthroughs in the field.
NPGs interestingly display in-plane transport anisotropy of charge carriers,
and such anisotropy was shown to be tunable by modulating quantum interference.
Herein, using large-scale quantum transport simulations, we show that
electrical anisotropy in NPGs is not only resilient to disorder but can further
be massively enhanced by its presence. This outcome paves the way to systematic
engineering of quantum transport in NPGs as a novel concept for efficient
quantum devices and architectures.

We demonstrate numerically that a pure time-harmonic bias AC current of some
particular amplitude $\tau_f$ and angular frequency $\omega_f$ can excite the
chaotic magnetization dynamics in a Josephson-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin
Hall oscillator (SHO) having a biaxial magnetic anisotropy of an AFM layer. The
nature of such a stochastic generation regime in a Josephson-like AFM SHO could
be explained by the random hopping of the SHO's work point between several
quasi-stable states under the action of applied AC current. We revealed that
depending on the $\omega_f/\tau_f$ ratio several stochastic generation regimes
interspersed with regular generation regimes can be achieved in an AFM SHO that
can be used in spintronic sources of random signals and various nano-scale
devices utilizing random signals including the spintronic p-bit device
considered in this paper. The obtained results are important for the
development and optimization of spintronic devices able to generate and process
(sub-)THz-frequency random signals promising for ultra-fast probabilistic
computing, cryptography, secure communications, etc.

As a topological Dirac semimetal with controllable spin-orbit coupling and
conductivity, PtSe$_2$, a transition-metal dichalcogenide, is a promising
material for several applications from optoelectric to sensors. However, its
potential for spintronics applications is yet to be explored. In this work, we
demonstrate that PtSe$_{2}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ heterostructure can generate a
large damping-like current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOT), despite the
absence of spin-splitting in bulk PtSe$_{2}$. The efficiency of charge-to-spin
conversion is found to be $(-0.1 \pm 0.02)$~nm$^{-1}$ in
PtSe$_{2}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, which is three times that of the control sample,
Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Pt. Our band structure calculations show that the SOT due to
the PtSe$_2$ arises from an unexpectedly large spin splitting in the
interfacial region of PtSe$_2$ introduced by the proximity magnetic field of
the Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ layer. Our results open up the possibilities of using
large-area PtSe$_{2}$ for energy-efficient nanoscale devices by utilizing the
proximity-induced SOT.

$\beta^*$, relaxations of the glassy polymer polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), by
Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC), Thermally Stimulated

show how the $\alpha$ and $\beta^*$ relaxations can be considered part of a
very broad and distributed relaxation. The $\beta^*$ relaxation is composed of
a main contribution ($\beta_3^*$) and two additional ones ($\beta_1^*$ and
$\beta_2^*$) and each elementary mode of the relaxation has its own glass
transition temperature. This scenario gives rise to an extended glass
transition mainly centered in $T_{g\beta^*} \sim 305$ K and $T_{g\alpha} \sim
387$ K.

Close to equilibrium, the excess heat governs the static fluctuations. We
study the heat capacity in that McLennan regime, i.e., in linear order around
equilibrium, using an expression in terms of the average energy that extends
the equilibrium formula in the canonical ensemble. It is derivable from an
entropy and it always vanishes at zero temperature. The violation of an
extended Third Law is therefore a nonlinear effect.

Recent studies identified spin-order-driven phenomena such as spin-charge
interconversion without relying on the relativistic spin-orbit interaction.
Those physical properties can be prominent in systems containing light magnetic
atoms due to sizable exchange splitting and may pave the way for realizations
of giant responses correlated with the spin degree of freedom. In this paper,
we present a systematic symmetry analysis based on the spin crystallographic
groups and identify physical property of a vast number of magnetic materials up
to 1500 in total. Absence of spin-orbital entanglement leads to the spin
crystallographic symmetry having richer property compared to the well-known
magnetic space group symmetry. By decoupling the spin and orbital degrees of
freedom, our analysis enables us to take a closer look into the relation
between the dimensionality of spin structures and the resultant physical
properties and to identify the spin and orbital contributions separately. In
stark contrast to the established analysis with magnetic space groups, the spin
crystallographic group manifests richer symmetry including spin translation
symmetry and leads to nontrivial emergent responses. For representative
examples, we discuss geometrical nature of the anomalous Hall effect and
magnetoelectric effect, and classify the spin Hall effect arising from the
spontaneous spin-charge coupling. Using the power of computational analysis, we
apply our symmetry analysis to a wide range of magnets, encompassing complex
magnets such as those with noncoplanar spin structures as well as collinear and
coplanar magnets. We identify emergent multipoles relevant to physical
responses and argue that our method provides a systematic tool for exploring
sizable electromagnetic responses driven by spin ordering.

Degenerate states in condensed matter are frequently the cause of unwanted
fluctuations, which prevent the formation of ordered phases and reduce their
functionalities. Removing these degeneracies has been a common theme in
materials design, pursued for example by strain engineering at interfaces.
Here, we explore a non-equilibrium approach to lift degeneracies in solids. We
show that coherent driving of the crystal lattice in bi- and multilayer
graphene, boosts the coupling between two doubly-degenerate modes of E1u and
E2g symmetry, which are virtually uncoupled at equilibrium. New vibronic states
result from anharmonic driving of the E1u mode to large amplitdues, boosting
its coupling to the E2g mode. The vibrational structure of the driven state is
probed with time-resolved Raman scattering, which reveals laser-field dependent
mode splitting and enhanced lifetimes. We expect this phenomenon to be
generally observable in many materials systems, affecting the non-equilibrium
emergent phases in matter.

harmonic potentials. Subsequently, we analyzed the squared norm of the wave
function and the uncertainty of the position as functions of the deformation
parameter $\alpha$. Our findings reveal that the EUP significantly impacts the
amplitude and uncertainty position of the bright and dark soliton solutions.

combined use of XMCD and XMLD at the Mn-absorption edge allows us to assess the

allows us to rapidly photo-polymerize compliant elastic inclusions in the
continuously remodelling active system. Moreover, we quantitatively settle
long-standing theoretical predictions, such as a postulated relationship
encoding the intrinsic time scale of the active nematic in terms of {\eta} and
{\alpha}. In parallel, we infer a value for the nematic elasticity constant, K,
by combining our measurements with the theorized scaling of the active length
scale. On top of the microrheology capatilities, we demonstrate novel
strategies for defect encapsulation, quantification of defect mechanics, and
defect interactions, enabled by the versatility of the new microfabrication
strategy that allows to combine elastic motifs of different shape and stiffness

Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are

randomness and uncertainty, they are however difficult to characterize. Here,
we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal
set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic
process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder
architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic
diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal
relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the
method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the
expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables for the autonomous
discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence
enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.

Transverse plasma polaritons and longitudinal plasmons describe the
propagation of light-matter modes in an isotropic metal. However, in a layered
metal the anisotropy of the bare electromagnetic response mixes the
longitudinal and transverse excitations, making the distinction between
polariton and plasmon blurred at small wavevectors, where retardation effects
of the electromagnetic interactions become quantitatively relevant. In the
usual Kubo approach for the linear response, this effect appears as a mixing
between the density and the transverse current fluctuations, that requires to
revise the standard RPA approach for density correlations where only the
instantaneous Coulomb potential is included. In this paper we derive the
general expression for the density and current correlation functions at long
wavelength in a layered metal, showing that below a crossover scale set by the
anisotropy of the plasma frequencies retardation effects make the dispersion of
the generalized plasma modes different from the standard RPA result. In
addition, the mixed longitudinal and transverse nature of these excitations
reflects in a double-peak structure for the density response, that can be
eventually accessed by means of high-momentum resolution electron-energy-loss
or X-rays spectroscopies.

Sagnac interferometry can provide a significant improvement in
signal-to-noise ratio compared to conventional magnetic imaging based on the
magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). We show that this improvement is sufficient
to allow quantitative measurements of current-induced magnetic deflections due
to spin-orbit torque even in thin-film magnetic samples with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy for which the Kerr rotation is second-order in the magnetic
deflection. Sagnac interfermometry can also be applied beneficially for samples
with in-plane anisotropy, for which the Kerr rotation is first order in the
deflection angle. Optical measurements based on Sagnac interferometry can
therefore provide a cross-check on electrical techniques for measuring
spin-orbit torque. Different electrical techniques commonly give quantitatively
inconsistent results, so that Sagnac interferometry can help to identify which
techniques are affected by unidentified artifacts.

The lack of the theory of the crystalline electric field (CEF) in rare-earth
based quasicrystal (QC) and approximant crystal (AC) has prevented us from
understanding the electronic states. Recent success of the formulation of the
CEF theory on the basis of the point charge model has made it possible to
analyze the CEF microscopically. Here, by applying this formulation to the QC
Au-SM-Dy (SM=Si, Ge, Al, and Ga) and AC, we theoretically analyze the CEF. In
the Dy$^{3+}$ ion with $4f^9$ configuration, the CEF Hamiltonian is
diagonalized by the basis set for the total angular momentum $J=15/2$. The
ratio of the valences of the screened ligand ions $\alpha=Z_{\rm SM}/Z_{\rm
Au}$ plays an important role in characterizing the CEF ground state. For
$0\le\alpha<0.30$, the magnetic easy axis for the CEF ground state is shown to
be perpendicular to the mirror plane. On the other hand, for $\alpha>0.30$, the
magnetic easy axis is shown to be lying in the mirror plane and as $\alpha$
increases, the easy axis rotates to the clockwise direction in the mirror plane
at the Dy site and tends to approach the pseudo 5 fold axis. Possible relevance
of these results to experiments is discussed.

Two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells close to the topological
phase transition can generate significant cyclotron emission that is magnetic
field tunable in the Terahertz (THz) frequency range. Due to their
relativistic-like dynamics, their cyclotron mass is strongly dependent on their
electron concentration in the quantum well, providing a second tunability lever
and paving the way for a gate-tunable, permanent-magnet Landau laser. In this
work, we demonstrate the proof-of-concept of such a back-gate tunable THz
cyclotron emitter at fixed magnetic field. The emission frequency detected at
1.5 Tesla is centered on 2.2 THz and can already be electrically tuned over 250
GHz. With an optimized gate and a realistic permanent magnet of 1.0 Tesla, we
estimate that the cyclotron emission could be continuously and rapidly tunable
by the gate bias between 1 and 3 THz, that is to say on the less covered part
of the THz gap.

We consider planar Josephson junctions, with dimensions as used in recent
experiments, and show using numerical calculations that the junctions undergo
topological superconducting transition, revealed by the appearance of
zero-energy Majorana bound states at the ends of the non-superconducting
channel of the junctions in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and
$\pi$ phase difference between the superconducting leads. Our main finding is
that, under realistic parameter settings, the critical supercurrent undergoes a
minimum and the ground state phase increases from zero toward $\pi$ at a
critical field, without the junctions necessarily transitioning into a
topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, the critical supercurrent
minimum and a simultaneous sharp jump in the ground state phase appear in
junctions that are undoubtedly in trivial superconducting phase. Our results
provide updated insights for experimental detection of topological
superconductivity in planar Josephson junctions using the supercurrent and
phase signatures.

A simple impurity solver is shown to capture the impurity-induced
superconducting subgap states in quantitative agreement with the numerical
renormalization group and quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. The solver is based
on the exact diagonalization of a single-impurity Anderson model with
discretized superconducting reservoirs including only a small number of
effective levels. Their energies and couplings to the impurity $d$-level are
chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the
hybridization function. We provide a number of critical benchmarks and
demonstrate the solvers efficiency in combination with the reduced basis method
[Phys. Rev. B 107, 144503 (2023)] by calculating the phase diagram for an
interacting three-terminal junction.

<h3>On temporal entropy and the complexity of computing the expectation  value of local operators after a quench</h3>

<br>

<br>

We study the computational complexity of simulating the time-dependent
expectation value of a local operator in a one-dimensional quantum system by
using temporal matrix product states. We argue that such cost is intimately
related to that of encoding temporal transition matrices and their partial
traces. In particular, we show that we can upper-bound the rank of these
reduced transition matrices by the one of the Heisenberg evolution of local
operators, thus making connection between two apparently different quantities,
the temporal entanglement and the local operator entanglement. As a result,
whenever the local operator entanglement grows slower than linearly in time, we
show that computing time-dependent expectation values of local operators using
temporal matrix product states is likely advantageous with respect to computing
the same quantities using standard matrix product states techniques.

Floppy microscale spring networks are widely studied in theory and
simulations, but no well-controlled experimental system currently exists. Here,
we show that square lattices consisting of colloid-supported lipid bilayers
functionalized with DNA linkers act as microscale floppy spring networks. We
extract their normal modes by inverting the particle displacement correlation
matrix, showing the emergence of a spectrum of soft modes with low effective
stiffness in addition to stiff modes that derive from linker interactions.
Evaluation of the softest mode, a uniform shear mode, reveals that shear
stiffness decreases with lattice size. Experiments match well with Brownian
particle simulations and we develop a theoretical description based on mapping
interactions onto linear response to describe the modes. Our results reveal the
importance of entropic steric effects, and can be used for developing
reconfigurable materials at the colloidal length scale.

<h3>Strain stiffening universality in composite hydrogels and tissues</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11687" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11687</a>
<br>
<i>Jake Song, Elad Deiss-Yehiely, Serra Yesilata, Gareth H. McKinley</i>
<br>
<br>
Soft biological tissues exhibit a remarkable resilience to large mechanical
loads, a property which is associated with the strain stiffening capability of
the biopolymer networks that structurally support the tissues. Yet, recent
studies have shown that composite systems such as tissues and blood clots
exhibit mechanical properties that contradict those of the polymer matrix -
demonstrating stiffening in compression, but softening in shear and tension.
The microscopic basis of this apparent paradox remains poorly understood. We
show that composite hydrogels and tissues do indeed exhibit non-linear elastic
stiffening in shear - which is governed by the stretching of the polymer chains
in the matrix - and that it is driven by the same mechanism that drives
compression stiffening. However, we show that the non-linear elastic stiffening
in composite hydrogels and tissues is masked by mechanical dissipation arising
from filler-polymer interactions known as the Mullins effect, and we introduce
a method to characterize the non-linear elasticity of the composites in
isolation from this overall strain softening response through large-amplitude
oscillatory shear experiments. We present a comprehensive characterization of
the non-linear elastic strain stiffening of composite hydrogels and soft
tissues, and show that the strain stiffening in shear and compression are both
governed by universal strain amplification factors that depend on essential
properties of the composite system, such as the filler concentration and the
filler-polymer interaction strength. These results elucidate the microscopic
mechanisms governing the non-linear mechanics of tissues, which provides design
principles for engineering tissue-mimetic soft materials, and have broad
implications for cell-matrix mechanotransduction in living tissues.

<h3>Electronic and Spin-Orbit Properties of hBN Encapsulated Bilayer  Graphene</h3>

<br>
Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures consisting of Bernal bilayer graphene
(BLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are investigated. By performing
first-principles calculations we capture the essential BLG band structure
features for several stacking and encapsulation scenarios. A low-energy model
Hamiltonian, comprising orbital and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) terms, is
employed to reproduce the hBN-modified BLG dispersion, spin splittings, and
spin expectation values. Most important, the hBN layers open an orbital gap in
the BLG spectrum, which can range from zero to tens of meV, depending on the
precise stacking arrangement of the individual atoms. Therefore, large local
band gap variations may arise in experimentally relevant moir\'{e} structures.
Moreover, the SOC parameters are small (few to tens of $\mu$eV), just as in
bare BLG, but are markedly proximity modified by the hBN layers. Especially
when BLG is encapsulated by monolayers of hBN, such that inversion symmetry is
restored, the orbital gap and spin splittings of the bands vanish. In addition,
we show that a transverse electric field mainly modifies the potential
difference between the graphene layers, which perfectly correlates with the
orbital gap for fields up to about 1~V/nm. Moreover, the layer-resolved Rashba
couplings are tunable by $\sim 5~\mu$eV per V/nm. Finally, by investigating
twisted BLG/hBN structures, with twist angles between 6$^{\circ}$ --
20$^{\circ}$, we find that the global band gap increases linearly with the
twist angle. The extrapolated $0^{\circ}$ band gap is about 23~meV and results
roughly from the average of the stacking-dependent local band gaps. Our
investigations give new insights into proximity spin physics of hBN/BLG
heterostructures, which should be useful for interpreting experiments on
extended as well as confined (quantum dot) systems.

<h3>Reduced collinearity, low-dimensional cluster expansion model for  adsorption of halides (Cl, Br) on Cu(100) surface using principal component  analysis</h3>

<br>
<br>
The cluster expansion model (CEM) provides a powerful computational framework
for rapid estimation of configurational properties in disordered systems.
However, the traditional CEM construction procedure is still plagued by two
fundamental problems: (i) even when only a handful of site cluster types are
included in the model, these clusters can be correlated and therefore they
cannot independently predict the material property, and (ii) typically few
tens-hundreds of datapoints are required for training the model. To address the
first problem of collinearity, we apply the principal component analysis method
for constructing a CEM. Such an approach is shown to result in a
low-dimensional CEM that can be trained using a small DFT dataset. We use the
ab initio thermodynamic modeling of Cl and Br adsorption on Cu(100) surface as
an example to demonstrate these concepts. A key result is that a CEM containing
10 effective cluster interactions build with only 8 DFT energies (note, number
of training configurations > number of principal components) is found to be
accurate and the thermodynamic behavior obtained is consistent with
experiments. This paves the way for construction of high-fidelity CEMs with
sparse/limited DFT data.

<h3>Thermodynamic calculations using reverse Monte Carlo: Simultaneously  tuning multiple short-range order parameters for 2D lattice adsorption  problem</h3>

Lattice simulations are an important class of problems in crystalline solids,
surface science, alloys, adsorption, absorption, separation, catalysis, to name
a few. We describe a fast computational method for performing lattice
thermodynamic calculations that is based on the use of the reverse Monte Carlo
(RMC) technique and multiple short-range order (SRO) parameters. The approach
is comparable in accuracy to the Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) method. The
equilibrium configuration is determined in 5-10 Newton-Raphson iterations by
solving a system of coupled nonlinear algebraic flux equations. This makes the
RMC-based method computationally more efficient than MC, given that MC
typically requires sampling of millions of configurations. The technique is
applied to the interacting 2D adsorption problem. Unlike grand canonical MC,
RMC is found to be adept at tackling geometric frustration, as it is able to
quickly and correctly provide the ordered c(2x2) adlayer configuration for Cl
adsorbed on a Cu (100) surface.

<h3>Mechanical and adsorption properties of greenhouse gases filled carbon  nanotubes</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the mechanical and adsorption properties of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) filled with greenhouse gases through Grand Canonical
Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using a recently
developed parameterization for the cross-terms of the Lenard-Jones (LJ)
potential. Carbon nanotubes interact strongly with CO$_2$ compared to CH$_4$,
resulting in a CO$_2$-rich composition inside the nanotubes, with the
proportion of CO$_2$ decreasing as the diameter of the nanotubes increases.
Contrarily, the smallest nanotubes showed a more even balance between CO$_2$
and CH$_4$ due to gas solidification. The gas does not affect the mechanical
response of the nanotubes under tension, but under compression, it presents a
complex relationship with the loading direction, nanotube's diameters,
chirality, and to a minor extent, the gas composition. Filled zigzag nanotubes
showed to be more stable in the presence of fillers, giving the best mechanical
performance compared to the filled armchairs. The study confirms carbon
nanotubes as effective means of separating CO$_2$ from CH$_4$, presenting good
mechanical stability.

Carbon nanotubes and graphene are promising nanomaterials to improve the
performance of current gas separation membrane technologies. From the molecular
modeling perspective, an accurate description of the interfacial interactions
is mandatory to understand the gas selectivity in these materials. Most of the
molecular dynamics simulations studies considered available force fields with
the standard Lorentz-Berthelot (LB) mixing rules to describe the interaction
among carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$) and carbon structures. We
performed a systematic study in which we showed the LB underestimates the
fluid/solid interaction energies compared to the density functional theory
(DFT) calculation results. To improve the classical description, we propose a
new parametrization for the cross-terms of the Lenard-Jones (LJ) potential by
fitting DFT forces and energies. The obtained model enhanced fluid/carbon
interface description showed excellent transferability between single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene. To investigate the effect of the new
parametrization on the gas structuring within the SWCNTs with varying
diameters, we performed Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. We
observed considerable differences in the CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ density within
SWCNTs compared to those obtained with the standard approach. Our study
highlights the importance of going beyond the traditional Lorentz-Berthelot
mixing rules in the studies involving solid/fluid interfaces of confined
systems.

The electronic structure of short-chain thiophenes (thiophene,
2,2'-bithiophene and 2,2':5',2'-terthiophene) in the gas phase has been
investigated by combining the outcomes of Near-Edge X-ray-Absorption
Fine-Structure (NEXAFS) and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) at the C
K-edge with those of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The
calculated NEXAFS spectra provide a comprehensive description of the main
experimental features and allow their attribution. The evolution of the C1s
NEXAFS spectral features is analyzed as a function of the number of thiophene
rings; a tendency to a stabilization for increasing chain length is found. The
computation of the binding energy allows to assign the experimental XPS peaks
to the different carbon sites on the basis of both the inductive effects
generated by the presence of the S atom as well as of the differential
aromaticity effects.

Synthetic materials and heterostructures obtained by the controlled stacking
of exfoliated monolayers are emerging as attractive functional materials owing
to their highly tunable properties. We present a detailed scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy study of single layer MoS$_2$-on-gold
heterostructures as a function of twist angle. We find that their electronic
properties are determined by the hybridization of the constituent layers and
are modulated at the moir\'e period. The hybridization depends on the layer
alignment and the modulation amplitude vanishes with increasing twist angle. We
explain our observations in terms of a hybridization between the nearest sulfur
and gold atoms, which becomes spatially more homogeneous and weaker as the
moir\'e periodicity decreases with increasing twist angle, unveiling the
possibility of tunable hybridization of electronic states via twist angle
engineering.

The advances in materials and biological sciences have necessitated the use
of molecular simulations to study polymers. The Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulations enable the sampling of relevant microstates of polymeric systems by
traversing paths that are impractical in molecular dynamics simulations.
Several advances in applying Monte Carlo simulations to polymeric systems have
been reported in recent decades. The proposed methods address sampling
challenges encountered in studying different aspects of polymeric systems.
Tracking the above advances has become increasingly challenging due to the
extensive literature generated in the field. Moreover, the incorporation of new
methods in the existing Monte Carlo simulation packages is cumbersome due to
their complexity. Identifying the foundational algorithms that are common to
different methods can significantly ease their implementation and make them
accessible to the broader simulation community. The present chapter classifies
the Monte Carlo methods for polymeric systems based on their objectives and
standard features of their algorithms. We begin the article by providing an
overview of advanced Monte Carlo techniques used for polymeric systems and
their specific applications. We then classify the above techniques into two
broad categories: 1) Monte Carlo moves and 2) Advanced sampling schemes. The
former category is further divided to distinguish the Monte Carlo moves in the
canonical and other ensembles. The advanced sampling schemes attempt to improve
Monte Carlo sampling via approaches other than Monte Carlo moves. We use the
above classification to identify common features of the methods and derive
general expressions that explain their implementation. Such a strategy can help
readers select the methods that are suitable for their study and develop
computer programs that can be easily modified to implement new methods.

<h3>Conserved Quantities in Models of Classical Chaos</h3>

Quantum chaos is a major subject of interest in condensed matter theory, and
has recently motivated new questions in the study of classical chaos. In
particular, recent studies have uncovered interesting physics in the
relationship between chaos and conserved quantities in models of quantum chaos.
In this paper, we investigate this relationship in two simple models of
classical chaos: the infinite-temperature Heisenberg spin chain, and the
directed polymer in a random medium. We relate these models by drawing
analogies between the energy landscape over which the directed polymer moves
and the magnetization of the spin chain. We find that the coupling of the chaos
to these conserved quantities results in, among other things, a marked
transition from the rough perturbation profiles predicted by analogy to the KPZ
equation to smooth, triangular profiles with reduced wandering exponents. These
results suggest that diffusive conserved quantities can, in some cases, be the
dominant forces shaping the development of chaos in classical systems.

<h3>Ab initio investigation of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization of  L1$_0$ FePt: Intensity dependence and importance of electron coherence</h3>

<i>M. S. Mrudul, Peter M. Oppeneer</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the optically-induced demagnetization of
ferromagnetic FePt using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).
We compare the demagnetization mechanism in the perturbative and
nonperturbative limits of light-matter interaction and show how the underlying
mechanism of the ultrafast demagnetization depends on the driving laser
intensity. Our calculations show that the femtosecond demagnetization in TDDFT
is a longitudinal magnetization reduction and results from a nonlinear
optomagnetic effect, akin to the inverse Faraday effect. The demagnetization
scales quadratically with the electric field $E$ in the perturbative limit,
i.e., $\Delta M_z \propto E^{2}$. Moreover, the magnetization dynamics happens
dominantly at even multiples $n\omega_0$, ($n = 0, 2, \cdots$) of the
pump-laser frequency $\omega_0$, whereas odd multiples of $\omega_0$ do not
contribute. We further investigate the demagnetization in conjunction to the
optically-induced change of electron occupations and electron correlations.
Correlations within the Kohn-Sham local-density framework are shown to have an
appreciable yet distinct effect on the amount of demagnetization depending on
the laser intensity. Comparing the ${ab~initio}$ computed demagnetizations with
those calculated from spin occupations, we show that electronic coherence plays
a dominant role in the demagnetization process, whereas interpretations based
on the time-dependent occupation numbers poorly describe the ultrafast
demagnetization.

<h3>Signature of nodal topology in nonlinear quantum transport across  junctions in Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate quantum transport through a rectangular potential barrier in
Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (MSMs), within the framework
of Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Our study uncovers the role of nodal topology
imprinted in the electric current and the shot noise. We find that, in contrast
to the finite odd-order conductance and noise power, the even-order
contributions vanish at the nodes. Additionally, depending on the topological
charge ($J$), the linear conductance ($G_1$) scales with the Fermi energy
($E_F$) as $G_1^{E_F>U}\propto E_F^{2/J}$. We demonstrate that the
$E_F$-dependence of the second-order conductance and shot noise power could
quite remarkably distinguish an MSM from a WSM depending on the band topology,
and may induce several smoking gun experiments in nanostructures made out of
WSMs and MSMs. Analyzing shot noise and Fano factor, we show that the transport
across the rectangular barrier follows the sub-Poissonian statistics.
Interestingly, we obtain universal values of Fano factor at the nodes unique to
their topological charges. The universality for a fixed $J$, however, indicates
that only a fixed number of open channels participate in the transport through
evanescent waves at the nodes. The proposed results can serve as a potential
diagnostic tool to identify different topological systems in experiments.

<br>
Polyhydride superconductors have been shown to possess metallic properties
with a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-type superconducting ground state. Here, we
provide evidence for unconventional transport associated with a pseudogap phase
in cubic cerium superhydride CeH$_{10}$ ($\textit{T}$$_C$ = 116 K) at pressure
of 115-125 GPa. A large negative magnetoresistance in the non-superconducting
state below 90 K, quasi $\textit{T}$-linear electrical resistance, and a
sign-change of its temperature dependence mark the emergence of this phase. We
studied the magnetic phase diagrams and the upper critical fields
$\textit{B}$$_{C2}$(T) of CeH$_{10}$, CeH$_9$, and CeD$_9$ in pulsed fields up
to 70 T. $\textit{B}$$_{C2}$(T) of CeH$_9$ and CeD$_9$ exhibits pronounced
saturation at low temperatures in accordance with the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, whereas CeH$_{10}$ stands out in particular,
as it does not obey this model. Our observations, therefore, reveal the
unconventional nature of non-superconducting state of cerium superhydride
CeH$_{10}$.

The paradox of Bose-Einstein condensation is that phenomena such as the
$\lambda$-transition heat capacity and superfluid flow are macroscopic, whereas
the occupancy of the ground state is microscopic. This contradiction is
resolved with a simple derivation for ideal bosons that shows Bose-Einstein
condensation is into multiple low-lying states, not just the ground state.
