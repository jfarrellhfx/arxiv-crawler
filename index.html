<h3>Classical and Quantum Theory of Fluctuations for Many-Particle Systems  out of Equilibrium</h3>

<i>Erik Schroedter, Michael Bonitz</i>
<p>Correlated classical and quantum many-particle systems out of equilibrium are
of high interest in many fields, including dense plasmas, correlated solids,
and ultracold atoms. Accurate theoretical description of these systems is
challenging both, conceptionally and with respect to computational resources.
While for classical systems, in principle, exact simulations are possible via
molecular dynamics, this is not the case for quantum systems. Alternatively,
one can use many-particle approaches such as hydrodynamics, kinetic theory or
nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF). However, NEGF exhibit a very unfavorable
cubic scaling of the CPU time with the number of time steps. An alternative is
the G1--G2 scheme [N. Schl\"unzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{124}, 076601
(2020)] which allows for NEGF simulations with time linear scaling, however, at
the cost of large memory consumption. The reason is the need to store the
two-particle correlation function. This problem can be overcome for a number of
approximations by reformulating the kinetic equations in terms of fluctuations
-- an approach that was developed, for classical systems, by Yu.L. Klimontovich
[JETP \textbf{33}, 982 (1957)]. Here we present an overview of his ideas and
extend them to quantum systems. In particular, we demonstrate that this quantum
fluctuations approach can reproduce the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation [E.
Schroedter \textit{et al.}, Cond. Matt. Phys. \textbf{25}, 23401 (2022)]
promising high accuracy at low computational cost which arises from an
effective semiclassical stochastic sampling procedure. We also demonstrate how
to extend the approach to the two-time exchange-correlation functions and the
density response properties. [E. Schroedter \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B

<h3>Kink-pair mechanism and low temperature flow-stress behaviour of  strontium titanate single crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05124</a>
<br>
<i>M. Castillo-Rodríguez, W. Sigle</i>
<p>The mechanical behaviour of strontium titanate exhibits a remarkable
behaviour at low temperature, in the so called regime A, where the flow stress
experiences two different temperature dependences separated by a noticeably
abrupt drop in between. The dislocation microstructure was investigated and, by
making adequate use of the kink-pair model, we interpret this behaviour as a
transition from the short- to the long-segment limit of kink-pair formation.
The fit parameters are found to be physically sound.

<h3>Altermagnetism from coincident Van Hove singularities: application to  $κ$-Cl</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05180" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05180</a>
<br>
<i>Yue Yu, Han-Gyeol Suh, Mercè Roig, Daniel F. Agterberg</i>
<p>Realizing two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets is important for spintronics
applications. Here we propose a microscopic template for stabilizing 2D
altermagnetism through Van Hove singularities that are coincident in both
energy and momentum. These coincident Van Hove singularities are a generic
consequence of non-symmorphic symmetries in 8 2D space groups. They allow new
hopping interactions between the Van Hove singularities that do not appear in
analogous Van-Hove singularity based patch models for cuprates and graphene. We
show these new interactions can give rise to various weak coupling, and
BCS-based instabilities, including altermagnetism, nematicity, inter-band
d-wave superconductivity, and orbital altermagnetic order. We apply our results
to quasi-2D organic $\kappa$-Cl in which altermagnetism is known to appear.

<h3>Numerically efficient unitary evolution for Hamiltonians beyond  nearest-neighbors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05198" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05198</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Giuseppe Catalano</i>
<p>Matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are
fundamental tools in the study of quantum many-body systems, particularly in
the context of tensor network methods such as Time-Evolving Block Decimation
(TEBD). However, constructing compact MPO representations for Hamiltonians with
interactions beyond nearest-neighbors, such as those arising in AMO systems or
in systems with ring geometry, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for the direct construction of compact MPOs tailored
specifically for the exponential of spin Hamiltonians. This approach allows for
a more efficient time evolution, using TEBD, of spin systems with interactions
beyond nearest-neighbors, such as long-range spin-chains, periodic systems and
more complex cluster model, with interactions involving more than two spins.

<h3>Are LLMs Ready for Real-World Materials Discovery?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05200" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05200</a>
<br>
<i>Santiago Miret, N M Anoop Krishnan</i>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) create exciting possibilities for powerful
language processing tools to accelerate research in materials science. While
LLMs have great potential to accelerate materials understanding and discovery,
they currently fall short in being practical materials science tools. In this
position paper, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science
that reveal current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning
over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given those
shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs
(MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis
generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant
MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets
sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction
challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information
extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale,
multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge.
Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world
materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated
In-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials
Laboratories.

<h3>Validation Workflow for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for  Complex Ceramics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05222" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05222</a>
<br>
<i>Kimia Ghaffari, Salil Bavdekar, Douglas E. Spearot, Ghatu Subhash</i>
<p>The number of published Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) has
increased significantly in recent years. These new data-driven potential energy
approximations often lack the physics-based foundations that inform many
traditionally-developed interatomic potentials and hence require robust
validation methods for their applicability, accuracy, computational efficiency,
and transferability to the intended applications. This work presents a
sequential, three-stage workflow for MLIP validation: (i) preliminary
validation, (ii) static property prediction, and (iii) dynamic property
prediction. This material-agnostic procedure is demonstrated in a
tutorial-approach for the development of a robust MLIP for boron carbide (B4C),
a widely employed, structurally complex ceramic that undergoes a deleterious
deformation mechanism called "amorphization" under high pressure loading. It is
shown that the resulting B4C MLIP offers a more accurate prediction of
properties and behaviors with increased computational efficiency compared to
the available ReaxFF potential.

<h3>Large unconventional anomalous Hall effect arising from spin chirality  within domain walls of an antiferromagnet EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05237" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05237</a>
<br>
<i>Karan Singh, Orest Pavlosiuk, Shovan Dan, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Piotr Wiśniewski</i>
<p>Unconventional anomalous Hall effect was observed in antiferromagnetic state
of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$. Scaling of unconventional Hall conductivity with the
longitudinal conductivity, and the magnitude of Hall angle indicate spin
chirality despite collinear magnetic structure. Anomalies in magnetoresistance
culminate in the same fields, in which the unconventional anomalous Hall
resistance has maxima. Monotonous decrease of their magnitude with increasing
temperature belittles here the role of spin-fluctuations, important in
isostructural compounds. These observations point to a prominent role of scalar
spin chirality within domain walls, when magnetic field tilts the Eu moments.
Simple calculation of such spin chirality shows it strongest in fields
characteristic for anomalous magnetotransport.

<h3>Controlling the orbital Hall effect in gapped bilayer graphene in the  terahertz regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05241" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05241</a>
<br>
<i>Tarik P. Cysne, W. J. M. Kort-Kamp, Tatiana G. Rappoport</i>
<p>We study the orbital Hall effect (OHE) in the AC regime using bilayer
graphene (BLG) as a prototypical material platform. While the unbiased BLG has
gapless electronic spectra, applying a perpendicular electric field creates an
energy band gap that can be continuously tuned from zero to high values. By
exploiting this flexibility, we demonstrate the ability to control the behavior
of AC orbital Hall conductivity. Particularly, we demonstrate that the orbital
Hall conductivity at the neutrality point changes its signal at a critical
frequency, the value of which is proportional to the perpendicular electric
field. For BLG with narrow band gaps, the active frequency region for the AC
OHE may extend to a few terahertz, which is experimentally accessible with
current technologies. We also consider the introduction of a perpendicular
magnetic field in the weak coupling regime using first-order perturbation
theory to illustrate how the breaking of time-reversal symmetry enables the
emergence of AC charge Hall effect in the charge-doped situation and modifies
the AC orbital Hall conductivity. Our calculations suggest that BLG with narrow
bandgaps is a practical candidate for investigating time-dependent orbital
angular momentum transport.

<h3>Are magnetic monopoles at the origin of magneto-electricity in spin  ices?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05260</a>
<br>
<i>Y. Alexanian, J. Scoarnec, C. Decorse, J. Robert, R. Ballou, E. Lhotel, J. Debray, F. Gay, V. Simonet, S. de Brion</i>
<p>The possibilities of combining several degreesof freedom inside a unique
material have recently been highlighted in their dynamics and proposed as
information carriers in quantum devices where their cross-manipulation by
external parameters such as electric and magnetic fields could enhance their
functionalities. An emblematic example is that of electromagnons, spin-waves
dressed with electric dipoles, that are fingerprints of multiferroics.
Point-like objects have also been identified, which may take the form of
excited quasiparticles. This is the case for magnetic monopoles, the exotic
excitations of spin ices, that have been recently proposed to carry an electric
dipole although experimental evidences remain elusive. Presently, we
investigate the electrical signature of a classical spin ice and a related
compound that supports quantum fluctuations. Our in-depth study clearly
attributes magnetoelectricity to the correlated spin ice phase distinguishing
it from extrinsic and single-ion effects. Our calculations show that the
proposed model conferring magnetoelectricity to monopoles is not sufficient,
calling for higher order contributions.

<h3>Impact of impurities on the topological boundaries and edge state  localization in a staggered chain of atoms: SSH model and its topoelectrical  circuit realization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05261</a>
<br>
<i>Julio César Pérez-Pedraza, José Eduardo Barrios-Vargas, Alfredo Raya</i>
<p>We study the Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model, perhaps the simplest realization of
a topological insulator, in the presence of an embedded impurity superlattice.
We consider the impact of the said impurity by changing the hopping amplitudes
between them and their nearest neighbors in the topological boundaries and the
edge state localization in the chain of atoms. Within a tight-binding approach
and through a topolectrical circuit simulation, we consider three different
impurity-hopping amplitudes. We found a relaxation of the condition between
hopping parameters for the topologically trivial and non-trivial phase boundary
and a more profound edge state localization given by the impurity position
within the supercell.

<h3>Prediction of $s^\pm$-wave superconductivity enhanced by electronic  doping in trilayer nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05285" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05285</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<p>Motivated by the recently reported signatures of superconductivity in
trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure, we comprehensively study this
system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Without
electronic interactions, the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals show a
bonding-antibonding and nonbonding splitting behavior via the O $p_z$ orbital
inducing a ``trimer'' lattice in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, analogous to the dimers
of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. The Fermi surface consists of three electron sheets
with mixed $e_g$ orbitals, and a hole and an electron pocket made up of the
$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, suggesting a Ni two-orbital minimum model. In addition,
we find that superconducting pairing is induced in the $s_{\pm}$-wave channel
due to partial nesting between the {\bf M}=$(\pi, \pi)$ centered pockets and
portions of the Fermi surface centered at the {\bf $\Gamma$}=$(0, 0)$ point.
With changing electronic density $n$, the $s^\pm$ instability remains leading
and its pairing strength shows a dome-like behavior with a maximum around $n =
4.2$ ($\sim 6.7\%$ electron doping). The superconducting instability disappears
at the same electronic density of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ correlated with the absence
of the $\gamma$ pocket, suggesting that the superconductivity of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ does not originate from trilayer- and single-layer structure.
Furthermore, we predict an interesting spin-density-wave state in
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with an in-plane ($\pi$, $\pi$) order and
antiferromagnetic coupling between the top and bottom Ni layers, while the
middle layer has spin zero.

<h3>Hot Carriers from Intra- and Interband Transitions in Gold-Silver Alloy  Nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05292" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05292</a>
<br>
<i>Shreyas Ramachandran, Simao Joao, Hanwen Jin, Johannes Lischner</i>
<p>Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface
plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed for applications in solar
energy conversion and sensing. In this paper, we study the generation of hot
carriers in large spherical gold-silver alloy nanoparticles using a recently
developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of Maxwell's
equations with large-scale tight-binding simulations. We find that hot-carrier
properties depend sensitively on the alloy composition. Specifically,
nanoparticles with a large gold fraction produce hot carriers under visible
light illumination while nanoparticles with a large silver fraction require
higher photon energies to produce hot carriers. Moreover, most hot carriers in
nanoparticles with a large gold fraction originate from interband transitions
which give rise to energetic holes and "cold" electrons near the Fermi level.
Increasing the silver fraction enhances the generation rate of hot carriers
from intraband transitions which produce energetic electrons and "cold" holes.
These findings demonstrate that alloy composition is a powerful tuning
parameter for the design of nanoparticles for applications in solar energy
conversion and sensing that require precise control of hot-carrier properties.

<h3>Permanently densified SiO$_2$ glasses: a structural approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05311</a>
<br>
<i>Christine Martinet, Assia Kassir-Bodon, Thierry Deschamps, Antoine Cornet, Sylvie Le Floch, Valerie Martinez, Bernard Champagnon</i>
<p>Densified silica can be obtained by different pressure and temperature paths
and for different stress conditions, hydrostatic or including shear. The
density is usually the macroscopic parameter used to characterize the different
compressed silica samples. The aim of our present study is to compare
structural modifications for silica glass, densified from several routes. For
this, densified silica glasses are prepared from cold and high temperature (up
to 1020 $^\circ$C) compressions. The different densified glasses obtained in
our study are characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Intertetrahedral
angles from the main band relative to the bending mode decreases and their
values are larger for densified samples from high temperature compression than
those samples from cold compression. The relative amount of 3-membered rings
deduced from the D2 line area increases as a function of density for cold
compression. The temperature increase during the compression process induces a
decrease of the 3 fold ring population. Moreover, 3 fold rings are more
deformed and stressed for densified samples at room temperature at the expense
of those densified at high temperature. Temperature plays a main role in the
reorganization structure during the densification and leads to obtaining a more
relaxed structure with lower stresses than glasses densified from cold
compression. The role of hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic applied stresses on the
glass structure is discussed. From the Sen and Thorpe central force model,
intertetrahedral angle average value and their distribution are estimated.

<h3>Antiferromagnetism in two-dimensional materials: progress and  computational challenges</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05313" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05313</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Olsen</i>
<p>We present a perspective on the status of antiferromagnetism in
two-dimensional (2D) materials. Various types of spin-compensated orders are
discussed and include non-collinear order, spin spirals and altermagnetism.
Spin-orbit effects ultimately determine, whether compounds exhibit long range
order, Kosterlitz-Thouless physics, or multiferroic properties and we discuss
the basic magnetic prototypes that may arise in 2D materials depending on the
magnetic anisotropy and ordering vector. A summary of 2D antiferromagnets that
have been characterized experimentally is provided - with particular emphasis
on magnetic anisotropies and Neel temperatures. We then outline the ingredients
needed to describe the magnetic properties using density functional theory. In
particular, the systematic determination of magnetic ground states from the
generalized Bloch theorem and the magnetic force theorem, which may be used to
calculate magnetic excitations from the Heisenberg model with parameters
determined from first principles. The methods are exemplified by application to
the monolayer helimagnet NiBr$_2$. Finally, we present a summary of predicted
and prospective 2D antiferromagnets and discuss the challenges associated with
the prediction of N\'eel temperatures from first principles.

<h3>Phonon Modal Analysis of Thermal Transport in ThO2 with Point Defects  using Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05325</a>
<br>
<i>Beihan Chen, Linu Malakkal, Marat Khafizov, David H. Hurley, Miaomiao Jin</i>
<p>In this study, we investigate how point defects in ThO2, an advanced nuclear
fuel as well as a surrogate for other fluorite structured materials, affect
phonon mode-resolved thermal transport based on extensive equilibrium molecular
dynamics. By incorporating the normal modes from lattice dynamics, we decompose
the trajectory and heat flux to normal mode space and extract key phonon
properties, including phonon relaxation times and their contributions to
thermal conductivity. Two types of theories are applied: one obtains phonon
relaxation times and spectral conductivity via the Boltzmann transport equation
and normal mode analysis, while the other applies the Green-Kubo theory for
modal analysis. Both approaches enable us to evaluate the effects of four types
of point defects. The strongest impact to a reduction in thermal conductivity
is from Th interstitial, followed by Th vacancy, and O defects of similar
magnitude, consistent with previous theoretical calculations.

<h3>3D ferroelectric phase field simulations of polycrystalline multi-phase  hafnia and zirconia based ultra-thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05331</a>
<br>
<i>Prabhat Kumar, Michael Hoffmann, Andrew Nonaka, Sayeef Salahuddin</i>
<p>HfO$_2$- and ZrO$_2$-based ferroelectric thin films have emerged as promising
candidates for the gate oxides of next generation electronic devices. Recent
work has experimentally demonstrated that a tetragonal/orthorhombic (t/o-)
phase mixture with partially in-plane polarization can lead to negative
capacitance (NC) stabilization. However, there is a discrepancy between
experiments and the theoretical understanding of domain formation and domain
wall motion in these multi-phase, polycrystalline materials. Furthermore, the
effect of anisotropic domain wall coupling on NC has not been studied so far.
Here we apply 3D phase field simulations of HfO$_2$- and ZrO$_2$-based
mixed-phase ultra-thin films on silicon to understand the necessary and
beneficial conditions for NC stabilization. We find that smaller ferroelectric
grains and a larger angle of the polar axis with respect to the out-of-plane
direction enhances the NC effect. Furthermore, we show that theoretically
predicted negative domain wall coupling even along only one axis prevents NC
stabilization. Therefore, we conclude that topological domain walls play a
critical role in experimentally observed NC phenomena in HfO$_2$- and
ZrO$_2$-based ferroelectrics.

<h3>Absence of breakdown of ferrodark solitons exhibiting snake instability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05351" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05351</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoquan Yu, P. B. Blakie</i>
<p>We investigate the dynamical stability and real time dynamics of the
two-types of ferrodark solitons (FDSs) which occur as topological magnetic
domain walls in the easy-plane phase of a quasi-two-dimensional (2D)
ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The type-I FDS has positive
inertial mass and exhibits a single dynamical instability that generates in
plane spin winding, causing polar-core spin vortex dipoles. The positive
inertial mass leads to the elastic oscillations of the soliton under transverse
perturbations. The type-II FDS has negative inertial mass and exhibits a snake
instability and a spin-twist instability, with the latter involving the
generation of out of plane spin winding. Distinct from the normal dynamics of
negative mass solitons under long wave length transverse perturbations, the
snake instability does not lead to the type-II FDS breaking down. Instead,
segments of the type-II FDS convert to type-I and mass vortex dipoles are
produced. The resulting hybridized-chain of the two soliton types and vortices
exhibits complex 2D soliton dynamics at long times while the vortices remain
confined and the topological structure of a magnetic domain wall is preserved.

<h3>Block Mott insulating state induced by next-nearest neighbor hopping in  the S = 3/2 zigzag chain BaCoTe2O7</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05389" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05389</a>
<br>
<i>Ling-Fang Lin, Yang Zhang, Gonzalo Alvarez, Adriana Moreo, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<p>Quasi-one-dimensional correlated electronic multi-orbital systems with either
ladder or chain geometries continue attracting considerable interest due to
their complex electronic phases arising from the interplay of the hopping
matrix, the crystal-fields splitting, the electronic correlations, and strong
quantum fluctuations. Recently, the intriguing cobalt zigzag chain system
BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$, with electronic density $n = 7$, was prepared experimentally.
Here, we systematically study the electronic and magnetic properties of this
quasi-one-dimensional compound from the theory perspective. Based on
first-principles density functional theory calculations, strongly anisotropic
one-dimensional electronic Co $3d$ bands were found near the Fermi level. By
evaluating the relevant hopping amplitudes, we provide the magnitude and origin
of the nearest-neighbor (NN) and next nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping matrices
in BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$. With this information, we constructed a three-orbital
electronic Hubbard model for this zigzag chain system, and studied two cases:
with only a NN hopping matrix, and with NN plus NNN hopping matrices.
Introducing the Hubbard and Hund couplings and studying the model via the
density matrix renormalization group method, we constructed the ground-state
phase diagram. A robust staggered antiferromagnetic (AFM) region was found when
only the NN hopping matrix in the chain direction was employed. However, for
the realistic case where the NNN hopping matrix is also included, the dominant
state becomes instead a block AFM order, in agreement with experiments. The
system displays Mott insulator characteristics with three half-filled orbitals,
when the block AFM order is stable. Our results for BaCoTe$_2$O$_7$ provide
guidance to experimentalists and theorists working on this zigzag
one-dimensional chain and related materials.

<h3>Splitting probabilities are optimal controllers of rare reactive events</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05414</a>
<br>
<i>Aditya N. Singh, David T. Limmer</i>
<p>The committor constitutes the primary quantity of interest within chemical
kinetics as it is understood to encode the ideal reaction coordinate for a rare
reactive event. We show the generative utility of the committor, in that it can
be used explicitly to produce a reactive trajectory ensemble that exhibits
numerically exact statistics as that of the original transition path ensemble.
This is done by relating a time-dependent analogue of the committor that solves
a generalized bridge problem, to the splitting probability that solves a
boundary value problem under a bistable assumption. By invoking stochastic
optimal control and spectral theory, we derive a general form for the optimal
controller of a bridge process that connects two metastable states expressed in
terms of the splitting probability. This formalism offers an alternative
perspective into the role of the committor and its gradients, in that they
encode forcefields that guarantee reactivity, generating trajectories that are
statistically identical to the way that a system would react autonomously.

<p>BiFeO$_3$ is a multiferroic material featuring ferroelectricity and
noncollinear antiferromagnetism, the latter manifested as a cycloid of spin
density. Definitive and efficient control of the characteristic spin texture of
BiFeO$_3$ is attractive for emerging quantum devices. In this regard,
crystal-field $d\rightarrow d$ excitations localized on Fe atomic sites in
BiFeO$_3$ provide an avenue for manipulation of the spin texture as they induce
a complex interplay among the spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. In
this work, the ab initio GW-BSE method is used to characterize these
excitations within the exciton picture. We find that the $d-d$ transitions
appear as strongly bound chiral spin-flip excitons deep within the electronic
band gap as a result of the intricate competition between the lattice
potential, the antiferromagnetic ordering, the spin-orbit coupling, and the
electron-hole interaction. Most crucially, these excitons are composed of
electron-hole pairs with opposite spins constituting their $\pm \hbar$ angular
momentum. Excitons with a specific angular momentum can be selectively excited
using circularly polarized light, consequently modulating the local magnetic
moment to give rise to transient ferrimagnetism.

<h3>Effective model and $s_\pm$-wave superconductivity in trilayer nickelate  La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</h3>

<p>The recent discovery of bulk superconductivity in trilayer nickelate
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with the critical temperature $T_c$ near $30$K under high
pressure is attracting a new wave of research interest, after the breakthrough
of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_c$ near $80$K. The similarities and
differences of electronic structure and superconducting mechanism in these two
systems are urgent theoretical issues. In this Letter, we study the electronic
band structure and construct a minimal trilayer tight-binding model for the
high-pressure phase of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in terms of the nickel
$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, and study the superconducting
mechanism due to local Coulomb interactions by the unbiased functional
renormalization group. We find antiferromagnetic correlations between the outer
layers instead of neighboring ones, apart from the inplane correlations. The
effective interaction induces Cooper pairing with the $s_\pm$-wave symmetry,
which changes sign across the Fermi pockets. We find $T_c$ in
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is systematically lower than that in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

<h3>Quantum Melting of a Disordered Wigner Solid</h3>

<p>The behavior of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in extreme coupling
limits are reasonably well-understood, but our understanding of intermediate
region remains limited. Strongly interacting electrons crystalize into a solid
phase known as the Wigner crystal at very low densities, and these evolve to a
Fermi liquid at high densities. At intermediate densities, however, where the
Wigner crystal melts into a strongly correlated electron fluid that is poorly
understood partly due to a lack of microscopic probes for delicate quantum
phases. Here we report the first imaging of a disordered Wigner solid and its
quantum densification and quantum melting behavior in a bilayer MoSe2 using a
non-invasive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) technique. We observe a Wigner
solid with nanocrystalline domains pinned by local disorder at low hole
densities. With slightly increasing electrostatic gate voltages, the holes are
added quantum mechanically during the densification of the disordered Wigner
solid. As the hole density is increased above a threshold (p ~ 5.7 * 10e12
(cm-2)), the Wigner solid is observed to melt locally and create a mixed phase
where solid and liquid regions coexist. With increasing density, the liquid
regions gradually expand and form an apparent percolation network. Local solid
domains appear to be pinned and stabilized by local disorder over a range of
densities. Our observations are consistent with a microemulsion picture of
Wigner solid quantum melting where solid and liquid domains emerge
spontaneously and solid domains are pinned by local disorder.

<p>We study four double-gyroid (DG) grain boundaries (GBs) with different
orientations numerically using the Landau--Brazovskii free energy, including
the (422) twin boundary studied recently, a network switching GB, and two tilt
GBs. Topological variations and geometric deformations are investigated. It is
found that deviations in strut lengths and dihedral angles from the bulk DG
substantially exceed changes in strut angles and nodal coplanarity. We also
examine the spectra along the contact plane of two grains and utilize them to
evaluate the GB widths. Of the four GBs we study, the network switching GB
changes to the least extent topologically and geometrically, meanwhile has the
lowest energy and the smallest GB width.

<h3>Assessing the atomic moment picture of spin dynamics: the perspective of  \textit{ab initio} magnon wavefunction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05473" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05473</a>
<br>
<i>Yihao Lin, Ji Feng</i>
<p>Our understanding of collective spin fluctuation in materials relies largely
on Heisenberg-type spin Hamiltonians. Implicit in these spin models is the
atomic moment picture that in transverse spin dynamics the magnetization around
an atom undergoes precessional motion as a rigid moment, which has been
challenged by emerging theoretical and experimental advances.To assess the
validity of the atomic moment picture in spin dynamics, however, necessitates
magnon wavefunctions from \textit{ab initio} methods without \textit{a priori}
spin models.To this end, we develop an efficient model-free {\it ab initio}
method for computing magnon spectrum and wavefunctions. Niu-Kleinman's
adiabatic spin-wave dynamics is reformulated using linear perturbation theory
into a generalized eigenvalue problem, which can be solved to produce magnon
spectrum and wavefunctions without assuming atomic moments. We have implemented
this method in the framework of density functional perturbation theory (DFPT).
A dynamical extension of Niu-Kleinman equation of motion is proposed to improve
inaccurate predicted magnon energies due to imperfect adiabaticity at higher
energies. Based on so-obtained {\it ab initio} magnon wavefunctions, we find
the atomic moment picture to be valid in typical ferromagnets and
antiferromagnets, but fails in the molecular orbital crystal Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Our
results suggest that the usual spin Hamiltonian approach should be taken with a
grain of salt, and possible experimental ramification on the issue is
discussed.

<h3>Magnetic field effects on the Kitaev model coupled to environment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05516" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05516</a>
<br>
<i>Kiyu Fukui, Yasuyuki Kato, Yukitoshi Motome</i>
<p>Open quantum systems display unusual phenomena not seen in closed systems,
such as new topological phases and unconventional phase transitions. An
interesting example was studied for a quantum spin liquid in the Kitaev model
[K. Yang, S. C. Morampudi, and E. J. Bergholtz, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 126}$,
077201 (2021)]; an effective non-Hermitian Kitaev model, which incorporates
dissipation effects, was shown to give rise to a gapless spin liquid state with
exceptional points in the Majorana dispersions. Given that an external magnetic
field induces a gapped Majorana topological state in the Hermitian case, the
exceptional points may bring about intriguing quantum phenomena under a
magnetic field. Here we investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev model perturbed by
the magnetic field. We show that the exceptional points remain gapless up to a
finite critical magnetic field, in stark contrast to the Hermitian case where
an infinitesimal field opens a gap. The gapless state is stable over a wide
range of the magnetic field for some particular parameter sets, and in special
cases, undergoes topological transitions to another gapless state with
different winding number around the exceptional points without opening a gap.
In addition, in the system with edges, we find that the non-Hermitian skin
effect is induced by the magnetic field, even for the parameters where the skin
effect is absent at zero field. The chirality of edge states is switched
through the exceptional points, similarly to the surface Fermi arcs connected
by the Weyl points in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals. Our results provide a
new possible route to stabilize topological gapless quantum spin liquids under
the magnetic field in the presence of dissipation.

<br>
<i>F Adersh, M Muhsin, M Sahoo</i>
<p>We investigate the self-propulsion of an inertial active particle confined in
a two-dimensional harmonic trap. The particle is suspended in a non-Newtonian
or viscoelastic suspension with a friction kernel that decays exponentially
with a time constant characterizing the memory timescale or transient
elasticity of the medium. By solving the associated non-Markovian dynamics, we
identify two regimes in parameter space distinguishing the oscillatory and
non-oscillatory behavior of the particle motion. By simulating the particle
trajectories and exactly calculating the steady state probability distribution
functions and mean square displacement, interestingly, we observe that with an
increase in the memory time scale, the elastic bound of suspension dominates
over the influence of harmonic trap. As a consequence, the particle can escape
out of the trap without approaching steady state. On the other hand, with an
increase in the duration of the activity, the particle becomes trapped by the
harmonic confinement.

<h3>Understanding electronic excited states in BiFeO$_3$ via ab initio  calculations and symmetry analysis</h3>

<i>Aseem Rajan Kshirsagar, Sven Reichardt</i>
<p>BiFeO$_3$ is a technologically relevant multiferroic perovskite featuring
ferroelectricity and antiferrromagnetism. Optical excitations in BiFeO$_3$ can
couple with its lattice, magnetic and ferroelectic degrees of freedoms, and
hold potential of probing and controlling them. In this work, ab initio density
functional theory and GW-BSE methods are combined with an extensive symmetry
and atomic orbital analysis of electronic states to describe the electronic
structure and the optical spectra of BiFeO$_3$ with quantitative accuracy and
qualitative insights. We find that spin-flip $d-d$ transitions localized on Fe
atomic sites contribute to several in-gap features in the optical spectra of
BiFeO$_3$. Our analysis provides a nuanced description of the crystal field
splitting of Fe-$3d$ orbitals in the context of a specific crystal symmetry and
its effect on the composition of these exciton states. Using symmetry analysis,
we thoroughly explain how the spin-content and the splitting of energies of
these excitons are dictated by an interplay between crystal symmetry, excitonic
effects, and spin-orbit coupling.

<br>
<i>Harukuni Ikeda</i>
<p>In a recent preprint, ``A new universality class describes Vicsek's flocking
phase in physical dimensions'', Patrick Jentsch and Chiu Fan Lee have computed
the critical exponents of the Vicsek model in the ordered phase by means of
functional renormalization group methods. In this note, we compare their
results with our previous theoretical predictions for the Vicsek model, which
is expected to be exact in $d=2$ dimensions. We point out that the critical
exponents predicted by the two theories are extremely close in both $d=2$ and
$3$ dimensions. We found that both theories fit the current numerical data
equally well. Extensive numerical simulations for larger system sizes are thus
highly desirable to judge which theory is correct.

<i>D. A. Miranda T. V. C. Antão, N.M.R Peres</i>
<p>In this paper we discussed the topological transition between trivial and
nontrivial phases of a quasi-periodic (Aubry-Andr\'e like) mechanical
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We find that there exists a nontrivial
boundary separating the two topological phases and an analytical expression for
this boundary is found. We discuss the localization of the vibrational modes
using the calculation of the inverse participation ratio (IPR) and access the
localization nature of the states of the system. We find three different
regimes: extended, localized, and critical, depending on the intensity of the
Aubry-Andr\'e spring. We further study the energy dependent mobility edge (ME)
separating localized from extended eigenstates and find its analytical
expression for both commensurate and incommensurate modulation wavelengths,
thus enlarging the library of models possessing analytical expressions for the
ME. Our results extend previous results for the theory of fermionic topological
insulators and localization theory in quantum matter to the classical realm.

<h3>Bias induced circular current in a loop nanojunction with AAH  modulation: Role of hopping dimerization</h3>

<br>
<i>Moumita Mondal, Santanu K. Maiti</i>
<p>In this work, we put forward, for the first time, the interplay between
correlated disorder and hopping dimerization on bias driven circular current in
a loop conductor that is clamped between two electrodes. The correlated
disorder is introduced in site energies of the ring in the form of
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model. Simulating the quantum system within a
tight-binding framework all the results are worked out based on the standard
wave-guide theory. Unlike transport current, commonly referred to drain
current, circular current in the loop conductor can get enhanced with
increasing disorder strength. This enhancement becomes much effective when
hopping dimerization is included which is taken following the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. The characteristic features of bias driven
circular current are studied under different input conditions and we find the
results are robust for wide range of physical parameters. Our analysis may
provide a new insight in analyzing transport behavior in different disordered
lattices in presence of additional restrictions in hopping integrals.

<h3>A Mechanical Origin of Cooperative Transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05659" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05659</a>
<br>
<i>Eden Arbel, Naomi Oppenheimer, Yoav Lahini, Matan Yah Ben Zion</i>
<p>Cooperative transport is a striking phenomenon where multiple agents join
forces to transit a payload too heavy for the individual. While social animals
such as ants are routinely observed to coordinate transport at scale,
reproducing the effect in artificial swarms remains challenging, as it requires
synchronization in a noisy many-body system. Here we show that cooperative
transport spontaneously emerges in swarms of stochastic self-propelled agents,
without requiring any form of sensing, feedback, or control. We find that a
minute modification to the mechanical design of the individual agent
dramatically changes its alignment response to an external force. We then show
experimentally that with the proper design, a swarm of active particles
spontaneously cooperates in the directional transport of larger objects.
Surprisingly, transport increases with increasing payload size. A mechanical,
coarse-grained description reveals that force-alignment is intrinsic and
captured by a signed, charge-like parameter with units of curvature. Numerical
simulations of swarms of active particles with a negative active charge
corroborate the experimental findings. We analytically derive a geometrical
criterion for cooperative transport which results from a bifurcation in a
non-linear dynamical system. Our findings generalize existing models of active
particles, offer new design rules for distributed robotic systems, and shed
light on cooperation in natural swarms.

<h3>What is the best simulation approach for measuring local density  fluctuations near solvo/hydrophobes?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05692" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05692</a>
<br>
<i>Nigel B. Wilding, Robert Evans, Francesco Turci</i>
<p>Measurements of local density fluctuations are crucial to characterizing the
interfacial properties of equilibrium fluids. A specific case that has been
well-explored involves the heightened compressibility of water near hydrophobic
entities. Commonly, a spatial profile of local fluctuation strength is
constructed from measurements of the mean and variance of solvent particle
number fluctuations in a set of contiguous sub-volumes of the system adjacent
to the solvo/hydrophobe. An alternative measure proposed by Evans and Stewart
(J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 27, 194111 (2015)) defines a local compressibility
profile in terms of the chemical potential derivative of the spatial number
density profile. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation, we compare and
contrast the efficacy of these two approaches for a Lennard-Jones solvent at
spherical and planar solvophobic interfaces, and SPC/E water at a hydrophobic
spherical solute. Our principal findings are that: (i) the local
compressibility profile $\chi({\bf r})$ of Evans and Stewart is considerably
more sensitive to variations in the strength of local density fluctuations than
the spatial fluctuation profile $F({\bf r})$ and can resolve much more detailed
structure; (ii) while the local compressibility profile is essentially
independent of the choice of spatial discretization used to construct the
profile, the spatial fluctuation profile exhibits strong systematic dependence
on the size of the subvolumes on which the profile is defined. We clarify the
origin and nature of this finite-size effect.

<h3>NMR evidence of spinon localization in kagome antiferromagnet  YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{1-x}$(OH)$_x$]</h3>

<i>Shuo Li, Yi Cui, Zhenyuan Zeng, Yue Wang, Ze Hu, Jie Liu, Cong Li, Xiaoyu Xu, Ying Chen, Zhengxin Liu, Shiliang Li, Weiqiang Yu</i>
<p>We performed nuclear magnetic resonance studies on a kagome antiferromagnet
YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{1-x}$(OH)$_{x}$]. No significant NMR spectral
broadening is found in the Br center peak from 1 K down to 0.05 K, indicating
absence of static antiferromagnetic ordering. In contrast to signatures of
dominant 2D kagome antiferromagnetic fluctuations at temperature above 30 K,
both the Knight shift $K_{\rm{n}}$ and the spin-lattice relaxation rate
$1/T_{1}$ increase when the sample is cooled from 30 K to 8 K, which can be
attributed to the scattering of spin excitations by strong non-magnetic
impurities. Unusually, a hump is observed in $K_{\rm{n}}$ and $1/T_{2}$ close
to 2 K (far below the exchange energy), which indicates the existence of
excitations with a large density of states close to zero energy. These
phenomena are reproduced by a mean-field simulation of Heisenberg model with
bond-dependent exchange interactions, where the sign fluctuations in the spinon
kinetic terms caused by impurities result in localization of spinons and an
almost flat band close to the Fermi energy.

<br>
<i>V. H. Dao, R. Frésard</i>
<p>The functional integral formulation of the Hubbard Model when treated in its
Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation in the radial gauge involves fermionic, as
well as complex and radial slave boson fields. In order to improve on the
understanding of the interplay of the three types of fields, and on the nature
of the latter, we perform a comprehensive investigation of an exactly solvable
two-site cluster, as it entails all pitfalls embodied in this approach. It is
first shown that the exact partition function is recovered, even when
incorporating in the calculation the square root factors that are at the heart
of the representation, when suitably regularized. We show that using radial
slave boson fields allows to overcome all hurdles following from the normal
ordering procedure. We then demonstrate that this applies to the Green's
function too, as well as to the correlation functions of physical interest,
thereby answering the criticisms raised by Sch\"onhammer [K. Sch\"onhammer,
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{42}, 2591 (1990)]. In addition, the investigation
generalizes the calculations to the Hubbard Model extended by a non-local
Coulomb interaction.

<i>Susana Ramos de Debiaggi, Jose Miguel Campillo-Robles, Alejandro Caro</i>
<p>The phase stability of NiAl clusters of nanometer size was studied by using
the embedded atom model and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. For temperatures
of 500 and 1000 K and for a range of compositions below 70 at.% Al, the
equilibrium structures of the system were determined and compared with the bulk
results. We found that the bulk NiAl (B2) and Ni3Al (L12) phases were stable
phases in the nanoparticle system; however, for deviations from ideal
composition, the analysis revealed that, because of the surface effect, the
composition of the clusters was not uniform. There was a core region in which
the structure was ordered, B2 or L12, with a composition very close to the
ideal, and a chemically disordered mantle region that allocated the deviations
from ideal stoichiometries; in this way, a larger phase field appeared,
indicating trends similar to those found in experiments on nanocrystalline NiAl
powder [S.K. Pabi and B.S. Murty, Mater. Sci. Eng. A214, 146 (1996)]. For
concentrations between 37 and 51 at.% Al, an intermediate phase, similar to the
tetragonal L10 martensite, appeared.

<p>Using molecular dynamics simulations, we predict that the inclusion of
nonadiabatic electronic excitations influences the dynamics of preadsorbed
hydrogen abstraction from the W(110) surface by hydrogen scattering. The
hot-atom recombination, which involves hyperthermal diffusion of the impinging
atom on the surface, is significantly affected by the dissipation of energy
mediated by electron-hole pair excitations at low coverage and low incidence
energy. This issue is of importance as this abstraction mechanism is thought to
largely contribute to molecular hydrogen formation from metal surfaces.

<h3>The non-collinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain</h3>

<br>
<i>R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</i>
<p>The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a
frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex
quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three
phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal
spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical
attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties
of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which
exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study
the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational
uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and
correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which
we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find
that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a double-Q structure for the
apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, two peaks merge into a single one
indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible
to external perturbations; they form a large number of gapless magnetic states
that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the
specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive
contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and
a gapless peak at $k=\pi/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small
temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the
$k=\pi/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure. Our results are
relevant, e.g., for the material atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in high magnetic
fields.

<i>Li-Xian Wang, Wouter Beugeling, Fabian Schmitt, Lukas Lunczer, Julian-Benedikt Mayer, Hartmut Buhmann, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz, Laurens W. Molenkamp</i>
<p>The band inversion of topological materials in three spatial dimensions is
intimately connected to the parity anomaly of two-dimensional massless Dirac
fermions. At finite magnetic fields, the parity anomaly reveals itself as a
non-zero spectral asymmetry, i.e., a non-zero difference between the number of
conduction and valence band Landau levels, due to the unpaired zero Landau
level. Here, we realize this two-dimensional Dirac physics at a single surface
of the three-dimensional topological insulator (Hg,Mn)Te. We observe an
unconventional re-entrant quantum Hall effect that can be directly related to
the occurrence of spectral asymmetry in a single topological surface state. The
effect should be observable in any topological insulator where the transport is
dominated by a single Dirac surface state.

<br>
<i>Imam Makhfudz, Mikhail Cherkasskii, Pierre Lombardo, Steffen Schäfer, Silvia Viola Kusminskiy, Roland Hayn</i>
<p>Inspired by the discovery of metal-organic frameworks, the possibility of
quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional kagome systems with
$d$-orbital electrons is studied within a multi-orbital tight-binding model. In
the absence of exchange-type spin-orbit coupling, isotropic Slater-Koster
integrals give a band structure with relativistic (Dirac) and quadratic band
crossing points at high symmetry spots in the Brillouin zone. A quantized
topological invariant requires a flux-creating spin-orbit coupling, giving
Chern number (per spin sector) $C=1$ not only from the familiar Dirac points at
the six corners of the Brillouin zone, but also from the quadratic band
crossing point at the center $\Gamma$. Surprisingly, this QAHE comes from the
nontrivial effective flux induced by the transverse part of the spin-orbit
coupling, exhibited by electrons in the $d$-orbital state with $m_l=0$
($d_{z^2}$ orbital), in stark contrast to the more familiar form of QAHE due to
the $d$-orbitals with $m_l \neq 0$, driven by the Ising part of spin-orbit
coupling. The $C=1$ Chern plateau (per spin sector) due to Dirac point extends
over a smaller region of Fermi energy than that due to quadratic band crossing.
Our result hints at the promising potential of kagome metal-organic frameworks
as a platform for dissipationless electronics by virtue of its unique QAHE.

<p>We report on dynamic Shubnikov - de Haas (SdH) oscillations that are measured
in the optical response, sub - terahertz transmittance of two-dimensional
systems, and reveal two distinct types of oscillation nodes: "universal" nodes
at integer ratios of radiation and cyclotron frequencies and "tunable" nodes at
positions sensitive to all parameters of the structure. The nodes in both real
and imaginary parts of the measured complex transmittance are analyzed using a
dynamic version of the static Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. These results
demonstrate that the node structure of the dynamic SdH oscillations provides an
all-optical access to quantization- and interaction-induced renormalization
effects, in addition to parameters one can obtain from the static SdH
oscillations.

<p>Motivated by the importance of studying topological superconductors beyond
the mean-field approximation, we here investigate mesoscopic islands of time
reversal invariant topological superconductors (TRITOPS). We characterize the
spectrum in the presence of strong order parameter fluctuations in the presence
of an arbitrary number of Kramers pairs of Majorana edge states and study the
effect of coupling the Coulomb blockaded island to external leads. In the case
of an odd fermionic parity on the island, we derive an unconventional Kondo
Hamiltonian in which metallic leads couple to both topological Majorana degrees
of freedom (which keep track of the parity in different leads) and the overall
spin-1/2 in the island. For the simplest case of a single wire (two pairs of
Majorana edge states), we demonstrate that anisotropies are irrelevant in the
weak coupling renormalization group flow. This permits us to solve the Kondo
problem in the vicinity of a Toulouse-like point using Abelian Bosonization. We
demonstrate a residual ground state entropy of $\ln(2)$, which is protected by
spin-rotation symmetry, but reduced to $\ln(\sqrt{2})$ (as in the spinless
topological Kondo effect) by symmetry breaking perturbations. In the symmetric
case, we further demonstrate the simultaneous presence of both Fermi liquid and
non-Fermi liquid like thermodynamics (depending on the observable) and derive
charge and spin transport signatures of the Coulomb blockaded island.
