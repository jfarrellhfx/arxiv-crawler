<h3>Thermal Conductivity and Role of Phonon Scatterings in Suspended Thin  Graphite Nanoribbons</h3>

Thermal conductivity of thin graphitic materials has attracted significant
interests due to their applications in thermal management such as fillers in
polymer composites for thermal interface materials and heat exchangers.
Recently graphite nanoribbons have also been under investigations for
intriguing phonon hydrodynamic transport. However, graphite ribbons with
thickness in the range of hundreds of nanometers have not been measured despite
their importance as both thermal conductivity fillers and as a testbed for
phonon hydrodynamics. In this work, we developed a process to exfoliate
graphite nanoribbons within this thickness range and with length up to 1 mm and
transferred them to a suspended platform to measure their thermal conductivity.
We obtained thermal conductivity around 800 W/m-K at room temperature. With
decreasing temperature, the thermal conductivity initially increased and peaked
at around 150 K, with peak values ranging from 1000 to 1600 W/m-K for ribbon
thickness of 352 to 680 nm. This temperature dependence suggests the strong
phonon Umklapp scattering, which is consistent with the absence of the phonon
hydrodynamics observed in our experiments, as shown by nearly identical thermal
conductivity in two samples with similar thickness (525 and 560 nm) and
different lengths (0.5 and 1 mm). This is contrary to the previous experimental
results suggesting phonon hydrodynamic at room temperature on even thicker
ribbons. Finally, the lower than bulk value of thermal conductivity reveals
strong phonon boundary scattering, suggesting long phonon mean free path, on
the other of 100s nm, in the cross-plane direction of graphite, confirming
certain previous studies.

<h3>Active Ising Models of Flocking: A Field-Theoretic Approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10791" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10791</a>

<br>
<br>
Using an approach based on Doi-Peliti field theory, we study several
different Active Ising Models (AIMs), in each of which collective motion
(flocking) of self-propelled particles arises from the spontaneous breaking of
a discrete symmetry. We test the predictive power of our field theories by
deriving the hydrodynamic equations for the different microscopic choices of
aligning processes that define our various models. At deterministic level, the
resulting equations largely confirm known results, but our approach has the
advantage of allowing systematic generalization to include noise terms. Study
of the resulting hydrodynamics allows us to confirm that the various AIMs share
the same phenomenology of a first order transition from isotropic to flocked
states whenever the self propulsion speed is nonzero, with an important
exception for the case where particles align only pairwise locally. Remarkably,
this variant fails entirely to give flocking -- an outcome that was foreseen in
previous work, but is confirmed here and explained in terms of the scalings of
various terms in the hydrodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss our AIMs in the
limit of zero self-propulsion where the ordering transition is continuous. In
this limit, each model is still out of equilibrium because the dynamical rules
continue to break detailed balance, yet it has been argued that an equilibrium
universality class (Model C) prevails. We study field-theoretically the
connection between our AIMs and Model C, arguing that these particular models
(though not AIMs in general) lie outside the Model C class. We link this to the
fact that in our AIMs without self propulsion, detailed balance is not merely
still broken, but replaced by a different dynamical symmetry in which the
dynamics of the particle density is independent of the spin state.

<h3>Emergence of fluctuating hydrodynamics in chaotic quantum systems</h3>

A fundamental principle of chaotic quantum dynamics is that local subsystems
eventually approach a thermal equilibrium state. Large subsystems thermalize
slower: their approach to equilibrium is limited by the hydrodynamic build-up
of large-scale fluctuations. For classical out-of-equilibrium systems, the
framework of macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) was recently developed to
model the hydrodynamics of fluctuations. We perform large-scale quantum
simulations that monitor the full counting statistics of particle-number
fluctuations in hard-core boson ladders, contrasting systems with ballistic and
chaotic dynamics. We find excellent agreement between our results and MFT
predictions, which allows us to accurately extract diffusion constants from
fluctuation growth. Our results suggest that large-scale fluctuations of
isolated quantum systems display emergent hydrodynamic behavior, expanding the
applicability of MFT to the quantum regime.

Chemical erosion, one of the two major erosion processes along with
mechanical erosion, occurs when a soluble rock like salt, gypsum or limestone
is dissolved in contact with a water flow. The coupling between the geometry of
the rocks, the mass-transfer and the flow leads to the formation of remarkable
patterns, like scallop patterns in caves. We emphasize the common presence of
very sharp shapes and spikes, despite the diversity of hydrodynamic conditions
and the nature of the soluble materials. We explain the generic emergence of
such spikes in dissolution processes by a geometrical approach. Singularities
at the interface emerge as a consequence of the erosion directed in the normal
direction, when the surface displays curvature variations, like those
associated to a dissolution pattern. First, we demonstrate the presence of
singular structures in natural interfaces shaped by dissolution. Then, we
propose simple surface evolution models of increasing complexity demonstrating
the emergence of spikes and allowing us to explain at long term by coarsening
the formation of cellular structures. Finally, we perform a dissolution pattern
experiment driven by solutal convection and we report the emergence of a
cellular pattern following well the model predictions. Although the precise
prediction of dissolution shapes necessitates to perform a complete
hydrodynamic study, we show that the characteristic spikes which are reported
ultimately for dissolution shapes are explained generically by geometrical
arguments due to the surface evolution. These findings can be applied to other
ablation patterns, reported for example in melting ice.

<h3>Hydrodynamic Lubrication in Colloidal Gels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11716" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11716</a>
<br>
<i>Kim William Torre, Joost de Graaf</i>
<br>
<br>
Colloidal gels are elasto-plastic materials composed of an
out-of-equilibrium, self-assembled network of micron-sized (solid) particles
suspended in a fluid. Recent work has shown that far-field hydrodynamic
interactions do not change gel structure, only the rate at which the network
forms and ages. However, during gel formation, the interplay between
short-ranged attractions leading to gelation and equally short-ranged
hydrodynamic lubrication interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we
therefore study gelation using a range of hydrodynamic descriptions: from
single-body (Brownian Dynamics), to pairwise (Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa), to
(non-)lubrication-corrected many-body (Stokesian Dynamics). We confirm the
current understanding informed by simulations accurate in the far-field. Yet,
we find that accounting for lubrication can strongly impact structure at low
colloid volume fraction. Counterintuitively, strongly dissipative lubrication
interactions also accelerate the aging of a gel, irrespective of colloid volume
fraction. Both elements can be explained by lubrication forces facilitating
collective dynamics and therefore phase-separation. Our findings indicate that
despite the computational cost, lubricated hydrodynamic modeling with many-body
far-field interactions is needed to accurately capture the evolution of the gel
structure.

<h3>Disorder effects on the so-called Andreev band in Majorana nanowires</h3>

We comment on a recent publication Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 207001 (2023),
pointing out that the periodic model for the superconducting gap and/or the
spin splitting used by the authors is artificial and does not apply to any real
systems. In addition, we show that the resulting Andreev band introduced by
this artificial and unrealistic periodicity is suppressed by the potential
disorder invariably present in all experimental systems. The results of this
model are therefore contrived and do not apply to any experimental system.

We argue that the chiral $U(1)_A$ symmetry of a Weyl fermion cannot be
implemented by a shallow depth quantum circuit operation in a fermionic lattice
Hamiltonian model with finite dimensional onsite Hilbert spaces. We also extend
this result to discrete ${\mathbb{Z}}_{2N}$ subgroups of $U(1)_A$, in which
case we show that for $N_f$ Weyl fermions of the same helicity, this group
action cannot be implemented with shallow depth circuits when $N_f$ is not an
integer multiple of $2N$.

Moir\'e-pattern based potential engineering has become an important way to
explore exotic physics in a variety of two-dimensional condensed matter
systems. While these potentials have induced correlated phenomena in almost all
commonly studied 2D materials, monolayer graphene has remained an exception. We
demonstrate theoretically that a single layer of graphene, when placed between
two bulk boron nitride crystal substrates with the appropriate twist angles can
support a robust topological ultra-flat band emerging from the second hole
band. This is one of the simplest platforms to design and exploit topological
flat bands.

The electrostatic double layer force is key to determining the stability and
self-assembly of charged colloids and many other soft matter systems. Fully
understanding the attractive force between two like-charged surfaces remains a
great challenge. Here we apply the modified Gaussian renormalized fluctuation
theory to study ion correlation-driven like-charge attraction. The effects of
spatially varying ion correlations on the structure of overlapping double
layers and their free energy are self-consistently accounted for. In the
presence of multivalent counterions, increasing surface charge or ion valency
leads to a short-range attraction. We demonstrate that although both
overcharging and like-charge attraction are outcomes of ion correlation, there
is no causal relationship between them. Our theory also captures the
non-monotonic dependence of like-charge attraction on multivalent salt
concentration. The reduction of attraction at high salt concentrations provides
a possible mechanism for reentrant condensation in charged colloidal
suspensions. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the
observations reported in experiments and simulations.

The sol-gel technique was developed for preparation of silica glasses doped
with europium and copper chalcogenide nanoparticles. A synthesis of copper
compounds proceeded within the solid matrix at the different steps of the
process, and features of final products can be controlled by the precursor
composition and heat treatment conditions. Eu3+-ions within the silica matrix
serves as a luminescent probe sensitive to the environment and a tool for
studies of energy transfer between different absorption and emission centers
with efficient light absorption in nanoparticles and emission by Eu3+.

<h3>Structure and Stability of the Iodide Elpasolite, Cs2AgBiI6</h3>

<br>
<br>
Iodide elpasolites (or double perovskites, A2B'B"I6, B' = M+, B" = M3+) are
predicted to be promising alternatives to lead-based perovskite semiconductors
for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, but no iodide elpasolite has
ever been definitively prepared or structurally characterized. Iodide
elpasolites are widely predicted to be unstable due to favorable decomposition
to the competing A3B2I9 (B = M3+) phase. Here, we report the results of
synchrotron XRD and X-ray total scattering measurements on putative Cs2AgBiI6
nanocrystals made via anion exchange from parent Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals.
Rietveld refinement of XRD and PDF data shows that these nanocrystals indeed
exhibit a tetragonal (I4-m) elpasolite structure, making them the first example
of a structurally characterized iodide elpasolite. A series of experiments
probing structural relaxation and the effects of surface ligation or grain size
all point to the critical role of surface free energy in stabilizing the iodide
elpasolite phase in these nanocrystals.

<h3>Magnetic structure and Kondo lattice behavior in CeVGe$_3$: an NMR and  neutron scattering study</h3>

We present nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), neutron diffraction,
magnetization, and transport measurements on a single crystal and powder of
CeVGe$_3$. This material exhibits heavy fermion behavior at low temperature,
accompanied by antiferromagnetic (AFM) order below 5.8 K. We find that the
magnetic structure is incommensurate with AFM helical structure, characterized
by a magnetic modulated propagation vector of $(0, 0, 0.49)$ with in-plane
moments rotating around the $c$-axis. The NMR Knight shift and spin-lattice
relaxation rate reveal a coherence temperature $T^*\sim 15$ K, and the presence
of significant antiferromagnetic fluctuations reminiscent of the archetypical
heavy fermion compound CeRhIn$_5$. We further identify a metamagnetic
transition above $H_m\sim 2.5$ T for magnetic fields perpendicular to $c$. We
speculate that the magnetic structure in this field-induced phase consists of a
superposition with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic components, which
is consistent with the NMR spectrum in this region of the phase diagram. Our
results thus indicate that CeVGe$_3$ is a hexagonal structure analog to
tetragonal CeRhIn$_5$.

Coulomb integrals, i.e., matrix elements of bare or screened Coulomb
interaction between one-electron orbitals, are fundamental objects in many
approaches developed to tackle the challenging problem of calculating the
electronic structure of strongly correlated materials. In this paper, Coulomb
integrals are analyzed by considering both the point group symmetry of the site
occupied by the atom in the crystal or molecule and the permutation symmetries
of the orbitals in the integrals. In particular, the case where one-electron
orbitals form the basis of a general (i.e. a real, complex or pseudo-complex)
irreducible representation is considered. Explicit formulas are provided to
calculate all integrals of the interaction tensor in terms of a minimum set of
independent ones. The effect of a symmetry breaking is also investigated by
describing Coulomb integrals of a group in terms of those of one of its
subgroups. We develope the specific example of O(3) as the larger group which
can therefore be used to quantify the deviation of a specific system from the
spherical symmetry. Possible applications of the presented framework include
the calculation of solid-state and molecular spectroscopies via multiplet
techniques, dynamical mean-field theory or the GW approximation.

Hybrid ionic-electronic conductors have the potential to generate memory
effects and neuronal behavior. The functionality of these mixed materials
depends on ion motion through thin polarizable channels. Here, we explore
different polarization models to show that the current and conductivity of
electrolytes is higher when confined by conductors than by dielectrics. We show
that the polarization charge location impacts electrolyte structure and
transport properties. This work suggests a mechanism to induce memristor
hysteresis loops using conductor-dielectric switchable materials.

We consider electron--hole Cooper pair condensation in a heterostructure
formed by a topological insulator film and a quantum well. We argue that the
helical nature of the Dirac electronic states at the topological insulator
surface results in the presence of two competing degenerate pairing channels.
The corresponding paired states have an unconventional symmetry in the order
parameter describing the Cooper pair condensate, can be classified by the
topological Chern invariant, and are topologically distinct. We discuss
possible manifestations of the nontrivial topology, including the formation of
chiral states at the domain walls separating two distinct states, quantized
anomalous transport phenomena, and connections with chiral topological
superconductivity.

To investigate the novel quantum dynamic behaviors of magnetic materials that
arise from complex spin-spin interactions, it is necessary to probe the
magnetic response at a speed greater than the spin-relaxation and dephasing
processes. Recently developed two-dimensional (2D) terahertz magnetic resonance
(THz-MR) spectroscopy techniques use the magnetic components of laser pulses,
and this allows investigation of the details of the ultrafast dynamics of spin
systems. For such investigations, quantum treatment -- not only of the spin
system itself but also of the environment surrounding the spin system -- is
important. In our method, based on the theory of multidimensional optical
spectroscopy, we formulate nonlinear THz-MR spectra using an approach based on
the numerically rigorous hierarchical equations of motion. We conduct numerical
calculations of both linear (1D) and 2D THz-MR spectra for a linear chiral spin
chain. The pitch and direction of chirality (clockwise or anticlockwise) are
determined by the strength and sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI). We show that not only the strength but also the sign of the DMI can be
evaluated through the use of 2D THz-MR spectroscopic measurements, while 1D
measurements allow us to determine only the strength.

<h3>Machine learning search for stable binary Sn alloys with Na, Ca, Cu, Pd,  and Ag</h3>

We present our findings of a large-scale screening for new synthesizable
materials in five M-Sn binaries, M = Na, Ca, Cu, Pd, and Ag. The focus on these
systems was motivated by the known richness of M-Sn properties with potential
applications in energy storage, electronics packaging, and superconductivity.
For the systematic exploration of the large configuration space, we relied on
our recently developed MAISE-NET framework that constructs accurate neural
network interatomic potentials and utilizes them to accelerate ab initio global
structure searches. The scan of over two million candidate phases at a fraction
of the typical ab initio calculation cost has uncovered 29 possible
intermetallics thermodynamically stable at different temperatures and pressures
(1 bar and 20 GPa). Notable predictions of ambient-pressure materials include a
simple hP6-NaSn$_2$ phase, fcc-based Pd-rich alloys, tI36-PdSn$_2$ with a new
prototype, and several high-temperature Sn-rich ground states in the Na-Sn,
Cu-Sn, and Ag-Sn systems. Our modeling work also involved ab initio
(re)examination of previously observed M-Sn compounds that helped explain the
entropy-driven stabilization of known Cu-Sn phases. The study demonstrates the
benefits of guiding structure searches with machine learning potentials and
significantly expands the number of predicted thermodynamically stable
crystalline intermetallics achieved with this strategy so far.

<h3>Length-scale Dependence of Stokes-Einstien Breakdown in Active  Glass-forming Liquids</h3>

Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation, which relates diffusion constant with the
viscosity of a liquid at high temperatures in equilibrium, is violated in the
supercooled temperature regime. Whether this relation is obeyed in
nonequilibrium active liquids is a question of significant current interest to
the statistical physics community trying to develop the theoretical framework
of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Via extensive computer simulations of
model active glass-forming liquids in three dimensions, we show that SE is
obeyed at a high temperature similar to the equilibrium behaviour, and it gets
violated in the supercooled temperature regimes. The degree of violation
increases systematically with the increasing activity which quantifies the
amount the system is driven out of equilibrium. First passage-time (FPT)
distributions helped us to gain insights into this enhanced breakdown from the
increased short-time peak, depicting hoppers. Subsequently, we study the wave
vector dependence of SE relation and show that it gets restored at a wave
vector that decreases with increasing activity, and the cross-over wave vector
is found to be proportional to the inverse of the dynamical heterogeneity
length scale in the system. Our work showed how SE violation in active
supercooled liquids could be rationalized using the growth of dynamic length
scale, which is found to grow enormously with increasing activity in these
systems.

AV$_3$Sb$_5$, it contains a kagome lattice comprised only of V ions. Here we
present a comprehensive magnetotransport study on ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. We discovered
several anomalous transport phenomena above the CDW ordering temperature,
including insulating behavior in interlayer resistivity, a strongly
temperature-dependent Hall coefficient, and violation of Kohler's rule. All
these anomalies can be consistently explained by a progressive decrease in
carrier densities with decreasing temperature, suggesting the formation of a
pseudogap. Our findings suggest that high-temperature CDW fluctuations play a
significant role in determining the normal state electronic properties of
ScV$_6$Sn$_6$.

<h3>Exact continuum theory of anti-Klein tunneling in bilayer graphene</h3>

Exact conditions for anti-Klein transmission zeros are found analytically
with a 4-component continuum approach which includes trigonal warping.
Anti-Klein tunneling occurs at oblique incidence on steps and barriers with
soft and hard walls as well as in the known case of normal incidence on a hard
step. The necessary energy and angle of incidence depend on the
crystallographic orientation of the step or barrier. At normal incidence on an
armchair step in unbiased bilayer graphene, anti-Klein tunneling occurs because
both the continuum and the tight binding Hamiltonians are invariant under layer
and site interchange. At oblique incidence, anti-Klein tunneling is
valley-dependent even in the absence of trigonal warping. An experimental
arrangement that functions both as a detector of anti-Klein tunneling and a
valley polarizer is suggested. There are cases where anti-Klein tunneling
occurs in the 4-component theory but not in the 2-component approximation.

<br>
<br>
We investigate, using first-principles methods and effective-model
simulations, the spin-orbit coupling proximity effects in a bilayer
heterostructure comprising phosphorene and WSe$_2$ monolayers. We specifically
analyze holes in phosphorene around the $\Gamma$ point, at which we find a
significant increase of the spin-orbit coupling that can be attributed to the
strong hybridization of phosphorene with the WSe$_2$ bands. We also propose an
effective spin-orbit model based on the ${\bf C}_{1{\rm v}}$ symmetry of the
studied heterostructure. The corresponding spin-orbit field can be divided into
two parts: the in-plane field, present due to the broken nonsymmorphic
horizontal glide mirror plane symmetry, and the dominant out-of-plane field
triggered by breaking the out-of-plane rotational symmetry of the phosphorene
monolayer. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that a heterostructure with
60$^\circ$ twist angle exhibits an opposite out-of-plane spin-orbit field,
indicating that the coupling can effectively be tuned by twisting. The studied
phosphorene/WSe$_2$ bilayer is a prototypical low common-symmetry
heterostructure in which the proximity effect can be used to engineer the spin
texture of the desired material.

<h3>Twist-stretch relations in nucleic acids</h3>

Nucleic acids are highly deformable helical molecules constantly stretched,
twisted and bent in their biological functioning. Single molecule experiments
have shown that double stranded (ds)-RNA and standard ds-DNA have opposite
twist-stretch patterns and stretching properties when overwound under a
constant applied load. The key structural features of the A-form RNA and B-form
DNA helices are here incorporated in a three-dimensional mesoscopic Hamiltonian
model which accounts for the radial, bending and twisting fluctuations of the
base pairs. Using path integral techniques which sum over the ensemble of the
base pair fluctuations, I compute the average helical repeat of the molecules
as a function of the load. The obtained twist-stretch relations and stretching
properties, for short A- and B-helical fragments, are consistent with the
opposite behaviors observed in kilo-base long molecules.

<br>
<br>
Van der Waals heterostructures are an excellent platform for studying
intriguing interface phenomena, such as moir\'e and proximity effects. Surface
science techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have proven a
powerful tool to study such heterostructures but have so far been hampered
because of their high sensitivity to surface contamination. Here, we report a
dry polymer-based assembly technique to fabricate van der Waals
heterostructures with atomically clean surfaces. The key features of our
suspended dry pick-up and flip-over technique are 1) the heterostructure
surface never comes into contact with polymers, 2) it is entirely solvent-free,
3) it is entirely performed in a glovebox, and 4) it only requires temperatures
below 130$^{\circ}$. By performing ambient atomic force microscopy and
atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy on example heterostructures,
we demonstrate that we can fabricate air-sensitive heterostructures with
ultra-clean interfaces and surfaces. Due to the lack of polymer melting, the
technique is further compatible with heterostructure assembly under ultra-high
vacuum conditions, which promises ultimate heterostructure quality.

<h3>Brownian dynamics of Dirac fermions in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

Brownian dynamics of Dirac fermions in twisted bilayer graphene is
investigated within the framework of semiclassical relativistic Langevin
equations. We find that under the influence of orthogonal, commensurate ac
drives in the periodic ratchet potential of a substrate, the charge carriers in
the system exhibit pronounced random dynamics, tuned by the twist angle, making
twisted bilayer graphene distinguishable from monolayer graphene. It is shown
that as threshold twist angle matches the optimal angle, deterministic running
states appear in the limit of weak thermal noise where the diffusion rate is
enhanced significantly compared to bare thermal diffusion. Analysis of the real
space trajectories and diffusion coefficient illustrates the significant role
of thermal noise in the random motion of Dirac fermions. In addition, we find
that the Brownian particle shows remarkable ratchet effect as a net current.

We investigate Bloch oscillations of wave packets in monolayer phosphorene
with broken inversion symmetry. We find that the real space trajectories, Berry
and group velocities of Bloch electron undergo Bloch oscillations in the
system. The strong dependence of Bloch dynamics on the crystal momentum is
illustrated. It is shown that the spin-orbit interaction crucially affects the
dynamics of the Bloch electron. We also demonstrate the dynamics in external
electric and magnetic field within the framework of Newton's equations of
motion, leading to the geometric visualization of such an oscillatory motion.
In the presence of both applied in-plane electric and transverse magnetic
fields, the system undergoes a dynamical transition from confined to
de-confined state and vice versa, tuned by the relative strength of the fields.

Mechanical modulation of the lattice parameter can modify the electronic
structure and manipulate the magnetic coupling of a material without
introducing impurities. Inspired by success in pressure-controlled magnetism,
we investigate the effect of hydrostatic pressure on quantized Chern states in
the antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4, using transport as a
probe. We show that pressure can enhance the robustness of quantum anomalous
Hall (QAH) phases that are otherwise delicate in 7SL MnBi2Te4 and in the
spin-flop (SF) state of 8SL MnBi2Te4. We explain our findings using a coupled
Dirac cone model of MnBi2Te4, which identifies stronger hybridization between
van der Waals layers as the driver of topological states. We further
demonstrate that moderate pressures readily available in laboratory systems can
provide reversible control of magnetic and topological phases. Our results
reveal a strong connection between the mechanical engineering of band topology
and magnetism.

<br>
<br>
Kirigami, a traditional Japanese art of paper-cutting, has recently been
explored for its elastocaloric effect (ECE) in kirigami-based materials (KMs),
where applying strain induces temperature changes. In this study, we
investigate the ECE in a nanoscale graphene kirigami (GK) monolayer,
representing the thinnest possible KM, to better understand this phenomenon.
Through molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the temperature change and
coefficient of performance (COP) of the nanoscale GK architecture. Our findings
reveal that while GKs lack the intricate temperature changes observed in
macroscopic KMs, they exhibit a substantial temperature change of approximately
9.32 K (23 times higher than that of macroscopic KMs, which is about 0.4K) for
heating and -3.50 K for cooling. Additionally, they demonstrate reasonable COP
values of approximately 1.57 and 0.62, respectively. It is noteworthy that the
one-atom-thick graphene configuration prevents the occurrence of the complex
temperature distribution observed in macroscopic KMs.

adverse effect on environment due to the use of toxic and non degradable
materials in various electronic devices. With the emergence of environmental

resistive random access memory (RRAM), write once read many (WORM) unipolar

The electrolyte intercalation mechanism facilitates the insertion/extraction
of charge into the electrode material in rechargeable batteries. Aluminum
fluoride (AlF$_{3}$) has been used as an electrolyte in rechargeable aluminum
batteries with graphite electrodes, demonstrating improved reversibility of
battery charging and discharging processes; however, the intercalation
mechanism of this neutral molecule in graphite is so far unknown. In this work,
we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in ultra-high vacuum conditions,
calculations based on density functional theory, and large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations to reveal the mechanism of AlF$_{3}$ intercalation in
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). We report the formation of AlF$_{3}$
molecules clusters between graphite layers, their self-assembly by graphene
buckling-mediated interactions, and explain the origin and distribution of
superficial {\it blisters} in the material.

Autonomous experimentation (AE) combines machine learning and research
hardware automation in a closed loop, guiding subsequent experiments toward
user goals. As applied to materials research, AE can accelerate materials
exploration, reducing time and cost compared to traditional Edisonian studies.
Additionally, integrating knowledge from diverse sources including theory,
simulations, literature, and domain experts can boost AE performance. Domain
experts may provide unique knowledge addressing tasks that are difficult to
automate. Here, we present a set of methods for integrating human input into an
autonomous materials exploration campaign for composition-structure phase
mapping. The methods are demonstrated on x-ray diffraction data collected from
a thin film ternary combinatorial library. At any point during the campaign,
the user can choose to provide input by indicating regions-of-interest, likely
phase regions, and likely phase boundaries based on their prior knowledge
(e.g., knowledge of the phase map of a similar material system), along with
quantifying their certainty. The human input is integrated by defining a set of
probabilistic priors over the phase map. Algorithm output is a probabilistic
distribution over potential phase maps, given the data, model, and human input.
We demonstrate a significant improvement in phase mapping performance given
appropriate human input.

<h3>Quantum scars and regular eigenstates in a chaotic spinor condensate</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) consist of a few low-entropy eigenstates in an
otherwise chaotic many-body spectrum, and can weakly break ergodicity resulting
in robust oscillatory dynamics. The notion of QMBS follows the original
single-particle scars introduced within the context of quantum billiards, where
scarring manifests in the form of a quantum eigenstate concentrating around an
underlying classical unstable periodic orbit (UPO). A direct connection between
these notions remains an outstanding problem. Here, we study a many-body spinor
condensate that, owing to its collective interactions, is amenable to the
diagnostics of scars. We characterize the system's rich dynamics, spectrum, and
phase space, consisting of both regular and chaotic states. The former are low
in entropy, violate the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and can be
traced back to integrable effective Hamiltonians, whereas most of the latter
are scarred by the underlying semiclassical UPOs, while satisfying ETH. We
outline an experimental proposal to probe our theory in trapped spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensates.

<h3>Superconductivity of Ta-Hf and Ta-Zr alloys: Potential alloys for use in  superconducting devices</h3>

<br>
The electronic properties relevant to the superconductivity are reported for
bulk Ta-Hf and Ta-Zr body centered cubic alloys, in large part to determine
whether their properties are suitable for potential use in superconducting
qbits. The body centered cubic unit cell sizes increase with increasing
alloying. The results of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and
heat capacity characterization are reported. While elemental Ta is a type I
superconductor, the alloys are type II strong coupling superconductors.
Although decreasing the electron count per atom is expected to increase the
density of electronic states at the Fermi level and thus the superconducting
transition temperature (Tc) in these systems, we find that this is not
sufficient to explain the significant increases in the superconducting Tc's
observed.

<br>
<br>
We study the parton construction of chiral spin liquids (CSLs) using
projected Gaussian fermionic entangled pair states (GfPEPSs). First, we show
that GfPEPSs can represent generic spinless Chern insulators faithfully with
finite bond dimensions. Then, by applying the Gutzwiller projection to a
bi-layer GfPEPSs, spin-1/2 Abelian and non-Abelian CSLs are obtained for Chern
number $C=1$ and $C=2$, respectively. As a consequence of the topological
obstruction for GfPEPSs, very weak Gossamer tails are observed in the
correlation functions of the fermionic projected entangled pair state (PEPS)
ansatze, suggesting that the no-go theorem for chiral PEPS is universal but
does not bring any practical limitation. Remarkably, without fine tuning, all
topological sectors can be constructed showing the expected number of chiral
branches in the respective entanglement spectra, providing a sharp improvement
with respect to the known bosonic PEPS approach.

<br>

Li7-4xGexLa3Zr2O12 has been synthesized using the conventional solid-state
reaction method by substituting Germanium (Ge) at the Li site, which increases
the Li-ion vacancies and leads to an increase in conductivity with x varying
from 0.05-0.20. The formation of cubic phase is confirmed by using XRD
analysis. The surface morphology and elemental distribution have been studied
using SEM characterization which gives the average particle size of the sample.
The densities of the samples were calculated. For the confirmation of
functional groups present within the sample, IR spectroscopy has been studied.
The modulus and ac conductivity studies have also been studied. A complex
impedance study has been done in the frequency range 20Hz -20 MHz. Increase in
ionic conductivity by one order has been observed in the sample with x=0.10.
The minimum value of 0.56 eV activation energy is associated with the highest
conductivity value of 7.23 x 10-6 S/cm at room temperature. Thus increment in
ionic conductivity at room temperature makes this material a promising solid
electrolyte for future sustainable energy storage devices.

We study the effect of spatially-varying potential and diffusivity on the
dispersion of a tracer particle in single-file diffusion. Non-interacting
particles in such a system exhibit normal diffusion at late times, which is
characterised by an effective diffusion constant $D_\mathrm{eff}$. Here we
demonstrate the physically appealing result that the dispersion of single-file
tracers in this system has the same long-time behavior as that for Brownian
particles in a spatially-homogeneous system with constant diffusivity
$D_\mathrm{eff}$. Our results are based on a late-time analysis of the
Fokker-Planck equation, motivated by the mathematical theory of homogenization.
The findings are confirmed by numerical simulations for both annealed and
quenched initial conditions.

Charge ordering (CO) phenomena have been widely debated in
strongly-correlated electron systems mainly regarding their role in
high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we elucidate the structural and
charge distribution in NdNiO$_{2}$ thin films prepared with and without capping
layers, and characterized by the absence and presence of CO. Our
microstructural and spectroscopic analysis was done by scanning transmission
electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) and hard
x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). Capped samples show Ni$^{1+}$, with
an out-of-plane (o-o-p) lattice parameter of around 3.30 angstroms indicating
good stabilization of the infinite-layer structure. Bulk-sensitive HAXPES on
Ni-2p shows weak satellite feature indicating large charge-transfer energy. The
uncapped samples evidence an increase of the o-o-p parameter up to 3.65
angstroms on the thin-film top, and spectroscopies show signatures of higher
valence in this region (towards Ni$^{2+}$). Here, 4D-STEM demonstrates (3,0,3)
oriented stripes which emerge from partially occupied apical oxygen. Those
stripes form quasi-2D coherent domains viewed as rods in the reciprocal space
with $\Delta\text{q}_{z} \approx 0.24$ r.l.u. extension located at Q = ($\pm
\frac{1}{3},0,\pm \frac{1}{3}$) r.l.u. and Q = ($\pm \frac{2}{3},0,\pm
\frac{2}{3}$) r.l.u. The stripes associated with oxygen re-intercalation
concomitant with hole doping suggests a possible link to the previously
reported CO in infinite-layer nickelate thin films.

Understanding the structural evolution of granular systems is a long-standing
problem. A recently proposed theory for such dynamics in two dimensions
predicts that steady states of very dense systems satisfy detailed-balance. We
analyse analytically and numerically the steady states of this theory in
systems of arbitrary density and report the following. 1. We discover that all
such dynamics almost certainly possess only one physical steady state, which
may or may not satisfy detailed balance. 2. We show rigorously that, if a
detailed balance solution is possible then it is unique. The above two results
correct an erroneous conjecture in the literature. 3. We show rigorously that
the detailed-balance solutions in very dense systems are globally stable,
extending the local stability found for these solutions in the literature. 4.
In view of recent experimental observations of robust detailed balance steady
states in very dilute cyclically sheared systems, our results point to a
self-organisation of process rates in dynamic granular systems.

Simultaneous manipulation of charge and spin density distributions in
materials is the key element required in spintronics applications. Here we
study the formation of coupled spin and charge densities arising in scattering
of electrons by domains of local magnetization producing a position-dependent
Zeeman field in the presence of the spin-momentum locking typical for
topological insulators. Analytically and numerically calculated scattering
pattern is determined by the electron energy, domain magnetization, and size.
The spin-momentum locking produces strong differences with respect to the
spin-diagonal scattering and leads to the scattering asymmetry with nonzero
mean scattering angle as determined by only two parameters characterizing the
system. To extend the variety of possible patterns, we study scattering by
diffraction gratings and propose to design them in modern nanostructures based
on topological insulators to produce desired distributions of the charge and
spin densities. These results can be useful for engineering of magnetic
patterns for electron optics to control coupled charge and spin evolution.

Local measurements of heat flux in Quantum Hall devices can deviate from the
expected equilibrium heat flux due to interactions. We present a model of a
simple mesoscopic device consisting of an Ohmic reservoir contacted by chiral
edge states. In contrast to the well studied heat Coulomb blockade (HCB)
effect, we report the opposite phenomenon, an enhancement of the heat flux
carried by an edge state in the HCB regime due to an additional contribution of
the collective charge mode via the fluctuating potential of the Ohmic contact.
We discuss the thermometry of these correlared states and discuss their
detectability. The enhancement effect is also reflected in modified correlation
functions, which influences the electrical and thermal linear response
coefficients in a tunneling probe measurement. On a technical level, we
introduce a Langevin formalism that elucidates the role of these extra
fluctuations in electrical and thermal transport, both in uniformly heated and
Joule heated devices and argue that our approach has advantages in the latter
scenario compared to the standard $P (E)$ theory. We report a violation of the
Wiedemann-Franz law, which is modified by the external resistance of the
mesoscopic circuit.

<h3>Granular solids transmit stress as two-phase composites</h3>

A basic problem in the science of realistic granular matter is the plethora
of heuristic models of the stress field in the absence of a first-principles
theory. Such a theory is formulated here, based on the idea that static
granular assemblies can be regarded as two-phase composites. A thought
experiment is described, demonstrating that the state of such materials can be
varied continuously from marginal stability, via a two-phase granular assembly,
then porous structure, and finally be made perfectly elastic. This process is
accompanied by the shortening of a response length, which diverges at the
marginally stable state. For completeness, I review briefly the condition for
marginal stability in infinitely large assemblies and point out important
corrections to the values of its mean coordination number, which are standardly
neglected in the literature. The general solution for the stress equations in
$d=2$ are reviewed in detail and shown to be consistent with the two-phase
idea. A method for identifying the phases of finite regions in larger systems
is constructed, providing a stability parameter that quantifies the `proximity'
to the marginally stable state. The difficulty involved in deriving stress
fields in such composites is a unique constraint on the boundary between phases
and, to highlight it, a simple case of a stack of plates of alternating phase
is solved explicitly. An effective medium approximation, which satisfies this
constraint, is then developed and analysed in detail. This paper forms a basis
for the extension of the stress theory to general granular solids that are not
marginally stable or at the yield threshold.

Impurities or boundaries often impose nontrivial boundary conditions on a
gapless bulk, resulting in distinct boundary universality classes for a given
bulk, phase transitions, and non-Fermi liquids in diverse systems. The
underlying boundary states however remain largely unexplored. This is related
with a fundamental issue how a Kondo cloud spatially forms to screen a magnetic
impurity in a metal. Here we predict the quantum-coherent spatial and energy
structure of multichannel Kondo clouds, representative boundary states
involving competing non-Fermi liquids, by studying quantum entanglement between
the impurity and the channels. Entanglement shells of distinct non-Fermi
liquids coexist in the structure, depending on the channels. As temperature
increases, the shells become suppressed one by one from the outside, and the
remaining outermost shell determines the thermal phase of each channel.
Detection of the entanglement shells is experimentally feasible. Our findings
suggest a guide to studying other boundary states and boundary-bulk
entanglement.

Analog quantum optimization methods, such as quantum annealing, are promising

sampling problems with quantum hardware. However, they have thus far failed to
demonstrate broadly applicable quantum speedups, and an important contributing
factor to this is slowdowns from embedding, the process of mapping logical
variables to long chains of physical qubits, enabling arbitrary connectivity on
the short-ranged 2d hardware grid. Beyond the spatial overhead in qubit count,
embedding can lead to severe time overhead, arising from processes where
individual chains ``freeze" into ferromagnetic states at different times during
evolution, and once frozen the tunneling rate of this single logical variable
decays exponentially in chain length. We show that this effect can be
substantially mitigated by local AC variation of the qubit parameters as in the
RFQA protocol (Kapit and Oganesyan, Quant. Sci. Tech. \textbf{6}, 025013
(2021)), through a mechanism we call Symphonic Tunneling. We provide general
arguments and substantial numerical evidence to show that AC-driven multi-qubit
tunneling is dramatically faster than its DC counterpart, and since ST is not a
1d-specific mechanism, this enhancement should extend to clusters of coupled
chains as well. And unlike a uniform transverse field, in higher dimensions
this method cannot be efficiently simulated classically. We explore schemes to
synchronize the AC tones within chains to further improve performance.
Implemented at scale, these methods could significantly improve the prospects
for achieving quantum scaling advantages in near-term hardware.

<i>Qian Jia, Jintao Xu, Haibo Qiu, Antonio Muñoz Mateo</i>
<br>
<br>
We show how the chiral properties of Bose Einstein condensates subject to
current-density interactions and loaded in optical lattices can be observed in
the realization of nonlinear Bloch states, whose spectrum lacks the usual
periodic structure. Chirality is also manifested by spatially localized states,
or gap solitons, which are found for positive rotation rates of the lattice at
the energy gaps between the linear energy bands, whereas for negative rotations
they appear in the semi-infinite gap of the linear spectrum. The stability of
extended and localized states is checked through the spectrum of linear
excitations and nonlinear time evolution of perturbed states, and the
phenomenon of Bloch oscillations is explored. Our results are obtained in quasi
1D ring geometries with feasible experimental parameters.

The non-equilibrium energy exchange mechanism between electronic and lattice
degrees of freedom is of central importance for understanding ultrafast
phenomena such as manipulating magnetism on the femtosecond timescale. We show
for ferromagnetic Ni, where ultrafast demagnetization was first discovered, how
scattering processes between transient phonons and valence electrons take place
in real time. The observed momentum-dependent filling of electronic states
provides a new avenue to understand and ultimately tailor materials properties
far from equilibrium.

<i>Eduardo Ibarra-García-Padilla, Chunhan Feng, Giulio Pasqualetti, Simon Fölling, Richard T. Scalettar, Ehsan Khatami, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the SU(3) symmetric Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) in the square lattice
at $1/3$-filling using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
and numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE) techniques. We present the
$T$-$U$ phase diagram of the model, in which we observe signatures of the
metal-insulator transition and magnetic crossovers. These signatures are the
temperature scale characterizing the rise of the compressibility, and an
interaction-dependent change in the sign of the diagonal spin-spin correlation
function. The analysis of the compressibility estimates the location of the
metal-insulator quantum critical point at $U_c/t \sim 6$, and provides a
temperature scale for observing Mott physics at finite-$T$. Furthermore, from
the analysis of the spin-spin correlation function we observe that for $U/t
\gtrsim6$ and $T \sim J = 4t^2/U$ there is a development of a short-ranged two
sublattice (2-SL) antiferromagnetic structure, as well as an emerging three
sublattice (3-SL) antiferromagnetic structure as the temperature is lowered
below $T/J \lesssim 0.57$. This crossover from 2-SL to 3-SL magnetic ordering
agrees with Heisenberg limit predictions, and has observable effects on the
number of on-site pairs. Finally, we describe how the features of the $T$-$U$
phase diagram can be explored with alkaline-earth-like atoms in optical
lattices with currently-achieved experimental techniques and temperatures. The
results discussed in this manuscript provide a starting point for the
exploration of the SU(3) FHM upon doping.

The orbital Hall effect has been theoretically predicted but its direct
observation is a challenge. Here, we report the magneto-optical detection of
current-induced orbital accumulation at the surface of a light 3$d$ transition
metal, Cr. The orbital polarization is in-plane, transverse to the current
direction, and scales linearly with current density, consistent with the
orbital Hall effect. Comparing the thickness-dependent magneto-optical
measurements with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations, we estimate an orbital
diffusion length in Cr of $6.6\pm 0.6$ nm.

The strong long-range interaction leads to localization in the closed quantum
system without disorders. Employing the exact diagonalization method, the
author numerically investigates thermalization and many-body localization in
translational invariant quantum chains with finite Coulomb interactions. In the
computational basis, excluding all trivial degeneracies, the
interaction-induced localization is well demonstrated in aspects of level
statistics, eigenstate expectation values, and the Anderson localization on
graphs constructed of the many-body basis. The nature of localization for
generic eigenstates is attributed to the quasi-disorder from the power-law
interactions. However, due to the real-space symmetries, the long-time dynamics
is dominated by the degenerate eigenstates and eventually reach homogeneity in
real space. On the other hand, the entanglement entropy exhibits the
size-dependence beyond the area law for the same reason, even deep in the
localized state, indicating an incomplete localization in real space.

<h3>Tunneling valley Hall effect driven by tilted Dirac fermions</h3>

Valleytronics is a research field utilizing a valley degree of freedom of
electrons for information processing and storage. A strong valley polarization
is critical for realistic valleytronic applications. Here, we predict a
tunneling valley Hall effect (TVHE) driven by tilted Dirac fermions in
all-in-one tunnel junctions based on a two-dimensional (2D) valley material.
Different doping of the electrode and spacer regions in these tunnel junctions
results in momentum filtering of the tunneling Dirac fermions, generating a
strong transverse valley Hall current dependent on the Dirac-cone tilting.
Using the parameters of an existing 2D valley material, we demonstrate that
such a TVHE is much stronger than that induced by the intrinsic Berry curvature
mechanism reported previously. Finally, we predict that resonant tunneling can
occur in a tunnel junction with properly engineered device parameters such as
the spacer width and transport direction, providing significant enhancement of
the valley Hall angle. Our work opens a new approach to generate valley
polarization in realistic valleytronic systems.

<h3>On the Active Components in Crystalline Li-Nb-O and Li-Ta-O Coatings  from First Principles</h3>

Layered-oxide $\mathrm{LiNi_xMn_yCo_{1-x-y}O_2}$ (NMC) positive electrodes
with high Nickel content, deliver high voltages and energy densities. However,
a high nickel content, e.g., $x$ = 0.8 (NMC 811), can lead to high surface
reactivity, which can trigger thermal runaway and gas generation. While claimed
safer, all-solid-state batteries still suffer from high interfacial resistance.
Here, we investigate niobate and tantalate coating materials, which can
mitigate the interfacial reactivities in Li-ion and all-solid-state batteries.
First-principles calculations reveal the multiphasic nature of Li-Nb-O and
Li-Ta-O coatings, containing mixtures of $\mathrm{LiNbO_3}$ and
$\mathrm{Li_3NbO_4}$, or of $\mathrm{LiTaO_3}$ and $\mathrm{Li_3TaO_4}$. The
concurrence of several phases in Li-Nb-O or Li-Ta-O modulates the type of
stable native defects in these coatings. Li-Nb-O and Li-Ta-O coating materials
can form favorably lithium vacancies $\mathrm{Vac^{'}_{Li}}$ and antisite
defects $\mathrm{Nb^{\bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet}_{Li}}$
($\mathrm{Ta^{\bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet}_{Li}}$) combined into
charge-neutral defect complexes. Even in defective crystalline
$\mathrm{LiNbO_3}$ (or $\mathrm{LiTaO_3}$), we reveal poor Li-ion conduction
properties. In contrast, $\mathrm{Li_3NbO_4}$ and $\mathrm{Li_3TaO_4}$ that are
introduced by high-temperature calcinations can provide adequate Li-ion
transport in these coatings. Our in-depth investigation of the
structure-property relationships in the important Li-Nb-O and Li-Ta-O coating
materials helps to develop more suitable calcination protocols to maximize the
functional properties of these niobates and tantalates.

<h3>On the Theory of Difference Frequency Quantum Oscillations</h3>

Quantum oscillations (QO) describe the periodic variation of physical
observables as a function of inverse magnetic field in metals. The Onsager
relation connects the basic QO frequencies with the extremal areas of closed
Fermi surface pockets, and the theory of magnetic breakdown explains the
observation of sums of QO frequencies at high magnetic fields. Here we develop
a quantitative theory of {\it difference frequency} QOs in two- and
three-dimensional metals with multiple Fermi pockets with parabolic or linearly
dispersing excitations. We show that a non-linear interband coupling, e.g. in
the form of interband impurity scattering, can give rise to otherwise forbidden
QO frequencies which can persist to much higher temperatures compared to the
basis frequencies. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings for
various material candidates, for example multi-fold fermion systems, and the
relation to magneto intersubband oscillations known for coupled two-dimensional
electron gases.

<h3>Nonsteady dynamics at the dynamic depinning transition in the  two-dimensional Gaussian random-field Ising model</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaohui Qian, Gaotian Yu, Nengji Zhou</i>
<br>
<br>
With large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the nonsteady
relaxation at the dynamic depinning transition in the two-dimensional Gaussian
random-field Ising model. The dynamic scaling behavior is carefully analyzed,
and the transition fields as well as static and dynamic exponents are
accurately determined based on the short-time dynamic scaling form. Different
from the usual assumption, two distinguished growth processes of spatial
correlation lengths for the velocity and height of the domain wall are found.
Thus, the universality class of the depinning transition is established, which
significantly differs from that of the quenched disorder equation but agrees
with that of the recent experiment as well as other simulations works. Under
the influence of the mesoscopic time regime, the crossover from the
second-order phase transition to the first-order one is confirmed in the
weak-disorder regime, yielding an abnormal disorder-dependent nature of the
criticality.

Materials discovery, especially for applications that require extreme
operating conditions, requires extensive testing that naturally limits the
ability to inquire the wealth of possible compositions. Machine Learning (ML)
has nowadays a well established role in facilitating this effort in systematic
ways. The increasing amount of available accurate DFT data represents a solid
basis upon which new ML models can be trained and tested. While conventional
models rely on static descriptors, generally suitable for a limited class of
systems, the flexibility of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) allows for direct
learning representations on graphs, such as the ones formed by crystals. We
utilize crystal graph neural networks (CGNN) to predict crystal properties with
DFT level accuracy, through graphs with encoding of the atomic (node/vertex),
bond (edge), and global state attributes. In this work, we aim at testing the
ability of the CGNN MegNet framework in predicting a number of properties of
systems previously unseen from the model, obtained by adding a substitutional
defect in bulk crystals that are included in the training set. We perform DFT
validation to assess the accuracy in the prediction of formation energies and
structural features (such as elastic moduli). Using CGNNs, one may identify
promising paths in alloy discovery.

The adaptive and surprising emergent properties of biological materials
self-assembled in far-from-equilibrium environments serve as an inspiration for
efforts to design nanomaterials and their properties. In particular,
controlling the conditions of self-assembly can modulate material properties,
but there is no systematic understanding of either how to parameterize this
control or how \emph{controllable} a given material can be. Here, we
demonstrate that branched actin networks can be encoded with
\textit{metamaterial} properties by dynamically controlling the applied force
under which they grow, and that the protocols can be selected using multi-task
reinforcement learning. These actin networks have tunable responses over a
large dynamic range depending on the chosen external protocol, providing a
pathway to encoding ``memory'' within these structures. Interestingly, we show
that encoding memory requires dissipation and the rate of encoding is
constrained by the flow of entropy -- both physical and information
theoretical. Taken together, these results emphasize the utility and necessity
of nonequilibrium control for designing self-assembled nanostructures.

Curved liquid films pervade a range of natural systems across scales, from
planetary atmospheres to lipid vesicles, making them the norm rather than the
exception. However, while the influence of curvature on the ordered states of
condensed matter has been extensively studied, its impact on fluid flows
remains mostly limited to the exploration of simple geometries such as spheres
and cylinders. Here, combining microfluidic experiments and theory, we
elucidate how curvature heterogeneities shape confined viscous flows. We show
that isotropic bumps induce local distortions to Darcy's flows whereas
anisotropic curvature heterogeneities disturb them algebraically over
system-spanning scales. By employing an electrostatic analogy, we gain insight
into this singular geometric perturbation, and quantitatively explain it using
both conformal mapping and numerical simulations. Altogether our findings
establish the robustness of our experimental observations and explain more
broadly how curvature shape two-dimensional potential flows in systems as
diverse as porous media, soap bubbles and superfluid films.

The Stone-Wales defect is a well-known and significant defective structure in
carbon materials, impacting their mechanical, chemical, and electronic
properties. Recently, a novel metal-carbon nanomaterial named Volleyballene has
been discovered, characterized by a C-C bond bridging two carbon pentagons.
Using first-principles calculations, a stable Stone-Wales-defective counterpart
of Volleyballene, exhibiting $T_h$ symmetry, has been proposed by rotating the
C-C bond by 90${\deg}$. Although its binding energy per atom is slightly higher
than Volleyballene (${\Delta}E_b$ = 0.009 eV/atom), implying marginally lower
structural stability, it can maintain its bond structure until the effective
temperature reaches about 1538.56 K, indicating greater thermodynamic
stability. Additionally, its highest vibration frequency is 1346.2 cm$^{-1}$,
indicating strong chemical bond strength. A theoretical analysis of the
Sc$_{20}$C$_{60}$+Sc$_{20}$C$_{60}$ binary systems highlights that the stable
building block may be applied in potential nano-assembly.

The optical response of doped monolayer semiconductors is governed by trions,
i.e. photoexcited electron-hole pairs bound to doping charges. While their
photoluminescence (PL) signatures have been identified in experiments, a
microscopic model consistently capturing bright and dark trion peaks is still
lacking. In this work, we derive a generalized trion PL formula on a
quantum-mechanical footing, considering direct and phonon-assisted
recombination mechanisms. We show the trion energy landscape in WSe$_2$ by
solving the trion Schr\"odinger equation. We reveal that the mass imbalance
between equal charges results in less stable trions exhibiting a small binding
energy and, interestingly, a large energetic offset from exciton peaks in PL
spectra. Furthermore, we compute the temperature-dependent PL spectra for n-
and p-doped monolayers and predict yet unobserved signatures originating from
trions with an electron at the $\Lambda$ point. Our work presents an important
step towards a microscopic understanding of the internal structure of trions
determining their stability and optical fingerprint.

<h3>Spontaneous Exciton Dissociation in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide  Monolayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Since the seminal work on MoS2 monolayers, photoexcitation in atomically-thin
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been assumed to result in excitons
with large binding energies (~ 200-600 meV). Because the exciton binding
energies are order-of-magnitude larger than thermal energy at room temperature,
it is puzzling that photocurrent and photovoltage generation have been observed
in TMDC-based devices, even in monolayers with applied electric fields far
below the threshold for exciton dissociation. Here, we show that the
photoexcitation of TMDC monolayers results in a substantial population of free
charges. Performing ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy on large-area,
single crystal WS2, WSe2, and MoSe2 monolayers, we find that ~10% of excitons
spontaneously dissociate into charge carriers with lifetimes exceeding 0.2 ns.
Scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals that photo-carrier generation is
intimately related to mid-gap defect states, likely via trap-mediated Auger
scattering. Only in state-of-the-art quality monolayers14, with mid-gap trap
densities as low as 10^9 cm^-2, does intrinsic exciton physics start to
dominate the THz response. Our findings reveal that excitons or excitonic
complexes are only the predominant quasiparticles in photo-excited TMDC
monolayers at the limit of sufficiently low defect densities.

<br>
<br>
The mobility edge (ME) is a crucial concept in understanding localization
physics, marking the critical transition between extended and localized states
in the energy spectrum. Anderson localization scaling theory predicts the
absence of ME in lower dimensional systems. Hence, the search for exact MEs,
particularly for single particles in lower dimensions, has recently garnered
significant interest in both theoretical and experimental studies, resulting in
notable progress. However, several open questions remain, including the
possibility of a single system exhibiting multiple MEs and the continual
existence of extended states, even within the strong disorder domain. Here, we
provide experimental evidence to address these questions by utilizing a
quasiperiodic mosaic lattice with meticulously designed nanophotonic circuits.
Our observations demonstrate the coexistence of extended and localized states
in lattices with broken duality symmetry and varying modulation periods. By
single site injection and scanning the disorder level, we could approximately
probe the ME of the modulated lattice. These results corroborate recent
theoretical predictions, introduce a new avenue for investigating ME physics,
and offer inspiration for further exploration of ME physics in the quantum
regime using hybrid integrated photonic devices.

<br>
<br>
Quantum transport and localization are fundamental concepts in condensed
matter physics. It is commonly believed that in one-dimensional systems, the
existence of mobility edges is highly dependent on disorder. Recent theoretical
works have shown that a modulated mosaic model could manifest an exact mobility
edge even without quenched disorder. Here, we experimentally implement such
disorder-free mosaic photonic lattices using silicon photonics platform. By
creating a synthetic electric field, we could observe energy-dependent
coexistence of both extended and localized states in the system. The
Wannier-Stark ladder emerges when the resulting potential is strong enough, and
can be directly probed by exciting different spatial modes of the lattice. Our
studies bridge the gap between mobility edge and Wannier-Stark localization.
Our developed photonic devices hold the potential to encode high dimensional
quantum resources with compact and robust structures

<br>
A multiscale approach based on molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte
Carlo (kMC) methods is developed to simulate the dynamics of an $\langle
\mathbf{a} \rangle$ screw dislocation in $\alpha$-Ti. The free energy barriers
for the core dissociation transitions and Peierls barriers for dislocation
glide as a function of temperature are extracted from the MD simulations (based
on Machine Learning interatomic potentials and optimization); these form the
input to kMC simulations. Random walk dislocation trajectories from kMC agree
well with those predicted by MD. On some planes, dislocations move via a
locking-unlocking mechanism. Surprisingly, some dislocations glide in
directions that are not parallel with the core dissociation direction. The
MD/kMC multiscale method proposed is applicable to dislocation motion in simple
and complex materials (not only screw dislocations in Ti) as a function of
temperature and stress state.

We study a chemically active binary mixture undergoing phase separation and
show that under non-equilibrium conditions, stable liquid spherical shells can
form via a spinodal instability in the droplet center. A single liquid shell
tends to grow until it undergoes a shape instability beyond a critical size. In
an active emulsion, many stable and stationary liquid shells can coexist. We
discuss conditions under which liquid shells are stable and dominant as
compared to regimes where droplets undergo shape instabilities and divide.

We present a model, based on symmetry and geometry, for proteins. Using
elementary ideas from mathematics and physics, we derive the geometries of
discrete helices and sheets. We postulate a compatible solvent-mediated
emergent pairwise attraction that assembles these building blocks, while
respecting their individual symmetries. Instead of seeking to mimic the
complexity of proteins, we look for a simple abstraction of reality that yet
captures the essence of proteins. We employ analytic calculations and detailed
Monte Carlo simulations to explore some consequences of our theory. The
predictions of our approach are in accord with experimental data. Our framework
provides a rationalization for understanding the common characteristics of
proteins. Our results show that the free energy landscape of a globular protein
is pre-sculpted at the backbone level, sequences and functionalities evolve in
the fixed backdrop of the folds determined by geometry and symmetry, and that
protein structures are unique in being simultaneously characterized by
stability, diversity, and sensitivity.

We deal here with three metastable systems: 1{\textdegree}- the dowser
texture, 2{\textdegree}- supertwistedcholesterics and 3{\textdegree}-
hypotwisted cholesterics. We outline remarkable properties of tropisms of the
dowser texture stemming from its low symmetry and we show that, using setups
called Dowsons Colliders, nematic monopoles can be nucleated, set into motion
and brought into collisions in the dowser texture. Subsequently we point out
that nucleation of dislocation loops occurs in cholesteric layers compressed or
dilated between cylindrical mica sheets. Under compression, three modes of
nucleation of dislocation loops have been identified: individual, serial and
continuous. The serial mode generates dislocation nets made of L circular loops
connected by C radial crossing into superloops. Similar superloops can also be
generated under dilation. We analyse the topology of superloops in terms of the
theory of knots and point out they can be reduced into the unknot by
Reidemeister moves. In other words, superloops are multiply folded loops that
can be continuously unfolded.

We report on atomic-scale analyses of nucleation and growth of Zr oxide
precipitates and the microstructural evolution of internally oxidized Nb3Sn
wires for high-field superconducting magnet applications, utilizing atom probe
tomography (APT), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and first-principles
calculations. APT analyses reveal that prior to interfacial reactions at
Nb/Nb3Sn interfaces, Zr atoms in an unreacted Nb-1Zr-4Ta (at.%) alloy form
clusters with O atoms owing to their high affinity for oxygen and are
segregated at grain boundaries (GBs) in the Nb grains. Then, nucleation of Zr
oxide precipitates occurs in Nb3Sn and at Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces, driven by the
small solubility of Zr and O in Nb3Sn compared to Nb. Quantitative APT and TEM
analyses of Zr oxide precipitates in Nb3Sn layers demonstrate the nucleation,
growth, and coarsening processes of Zr oxide precipitates in Nb3Sn layers. A
high number density of Zr oxide nanoprecipitates is observed in the Nb3Sn
layers, ~10^23 per m^3, with a mean precipitate diam. <10 nm at 625 oC and 700
oC, which provide pinning centers for grain refinement of Nb3Sn, <100 nm diam.,
and serve as pinning sites for fluxons. First-principles calculations and
classical nucleation theory are employed to describe the nucleation of Zr oxide
precipitates in Nb3Sn: energy barriers and the critical radius for nucleation
of Zr oxide precipitates in Nb3Sn. Our research yields the kinetic pathways for
nucleation and growth of Zr oxide precipitates and the microstructural
evolution of Nb3Sn layers, which helps to improve the fabrication process of
internally oxidized Nb3Sn wires for high-field superconducting magnets.

<br>
<br>
Recently, we presented a framework for understanding protein structure based
on the idea that simple constructs of holding hands or touching of objects can
be used to rationalize the common characteristics of globular proteins. We
developed a consistent approach for understanding the formation of the two key
common building blocks of helices and sheets as well as the compatible assembly
of secondary structures into the tertiary structure through the notion of
poking pairwise interactions. Here we benchmark our predictions with a detailed
analysis of structural data of over 4000 proteins from the Protein Data Bank.
We also present the results of detailed computer simulations of a simplified
model demonstrating a pre-sculpted free energy landscape, determined by
geometry and symmetry, comprising numerous minima corresponding to putative
native state structures. We explore the consequences of our model. Our results
suggest that symmetry and geometry are a powerful guide to capture the
simplicity underlying protein complexity.

<br>
<br>
Dopant-free lateral p-n junctions in the GaAs/AlGaAs material system have
attracted interest due to their potential use in quantum optoelectronics (e.g.,
optical quantum computers or quantum repeaters) and ease of integration with
other components, such as single electron pumps and spin qubits. A major
obstacle to integration has been unwanted charge accumulation at the p-n
junction gap that suppresses light emission, either due to enhanced
non-radiative recombination or inhibition of p-n current. Typically, samples
must frequently be warmed to room temperature to dissipate this built-up charge
and restore light emission in a subsequent cooldown. Here, we introduce a
practical gate voltage protocol that clears this parasitic charge accumulation,
in-situ at low temperature, enabling the indefinite cryogenic operation of
devices. This reset protocol enabled the optical characterization of stable,
bright, dopant-free lateral p-n junctions with electroluminescence linewidths
among the narrowest (< 1 meV; < 0.5 nm) reported in this type of device. It
also enabled the unambiguous identification of the ground state of neutral free
excitons (heavy and light holes), as well as charged excitons (trions). The
free exciton emission energies for both photoluminescence and
electroluminescence are found to be nearly identical. The binding and
dissociation energies for free and charged excitons are reported. A free
exciton lifetime of 237 ps was measured by time-resolved electroluminescence,
compared to 419 ps with time-resolved photoluminescence.

We investigate a simplified continuum model of a twisted homotrilayer TMD
with negligible next-nearest layer couplings. We systematically analyze band
structure and topology of various stacking configurations in a twist angle
range from $1^\circ$ to $4^\circ$. This allows us to uncover a plethora of
topological transitions as well as various angle regimes with flat bands - some
of them topologically non-trivial, which are of growing interest for the
realization of exotic strongly correlated phases. Additionally, we uncover
surprising properties, such as that for certain stacking configurations, some
layers effectively decouple from other layers. In this case, the only remnant
of coupling between layers is a layer-dependent energy shift.

<br>
<br>
Here we present a detailed investigation of the Co and Ir local electronic
structures in La1.5A0.5CoIrO6 (A = Ba, Ca) compounds in order to unravel the
orbital hybridization mechanism in these CoIr-based double perovskites. Our
results of x-ray powder diffraction, ac and dc magnetization, Co and Ir
L2,3-edges and Co K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism suggest a competition between magnetic interactions. A
dominant antiferromagnetic coupling is found to be responsible for the
ferrimagnetic behavior observed for A = Ca below approximately 96 K, the
competing magnetic phases and the cationic disorder in this compound giving
rise to a spin-glass state at low temperatures. For the A = Ba, on the other
hand, there is no evidence of long range order down to its spin-glass
transition temperature. The remarkably different magnetic properties observed
between these two compounds is discussed in terms of the structural distortion
that alters the strength of the Co - Ir couplings, with a relevant role played
by the Co 3d eg - Ir 5d j = 1/2 hybridization.

<br>
<br>
Strong coupling between lead halide perovskite materials and optical
resonators enables both the polaritonic control of the photophysical properties
of these emerging semiconductors and the observation of novel fundamental
physical phenomena. However, the difficulty to achieve optical-quality
perovskite quantum dot (PQD) films showing well-defined excitonic transitions
has prevented the study of strong light-matter coupling in these materials,
central to the field of optoelectronics. Herein we demonstrate the formation at
room temperature of multiple cavity exciton-polaritons in metallic resonators
embedding highly transparent Cesium Lead Bromide quantum dot (CsPbBr3-QD)
solids, revealed by a significant reconfiguration of the absorption and
emission properties of the system. Our results indicate that the effects of
biexciton interaction or large polaron formation, frequently invoked to explain
the properties of PQDs, are seemingly absent or compensated by other more
conspicuous effects in the CsPbBr3-QD optical cavity. We observe that strong
coupling enables a significant reduction of the photoemission linewidth, as
well as the ultrafast switching of the optical absorption, controllable by
means of the excitation fluence. We find that the interplay of the polariton
states with the large dark state reservoir play a decisive role in determining
the dynamics of the emission and transient absorption properties of the
hybridized light-quantum dot solid system. Our results open the route for the
investigation of PQD solids as polaritonic optoelectronic materials.

<br>
<br>
Ion intercalation of perovskite oxides in liquid electrolytes is a very
promising method for controlling their functional properties while storing
charge, which opens the potential application in different energy and
information technologies. Although the role of defect chemistry in the oxygen
intercalation in a gaseous environment is well established, the mechanism of
ion intercalation in liquid electrolytes at room temperature is poorly
understood. In this study, the defect chemistry during ion intercalation of
La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-{\delta} thin films in alkaline electrolytes is studied. Oxygen
and proton intercalation into the LSF perovskite structure is observed at
moderate electrochemical potentials (0.5 V to -0.4 V), giving rise to a change
in the oxidation state of Fe (as a charge compensation mechanism). The
variation of the concentration of holes as a function of the intercalation
potential was characterized by in-situ ellipsometry and the concentration of
electron holes was indirectly quantified for different electrochemical
potentials. Finally, a dilute defect chemistry model that describes the
variation of defect species during ionic intercalation was developed.

<h3>Half-filled stripe to N$\acute e$el antiferromagnetism transition in the  $t'$-Hubbard model on honeycomb lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the ground state of the doped Hubbard model on honeycomb lattice
with both nearest ($t$) and next-nearest neighboring hoppings ($t'$) in the
small doping and strongly interacting region. Previous study on the model
without $t'$ showed the ground state is a half-filled stripe. We employ density
matrix renormalization group and extrapolate the results with truncation errors
in the converged region. In the $t' < 0$ side, we find the half-filled stripe
phase at $t' = 0$ is stable against the frustration of $t'$ until a critical
point $-0.4 < t'_c < -0.3$, beyond which the ground state switches to
anti-ferromagnetic N$\acute e$el phase with charge modulation. With further
increase of $t'$ to $-0.7$, the ground state becomes paramagnetic. In the $t' >
0$ side, the half-filled stripe stretches to $t' \approx 0.7$. We don't find
obvious enhancement of pairing for the range of $t'$ studied. We study width-4
cylinders in this work but the results for spin, charge, and pairing
correlation agree qualitatively for periodic and anti-periodic boundary
conditions in the half-filled stripe and anti-ferromagnetic N$\acute e$el
phases, suggesting the results are likely to be representative for true
two-dimensional systems. The half-filled stripe to anti-ferromagnetic N$\acute
e$el phase transition can be realized on real materials or ultra-cold atom
platform.

<h3>Magnetoelectric energy in electrodynamics: Magnetoelectricity,  bi(an)isotropy, and magnetoelectric meta-atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10906</a>
<br>
<i>E. O. Kamenetskii</i>
<br>
<br>
In materials with an intrinsic magnetoelectric (ME) effect, the energy
density comprises the polarization, magnetization and ME energy densities.
These three components of energy define local (subwavelength) characteristics
of electromagnetic (EM) responses in multiferroic materials. In a subwavelength
domain, coupling between the electric and magnetic dipole oscillations forms
the ME field structures which are characterized by the violation of both
spatial and temporal symmetry. Unlike multiferroics, bi(an)isotropic
metamaterials are associated with an EM response characterized only by spatial
symmetry breaking. This also applies to chiral materials. Since no intrinsic
magnetoelectricity is assumed in such structures, any concepts about the stored
ME energy are not applicable. This clearly points to the effect of nonlocality.
That is why the basic concepts of bi(an)isotropy can only be analyzed by the EM
far field characteristics. In this paper, we argue that in the implementation
of local (subwavelength) ME meta atoms and systems for near field probing of
chirality, the concept on ME energy is crucial. Real ME energy can occur when
ME fields in a singular subwavelength domain are characterized by a violation
of both the symmetry of time reversal and spatial reflection.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of a quench from a one-dimensional gas with strong
and repulsive local interactions to a strongly attractive one, known as the
super-Tonks-Girardeau effect. By incorporating both an optical lattice and
non-local interactions, we discover a previously unexplored phenomenon: the
disruption of the state during the quench, but within a specific range of
interactions. Our study employs the extended Bose-Hubbard model across various
system sizes, starting with analytical results for two atoms and progressing to
few-body systems using exact diagonalization, DMRG and TDVP methods. Finally,
we use a numerical implementation of the local density approximation for a
macroscopic number of atoms. Consistently, our findings unveil a region where
the initially self-bound structure expands due to the super-Tonks-Girardeau
quench. The fast evaporation can be used as a tool to characterize the phase
diagram in an experiment.

<h3>Three-Body Interactions of Lipid Membrane-Deforming Colloidal Spheres</h3>

Many cell functions require a concerted effort from multiple membrane
proteins, for example, for signaling, cell division, and endocytosis. One
contribution to their successful self-organization stems from the membrane
deformations that these proteins induce. While the pairwise interaction
potential of two membrane deforming spheres has recently been measured,
membrane-deformation induced interactions have been predicted to be
non-additive and hence their collective behavior cannot be deduced from this
measurement. We here employ a colloidal model system consisting of adhesive
spheres and giant unilamellar vesicles to test these predictions by measuring
the interaction potential of the simplest case of three membrane-deforming
spherical particles. We quantify their interactions and arrangements and for
the first time experimentally confirm and quantify the non-additive nature of
membrane-deformation induced interactions. We furthermore conclude that there
exist two favorable configurations on the membrane: (1) a linear, and (2) a
triangular arrangement of the three spheres. Using Monte Carlo simulation we
corroborate the experimentally observed energy minima and identify a lowering
of the membrane deformation as the cause for the observed configurations. The
high symmetry of the preferred arrangements for three particles suggests that
arrangements of many membrane-deforming objects might follow simple rules.

Ti and Cr beryllides are materials of potential importance as neutron
multipliers for tritium breeding in nuclear fusion reactors. The n-to-2n
transmutation reaction also produces tritium and helium, which form bubbles.
Neutron irradiation from fusion plasma also introduces point defects. The
effect on beryllides' microstructure is important for understanding their
mechanical properties and evolution in the fusion reactor environment. This
study determines and describes the microstructural features that occur in
TiBe12 and CrBe12 when He and fast-particle-induced point defects are
introduced at fusion reactor neutron breeder relevant temperatures. Beryllide
samples were implanted with 300kV He at temperatures between
$387-900^{\circ}C$, sectioned down through the implantation surface with a
focused ion beam post-irradiation, and the resulting microstructures examined
using transmission electron microscopy, electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
and precession diffraction mapping. Nanometre bubbles grew in both TiBe12 and
CrBe12 at $600^{\circ}C$; larger (100 nm and over) bubbles, some faceted, grew
at $900^{\circ}C$. Some bubbles in CrBe12 were lined with Cr, some oxidised.
TiBe12 developed planar faults, on $\{110\}$ planes at $600^{\circ}C$ and below
but on $\{111\}$ at $900^{\circ}C$. Faults were preferentially associated with
large bubbles. The displacement vectors of faults on the $\{110\}$ planes had
some commonality with previous studies that found displacement vectors of
families $R=\langle 011\rangle$ and $R= \langle 110\rangle$; the present study
also found faults that matched neither previously found type. CrBe12 also
developed planar faults with an appearance quite different from the typical
striped appearance of planar stacking faults; their nature remains unknown.
Oxide particles were found in both beryllides, most prominently in CrBe12.

<h3>Exploring quasiprobability approach to quantum work in the presence of  initial coherence: Advantages of the Margenau-Hill distribution</h3>

In quantum thermodynamics, the two-projective-measurement (TPM) scheme
provides a successful description of stochastic work only in the absence of
initial quantum coherence. Extending the quantum work distribution to
quasiprobability is a general approach to characterize work fluctuation in the
presence of initial coherence. However, among a large number of different
definitions, there is no consensus on the most appropriate work
quasiprobability. In this article, we list several physically reasonable
requirements including the first law of thermodynamics, time-reversal symmetry,
positivity of second-order moment, and a support condition for the work
distribution. We prove that the only definition that satisfies all these
requirements is the Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobability of work. In this sense,
the MH quasiprobability of work shows its advantages over other definitions. As
an illustration, we calculate the MH work distribution of a breathing harmonic
oscillator with initial squeezed states and show the convergence to classical
work distribution in the classical limit.

<i>Cecile Monthus</i>
<br>
<br>
Behind the nice unification provided by the notion of the level 2.5 in the
field of large deviations for time-averages over a long Markov trajectory,
there are nevertheless very important qualitative differences between the
meaning of the level 2.5 for diffusion processes on one hand, and the meaning
of the level 2.5 for Markov chains either in discrete-time or in
continuous-time on the other hand. In order to analyze these differences in
detail, it is thus useful to consider two types of random walks converging
towards a given diffusion process in dimension $d$ involving arbitrary
space-dependent forces and diffusion coefficients, namely (i) continuous-time
random walks on the regular lattice of spacing $b$ ; (ii) discrete-time random
walks in continuous space with a small time-step $\tau$. One can then analyze
how the large deviations at level 2.5 for these two types of random walks
behave in the limits $b \to 0$ and $\tau \to 0$ respectively, in order to
describe how the fluctuations of some empirical observables of the random walks
are suppressed in the limit of diffusion processes. One can then also study the
limits $b \to 0$ and $\tau \to 0$ for any trajectory observable of the random
walks that can be decomposed on its empirical density and its empirical flows
in order to see how it is projected on the appropriate trajectory observable of
the diffusion process involving its empirical density and its empirical
current.

<br>
<br>
5$d$ transition metal oxides host a variety of exotic phases due to the
comparable strength of Coulomb repulsion and spin-orbit coupling. Herein, by
pursuing density-functional studies on a delta-doped quasi-two-dimensional
iridate Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, where a single SrO layer is replaced by LaO layer,
we predict the formation of a spin-orbital entangled two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) which is sharply confined on two IrO$_2$ layers close to the LaO
layer. In this bilayer crystal structure, an existing potential well is further
augmented with the inclusion of positively charged LaO layer which results in
confining the extra valence electron made available by the La$^{3+}$ ion. The
confined electron is bound along crystal $a$ direction and is highly mobile in
the $bc$ plane. From the band structure point of view, now the existing
half-filled $J_{eff}$ = 1/2 states are further electron doped to destroy the
antiferromagnetic Mott insulating state of IrO$_2$ layers near to the
delta-doped layer. This leads to partially occupied Ir upper-Hubbard subbands
which host the spin-orbital entangled 2DEG. The IrO$_2$ layers far away from
the interface remain insulating and preserve the collinear G-type magnetic
ordering of pristine Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The conductivity tensors calculated
using semi-classical Boltzmann theory at room temperature reveal that the 2DEG
exhibits large electrical conductivity of the order of 10$^{19}$.

<br>

<br>
<br>
Spin excitations that soften near the onset of magnetic order have long been
known to act as `paramagnon' pairing glue that can drive spin-triplet
superconductivity. Recent findings of superconductivity in graphene bilayers
and trilayers, occurring in the proximity of different itinerant ordered phases
polarized in isospin (spin and valley), have motivated us to conduct a
comprehensive investigation of an isospin extension of the paramagnon pairing
mechanism in the vicinity of spin/isospin orders. In each case, we identify a
soft mode, associated with the order parameter fluctuations, that mediates
pairing interaction. We develop an approach that relates the soft mode
described through summation of the contributions most strongly divergent at the
onset of spin/valley isospin orders. This interaction is not always attractive,
but if it is, it gives rise to an enhancement of superconducting $T_c$ in an
appropriate pairing channel. In the cases when the pairing interaction is
attractive, it leads to the formation of a superconducting state which can be
either spin-triplet and valley-singlet or vice versa, depending on the specific
isospin order type. These findings demonstrate that the occurrence of
superconductivity in the vicinity of an itinerant magnetic phase is a generic
phenomenon, closely mirroring experimental observations.

We present a study of the damping and spin pumping properties of CoFeB/X/Pt
systems with $\rm X=Al,Cr$ and $Ta$. We show that the total damping of the
CoFeB/Pt systems is strongly reduced when an interlayer is introduced
independently of the material. Using a model that considers spin relaxation, we
identify the origin of this contribution in the magnetically polarized Pt
formed by the magnetic proximity effect (MPE), which is suppressed by the
introduction of the interlayer. The induced ferromagnetic order in the Pt layer
is confirmed by transverse magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy at the M$_{2,3}$
and N$_7$ absorption edges as an element-sensitive probe. We discuss the impact
of the MPE on parameter extraction in the spin transport model.

The rational function approximation provides a natural and interpretable
representation of response functions such as the many-body spectral functions.
We apply the Vector Fitting (VFIT) algorithm to fit a variety of spectral
functions calculated from the Holstein model of electron-phonon interactions.
We show that the resulting rational functions are highly efficient in their
fitting of sharp features in the spectral functions, and could provide a means
to infer physically relevant information from a spectral dataset. The position
of the peaks in the approximated spectral function are determined by the
location of poles in the complex plane. In addition, we developed an enhanced
version of VFIT by introducing a regularization parameter that is slowly
annealed to zero. With this new procedure, we demonstrate it is possible to
achieve accurate spectral function fits that vary smoothly as a function of
physical conditions.

<br>
<br>
Interactions among charge carriers in graphene can lead to the spontaneous
breaking of multiple degeneracies. When increasing the number of graphene
layers following rhombohedral stacking, the dominant role of Coulomb
interactions becomes pronounced due to the significant reduction in kinetic
energy. In this study, we employ phonon-polariton assisted near-field infrared
imaging to determine the stacking orders of tetralayer graphene devices.
Through quantum transport measurements, we observe a range of spontaneous
broken-symmetry states and their transitions, which can be finely tuned by
carrier density n and electric displacement field D. Specifically, we observe a
layer antiferromagnetic insulator at n = D = 0 with a gap of approximately 15
meV. Increasing D allows for a continuous phase transition from a layer
antiferromagnetic insulator to a layer polarized insulator. By simultaneously
tuning n and D, we observe isospin polarized metals, including
spin-valley-polarized and spin-polarized metals. These transitions are
associated with changes in Fermi surface topology and are consistent with the
Stoner criteria. Our findings highlight the efficient fabrication of specially
stacked multilayer graphene devices and demonstrate that crystalline multilayer
graphene is an ideal platform for investigating a wide range of broken
symmetries driven by Coulomb interactions.

We develop a Machine-Learning Renormalization Group (MLRG) algorithm to
explore and analyze many-body lattice models in statistical physics. Using the
representation learning capability of generative modeling, MLRG automatically
learns the optimal renormalization group (RG) transformations from
self-generated spin configurations and formulates RG equations without human
supervision. The algorithm does not focus on simulating any particular lattice
model but broadly explores all possible models compatible with the internal and
lattice symmetries given the on-site symmetry representation. It can uncover
the RG monotone that governs the RG flow, assuming a strong form of the
$c$-theorem. This enables several downstream tasks, including unsupervised
classification of phases, automatic location of phase transitions or critical
points, controlled estimation of critical exponents and operator scaling
dimensions. We demonstrate the MLRG method in two-dimensional lattice models
with Ising symmetry and show that the algorithm correctly identifies and
characterizes the Ising criticality.

useful. This paper describes recent developments in our simulation
infrastructure to address modern data needs. nanoHUB's Sim2Ls (pronounced sim
tools) make simulation, modeling, and data workflows discoverable and
accessible to all users for cloud computing using standard APIs. In addition,
published tools are findable (with digital object identifiers), reusable (via
documented requirements and services), and reproducible via containerization.
In addition, all Sim2L runs are automatically cached, and their results indexed
into a global and queryable database (ResultsDB). We believe this
infrastructure significantly lowers the barriers towards making simulation/data
workflows and their data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
(FAIR). This frictionless access to simulations and data enables researchers,
instructors, and students to focus on the application of these products to
advance their fields.

Motivated by the superconductivity near paraelectric (PE) to ferroelectric
(FE) quantum critical point (QCP) in polar metals, we study polar fluctuation
mediated superconductivity in multi-orbital systems. The PE to FE QCP is
approached by softening of a transverse optical (TO) phonon that is odd under
inversion ($\mathcal{I}$). We show that the necessary and sufficient condition
for the linear coupling between electron-TO phonon is the presence of multiple
orbitals on the Fermi-surface, irrespective of the spin-orbital (SO) coupling,
multiple electronic bands, or the vicinity to band crossings. We show that the
linear coupling to the polar fluctuations (such as TO modes) can generally lead
to superconductivity. We also show that irrespective of the strong $\vec{k}$
dependence of the effective electron-electron interaction in the BCS channel,
quite generally the even-parity channel leads to the highest critical
temperature. In the presence of additional repulsive electron-electron
interactions, an odd-parity spin-triplet channel can become the leading BCS
instability. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of the
superconductivity in $\text{SrTiO}_3$ and $\text{KTaO}_3$ that highlights the
importance of the underlying multi-orbital physics if the superconductivity is
mediated by the polar fluctuations.

Data-driven (DD) interatomic potentials (IPs) trained on large collections of
first principles calculations are rapidly becoming essential tools in the
fields of computational materials science and chemistry for performing
atomic-scale simulations. Despite this, apart from a few notable exceptions,
there is a distinct lack of well-organized, public datasets in common formats
available for use with IP development. This deficiency precludes the research
community from implementing widespread benchmarking, that is essential for
gaining insight into model performance and transferability, while also limiting
the development of more general, or even universal, IPs. To address this issue,
we introduce the ColabFit Exchange, the first database providing open access to
a large collection of systematically organized datasets from multiple domains
that is especially designed for IP development. The ColabFit Exchange is
publicly-available at \url{https://colabfit.org/}, providing a web-based
interface for exploring, downloading, and contributing datasets. Comprised of
data collected from the literature or provided by community researchers, the
ColabFit Exchange consists of 106 datasets spanning nearly 70,000 unique
chemistries, and is intended to continuously grow. In addition to outlining the
software framework used for constructing and accessing the CE, we also provide
analyses of the CE, quantifying the diversity of the database and proposing
metrics for assessing the relative quality and atomic environment coverage of
different datasets. Finally, we demonstrate an end-to-end IP development
pipeline, utilizing datasets from the CE, fitting tools from the KLIFF software
package, and validation tests provided by the OpenKIM framework.

<h3>Re-entrant topological phase transition in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic  lattice</h3>

We predict a re-entrant topological transition in a one dimensional
non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice. By considering a non-Hermitian generalized
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model with quasiperiodic potential, we show that the
system first undergoes a transition from the delocalized phase to the localized
phase and then to the delocalized phase as a function of the hermiticity
breaking parameter. This re-entrant delocalization-localization-delocalization
transition in turn results in a re-entrant topological transition identified by
associating the phases with spectral winding numbers. Moreover, we find that
these two transitions occur through intermediate phases hosting both extended
and localized states having real and imaginary energies, respectively. We find
that these phases also possess non-trivial winding numbers which are different
from that of the localized phase.

Quantum spin liquids hosting non-abelian anyons have recently experienced
renewed interest following the discovery of a variety of materials proximate to
these quantum phases. Their anyonic excitations have potential for application
to topological quantum computation, but designing logical operations with
reduced poisoning requires developing protocols to faithfully create, move and
read-out such quasiparticles. In this paper, we present one such protocol for
manipulating $Z_2$ fluxes (``visons'') of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
Kitaev models perturbed by a small uniform magnetic field. Our design employs a
local driving magnetic field and can achieve high probabilities of generating
and displacing flux pairs of both the $A_z$ and $B$ phases of the model.

<h3>Hubbard Model on Triangular Lattice: Role of Charge Fluctuations</h3>

A chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase has been recently reported in the Hubbard
model on a triangular lattice at half-filling. It emerges in an intermediate
coupling regime, which is sandwiched between a $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic
(AFM) phase and a metallic phase as a function of on-site repulsion $U$. In
this work, we examine how the charge fluctuation may cause the CSL and complex
phase diagram. We first identify an exact sign structure of the model at
arbitrary temperature, sample size, and doping, which is reduced from the
original Fermi exchange signs of the electrons by finite $U$. In particular,
the spin and charge degrees of freedom are generally entangled via the
phase-string in the sign structure. By precisely switching off such a
phase-string, the CSL phase is shown to disappear, with only the $120^\circ$
AFM order remaining down to weak $U$ by a density matrix renormalization group
calculation. Here the charge fluctuation is effectively decoupled from the AFM
background, which is a $120^\circ$ AFM order due to a geometric Berry phase in
the sign structure of the triangular lattice. General implications for the Mott
physics will also be discussed.

Color centers in diamond are at the forefront of the second quantum
revolution. A handful of defects are in use, and finding new ones with all the
desired properties for quantum applications is arduous. By using
high-throughput calculations, we screen 21607 defects in diamond and collect
the results in the ADAQ database. Upon exploring this database, we find not
only the known defects but also several unexplored defects. Specifically,
defects containing sodium stand out as particularly relevant because of their
high spins and predicted improved optical properties compared to the NV-center.
Hence, we studied these in detail, employing high-accuracy theoretical
calculations. The single sodium substitutional (Na$\mathrm{_C}$) has various
charge states with spin ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, ZPL in the near infrared, and
a high Debye-Waller factor, making it ideal for biological quantum
applications. The sodium vacancy (NaV) has a ZPL in the visible region and a
potential rare spin-2 ground state. Our results show sodium implantation yields
many interesting spin defects that are valuable additions to the arsenal of
point defects in diamond studied for quantum applications.

<h3>Chiral active matter in external potentials</h3>

<br>
<i>Lorenzo Caprini, Hartmut Löwen, Umberto Marini Bettolo Marconi</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the interplay between chirality and confinement induced by the
presence of an external potential. For potentials having radial symmetry, the
circular character of the trajectories induced by the chiral motion reduces the
spatial fluctuations of the particle, thus providing an extra effective
confining mechanism, that can be interpreted as a lowering of the effective
temperature. In the case of non-radial potentials, for instance, with an
elliptic shape, chirality displays a richer scenario. Indeed, the chirality can
break the parity symmetry of the potential that is always fullfilled in the
non-chiral system. The probability distribution displays a strong
non-Maxwell-Boltzmann shape that emerges in cross-correlations between the two
Cartesian components of the position, that vanishes in the absence of chirality
or when radial symmetry of the potential is restored. These results are
obtained by considering two popular models in active matter, i.e. chiral Active
Brownian particles and chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles.

We study the superconducting Josephson junction diode operating via the
magnetic field of skyrmions. Inspired by the near-field optical microscopy, we
propose to partially screen the magnetic field and analyze part-by-part the
magnetic texture of the skyrmion. The detected asymmetric supercurrent is
influenced by the skyrmionic magnetic field and magnetic texture. This enables
the Josephson junction diode to function as a hyperfine sensor and to read out
the information about the morphology of the complex magnetic textures. The
proposed setup opens a new avenue in magnetometry and represents an alternative
to the technologies based on the nitrogen-vacancy centers.

<h3>Measurement Indued Chirality II: Diffusion and Disorder</h3>

Repeated quantum measurements can generate effective new states of matter.
Here we combine such a measurement driven system with disorder. In particular,
we investigate the diffusive behavior in the system and the effect of various
types of disorder on the measurement induced chiral transport protocol [1]. We
begin by characterizing the diffusive behavior produced by the measurements
themselves in a clean system. We then examine the edge flow of particles per
measurement cycle for three different types of disorder: site dilution, lattice
distortion, and disorder in onsite chemical potential. In the quantum Zeno
limit, the effective descriptions for the disordered measurement system with
lattice distortions and random onsite potential can be modelled as a classical
stochastic model, and the overall effect of increasing these disorders induces
a crossover from perfect flow to zero transport. On the other hand if vacancies
are present in the lattice the flow of particles per measurement cycle
undergoes a percolation phase transition from unity to zero with percolation
threshold $p_c \approx 0.26$, with critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.35$. We
also present numerical results away from Zeno limit and note that the overall
effect of moving away from the Zeno effect is to reduce particle flow per cycle
when the measurement frequency in our protocol is reduced

<br>
We consider the Brownian SYK, i.e. a system of $N$ Majorana (Dirac) fermions
with a white-noise $q$-body interaction term. We focus on the dynamics of the
Frame potentials, a measure of the scrambling and chaos, given by the moments
of the overlap between two independent realisations of the model. By means of a
Keldysh path-integral formalism, we compute its early and late-time value. We
show that, for $q>2$, the late time path integral saddle point correctly
reproduces the saturation to the value of the Haar frame potential. On the
contrary, for $q=2$, the model is quadratic and consistently we observe
saturation to the Haar value in the restricted space of Gaussian states
(gaussian Haar). The latter is characterised by larger system size corrections
that we correctly capture by counting the Goldstone modes of the Keldysh saddle
point.

<h3>Kinetics of hydrogen and vacancy diffusion in iron: A Kinetic Activation  Relaxation technique (k-ART) study</h3>

We investigate hydrogen (H) and mono and divacancy-hydrogen complexes (VH$_x$
and V$_2$H$_x$) diffusion in body-centered-cubic (BCC) iron using the kinetic
Activation-Relaxation Technique (k-ART), an off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo
approach with on-the-fly event catalog building, to explore diffusion barriers
and associated mechanisms for these defects. K-ART uncovers complex diffusion
pathways for the bound complexes, with important barrier variations that depend
on the geometrical relations between the position of the inserting Fe atom and
that of the bound H. Since H is small and brings little lattice deformation
around itself, these bound complexes are compact and H is fully unbound at the
second neighbour site already. As more H are added, however, vacancies deform
and affect the lattice over longer distances, contributing to increasing the
VH$_x$ complex diffusion barrier and its impact on its local environment. We
find, moreover, that the importance of this trapping decreases when going from
mono to divacancy complexes, although diffusion barriers for these complexes
increase with the number of trapped H.

<h3>Giant optical nonlinearity of Fermi polarons in atomically thin  semiconductors</h3>

Realizing strong nonlinear optical responses is a long-standing goal of both
fundamental and technological importance. Recently significant efforts have
focused on exploring excitons in solids as a pathway to achieving
nonlinearities even down to few-photon levels. However, a crucial tradeoff
arises as strong light-matter interactions require large oscillator strength
and short radiative lifetime of the excitons, which limits their interaction
strength and nonlinearity. Here we experimentally demonstrate strong nonlinear
optical responses by exploiting the coupling between excitons and carriers in
an atomically thin semiconductor of trilayer tungsten diselenide. By
controlling the electric field and electrostatic doping of the trilayer, we
observe the hybridization between intralayer and interlayer excitons along with
the formation of Fermi polarons due to the interactions between excitons and
free carriers. We find substantial optical nonlinearity can be achieved under
both continuous wave and pulsed laser excitation, where the resonance of the
hole-doped Fermi polaron blueshifts by as much as ~10 meV. Intriguingly, we
observe a remarkable asymmetry in the optical nonlinearity between electron and
hole doping, which is tunable by the applied electric field. We attribute these
features to the strong interactions between excitons and free charges with
optically induced valley polarization. Our results establish that atomically
thin heterostructures are a highly versatile platform for engineering nonlinear
optical response with applications to classical and quantum optoelectronics,
and open avenues for exploring many-body physics in hybrid Fermionic-Bosonic
systems.

<h3>Nematic Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces from magnetic toroidal order in  FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently it has been argued that the superconducting state of
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ exhibits Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces for $x>0.17$. These
Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces appear together with broken time-reversal symmetry
and surprisingly demonstrate nematic behavior in a structurally tetragonal
phase. Through a symmetry-based analysis of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces that can
arise from broken time-reversal symmetry, we argue that the likely origin of
time-reversal symmetry breaking is due to magnetic toroidal order. We show that
this magnetic toroidal order naturally appears as a consequence of either
static N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic order or due to the formation of a
spontaneous pair density wave superconducting order. Finally, we reveal that
independent of the presence of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, supercurrents will
induce N\'{e}el magnetic order in many Fe-based superconductors.

Motivated by the recent discovery of odd-parity multipolar antiferromagnetic
order in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we examine the coexistence of such translation
invariant Kramers' degenerate magnetic states and superconductivity. We show
that the presence of such magnetic states generically suppresses
superconductivity, whether it be spin-singlet or spin-triplet, unless the
magnetic state drives a symmetry-required pair density wave (PDW)
superconducting order. We apply our results to CeRh$_2$As$_2$, where no pair
density wave order appears; and to the loop current order in the cuprates,
where such pair density wave superconductivity must appear together with
Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. In the former case, we explain why superconductivity
is not suppressed.

A vortex beam, akin to a quantized vortex in superfluids, possesses inherent
orbital angular momentum (OAM), resulting in the propagation of a spiral-shaped
wavefront. Here we demonstrate that a pulsed vortex beam with OAM in the
terahertz frequency band can induce a spiral Higgs wave, which is a
spiral-shaped oscillation mode of the superconducting order parameter. By
utilizing the gauge-invariant theory for the superconducting order, we
demonstrate that the phase mode is driven to screen the longitudinal magnetic
field of the vortex beam, which facilitates the imprinting of the spiral-shaped
wavefront and the transfer of OAM to the condensate. Furthermore, we find that
increasing the OAM of light amplifies the intensity of the third harmonic
generation. These findings highlight the potential of terahertz vortex beams as
a spectroscopic probe of collective modes.

<h3>Universal behavior in fragmenting brittle, isotropic solids across  material properties</h3>

<br>
<i>Joel T. Clemmer, Mark O. Robbins</i>
<br>
<br>
A bonded particle model is used to explore how variations in the material
properties of brittle, isotropic solids affect critical behavior in
fragmentation. To control material properties, a new model is proposed which
includes breakable two- and three-body particle interactions to calibrate
elastic moduli and mode I and II fracture toughnesses. In the quasistatic
limit, fragmentation leads to a power-law distribution of grain sizes which is
truncated at a maximum grain mass that grows as a non-trivial power of system
size. In the high-rate limit, truncation occurs at a mass that decreases as a
power of increasing rate. A scaling description is used to characterize this
behavior by collapsing the mean squared grain mass across rates and system
sizes. Consistent scaling persists across all material properties studied
although there are differences in the evolution of grain size distributions
with strain as the initial number of grains at fracture and their subsequent
rate of production depend on Poisson's ratio. This evolving granular structure
is found to induce a unique rheology where the ratio of the shear stress to
pressure, an internal friction coefficient, decays approximately as the
logarithm of increasing strain rate. The stress ratio also decreases at all
rates with increasing strain as fragmentation progresses.

Electronic Raman scattering in the fully symmetric channel couples to the
charge excitations in the system, including the plasmons. However, the plasmon
response has a spectral weight of $\sim q^2$, where $q$, the momentum
transferred by light, is small. In this work, we show that in inversion
symmetry broken systems where Rashba type spin-orbit coupling affects the
states at the Fermi energy (which is a known low energy effect) as well as the
transition elements to other states (a high energy effect), there is an
additional coupling of the plasmons to the Raman vertex, even at zero momentum
transfer, that results in a spectral weight that is proportional to the
spin-orbit coupling. The high energy effect is due to the breaking of SU(2)
spin invariance in the spin-flip transitions to the intermediate state. We
present a theory for this coupling near the resonant regime of Raman scattering
and show that in giant Rashba systems it can dominate over the conventional
$q^2$ weighted coupling. We also provide experimental support along with a
symmetry based justification for this spin-mediated coupling by identifying a
prominent c-axis plasmon peak in the fully symmetric channel of the resonant
Raman spectrum of the giant Rashba material BiTeI. This new coupling could lead
to novel ways of manipulating coherent charge excitations in inversion-broken
systems. This process is also relevant for spectroscopic studies in ultrafast
spectroscopies, certain driven Floquet systems and topologically non-trivial
phases of matter where strong inversion-breaking spin-orbit coupling plays a
role.

<h3>Dynamical nuclear spin polarization in a quantum dot with an EDSR-driven  electron spin</h3>

<br>
<br>
We analyze the polarization of nuclear spins in a quantum dot induced by a
single-electron spin that is electrically driven to perform coherent Rabi
oscillations. We derive the associated nuclear-spin polarization rate and
analyze its dependence on the accessible control parameters, especially the
detuning of the driving frequency from the electron Larmor frequency. The
arising nuclear-spin polarization is related to the Hartmann-Hahn effect known
from the NMR literature with two important differences. First, in quantum dots
one typically uses a micro magnet, leading to a small deflection of the
quantization axes of the electron and nuclear spins. Second, the electric
driving wiggles the electron with respect to the atomic lattice. The two
effects, absent in the traditional Hartmann-Hahn scenario, give rise to two
mechanisms of nuclear-spin polarization in gated quantum dots. The arising
nuclear-spin polarization is a resonance phenomenon, achieving maximal
efficiency at the resonance of the electron Rabi and nuclear Larmor frequency
(typically a few or a few tens of MHz). As a function of the driving frequency,
the polarization rate can develop sharp peaks and reach large values at them.
Since the nuclear polarization is experimentally detected as changes of the
electron Larmor frequency, we often convert the former to the latter in our
formulas and figures. In these units, the polarization can reach hundreds of
MHz/s in GaAs quantum dots and at least tens of kHz/s in Si quantum dots. We
analyze possibilities to exploit the resonant polarization effects for
achieving large nuclear polarization and for stabilizing the Overhauser field
through feedback.

<br>
<br>
The electrical transport properties of Pb$_x$(TiO$_2$)$_{1-x}$ ($x$ being the
Pb volume fraction) granular films are investigated experimentally. The
charging energy of the Pb granules is reduced to less than the superconducting
gap of Pb granules for the low temperature insulating films by using high-$k$
dielectric TiO$_2$ as the insulating matrix. For the insulating films in the
vicinity of the superconductor-insulator transition, Cooper-pair hopping
governs the low-temperature hopping transport. For these films, the
low-temperature magnetoresistance is positive at low field and the resistivity
vs temperature for Cooper-pair hopping obeys an Efros-Shklovsii-type
variable-range-hopping law. A crossover from Cooper-pair-dominated hopping to
single-electron-dominated hopping is observed with decreasing $x$. The
emergence of single-electron-dominated hopping in the more insulating films is
due to the causation that the intergrain Josephson coupling becomes too weak
for Cooper pairs to hop between adjacent superconducting Pb granules.

<h3>Unlocking the Inaccessible Energy Density of Sodium Vanadium  Fluorophosphate Electrode Materials by Transition Metal Mixing</h3>

Sodium (Na) vanadium (V) fluorophosphate $\mathrm{Na_xV_2(PO_4)_2F_3}$ (NVPF)
is a highly attractive intercalation electrode material due to its high
operation voltage, large capacity, and long cycle life. However, several issues
limit the full utilization of NVPF's energy density: 1) the high voltage
plateau associated with extracting the "third" Na ion in the reaction N$_1$VPF
$\rightarrow$ VPF (~4.9 V vs Na/Na$^+$) appears above the electrochemical
stability window of most practical electrolytes (~4.5 V); 2) a sudden drop in
Na-ion diffusivity is observed near composition $\mathrm{Na_1V_2(PO_4)_2F_3}$.
Therefore, it is important to investigate the potential substitution of V by
other transition metals in NVPF derivatives, which can access the extraction of
the third Na-ion. In this work, we investigate the partial substitution of V
with molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), or tungsten (W) in NVPF to improve its
energy density. We examine the structural and electrochemical behaviors of
$\mathrm{Na_xV_{2-y}Mo_y(PO_4)_2F_3}$, $\mathrm{Na_xV_{2-y}Nb_y(PO_4)_2F_3}$,
and $\mathrm{Na_xW_{2}(PO_4)_2F_3}$ across the whole Na composition region of 0
$\leq$ x $\leq$ 4, and at various transition metal substitution levels, namely,
y=0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 for Mo, and y=1.0, 2.0 for Nb. We find that partial
substitution of 50% V by Mo in NVPF reduces the voltage plateau for extracting
the third Na ion by 0.6 Volts, which enables further Na extraction from
$\mathrm{Na_1Mo_{2}(PO_4)_2F_3}$ and increases the theoretical gravimetric
capacity from ~128 to ~174 mAh/g. Analysis of the migration barriers for
Na-ions in $\mathrm{Na_xVMo(PO_4)_2F_3}$ unveils improved kinetic properties
over NVPF. The proposed $\mathrm{Na_xVMo(PO_4)_2F_3}$ material provides an
optimal gravimetric energy density of ~577.3 Wh/kg versus ~507 Wh/kg for the
pristine NVPF, which amounts to an increase of ~13.9%.

We performed magnetization, resistivity, and neutron diffraction measurements
under uniaxial stress applied along [1-10] direction on the tetragonal magnet
CeRh$_2$Si$_2$ with commensurate magnetic orders.
CeRh$_2$Si$_2$ has two successive antiferromagnetic (AF) orders in zero
magnetic field.
The high temperature phase (AF1 phase) has the magnetic modulation wave
vector of $q = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$, and the low temperature phase
(AF2 phase) is characterized by the four $q$-vectors of $q = (\frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}, 0), (\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 0), (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2})$, and $(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$.
By measuring the uniaxial stress dependence of the magnetization, resistivity
and the intensities of magnetic Bragg reflections, we confirmed that the AF1
phase has the single-$q$ magnetic order with two-fold rotational symmetry and
the AF2 phase has the multi-$q$ magnetic order with four-fold rotational
symmetry.
In order to understand the origin of multi-$q$ order of CeRh$_2$Si$_2$, we
also performed inelastic neutron scattering measurement on the single crystal
samples.
We found a magnetic excitation at the transfer energy $\hbar \omega \sim$ 8
meV.
By applying the linear spin-wave theory\cite{Squires}, we found that the
nearest and the next-nearest neighbor exchange interactions on the $ab$-plane,
$J_1$ and $J_2$, are dominant in the AF2 phase.
However, the $J_1$-$J_2$ model cannot lift the degeneracy between the
single-$q$ (AF1) and multi-$q$ (AF2) phases.
We suggest that it can be lifted by taking into account the biquadratic
interaction derived from the perturbative expansion for the Kondo lattice
Hamiltonian. [S. Hayami et al., Phys. Rev. B 95, 224424 (2017).

Selenium has resurged as a promising photovoltaic material in solar cell
research due to its wide direct bandgap of 1.95 eV, making it a suitable
candidate for a top cell in tandem photovoltaic devices. However, the
optoelectronic quality of selenium thin-films has been identified as a key
bottleneck for realizing high-efficiency selenium solar cells. In this study,
we present a novel approach for crystallizing selenium thin-films using
laser-annealing as an alternative to the conventionally used thermal annealing
strategy. By laser-annealing through a semitransparent substrate, a buried
layer of high-quality selenium crystallites is formed and used as a growth
template for solid-phase epitaxy. The resulting selenium thin-films feature
larger and more preferentially oriented grains with a negligible surface
roughness in comparison to thermally annealed selenium thin-films. We fabricate
photovoltaic devices using this strategy, and demonstrate a record ideality
factor of n=1.37, a record fill factor of FF=63.7%, and a power conversion
efficiency of PCE=5.0%. The presented laser-annealing strategy is universally
applicable and is a promising approach for crystallizing a wide range of
photovoltaic materials where high temperatures are needed while maintaining a
low substrate temperature.

The respective unique merit of antiferromagnets and two-dimensional (2D)
materials in spintronic applications inspire us to exploit 2D antiferromagnetic
spintronics. However, the detection of the N\'eel vector in 2D antiferromagnets
remains a great challenge because the measured signals usually decrease
significantly in the 2D limit. Here we propose that the N\'eel vector of 2D
antiferromagnets can be efficiently detected by the intrinsic nonlinear Hall
(INH) effect which exhibits unexpected significant signals. As a specific
example, we show that the INH conductivity of the monolayer manganese
chalcogenides Mn$X$ ($X$=S, Se, Te) can reach the order of nm$\cdot$mA/V$^2$,
which is orders of magnitude larger than experimental values of paradigmatic
antiferromagnetic spintronic materials. The INH effect can be accurately
controlled by shifting the chemical potential around the band edge, which is
experimentally feasible via electric gating or charge doping. Moreover, we
explicitly demonstrate its $2\pi$-periodic dependence on the N\'eel vector
orientation based on an effective $k.p$ model. Our findings enable flexible
design schemes and promising material platforms for spintronic memory device
applications based on 2D antiferromagnets.

Halide double perovskites are an emerging class of semiconductors with
tremendous chemical and electronic diversity. While their bandstructure
features can be understood from frontier-orbital models, chemical intuition for
optical excitations remains incomplete. Here, we use \textit{ab initio}
many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation
approach to calculate excited-state properties of a representative range of
Cs$_2$BB$'$Cl$_6$ double perovskites. Our calculations reveal that double
perovskites with different combinations of B and B$'$ cations display a broad
variety of electronic bandstructures and dielectric properties, and form
excitons with binding energies ranging over several orders of magnitude. We
correlate these properties with the orbital-induced anisotropy of
charge-carrier effective masses and the long-range behavior of the dielectric
function, by comparing with the canonical conditions of the Wannier-Mott model.
Furthermore, we derive chemically intuitive rules for predicting the nature of
excitons in halide double perovskites using electronic structure information
obtained from computationally inexpensive DFT calculations.

An antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) bearing a compensated interface to an
adjacent conventional superconductor (S) has recently been predicted to
generate N\'eel triplet Cooper pairs, whose amplitude alternates sign in space.
Here, we theoretically demonstrate that such N\'eel triplets enable control of
the superconducting critical temperature in an S layer via the angle between
the N\'eel vectors of two enclosing AFI layers. This angle dependence changes
sign with the number of S monolayers providing a distinct signature of the
N\'eel triplets. Furthermore, we show that the latter mediate a similarly
distinct exchange interaction between the two AFIs' N\'eel vectors.

<h3>Tracer diffusion coefficients in a moderately dense granular suspension.  Stability analysis and thermal diffusion segregation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The diffusion transport coefficients of a binary granular suspension where
one of the components is present in tracer concentration are determined from
the (inelastic) Enskog kinetic equation. The effect of the interstitial gas on
the solid particles is accounted for in the kinetic equation through two
different terms: (i) a viscous drag force proportional to the particle velocity
and (ii) stochastic Langevin-like term defined in terms of the background
temperature. The transport coefficients are obtained as the solutions of a set
of coupled linear integral equations recently derived for binary granular
suspensions with arbitrary concentration [G\'omez Gonz\'alez \emph{et al.},
Phys. Rev. E \textbf{101}, 012904 (2020)]. To achieve analytical expressions
for the diffusion coefficients, the above integral equations are approximately
solved by considering the so-called second Sonine approximation. The
theoretical results for the tracer diffusion coefficient $D_0$ (coefficient
connecting the mass flux with the gradient of density of tracer particles) are
compared with those obtained by numerically solving the Enskog equation by
means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Although the first-Sonine
approximation to $D_0$ yields in general a good agreement with simulation
results, we show that the second-Sonine approximation leads to an improvement
over the first-Sonine correction, especially when the tracer particles are much
lighter than the granular gas. The expressions derived here for the diffusion
coefficients are also used for two different applications. First, the stability
of the homogeneous steady state is discussed. Second, segregation induced by a
thermal gradient is studied. As expected, the results show that the
corresponding phase diagrams for segregation clearly differ from those found in
previous works when the effect of gas phase on grains is neglected.

The bottom-up synthesis of carbon based nanomaterials directly on
semiconductor surfaces allows to decouple their electronic and magnetic
properties from the substrates. However, the lack of reactivity on these
non-metallic surfaces hinders or reduces significantly the yield of these
reactions. Such hurdles practically precludes transferring bottom-up synthesis
strategies onto semiconducting and insulating surfaces. Here, we achieve a high
polymerization yield of terphenyl molecules on the semiconductor TiO$_2$(110)
surface by incorporating cobalt atoms as catalysts in the Ullmann coupling
reaction. Cobalt atoms trigger the debromination of 4,4-dibromo-p-terphenyl
(DBTP) molecules on TiO$_2$(110) and the formation of an intermediate
organometallic phase already at room-temperature (RT). As the debromination
temperature is drastically reduced, the homo-coupling temperature is also
significantly lowered, preventing the desorption of DBTP molecules from the
TiO$_2$(110) surface and leading to a radical improvement on the
poly-para-phenylene (PPP) polymerization yield. The universality of this
mechanism is demonstrated with an iodinated terphenyl derivative (DITP), which
shows analogous dehalogenation and polymerization temperatures with a very
similar reaction yield. Consequently, we propose to use minute amounts of metal
catalyst to drive forward generic bottom-up synthesis strategies on
non-metallic surfaces.

<h3>High frequency oscillations in spin-torque nano oscillator due to  bilinear coupling</h3>

Exchange coupling in an interfacial context is crucial for spin-torque nano
oscillator (STNO) that consists of a non-magnetic spacer which is alloyed with
a ferromagnetic material. Currently, investigations on the dynamics of the free
layer magnetization and frequency enhancement in the STNO with bilinear
coupling are still being actively pursued. In the present work, we investigate
the dynamics of the STNO in the presence of bilinear coupling but in the
absence of an external magnetic field by analyzing the associated
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Sloncewski(LLGS) equation, and consequently the impact
of the bilinear coupling on the dynamics of the magnetization of the free layer
is studied. It is observed that the frequency of the oscillations in the
magnetization component along the direction of the pinned layer polarization
can be enhanced above 300 GHz by positive bilinear coupling and up to around 30
GHz by negative bilinear coupling. We further reveal a transition from in-plane
to out-of-plane precession both for positive and negative bi-linear couplings.
We also analyze the switching of the magnetization for different values of
current and bilinear coupling. Our detailed investigations of STNO with
bilinear coupling aim at the possibilities of high-frequency devices by
considering the applied current and bilinear coupling in the absence of a
magnetic field.

<h3>Stability and fine structure of symmetry-enriched quantum criticality in  a spin ladder triangular model</h3>

<i>Xiao Wang, Linhao Li, Jianda Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
In this letter, we propose and study a ladder triangular cluster model which
possesses a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and an anti-unitary
$\mathbb{Z}^{\mathbb{T}}_2$ symmetry generated by the spin-flip and complex
conjugation, respectively. The phase diagram of the model hosts a critical line
between a spontaneous symmetry breaking phase and a symmetry protected
topological phase. Along the critical line, one endpoint exhibits
symmetry-enriched Ashkin-Teller universality (SEATU), while other critical
points fall into the symmetry-enriched Ising universality (SEIU). Both
universality classes accommodate symmetry protected degenerate edge modes under
open boundary conditions. This degeneracy can be lifted with a gap opening when
proper perturbation is applied to the boundary. With system size ($L$)
increasing, at the point of SEATU, the gap closes following $L^{-1}$. In
contrast, for the critical points of SEIU apart from a point with the known gap
closing as $L^{-14}$, other points surprisingly show exponentially gap closing.
The coexistence of different gap closing behaviors for critical points of the
same symmetry-enriched universality goes beyond the the usual understanding of
symmetry-enriched universality class, implying a fine and rich structure of
phase transition and universality class.

<h3>Stripes polymorphism and water-like anomaly in hard core-soft corona  dumbbells</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper we investigate the phase diagram of a dumbbell model composed
of two hard-core soft-corona beads through $NpT$ simulations. This particular
system was chosen due to its ability to exhibit a diverse range of stripe
patterns. Analyzing the thermodynamic and structural changes along compression
isotherms, we explore the transition between these distinct patterns. In
addition to the stripe and Low-Density-Triangular solid phases obtained, we
observed a Nematic Anisotropic phase characterized by a polymer-like pattern at
high temperatures and intermediate pressures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
significant role played by the new characteristic length scale, which arises
from the anisotropic geometry of the dumbbell structure, in the transition
between the stripes patterns. Notably, not only do the structural properties
exhibit intriguing behavior, but the diffusion and density in the nematic fluid
phase also displays a water-like anomalous increase under compression. Those
findings can be valuable in guiding the design of materials based on
nanoparticles, with the aim of achieving specific mesopatterns.

In this study, we grow FeSe/SrTiO$_{3}$ with thicknesses of 4-19 nm using
pulsed laser deposition and investigate their magneto-transport properties. The
thinnest film (4 nm) exhibit negative Hall effect, indicating electron transfer
into FeSe from the SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate. This is in agreement with reports on
ultrathin FeSe/SrTiO$_{3}$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The upper critical
field is found to exhibit large anisotropy ($\gamma >$ 11.9), estimated from
the data near the transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$). In particular, the
estimated coherence lengths in the perpendicular direction are 0.15-0.27 nm,
which are smaller than the c-axis length of FeSe, and are found to be almost
independent of the total thicknesses of the films. These results indicate that
superconductivity is confined at the interface of FeSe/SrTiO$_{3}$.

<i>E.Z. Kuchinskii, N.A. Kuleeva, M.V. Sadovskii</i>
<br>
<br>
We present comparative theoretical investigation of thermoelectric power and
Hall effect in the Hubbard model for correlated metal and Mott insulator
(considered as prototype cuprate superconductor) for different concentrations
of current carriers. Analysis is performed within standard DMFT approximation.
For Mott insulator we consider the typical case of partial filling of the lower
Hubbard band (hole doping). We calculate the dependence of thermopower on
doping level and determine the critical concentration of carriers corresponding
to sign change of thermopower. An anomalous dependence of thermopower on
temperature is obtained significantly different from linear temperature
dependence typical for the usual metals. The role of disorder scattering is
analyzed on qualitative level. The comparison with similar studies of the Hall
effect shows, that breaking of electron - hole symmetry leads to the appearance
of the relatively large interval of band - fillings (close to the half -
filling) where thermopower and Hall effects have different signs. We propose a
certain scheme allowing to determine the number of carriers from ARPES data and
perform semi - quantitative estimate of both thermopower and Hall coefficient
using the usual DFT calculations of electronic spectrum.

We theoretically investigate cooperative effects in cold atomic gases
exhibiting both electric and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, such as
occurring for example in clouds of dysprosium atoms. We distinguish between the
quantum degenerate case, where we take a many body physics approach and the
quantum non-degenerate case, where we use the formalism of open system
dynamics. For quantum non-degenerate gases, we illustrate the emergence of
tailorable spin models in the high-excitation limit. In the low-excitation
limit, we provide analytical and numerical results detailing the effect of
magnetic interactions on the directionality of scattered light and characterize
sub- and superradiant effects. For quantum degenerate gases, we study the
interplay between sub- and superradiance effects and the fermionic or bosonic
quantum statistics nature of the ensemble.

Recently, Lu-N-H materials were reported to have room-temperature
superconductivity, and the Hubbard U correction on the Lu's
$\textit{f}$-electrons is necessary, and a constant U = 5.5 eV was applied to
different Lu-N-H configurations (Nature 615, 244 (2023)). Following simulations
with U = 3 eV or without U correction suggest that it may be an unconventional
superconductor. Here, the structural and electronic Lu-N-H properties at
high-pressure (0 ~ 10 GPa) are systematically investigated based on the hybrid
functional. We show that different Lu-N-H configurations should possess
different U values varying from 6.4 eV to 7.4 eV. Furthermore, at pressure
ranging from 0 GPa to 1 GPa, the $\textit{f}$ and $\textit{d}$ band centers of
N-doped LuH$_{3}$ show oscillation or even plateau, and the band gap of
insulators also shows a platform near this pressure, this is consistent with
the pressure range where room-temperature superconductivity appeared in Lu-N-H.
Our work provides insights into the understanding of Lu-N-H materials and other
hydrogen-rich superconductors based on the rare-earth elements.

The engineering of surface morphology and structure of the thin film is one
of the essential technological assets for regulating the physical properties
and functionalities of thin film-based devices. This study investigates the
evolution of surface structure and magnetic anisotropy in epitaxially grown
ultrathin Fe films on MgO (001) substrates subjected to multiple cycles of ion
beam erosion (IBE) after growth. Ultrathin Fe film grows in 3D island mode and
exhibits intrinsic fourfold magnetic anisotropy. After a few cycles of IBE, the
film displays an induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that leads to a split in
the hysteresis loop. In addition, clear and conclusive evidence of IBE mediated
(2x2) reconstruction of the Fe surface has been observed. We also demonstrate
that thermal annealing can reversibly tune the induced UMA and surface
reconstruction. The feasibility of the IBE technique by properly selecting ion
beam parameters for modification of surface structure has been highlighted
apart from conventional methods of tailoring the morphology for tuning of UMA.
Thus, the present work paves a way to explore the IBE-induced self-assembling
phenomena further.

Machine learning, deep learning, has been accelerating computational physics,
which has been used to simulate systems on a lattice. Equivariance is essential
to simulate a physical system because it imposes a strong inductive bias for
the probability distribution described by a machine learning model. However,
imposing symmetry on the model sometimes occur a poor acceptance rate in
self-learning Monte-Carlo (SLMC). We introduce symmetry equivariant attention
to SLMC, which can be systematically improvable. To evaluate our architecture,
we apply it to our proposed new architecture on a spin-fermion model (i.e.
double exchange model) on a two-dimensional lattice. We find that it overcomes
poor acceptance rates of linear models and observe similar scaling law as in
large language models, model quality monotonically increased as layers
increased.

<br>
We explore the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling in the one-dimensional
Hubbard model, which exhibits global $SU_c(2)\otimes SU_s(2)$ symmetry at
half-filling, for the pseudo-charge and the total spin. We analyze dynamical
scaling properties of high temperature charge and spin correlations and
transport. At half-filling, we observe a clear KPZ scaling in both charge and
spin sectors. Away from half-filling, the $SU_c(2)$ charge symmetry is reduced
to $U_c(1)$, while the $SU_s(2)$ symmetry for the total spin is retained.
Consequently, transport in the charge sector becomes ballistic, while KPZ
scaling is preserved in the spin sector. These findings confirm the link
between non-abelian symmetries and KPZ scaling in the presence of
integrability. We study two settings of the model: one involving a quench from
a bi-partitioned state asymptotically close to the $T=\infty$ equilibrium state
of the system, and another where the system is coupled to two markovian
reservoirs at the two edges of the chain.

Ilmenites $AB$O$_3$ provide a platform for electron correlation and magnetism
on alternatively stacked honeycomb layers of edge-sharing $A$O$_6$ or $B$O$_6$
octahedra. When $A$ and $B$ are $3d$ transition metals, strong electron
correlation makes the systems Mott insulators showing various magnetic
properties, while when $B$ is Ir with $5d$ electrons, competition between
electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling realizes a spin-orbital coupled
Mott insulator as a potential candidate for quantum spin liquids. Here we
theoretically investigate intermediate $4d$ ilmenites, $A$RuO$_3$ with $A$=Mg
and Cd, which were recently synthesized and shown to be metallic, unlike the
$3d$ and $5d$ cases. By using first-principles calculations, we optimize the
lattice structures and obtain the electronic band structures. We show that
MgRuO$_3$ exhibits strong dimerization on RuO$_6$ honeycomb layers, leading to
the formation of bonding and anti-bonding bands for one of three $t_{2g}$
orbitals; the lattice symmetry is lowered from $R\bar{3}$ to $P\bar{1}$, and
the Fermi surfaces are composed of the other two $t_{2g}$ orbitals. In
contrast, we find that CdRuO$_3$ has a lattice structure close to $R\bar{3}$,
and all three $t_{2g}$ orbitals contribute almost equally to the Fermi
surfaces. Comparison of our results with other Ru honeycomb materials such as
Li$_2$RuO$_3$ indicates that the metallic ruthenium ilmenites stand on a subtle
balance among electron correlation, spin-orbit coupling, and electron-phonon
coupling.

Circularly polarized lattice vibrations carry angular momentum and lead to
magnetic responses in applied magnetic fields or when resonantly driven with
ultrashort laser pulses. Recent measurements have found responses that are
orders of magnitude larger than those calculated in prior theoretical studies.
Here, we present a microscopic model for the effective magnetic moments of
chiral phonons in magnetic materials that is able to reproduce the
experimentally measured magnitudes and that allows us to make quantitative
predictions for materials with giant magnetic responses using microscopic
parameters. Our model is based on orbit-lattice couplings that hybridize
optical phonons with orbital electronic transitions. We apply our model to two
types of materials: $4f$ rare-earth halide paramagnets and $3d$
transition-metal oxide magnets. In both cases, we find that chiral phonons can
carry giant effective magnetic moments of the order of a Bohr magneton, orders
of magnitude larger than previous predictions.

We investigate classical Heisenberg models on the distorted windmill lattice
and discuss their applicability to the spin-$1/2$ spin liquid candidate
PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$. We first consider a general Heisenberg model on this lattice
with antiferromagnetic interactions $J_n$ ($n=1,2,3,4$) up to fourth neighbors.
Setting $J_1=J_2$ (as approximately realized in PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$) we map out the
classical ground state phase diagram in the remaining parameter space and
identify a competition between $J_3$ and $J_4$ that opens up interesting
magnetic scenarios. Particularly, these couplings tune the ground states from
coplanar commensurate or non-coplanar incommensurate magnetically ordered
states to highly degenerate ground state manifolds with subextensive or
extensive degeneracies. In the latter case, we uncover an unusual classical
spin liquid defined on a lattice of corner sharing octahedra. We then focus on
the particular set of interaction parameters $J_n$ that has previously been
proposed for PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ and investigate the system's incommensurate
magnetic ground state order and finite temperature multistage ordering
mechanism. We perform extensive finite temperature simulations of the system's
dynamical spin structure factor and compare it with published neutron
scattering data for PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ at low temperatures. Our results
demonstrate that thermal fluctuations in the classical model can largely
explain the signal distribution in the measured spin structure factor but we
also identify distinct differences. Our investigations make use of a variety of
different analytical and numerical approaches for classical spin systems, such
as Luttinger-Tisza, classical Monte Carlo, iterative minimization, and
molecular dynamics simulations.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) are a promising technique for
atomic modeling. While high accuracy and small errors are widely reported for
MLPs, an open concern is whether MLPs can accurately reproduce atomistic
dynamics and related physical properties in their applications in molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. In this study, we examine the current
state-of-the-art MLPs and uncover a number of discrepancies related to atom
dynamics, defects, and rare events (REs), in their MD simulations compared to
ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that low averaged errors by current MLP
testing are insufficient, leading us to develop novel quantitative metrics that
better indicate the accurate prediction of related properties by MLPs in MD
simulations. The MLPs optimized by the RE-based evaluation metrics are
demonstrated to have improved prediction in multiple properties. The identified
errors, the developed evaluation metrics, and the proposed process of
developing such metrics are general to MLPs, thus providing valuable guidance
for future testing, development, and improvements of accurate, robust, and
reliable MLPs for atomistic modeling.

<h3>Decay of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids</h3>

We investigate the role of vortices in the decay of persistent current states
of annular atomic superfluids by solving numerically the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, and we directly compare our results with experimental data from Ref.
[1]. We theoretically model the optical phase-imprinting technique employed to
experimentally excite finite-circulation states in Ref. [1] in the
Bose-Einstein condensation regime, accounting for imperfections of the optical
gradient imprinting profile. By comparing simulations of this realistic
protocol to an ideal imprinting, we show that the introduced density
excitations arising from imperfect imprinting are mainly responsible for
limiting the maximum reachable winding number $w_\mathrm{max}$ in the
superfluid ring. We also investigate the effect of a point-like obstacle with
variable potential height $V_0$ onto the decay of circulating supercurrents.
For a given obstacle height, a critical circulation $w_c$ exists, such that for
an initial circulation $w_0$ larger than $w_c$ the supercurrent decays through
the emission of vortices, which cross the superflow and thus induce phase
slippage. Higher values of the obstacle height $V_0$ further favour the
entrance of vortices, thus leading to lower values of $w_c$. Furthermore, the
stronger vortex-defect interaction at higher $V_0$ leads to vortices that
propagate closer to the center of the ring condensate. The combination of both
these effects leads to an increase of the supercurrent decay rate for
increasing $w_0$, in agreement with experimental observations.

The study of topological quantum materials for enhanced thermoelectric energy
conversion has received significant attention recently. Topological materials
(including topological insulators and Dirac/Weyl/nodal-line semi-metals) with
unique nature of band structure involving linear and regular parabolic bands
near Fermi level (E$_F$) have the potential to show promising TE properties. In
this article, we report the promising TE performance of a quaternary
chalcogenide (Cu$_2$ZnGeTe$_4$) having non-trivial topological phase. At
ambient condition, the compound is a narrow band gap (0.067 eV) semiconductor,
with a TE figure of merit (ZT) 1.2. Application of 5% strain drives the system
to a topologically non-trivial Weyl semi-metal with the right combination of
linear and parabolic bands near E$_F$, giving rise to a reasonable ZT of 0.36.
Apart from strain, alloy engineering (Sn substituted at Ge) is also shown to
induce topological non-triviality. The present work demonstrates the potential
of such unique semimetals for exceptional electronic transport properties and
hence excellent thermoelectric performance.

<h3>Formation energies of silicon self-interstitials using periodic coupled  cluster theory</h3>

We present a study of the self-interstitial point defect formation energies
in silicon using a range of quantum chemical theories including the coupled
cluster (CC) method within a periodic supercell approach. We study the
formation energies of the X, T, H and C3V self-interstitials and the vacancy V.
Our results are compared to findings obtained using different ab initio methods
published in the literature and partly to experimental data. In order to
achieve computational results that are converged with respect to system size
and basis set, we employ the recently proposed finite size error corrections
and basis set incompleteness error corrections. Our CCSD(T) calculations yield
an order of stability of the X, H and T self-interstitials, which agrees both
with quantum Monte Carlo results and with predictions obtained using the
random-phase approximation as well as using screened hybrid functionals.
Compared to quantum Monte Carlo results with backflow corrections, the CCSD(T)
formation energies of X and H are only slightly larger by about 100 meV.
However, in the case of the T self-interstitial, we find significant
disagreement with all other theoretical predictions. Compared to quantum Monte
Carlo calculations, CCSD(T) overestimates the formation energy of the T
self-interstitial by 1.2 eV. Although this can partly be attributed to strong
correlation effects, more accurate electronic structure theories are needed to
understand these findings.

<h3>Critical percolation in the ordering kinetics of twisted nematic phases</h3>

<i>Renan A. L. Almeida</i>

I report on the experimental confirmation that critical percolation
statistics underlie the ordering kinetics of twisted nematic phases in the
Allen-Cahn universality class. Soon after the ordering starts from a
homogeneous disordered phase and proceeds towards a broken
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry phase, the system is attracted to the random
percolation fixed point at a special timescale $t_{p}$. At this time, exact
formulae for conformally invariant crossing probabilities in percolation theory
agree with the corresponding probabilities in the experimental data. The
ensuing evolution for the number density of hull-enclosed areas is described by
an exact expression derived from a percolation model endowed with
curvature-driven interface motion. Scaling relation for hull-enclosed areas
versus perimeters reveals that the fractal percolation geometry is
progressively morphed into a regular geometry up to the order of the classical
coarsening length.

Probing the superconducting order parameter symmetry is a crucial step
towards understanding the pairing mechanism in unconventional superconductors.
Inspired by the recent discoveries of superconductivity in various van der
Waals materials, and the availability of the relative twist angle as a
continuous tuning knob in these systems, we propose a general setup for probing
the order parameter symmetry of two-dimensional superconductors in twisted
Josephson junctions. The junction is composed of an anisotropic s-wave
superconductor as a probe and another superconductor with an unknown order
parameter symmetry. Assuming momentum-resolved tunneling, we investigate
signatures of different order parameter symmetries in the twist angle
dependence of the critical current, the current-phase relations, and magnetic
field dependence. As a concrete example, we study a twisted Josephson junction
between NbSe2 and magic angle twisted bilayer graphene.

Lack of rigorous reproducibility and validation are major hurdles for
scientific development across many fields. Materials science in particular
encompasses a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches that require
careful benchmarking. Leaderboard efforts have been developed previously to
mitigate these issues. However, a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking on
an integrated platform with multiple data modalities with both perfect and
defect materials data is still lacking. This work introduces
JARVIS-Leaderboard, an open-source and community-driven platform that
facilitates benchmarking and enhances reproducibility. The platform allows
users to set up benchmarks with custom tasks and enables contributions in the
form of dataset, code, and meta-data submissions. We cover the following
materials design categories: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electronic Structure
(ES), Force-fields (FF), Quantum Computation (QC) and Experiments (EXP). For
AI, we cover several types of input data, including atomic structures,
atomistic images, spectra, and text. For ES, we consider multiple ES
approaches, software packages, pseudopotentials, materials, and properties,
comparing results to experiment. For FF, we compare multiple approaches for
material property predictions. For QC, we benchmark Hamiltonian simulations
using various quantum algorithms and circuits. Finally, for experiments, we use
the inter-laboratory approach to establish benchmarks. There are 1281
contributions to 274 benchmarks using 152 methods with more than 8 million
data-points, and the leaderboard is continuously expanding. The

<h3>Statistics of noninteracting many-body fermionic states: The question of  a many-body mobility edge</h3>

<br>

In this work, we study the statistics of a generic noninteracting many-body
fermionic system whose single-particle counterpart has a single-particle
mobility edge (SPME). We first prove that the spectrum and the extensive
conserved quantities follow the multivariate normal distribution with a
vanishing standard deviation $\sim O(1/\sqrt L)$ in the thermodynamic limit,
regardless of SPME. Consequently, the theorem rules out an infinite-temperature
or high-temperature many-body mobility edge (MBME) for generic noninteracting
fermionic systems. Further, we also prove that the spectrum of a fermionic
many-body system with short-range interactions is qualitatively similar to that
of a noninteracting many-body system up to the third-order moment. These
results partially explain why neither short-range [1] nor long-range
interacting systems exhibit an infinite-temperature MBME.

<h3>Unusual ergodic and chaotic properties of trapped hard rods</h3>

<br>

We investigate ergodicity, chaos and thermalization for a one-dimensional
classical gas of hard rods confined to an external quadratic or quartic trap,
which breaks microscopic integrability. To quantify the strength of chaos in
this system, we compute its maximal Lyapunov exponent numerically. The approach
to thermal equilibrium is studied by considering the time evolution of particle
position and velocity distributions and comparing the late-time profiles with
the Gibbs state. Remarkably, we find that quadratically trapped hard rods are
highly non-ergodic and do not resemble a Gibbs state even at extremely long
times, despite compelling evidence of chaos for four or more rods. On the other
hand, our numerical results reveal that hard rods in a quartic trap exhibit
both chaos and thermalization, and equilibrate to a Gibbs state as expected for
a nonintegrable many-body system.

<br>
<br>
The van der Waals (vdW) type-II multiferroic NiI$_2$ has emerged as a
candidate for exploring non-collinear magnetism and magnetoelectric effects in
the 2D limit. Frustrated intralayer exchange interactions on a triangular
lattice result in a helimagnetic ground state, with spin-induced improper
ferroelectricity stabilized by the interlayer interactions. Here we investigate
the magnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk NiI$_2$, using
high-pressure Raman spectroscopy, optical linear dichroism, and x-ray
diffraction. We obtain evidence for a significant pressure enhancement of the
antiferromagnetic and helimagnetic transition temperatures, at rates of
$\sim15.3/14.4$ K/GPa, respectively. These enhancements are attributed to a
cooperative effect of pressure-enhanced interlayer and third-nearest-neighbor
intralayer exchange. These results reveal a general path for obtaining
high-temperature type-II multiferroicity via high pressures in vdW materials.

<h3>Reconstructing the spatial structure of quantum correlations</h3>

Quantum correlations are a fundamental property of quantum many-body states.
Yet they remain experimentally elusive, hindering certification of genuine
quantum behavior, especially in quantum materials. Here we show that the
momentum-dependent dynamical susceptibility measured via inelastic neutron
scattering enables the systematic reconstruction of quantum correlation
functions, which express the degree of quantum coherence in the fluctuations of
two spins at arbitrary mutual distance. Using neutron scattering data on the
compound KCuF$_3$ $\unicode{x2014}$ a system of weakly coupled $S=1/2$
Heisenberg chains $\unicode{x2014}$ and of numerically exact quantum Monte
Carlo data, we show that quantum correlations possess a radically different
spatial structure with respect to conventional correlations. Indeed, they
exhibit a new emergent length of quantum-mechanical origin $\unicode{x2014}$
the quantum coherence length $\unicode{x2014}$ which is finite at any finite
temperature (including when long-range magnetic order develops). Moreover, we
show theoretically that coupled Heisenberg spin chains exhibit a form of
quantum monogamy, with a trade-off between quantum correlations along and
transverse to the spin chains. These results highlight real-space quantum
correlators as an informative, model-independent means of probing the
underlying quantum state of real quantum materials.
