<h3>Majorana corner states in the dice lattice</h3>

Lattice geometry continues providing exotic new topological phases in
condensed matter physics. Exciting recent examples are the higher-order
topological phases, manifesting via localized lower-dimensional boundary
states. Moreover, flat electronic bands with a non-trivial topology arise in
various lattices and can hold a finite superfluid density, bounded by the Chern
number $C$. Here we provide a general route to analyze the topological
properties of flat bands in the superconducting state. We argue that the
topological superconductivity induced in a flat band with $C=n$ is of order $n$
and the associated boundary Majorana states have a complex structure when
$n>1$. As example, we show that an attractive interaction in the dice lattice,
that exhibits flat bands with $C=2$, gives rise to second-order topological
superconductivity with mixed singlet-triplet pairing. The second-order nature
of the topological superconducting phase is revealed by the zero-energy
Majorana bound states at the lattice corners. These findings suggest that flat
bands with a finite Chern number provide feasible platforms for inducing
topological superconductivity of various orders.

We present nonlinear dynamic equations for nematic and smectic $A$ liquid
crystals in the presence of an alternating electric field and explain their
derivation in detail. The local electric field acting in any liquid-crystalline
system is expressed as a sum of external electric field and the fields
originating from feedback of liquid crystal order parameter, and a field,
created by charged impurities. The system tends to decrease the total electric
field, because it lowers the energy density. This basically nonlinear problem
is not a pure academic interest. In the realm of liquid crystals and their
applications, utilized nowadays modern experimental techniques have progressed
to the point where even small deviations from the linear behavior can be
observed and measured with a high accuracy. Hydrodynamics is the macroscopic
description of condensed matter systems in the low frequency, long wavelength
limit. Nonlinear hydrodynamic equations are well established to describe simple
fluids. Similar approaches (with degrees of freedom related to the broken
orientational or translational symmetry included) have been used also for
liquid crystals. However to study behavior of strongly perturbed well above the
thresholds of various electro-hydrodynamic instabilities of liquid crystals the
nonlinear equations should include soft electromagnetic degrees of freedom as
well. The self-consistent derivation of the complete set of the nonlinear
electro-hydrodynamic equations for liquid crystals became an actual task. The
aim of our work is to present these equations, which is a mandatory step to
handle any nonlinear phenomenon in liquid crystals.

<h3>Configuration interaction based nonequilibrium steady state impurity  solver</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09623</a>
<br>
<i>D. Werner, J. Lotze, E. Arrigoni</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a solver for correlated impurity problems out of equilibrium based
on a combination of the so-called auxiliary master equation approach (AMEA) and
the configuration interaction expansion. Within AMEA one maps the original
impurity model onto an auxiliary open quantum system with a restricted number
of bath sites which can be addressed by numerical many-body approaches such as
Lanczos/Arnoldi exact diagonalization (ED) or matrix product states (MPS).
While the mapping becomes exponentially more accurate with increasing number of
bath sites, ED implementations are severely limited due to the fast increase of
the Hilbert space dimension for open systems, and the MPS solver typically
requires rather long runtimes. Here, we propose to adopt a configuration
interaction approach augmented by active space extension to solve numerically
the correlated auxiliary open quantum system. This allows access to a larger
number of bath sites at lower computational costs than for plain ED. We
benchmark the approach with numerical renormalization group results in
equilibrium and with MPS out of equilibrium. In particular, we evaluate the
current, the conductance as well as the Kondo peak and its splitting as a
function of increasing bias voltage below the Kondo temperature TK. We obtain a
rather accurate scaling of the conductance as a function of the bias voltage
and temperature rescaled by TK for moderate to strong interactions in a wide
range of parameters. The approach combines the fast runtime of ED with an
accuracy close to the one achieved by MPS making it an attractive solver for
nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory.

<h3>The Voronoi pair correlation function</h3>

The pair correlation function (PCF) has proven an effective tool for
analyzing many physical systems due to its simplicity and its applicability to
simulated and experimental data. However, as an averaged quantity, the PCF can
fail to capture subtle structural differences in particle arrangements, even
when those differences can have a major impact on system properties. Here, we
use Voronoi topology to introduce a discrete version of the PCF that highlights
local inter-particle topological configurations. The advantages of the Voronoi
PCF are demonstrated in several examples including crystalline, hyper-uniform,
and active matter systems showing clustering and giant number fluctuations.

<h3>First and second sound in two-dimensional bosonic and fermionic  superfluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09733" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09733</a>
<br>
<i>L. Salasnich, A. Cappellaro, K. Furutani, A. Tononi, G. Bighin</i>
<br>
<br>
We review our theoretical results about the sound propagation in
two-dimensional (2D) systems of ultracold fermionic and bosonic atoms. In the
superfluid phase, characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the
$U(1)$ symmetry, there is the coexistence of first and second sound. In the
case of weakly-interacting repulsive bosons, we model the recent measurements
of the sound velocities of 39K atoms in 2D obtained in the weakly-interacting
regime and around the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
superfluid-to-normal transition temperature. In particular, we perform a quite
accurate computation of the superfluid density and show that it is reasonably
consistent with the experiment. For superfluid attractive fermions, we
calculate the first and second sound velocities across the whole BCS-BEC
crossover. In the low-temperature regime we reproduce the recent measurements
of first-sound speed with 6Li atoms. We also predict that only in the
finite-temperature BEC regime there is mixing between sound modes.

<h3>Emergence of hydrodynamic spatial long-range correlations in  nonequilibrium many-body systems</h3>

At large scales of space and time, the nonequilibrium dynamics of local
observables in extensive many-body systems is extremely well described by
hydrodynamics. At the Euler scale, it is typically assumed that each mesoscopic
region of the system independently reaches a state of maximal entropy under the
constraints given by the available conservation laws: locally, in each "fluid
cell", one finds a Gibbs or generalised Gibbs state. Away from phase
transitions maximal entropy states show exponential correlation decay, and
independence of fluid cells might be assumed to subsist during the course of
time evolution. In this manuscript, we show that this picture is incorrect:
regions separated by macroscopic distances develop long-range correlations as
time passes. We provide a universal theoretical framework to exactly evaluate
these correlations, an adaptation of the macroscopic fluctuation theory to the
Euler scale. We verify our exact predictions in a paradigmatic interacting
model of many-body physics, the hard-rod gas, by comparing with numerical
simulations and finding excellent agreement.

<h3>Superconducting proximity effect and long-ranged triplets in dirty  metallic antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09325</a>
<br>
<i>Eirik Holm Fyhn, Arne Brataas, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Jacob Linder</i>

<br>
Antiferromagnets have no net spin-splitting on the scale of the
superconducting coherence length. Despite this, antiferromagnets has been
observed to suppress superconductivity in a similar way as ferromagnets, a
phenomenon which still lacks a clear understanding. We find that this effect
can be explained by the role of impurities in antiferromagnets. Using
quasiclassical Green's functions, we study the proximity effect and critical
temperature in diffusive superconductor-metallic antiferromagnet bilayers. The
non-magnetic impurities acquire an effective magnetic component in the
antiferromagnet. This not only reduces the critical temperature, but also
separates the superconducting correlations into short-ranged and long-ranged
components, similar to ferromagnetic proximity systems.

<h3>Pseudo-spin order of Wigner crystals in multi-valley electron gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09326" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09326</a>
<br>
<i>Vladimir Calvera, Steven A. Kivelson, Erez Berg</i>
<br>
<br>
We study multi-valley electron gases in the low density ($r_s \gg 1$) limit.
Here the ground-state is always a Wigner crystal (WC), with additional
pseudo-spin order where the pseudo-spins are related to valley occupancies.
Depending on the symmetries of the host semiconductor and the values of the
parameters such as the anisotropy of the effective mass tensors, we find a
striped or chiral pseudo-spin antiferromagnet, or a time-reversal symmetry
breaking orbital loop-current ordered pseudo-spin ferromagnet. Our theory
applies to the recently-discovered WC states in AlAs and in mono and bilayer
transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify a set of interesting electronic
liquid crystalline phases that could arise by continuous quantum melting of
such WCs.

<h3>Equilibrium supercurrent in proximity-induced superconductors due to  band asymmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09346" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09346</a>
<br>
<i>Pavan Hosur, Daniel Palacios</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the consequences of proximity-induced
conventional superconductivity in metals that break time-reversal and inversion
symmetries through their energy dispersion but may not harbor Berry phases in
their bands. We discover behaviors impossible in an isolated superconductor,
such as an equilibrium supercurrent that apparently violates Bloch's theorem
and, at suitable topological defects, non-conservation of electric charge
reminiscent of the chiral anomaly. We distinguish two cases, type-A and type-B,
respectively, based on whether band asymmetry and equilibrium supercurrent
onset at different temperatures or the same temperature, and sketch their
Landau phase diagrams. For both types, the equilibrium supercurrent can be
trained by a helical electromagnetic field.

<h3>Thermal critical points from competing singlet formations in fully  frustrated bilayer antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Lukas Weber, Antoine Yves Dimitri Fache, Frédéric Mila, Stefan Wessel</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the ground-state phase diagram and thermal phase transitions in a
plaquettized fully frustrated bilayer spin-1/2 Heisenberg model. Based on a
combined analysis from sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulations,
perturbation theory and free-energy arguments, we identify a first-order
quantum phase transition line that separates two competing quantum-disordered
ground states with dominant singlet formations on inter-layer dimers and
plaquettes, respectively. At finite temperatures, this line extends to form a
wall of first-order thermal transitions, which terminates in a line of thermal
critical points. From a perturbative approach in terms of an effective Ising
model description, we identify a quadratic suppression of the critical
temperature scale in the strongly plaquettized region. Based on free-energy
arguments we furthermore obtain the full phase boundary of the low-temperature
dimer-singlet regime, which agrees well with the quantum Monte Carlo data.

<h3>Multiscale modeling of resistive switching in gold nanogranular films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09379</a>
<br>
<i>Miquel López-Suárez, Claudio Melis, Luciano Colombo, Walter Tarantino</i>
<br>
<br>
Metallic nanogranular films display a complex dynamical response to a
constant bias, showing up as atypical resistive switching mechanism which could
be used to create electrical components for neuromorphic applications. To model
such a phenomenon we use a multiscale approach blending together an ab initio
treatment of the electric current at the nanoscale, a molecular dynamical
approach dictating structural rearrangements, and a finite-element solution of
the heat equation for heat propagation in the sample. We also consider
structural changes due to electromigration which are modelled on the basis of
experimental observations on similar systems. Within such an approach, we
manage to describe some distinctive features of the resistive switching
occurring in nanogranular film and provide a physical interpretation at the
microscopic level.

<h3>Random Ising chain in transverse and longitudinal fields: Strong  disorder RG study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09380" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09380</a>
<br>
<i>Tamás Pető, Ferenc Iglói, István A. Kovács</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the compound ${\rm LiHo}_x{\rm Y}_{1-x}{\rm F}_4$ we consider
the Ising chain with random couplings and in the presence of simultaneous
random transverse and longitudinal fields, and study its low-energy properties
at zero temperature by the strong disorder renormalization group approach. In
the absence of longitudinal fields, the system exhibits a quantum-ordered and a
quantum-disordered phase separated by a critical point of infinite disorder.
When the longitudinal random field is switched on, the ordered phase vanishes
and the trajectories of the renormalization group are attracted to two
disordered fixed points: one is characteristic of the classical random field
Ising chain, the other describes the quantum disordered phase. The two
disordered phases are separated by a separatrix that starts at the infinite
disorder fixed point and near which there are strong quantum fluctuations.

<h3>Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the square lattice Hubbard model: A  truncated-unity functional renormalization group study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09384" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09384</a>
<br>
<i>Jacob Beyer, Jonas Hauck, Lennart Klebl, Tilman Schwemmer, Dante M. Kennes, Ronny Thomale, Carsten Honerkamp, Stephan Rachel</i>
<br>
<br>
The Rashba-Hubbard model on the square lattice is the paradigmatic case for
studying the effect of spin-orbit coupling, which breaks spin and inversion
symmetry, in a correlated electron system. We employ a truncated-unity variant
of the functional renormalization group which allows us to analyze magnetic and
superconducting instabilities on equal footing. We derive phase diagrams
depending on the strengths of Rasbha spin-orbit coupling, real second-neighbor
hopping and electron filling. We find commensurate and incommensurate magnetic
phases which compete with d-wave superconductivity. Due to the breaking of
inversion symmetry, singlet and triplet components mix; we quantify the mixing
of d-wave singlet pairing with f-wave triplet pairing.

<h3>Wave transmission and its universal fluctuations in one-dimensional  systems with Lévy-like disorder: Schrödinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac  equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09388" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09388</a>
<br>
<i>Anderson L. R. Barbosa, Jonas R. F. Lima, Luiz Felipe C. Pereira</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the propagation of waves in one-dimensional systems with
L\'evy-type disorder. We perform a complete analysis of non-relativistic and
relativistic wave transmission submitted to potential barriers whose width,
separation or both follow L\'evy distributions characterized by an exponent $0
< \alpha <1$. For the first two cases, where one of the parameters is fixed,
non-relativistic and relativistic waves present anomalous localization,
$\langle T \rangle \propto L^{-\alpha}$. However, for the latter case, in which
both parameters follow a L\'evy distribution, non-relativistic and relativistic
waves present a transition between anomalous and standard localization as the
incidence energy increases relative to the barrier height. Moreover, we obtain
the localization diagram delimiting anomalous and standard localization
regimes, in terms of incidence angle and energy. Finally, we verify that
transmission fluctuations, characterized by its standard deviation, are
universal, independent of barrier architecture, wave equation type, incidence
energy and angle, further extending earlier studies on electronic localization.

<h3>Spin Hall angle in single-layer graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Juliana M. da Silva, Fernando A. F. Santana, Jorge G. G. S. Ramos, Anderson L. R. Barbosa</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the spin Hall effect in a single-layer graphene device with
disorder and interface-induced spin-orbit coupling. Our graphene device is
connected to four semi-infinite leads that are embedded in a
{Landauer-B\"uttiker} setup for quantum transport. We show that the spin Hall
angle of graphene devices exhibits mesoscopic fluctuations that are similar to
metal devices. Furthermore, the product between the {maximum spin Hall angle
deviation} and dimensionless longitudinal conductivity follows a universal
relationship $\Theta_{sH} \times \sigma = 0.18$. Finally, we compare the
universal relation with recent experimental data and numerically exact
real-space simulations from the tight-binding model.

<h3>Excitation and Relaxation of Nonthermal Electron Energy Distributions in  Metals with Application to Gold</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09422" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09422</a>
<br>
<i>D. M. Riffe, Richard B. Wilson</i>
<br>
<br>
A semiempirical theory for the excitation and subsequent relaxation of
nonthermal electrons is described. The theory, which is applicable to
ultrafast-laser excited metals, is based on the Boltzmann transport equation
and includes electron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-photon scattering
integrals in forms that explicitly depend on the electronic density of states.
Electron-phonon coupling is treated by extending the theory of Allen [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 59, 1460 (1987)] to include highly-excited nonthermal electron
distributions, and is used to determine the energy transfer rate between a
nonthermal electron subsystem and a thermal phonon subsystem. Electron-electron
scattering is treated with a simple energy-conserving electron-electron
scattering integral. The electron-photon integral assumes photon absorption is
phonon assisted. Using the theory we numerically (with support from analytic
calculations) study the evolution of instantaneously excited carrier
distributions, from which we derive timescales for relaxation of the
high-energy part of the distribution, energy transfer (to the phonon
subsystem), and intracarrier thermalization. All three timescales are
extensively characterized as functions of the (photon-energy normalized) ratio
of electron-phonon to electron-electron scattering strengths. The effects of
lattice temperature and excited electron density are also investigated. We
apply the theory to analyze prior ultrafast thermionic emission, two-color
photoemission, and electronic Raman scattering experiments on Au.

Grand Canonical Monte Carlo is an important method for performing
molecular-level simulations and assisting the study and development of
nanoporous materials for gas capture application. These simulations are based
on the use of force fields and partial charges to model the interaction between
the adsorbent molecules and the solid framework. The choice of the force field
parameters and partial charges can significantly impact the results obtained,
however, there are very few databases available to support a comprehensive
impact evaluation. Here, we present a database of simulations of CO2 and N2
adsorption isotherms on 726 metal-organic frameworks taken from the CoRE MOF
2014 database. We performed simulations with two force fields (UFF and
DREIDING), four partial charge schemes (no charge, Qeq, EQeq, and DDEC), and
three temperatures (273, 298, 323 K). The resulting isotherms compose the
Charge-dependent, Reproducible, Accessible, Forcefield-dependent, and
Temperature-dependent Exploratory Database (CRAFTED) of adsorption isotherms.

Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) has
recently gained widespread attention for its ability to image atomic electric
fields with sub-{\AA}ngstrom spatial resolution. These electric field maps
represent the integrated effect of the nucleus, core electrons and valence
electrons, and separating their contributions is non-trivial. In this paper, we
utilized simultaneously acquired 4D-STEM center of mass (CoM) images and
annular dark field (ADF) images to determine the electron charge density in
monolayer MoS2. We find that both the core electrons and the valence electrons
contribute to the derived electron charge density. However, due to blurring by
the probe shape, the valence electron contribution forms a nearly featureless
background while most of the spatial modulation comes from the core electrons.
Our findings highlight the importance of probe shape in interpreting charge
densities derived from 4D STEM.

<h3>Hyperuniformity in Type-II Superconductors with Point and Planar Defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09488" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09488</a>

<i>Joaquín Puig, Jazmín Aragón Sánchez, Gladys Nieva, Alejandro B. Kolton, Yanina Fasano</i>
<br>
<br>
We use vortex matter in type-II superconductors as a playground to study how
different types of disorder affect the long wavelength density fluctuations of
the system. We find that irrespective of the vortex-vortex interaction, in the
case of samples with weak and dense point defects the system presents the
hidden order of hyperuniformity characterized by an algebraic suppression of
density fluctuations when increasing the system size. We also reveal that, on
the contrary, for samples with planar defects hyperuniformity is suppressed
since density fluctuations have a tendency to unboundedness on increasing the
system size. Although some of these results were known from previous works,
this paper makes the fundamental discovery that the ability of planar disorder
to suppress hyperuniformity grows on increasing the softness of the structure
for more diluted systems.

<h3>Dynamical cooperation model for mitigating the segregation phase in  Schelling's model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09490</a>

<br>
<br>
We consider a Schelling-like segregation model, in which the behavior of
individual agents is determined by a mixed individual and global utility. With
a high ratio of global utility being incorporated, the agents are cooperative
in order to realize a homogenized state, otherwise the agents are less
cooperative, leading to an undesired Nash equilibrium with low utility. In the
present study, we introduce a dynamically varying cooperation degree parameter
to prevent the agents from falling into such a low-utility equilibrium state.
More precisely, a large cooperation degree is assigned when the agents are in
high-utility regions, whereas agents having low utility behave more
individually. Simulation results show that homogenized phases with globally
high utility are achieved with the present dynamical control, even for the case
of a low mean value of cooperation degree. Since the cooperation degree
represents the magnitude with which Pigouvian tax is enforced in the model of
residential movement within a city, this result suggests the possibility of tax
intervention to circumvent the undesired segregation of residents.

We clarify that an ideal gas obeying infinite statistics cannot undergo
condensation. Then we derive the dynamic equation for an identical particle
system obeying infinite statistics under external potential and inter-particle
interaction. The derivation utilizes the Hamiltonian written in terms of the
number operators and the transition number operators. At a very low
temperature, where one can discard the dynamics of the excited occupation
level, the dynamic of an infinite statistics system can be described by the
Gross Pitaevskii equation, similar to the Bose-Einstein case.

Both cuprates and iron-based superconductors demonstrate nematicity, defined
as the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in electron systems. The
nematic state can play a role in the high-transition-temperature
superconductivity of these compounds. However, the microscopic mechanism
responsible for the transport anisotropy in iron-based compounds remains
debatable. Here, we investigate the electronic anisotropy of CaFeAsF by
measuring its interlayer resistivity under magnetic fields with varying field
directions. Counterintuitively, the interlayer resistivity was larger in the
longitudinal configuration ($B \parallel I \parallel c$) than in the transverse
one ($B \perp I \parallel c$). The interlayer resistivity exhibited a so-called
coherence peak under in-plane fields and was highly anisotropic with respect to
the in-plane field direction. At $T$ = 4 K and $B$ = 14 T, the
magnetoresistance $\Delta\rho/\rho_0$ was seven times larger in the $B
\parallel b_o$ than in the $B \parallel a_o$ configuration. Our theoretical
calculations of the conductivity based on the first-principles electronic band
structure qualitatively reproduced the above observations but underestimated
the magnitudes of the observed features. The proposed methodology can be a
powerful tool for probing the nematic electronic state in various materials.

<br>
The intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) axion insulators and Weyl semimetals (WSMs)
with only single pair of Weyl points have drawn intensive attention but so far
remain rare and elusive in real materials. Here, we propose a new class of
Mn\emph{X}$_{2}$\emph{B}$_{2}$\emph{T}$_{6}$-B (\emph{X}=Ge, Sn, or Pb;
\emph{B}=Sb or Bi; \emph{T}=Se or Te) family that is the stable structural form
of this system. We find that the Mn\emph{X}$_{2}$\emph{B}$_{2}$\emph{T}$_{6}$-B
family has not only the intrinsic FM axion insulators
MnGe$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$Te$_{6}$-B, MnSn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$Te$_{6}$-B, and
MnPb$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$Te$_{6}$-B, but also the intrinsic WSM
MnSn$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{6}$-B with only a single pair of Weyl points. Thus, the
Mn\emph{X}$_{2}$\emph{B}$_{2}$\emph{T}$_{6}$-B family can provide an ideal
platform to explore the exotic topological magnetoelectric effect and the
intrinsic properties related to Weyl points.

<br>
Non-collinear spin order that breaks space inversion symmetry and allows
efficient electric-field control of magnetism makes BiFeO$_3$ a promising
candidate for applications in low-power spintronic devices. Epitaxial strain
effects have been intensively studied and exhibit significant modulation of the
magnetic order in BiFeO$_3$, but tuning its spin structure with continuously
varied uniaxial strain is still lacking up to date. Here, we apply \emph{in
situ} uniaxial strain to a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film and use scanning NV
microscope to image the nanoscale magnetic order in real-space. The strain is
continuously increased from 0\% to 1.5\% and four images under different
strains are acquired during this period. The images show that the spin cycloid
tilts by $\sim 12.6^\circ$ when strain approaches 1.5\%. A first principle
calculation has been processed to show that the tilting is energetically
favorable under such strain. Our \emph{in situ} strain applying method in
combination with scanning NV microscope real-space imaging ability paves a new
way in studying the coupling between magnetic order and strain in BiFeO$_3$
films.

The spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ shows spontaneous time-reversal
symmetry breaking and multiple superconducting phases in some crystals,
implying chiral superconductivity. Here we microscopically image the local
magnetic fields and magnetic susceptibility near the surface of UTe$_2$,
observing a homogeneous superfluid density $n_s$ and homogeneous pinned
vortices. The temperature dependence of $n_s$ is consistent with an anisotropic
gap and shows no evidence for an additional kink that would be expected at any
second phase transition. Our findings are consistent with a dominant $B_{3u}$
superconducting order parameter in the case of a quasi-2D Fermi surface and
provide no evidence for multiple phase transitions in $n_s(T)$ in UTe$_2$.

Realization of novel functionalities by tuning magnetic interactions in rare
earth perovskite oxide thin films opens up exciting technological prospects.
Strain-induced tuning of magnetic interactions in rare earth cobaltates and
nickelates is of central importance due to their versatility in electronic
transport properties. Here we reported the spin re-orientation induced
switching of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and its tunability with strain
in epitaxial LaCo$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$O$_{3}$ thin films across the ferromagnetic
transition. Moreover, with strain tuning, we could observe a two-fold to
four-fold symmetry crossover in AMR across the magnetic transition temperature.
The magnetization measurements revealed an onset of ferromagnetic transition
around 50 K, and a further reduction in temperature showed a subtle change in
the magnetization dynamics which reduces the ferromagnetic long-range ordering
and introduces glassiness in the system. The mechanism of field reversal was
studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, which revealed a
substantial amount of charge transfer from Ni to Co ions due to the presence of
Ni$^{2+}$ and Co$^{4+}$ ions. Strain effects in thin films have shown an
increase in negative magnetoresistance compared to their bulk counterpart,
which can be attributed to strain induced enhancement of ferromagnetism. Our
work demonstrated the tunability of magnetic interactions mediated electronic
transport in cobaltate and nickelate thin films, which is relevant in
understanding Ni-Co interactions in oxides for their technological applications
such as in AMR sensors.

Understanding the behaviour of vortices under nanoscale confinement in
superconducting circuits is of importance for development of superconducting
electronics and quantum technologies. Using numerical simulations based on the
Ginzburg-Landau theory for non-homogeneous superconductivity in the presence of
magnetic fields, we detail how lateral confinement organises vortices in a long
superconducting nanostripe, and present a phase diagram of vortex
configurations as a function of the stripe width and magnetic field. We discuss
why average vortex density is reduced and reveal that confinement also has
profound influence on vortex dynamics in the dissipative regime under sourced
electrical current, mapping out transitions between asynchronous and
synchronous vortex rows crossing the nanostripe as the current is varied.
Synchronous crossings are of particular interest, since they cause single-mode
modulations in the voltage drop along the stripe in a high (typically
GHz-to-THz) frequency range.

<h3>The strain gradient elasticity via nonlocal considerations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Strain gradient elasticity and nonlocal elasticity are two enhanced elastic
theories intensively used over the last fifty years to explain static and
dynamic phenomena that classical elasticity fails to do. The nonlocal elastic
theory has a clear differentiation from the classical case by considering
stresses in a point of the continuum as an integral of all stresses defined in
the treated elastic body. On the other hand, strain gradient elasticity is
characterized as a non-classical theory because considers both potential and
kinetic energy densities as not only functions of strains and velocities,
respectively but also functions of their gradients. Although the two
considerations seem to be completely different from each other, it is a common
belief that strain gradient elasticity has a lot in common with nonlocal
elasticity. The goal of the present work is to derive all the strain gradient
elastic theories appearing so far in the literature via nonlocal definitions of
the potential and kinetic energy densities. Such a derivation demonstrates the
common roots of the two theories and explains the nature of the involved
intrinsic parameters in strain gradient elastic theories. For the sake of
simplicity and brevity, only one-dimensional wave propagation phenomena are
considered.

<h3>Analysis of the finite-size effect of the long-range Ising model under  Glauber dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
We considered a long-range Ising model under Glauber dynamics and calculated
the difference from the mean-field approximation in a finite-size system using
perturbation theory. To deal with the BBGKY hierarchy, we assumed that certain
types of extensive properties have a Gaussian distribution, which turned out to
be equivalent to the Kirkwood superposition approximation within the range of
first-order perturbation. After several calculations, ordinary differential
equations that describe the time development of a two-body correlation were
derived. This discussion is the generalization of our previous study which
developed a similar consideration on the infinite-range Ising model. The
results of the calculation fit those of the numerical simulations for the case
in which the decay of the interaction was sufficiently slow; however, they
exhibited different behaviors when the decay became rapid.

<h3>Intense γ-photon and high-energy electron production by neutron  irradiation: effect of nuclear excitation on transport of defects</h3>

<br>
<br>
Effects of neutron irradiation on materials are often interpreted in terms of
atomic recoils, initiated by neutron impacts and producing crystal lattice
defects. We find that, in addition, there is a remarkable two-step process,
strongly pronounced in heavy elements, involving the generation of energetic
{\gamma}-photons in non-elastic collisions of neutrons with atomic nuclei
followed by the production of high-energy electrons through the scattering of
{\gamma}-photons by the atomic electrons. This two-step scattering creates a
non-equilibrium steady-state population of high-energy electrons in the bulk of
the material, which bombard atoms and stimulate vacancy diffusion, resulting in
a variety of driven athermal microstructural reactions including the enhanced
recombination of radiation defects. We find that tungsten converts the energy
of fusion or fission neutrons into a flux of {\gamma}-radiation and
subsequently high-energy electrons with the conversion efficiency approaching
99%, explaining the low defect content observed at moderate temperatures.

A many-body resonance emerges at the Fermi energy when an electron bath
screens the magnetic moment of a half-filled impurity level. This Kondo effect,
originally introduced to explain the abnormal resistivity behavior in bulk
magnetic alloys, has been realized in many quantum systems over the past
decades, such as quantum dots, quantum point contacts, nanowires,
single-molecule transistors, heavy-fermion lattices, down to adsorbed single
atoms. While these experiments have provided robust signatures of electronic
correlations at low temperature, the experimentally incomplete characterization
of the spectral function has not only given rise to doubts about the presence
of the Kondo effect itself in some seemingly well-established Kondo systems,
but also hindered adequate testing of theoretical models against experiment.
Here we describe a unique Kondo system which allows a full experimental
determination of all relevant quantities present in the spectral function,
including the impurity energy levels and the spatial modulation of their wave
functions. This approach, based on a discrete half-filled quantum confined
state within a MoS2 grain boundary, enables us to test the validity of the
Anderson model which is the basis of the microscopic understanding of Kondo
physics. The discrepancies uncovered highlight the need for further theoretical
developments.

<h3>Nanoscale friction controlled by top layer thickness in  [LaMnO$_{3}$]$_{m}$/[SrMnO$_{3}$]$_{n}$ superlattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
We conducted lateral force microscopy measurements on seven
[LaMnO$_{3}$]$_{m}$/[SrMnO$_{3}$]$_{n}$ superlattices with varied layer
thicknesses. We observe that the friction forces and the friction coefficients
initially increase with increasing LaMnO3 top layer thickness, followed by
saturation when the top layer thickness exceeds a few nanometers. These
observations clearly demonstrate that sliding friction is affected by
sub-surface material properties to a depth of several nanometers and is not
just determined by dynamics in the contact interface. We argue that the
sub-surface dissipated energy is governed by damping in the elastically
strained volume below the AFM tip, an effect which we estimate via
thermoelasticity. The absence of a correlation between friction and the thermal
resistivity of our superlattices shows furthermore that high-frequency phonons
and heat conduction do not play a role in determining friction. Our
observations thus demonstrate that friction can be tailored by sub-surface
material properties.

Janus materials possess extraordinary physical, chemical, and mechanical
properties caused by symmetry breaking. Here, the mechanic properties,
electronic structure, magnetic properties, and optical properties of Janus
Cr$_2$TeX (X= P, As, Sb) monolayers are systematically investigated by the
density functional theory. Janus Cr$_2$TeP, Cr$_2$TeAs, and Cr$_2$TeSb are
intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) half-metals with wide spin gaps and half-metallic
gaps. Monte Carlo simulations based on the Heisenberg model estimate the Curie
temperature (\emph{T}$_c$) of these monolayers are about 583, 608, and 597 K,
respectively. Additionally, it is found that Cr$_2$TeX (X= P, As, Sb)
monolayers still exhibit FM half-metallic properties under biaxial strain from
-6% to 6%. At last, the Cr$_2$TeP monolayer has a higher absorption coefficient
than the Cr$_2$TeAs and Cr$_2$TeSb monolayers in the visible region. The
results predict that Janus Cr$_2$TeX (X= P, As, Sb) monolayers with novel
properties have good potential for applications in future nanodevices.

Mandal and Jarzynski have proposed a fully autonomous information heat
engine, consisting of a demon, a mass and a memory register interacting with a
thermal reservoir. This device converts thermal energy into mechanical work by
writing information to a memory register, or conversely, erasing information by
consuming mechanical work. Here, we derive a speed limit inequality between the
relaxation time of state transformation and the distance between the initial
and final distributions, where the combination of the dynamical activity and
entropy production plays an important role. Such inequality provides a hint
that a speed-performance trade-off relation exists between the relaxation time
to functional state and the average production. To obtain fast
functionalization while maintaining the performance, we show that the
relaxation dynamics of information heat engine can be accelerated significantly
by devising an optimal initial state of the demon. Our design principle is
inspired by the so-called Mpemba effect, where water freezes faster when
initially heated.

We produce thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) colloidal
hydrogel particles of different stiffnesses by controlling the concentration of
crosslinker in a one-pot synthesis method. We employ oscillatory rheology and
cryogenic scanning electron microscopy to correlate the temperature and
stiffness-induced mechanical properties and microscopic structures of dense
aqueous suspensions of the synthesized PNIPAM colloids. Using Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, we show that particle hydrophobicity increases with
increasing suspension temperature and decreasing particle stiffness. Our
frequency and strain amplitude sweep rheology experiments reveal that the
linear viscoelastic moduli and yield stresses of dense PNIPAM suspensions,
constituted by particles of varying stiffnesses, increase when temperature is
raised above the lower consolute solution temperature (LCST). Combining our
cryogenic scanning electron microscopy and rheology data, we report that dense
suspensions of the softest PNIPAM hydrogels show a gel-liquid-gel transition
when temperature is increased across the LCST. Suspensions of stiff particles,
in contrast, exhibit a glass-glass transition across the LCST without going
through an intermediate liquid state. Our observations reveal that the
temperature-induced phase transformations in dense PNIPAM suspensions depend
sensitively on the stiffness of the constituent particles and can be explained
by considering hydrophobicity-driven morphological changes in the suspension
microstructures over the experimental temperature range. We can therefore
achieve a variety of suspension phases with unique properties by tuning just
the particle stiffness and suspension temperature.

We continue to study frequency-dependent complex bulk viscosities of
one-dimensional Bose and Fermi gases with contact interactions, which exhibit
the weak-strong duality according to our recent work. Here, we show that they
are contributed to by Drude peaks divergent at zero frequency as typical for
transport coefficients of quantum integrable systems in one dimension. In
particular, their Drude weights are evaluated based on the Kubo formula in the
high-temperature limit at arbitrary coupling as well as in the weak-coupling
and strong-coupling limits at arbitrary temperature, where systematic
expansions in terms of small parameters are available. In all the three limits,
the Drude peaks are found at higher orders compared to the finite regular
parts.

We present the ground state properties of a new quantum antiferromagnet
YbBO$_3$ in which the isotropic Yb$^{3+}$ triangular layers are separated by a
non-magnetic layer of partially occupied B and O(2) sites. The magnetization
and heat capacity data establish a spin-orbit entangled effective spin $J_{\rm
eff} = 1/2$ state of Yb$^{3+}$ ions at low temperatures, interacting
antiferromagnetically with an intra-layer coupling $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 0.53$ K.
The absence of oscillations and a $1/3$ tail in the zero-field muon asymmetries
rule out the onset of magnetic long-range-order as well as spin-freezing down
to 20~mK. An anomalous broad maximum in the temperature dependent heat capacity
with a unusually reduced value and a broad anomaly in zero-field muon
depolarization rate centered at $T^*\simeq 0.7 \frac{J}{k_{\rm B}}$ provide
compelling evidence for a wide fluctuating regime ($0.182 \leq T/J \leq 1.63$)
with slow relaxation. We infer that the fluctuating regime is a universal
feature of a highly frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnets while the
absence of magnetic long-range-order is due to perfect two-dimensionality of
the spin-lattice protected by non-magnetic site disorder.

Low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance measurements are performed on

precisely determine microscopic parameters of the spin Hamiltonian of the
parent LiGdF4 material, including the nearest-neighbor exchange constant. The
obtained parameters are further tested by comparing a strongly anisotropic
Curie-Weiss temperature obtained for LiGdF4 in our static magnetization
measurements with theoretically computed values. We find a fine balance between
principal magnetic interactions in LiGdF4, which results in a hidden magnetic
frustration presumably leading to a delayed magnetic ordering and an enhanced
magnetocaloric effect at low temperatures.

Spin properties of organic molecules have attracted great interest for their
potential applications in spintronic devices and quantum computing.
Fe-tetraphenyl porphyrin (FeTPP) is of particular interest for its robust
magnetic properties on metallic substrates. FeTPP is prepared in vacuum via
on-surface synthesis. Molecular structure and spin-related transport properties
are characterized by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope and
spectroscopy at 0.5 K. Density functional theory calculations are performed to
understand molecular adsorption and spin distribution on Au(111). The molecular
structure of FeTPP is distorted upon adsorption on the substrate. Spin
excitations of FeTPP are observed on the Fe atom and high pyrrole groups in
differential conductance spectra. The calculated spin density distribution
indicates that the electron spin of FeTPP is mainly distributed on the Fe atom.
The atomic transmission calculation indicates that electrons transport to
substrate is mediated through Fe atom, when the tip is above the high pyrrole
group.

Current-induced self-sustained magnetization oscillations in spin-torque
nano-oscillators (STNOs) are promising candidates for ultra-agile microwave
sources or detectors. While usually STNOs behave as a monochrome source, we
report here clear bimodal simultaneous emission of incommensurate microwave
oscillations, where the two tones correspond to two parametrically coupled
eigenmodes with tunable splitting. The emission range is crucially sensitive to
the change in hybridization of the eigenmodes of free and fixed layers, for
instance, through a slight tilt of the applied magnetic field from the normal
of the nano-pillar. Our experimental findings are supported both analytically
and by micromagnetic simulations, which ascribe the process to four-magnon
scattering between a pair of radially symmetric magnon modes and a pair of
magnon modes with opposite azimuthal index. Our findings open up new
possibilities for cognitive telecommunications and neuromorphic systems that

A CMOS-based implementation of an autonomous Maxwell's demon was recently
proposed (Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 120602) to demonstrate that a Maxwell demon can
still work at macroscopic scales, provided that its power supply is scaled
appropriately. Here, we first provide a full analytical characterization of the
non-autonomous version of that model. We then study system-demon information
flows within generic autonomous bipartite setups displaying a macroscopic
limit. By doing so, we can study the thermodynamic efficiency of both the
measurement and the feedback process performed by the demon. We find that the
information flow is an intensive quantity and that as a consequence, any
Maxwell's demon is bound to stop working above a finite scale if all parameters
but the scale are fixed. However, this can be prevented by appropriately
scaling the thermodynamic forces. These general results are applied to the
autonomous CMOS-based demon.

We report the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the anomalous Nernst effect
(ANE) data for the non-collinear Weyl semimetal CeAlSi. The anomalous Hall
conductivity ({\sigma}_ij^A) was measured for two different orientations of the
magnetic field (B), namely {\sigma}_yz^A for B II a and {\sigma}_xy^A for B II
c, where a and c denote the crystallographic axes. We find that {\sigma}_xy^A
and {\sigma}_yz^A are of opposite sign and both are large below the Curie
temperature (T_C). In the paramagnetic phase, {\sigma}_xy^A raises even more
and goes through a maximum at T ~ 170 K, whereas the absolute value of
{\sigma}_yz^A decreases with increasing temperature. The origin of the sign
difference between {\sigma}_xy^A and {\sigma}_yz^A was attributed to the
reconstruction of the band structure under the variation of the spin
orientation. Further, in a system where humps in the AHE are present and scalar
spin chirality is zero, we show that the k-space topology plays an important
role to determine the transport properties at both low and high temperatures.
We also observed the anomalous contribution in the Nernst conductivity
({\alpha}_xy^A) measured for B II c. {\alpha}_xy^A/T turns out to be sizeable
in the magnetic phase and above T_C slowly decreases with temperature. We were
able to recreate the temperature dependences of {\sigma}_xy^A and
{\alpha}_xy^A/T in the paramagnetic phase using a single band toy-model
assuming a non-zero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the Weyl node. A
decisive factor appears to be a small energy distance between the Fermi level
and a Weyl point.

We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a Luttinger liquid after a
simultaneous quantum quench of the interaction and dissipative quench to the
environment within the realm of the Lindblad equation. When the couplings to
environment satisfy detailed balance, the system is destined to thermalize,
which we follow using bosonization. The thermodynamic entropy of the system,
which also encodes information about the entanglement with the environment,
either exhibits a maximum and minimum or grows monotonically before reaching
its thermal value in a universal fashion. The single-particle density matrix
reveals rich behaviour in the spatio-temporal "phase diagram", including
thermal, prethermal and dissipation enhanced sudden quench Luttinger liquid
behaviour as well as dissipation enhanced Fermi liquid response.

One of the major obstacles to realizing spintronic devices such as MESO logic
devices is the small signal magnitude used for magnetization readout, making it
important to find materials with high spin-to-charge conversion efficiency.
Although intermixing at the junction of two materials is a widely occurring
phenomenon, its influence on material characterization and the estimation of
spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies is easily neglected or underestimated.
Here, we demonstrate all electrical spin-to-charge conversion in
Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ nanodevices and show how the conversion efficiency can be
overestimated by tens of times depending on the adjacent metal used as a
contact. We attribute this to the intermixing-induced compositional change and
the properties of a polycrystal that lead to drastic changes in resistivity and
spin Hall angle. Strategies to improve the spin-to-charge conversion signal in
similar structures for functional devices are discussed.

<h3>Stability of particle laden interfaces of drops flowing through a pore</h3>

When a drop laden with solid particles and suspended in a liquid passes
through a narrow pore, its interface experiences strong shear and elongation,
and the raft of particles may accumulate toward the back of the drop. Using
well controlled formulations of Pickering drops driven at set pressure, we
determine the two conditions for which solid particles are expelled from the
oil-water interface after a Pickering drop passes a converging-diverging pore:
(i) particles accumulation at the rear of the drop is such that surface
pressure builds-up at the interface. (ii) Surface pressure relaxation by
buckling is impaired by geometrical constraints. These two conditions are
rationalized using three non dimensional numbers: the capillary number, the
particle to pore size ratio, and the drop to particle size ratio, which allow
to account for the viscous shear at the interface, the stability of the
lubricating film between the pore wall and the drop, the drag on the raft of
particles adsorbed at the interface, and its mechanical behaviour.

<br>
Lipid nanotube-vesicle networks are important channels for intercellular
communication and transport of matter. Experimentally observed in neighboring
mammalian cells, but also reproduced in model membrane systems, a broad
consensus exists on their formation and stability. Lipid membranes must be
composed of at least two molecular components, each stabilizing low (generally
a phospholipid) and high curvatures. Strong anisotropy or enhanced conical
shape of the second amphiphile is crucial for the formation of nanotunnels.
Anisotropic driving forces generally favor nanotube protrusions from vesicles.
In the present work, we report the unique case of topologically-connected
nanotubes-vesicles obtained in the absence of directional forces, in
single-molecule membranes, composed of an anisotropic bolaform glucolipid,
above its melting temperature, Tm. Cryo-TEM and fluorescence confocal
microscopy show the interconnection between vesicles and nanotubes in a
single-phase region, between 60{\textdegree} and 90{\textdegree}C under diluted
conditions. Solid-state NMR demonstrates that the glucolipid can assume two
distinct configurations, head-head and head-tail. These arrangements, seemingly
of comparable energy above the Tm, could explain the existence and stability of
the topologically-connected vesicles and nanotubes, which are generally not
observed for classical single-molecule phospholipid-based membranes above their
Tm.

<h3>Exciting long-lived Higgs mode in superfluid Fermi gases with particle  removal</h3>

Experimental evidence of the Higgs mode in strongly interacting superfluid
Fermi gases has not been observed until not long ago [A. Behrle et al., Nat.
Phys. 14, 781 (2018)]. Due to the coupling with other collective modes and
quasiparticle excitations, generating stable Higgs-mode oscillations is
challenging. We study how to excite long-lived Higgs-mode oscillations in a
homogeneous superfluid Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover. We find that the
Higgs mode can be excited by time-periodically modulating the scattering length
at an appropriate amplitude and frequency. However, even for a modulation
frequency below twice the pairing gap energy, quasiparticles are still excited
through the generation of higher harmonics due to nonlinearity in the
superfluid. More importantly, we find that persistent Higgs-mode oscillations
with almost constant amplitude can be produced by removing particles at an
appropriate momentum, and the oscillation amplitude can be controlled by the
number of removed particles. Finally, we propose two ways of experimental
realization of particle removal.

<h3>Sensing Remote Bulk Defects Through Resistance Noise in a Large Area  Graphene Field Effect Transistor</h3>

Substrate plays a crucial role in determining transport and low frequency
noise behavior of graphene field effect devices. Typically, heavily dope
Si/SiO$_2$ substrate is used to fabricate these devices for efficient gating.
Trapping-detrapping processes closed to the graphene/substrate interface are
the dominant sources of resistance fluctuations in the graphene channel, while
Coulomb fluctuations arising due to any remote charge fluctuations inside the
bulk of the substrate are effectively screened by the heavily doped substrate.
Here, we present electronic transport and low frequency noise characteristics
of large area CVD graphene field effect transistor (FET) prepared on a lightly
doped Si/SiO$_2$ substrate (N$_A$ $\sim$ 10$^{15}$cm$^{-3}$). Through a
systematic characterization of transport, noise and capacitance at various
temperature, we reveal that remote Si/SiO$_2$ interface can affect the charge
transport in graphene severely and any charge fluctuations inside bulk of the
silicon substrate can be sensed by the graphene channel. The resistance (R) vs.
back gate voltage (V$_{bg}$) characteristics of the device shows a hump around
the depletion region formed at the SiO$_2$/Si interface, confirmed by the
capacitance (C) - Voltage (V) measurement. Low frequency noise measurement on
these fabricated devices shows a peak in the noise amplitude close to the
depletion region. This indicates that due to the absence of any charge layer at
Si/SiO$_2$ interface, screening ability decreases and as a consequence, any
fluctuations in the deep level coulomb impurities inside the silicon substrate
can be observed as a noise in resistance in graphene channel via mobility
fluctuations. Noise behavior on ionic liquid gated graphene on the same
substrate exhibits no such peak in noise and can be explained by the
interfacial trapping - detrapping processes closed to the graphene channel.

<h3>The vanishing of excess heat for nonequilibrium processes reaching zero  ambient temperature</h3>

We present the mathematical ingredients for an extension of the Third Law of
Thermodynamics (Nernst heat postulate) to nonequilibrium processes. The central
quantity is the excess heat which measures the quasistatic addition to the
steady dissipative power when a parameter in the dynamics is changed slowly. We
prove for a class of driven Markov jump processes that it vanishes at zero
environment temperature. As an application, the nonequilibrium heat capacity
goes to zero with temperature as well. Main ingredients in the proof are the
matrix-forest theorem for the relaxation behavior of the heat flux, and the
matrix-tree theorem giving the low-temperature asymptotics of the stationary
probability. From that arborification, the main new condition for the extended
Third Law is dynamical and requires the absence of major (low-temperature
induced) delays in the relaxation to the steady dissipative structure.

Quantum Hall physics is at the heart of research on both matter and
artificial systems, such as cold atomic gases, with non-trivial topological
order. We report on the observation of a chiral edge current in a synthetic
quantum Hall system with distinct bulk and edge behavior, realized in the
two-dimensional state space formed by one spatial and one synthetic dimension
encoded in the J = 6 electronic spin of erbium atoms. To characterize the
system, the Hall drift of the employed atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in the
lowest Landau level is determined. The topological properties are verified by
determining the local Chern marker, and upon performing system excitations both
cyclotron and skipping orbits are observed in the bulk and edge respectively.
Future prospects include studies of novel topological phases in cold atom
systems.

<h3>Efficient calculation of three-dimensional tensor networks</h3>

<i>Li-Ping Yang, Y. F. Fu, Z. Y. Xie, T. Xiang</i>
<br>
<br>
We have proposed an efficient algorithm to calculate physical quantities in
the translational invariant three-dimensional tensor networks, which is
particularly relevant to the study of the three-dimensional classical
statistical models and the (2+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. In the
context of a classical model, we determine the partition function by solving
the dominant eigenvalue problem of the transfer matrix, whose left and right
dominant eigenvectors are represented by two projected entangled simplex
states. These two projected entangled simplex states are not hermitian
conjugate to each other but are appropriately arranged so that their inner
product can be computed much more efficiently than in the usual prescription.
For the three-dimensional Ising model, the calculated internal energy and
spontaneous magnetization agree with the published results in the literature.
The possible improvement and extension to other models are also discussed.

Starting from the Keldysh theory, for a general low energy multiband
Hamiltonian in the clean limit, we perform a manifestly $\smash{U(1) \times
SU(N)}$ gauge invariant semiclassical expansion. A generalization of the Berry
curvature tensor is shown to control newly found interband spectral weights.
New expressions for the expectation value of certain physical quantities ensue,
establishing the necessity of an alternate interpretation and modification of a
previously proposed correction to the density of states. In the two-band case,
a complete semiclassical kinetic theory including all $O(\hbar)$ quantum
geometric corrections is rigorously derived from quantum transport theory for
the first time.

<br>
<br>
We discuss an interferometric scheme employing interference of bright
solitons formed as specific bound states of attracting bosons on a lattice. We
revisit the proposal of Castin and Weiss [Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 102, 010403
(2009)] for using the scattering of a quantum matter-wave soliton on a barrier
in order to create a coherent superposition state of the soliton being entirely
to the left of the barrier and being entirely to the right of the barrier. In
that proposal, it was assumed that the scattering is perfectly elastic, i.e.\
that the center-of-mass kinetic energy of the soliton is lower than the
chemical potential of the soliton. Here we relax this assumption: By employing
a combination of Bethe ansatz and DMRG based analysis of the dynamics of the
appropriate many-body system, we find that the interferometric fringes persist
even when the center-of-mass kinetic energy of the soliton is above the energy
needed for its complete dissociation into constituent atoms.

<h3>Phase transition in the computational complexity of the shortest common  superstring and genome assembly</h3>

Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by
aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either
as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a
Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow
exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact,
high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow
bioinformaticians to produce and assemble datasets of billions of reads. Using
methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating
the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the
problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the `easy' phase
(solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic
algorithms in the hard regime.

<h3>First-principles Study of Phonon Lifetime and Low Lattice Thermal  Conductivity of Monolayer γ-GeSe: A Comparative Study</h3>

Germanium selenide (GeSe) is a unique two-dimensional (2D) material showing
various polymorphs stable at ambient condition. Recently, a new phase with a
layered hexagonal lattice ({\gamma}-GeSe) was synthesized with ambient
stability and extraordinary electronic conductivity even higher than graphite
while its monolayer is semiconducting. In this work, via using first-principles
derived force constants and Boltzmann transport theory we explore the lattice
thermal conductivity ({\kappa}_l) of the monolayer {\gamma}-GeSe, together with
a comparison with monolayer {\alpha}-GeSe and {\beta}-GeSe. The {\kappa}_l of
{\gamma}-phase is relatively low (5.50 W/mK), comparable with those of
{\alpha}- and {\beta}- phases. The acoustic branches in {\alpha}-GeSe are well
separated from the optical branches, limiting scattering channels in the phase
space, while for \b{eta}-GeSe and {\gamma}-GeSe the acoustic branches are
resonant with the low-frequency optical branches facilitating more
phonon-phonon scattering. For {\gamma}-GeSe, the cumulative {\kappa}_l is
isotropic and phononic representative mean free path (rMFP) is the shortest
(17.07 nm) amongst the three polymorphs, indicating that the {\kappa}_l of the
{\gamma} phase is less likely to be affected by the size of the sample, while
for {\alpha}-GeSe the cumulative {\kappa}_l grows slowly with mean free path
and the rMFP is longer (up to 20.56 and 35.94 nm along zigzag and armchair
direction, respectively), showing a stronger size-dependence of {\kappa}_l. Our
work suggests that GeSe polymorphs with overall low thermal conductivity are
promising contenders for thermoelectric and thermal management applications.

<h3>Versatile van der Waals Heterostructures of Gamma-GeSe with  h-BN/Graphene/MoS2</h3>

<br>

Recent discovery of a novel hexagonal phase of GeSe (Gamma-GeSe) has
triggered great interests in nanoelectronics applications owing to its
electrical conductivity of bulk phase even higher than graphite while its
monolayer is a semiconductor. For potential applications, construction of
functional two-dimensional (2D) contacts is indispensable. Herein, via
first-principles calculations, we propose the design of van der Waals
heterostructures (vdWHs) of Gamma-GeSe contacting respectively with graphene,
2D h-BN and MoS2, as representatives of metallic, insulator, and semiconductor
partners. Our work shows that the h-BN or graphene layer donates electrons to
the Gamma-GeSe layer, resulting in n doping in Gamma-GeSe, while the MoS2 layer
accepts electrons from the Gamma-GeSe layer leading to p doping of the latter.
The Gamma-GeSe/BN heterostructure has a type-I band alignment with large band
offsets, indicating that BN can be used as an effective passivating layer to
protect Gamma-GeSe from its environmental disturbance while maintaining its
major electronic and optical characteristics. For Gamma-GeSe/graphene
heterostructure, it is prone to have a very low-Schottky barrier down to tens
of meV, easily overcome by thermal excitation, which can be tunable by strain
and external electric field. The Gamma-GeSe/MoS2 vdWH forms a Z-scheme
interface, which is beneficial for carriers splitting and photon utilization.
Our work indicates that Gamma-GeSe can be well passivated by BN, and form
intimate contact with graphene for high charge injection efficiency and with
MoS2 for efficient carriers splitting for redox reactions.

<br>
Thickness uniformity is regarded as an important parameter in designing thin
film devices. However, some applications based on films with non-uniform
thickness have recently emerged, such as gas sensors and optimized materials
based on the gradual change of film composition. This work deals with
superconducting Pb thin films with a thickness gradient prepared with the aid
of a diffuse stencil mask. Atomic Force Microscopy and Energy-Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy show variations ranging from 90~nm to 154~nm. Quantitative
magneto-optical images reveal interesting features during both the abrupt and
the smooth penetration regimes of magnetic flux, as well as the
thickness-dependent critical current density ($J_c$). In addition, we observe a
gradual superconducting transition as the upper critical field is progressively
reached for certain thicknesses. Furthermore, the hysteresis observed for
triggering flux avalanches when increasing and decreasing magnetic fields is
also accounted for by the $J_c$ profile evolution along the thickness gradient.
Numerical simulations based on the Thermomagnetic Model are in fair agreement
with the experimental data. These findings demonstrate that wedge-shaped films
are a viable approach to investigate, in a continuous fashion,
thickness-dependent properties of a superconducting materials.

We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two
classical magnetic impurities in one-dimensional lattice models with flat
bands. As two representative examples, we pick the stub lattice and the diamond
lattice at half filling. We first calculate the exact RKKY interaction
numerically and then compare our data to results obtained via different
analytical techniques. In both our examples, we find that the RKKY interaction
exhibits peculiar features that can directly be traced back to the presence of
a flat band. Importantly, these features are not captured by the conventional
RKKY approximation based on non-degenerate perturbation theory. Instead, we
find that degenerate perturbation theory correctly reproduces our exact results
if there is an energy gap between the flat and the dispersive bands, while a
non-perturbative approach becomes necessary in the absence of a gap.
