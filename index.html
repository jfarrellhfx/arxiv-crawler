<h3>Emitter-Optomechanical Interaction in high-Q hBN Nanocavities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00150</a>

<i>Chenjiang Qian, Viviana Villafañe, Martin Schalk, Georgy V. Astakhov, Ulrich Kentsch, Manfred Helm, Alexander Hötger, Pedro Soubelet, Alexander W. Holleitner, Andreas V. Stier, Jonathan J. Finley</i>
<br>
We investigate the interaction between charged boron vacancies $V_B^-$ in hBN
and optomechanical modes in a nanobeam cavity using spatially resolved
photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy. $V_B^-$ is a point defect
emitter and the emission is dominated by phonon-assisted processes. As such,
the $V_B^-$ emission is intrinsically sensitive to, and interacts with local
deformations such as lattice phonons and cavity optomechanical vibrations. We
observe a pronounced spectral asymmetry of the high-Q ($\sim10^5$) nanocavity
photonic mode that is only presented for cavities containing $V_B^-$ emitters,
revealing the emitter-induced active cavity optomechanics. Meanwhile, we reveal
the cavity-induced control of phonon-assisted $V_B^-$ emission by exploring the
luminescence with position-dependent vibrations in freely suspended structures
and the resonant excitation of cavity photons with cooling and heating
detunings. Our results show how $V_B^-$ defect related phonons mediate the
coupling between defect emission, cavity photonic and vibronic modes as an
emitter-optomechanical system. Such an interplay bewteen different vibronic
(defect phonon, nanomechanical vibration) and photonic (cavity modes) extends
the cavity QED system and provide new paradigms for interfacing spin, photons
and phonons in condensed matters.

The dynamics and rheology of a vesicle confined in a channel under shear flow
are studied at finite temperature. The effect of finite temperature on vesicle
motion and system viscosity is investigated. A two-dimensional numerical model,
which includes thermal fluctuations and is based on a combination of molecular
dynamics and mesoscopic hydrodynamics, is used to perform a detailed analysis
in a wide range of the Peclet numbers (the ratio of the shear rate to the
rotational diffusion coefficient). The suspension viscosity is found to be a
monotonous increasing function of the viscosity contrast (the ratio of the
viscosity of the encapsulated fluid to that of the surrounding fluid) both in
the tank-treading and the tumbling regime due to the interplay of different
temperature-depending mechanisms. Thermal effects induce shape and inclination
fluctuations of the vesicle which experiences also Brownian diffusion across
the channel increasing the viscosity. These effects reduces when increasing the
Peclet number.

<h3>Lattice Transformation from 2-D to Quasi 1-D and Phonon Properties of  Exfoliated ZrS2 and ZrSe2</h3>

<br>
We investigate the thermal properties of these Zirconium based materials
using confocal Raman spectroscopy. We observed 2 different and distinctive
Raman signatures for exfoliated ZrX2 (where X = S or Se). These Raman modes
generally depend on the shape of the exfoliated nanosheets, regardless of the
incident laser polarization. These 2 shapes are divided into 2D- ZrX2 and quasi
1D- ZrX2. For 2D- ZrX2, Raman modes are in alignment with those reported in
literature. However, for quasi 1D-ZrX2, we show that Raman modes are identical
to exfoliated ZrX3 nanosheets, indicating a major lattice transformation from
2D to quasi-1D. We also measure thermal properties of each resonant Raman mode
for each ZrX2 shape. Based on our measurements, most Raman modes exhibit a
linear downshift dependence with temperature. However, for ZrS2, we see an
upshift (blueshift) with temperature for A1g mode, which is attributed to
non-harmonic effects caused by dipolar coupling with IR-active modes. Moreover,
the observed temperature dependence coefficient for some phonon modes of quasi
1D-ZrX2 differ dramatically, which can be caused by the quasi 1D lattice.
Finally, we measure phonon dynamics under optical heating for each of 2D-ZrX2
and quasi 1D-ZrX2 and show phonon confinement in quasi 1D-ZrX2 nanosheets. We
extract the thermal conductivity and the interfacial thermal conductance for
each of 2D-ZrX2 and quasi 1D-ZrX2 nanosheets. Our calculations indicate lower
interfacial thermal conductance for quasi 1D-ZrX2 compared to 2D-ZrX2, which
can be attributed to the phonon confinement in 1D. Based on our model, we show
low thermal conductivity for all ZrX2 nanosheets. Our results demonstrate
exceptional thermal properties for ZrX2 materials, making them ideal for future
thermal management strategies and thermoelectric device applications.

<h3>Contact angle of water on a model heterogeneous surface. A density  functional approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01022" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01022</a>
<br>
<i>K. Dąbrowska, O. Pizio, S. Sokołowski</i>
<br>
We use a density functional approach to calculate the contact angle of the
water model on a heterogeneous, graphite-like surface. The surface
heterogeneity results from the pre-adsorption of a layer of spherical species.
The pre-adsorbed molecules can also be a mixture of molecules of different
sizes. The presence of pre-adsorbed layer causes geometrical and energetical
heterogeneity of the surfaces. Two cases are considered. The pre-adsorbed
molecules can either behave like hard-sphere obstacles, or they can also
attract the molecules of water. In the first case, an increase of the amount of
pre-adsorbed species leads to an increase of the wetting temperature, but this
increase does not depend linearly on the amount of obstacles. In the case of
obstacles exerting attractive forces on water molecules, the curves describing
the dependence between the amount of pre-adsorbed species and the contact angle
can exhibit a maximum. In addition, we have also studied how the pre-adsorbed
species influence the local densities of gaseous and liquid phases in contact
with a modified solid surface.

<h3>Energetics, electronic states, and magnetism of iron phthalocyanine on  pristine and defected graphene layers</h3>

<br>
Transition metal phthalocyanines (TMPc's) are under intense scrutiny in the
field of spintronics, as they may be promising storage devices. The simplicity
and cheapness of such molecules increase their commercial potential. There is
an active study of how the magnetic moment of the metal centre of such
molecules can be changed. Here, we particularly consider the iron
phthalocyanine molecule (FePc) on a graphene layer as a substrate. We study how
graphene defects (the Stone-Wales defect, B-doping, N-doping, S-doping, and
combined B (N, S)-doped Stone-Wales defects) change the FePc electronic
structure. We present ab initio study of the systems, which is done using
several approaches: based on periodic plane wave density functional theory
(DFT), a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) DFT with a cluster
representation of graphene, and multiconfigurational methods with the pyrene
molecule presented as a miniaturised graphene cluster. The treatment of the
FePc/Graphene hybrid system using multiconfigurational methods was done for the
first time. It was found that the hybrid systems with B- and N- dopings have
quasi-degenerate ground states and it is necessary to go beyond the
approximation of one Slater determinant.

Shape transformations of hairy nanoparticles under confinement are studied
using molecular dynamic simulations. We discuss the behavior of these particles
in slits with inert or attractive walls. We assume that only chain-wall
interactions are attractive. The impact of the strength of interactions with
the walls and the width of the slits on the particle configuration is shown. In
the case of attractive surfaces, we found new structures in which the chains
are connected with both walls and form bridges between them: pillars,
symmetrical and asymmetrical spools, and hourglasses. In wide pores with
strongly attractive walls, hairy particles adsorb on one of the surfaces and
form "mounds" or starfish-like strucures.

<h3>Unidirectional subsystem symmetry in a hole-doped honeycomb-lattice  Ising magnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00012</a>
<br>
<i>Sambuddha Sanyal, Alexander Wietek, John Sous</i>
<br>
We study a model of a hole-doped collinear Ising antiferromagnet on the
honeycomb lattice as a route toward the realization of subsystem symmetry. We
find nearly exact conservation of dipole symmetry verified both numerically
with exact diagonalization (ED) on finite clusters and analytically with
perturbation theory. The emergent symmetry forbids the motion of single holes
-- or fractons -- but allows hole pairs -- or dipoles -- to move freely along a
one-dimensional line, the antiferromagnetic direction, of the system; in the
transverse direction, both fractons and dipoles are completely localized. This
presents a realization of a `unidirectional' subsystem symmetry. By studying
interactions between dipoles, we argue that the subsystem symmetry is likely to
continue to persist up to finite (but probably small) hole concentrations.

<h3>Generalized thermalization in quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians</h3>

<br>
Thermalization (generalized thermalization) in nonintegrable (integrable)
quantum systems requires two ingredients, equilibration and an agreement with
the predictions of the Gibbs (generalized Gibbs) ensemble. We prove that
observables that exhibit eigenstate thermalization in single-particle sector
equilibrate in many-body sectors of quantum-chaotic quadratic models.
Remarkably, the same observables do not exhibit eigenstate thermalization in
many-body sectors (we establish that there are exponentially many outliers).
Hence, the generalized Gibbs ensemble is generally needed to describe their
expectation values after equilibration, and it is characterized by Lagrange
multipliers that are smooth functions of single-particle energies.

<h3>Entanglement spectroscopy of anomalous surface states</h3>

<i>Arjun Dey, David F. Mross</i>
<br>
We study entanglement spectra of gapped states on the surfaces of
symmetry-protected topological phases. These surface states carry anomalies
that do not allow them to be terminated by a trivial state. Their entanglement
spectra are dominated by non-universal features, which reflect the underlying
bulk. We introduce a modified type of entanglement spectra that incorporate the
anomaly and argue that they correspond to physical edge states between
different surface states. We support these arguments by explicit analytical and
numerical calculations for free and interacting surfaces of three-dimensional
topological insulators of electrons.

<h3>Non-uniform vestigial charge-4e phase in the Kagome superconductor  CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>

<br>
Pair density wave state and its vestigial charge-4e and 6e superconducting
phases have been reported in the Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. By
treating the charge density waves that are ordered at high temperatures as
static backgrounds, we notice that all pair density waves have the same
wavevector in the folded 2D Brillouin zone. This wavevector is at a high
symmetry point and preserves time-reversal symmetry. The PDW state is thus
neither `FF'-like nor `LO'-like. With this non-degenerate pair density wave, we
illustrate the resulting necessity for the vestigial charge-4e phase to be
non-uniform. We will also highlight the importance of disorder in stabilizing
vestigial phases in a commensurate system.

<h3>Ultrafast generation of hidden phases via energy-tuned electronic  photoexcitation in magnetite</h3>

<br>
Metal-insulator transitions (MIT) occurring in non-adiabatic conditions can
evolve through high-energy intermediate states that are difficult to observe
and control via static methods. By monitoring the out-of-equilibrium structural
dynamics of a magnetite (Fe3O4) crystal via ultrafast electron diffraction, we
show that MITs can evolve through different pathways by properly selecting the
electronic excitation with light. Near-infrared (800 nm) photons inducing d-d
electronic transitions is found to favor the destruction of the long-range
zigzag network of the trimerons and to generate a phase separation between
cubic-metallic and monoclinic-insulating regions. Instead, visible light (400
nm) further promotes the long-range order of the trimerons by stabilizing the
charge density wave fluctuations through the excitation of the oxygen 2p to
iron 3d charge transfer and, thus, fosters a reinforcement of the monoclinic
insulating phase. Our experiments demonstrate that tailored light pulses can
drive strongly correlated materials into different hidden phases, influencing
the lifetime and emergent properties of the intermediate states.

<h3>A Layered Spin 1/2 polymorph of titanium triiodide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00097" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00097</a>

<br>
A previously unreported layered spin 1/2 triangular lattice polymorph of TiI3
is described, synthesized under 6 GPa of applied pressure at 900 C, but stable
at atmospheric pressure. This air-sensitive material has a CdI2-type layered
structure (P-3m1 (#164), a = 4.012 A and c = 6.641 A at 120 K, Z = 1 of
Ti0.667I2) with an in-plane triangular lattice, related to that of TiI4
(Ti0.5I2). Although the TiI3 formula is consistent with expectations for a
layered honeycomb lattice of spin 1/2 Ti(III), there appears to be disorder in
the crystal structure. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements
suggest that the material undergoes several low temperature phase transitions.

<h3>Interplay of gross and fine structures in strongly-curved sheets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00099</a>

<br>
Although thin films are typically manufactured in planar sheets or rolls,
they are often forced into three-dimensional shapes, producing a plethora of
structures across multiple length-scales. Existing theoretical approaches have
made progress by separating the behaviors at different scales and limiting
their scope to one. Under large confinement, a geometric model has been
proposed to predict the gross shape of the sheet, which averages out the fine
features. However, the actual meaning of the gross shape, and how it constrains
the fine features, remains unclear. Here, we study a thin-membraned balloon as
a prototypical system that involves a doubly curved gross shape with large
amplitude undulations. By probing its profiles and cross sections, we discover
that the geometric model captures the mean behavior of the film. We then
propose a minimal model for the balloon cross sections, as independent elastic
filaments subjected to an effective pinning potential around the mean shape.
This approach allows us to combine the global and local features consistently.
Despite the simplicity of our model, it reproduces a broad range of phenomena
seen in the experiments, from how the morphology changes with pressure to the
detailed shape of the wrinkles and folds. Our results establish a new route to
understanding finite buckled structures over an enclosed surface, which could
aid the design of inflatable structures, or provide insight into biological
patterns.

<h3>Superconducting source and sensor of single bubbles to study nucleate  boiling of liquid helium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00112</a>
<br>

<br>
Joule heat generated by resistive elements of cryogenic micro- and
nanodevices often originates boiling of the cooling cryogenic liquids (helium,
nitrogen). The article proposes an experimental method to explore the dynamics
of the formation and development of a single vapor bubble in cryogenic liquid
by sensing the temperature change of a superconducting thin-film microbridge
being in the resistive state with single phase-slip center or line. It serves
both the source of heat for generating single bubbles and the surface
temperature sensor due to its temperature-dependant excess current. The average
bubble detachment rate and the average single bubble volume were experimentally
determined for nucleate helium boiling. The obtained values are in good
agreement with the data of other authors found in literature.

<h3>Many-body description of STM-induced fluorescence of charged molecules</h3>

<br>

<br>
A scanning tunneling microscope is used to study the fluorescence of a model
charged molecule (quinacridone) adsorbed on a sodium chloride (NaCl)-covered
metallic sample. Fluorescence from the neutral and positively charged species
is reported and imaged using hyper-resolved fluorescence microscopy. A
many-body excitation model is established based on a detailed analysis of
voltage, current and spatial dependencies of the fluorescence and electron
transport features. This model reveals that quinacridone adopts a large palette
of charge states, transient or not, depending on the voltage used and the
nature of the underlying substrate. This model has a universal character and
explains the electronic and fluorescence properties of many other molecules
adsorbed on thin insulators.

<h3>Entropy and Seebeck signals meet on the edges</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00151</a>
<br>

<br>
We explore the electronic entropy per particle $s$ and Seebeck coefficient
$\mathcal{S}$ in zigzag graphene ribbons. Pristine and edge-doped ribbons are
considered using tight-binding models to inspect the role of edge states in the
observed thermal transport properties. As a bandgap opens when the ribbons are
doped at one or both edges, due to asymmetric edge potentials, we find that $s$
and $\mathcal{S}$ signals are closely related to each other: both develop sharp
dip-peak lineshapes as the chemical potential lies in the gap, while the ratio
$s/\mathcal{S}$ exhibits a near constant value equal to the elementary charge
$e$ at low temperatures. This constant ratio suggests that $\mathcal{S}$ can be
seen as the transport differential entropy per charge, as suggested by some
authors. Our calculations also indicate that measurement of $s$ and
$\mathcal{S}$ may be useful as a spectroscopic probe of different electronic
energy scales involved in such quantities in gapped materials.

<h3>$py$GWBSE: A high throughput workflow package for GW-BSE calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00152" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00152</a>
<br>
<i>Tathagata Biswas, Arunima K. Singh</i>
<br>
We develop an open-source python workflow package, $py$GWBSE to perform
automated first-principles calculations within the GW-BSE (Bethe-Salpeter)
framework. GW-BSE is a many body perturbation theory based approach to explore
the quasiparticle (QP) and excitonic properties of materials. The GW
approximation has proven to be effective in accurately predicting bandgaps of a
wide range of materials by overcoming the bandgap underestimation issues of the
more widely used density functional theory (DFT). The BSE formalism, in spite
of being computationally expensive, produces absorption spectra directly
comparable with experimental observations. The $py$GWBSE package achieves
complete automation of the entire multi-step GW-BSE computation, including the
convergence tests of several parameters that are crucial for the accuracy of
these calculations. $py$GWBSE is integrated with $Wannier90$, a program for
calculating maximally-localized wannier functions, allowing the generation of
QP bandstructures. $py$GWBSE also enables automated creation of databases of
metadata and data, including QP and excitonic properties, which can be
extremely useful for future material discovery studies in the field of
ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors, electronics, photovoltaics, and
photocatalysis.

<h3>Observation of gapless nodal-line states in NdSbTe</h3>

<br>
Lanthanide (Ln) based systems in the ZrSiS-type nodal-line semimetals have
been subjects of research investigations as grounds for studying the interplay
of topology with possible magnetic ordering and electronic correlations that
may originate from the presence of Ln 4f electrons. In this study, we carried
out a thorough study of a LnSbTe system - NdSbTe - by using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy along with first-principles calculations and
thermodynamic measurements. We experimentally detect the presence of multiple
gapless nodal-line states, which is well supported by first-principles
calculations. A dispersive and an almost non-dispersive nodal-line exist along
the bulk X-R direction. Another nodal-line is present well below the Fermi
level across the G- M direction, which is formed by bands with high Fermi
velocity that seem to be sensitive to light polarization. Our study provides an
insight into the electronic structure of a new LnSbTe material system that will
aid towards understanding the connection of Ln elements with topological
electronic structure in these systems.

<h3>Stochastic Paleoclimatology: Modeling the EPICA Ice Core Climate Records</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00308" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00308</a>
<br>
<i>N. D. B. Keyes, L. T. Giorgini, J. S. Wettlaufer</i>
<br>
We analyze and model the stochastic behavior of paleoclimate time series and
assess the implications for the coupling of climate variables during the
Pleistocene glacial cycles. We examine 800 kyr of carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, and temperature proxy data from the EPICA Dome-C ice core, which
are characterized by 100~kyr glacial cycles overlain by fluctuations across a
wide range of time scales. We quantify this behavior through multifractal
time-weighted detrended fluctuation analysis, which distinguishes near
red-noise and white-noise behavior below and above the 100~kyr glacial cycle
respectively in all records. This allows us to model each time series as a
one-dimensional periodic non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system, and assess
the stability of physical processes and the fidelity of model-simulated time
series. We extend this approach to a four-variable model with linear coupling
terms, which we interpret in terms of the interrelationships between the time
series. Methane and nitrous oxide are found to have significant destabilizing
influences, while carbon dioxide and temperature have smaller stabilizing
influences. We draw conclusions about causal relationships in glacial
transitions and the climate processes that may have facilitated these
couplings, and highlight opportunities to further develop stochastic modeling
approaches.

<h3>Quantum quenches in the sinh-Gordon and Lieb-Liniger models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00316</a>
<br>
<i>Emanuele Di Salvo, Dirk Schuricht</i>
<br>
The non-relativistic limit of integrable field theories at equilibrium has
been intensively studied in the previous years; the simplest non-trivial case
relates the sinh-Gordon model to the Lieb-Liniger model. Here we study this
non-relativistic limit out of equilibrium, namely in the time evolution after a
quantum quench. The obtained results agree with the known ones for the
Lieb-Liniger model, thus showing that the non-relativistic limit is applicable
in this out-of-equilibrium setting.

<h3>The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition and Anomalous Metallic  Phase in a Hybrid Josephson Junction Array</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00318</a>
<br>
<i>C. G. L. Bøttcher, F. Nichele, J. Shabani, C. J. Palmstrøm, C. M. Marcus</i>
<br>
We investigate the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a
semiconductor-superconductor two-dimensional Josephson junction array. Tuned by
an electrostatic top gate, the system exhibits separate superconducting (S),
anomalous metal (M*), and insulating (I) phases, bordered by separatrices of
the temperature-dependent of sheet resistance, $R_{s}$. We find that the
gate-dependent BKT transition temperature falls to zero at the S-M* boundary,
suggesting incomplete vortex-antivortex pairing in the M* phase. In the S
phase, $R_{s}$ is roughly proportional to perpendicular magnetic field at the
BKT transition, as expected, while in the M* phase $R_{s}$ deviates from its
zero-field value as a power-law in field with exponent close to 1/2 at low
temperature. An in-plane magnetic field eliminates the M* phase, leaving a
small scaling exponent at the S-I boundary, which we interpret as a remnant of
the incipient M* phase.

<br>
As machine learning methods continue to be applied to a broad scope of
problems in the physical sciences, uncertainty quantification is becoming
correspondingly more important for their robust application. Uncertainty aware
machine learning methods have been used in select applications, but largely for
scalar properties. In this work, we showcase an exemplary study in which neural
network ensembles are used to predict the X-ray absorption spectra of small
molecules, as well as their point-wise uncertainty, from local atomic
environments. We not only obtain quantitative accuracy in our predictions, but
also accurately quantify the vector uncertainty (and most importantly, an upper
bound on the expected error) in the predictions of our ensembles, allowing a
user to quickly detect when model fails. Our models can be generalized to
larger molecules than those used for training, and also successfully track
uncertainty due to random distortions in test molecules. While we demonstrate
this workflow on a specific example, ensemble learning is completely general,
and could have significant impact on ML-enabled forward modeling of molecular
and materials properties.

<h3>Flow induced rigidity percolation in shear thickening suspensions</h3>

<br>
Discontinuous shear thickening (DST) is associated with a sharp rise of a
suspension's viscosity with increasing applied shear rate. A key signature of
DST, highlighted in recent studies, is the very large fluctuations of the
measured stress as the suspension thickens. A clear link between
microstructural development and the dramatic increase of the stress
fluctuations has not been established yet. To identify the microstructural
underpinnings of this behavior, we perform simulations of sheared dense
suspensions. By analyzing particle contact networks, we identify a subset of
constrained particles that contribute directly to the rapid rise in viscosity
and the large stress fluctuations. Indeed, both phenomena can be explained by
the growth and percolation of constrained particle networks -- in direct
analogy to rigidity percolation. A finite size scaling analysis confirms this
is a percolation phenomenon and allows us to estimate the critical exponents.
Our findings reveal the specific microstructural transition that underlies DST.

<h3>Quantum transport in dispersionless electronic bands</h3>

<br>
Flat electronic bands are counterintuitive: with the electron velocity
vanishing, our conventional notions of quasiparticle transport are no longer
valid. We here study the quantum transport in the generalized families of
perfectly flat bands [PRB 105, L241102 (2022)], and find that while the
conventional contributions indeed vanish, the quantum-geometric contribution
gives rise to the enhanced electronic transport. This contribution is connected
to the Wannier orbital quantization in the perfectly flat bands, and is present
only for geometrically-nontrivial bands (for example, flat Chern bands). We
find similar expressions for thermal conductance, thermoelectric response, and
superfluid weight in the flat bands. In particular, we report the anomalous
thermopower associated with flat topological bands reaching values as large as
$\frac{k_B}{e}\ln 2$$\approx$60 $\mu$V/k, the quantum unit of thermopower, not
expected in conventional dispersive bands.

<h3>Spin dynamics of the generalized quantum spin compass chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00357</a>
<br>
<i>Pontus Laurell, Gonzalo Alvarez, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
We calculate the dynamical spin structure factor of the generalized
spin-$1/2$ compass spin chain using the density matrix renormalization group.
The model, also known as the twisted Kitaev spin chain, was recently proposed
to be relevant for the description of the spin chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$. It
features bond-dependent interactions and interpolates between an Ising chain
and a one-dimensional variant of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model. The structure
factor, in turn, is found to interpolate from gapped and non-dispersive in the
Ising limit to gapless with non-trivial continua in the Kitaev limit. In
particular, the component of the structure factor perpendicular to the Ising
directions changes abruptly at the Kitaev point into a dispersionless continuum
due to the emergence of an extensive groundstate degeneracy. We show this
continuum is consistent with analytical Jordan-Wigner results. We also discuss
implications for future inelastic scattering experiments and applications to
materials, particularly CoNb$_2$O$_6$.

We discuss differences and similarities between variational Monte Carlo
approaches that use conventional and artificial neural network
parameterizations of the ground-state wave function for systems of fermions. We
focus on a relatively shallow neural-network architectures, the so called
restricted Boltzmann machine, and discuss unsupervised learning algorithms that
are suitable to model complicated many-body correlations. We analyze the
strengths and weaknesses of conventional and neural-network wave functions by
solving various circular quantum-dots systems. Results for up to 90 electrons
are presented and particular emphasis is placed on how to efficiently implement
these methods on homogeneous and heterogeneous high-performance computing
facilities.

<h3>Nonlinear features of the superconductor--ferromagnet--superconductor  $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction in ferromagnetic resonance region</h3>

<br>
<i>Aliasghar Janalizadeh, Ilhom R. Rahmonov, Sara A. Abdelmoneim, Yury M. Shukrinov, Mohammad R. Kolahchi</i>
<br>
We demonstrate the manifestations of the nonlinear features in magnetic
dynamics and IV-characteristics of the $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction in the
ferromagnetic resonance region. We show that at small values of system
parameters, namely, damping, spin-orbit interaction, and Josephson to magnetic
energy ratio, the magnetic dynamics is reduced to the dynamics of the scalar
Duffing oscillator, driven by the Josephson oscillations. The role of
increasing superconducting current in the resonance region is clarified.
Shifting of the ferromagnetic resonant frequency and the reversal of its
damping dependence due to nonlinearity are demonstrated by the full
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Josephson system of equations, and in its different
approximations. Finally, we demonstrate the negative differential resistance in
the IV--characteristics, and its correlation with the foldover effect.

<h3>Nonlinear optical birefringence in Li2SO4-MgO-P2O5 amorphous  system-influence of Cu ions</h3>

<br>
Li2SO4-MgO-P2O5 glasses doped with varied contents of CuO (from 0- 1.0 mol%)
were prepared. The optical birefringence induced by a High Q-2 femtosecond
pulsed laser is explored as a function of copper oxide concentration in these
glasses. The magnitude of the light-induced birefringence exhibited a gradual
decrease with the increase of copper oxide content. The observed behavior is
discussed in terms of polymerization of the glass network, the degree of which
rises with concentration of Cu+ ions occupying Td sites in the glass matrix.
However, the samples containing low content of CuO are dominated by Cu2+ ions
that act as modifiers and induce structural imperfections by breaking of P-O-S
bonds. Accordingly, the samples mixed with lower content of CuO are more
favorable for inducing higher magnitudes of the optical birefringence. This
conclusion is corroborated by results of electrical conductivity, positron
annihilation and ultrasonic measurements.

<h3>Metal-organic kagome systems as candidates to study spin liquids, spin  ice or the quantum anomalous Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Adam Hassan Denawi, Xavier Bouju, Mathieu Abel, Johannes Richter, Roland Hayn</i>
<br>
We present the results of first-principle calculations using the Vienna
Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) for a new class of organometallics labeled
TM3C6O6 (TM =Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) in the form of planar,
two-dimensional, periodic free-standing layers. These materials, which can be
produced by on-surface coordination on metallic surfaces, have a kagome lattice
of TM ions. Calculating the structural properties, we show that all considered
materials have local magnetic moments in the ground state, but four of them
(with Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) show spin-crossover behavior by changing the lattice
constant, which could be valuable for possible epitaxy routes on various
substrates. Surprisingly, we find a very large richness of electronic and
magnetic properties, qualifying these materials as highly promising
metal-organic topological quantum materials. We find semi-conductors with
nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings for V,
and Sc and Cr, respectively, being of potential interest to study spin ice or
spin liquids on the 2D kagome lattice. Other TM ion systems combine AFM
couplings with metallic behavior (Ti, Fe and Ni) or are ferromagnetic kagome
metals like Cu3C6O6 with symmetry protected Weyl crossings at the Fermi
surface. For the latter compound, the spin orbit coupling is shown to be
responsible for small gaps which should allow the observation of the quantum
anomalous Hall effect (QAHE).

<h3>Backfolding at q but nesting at 2q in Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$</h3>

<br>
Charge Density Waves (CDW) are commonly associated with the presence of
near-Fermi level states which are separated from others, or "nested", by a
wavector of $\mathbf{q}$. Here we use Angle-Resolved Photo Emission
Spectroscopy (ARPES) on the CDW material Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ and identify a total
absence of any plausible nesting of states at the primary CDW wavevector
$\mathbf{q}$. Nevertheless we observe spectral intensity on replicas of the
hole-like valence bands, shifted by a wavevector of $\mathbf{q}$, which appears
with the CDW transition. In contrast, we find that there is a possible nesting
at $\mathbf{2q}$, and associate the characters of these bands with the known
atomic modulations at $\mathbf{2q}$. Our comprehensive electronic structure
perspective shows that the CDW-like transition of Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ is unique,
with the primary wavevector $\mathbf{q}$ being unrelated to any low-energy
states, but suggests that the modulation at $\mathbf{2q}$, which does plausibly
connect low-energy states, might be more important for the overall energetics
of the problem.

<h3>Data-mining of In-Situ TEM Experiments: on the Dynamics of Dislocations  in CoCrFeMnNi Alloys</h3>

<br>
High entropy alloys are a class of materials with many significant
improvements in terms of mechanical properties as compared to ``classical''
alloys. The corresponding structure-property relations are not yet entirely
clear, but it is commonly believed that the good mechanical performance is
strongly related to dislocation interactions with the complex energy landscape
formed due to alloying. Although in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
allows high-resolution studies of the structure and dynamics of moving
dislocations and makes the local obstacle/energy ``landscape'' directly visible
in the geometry of dislocations; such observation, however, are merely
qualitative, and detailed three-dimensional analyses of the interaction between
dislocations and the energy landscape is still missing. In this work, we
utilized dislocations as ``probes'' for the local energy maxima which play the
role of pinning points for the dislocation movement. To this end, we developed
a unique data-mining approach that can perform coarse-grained spatio-temporal
analysis, making ensemble averaging of a considerable number of snapshots
possible. We investigate the effect of pinning points on the dislocation
gliding behavior of CoCrFeMnNi alloy during in-situ TEM straining and find that
(i) the pinning point strength changes when dislocations glide through and (ii)
the pinning point moves along the direction close to the Burgers vector
direction. Our data-mining method can be applied to dislocation motion in
general, making it a useful tool for dislocation research.

<h3>Phase diagrams of lattice models on Cayley tree and chandelier network:  a review</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00480</a>
<br>
<i>H. Akın</i>
<br>
The main purpose of this review paper is to give systematically all the known
results on phase diagrams corresponding to lattice models (Ising and Potts) on
Cayley tree (or Bethe lattice) and chandelier networks. A detailed survey of
various modelling applications of lattice models is reported. By using
Vannimenus's approach, the recursive equations of Ising and Potts models
associated to a given Hamiltonian on the Cayley tree are presented and
analyzed. The corresponding phase diagrams with programming codes in different
programming languages are plotted. To detect the phase transitions in the
modulated phase, we investigate in detail the actual variation of the
wave-vector $q$ with temperature and the Lyapunov exponent associated with the
trajectory of our current recursive system. We determine the transition between
commensurate ($C$) and incommensurate ($I$) phases by means of the Lyapunov
exponents, wave-vector, and strange attractor for a comprehensive comparison.
We survey the dynamical behavior of the Ising model on the chandelier network.
We examine the phase diagrams of the Ising model corresponding to a given
Hamiltonian on a new type of "Cayley-tree-like lattice", such as triangular,
rectangular, pentagonal chandelier networks (lattices). Moreover, several open
problems are discussed.

<br>
We have revisited the composition dependence of principal properties of
liquid water-DMSO mixtures by using the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics
computer simulations. A set of non-polarizable semi-flexible models for the
DMSO molecule combined with the TIP4P-2005 and TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water models
is considered. We restrict calculations to atmospheric pressure, 0.1013 MPa,
and room temperature, 298.15 K. Composition trends of density, excess mixing
volume and excess mixing enthalpy, partial molar volumes and partial molar
enthalpies of species, apparent molar volumes are reported. Besides, we explore
composition trends of the self-diffusion of species, the static dielectric
constant and the surface tension. Evolution of the microscopic structure of the
mixture with composition is analyzed in terms of radial distributions
functions, coordination numbers and the fractions of hydrogen-bonded molecules.
We intend to capture the peculiarities of mixing the species in the mixture
upon the DMSO molar fraction and the anomalous behaviors, if manifested in each
of the properties under study. The quality of several combinations of the
models for species is evaluated in detail to establish the possibility of
necessary improvements.

The topological property of a system is a static property in general. For
instance, the topological edge state is observed by measuring the local density
of states. In this work we propose a system whose topological property is only
revealed by dynamics. As a concrete example, we explore a nonlinear dynamical
topological phase transition revealed by a quench dynamics of a Cooper-pair box
array connected with capacitors. It is described by coupled nonlinear
differential equations due to the Josephson effect. It is trivial as far as the
static system is concerned. However, the wave propagation induced by the quench
dynamics demonstrates a rich topological phase diagram in terms of the strength
of the input.

<h3>Reconciling $π$ phase shift in Josephson junction experiments with  even-parity superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>

<br>
<i>Austin W. Lindquist, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<br>
The superconducting state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ was once thought to be a leading
candidate for $p$-wave superconductivity. A constant Knight shift below the
transition temperature provided evidence for spin-triplet pairing, and a $\pi$
phase shift observed in Josephson junction tunneling experiments suggested
odd-parity pairing, both of which are described by $p$-wave states. However,
with recent experiments observing a significant decrease in the Knight shift
below the transition temperature, signifying a spin-singlet state, the
odd-parity results are left to be reconciled. In this work, we show that an
even-parity pseudospin-singlet state originating from interorbital pairing via
spin-orbit coupling can explain what has been assumed to be evidence for an
odd-parity state. In the presence of small mirror symmetry breaking,
interorbital pairing is uniquely capable of displaying odd-parity
characteristics required to explain these experimental results. Further, we
discuss how these experiments may be used to differentiate the proposed pairing
states of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

<h3>SWENet: a physics-informed deep neural network (PINN) for shear wave  elastography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00556</a>

<br>
Shear wave elastography (SWE) enables the measurement of elastic properties
of soft materials, including soft tissues, in a non-invasive manner and finds
broad applications in a variety of disciplines. The state-of-the-art SWE
methods commercialized in various instruments rely on the measurement of shear
wave velocities to infer material parameters and have relatively low resolution
and accuracy for inhomogeneous soft materials due to the complexity of wave
fields. In the present study, we overcome this challenge by proposing a
physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based SWE (SWENet) method considering
the merits of PINN in solving an inverse problem. The spatial variation of
elastic properties of inhomogeneous materials has been defined in governing
equations, which are encoded in PINN as loss functions. Snapshots of wave
motion inside a local region have been used to train the neural networks, and
during this course, the spatial distribution of elastic properties is inferred
simultaneously. Both finite element simulations and tissue-mimicking phantom
experiments have been performed to validate the method. Our results show that
the shear moduli of soft composites consisting of matrix and inclusions of
several millimeters in cross-section dimensions with either regular or
irregular geometries can be identified with good accuracy. The advantages of
the SWENet over conventional SWE methods consist of using more features of the
wave motion in inhomogeneous soft materials and enabling seamless integration
of multi-source data in the inverse analysis. Given the advantages of the
reported method, it may find applications including but not limited to
mechanical characterization of artificial soft biomaterials, imaging elastic
properties of nerves in vivo, and differentiating small malignant tumors from
benign ones by quantitatively measuring their distinct stiffnesses.

<br>
Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices offer highly tunable platforms,
potentially suitable for quantum technology applications, that have been
intensively studied in the past decade. Here we establish that measurements of
the superconductor-to-normal transition originating from Joule heating provide
a powerful spectroscopical tool to characterize such hybrid devices.
Concretely, we apply this technique to junctions in full-shell Al-InAs
nanowires in the Little-Parks regime and obtain detailed information of each
lead independently and in a single measurement, including differences in the
superconducting coherence lengths of the leads, inhomogeneous covering of the
epitaxial shell, and the inverse superconducting proximity effect; all-in-all
constituting a unique fingerprint of each device and highlighting the large
variability present in these systems. Besides the practical uses, our work also
underscores the importance of heating in hybrid devices, an effect that is
often overlooked.

Crystal-graph attention networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools
for the prediction of thermodynamic stability and materials properties from
unrelaxed crystal structures. Previous networks trained on two million
materials exhibited, however, strong biases originating from underrepresented
chemical elements and structural prototypes in the available data. We tackled
this issue computing additional data to provide better balance across both
chemical and crystal-symmetry space. Crystal-graph networks trained with this
new data show unprecedented generalization accuracy, and allow for reliable,
accelerated exploration of the whole space of inorganic compounds. We applied
this universal network to perform machine-learning assisted high-throughput
materials searches including 2500 binary and ternary structure prototypes and
spanning about 1 billion compounds. After validation using density-functional
theory, we uncover in total 19512 additional materials on the convex hull of
thermodynamic stability and ~150000 compounds with a distance of less than 50
meV/atom from the hull. Combining again machine learning and ab-initio methods,
we finally evaluate the discovered materials for applications as
superconductors, superhard materials, and we look for candidates with large gap
deformation potentials, finding several compounds with extreme values of these
properties.

<h3>Two-dimensional miscible-immiscible supersolid and droplet crystal state  in a homonuclear dipolar bosonic mixture</h3>

<i>Soumyadeep Halder, Subrata Das, Sonjoy Majumder</i>
<br>
The recent realization of binary dipolar BEC [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 213601
(2018)] opens new exciting aspects for studying quantum droplets and
supersolids in a binary mixture. Motivated by this experiment, we study
groundstate phases and dynamics of a $^{164}$Dy-$^{164}$Dy mixture. Dipolar
bosonic mixture exhibits qualitatively novel and rich physics. Relying on the
three-dimensional numerical simulations in the extended Gross-Pitaevskii
framework, we unravel the groundstate phase diagrams and characterize different
groundstate phases. The emergent phases include both miscible and immiscible
single droplet (SD), multiple droplets (MD), supersolid (SS), and superfluid
(SF) states. More intriguing mixed groundstates may occur for an imbalanced
binary mixture, including a combination of SS-SF, SS-MD, and SS-SS phases.
Following linear quenches of intra-species scattering lengths across the
aforementioned phases, we monitor the dynamical formation of supersolid
clusters and droplet lattices. Also, by tuning the inter-species scattering
length, we observed the dynamical transition from a miscible MD state to an
immiscible MD state with multiple domains formed along the axial direction.
Although we have demonstrated the results for a Dy-Dy mixture and for a
specific parameter range of intra-species and inter-species scattering lengths,
our results are generally valid for other dipolar mixtures and may become an
important benchmark for future experimental scenarios.

We report density functional theory plus exact diagonalization of the
multi-orbital Anderson impurity model calculations for the Co adatom on the top
of Cu(001) surface. For the Co atom $d$-shell occupation $n_d \approx$ 8, a
singlet many-body ground state and Kondo resonance are found, when the
spin-orbit coupling is included in the calculations. The differential
conductance is evaluated in a good agreement with the scanning tuneling
microscopy measurements. The results illustrate the essential role which the
spin-orbit coupling is playing in a formation of Kondo singlet for the
multi-orbital impurity in low dimensions.

<h3>Optimizing the Accuracy of Viscoelastic Characterization with AFM  Force-Distance Experiments in the Time and Frequency Domains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00617" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00617</a>
<br>
<i>Marshall R. McCraw, Berkin Uluutku, Halen D. Solomon, Megan S. Anderson, Kausik Sarkar, Santiago D. Solares</i>
<br>
We demonstrate that the method of characterizing viscoelastic materials with
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) by fitting analytical models to force-distance
(FD) curves often yields conflicting and physically unrealistic results.
Because this method involves specifying a constitutive time-dependent
viscoelastic model and then fitting said model to the experimental data, we
show that the inconsistencies in this method are due to a lack of sensitivity
of the model with respect to its parameters. Using approaches from information
theory, this lack of sensitivity can be interpreted as a narrowed distribution
of information which is obtained from the experiment. Furthermore, the
equivalent representation of the problem in the frequency domain, achieved via
modified Fourier transformation, offers an enhanced sensitivity through a
widening of the information distribution. Using these distributions, we then
define restrictions for the timescales which can be reliably accessed in both
the time and frequency domains, which leads to the conclusion that the analysis
of experiments in the time domain can frequently lead to inaccuracies. Finally,
we provide an example where we use these restrictions as a guide to optimally
design an experiment to characterize a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer
sample.

<h3>Inability of a graph neural network heuristic to outperform greedy  algorithms in solving combinatorial optimization problems like Max-Cut</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00623</a>
<br>
<i>Stefan Boettcher</i>
<br>
In Nature Machine Intelligence 4, 367 (2022), Schuetz et al provide a scheme
to employ graph neural networks (GNN) as a heuristic to solve a variety of
classical, NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. It describes how the
network is trained on sample instances and the resulting GNN heuristic is
evaluated applying widely used techniques to determine its ability to succeed.
Clearly, the idea of harnessing the powerful abilities of such networks to
``learn'' the intricacies of complex, multimodal energy landscapes in such a
hands-off approach seems enticing. And based on the observed performance, the
heuristic promises to be highly scalable, with a computational cost linear in
the input size $n$, although there is likely a significant overhead in the
pre-factor due to the GNN itself. However, closer inspection shows that the
reported results for this GNN are only minutely better than those for gradient
descent and get outperformed by a greedy algorithm, for example, for Max-Cut.
The discussion also highlights what I believe are some common misconceptions in
the evaluations of heuristics.

<h3>Topological adiabatic dynamics in classical mass-spring chains with  clamps</h3>

<br>
<i>Atushi Tanaka</i>
<br>
The path dependence of adiabatic evolution in classical integrable systems
with multiple degrees of freedom is examined. It is shown that different paths
may adiabatically transport a normal mode of a mass-spring chain with clamps to
different normal modes even when the paths share the endpoints. Accordingly, an
adiabatic cycle works as a mode pump, which amounts to the breakdown of
single-valuedness of action variables, i.e., the adiabatic invariants, in the
adiabatic parameter space. Another topological pump for degenerate localized
modes induced by clamps is also explained.

<h3>Inference in gated first-passage processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00678</a>
<br>

<br>
The first-passage time of a stochastic process provides invaluable insight
into its fundamental properties. However, imperfect observation conditions,
which is a form of gating, often renders the process intermittently observable,
such that the exact first-passage instance might be missed. In such cases, the
measured detection times differ from the first-passage times of interest, as
e.g., happens in imperfect chemical reactions and when tracking photoblinking
particles. Motivated by the inference challenge posed by these real-life
situations we develop a universal scheme for the inference of first-passage
times from the detection times of gated first-passage processes. We further
provide a way to infer underlying model-based parameters (e.g., the diffusion
coefficient in the case of diffusion), and even the gating rates themselves via
the hitherto overlooked short-time regime of the gated detection times. The
power of our approach is illustrated with examples.

<h3>Comment on "Absence versus Presence of Dissipative Quantum Phase  Transition in Josephson Junctions''</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00742" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00742</a>

<i>Théo Sépulcre, Serge Florens, Izak Snyman</i>
<br>
In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 087001, (2022)], Masuki, Sudo,
Oshikawa, and Ashida studied a Josephson junction, with Josephson energy
$E_{\rm J}$ and charging energy $E_{\rm C}$, shunted by an ohmic transmission
line with conductance $\alpha (2e)^2/h$. Their model includes a realistic high
frequency cutoff of order $\alpha E_c$, that is typically smaller than the
plasma frequency $W$. The authors present a phase diagram showing surprising
features, not anticipated in the established literature [eg. Sch\"on and
Zaikin, Phys. Reports 198, 237, (1990)]. For $E_{\rm J}/E_{\rm C}$ above a
certain value, they find that the junction remains superconducting for all
$\alpha$, while below this value, they find that the insulating phase leads to
re-entrant superconductivity at small $\alpha$. In this Comment, we show that
their Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) implementation is uncontrolled, and
that there is no evidence for the re-entrant superconductivity in the phase
diagram presented in Fig. 1a of PRL 129, 087001.

<h3>Electron-phonon coupling and spin fluctuations in the Ising  superconductor NbSe$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
Ising superconductivity, observed experimentally in NbSe$_{2}$ and similar
materials, has generated tremendous interest. Recently, attention was called to
the possible role that spin fluctuations (SF) play in this phenomenon, in
addition to the dominant electron-phonon coupling (EPC); the possibility of a
predominantly-triplet state was discussed and led to a conjecture of viable
singlet-triplet Leggett oscillations. However, these hypotheses have not been
put to a quantitative test. In this paper, we report first principle
calculations of the EPC and also estimate coupling with SF, including full
momentum dependence. We find that: (1) EPC is strongly anisotropic, largely
coming from the K-K' scattering, and therefore excludes triplet symmetry even
as an excited state; (2) superconductivity is substantially weakened by SF, but
anisotropy remains as above; and, (3) we do find the possibility of a Leggett
mode, not in a singlet-triplet but in an $s_{++}$ - $s_\pm$ channel.

<h3>Berry curvature, spin Hall effect and nonlinear optical response in  moiré transition metal dichalcogenides heterostructure</h3>

<i>Jin-Xin Hu, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law</i>
<br>
Recently, the spin Hall effect was experimentally observed in the AB stacked
MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayer. In this work, we perform a systematic study of
the Berry curvature effects in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenides
heterostructure. We point out that the moir\'{e} potential on the remote
conduction band would induce a sizable periodic pseudo-magnetic field (PMF) on
the valence band. This periodic PMF enables net Berry curvature flux in each
valley. Due to the spin-valley locking, the PMF can thus cause the spin Hall
effect observed in the experiment. Moreover, we propose that the
valley-contrasting Berry curvature distribution induced by the PMF can be
probed through nonlinear optical responses. Our work deepens the understanding
of the Berry curvature effects and their relation with periodic PMFs in the
moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenides heterostructure.

<h3>Delocalization of topological surface states by diagonal disorder in  nodal loop semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00769</a>
<br>
<i>João Silva, Miguel A. N. Araújo, Miguel Gonçalves, Pedro Ribeiro, Eduardo V. Castro</i>
<br>
The effect of Anderson diagonal disorder on the topological surface
(``drumhead'') states of a Weyl nodal loop semimetal is addressed. Since
diagonal disorder breaks chiral symmetry, a winding number cannot be defined.
Seen as a perturbation, the weak random potential mixes the clean exponentially
localized drumhead states of the semimetal, thereby producing two effects: (i)
the algebraic decay of the surface states into the bulk; (ii) a broadening of
the low energy density of surface states of the open system due to degeneracy
lifting. This behavior persists with increasing disorder, up to the bulk
semimetal-to-metal transition at the critical disorder $W_{c}$. Above $W_{c}$,
the surface states hybridize with bulk states and become extended into the
bulk.

<h3>Early stages of polycrystalline diamond deposition: Laser reflectance at  substrates with growing nanodiamonds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00776" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00776</a>
<br>
<i>David Vázquez-Cortés, Stoffel D. Janssens, Burhannudin Sutisna, Eliot Fried</i>
<br>
The chemical vapor deposition of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) films is
typically done on substrates seeded with diamond nanoparticles. Specular laser
reflectance and a continuous film model have been used to monitor the thickness
of these films during their deposition. However, most seeds are isolated during
the early stages of the deposition, which questions the utility of applying
such a continuous film model for monitoring deposition before film formation.
In this work, we present a model based on the Rayleigh theory of scattering for
laser reflectance at substrates with growing nanodiamonds to capture the early
stages of PCD deposition. The reflectance behavior predicted by our model
differs from that of a continuous film, which is well-described by the
continuous film model. This difference enlarges as the seed density used in our
model decreases. We verify this trend experimentally by depositing diamond
under identical conditions on substrates with various seed densities. A
relation derived from our model is used to fit reflectance data from which seed
densities are obtained that are proportional to those found with electron
microscopy. We also show that relying on the continuous film model for
describing the early stages of deposition can result in falsely deducing the
existence of incubation, and that the continuous film model can be used safely
beyond the early stages of deposition. Based on these findings, we delineate a
robust method for obtaining growth rates and incubation periods from
reflectance measurements. This work may also advance the general understanding
of nanoparticle growth and formation.

The experimental measurement of correlation functions and critical exponents
in disordered systems is key to testing renormalization group (RG) predictions.
We mechanically unzip single DNA hairpins with optical tweezers, an
experimental realization of the diffusive motion of a particle in a
one-dimensional random force field, known as the Sinai model. We measure the
unzipping forces $F_w$ as a function of the trap position $w$ in equilibrium,
and calculate the force correlator $\Delta_m(w)$, its amplitude, and
correlation length, finding agreement with theoretical predictions. We study
the universal scaling properties by varying the trap strength $m^2$.
Fluctuations of the position of the base pair at the unzipping junction $u$
scale as $u \sim m^{-\zeta}$, with a roughness exponent $ \zeta=1.34\pm0.06$,
in agreement with the analytical prediction $\zeta = \frac{4}{3}$. Our study
provides a single-molecule test of the functional RG approach for disordered
elastic systems in equilibrium.

<br>
<i>P.Nieves, S.Arapan, S.H. Zhang, A.P. Kądzielawa, R.F. Zhang, D. Legut</i>
<br>
We present a methodology to compute the isotropic magnetoelastic constants
and isotropic magnetostrictive coefficients associated to the exchange
magnetostriction. This method is implemented in the new version of the program
MAELAS (v3.0), so that it can be easily used to obtain these quantities by
first-principles calculations and classical spin-lattice models in an automated
way. One important advantage of this approach is that it can compute the
spontaneous volume magnetostriction avoiding the critical problem of the
difficult first-principles calculation of the equilibrium volume at the
paramagnetic state. This new version also computes the isotropic and
anisotropic contributions to spontaneous volume magnetostriction. Moreover, the
results are printed using the universal notation proposed by E. du Tremolet de
Lacheisserie which is valid for any crystal symmetry. The presented
computational tool might be helpful to design magnetic materials for
technological applications with the desired volume magnetostriction via
high-throughput screening approaches.

A new mechanism leading to a switchable polarization in a ferroelectric
domain wall (DW) is proposed. A biquadratic coupling of the primary order
parameter and its gradient triggers the phase transition in the DW with
softening of the local polar mode and anomalous increase of the susceptibility
at the phase transition temperature $T_{DW}$. This mechanism describes the
origin and properties of the polar Bloch and antipolar N\'eel components in the
$180^\circ$-DW of PbTiO$_3$, which were recently reported from first-principles

<h3>Low and high-energy localization landscapes for tight-binding  Hamiltonians in 2D lattices</h3>

<i>Luis A. Razo-López, Geoffroy J. Aubry, Marcel Filoche, Fabrice Mortessagne</i>
<br>
Localization of electronic wave functions in modern two-dimensional (2D)
materials such as graphene can impact drastically their transport and magnetic
properties. The recent localization landscape (LL) theory has brought many
tools and theoretical results to understand such localization phenomena in the
continuous setting, but with very few extensions so far to the discrete realm
or to tight-binding Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show how this approach can
be extended to almost all known 2D~lattices, and propose a systematic way of
designing LL even for higher dimension. We demonstrate in detail how this LL
theory works and predicts accurately not only the location, but also the
energies of localized eigenfunctions in the low and high energy regimes for the
honeycomb and hexagonal lattices, making it a highly promising tool for
investigating the role of disorder in these materials.

<h3>Portfolio optimization with discrete simulated annealing</h3>

<br>
<i>Álvaro Rubio-García, Juan José García-Ripoll, Diego Porras</i>
<br>
Portfolio optimization is an important process in finance that consists in
finding the optimal asset allocation that maximizes expected returns while
minimizing risk. When assets are allocated in discrete units, this is a
combinatorial optimization problem that can be addressed by quantum and
quantum-inspired algorithms. In this work we present an integer simulated
annealing method to find optimal portfolios in the presence of discretized
convex and non-convex cost functions. Our algorithm can deal with large size
portfolios with hundreds of assets. We introduce a performance metric, the time
to target, based on a lower bound to the cost function obtained with the
continuous relaxation of the combinatorial optimization problem. This metric
allows us to quantify the time required to achieve a solution with a given
quality. We carry out numerical experiments and we benchmark the algorithm in
two situations: (i) Monte Carlo instances are started at random, and (ii) the
algorithm is warm-started with an initial instance close to the continuous
relaxation of the problem. We find that in the case of warm-starting with
convex cost functions, the time to target does not grow with the size of the
optimization problem, so discretized versions of convex portfolio optimization
problems are not hard to solve using classical resources. We have applied our
method to the problem of re-balancing in the presence of non-convex transaction
costs, and we have found that our algorithm can efficiently minimize those
terms.

<h3>An image processing pipeline for in-situ dynamic X-ray imaging of  directional solidification of metal alloys in thin cells</h3>

<br>
<i>Mihails Birjukovs, Natalia Shevchenko, Sven Eckert</i>
<br>
We present an image processing algorithm developed for quantitative analysis
of directional solidification of metal alloys in thin cells using X-ray
imaging. Our methodology allows to identify the fluid volume, fluid channels
and cavities, and to separate them from the solidified structures. It also
allows morphological analysis within the solid fraction, including automatic
decomposition into dominant grains by orientation and connectivity. In
addition, the interplay between solidification and convection can be studied by
characterizing convection plumes in the fluid, and solute concentrations above
the developing solidification front. The image filters used enable the
developed code (open-source) to work reliably even for single images with low
signal-to-noise ratio, low contrast-to-noise ratio, and low image resolution.
This is demonstrated by applying the code to several dynamic in situ X-ray
imaging experiments with a solidifying gallium-indium alloy in a thin cell.
Grain (and global) dendrite orientation statistics, convective plume
parameterization, etc. can be obtained from the code output. The limitations of
the presented approach are also explained.

<h3>Superscreening and polarization control in confined ferroelectric  nematic liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00886" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00886</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Caimi, Giovanni Nava, Susanna Fuschetto, Liana Lucchetti, Petra Paiè, Roberto Osellame, Xi Chen, Noel A. Clark, Matthew Glaser, Tommaso Bellini</i>
<br>
The combination of large spontaneous polarization and fluidity makes the
newly discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phase (NF) responsive
to electric fields in ways that have no counterpart in other materials. We
probe this sensitive field response by confining a NF fluid in microchannels
that connect electrodes through straight and curved paths. We find that by
applying electric fields as low as E c.a. 0.5 V/mm, the NF phase orders with
its polarization smoothly following the winding paths of the channels even when
oriented antiparallel to the line connecting positive to negative electrodes,
implying analogous behavior of the electric field. Upon inversion of E, the
polar order undergoes a complex multistage switching process dominated by
electrostatic interactions. Multistage polarization switching dynamics is also
found in numerical simulations of a quasi-2D continuum model of NF liquid
crystals in microchannels, which also clarify the conditions under which the
electric field is guided by the microchannels. Experiments and theory indicate
that all observations are direct consequences of the prompt effective screening
of electric field components normal to the channel walls. This electric
"superscreening" effect emerges as a distinctive property of the NF phase,
capable of inducing conditions in which both the polarization and the electric
field are guided by microchannels.

We investigate the coupled magnetization dynamics in heterostructures of a
single crystal of the chiral magnet $\mathrm{Cu_2OSeO_3}$ (CSO) and a
polycrystalline ferromagnet $\mathrm{NiFe}$ (Py) thin film using broadband
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) at cryogenic temperatures. We observe the
excitation of a hybrid mode (HM) below the helimagnetic transition temperature
of CSO. This HM is attributed to the spin dynamics at the CSO/Py interface. We
study the HM by measuring its resonance frequencies for in plane rotations of
the external magnetic field. We find that the HM exhibits dominantly four-fold
anisotropy, in contrast to the FMR of CSO and Py.

Anharmonic oscillator plays important roles in two distant area, one is in
the classical mechanics in which it exhibits renormalization of the bare
frequency, and anther is in the statistical mechanics in which it causes a
correction to the vibrational contribution of the heat capacity of an ideal gas

of the bare frequency share a common characteristic quantity due to the higher

<br>
<i>Kyle J. Ray, Alexander B. Boyd, Giacomo Guarnieri, James P. Crutchfield</i>
<br>
The persistent currents required to maintain a nonequilibrium steady state
(NESS) come at a thermodynamic cost. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs)
express this by bounding the scaled variance of any NESS current by functions
of the average entropy production. The relations have been refined to the
tightest possible average entropy bound on thermodynamic current fluctuations,
which can be achieved by a specifically designed NESS that produces a highly
peaked entropy distribution. We extend this to any time-symmetrically
controlled computation, including any NESS, by deriving the exact form of the
current with minimum scaled variance. This physically-realizable current is a
function of the entropy production, not on average, but for each system
trajectory. Evaluating the current's variance leads to the Thermodynamic
Uncertainty Theorem (TUT): an equality relating minimum variance to the entropy
distribution. The TUT dictates that, beyond the average, the entropy
distribution's higher moments have a significant effect on current variance. In
this way, one can interpolate between previously-established bounds and
identify the TURs most relevant in different nonequilibrium regimes.

<h3>Phase-dependent thermoelectricity in short Josephson junctions at  helical edge states</h3>

<br>
<i>Paramita Dutta</i>
<br>
Thermoelectric currents in Josephson junctions are tunable by the
superconducting phase difference $\phi$ across junctions. We show that the
phase-dependent thermoelectric effect is achievable in short Josephson
junctions with two normal metal leads attached at opposite ends, formed at
helical edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). For all
finite phases, an asymmetry appears around the zero energy in the transmission
spectra except for $\phi\!=\!n\phi_0$, where $n$ is a half-integer and $\phi_0$
is the flux quantum. This asymmetry plays a key role in inducing the charge and
heat current through the thermally biased junction. The finite-size topological
junction hosts topological Andreev bound states, tunable by the phase, which
mediate the current through the junction. However, the current amplitudes are
sensitive to the junction size. The optimization condition for a good
thermoelectric junction is achieved when the superconductors are of the order
of coherence length. The present work demonstrates that TI-based short
Josephson junctions are promising systems for superconductor-based
phase-dependent thermoelectricity.

<br>
Coordinated rotational motion is an intriguing, yet still elusive mode of
collective cell migration, which is relevant in pathological and morphogenetic
processes. Most of the studies on this topic have been carried out on confined
epithelial cells. The driver of collective rotation in such conditions has not
been clearly elucidated, although it has been speculated that spatial
confinement can play an essential role in triggering cell rotation. Here, we
study the growth of epithelial cell colonies freely expanding (i.e., with no
physical constraints) on the surface of cell culture plates, a case which has
received scarce attention in the literature. We find that coordinated cell
rotation spontaneously occurs in cell clusters in the free growth regime, thus
implying that cell confinement is not necessary to elicit collective rotation
as previously suggested. The collective rotation was size and shape dependent:
a highly coordinated disk-like rotation was found in small cell clusters with a
round shape, while collective rotation was suppressed in large irregular cell
clusters generated by merging of different clusters in the course of their
growth. The angular motion was persistent in the same direction, although
clockwise and anticlockwise rotations were equally likely to occur among
different cell clusters. Radial cell velocity was low as compared to the
angular velocity. A clear difference in morphology was observed between cells
at the periphery and the ones in the core of the clusters, the former being
more elongated and spread out as compared to the latter. Overall, our results
provide the first quantitative and systematic evidence that coordinated cell
rotation does not require a spatial confinement and occurs spontaneously in
freely expanding epithelial cell colonies.

We examine the fundamental question whether a random discrete structure with
the minimal number of restrictions can converge to continuous metric space. We
study the geometrical properties such as the dimensionality and the curvature
emerging out of the connectivity properties of uniform random graphs. In
addition we introduce a simple evolution mechanism for the graph by removing
one edge per a fundamental quantum of time from an initially complete graph. We
show an exponential growth of the radius of the graph, that ends up in a random
structure with emergent approximate spatial dimension $D=3$ and zero curvature,
resembling a flat 3D manifold, that could describe the observed space in our
universe and some of its geometrical properties. In addition, we introduce a
generalized action for graphs based on physical quantities on different
subgraph structures that helps to recover the well-known properties of
spacetime as described in general relativity, like time dilation due to
gravity. Also, we show how various quantum mechanical concepts such as
generalized uncertainty principles based on the statistical fluctuations can
emerge from random discrete models. Moreover, our approach leads to a
unification of space and matter/energy, for which we propose a
mass-energy-space equivalence that leads to a way to transform between empty
space and matter/energy via the cosmological constant.

<br>
We initiate the recently proposed $\boldsymbol{w}$-ensemble one-particle
reduced density matrix functional theory ($\boldsymbol{w}$-RDMFT) by deriving
the first functional approximations and illustrate how excitation energies can
be calculated in practice. For this endeavour, we first study the symmetric
Hubbard dimer, constituting the building block of the Hubbard model, for which
we execute the Levy-Lieb constrained search. Second, due to the particular
suitability of $\boldsymbol{w}$-RDMFT for describing Bose-Einstein condensates,
we demonstrate three conceptually different approaches for deriving the
universal functional in a homogeneous Bose gas for arbitrary pair interaction
in the Bogoliubov regime. Remarkably, in both systems the gradient of the
functional is found to diverge repulsively at the boundary of the functional's
domain, extending the recently discovered Bose-Einstein condensation force to
excited states. Our findings highlight the physical relevance of the
generalized exclusion principle for fermionic and bosonic mixed states and the
curse of universality in functional theories.

<h3>Chaos synchronization in a BEC system using fuzzy logic controller</h3>

<br>
Since the presence of chaos in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems plays a
destructive role that can undermine the stability of the condensates,
controlling the chaos is of great importance for the creation of the BEC. In
this paper, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to synchronize the chaotic dynamics
of two identical master-slave BEC systems has been proposed. Unlike the
conventional approaches, where expert knowledge is directly used to construct
the fuzzy rules and membership functions, the fuzzy rules have been constructed
using Lyapunov stability theorem ensuring the synchronization process. The
effectiveness of the proposed controller has been demonstrated numerically.

The generalized van der Waals equation for anisotropic fluids in porous
media, proposed by the authors in previous works, is used to describe the
effect of porous media on the phase behavior of polypeptide solutions. By
introducing the temperature dependence for the depth of the potential well and
the geometric parameters of the spherocylinder, the main features of phase
behavior of the polypeptide poly ($\gamma$-benzyl-$L$-glutamate) (PBLG) in a
solution of dimethylformamide, including the existence of two nematic phases,
is reproduced. It is shown that the presence of a porous medium shifts the
phase diagram to the region of lower densities and lower temperatures.

<br>
Transition metal dichalcogenides are cheap and earth-abundant candidates for
the replacement of precious metals as catalyst materials. The electrocatalytic
activity of MoS2 displays rich behavior depending on several system specifics,
and fundamental insight on atomic-scale reaction mechanisms is necessary. Here,
we investigate the activation of the otherwise inert basal MoS2 plane with
respect to hydrogen evolution by transition-metal doping. We present
calculations of reaction and activation energy as a function of the electrode
potential under electrochemical conditions, i.e. in the presence of a solvent
and accounting for the constant electrode potential. The calculations are based
on searches for the relevant saddle points on the energy surface obtained from
density functional theory calculations corresponding to a given applied
voltage. 3d-metals and Pt-doping are found to enhance hydrogen adsorption onto
the basal plane by introducing electronic states within the band gap, and in
the most prominent cases (Co, Ni, Cu, Pt) doping is associated with local
symmetry breaking through stretching of the Mo-S bonds. The hydrogen evolution
reaction occurs via the Volmer and Heyrovsky pathways and the associated
reaction barriers display considerable voltage-dependence. The various dopants
give rise to a wide range in kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction.
Nickel appears to be the most promising dopant in terms of catalytic activity
under moderate negative applied voltage. However, the predicted catalytic
activity of the doped basal plane is still lower than what is indicated by
experiment, suggesting that other sites are responsible for the experimental
activity, most likely edges or defects on the basal plane.

<br>
Floquet engineering, the concept of tailoring a system by a periodic drive,
is increasingly exploited to design and manipulate topological phases of
matter. In this work, we study periodically driven higher-order topological
Dirac semimetals associated with a $k$-dependent quantized quadrupole moment by
applying circularly polarized light. The undriven Dirac semimetals feature
gapless higher-order hinge Fermi arc states which are the consequence of the
higher-order topology of the Dirac nodes. Floquet Weyl semimetal phases with
hybrid-order topology, characterized by both a $k$-dependent quantized
quadrupole moment and a $k$-dependent Chern number, emerge when illumining
circularly polarized light. Such Floquet Weyl semimetals support both hinge
Fermi arc states and topological surface Fermi arc states. In addition, Floquet
Weyl semimetals with tilted Weyl cones in higher-order topological Dirac
semimetals are also discussed. Considering numerous higher-order topological
Dirac semimetal materials were recently proposed, our findings can be testable
soon.

We report the discovery of CeLiBi$_2$, the first example of a material in the
tetragonal Ce$TX_2$ ($T$ = transition metal; $X$ = pnictogen) family wherein an
alkali cation replaces the typical transition metal. Magnetic susceptibility
and neutron powder diffraction measurements are consistent with a crystal-field
$\Gamma_6$ ground state Kramers doublet that orders antiferromagnetically below
$T_N = 3.4$ K with an incommensurate propagation wave vector ${\bf{k}} = (0,
0.0724(4), 0.5)$ that generates a nanometric modulation of the magnetic
structure. The best model of the ordered state is an elliptical cycloid with Ce
moments primarily residing in the $ab$ plane. This is highly unusual, as all
other $\Gamma_6$ Ce$TX_2$ members order ferromagnetically. Further, we observe
an atypical hard-axis metamagnetic transition at $2$ T in magnetostriction,
magnetization, and resistivity measurements. CeLiBi$_2$ is a rare example of a
highly conductive material with dominant skew scattering leading to a large
anomalous Hall effect. Quantum oscillations with four frequencies arise in
magnetostriction data to $T = 30$ K, which indicate small Fermi pockets of
light carriers with effective masses as low as 0.07$m_e$. Density functional
theory calculations indicate that square-net Dirac-like Bi$-p$ bands are
responsible for these ultralight carriers. Together, our results show that
CeLiBi$_2$ enables multiple atypical magnetic and electronic properties in a
single clean material.

In two-dimensional electron systems with broken inversion and time-reversal
symmetries, a Josephson junction reveals an anomalous response: the
supercurrent is nonzero even at zero phase difference between two
superconductors. We consider details of this peculiar phenomenon in the planar
double-barrier configurations of hybrid circuits, where the noncentrosymmetric
normal region is described in terms of the paradigmatic Rashba model of
spin-orbit coupling. We analyze this anomalous Josephson effect by means of
both the Ginzburg-Landau formalism and the microscopic Green's functions
approach in the clean limit. The magnitude of the critical current is
calculated for an arbitrary in-plane magnetic field orientations, and anomalous
phase shifts in the Josephson current-phase relation are determined in terms of
the parameters of the model in several limiting cases.

<h3>The effect of vanadium substitution on the structural and magnetic  properties of (Fe$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$)$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$</h3>

<br>
Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ displays a complex magnetic phase diagram that is sensitive
and tunable with both electronic and crystallographic structure changes. In
order to explore this tunability, vanadium-doped
(Fe$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$)$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ has been synthesized and characterized.
High-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement show that
samples up to 20\% V-doping remain isostructural to Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ and
display a linear increase in unit cell volume as doping is increased. Magnetic
measurements reveal a suppression of the antiferromagnetic helical spin-density
wave (SDW) with V-doping, revealed by changes in both the low-temperature
ferromagnetic-antiferromagentic (FM-AFM) transition (T$_{1}$) and
high-temperature AFM-FM transition (T$_{2}$). At 7.5\% V-doping, the
metamagnetic behavior of the helical AFM SDW phase is no longer observed. These
results offer an avenue to effective tuning of the magnetic order in
Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ for devices, as well as increased understanding of the
magnetism in this system.

Using micromagnetic simulations, we study the interplay between strongly
voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), $\Delta K = \pm$200 kJ/m$^3$,
and gate width, $w=$ 10--400 nm, in voltage-gated W/CoFeB/MgO based
nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators. The VCMA modifies the local
magnetic properties such that the magnetodynamics transitions between regimes
of \emph{i}) confinement, \emph{ii}) tuning, and \emph{iii}) separation, with
qualitatively different behavior. We find that the strongest tuning is achieved
for gate widths of the same size as the the constriction width, for which the
effective damping can be increased an order of magnitude compared to its
intrinsic value. As a consequence, voltage control remains efficient over a
very large frequency range, and subsequent manufacturing advances could allow
SHNOs to be easily integrated into next-generation electronics for further
fundamental studies and industrial applications.

<br>
Recent pioneering works have set the stage for exploring anyon braiding
statistics from negative current cross-correlations along two intersecting
quasiparticle beams. In such a dual-source - analyzer quantum point contact
setup, also referred to as 'collider', the anyon exchange phase of fractional
quantum Hall quasiparticles is predicted to be imprinted into the
cross-correlations characterized by an effective Fano-factor $P$. In the case
of symmetric incoming quasiparticle beams, conventional fermions result in a
vanishing $P$. In marked contrast, we observe signatures of anyon statistics in
the negative $P$ found both for the $e/3$ Laughlin quasiparticles at filling
factor $\nu=1/3$ ($P\approx-2$, corroborating previous findings), and for the
$e/5$ quasiparticles in the hierarchical state $\nu=2/5$ ($P\approx-1$).
Nevertheless, we argue that the quantitative connection between numerical value
of $P\neq0$ and specific fractional exchange phase is hampered by the influence
of the analyzer conductance dependence on the voltages used to generate the
quasiparticles. Finally, we address the important challenge how to distinguish
at $\nu=1/3$ between negative cross-correlations induced by a fractional braid
phase, and those resulting from a different Andreev-like mechanism. Although
with symmetric sources $P$ does not exhibit signatures of a crossover when the
analyzer is progressively detuned to favor Andreev processes, we demonstrate
that changing the balance between sources provides a mean to discriminate
between the two mechanisms.

<h3>Minimal entropy production in anisotropic temperature fields</h3>

Anisotropy of temperature fields, chemical potentials and ion concentration
gradients provide the fuel that feeds dynamical processes that sustain life.
Dynamical flows in respective environments incur losses manifested as entropy
production. In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped
stochastic thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and
analyze the problem to minimize entropy production while driving the system
between thermodynamic states in finite time. It is noted that entropy
production in a fully isotropic temperature field, can be expressed as the
Wasserstein-2 length of the path traversed by the thermodynamic state of the
system. In the presence of an anisotropic temperature field, the mechanism of
entropy production is substantially more complicated as, besides dissipation,
it entails seepage of energy between the ambient heat sources by way of the
system dynamics. We show that, in this case, the entropy production can be
expressed as the solution of a suitably constrained and generalized Optimal
Mass Transport (OMT) problem. In contrast to the situation in standard OMT,
entropy production may not be identically zero, even when the thermodynamic
state remains unchanged. Physically, this is due to the fact that maintaining a
Non-Equilibrium Steady State (NESS), incurs an intrinsic entropic cost. As
already noted, NESSs are the hallmark of life and living systems by necessity
operate away from equilibrium. Thus our problem of minimizing entropy
production appears of central importance in understanding biological processes,
such as molecular motors and motor proteins, and on how such processes may have
evolved to optimize for available usage of resources.

<h3>Comparing fractional quantum Hall Laughlin and Jain topological orders  with the anyon collider</h3>

Anyon collision experiments have recently demonstrated the ability to
discriminate between fermionic and anyonic statistics. However, only one type
of anyons associated with the simple Laughlin state at filling factor $\nu=1/3$
has been probed so far. It is now important to establish anyon collisions as
quantitative probes of fractional statistics for more complex topological
orders, with the ability to distinguish between different species of anyons
with different statistics. In this work, we use the anyon collider to compare
the Laughlin $\nu=1/3$ state, which is used as the reference state, with the
more complex Jain state at $\nu=2/5$, where low energy excitations are carried
by two co-propagating edge channels. We demonstrate that anyons generated on
the outer channel of the $\nu=2/5$ state (with a fractional charge $e^*=e/3$)
have a similar behavior compared to $\nu=1/3$, showing the robustness of anyon
collision signals for anyons of the same type. In contrast, anyons emitted on
the inner channel of $\nu=2/5$ (with a fractional charge $e^*=e/5$) exhibit a
reduced degree of bunching compared to the $\nu=1/3$ case, demonstrating the
ability of the anyon collider to discriminate not only between anyons and
fermions, but also between different species of anyons associated with
different topological orders of the bulk. Our experimental results for the
inner channel of $\nu=2/5$ also point towards an influence of interchannel
interactions in anyon collision experiments when several co-propagating edge
channels are present. A quantitative understanding of these effects will be
important for extensions of anyon collisions to non-abelian topological orders,
where several charged and neutral modes propagate at the edge.

<br>
For the distinction of the Andreev bound states and Majorana bound states, we
study the waiting time distributions (WTDs) for heterostructures, based on one
dimensional edge states of a two dimensional topological insulators (TI) in
combination with an proximitized s-wave superconductor (SC) and an applied
magnetic field. We show for the time reversal symmetric (TRS) situation of a
Josephson junction details of the WTD. This includes different transport
processes, different numbers of Andreev bound states and the phase difference
of the SC. We further consider a Zeeman field in the normal part of the
junctions revealing novel features in the WTD along the phase transition
between trivial bound states and Majorana bound states. We finally discuss
clear signatures to discriminate between them.

<h3>Slow semiclassical dynamics of a two-dimensional Hubbard model in  disorder-free potentials</h3>

<br>
The quench dynamics of the Hubbard model in tilted and harmonic potentials is
discussed within the semiclassical picture. Applying the fermionic truncated
Wigner approximation (fTWA), the dynamics of imbalances for charge and spin
degrees of freedom is analyzed and its time evolution is compared with the
exact simulations in one-dimensional lattice. Quench from charge or spin
density wave is considered. We show that introduction of harmonic and
spin-dependent linear potentials sufficiently validates fTWA for longer times.
Such an improvement of fTWA is also obtained for the higher order correlations
in terms of quantum Fisher information for charge and spin channels. This
allows us to discuss the dynamics of larger system sizes and connect our
discussion to the recently introduced Stark many-body localization. In
particular, we focus on a finite two-dimensional system and show that at
intermediate linear potential strength, the addition of a harmonic potential
and spin dependence of the tilt, results in subdiffusive dynamics, similar to
that of disordered systems. Moreover, for specific values of harmonic
potential, we observed phase separation of ergodic and non-ergodic regions in
real space. The latter fact is especially important for ultracold atom
experiments in which harmonic confinement can be easily imposed, causing a
significant change in relaxation times for different lattice locations.

Gases of doubly-dipolar particles, with both magnetic and electric dipole
moments, offer intriguing novel possibilities. We show that the interplay
between doubly-dipolar interactions, quantum stabilizat\ ion, and external
confinement results in a rich ground-state physics of supersolids and
incoherent droplet arrays in doubly-dipolar condensates. Our study reveals
novel possibilities for engineering quan\ tum droplets and droplet supersolids,
including supersolid-supersolid transitions and the realization of supersolid
arrays of pancake droplets.

<h3>Photoinduced Superconductivity Reconsidered: The Role of  Photoconductivity Profile Distortion</h3>

We discuss a systematic uncertainty in time-resolved optical conductivity
measurements that becomes important at high pump intensities. We show that
common optical nonlinearities can distort the photoconductivity depth profile,
and by extension distort the photoconductivity spectrum. We show evidence that
this distortion is present in existing measurements on K$_{3}$C$_{60}$, and
describe how it may create the appearance of photoinduced superconductivity
where none exists. Similar errors may emerge in other pump-probe spectroscopy
measurements, and we discuss how to correct for them.
