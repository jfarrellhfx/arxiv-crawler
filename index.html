<h3>Spectral narrowing of phonon signature in time-domain sum-frequency  spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04593" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04593</a>

Sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy provides a versatile method for
the investigation of non-centrosymmetric media and interfaces. Here, using
tunable picosecond infrared (IR) pulses from a free-electron laser, the
nonlinear optical response of 4H-SiC, a common polytype of silicon carbide, has
been probed in the frequency- and time-domain by vibrational SFG spectroscopy.
In the steady-state spectra, resonances originating from IR-active phonons of
the bulk crystal are present. Linear optical effects are shown to have a
significant contribution to the SFG spectrum. In the time domain, the
development of the SFG intensity is linked to the free-induction decay of the
induced coherent IR polarization. Close to a vibrational resonance, a slower
polarization dephasing is observed compared to off-resonant IR excitation.
Thus, temporal separation of IR and up-conversion pulse allows for an enhanced
spectral resolution of the phonon modes, as corroborated by model calculations.

<h3>Anomalous Quantum Hall Bilayer Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04613" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04613</a>

Quantum Hall bilayers (QHB) are two-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
systems that provide a unique platform to realize exotic Abelian/non-Abelian
FQH and excitonic condensate states, but in the presence of a high magnetic
field. Here, we show that these states can be realized in an analogue of
bilayer Kagome lattice with flat bands (FBs) in each layer, leading to
anomalous quantum Hall bilayer effect, without magnetic field. Using exact
diagonalization of finite size bilayer Kagome lattices we demonstrate the
stabilization of excitonic condensate Halperin's (1,1,1) and (3,3,3) state at
the total filling $v_T=1$ and $v_T=1/3$ of the two FBs, respectively. We
further show that by tuning the interlayer tunneling at $v_T=2/3$, one can
expect a phase transition from Halperin's (3,3,1) state to particle-hole
conjugate of Laughlin's 1/3 state, as previously observed in QHB systems. Our
work significantly enriches the field of FB physics by demonstrating bilayer FB
systems as an attractive avenue for realizing exotic QHB states, including
non-Abelian anyons, without magnetic field.

<h3>Physics-separating artificial neural networks for predicting initial  stages of Al sputtering and thin film deposition in Ar plasma discharges</h3>

Simulations of Al thin film sputter depositions rely on accurate plasma and
surface interaction models. Establishing the latter commonly requires a higher
level of abstraction and means to dismiss the fundamental atomic fidelity.
Previous works on sputtering processes addressed this issue by establishing
machine learning surrogate models, which include a basic surface state (i.e.,
stoichiometry) as static input. In this work, an evolving surface state and
defect structure are introduced to jointly describe sputtering and growth with
physics-separating artificial neural networks. The data describing the
plasma-surface interactions stem from hybrid reactive molecular
dynamics/time-stamped force bias Monte Carlo simulations of Al neutrals and
Ar$^+$ ions impinging onto Al(001) surfaces. It is demonstrated that the
fundamental processes are comprehensively described by taking the surface state
as well as defect structure into account. Hence, a machine learning
plasma-surface interaction surrogate model is established that resolves the
inherent kinetics with high physical fidelity. The resulting model is not
restricted to input from modeling and simulation, but may similarly be applied
to experimental input data.

<h3>Charge ordering as the driving mechanism for superconductivity in  rare-earth nickel oxides</h3>

Superconductivity is one of the most intriguing properties of matter
described by an attractive interaction that bounds electrons into Cooper pairs.
To date, the highest critical temperature at ambient conditions is achieved in
copper oxides. While layered nickel oxides were long proposed to be analogous
to cuprates, superconductivity was only demonstrated in 2019 albeit without
clarifying the pairing mechanism. Here we use Density Functional Theory (DFT)
to show that superconductivity in nickelates is driven by an electron-phonon
coupling originating from a charge ordering. Due to an intrinsic electronic
instability in half-doped compounds, Ni1.5+ cations dismutate into more stable
Ni+ and Ni2+ cations, which is accompanied by a bond disproportionation of NiO4
complexes producing an insulating charge ordered state. Once doping suppresses
the instability, the bond disproportionation vibration is sufficient to
reproduce the key characteristic of nickelates observed experimentally, notably
the dome of Tc as a function of doping content. These phenomena are identified
if relevant degrees of freedom as well as an exchange correlation functional
that sufficiently amends self-interaction errors are involved in the
simulations. Finally, despite the presence of correlation effects inherent to
3d elements, nickelates superconductors appear similar to non-magnetic bismuth
oxide superconductors.

Radio-frequency measurements could satisfy DiVincenzo's readout criterion in
future large-scale solid-state quantum processors, as they allow for high
bandwidths and frequency multiplexing. However, the scalability potential of
this readout technique can only be leveraged if quantum device tuning is
performed using exclusively radio-frequency measurements i.e. without resorting
to current measurements. We demonstrate an algorithm that automatically tunes
double quantum dots using only radio-frequency reflectometry. Exploiting the
high bandwidth of radio-frequency measurements, the tuning was completed within
a few minutes without prior knowledge about the device architecture. Our
results show that it is possible to eliminate the need for transport
measurements for quantum dot tuning, paving the way for more scalable device
architectures.

<h3>Exploring the phases of 3D artificial spin ice: From Coulomb phase to  magnetic monopole crystal</h3>

Artificial spin-ices consist of lithographic arrays of single-domain magnetic
nanowires organised into frustrated lattices. These geometries are usually
two-dimensional, allowing a direct exploration of physics associated with
frustration, topology and emergence. Recently, three-dimensional geometries
have been realised, in which transport of emergent monopoles can be directly
visualised upon the surface. Here we carry out an exploration of the
three-dimensional artificial spin-ice phase diagram, whereby dipoles are placed
within a diamond-bond lattice geometry. We find a rich phase diagram,
consisting of a double-charged monopole crystal, a single-charged monopole
crystal and conventional spin-ice with pinch points associated with a Coulomb
phase. In our experimental demagnetised systems, broken symmetry forces
formation of ferromagnetic stripes upon the surface, a configuration that
forbids the formation of the lower energy double-charged monopole crystal.
Instead, we observe crystallites of single magnetic charge, superimposed upon
an ice background. The crystallites are found to form due to the intricate
distribution of magnetic charge around a three-dimensional nanostructured
vertex, which locally favours monopole formation. Our work suggests that
engineered surface energetics can be used to tune the ground state of
experimental three-dimensional ASI systems.

<h3>A physics-aware deep learning model for energy localization in  multiscale shock-to-detonation simulations of heterogeneous energetic  materials</h3>

Predictive simulations of the shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) in
heterogeneous energetic materials (EM) are vital to the design and control of
their energy release and sensitivity. Due to the complexity of the
thermo-mechanics of EM during the SDT, both macro-scale response and sub-grid
mesoscale energy localization must be captured accurately. This work proposes
an efficient and accurate multiscale framework for SDT simulations of EM. We
employ deep learning to model the mesoscale energy localization of
shock-initiated EM microstructures upon which prediction results are used to
supply reaction progress rate information to the macroscale SDT simulation. The
proposed multiscale modeling framework is divided into two stages. First, a
physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) is used to model
the mesoscale energy localization of shock-initiated heterogeneous EM
microstructures. PARC is trained using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of
hotspot ignition and growth within microstructures of pressed HMX material
subjected to different input shock strengths. After training, PARC is employed
to supply hotspot ignition and growth rates for macroscale SDT simulations. We
show that PARC can play the role of a surrogate model in a multiscale
simulation framework, while drastically reducing the computation cost and
providing improved representations of the sub-grid physics. The proposed
multiscale modeling approach will provide a new tool for material scientists in
designing high-performance and safer energetic materials.

<h3>Miscibility amongst AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome superconductors: design of mixed  A-site AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A: K, Rb, Cs) alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work we explore the chemical-property phase diagram of the
AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family through A-site alloying. We demonstrate full miscibility of
the alkali-site, highlighting that the three parent compounds are the terminal
ends of a single solid-solution. Using both polycrystalline and single crystal
methods, we map the dependence of the two primary electronic instabilities: (1)
the onset of charge density wave (CDW) order ($T_\text{CDW}$) and (2) the onset
of superconductivity ($T_\text{c}$) with alkali-site composition. We show
continuous trends in both $T_\text{CDW}$ and $T_\text{c}$, including a region
of enhanced CDW stability in K$_{1-x}$Cs$_{x}$V$_3$Sb$_5$ alloys. Together, our
results open new routes for chemical perturbation and exploration of the
chemical-property relationships in the class of AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome
superconductors.

The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the fullerene C$_{60}$ in a
magnetic field has $4s$ ground-state magnetization discontinuities as a
function of the spin quantum number $s$ that disappear at the classical limit.
The molecule can be seen as the fullerene C$_{20}$ with interpentagonal
interactions that can be tuned to generate the discontinuities. The results
show how spatial symmetry dictates the magnetic response of the $I_h$ fullerene
molecules.

<h3>Insights into the Limitations of Parameter Transferability in  Heteronuclear SAFT-type Equations of State</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04606" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04606</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The use of heteronuclear models are often viewed as ways to improve the
predictive ability and parameter transferability of advanced association
models, such as those derived from the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory
(SAFT). Indeed, several results in the literature have suggested that this
approach can be useful to accurately describe a given family/series of
homologous compounds and their mixtures, with accuracies competitive (and in
some cases better) than those obtained using the more traditional SAFT
variants. However, the parameter transferability of the different groups, i.e.
between different families of compounds, without the introduction of new groups
or refitting existing ones, is seldom reported, and often overlooked, making an
accurate evaluation of the heteronuclear models difficult. This work analyzes
whether the increased complexity of a heteronuclear treatment of a SAFT-type
EoS, namely the SAFT-{\gamma}-Mie EoS, results in a significant increase on
both the predictive ability and parameter transferability of the model, across
different families of compounds. This is done by using a case study involving
some different (yet related) families of compounds, containing a small number
of common functional groups. The results obtained show that the transferability
of group parameters, across different families of compounds, in a heteronuclear
SAFT-type EoS does not allow an adequate description of the phase equilibria of
these systems. Therefore, to achieve a reasonable accuracy in the description
of these systems, a specific refitting of group parameters is required for a
given family, or even for a particular system, destroying the predictive
capability of these models. Moreover, this increases the number of adjustable
parameters to numbers similar to those used in homonuclear approaches, further
reducing the advantages of using heteronuclear models.

<h3>Observation of multi-directional energy transfer in a hybrid  plasmonic-excitonic nanostructure</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized
surface plasmons to amplify light-matter interaction, and a non-plasmonic
material to functionalize charge excitations. Application-relevant epitaxial
heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that
challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional
nanometal-to-substrate energy transfer. We study epitaxial Au nanoislands on
WSe$_2$ with time-, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond
electron diffraction: this combination resolves material, energy and momentum
of charge-carriers and phonons. We observe a strong non-linear plasmon-exciton
interaction that transfers the energy of sub-bandgap photons very efficiently
to the semiconductor, leaving the metal cold until non-radiative exciton
recombination heats the nanoparticles after 200 fs. Our results resolve a
multi-directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic
thermalization of the nanometal. Electron-phonon coupling and diffusive
charge-transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics
opens perspectives for optoelectronic and phtocatalitic applications, while
providing a constraining experimental testbed for state-of-the-art modelling.

<h3>Linear complexions directly modify dislocation motion in face-centered  cubic alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04616" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04616</a>
<br>
<i>Divya Singh, Vladyslav Turlo, Daniel S. Gianola, Timothy J. Rupert</i>
<br>
<br>
Linear complexions are defect phases that form in the presence of
dislocations and thus are promising for the direct control of plasticity. In
this study, atomistic simulations are used to model the effect of linear
complexions on dislocation-based mechanisms for plasticity, demonstrating
unique behaviors that differ from classical dislocation glide mechanisms.
Linear complexions impart higher resistance to the initiation and continuation
of dislocation motion when compared to solid solution strengthening in all of
the face-centered cubic alloys investigated here, with the exact strengthening
level determined by the linear complexion type. Stacking fault linear
complexions impart the most pronounced strengthening effect, as the dislocation
core is delocalized, and initiation of plastic flow requires a dislocation
nucleation event. The nanoparticle and platelet array linear complexions impart
strengthening by acting as pinning sites for the dislocations, where the
dislocations unpin one at a time through bowing mechanisms. For the
nanoparticle arrays, this event occurs even though the obstacles do not cross
the slip plane and instead only interact through modification of the
dislocation's stress field. The bowing modes observed in the current work
appear similar to traditional Orowan bowing around classical precipitates but
differ in a number of important ways depending on the complexion type. As a
whole, this study demonstrates that linear complexions are a unique tool for
microstructure engineering that can allow for the creation of alloys with new
plastic deformation mechanisms and extreme strength.

<h3>Percolation in two-species antagonistic random sequential adsorption in  two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04622</a>
<br>
<i>Paulo H. L. Martins, Ronald Dickman, Robert M. Ziff</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider two-species random sequential adsorption (RSA) in which species A
and B adsorb randomly on a lattice with the restriction that opposite species
cannot occupy nearest-neighbor sites. When the probability $x_A$ of choosing an
A particle for an adsorption trial reaches a critical value $0.626441(1)$, the
A species percolates and/or the blocked sites X (those with at least one A and
one B nearest neighbor) percolate. Analysis of the size-distribution exponent
$\tau$, the wrapping probabilities, and the excess cluster number shows that
the percolation transition is consistent with that of ordinary percolation. We
obtain an exact result for the low $x_B = 1 - x_A$ jamming behavior: $\theta_A
= 1 - x_B +b_2 x_B^2+\mathcal{O}(x_B^3)$, $\theta_B =
x_B/(z+1)+\mathcal{O}(x_B^2)$ for a $z$-coordinated lattice, where $\theta_A$
and $\theta_B$ are respectively the saturation coverages of species A and B. We
also show how differences between wrapping probabilities of A and X clusters,
as well as differences in the number of A and X clusters, can be used to find
the transition point accurately. For the one-dimensional case a three-site
approximation appears to provide exact results for the coverages.

<h3>Quantum-critical scaling at the Bose-glass transition of the 3d diluted  Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04645" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04645</a>
<br>
<i>Yuchen Fan, Rong Yu, Tommaso Roscilde</i>
<br>
<br>
The nature of the superfluid-to-Bose-glass (SF-BG) quantum phase transition,
occurring in systems of interacting bosons immersed in a disordered
environment, remains elusive. One fundamental open question is whether or not
the transition obeys conventional scaling at quantum critical points (QCPs):
this scaling would lock the value of the crossover exponent $\phi$ -- dictating
the vanishing of the superfluid critical temperature upon approaching the QCP
-- to the value of quantum critical exponents for the ground-state transition.
Yet such a relation between exponents has been called into question by several
numerical as well as experimental results on the SF-BG transition. Here we
revisit this issue in the case of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a
site-diluted cubic lattice, which lends itself to efficient quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. Our results show that the model exhibits a percolation transition
in zero applied field, with the correlation length exponent $\nu = 0.87(8)$ and
$\phi = 1.1(1)$ consistent with 3d percolation. When applying a sufficiently
strong magnetic field, the dilution-induced transition decouples from geometric
percolation, and it becomes a SF-BG transition; nonetheless, the $\nu$ and
$\phi$ exponents maintain values consistent with those of the percolation
transition. These results contradict the conventional scaling, which predicts
$\phi\geqslant 2$; and they suggest a close connection between the SF-BG
transition and percolation.

<h3>CrRhAs: a member of a large family of metallic kagome antiferromagnets</h3>

Kagome lattice materials are an important platform for highly frustrated
magnetism as well as for a plethora of phenomena resulting from flat bands,
Dirac cones and van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. We study
the little known metallic magnet CrRhAs, which belongs to a vast family of
materials that include $3d$, $4f$ and $5f$ magnetic elements, as well as
numerous nonmagnetic metals and insulators. Using noncollinear spin density
functional calculations (mostly spin spirals), we extract a model magnetic
Hamiltonian for CrRhAs. While it is dominated by an antiferromagnetic second
nearest neighbor coupling in the kagome plane, the metallic nature of the
compound leads to numerous nonzero longer range couplings and to important ring
exchange terms. We analyze this Hamiltonian and find unusual ground states
which are dominated by nearly isolated antiferromagnetic triangles that adopt
120$^\circ$ order either with positive or with negative vector chirality. We
discuss the connection to the few known experimental facts about CrRhAs.
Finally, we give a brief survey of other interesting magnetic members of this
family of kagome compounds.

<h3>A new look at the temperature-dependent properties of the  antiferroelectric model PbZrO3: an effective Hamiltonian study</h3>

<br>
<br>
A novel atomistic effective Hamiltonian scheme, incorporating an original and
simple bilinear energetic coupling, is developed and used to investigate the
temperature dependent physical properties of the prototype antiferroelectric
PbZrO3 (PZO) system. This scheme reproduces very well the known experimental
hallmarks of the complex Pbam orthorhombic phase at low temperatures and the
cubic paraelectric state of Pm 3m symmetry at high temperatures. Unexpectedly,
it further predicts a novel intermediate state also of Pbam symmetry, but in
which anti-phase oxygen octahedral tiltings have vanished with respect to the
Pbam ground state. Interestingly, such new state exhibits a large dielectric
response and thermal expansion that remarkably agree with previous experimental
observations and the x-ray experiments we performed. We also conducted direct
first-principles calculations at 0K which further support such low energy
phase. Within this fresh framework, a re-examination of the properties of PZO
is thus called for.

<h3>Spontaneous electric-polarization topology in confined ferroelectric  nematics</h3>

Topological spin and polar textures have fascinated people in different areas
of physics and technologies. However, the observations are limited in magnetic
and solid-state ferroelectric systems. Ferroelectric nematic is the first
liquid-state ferroelectric that would carry many possibilities of spatially
distributed polarization fields. Contrary to traditional magnetic or
crystalline systems, anisotropic liquid crystal interactions can compete with
the polarization counterparts, thereby setting a challenge in understating
their interplays and the resultant topologies. Here, we discover chiral
polarization meron-like structures during the emergence and growth of quasi-2D
ferroelectric nematic domains, which are visualized by fluorescence confocal
polarizing microscopy and second harmonic generation microscopies. Such
micrometre-scale polarization textures are the modified electric variants of
the magnetic merons. Unlike the conventional liquid crystal textures driven
solely by the elasticity, the polarization field puts additional topological
constraints, e.g., head-to-tail asymmetry, to the systems and results in a
variety of previously unidentified polar topological patterns. The chirality
can emerge spontaneously in polar textures and can be additionally biased by
introducing chiral dopants. An extended mean-field modelling for the
ferroelectric nematics reveals that the polarization strength of systems plays
a dedicated role in determining polarization topology, providing a guide for
exploring diverse polar textures in strongly-polarized liquid crystals.

This work obtains the efficiency at maximum power for a stochastic heat
engine performing Carnot-like, Stirling-like and Ericsson-like cycles. For the
mesoscopic engine a Brownian particle trapped by an optical tweezers is
considered. The dynamics of this stochastic engine is described as an
overdamped Langevin equation with a harmonic potential, whereas is in contact
with two thermal baths at different temperatures, namely, hot ($T_h$) and cold
($T_c$). The harmonic oscillator Langevin equation is transformed into a
macroscopic equation associated with the mean value $\langle x^2(t)\rangle$
using the original Langevin approach. At equilibrium stationary state this
quantity satisfies a state-like equation from which the thermodynamic
properties are calculated. To obtained the efficiency at maximum power it is
considered the finite-time cycle processes under the framework of low
dissipation approach.

<h3>The Chain Flexibility Effects on the Self-assembly of Diblock Copolymer  in Thin Film</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04714</a>

<i>Mingyang Chen, Yuguo Chen, Yanyan Zhu, Ying Jiang, David Andelman, Xingkun Man</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effects of chain flexibility on the self-assembly behavior
of symmetric diblock copolymers (BCPs) when they are confined as a thin film
between two surfaces. Employing worm-like chain (WLC) self-consistent field
theory, we study the relative stability of parallel (L$_{\parallel}$) and
perpendicular (L$_{\perp}$) orientations of BCP lamellar phases, ranging in
chain flexibility from flexible Gaussian chains to semi-flexible and rigid
chains. For flat and neutral bounding surfaces (no surface preference for one
of the two BCP components), the stability of the L$_{\perp}$ lamellae increases
with chain rigidity. When the top surface is flat and the bottom substrate is
corrugated, increasing the surface roughness enhances the stability of the
L$_{\perp}$ lamellae for flexible Gaussian chains. However, an opposite
behavior is observed for rigid chains, where the L$_{\perp}$ stability
decreases as the substrate roughness increases. We further show that as the
substrate roughness increases, the critical value of the substrate preference,
$u^{*}$, corresponding to an L$_{\perp}$-to-L$_{\parallel}$ transition,
decreases for rigid chains, while it increases for flexible Gaussian chains.
Our results highlight the physical mechanism of tailoring the orientation of
lamellar phases in thin-film setups. This is of importance, in particular, for
short (semi-flexible or rigid) chains that are in high demand in emerging
nanolithography and other industrial applications.

An important challenge in exploring the dynamics of a mobile impurity
immersed in the field excitations comes from the necessity to include the
entanglement between the impurity and the surrounding excitations. To address
this challenge, the impurity's effective mass has to be assumed as finite,
rather than infinite. Here we theoretically investigate how a finite-mass
impurity interacts with a nonlinear excitation (i.e., soliton) in the polariton
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), which is intrinsically non-equilibrium. Using
the Lagrange variational method and the open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, we analytically derive the interaction phase diagram between a bright
soliton and an impurity in a polariton BEC. We show that when the soliton
collide with the impurity, it can transmit through, be trapped, or reflected.
Our work goes beyond prior researches in the context of equilibrium systems,
and opens a new perspective toward understanding the nonequilibrium dynamics of
a mobile impurity immersed in the nonliear field excitations.

<h3>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of trion-polaritons and  exciton-polaritons in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04726</a>

We present a microscopic many-body calculation of the nonlinear
two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) of trion-polaritons and
exciton-polaritons in charge-tunable transition-metal-dichalcogenides
monolayers placed in an optical microcavity. The charge tunability leads to an
electron gas with nonzero density that brings brightness to the trion - a
polaron quasiparticle formed by an exciton with a nonzero residue bounded to
the electron gas. As a result, a trion-polariton is created under strong
light-matter coupling, as observed in the recent experiment by Sidler
\textit{et al.} {[}Nat. Phys. \textbf{13}, 255 (2017){]}. We analyze in detail
the structure of trion-polaritons, by solving an extended Chevy ansatz for the
trion quasiparticle wave-function. We confirm that the effective light-matter
coupling for trion-polaritons is determined by the residue of the trion
quasiparticle. The solution of the full many-body polaron states within Chevy
ansatz enables us to microscopically calculate the nonlinear 2DCS spectrum of
both trion-polaritons and exciton-polaritons. We predict the existence of three
kinds of off-diagonal cross-peaks in the 2DCS spectrum, as an indication of the
coherence among the different branches of trion-polaritons and
exciton-polaritons. Due to the sensitivity of 2DCS spectrum to quasiparticle
interactions, our work provides a good starting point to explore the strong
nonlinearity exhibited by trion-polaritons in some recent exciton-polariton
experiments.

Systems supporting exciton-polaritons represent solid-state optical platforms
with a strong built-in optical nonlinearity provided by exciton-exciton
interactions. In conventional semiconductors with hydrogen-like excitons the
nonlinearity rate demonstrates the inverse scaling with the binding energy.
This makes excitons stable at room temperatures weakly interacting, which
obviously limits the possibilities of practical applications of the
corresponding materials for nonlinear photonics. We demonstrate experimentally
and theoretically, that these limitations can be substantially softened in
hybrid perovskites, such as MAPbBr3 due to the crucial role of the polaron
effects mediating the inter-particle interactions. The resulting
exciton-polaron-polaritons remain both stable and strongly interacting at room
temperature, which is confirmed by large nonlinear blueshifts of lower
polariton branch energy under resonant femtosecond laser pulse excitation. Our
findings open novel perspectives for the management of the exciton-polariton
nonlinearities in ambient conditions.

<br>
<br>
The properties of the ground state of the simplest frustrated system, the
dilute Ising chain in a magnetic field, are rigorously investigated over the
entire range of concentrations of charged non-magnetic impurities. Analytical
methods are proposed for calculating the residual entropy of frustrated states,
including states at phase boundaries, which are based on the Markov property of
the system and involve solving a linear optimization problem for energy and a
nonlinear optimization problem for entropy. These methods allow obvious
generalizations for one-dimensional pseudospin models with anisotropic
interactions. We calculate the composition, entropy and magnetization for the
ground state phases. We prove the absence of pseudo-transitions in the dilute
Ising chain, since the residual entropy of states at phase boundaries is always
higher than the entropy of adjacent phases. The concentration dependencies of
magnetization at the phase boundaries are obtained, and unlike linear
dependencies for adjacent phases, they have nonlinear behavior. Field-induced
transitions between ground states and entropy jumps associated with them are
also considered, and in particular, it is shown that the field-induced
transition from an antiferromagnetic state to a frustrated one is accompanied
by charge ordering.

<br>
The Floquet engineering opens the way to create new topological states
without counterparts in static systems. Here, we report the experimental
realization and characterization of new anomalous topological states with
high-precision Floquet engineering for ultracold atoms trapped in a shaking
optical Raman lattice. The Floquet band topology is manipulated by tuning the
driving-induced band crossings referred to as band inversion surfaces (BISs),
whose configurations fully characterize the topology of the underlying states.
We uncover various exotic anomalous topological states by measuring the
configurations of BISs which correspond to the bulk Floquet topology. In
particular, we identify an unprecedented anomalous Floquet valley-Hall state
that possesses anomalous helicallike edge modes protected by valleys and a
chiral state with high Chern number.

<h3>Drastic suppression of CDW (charge density wave) by Pd addition in TiSe2</h3>

<br>
<br>
TiSe2 is a known Topological semimetal (TSM) having both the semi-metallic
and topological characters simultaneously and the Charge density wave (CDW) at
below 200K. In the current short article, we study the impact of Pd addition on
the CDW character of TiSe2 and the possible induction of superconductivity at
low temperatures. Bulk samples of TiSe2 and Pd0.1TiSe2 are synthesized by
solid-state reaction route, which is further characterized by powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),
respectively, for their structural and micro-structural details. The
vibrational modes of both samples are being analyzed by Raman spectroscopy,
showing the occurrence of both A1g and Eg modes. CDW of pure TiSe2 seen at
around 200K in electrical transport measurements, in terms of sharp
semi-metallic to metallic transition peak with hysteresis in cooling/warming
cycles is not seen in Pd0.1TiSe2, and rather a near metallic transport is seen
down to 2K. Although superconductivity is not seen down to 2K, the CDW
transition is seemingly completely suppressed in Pd0.1TiSe2. Pd addition in
TiSe2 suppresses CDW drastically. Trials are underway to induce
superconductivity in Pd-added TiSe2. Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations show primary evidence of suppression of CDW by adding Pd in TiSe2
due to an increase in the density of states.

Amorphous red phosphorus (a-P) is one of the remaining puzzling cases in the
structural chemistry of the elements. Here, we elucidate the structure,
stability, and chemical bond-ing in a-P from first principles, combining
machine-learning and density-functional theo-ry (DFT) methods. We show that a-P
structures exist with a range of energies slightly higher than those of
phosphorus nanorods, to which they are closely related, and that the stability
of a-P is linked to the degree of structural relaxation and medium-range order.
We thus complete the stability range of phosphorus allotropes [Angew. Chem.
Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 11629] by now including the previously poorly understood
amorphous phase, and we quantify the covalent and van der Waals interactions in
all main phases of phos-phorus. We also study the electronic densities of
states, including those of hydrogenated a-P. Beyond the present study, our
structural models are expected to enable wider-ranging first-principles
investigations - for example, of a-P-based battery materials.

Modern single-particle-tracking techniques produce extensive time-series of
diffusive motion in a wide variety of systems, from single-molecule motion in
living-cells to movement ecology. The quest is to decipher the physical
mechanisms encoded in the data and thus to better understand the probed
systems. We here augment recently proposed machine-learning techniques for
decoding anomalous-diffusion data to include an uncertainty estimate in
addition to the predicted output. To avoid the Black-Box-Problem a
Bayesian-Deep-Learning technique named Stochastic-Weight-Averaging-Gaussian is
used to train models for both the classification of the diffusion model and the
regression of the anomalous diffusion exponent of single-particle-trajectories.
Evaluating their performance, we find that these models can achieve a
well-calibrated error estimate while maintaining high prediction accuracies. In
the analysis of the output uncertainty predictions we relate these to
properties of the underlying diffusion models, thus providing insights into the
learning process of the machine and the relevance of the output.

<h3>Wood compression in four-dimensional in situ tomography</h3>

Wood deformation, in particular when subject to compression, exhibits
scale-free avalanche-like behavior as well as structure-dependent localization
of deformation. We have taken three-dimensional (3D) x-ray tomographs during
compression with constant stress rate loading. Using digital volume
correlation, we obtain the local total strain during the experiment and compare
it to the global strain and acoustic emission. The wood cells collapse layer by
layer throughout the sample starting from the softest parts, i.e., the spring
wood. As the damage progresses, more and more of the softwood layers throughout
the sample collapse, which indicates damage spreading instead of localization.
In 3D, one can see a fat-tailed local strain rate distribution, indicating that
inside the softwood layers, the damage occurs in localized spots. The observed
log-normal strain distribution is in agreement with this view of the
development of independent local collapses or irreversible deformation events.
A key feature in the mechanical behavior of wood is then in the complex
interaction of localized deformation between or among the annual rings.

<h3>Towards a robust criterion of anomalous diffusion</h3>

<br>
<br>
Anomalous-diffusion, the departure of the spreading dynamics of diffusing
particles from the traditional law of Brownian-motion, is a signature feature
of a large number of complex soft-matter and biological systems.
Anomalous-diffusion emerges due to a variety of physical mechanisms, e.g.,
trapping interactions or the viscoelasticity of the environment. However,
sometimes systems dynamics are erroneously claimed to be anomalous, despite the
fact that the true motion is Brownian -- or vice versa. This ambiguity in
establishing whether the dynamics as normal or anomalous can have far-reaching
consequences, e.g., in predictions for reaction- or relaxation-laws.
Demonstrating that a system exhibits normal- or anomalous-diffusion is highly
desirable for a vast host of applications. Here, we present a criterion for
anomalous-diffusion based on the method of power-spectral analysis of single
trajectories. The robustness of this criterion is studied for trajectories of
fractional-Brownian-motion, a ubiquitous stochastic process for the description
of anomalous-diffusion, in the presence of two types of measurement errors. In
particular, we find that our criterion is very robust for subdiffusion. Various
tests on surrogate data in absence or presence of additional positional noise
demonstrate the efficacy of this method in practical contexts. Finally, we
provide a proof-of-concept based on diverse experiments exhibiting both normal
and anomalous-diffusion.

<br>
<br>
There are a multitude of applications in which structural materials would be
desired to be nondestructively evaluated, while in a component, for plasticity
and failure characteristics. In this way, safety and resilience features can be
significantly improved. Nevertheless, while failure can be visible through
cracks, plasticity is commonly invisible and highly microstructure-dependent.
Here, we show that an equation-free method based on principal component
analysis is capable of detecting yielding and tertiary creep onset, directly
from strain fields that are obtained by digital image correlation, applicable
on components, continuously and nondestructively. We demonstrate the
applicability of the method to yielding of Ni-based Haynes 230 metal alloy
polycrystalline samples, which are also characterized through electron
microscopy and benchmarked using continuum polycrystalline plasticity modeling.
Also, we successfully apply this method to yielding during uniaxial tension of
Hastelloy X polycrystalline samples, and also to the onset of tertiary creep in
quasibrittle fiber composites under uniaxial tension. We conclude that there
are key features in the spatiotemporal fluctuations of local strain fields that
can be used to infer mechanical properties.

<h3>Penetrating a granular medium by successive impacts</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider the penetration dynamics of a vertical cylinder into a dry
granular medium subjected to successive impacts. The depth of the impactor
below the free surface $z_N$ first evolves linearly with the impact number $N$
and then follows a power-law evolution $z_N \propto N^{1/3}$. The depth reached
by the cylinder after a given number of impacts is observed to increase with
the impact energy but to decrease with its diameter and the density of the
granular medium. We develop a model that accounts for the quasi-static and
inertial granular forces applying on the cylinder to rationalize our
observations. This approach reveals the existence of two intrusion regimes for
large and small impact numbers, allowing all data to be rescaled on a master
curve. Then, we extend the study to the effect of sidewalls on the dynamics of
the impactor. We show that lateral confinement changes the dependence of the
impactor depth on the impact number $z_N (N)$. This effect is accounted for by
considering the increase of the granular drag with the lateral confinement.

<br>
<br>
The elasticity of disordered and polydisperse polymer networks is a
fundamental problem of soft matter physics that is still open. Here, we report
a simulation study of a model for such systems, prepared with either trivalent
or tetravalent crosslinks. The networks are self-assembled via equilibrium
simulations that result in an exponential strand length distribution, similar
to that of experimental randomly crosslinked systems. We find that the fractal
structure of the network depends on the initial density $\rho_\text{init}$, but
that systems with the same mean valence and same $\rho_\text{init}$ have the
same structural properties. Moreover, we compute the long-time limit of the
mean-squared displacement, also known as the (squared) localization length, of
the crosslinks and of the middle monomers of the strands, showing that the
dynamics of long strands is well described by the tube model. Finally, we find
a relation connecting these two localization lengths at high density, and
connect the crosslink localization length to the shear modulus of the system.

We study many-body localization in isotropic Heisenberg spin chains with the
local exchange parameters being subject to quenched disorder. The Hamiltonian
is invariant under global SU(2)- rotations and incorporates therefore a
nonabelian symmetry. Systems of common spin length 1/2 and 1 are studied
numerically using random matrix techniques. In both cases we find a transition
from an ergodic phase at small disorder strength to an incompletely localized
phase at stronger disorder. The transition is signaled by a maximum of the
sample-to-sample variance of the averaged consecutive-gap ratio. The
incompletely localized phase found here is distinguished from a fully localized
system by the scaling behavior of the sample-to-sample variance

The extended Bose-Hubbard model with correlated tunneling exhibits staggered
superfluid and supersolid quantum phases. We study finite-temperature phase
transitions of quantum phases of dipolar bosons in a two-dimensional optical
lattice using mean-field Gutzwiller and quantum Monte Carlo approaches. When
nearest-neighbor repulsion is comparable to the on-site interaction, we find
that the two topologically distinct superfluids are separated by a normal fluid
phase, while at stronger off-site interactions, density-modulated insulating
quantum phases appear. We estimate the critical temperature of the staggered
superfluid to normal fluid transition and show that this transition is of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Finally, we elucidate the coexistence of staggered
quantum phases in the presence of an external trapping potential. Our study
paves a way to observe novel staggered quantum phases in recent dipolar optical
lattice experiments.

We use a network of chiral junctions to construct a family of topological
chiral spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. The chiral spin liquid phase
harbors SU(2)$_k$ anyons, which stem from the underlying SU(2)$_k$ WZW models
that describe the constituent spin chains of the network. The network exhibits
quantized spin and thermal Hall conductances. We illustrate our construction by
inspecting the topological properties of the SU(2)$_2$ model. We find that this
model has emergent Ising anyons, with spinons acting as vortex excitations that
bind Majorana zero modes. We also show that the ground state of this network is
threefold degenerate on the torus, asserting its non-Abelian character. Our
results shed new light on the stability of non-Abelian topological phases in
artificial quantum materials.

<h3>A group-theoretic approach to the origin of chirality-induced spin  selectivity in non-magnetic molecular junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a range of spin-charge interconversion
phenomena in non-magnetic systems where spatial symmetries are reduced or
absent. Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), a term that generically
refers to a spin-dependent electron transfer in non-magnetic chiral systems, is
one such case, appearing in a variety of seemingly unrelated situations ranging
from inorganic materials to molecular devices. In particular, the origin of
CISS in molecular junctions is a matter of an intense current debate. Here we
contend that the necessary conditions for the CISS effect to appear can be
generally and fully understood on the basis of a complete symmetry analysis of
the molecular junction, and not only of the molecule. Our approach, which draws
on the use of point-group symmetries within the scattering formalism for
transport, shows that electrode symmetries are as important as those of the
molecule when it comes to the emergence of a spin-polarization and, therefore,
a possible appearance of CISS. It turns out that standalone metallic
nanocontacts can exhibit spin-polarization when relative rotations are
introduced which reduce the symmetry. As a corollary, molecular junctions with
$\textbf{achiral}$ molecules can also exhibit spin polarization along the
direction of transport, provided that the whole junction is chiral. This
formalism also allows to predict the qualitative changes on the
spin-polarization upon substitution of a chiral molecule in the junction with
its enantiomeric partner. Quantum transport calculations based on density
functional theory corroborate all of our predictions and provide further
quantitative insight.

The linear-in-temperature resistivity is one of the important mysteries in
the strange metal state of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. To uncover
this anomalous property, the energy-momentum-dependent imaginary part of the
self-energy Im ${\rm \Sigma}(k, \omega)$ holds the key information. Here we
perform systematic doping, momentum, and temperature-dependent angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurements of electron-doped cuprate ${\rm
La}_{2-x}{\rm Ce}_x{\rm CuO}_4$ and extract the evolution of the strange metal
scattering in momentum space. At low doping levels and low temperatures, Im
${\rm\Sigma} \propto \omega$ dependence dominates the whole momentum space. For
high doping levels and high temperatures, Im ${\rm\Sigma} \propto \omega^2$
shows up, starting from the antinodal region. By comparing with the hole-doped
cuprates ${\rm La}_{2-x}{\rm Sr}_x{\rm CuO}_4$ and ${\rm Bi}_2{\rm Sr}_2{\rm
CaCu}_2{\rm O}_8$, we find a dichotomy of the scattering rate exists along the
nodal and antinodal direction, which is ubiquitous in the cuprate family. Our
work provides new insight into the strange metal state in cuprates.

Increasing attention is currently given to carbyne, the sp1 hybridized
one-dimensional carbon allotrope, because of its predicted outstanding
mechanical, optical, and electrical properties. Although recently substantial
progress has been reported on confined carbyne synthesized inside double-walled
carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), its formation mechanism and precursors for growth
remain elusive. Here, we show a rational design of isotope engineered
ultra-clean DWCNTs as tailored hosts to trace the growth of carbyne, which
allows to identify the precursor and unravel the formation mechanism of carbyne
during high-vacuum annealing at high-temperatures. Using this approach,
ultra-clean DWCNTs with 80.4% 13C-enriched inner walls and outer tubes of
naturally abundant served to unambiguously prove that only the carbonaceous
materials inside the DWCNTs can act as precursors. The exchange of C atoms
between inner and outer tubes happens without any growth of carbyne. After
applying a secondary oxidation step, it is possible to produce the carbonaceous
precursors from the partially oxidized DWCNTs. In this manner, not only carbyne
with a record of ~28.8% 13C enrichment is grown, but concomitant healing,
reorganization and regrowth of the DWCNTs occurs. This work enables to identify
the precursor and trace the growth mechanism of confined carbyne with
engineered properties. This is a crucial step, towards accessing the full
application potential of confined carbyne hybrids by tailoring not only the
isotopic fillers, but also the inner and outer tubes of the DWCNT hosts.

surface. The build-up of polymer material was measured as a function of time
and temperature for both as-deposited films, as well as films that have been
rejuvenated to become normal glasses cooled from the equilibrium liquid. The
temporal evolution of the surface profile is well described by the
characteristic power law of capillary-driven surface flows. In all cases, the
surface evolution of the as-deposited films and the rejuvenated films are
enhanced compared to bulk and are not easily distinguishable from each other.
The temperature dependence of the measured relaxation times determined from the
surface evolution is found to be quantitatively comparable to similar studies
for high molecular weight spincast polystyrene. Comparisons to numerical
solutions of the glassy thin film equation provide quantitative estimates of
the surface mobility. For temperatures sufficiently close to the
glass-transition temperature, particle embedding is also measured and used as a
probe of bulk dynamics, and in particular bulk viscosity.

The spin degree of freedom is crucial for the understanding of any condensed
matter system. Knowledge of spin-mixing mechanisms is not only essential for
successful control and manipulation of spin-qubits, but also uncovers
fundamental properties of investigated devices and material. For
electrostatically-defined bilayer graphene quantum dots, in which recent
studies report spin-relaxation times T1 up to 50ms with strong magnetic field
dependence, we study spin-blockade phenomena at charge configuration
$(1,2)\leftrightarrow(0,3)$. We examine the dependence of the spin-blockade
leakage current on interdot tunnel coupling and on the magnitude and
orientation of externally applied magnetic field. In out-of-plane magnetic
field, the observed zero-field current peak could arise from finite-temperature
co-tunneling with the leads; though involvement of additional spin- and
valley-mixing mechanisms are necessary for explaining the persistent sharp side
peaks observed. In in-plane magnetic field, we observe a zero-field current
dip, attributed to the competition between the spin Zeeman effect and the
Kane-Mele spin-orbit interaction. Details of the line shape of this current dip
however, suggest additional underlying mechanisms are at play.

<h3>The overlooked role of band-gap parameter in characterization of Landau  levels in a gapped phase semi-Dirac system: the monolayer phosphorene case</h3>

Two-dimensional gapped semi-Dirac (GSD) materials are systems with a finite
band gap that their charge carriers behave relativistically in one direction
and Schr\"odinger-like in the other. In the present work, we show that besides
the two well-known energy bands features (curvature and chirality), the
band-gap parameter also play a crucial role in the index- and magnetic
field-dependence of the Landau levels (LLs) in a GSD system. We take the
monolayer phosphorene as a GSD representative example to explicitly provide
physical insights into the role of this parameter in determining the index- and
magnetic field-dependence of LLs. We derive an effective one-dimensional
Schr\"odinger equation for charge carriers in the presence of a perpendicular
magnetic field and argue that the form of its effective potential is clearly
sensitive to a dimensionless band-gap that is tunable by structural parameters.
The theoretical magnitude of this effective gap and its interplay with oval
shape $k$-space cyclotron orbits resolve the seeming contradiction in
determining the type of the quantum Hall effect in the pristine monolayer
phosphorene. Our results strongly confirm that the dependence of LLs on the
magnetic field in this GSD material is as conventional two-dimensional
semiconductor electron gases up to a very high field regime. Using the
strain-induced gap modification scheme, we show the field dependence of the LLs
continuously evolves into $B^{2/3}$ behavior, which holds for a gapless
semi-Dirac system. The highlighted role of the band-gap parameter may affect
the consequences of the band anisotropy in the physical properties of a GSD
material, including magnetotransport, optical conductivity, dielectric
function, and thermoelectric performance.

<h3>Phononic Bandgap Programming in Kirigami</h3>

This study investigates the programming of elastic wave propagation bandgaps
in a kirigami material by intentionally sequencing its constitutive mechanical
bits. Such sequencing exploits the multi-stable nature of the stretched
kirigami, allowing each mechanical bit to switch between two stable equilibria
with different external shapes (aka. "(0)" and "(1)" states). Therefore, by
designing the sequence of (0) and (1) bits, one can fundamentally change the
underlying periodicity and thus program the phononic bandgap frequencies. To
this end, this study develops an algorithm to identify the unique periodicities
generated by assembling "$n$-bit strings" consisting of $n$ mechanical bits.
Based on a simplified geometry of these $n$-bit strings, this study also
formulates a theory to uncover the rich mapping between input sequencing and
output bandgaps. The theoretical prediction and experiment results confirm that
the (0) and (1) bit sequencing is a versatile approach to programming the
phonic bandgap frequencies. Moreover, one can additionally fine-tune the
bandgaps by adjusting the global stretch. Overall, the results of this study
elucidate new strategies for programming the dynamic responses of architected
material systems.

Graphene is a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal showing interesting properties
as a result of its dispersion relation with both quasiparticles and quasiholes
or matter and anti-matter. We introduce a topological nodal ring semimetal in
graphene with a quantized quantum Hall response, a robust one-dimensional
chiral edge mode and a quadratic Fermi-liquid spectrum for the quasiparticles
and quasiholes in the bulk. The bulk band degeneracy at the Fermi energy is
protected through a Z2 symmetry related to the two spin polarizations of an
electron and a double-orthogonality structure in the sublattice and spin
quantum numbers of the two crossing eigenstates. The system may have
applications in nano-electronics and in quantum mechanical entanglement applied
to band theory.

A moving magnetic skyrmion exhibits transverse deflection. This so-called
skyrmion Hall effect has been explained by the Thiele equation. Here, we
provide an alternative interpretation of the skyrmion Hall effect based on the
dynamics of domain walls enclosing the skyrmion. We relate the
spin-torque-induced local rotation of the domain wall segments to the shift of
the skyrmion core, explaining the skyrmion Hall effect at the micromagnetic
level. Bases on our intuitive interpretation, we also show that the skyrmion
Hall effect can be suppressed by combining the spin-transfer and spin-orbit
torques, whereby removing the major obstacle to utilizing skyrmions in devices.

In this work, we have investigated the coexistance of volatile and
non-volatile memristive effects in epitaxial phase-separated
La$_{\text{0.5}}$Ca$_{\text{0.5}}$MnO$_{3}$ thin films. At low temperatures (50
K), we observed volatile resistive changes arising from self-heating effects in
the vicinity of a metal-to-insulator transition. At higher temperatures (140 K
and 200 K) we measured a combination of volatile and non-volatile effects
arising from the synergy between self-heating effects and
ferromagnetic-metallic phase growth induced by an external electrical field.
The results reported here add phase separated manganites to the list of
materials which can electrically mimic, on the same device, the behavior of
both neurons and synapses, a feature that might be useful for the development
of neuromorphic computing hardware

<h3>From Elastic Spin to Phonon Spin: Symmetry and Fundamental Relations</h3>

This note is mainly based on postgraduate lectures at Tongji University since
2020 spring. We firstly revisit the elastic spin and orbital angular momentum
[PNAS 115, 9951 (2018)] but more general by applying the Noether's theorem to
the Lagrangian of the elastic system, and by applying the symmetry argument in
the field theory. Then, fundamental relations between elastic energy flux and
elastic spin are uncovered. In particular cases, the wave spin is closely
related to the vorticity of energy flux and momentum. Secondly, we move forward
from the elastic spin to revisit the phonon spin [Fizika Tverdogo Tela 3, 2160
(1961)] by applying the second quantization to elastic fields. We show that the
uncovered phonon spin, a polarized elastic-vibration quanta, is generally not
restricted to transverse phonon modes, but applying to general phonon modes,
like the longitudinal phonon modes, surface phonon modes, hybridized phonon
modes and so on, regarded as a consequence of mode interferences. The elastic
spin and phonon spin originate from the local rotating of the field
polarization in time domain, not the local circulation (vorticity) of
displacement or velocity in space domain.

<h3>Thermodynamically consistent dynamic boundary conditions of phase field  models</h3>

<br>

We present a general, constructive method to derive thermodynamically
consistent models and consistent dynamic boundary conditions hierarchically
following the generalized Onsager principle. The method consists of two steps
in tandem: the dynamical equation is determined by the generalized Onsager
principle in the bulk firstly, and then the surface chemical potential and the
thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions are formulated subsequently by
applying the generalized Onsager principle at the boundary. The application
strategy of the generalized Onsager principle in two-step yields
thermodynamically consistent models together with the consistent boundary
conditions that warrant a non-negative entropy production rate (or equivalently
non-positive energy dissipation rate in isothermal cases) in the bulk as well
as at the boundary. We illustrate the method using phase field models of binary
materials elaborate on two sets of thermodynamically consistent dynamic
boundary conditions. These two types of boundary conditions differ in how the
across boundary mass flux participates in boundary surface dynamics. We then
show that many existing thermodynamically consistent, binary phase field models
together with their dynamic or static boundary conditions are derivable from
this method. As an illustration, we show numerically how dynamic boundary
conditions affect crystal growth in the bulk using a binary phase field model.

Cubic materials host high crystal symmetry and hence are not expected to
support anisotropy in transport phenomena. In contrast to this common
expectation, here we report an anomalous anisotropy of spin current can emerge
in the (001) film of Mn${_3}$Pt, a noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin source
with face-centered cubic structure. Such spin current anisotropy originates
from the intertwined time reversal-odd ($T$-odd) and time reversal-even
($T$-even) spin Hall effects. Based on symmetry analyses and experimental
characterizations of the current-induced spin torques in Mn${_3}$Pt-based
heterostructures, we find that the spin current generated by Mn${_3}$Pt (001)
exhibits exotic dependences on the current direction for all the spin
components, deviating from that in conventional cubic systems. We also
demonstrate that such an anisotropic spin current can be used to realize
low-power spintronic applications such as the efficient field-free switching of
the perpendicular magnetizations.

This chapter illustrates the use of defect physics as a conceptual and
theoretical framework for the understanding and design of battery materials. It
starts with the methodology for first-principles studies of defects in complex
transition-metal oxides. The chapter then considers defects that are activated
in a cathode material during synthesis, during measurements, and during battery
use. Through these cases, it discusses possible defect landscapes in the
material and their implications, guidelines for materials design via
defect-controlled synthesis, mechanisms for electronic and ionic conduction and
for electrochemical extraction and re-insertion, and effects of doping.
Specific examples are taken from recent systematic studies of defects in mixed
ionic-electronic conducting cathode materials.

<br>
<br>
In a low-disorder two-dimensional electron system, when two Landau levels of
opposite spin or pseudospin cross at the Fermi level, the dominance of the
exchange energy can lead to a ferromagnetic, quantum Hall ground state whose
gap is determined by the exchange energy and has skyrmions as its excitations.
This is normally achieved via applying either hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial
strain. We study here a very high-quality, low-density, two-dimensional hole
system, confined to a 30-nm-wide (001) GaAs quantum well, in which the two
lowest-energy Landau levels can be gate tuned to cross at and near filling
factor $\nu=1$. As we tune the field position of the crossing from one side of
$\nu=1$ to the other by changing the hole density, the energy gap for the
quantum Hall state at $\nu=1$ remains exceptionally large, and only shows a
small dip near the crossing. The gap overall follows a $\sqrt{B}$ dependence,
expected for the exchange energy. Our data are consistent with a robust quantum
Hall ferromagnet as the ground state.

Recently, a rich polymorphic behavior of ordered ground-state structures of
the asymmetric Wigner bilayer system has been identified. An evolutionary
ground-state search revealed roughly 60.000 possible ground-state structures in
a two-dimensional phase diagram spanned by the plate-to-plate separation
distance and the charge-asymmetry parameter of the system. Partly, the
ground-state phase diagram could be revealed by comparing structures by means
of bond-orientational order parameters. However, large fractions of the phase
diagram remained unclassified. Here, we propose a simple machine learning
approach based on principal component analysis and k-means clustering of order
parameters, to systematically analyze and compare all lattice structures in a
structural database, and we apply our approach to the previously obtained
structural data set of the asymmetric Wigner bilayer system. This allows us to
fill the white spots in the phase diagram and refine the classification of
previously described phases in the system.

In the search for new renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, Hydrogen is
one of the most promising candidates for clean energy production. But cheap
Hydrogen separation and storage is still a big challenge. Photoelectrochemical
devices look promising for the decomposition of the water molecule into
$2H_2+O_2$. Every day new materials and combinations are discovered or invented
to improve the efficiency of the complex total process. A necessary condition
for the photoelectrochemical process to work without a bias voltage is that the
minimum of the semiconductor conduction band (CBM) must be more positive than
the reduction potential $H^{+}$ to $H_2$, whereas the highest value of the
semiconductor valence band (VBM) must be more negative than the oxidation
potential of $H_2O$ to $O_2$. Thus, band alignment studies in interfaces of
semiconductors with water become of vital importance. In this work, first
principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in the all
electron and the pseudo potential approaches have been performed for the
analysis of the band alignment in $SrTaO_2N/H_2O$ interfaces. Different surface
terminations were analyzed, together with the dependence of the gap and band
alignment with lattice constants for systems grown on mismatched substrates.
Water structures were built from classical molecular dynamics and its
electronic structure calculated using DFT. The calculations show that the
$SrTaO_2N$ (001) is suitable for photoelectrochemical applications on a wide
range of lattice constant a, except for a compression/elongation of -2%, -1%
and 3%, while STN (110) results suitable for photoelectrochemical devices over
a wider range of lattice constants from -1% to 3%.

Diffusion is one of the most ubiquitous transport phenomena in nature.
Experimentally, it can be tracked by following point spreading in space and
time. Here, we introduce a spatiotemporal pump-probe microscopy technique that
exploits the residual spatial temperature profile obtained through the
transient reflectivity when probe pulses arrive before pump pulses. This
corresponds to an effective pump-probe time delay of 13 ns, determined by the
repetition rate of our laser system (76~MHz). This pre-time-zero technique
enables probing the diffusion of long-lived excitations created by previous
pump pulses with nanometer accuracy, and is particularly powerful for following
in-plane heat diffusion in thin films. In contrast to existing techniques for
quantifying thermal transport it does not require any material input parameters
or strong heating. We demonstrate the direct determination of the thermal
diffusivities of the layered materials MoSe$_2$ (0.18~cm$^2$/s), WSe$_2$
(0.20~cm$^2$/s), MoS$_2$ (0.35~cm$^2$/s), and WS$_2$ (0.59~cm$^2$/s). This
technique paves the way for observing novel nanoscale thermal transport
phenomena and tracking diffusion of a broad range of species.

<h3>Quantum phase transition in two-dimensional NbN superconducting thin  films</h3>

<br>
We systematically investigated the low-temperature transport properties of a
series of NbN epitaxial films with thickness $t$ ranging from $\sim$2.0 to
$\sim$4.0 nm. The films undergo a superconductor-insulator transition (SIT)
with decreasing film thickness, and the critical sheet resistance for the SIT
is close to the quantum resistance of Cooper pairs $h/4e^2$ (6.45 k$\Omega$).
Besides the Berezinski-Koterlitz-Thouless transition, a magnetic-field-driven
SIT is observed in those two-dimensional (2D) superconducting films (2.6 nm
$\lesssim t \lesssim 4.0$ nm). Interestingly, it is found that the
low-temperature magnetoresistance isotherms do not cross at a single fixed
point but at a well-distinguished region for these superconducting films. The
dynamical critical exponent obtained by analyzing these magnetoresistance
isotherms is divergent as the quantum critical point is being approached. The
behavior of the dynamical critical exponent, originating from quenched disorder
at ultralow temperatures, provides direct evidence for the occurrence of
quantum Griffiths singularity in the quantum phase transition process of the
films. The field-driven anomalous metal (quantum metal) state does not appear
in these films. Our results suggest that the quantum Griffiths singularity not
only occurs in the highly crystalline 2D superconductors with
superconductor-metal transition but also in those with SIT.

<br>
<br>
Magnetization reversal in ferro- and ferrimagnets is a well-known archetype
of non-equilibrium processes, where the volume fractions of the oppositely
magnetized domains vary and perfectly compensate each other at the coercive
magnetic field. Here, we report on a fundamentally new pathway for
magnetization reversal that is mediated by an antiferromagnetic state.
Consequently, an atomic-scale compensation of the magnetization is realized at
the coercive field, instead of the mesoscopic or macroscopic domain
cancellation in canonical reversal processes. We demonstrate this unusual
magnetization reversal on the Zn-doped polar magnet Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Hidden
behind the conventional ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop, the surprising emergence
of the antiferromagnetic phase at the coercive fields is disclosed by a sharp
peak in the field-dependence of the electric polarization. In addition, at the
magnetization reversal our THz spectroscopy studies reveal the reappearance of
the magnon mode that is only present in the pristine antiferromagnetic state.
According to our microscopic calculations, this unusual process is governed by
the dominant intralayer coupling, strong easy-axis anisotropy and spin
fluctuations, which result in a complex interplay between the ferrimagnetic and
antiferromagnetic phases. Such antiferro-state-mediated reversal processes
offer novel concepts for magnetization control, and may also emerge for other
ferroic orders.

<br>
Numerical simulations are used to examine the transition dynamics between
metastable and ground state vortex lattice phases in a system with combined
sixfold and twelvefold contributions to the vortex-vortex interactions. The
system is initially annealed using a a twelvefold anisotropy, yielding domain
of two different orientations and separated by grain boundaries. The
vortex-vortex interaction is then suddenly changed to a sixfold anisotropy,
rendering the twelvefold state metastable. Applying a drive that mimics an
oscillating magnetic field causes the metastable state to decay, indicated by
the structure factor that evolves from twelve to six peaks. The results fits
the behavior seen in recent small-angle neutron scattering studies of the
vortex lattice in MgB2. At higher drive amplitudes, the decay exhibits a two
step process in which the initial fast decrease is followed by a slower regime
where avalanches or bursts are correlated with defect annihilation events. The
results are compared to other types of metastable systems with quenched
disorder that decay under a periodic external drive.

Cold quantum gases, when acted upon by electromagnetic fields, can give rise
to samples where isolated atoms coexist with dimers or trimers, which raises
the question of the interactions between these various constituents. Here we
perform microwave photoassociation in a degenerate gas of $^{87}$Rb atoms to
create weakly-bound dimers in their electronic ground state. From the
density-induced shift of the photoassociation line, we measure the atom-dimer
scattering length for the two least-bound states of the molecular potential. We
also determine the complete energy diagram of one hyperfine manifold of the
least-bound state, which we accurately reproduce with a simple model.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in KTaO3-based
heterostructures, we study a pairing mechanism based on spin-orbit assisted
coupling between the conduction electrons and the ferroelectric modes present
in the material. We use ab initio frozen-phonon computations to show a
linear-in-momentum Rashba-like coupling with a strong angular dependence in
momentum for the lower j=3/2 manifold, deviating from the conventional
isotropic Rashba model. This implies the Rashba-like interaction with the polar
modes has substantial L=3 cubic harmonic corrections, which we quantify for
each electronic band. The strong anisotropy of the Rashba interaction is
captured by a microscopic toy model for the t2g electrons. We find its origin
to be the angular dependence in electronic momentum imposed by the kinetic term
on the degenerate j=3/2 manifold. A comparison between the toy model and ab
initio results indicate that additional symmetry allowed terms beyond
odd-parity spin-conserving inter-orbital hopping processes are needed to
describe the Rashba-like polar interaction between the electrons and the soft
ferroelectric mode.

diffusion is comparable with the time taken by the surface of the solid body to
saturate achieving a dynamical equilibrium between the diffusing elements
supplied by the external source and the ones transferred internally through the
diffusion kinetic mechanisms. Worked examples for constant diffusion

We consider a class of Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations suitable for
treating Hubbard interactions in the context of quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. A tunable parameter $p$ allows us to continuously vary from a
discrete Ising auxiliary field ($p=\infty$) to a compact auxiliary field that
couples to electrons sinusoidally ($p=0$). In tests on the single-band Hubbard
model, we find that the severity of the sign problem decreases systematically
with increasing $p$. Selecting $p$ finite, however, enables continuous sampling
methods like the Langevin or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods. We explore the
tradeoffs between various simulation methods through numerical benchmarks.

Recently Deyo et al. [\prb {\bf 106}, 104502 (2022)] suggested that the
surface resistance $R_s(H_0)$ of a superconductor under strong electromagnetic
field can be affected by field-induced quasiparticle bound states at the
surface. This Comment shows that the existence of such bound states and their
contribution to $R_s$ are not substantiated and the phenomenological models of
Ref. \cite{corn} give incorrect field and temperature dependencies of
$R_s(T,H_0)$.

Two different kinetic theories [J. Solsvik and E. Manger (SM-theory), Phys.
Fluids \textbf{33}, 043321 (2021) and V. Garz\'o, J. W. Dufty, and C. M. Hrenya
(GDH-theory), Phys. Rev. E \textbf{76}, 031303 (2007)] are considered to
determine the shear viscosity $\eta$ for a moderately dense granular binary
mixture of smooth hard spheres. The mixture is subjected to a simple shear flow
and heated by the action of an external driving force (Gaussian thermostat)
that exactly compensates the energy dissipated in collisions. The set of Enskog
kinetic equations is the starting point to obtain the dependence of $\eta$ on
the control parameters of the mixture: solid fraction, concentration, mass and
diameter ratios, and coefficients of normal restitution. While the expression
of $\eta$ found in the SM-theory is based on the assumption of Maxwellian
distributions for the velocity distribution functions of each species, the
GDH-theory solves the Enskog equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to
first order in the shear rate. To assess the accuracy of both kinetic theories,
the Enskog equation is numerically solved by means of the direct simulation
Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The simulation is carried out for a mixture under
simple shear flow, using the thermostat to control the cooling effects. Given
that the SM-theory predicts a vanishing kinetic contribution to the shear
viscosity, the comparison between theory and simulations is essentially made at
the level of the collisional contribution $\eta_c$ to the shear viscosity. The
results clearly show that the GDH-theory compares with simulations much better
than the SM-theory over a wide range of values of the coefficients of
restitution, the volume fraction, and the parameters of the mixture (masses,
diameters, and concentration).
