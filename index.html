<h3>Scissors Modes of a Bose-Einstein Condensate in a Synthetic Magnetic  Field</h3>

We study the scissors modes of a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein
condensate under the influence of a synthetic magnetic field, which induces
rigid rotational components in the velocity field. Our investigation reveals
that the scissors mode, excited in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic
magnetic field, becomes coupled to the quadrupole modes of the condensate,
giving rise to typical beating effects. Moreover, the two scissors modes
excited in the vertical planes are also coupled together by the synthetic
magnetic field, resulting in intriguing gyroscope dynamics. Our analytical
results, derived from a spinor hydrodynamic theory, are further validated
through numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. These predictions for the condensates subject to a synthetic magnetic
field are experimentally accessible with current cold-atom setups and hold
promise for potential applications in quantum sensing.

Temperature plays a very important role in various biological processes like
the evolution of life, as it is anticipated that early life existed in a very
hot environment that eventually cooled down with time. In vitro experiments,
conducted with various active matter systems in anisotropic temperature
environments, show several interesting outcomes. Motivated by these experiments
and some simulation results, we study the collective behavior of self-propelled
hard rods with excluded volume interactions, moving on a substrate in two
dimensions and subjected to a small but finite external temperature gradient.
Using a coarse-grained hydrodynamic approach, we explore the behavior of the
system in the steady state and the stability both in the passive and active
limits.

<h3>Binomial expansion for a linearized map with memory. A Final comment on:  "Criticality and the fractal structure of -5/3 turbulent cascades"</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02463</a>

In a recent paper by Cabrera et al (Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 2021 146
110876), a linearization of DRM differences equation, (Delayed Regulation
Model), has been proposed as a scheme to explain transfer of energy through
different scales in turbulence. They claim that this apparently simple model,
by replication of Kolmogorov power law of k ^ -5/3 scaling, remarks a key
mechanism of behaviour for more complex systems. Their proposal requires
computation of several products of random matrices, nevertheless they only
offer an onset of time evolution or an asymptotic approximation to all them.
Also it is suggested a fractal nature in the process of calculating the
successive characteristic polynomials of these products or the eigenvalues of
their associated self-adjoint matrices. Both questions are addressed in this
comment and are answered positively. A general formula for the evolution in
every step of mentioned stochastic linear approximation to DRM is found as well
a map from a binomial expansion of these matrices key products to a well
described fractal object.

<h3>Symmetry dictated universal helicity redistribution of Dirac fermions in  transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02474" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02474</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Helicity is a fundamental property of Dirac fermions. Yet, how it changes in
transport processes remains largely mysterious. We uncover, theoretically, the
rule of spinor state transformation and consequently universal helicity
redistribution in two cases of transport through potentials of electrostatic
and mass types, respectively. The former is dictated by Lorentz boost and its
complex counterpart in Klein tunneling regime. The latter is governed by an
abstract rotation group we identified, which reduces to SO(2) when acting on
the plane of effective mass and momentum. This endows an extra structure
foliating the Hilbert space of Dirac spinors, establishes miraculously a
unified yet latent connection between helicity, Klein tunneling, and Lorentz
boost. Our results thus deepen the understanding of relativistic quantum
transport, and may open a new window for exotic helicity-based physics and
applications in mesoscopic systems.

The possibility of stating the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the
increasing behaviour of a physical property establishes a connection between
that branch of physics and the theory of algebraic inequalities. We use this
connection to show how some well-known inequalities such as the standard bounds
for the logarithmic function or generalizations of Bernoulli's inequality can
be derived by thermodynamic methods. Additionally, we show that by comparing
the global entropy production in processes implemented with decreasing levels
of irreversibility but subject to the same change of state of one particular
system, we can find progressively better bounds for the real function that
represents the entropy variation of the system. As an application, some new
families of bounds for the function $\log(1+x)$ are obtained by this method.

<h3>Connecting the many-body Chern number to Luttinger's theorem through  Středa's formula</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02483</a>

<i>Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Subir Sachdev, Nathan Goldman</i>
<br>
<br>
Relating the quantized Hall response of correlated insulators to many-body
topological invariants is a key challenge in topological quantum matter. Here,
we use Streda's formula to derive an expression for the many-body Chern number
in terms of the single-particle interacting Green's function and its derivative
with respect to a magnetic field. In this approach, we find that this many-body
topological invariant can be decomposed in terms of two contributions, $N_3[G]
+ \Delta N_3[G]$, where $N_3[G]$ is known as the Ishikawa-Matsuyama invariant,
and where the second term involves derivatives of the Green's function and the
self energy with respect to the magnetic perturbation. As a by product, the
invariant $N_3[G]$ is shown to stem from the derivative of Luttinger's theorem
with respect to the probe magnetic field. These results reveal under which
conditions the quantized Hall conductivity of correlated topological insulators
is solely dictated by the invariant $N_3[G]$, providing new insight on the
origin of fractionalization in strongly-correlated topological phases.

<h3>Pressure control of magnetic order and excitations in the pyrochlore  antiferromagnet MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02496</a>
<br>
<i>L. S. Nassar, H. Lane, B. Haberl, M. Graves-Brook, B. Winn, S.M. Koohpayeh, M. Mourigal</i>
<br>
<br>
MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is one of the best-known realizations of the
pyrochlore-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The strong antiferromagnetic
exchange interactions are perturbed by small further-neighbor exchanges such
that this compound may in principle realize a spiral spin liquid (SSL) phase in
the zero-temperature limit. However, a spin Jahn-Teller transition below
$T_{\rm N} \approx 13$ K yields a complicated long-range magnetic order with
multiple coexisting propagation vectors. We present neutron scattering and
thermo-magnetic measurements of MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ samples under applied
hydrostatic pressure up to $P=1.7$ GPa demonstrating the existence of multiple
close-lying nearly degenerate magnetic ground states. We show that the
application of hydrostatic pressure increases the ordering temperature by
around 0.8 K per GPa and increases the bandwidth of the magnetic excitations by
around 0.5 meV per GPa. We also evidence a strong tendency for the preferential
occupation of a subset of magnetic domains under pressure. In particular, we
show that the $\boldsymbol{k}=(0,0,1)$ magnetic phase, which is almost
negligible at ambient pressure, dramatically increases in spectral weight under
pressure. This modifies the spectrum of magnetic excitations, which we
interpret unambiguously as spin waves from multiple magnetic domains. Moreover,
we report that the application of pressure reveals a feature in the magnetic
susceptibility above the magnetostructural transition. We interpret this as the
onset of a short-range ordered phase associated with $\boldsymbol{k}=(0,0,1)$,
previously not observed in magnetometry measurements.

<h3>Transverse Quantum Fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02501" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02501</a>
<br>
<i>Anatoly Kuklov, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Leo Radzihovsky, Boris Svistunov</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by remarkable properties of superfluid edge dislocations in solid
Helium-4, we discuss a broad class of quantum systems -- boundaries in phase
separated lattice states, magnetic domain walls, and ensembles of Luttinger
liquids -- that can be classified as Transverse Quantum Fluids (TQF). After
introducing the general idea of TQF, we focus on a coupled array of Luttinger
liquids forming an incoherent TQF. This state is a long-range ordered
quasi-one-dimensional superfluid, topologically protected against quantum phase
slips by tight-binding of instanton dipoles, that has no coherent
quasi-particle excitations at low energies. Incoherent TQF is a striking
example of the irrelevance of the Landau quasiparticle criterion for
superfluidity in systems that lack Galilean invariance. We detail its
phenomenology, to motivate a number of experimental studies in condensed matter
and cold atomic systems.

<h3>Geometric squeezing of rotating quantum gases into the lowest Landau  level</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02510</a>
<br>
<i>Valentin Crépel, Ruixiao Yao, Biswaroop Mukherjee, Richard J. Fletcher, Martin Zwierlein</i>
<br>
<br>
The simulation of quantum Hall physics with rotating quantum gases is
witnessing a revival due to recent experimental advances that enabled the
observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate entirely contained in its lowest
kinetic energy state, i.e. the lowest Landau level. We theoretically describe
this experimental result, and show that it can be interpreted as a squeezing of
the geometric degree of freedom of the problem, the guiding center metric. This
"geometric squeezing" offers an unprecedented experimental control over the
quantum geometry in Landau-level analogues, and at the same time opens a
realistic path towards achieving correlated quantum phases akin to quantum Hall
states with neutral atoms.

<h3>Efficient Simulation of Low Temperature Physics in One-Dimensional  Gapless Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02519</a>
<br>
<i>Yuya Kusuki, Kotaro Tamaoka, Zixia Wei, Yasushi Yoneta</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss the computational efficiency of the finite temperature simulation
with the minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). To argue that
METTS can be efficiently represented as matrix product states, we present an
analytic upper bound for the average entanglement Renyi entropy of METTS for
Renyi index $0<q\leq 1$. In particular, for 1D gapless systems described by
CFTs, the upper bound scales as $\mathcal{O}(c N^0 \log \beta)$ where $c$ is
the central charge and $N$ is the system size. Furthermore, we numerically find
that the average Renyi entropy exhibits a universal behavior characterized by
the central charge and is roughly given by half of the analytic upper bound.
Based on these results, we show that METTS provide a significant speedup
compared to employing the purification method to analyze thermal equilibrium
states at low temperatures in 1D gapless systems.

We introduce a natural way of visualizing the entropy production in heat
transfer processes between a system and a thermal reservoir. This

<h3>Design of Oscillatory Neural Networks by Machine Learning</h3>

<br>
<i>Tamas Rudner, Wolfgang Porod, Gyorgy Csaba</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the utility of machine learning algorithms for the design of
Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONNs). After constructing a circuit model of the
oscillators in a machine-learning-enabled simulator and performing
Backpropagation through time (BPTT) for determining the coupling resistances
between the ring oscillators, we show the design of associative memories and
multi-layered ONN classifiers. The machine-learning-designed ONNs show superior
performance compared to other design methods (such as Hebbian learning) and
they also enable significant simplifications in the circuit topology. We
demonstrate the design of multi-layered ONNs that show superior performance
compared to single-layer ones. We argue Machine learning can unlock the true
computing potential of ONNs hardware.

<br>
<i>Po-Hsin Shih, Thi-Nga Do, Godfrey Gumbs</i>
<br>
<br>
Carbon-based bilayer van der Waals (vdW) materials are attracting much
attention due to their predicted interesting physical properties. Here, we
theoretically investigate electronic and optical properties of C$_3$B/C$_3$N
vdW heterostructure (HTS) under external magnetic field and mechanical strain.
The tight-binding model of the system is constructed to include the
strain-induced modification of the hopping interactions. The influence of a
uniform perpendicular magnetic field is included by using the Peierls
substitution method. We observe the intriguing electronic and optical
characteristics of the HTS under mechanical strain, covering the band
inversion, alteration of band gap and optical gap, distortion of band-edge
states, as well as significant enhancement of optical absorption. Furthermore,
the interplay between external magnetic field and biaxial strain leads to
exotic features of quantization and optical spectra. This work provides
important information for the comprehension of the engineering of materials by
external effects. Our study suggests that C$_3$B/C$_3$N vdW HTS is a promising
candidate for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.

<br>
<br>
Designer heterostructures, where the desired physics emerges from the
controlled interactions between different components, represent one of the most
powerful strategies to realize unconventional electronic states. This approach
has been particularly fruitful in combining magnetism and superconductivity to
create exotic superconducting states. In this work, we use a heterostructure
platform combining supramolecular metal complexes (SMCs) with a quasi-2D van
der Waals (vdW) superconductor NbSe$_2$. Our scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) measurements demonstrate the emergence of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands
arising from the interaction between the SMC magnetism and the NbSe$_2$
superconductivity. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic
circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements, we show the presence of
antiferromagnetic coupling between the SMC units. These result in the emergence
of an unconventional $3\times3$ reconstruction in the magnetic ground state
that is directly reflected in real space modulation of the YSR bands. The
combination of flexible molecular building blocks, frustrated magnetic
textures, and superconductivity in heterostructures establishes a fertile
starting point to fabricating tunable quantum materials, including
unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids.

<h3>Magnetoplasmons in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02546</a>
<br>
<i>Thi-Nga Do, Po-Hsin Shih, Godrey Gumbs</i>
<br>
<br>
The magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) has been demonstrated to
exhibit exotic physical properties due to the special flat bands. However,
exploiting the engineering of such properties by external fields is still in it
infancy. Here we show that MATBLG under an external magnetic field presents a
distinctive magnetoplasmon dispersion, which can be significantly modified by
transferred momentum and charge doping. Along a wide range of transferred
momentum, there exist special pronounced single magnetoplasmon and horizontal
single-particle excitation modes near charge neutrality. We provide an
insightful discussion of such unique features based on the electronic
excitation of Landau levels quantized from the flat bands and Landau damping.
Additionally, charge doping leads to peculiar multiple strong-weight
magnetoplasmons. These characteristics make MATBLG a favorable candidate for
plasmonic devices and technology applications.

<h3>Relativistic magnetic interactions from non-orthogonal basis sets</h3>

<br>
<i>Gabriel Martínez-Carracedo, László Oroszlány, Amador García-Fuente, Bendegúz Nyári, László Udvardi, László Szunyogh, Jaime Ferrer</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a method to determine the magnetic exchange interaction and
on-site anisotropy tensors of extended Heisenberg spin models from density
functional theory including relativistic effects. The method is based on the
Liechtenstein-Katsnelson-Antropov-Gubanov torque formalism, whereby energy
variations upon infinitesimal rotations are performed. We assume that the
Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is expanded in a non-orthogonal basis set of
pseudo-atomic orbitals. We define local operators that are both hermitian and
satisfy relevant sum rules. We demonstrate that in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling a correct mapping from the density functional total energy to a spin
model that relies on the rotation of the exchange field part of the Hamiltonian
can not be accounted for by transforming the full Hamiltonian. We derive a set
of sum rules that pose stringent validity tests on any specific calculation. We
showcase the flexibility and accuracy of the method by computing the exchange
and anisotropy tensors of both well-studied magnetic nanostructures and of
recently synthesized two-dimensional magnets. Specifically, we benchmark our
approach against the established Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green's function method
and show that they agree well. Finally, we demonstrate how the application of
biaxial strain on the two-dimensional magnet T-CrTe2 can trigger a magnetic
phase transition.

<br>
<br>
Ce$_{3}$Bi$_{4}$Au$_{3}$ crystallizes in the same non-centrosymmetric cubic
structure as the prototypical Kondo insulator Ce$_{3}$Bi$_{4}$Pt$_{3}$. Here we
report the physical properties of Ce$_{3}$Bi$_{4}$Au$_{3}$ single crystals
using magnetization, thermodynamic, and electrical-transport measurements.
Magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity data reveal antiferromagnetic (AFM)
order below $T_N=3.2$ K. The magnetic entropy $S_{\rm mag}$ reaches $R$ln2
slightly above $T_N$, which suggests localized $4f$-moments in a doublet ground
state. Multiple field-induced magnetic transitions are observed at temperatures
below $T_N$, which indicate a complex spin structure with competing
interactions. Ce$_{3}$Bi$_{4}$Au$_{3}$ shows semimetallic behavior in
electrical resistivity measurements in contrast to the majority of reported
Cerium-based 343 compounds. Electrical-resistivity measurements under
hydrostatic pressure reveal a slight enhancement of $T_N$ under pressures up to
2.3 GPa, which supports a scenario wherein Ce$_{3}$Bi$_{4}$Au$_{3}$ belongs to
the far left of the Doniach phase diagram dominated by
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. Using realistic many-body
simulations, we confirm the semi-metallic electronic structure of
Ce$_{3}$Bi$_{4}$Au$_{3}$ and quantitatively reproduce its local moment behavior
in the paramagnetic state.

<br>
<br>
Among silicon-based solar cells, heterojunction cells hold the world
efficiency record. However, their market acceptance is hindered by an initial
0.5\% per year degradation of their open circuit voltage which doubles the
overall cell degradation rate. Here, we study the performance degradation of
crystalline-Si/amorphous-Si:H heterojunction stacks. First, we experimentally
measure the interface defect density over a year, the primary driver of the
degradation. Second, we develop SolDeg, a multiscale, hierarchical simulator to
analyze this degradation by combining Machine Learning, Molecular Dynamics,
Density Functional Theory, and Nudged Elastic Band methods with analytical
modeling. We discover that the chemical potential for mobile hydrogen develops
a gradient, forcing the hydrogen to drift from the interface, leaving behind
recombination-active defects. We find quantitative correspondence between the
calculated and experimentally determined defect generation dynamics. Finally,
we propose a reversed Si-density gradient architecture for the amorphous-Si:H
layer that promises to reduce the initial open circuit voltage degradation from
0.5\% per year to 0.1\% per year.

<h3>How to measure the free energy and partition function from atom-atom  correlations</h3>

We propose an experimental approach for determining thermodynamic properties
of ultracold atomic gases with short-range interactions. As a test case, we
focus on the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas described by the integrable
Lieb-Liniger model. The proposed approach relies on deducing the Helmholtz or
Landau free energy directly from measurements of local atom-atom correlations
by utilising the inversion of a finite-temperature version of the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem. We demonstrate this approach theoretically by
deriving approximate analytic expressions for the free energies in specific
asymptotic regimes of the 1D Bose gas and find excellent agreement with the
exact results based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz available for this
integrable model.

<br>

Using first-principles quantum-transport calculations, we investigate
spin-dependent electronic and transport properties of antiferromagnetic tunnel
junctions (AFMTJs) that consist of (110)-oriented antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal
RuO$_{2}$ electrodes and an insulating TiO$_{2}$ tunneling barrier. We predict
the emergence of a giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in a wide
energy window, a series of barrier layer thicknesses, and different interface
terminations, indicating the robustness of this effect. We show that the
predicted TMR cannot be explained in terms of the global transport
spin-polarization of RuO$_{2}$ (110) but is well understood based on matching
the momentum-dependent spin-polarized conduction channels of the two RuO$_{2}$
(110) electrodes. We predict oscillations of TMR with increasing barrier
thickness, indicating a non-negligible contribution from the perfectly
epitaxial interfaces. Our work helps the understanding of the physics of TMR in
AFMTJs and aids in realizing efficient AFM spintronic devices.

Machine learning-based molecular materials discovery has attracted enormous
attention recently due to its flexibility in dealing with black box models.
Yet, metaheuristic algorithms are not as widely applied to materials discovery
applications. We comprehensively compare 11 different optimization algorithms
for molecular materials design with targeted properties. These algorithms
include Bayesian Optimization (BO) and multiple metaheuristic algorithms. We
performed 5000 material evaluations repeated 5 times with different randomized
initialization to optimize defined target properties. By maximizing the bulk
modulus and minimizing the Fermi energy through perturbing parameterized
molecular representations, we estimated the unique counts of molecular
materials, mean density scan of the objectives space, mean objectives, and
frequency distributed over the materials' representations and objectives. GA,
GWO, and BWO exhibit higher variances for materials count, density scan, and
mean objectives; and BO and Runge Kutta optimization (RUN) display generally
lower variances. These results unveil that nature-inspired algorithms contain
more uncertainties in the defined molecular design tasks, which correspond to
their dependency on multiple hyperparameters. RUN exhibits higher mean
objectives whereas BO displayed low mean objectives compared with other
benchmarked methods. Combined with materials count and density scan, we propose
that BO strives to approximate a more accurate surrogate of the design space by
sampling more molecular materials and hence have lower mean objectives, yet RUN
will repeatedly sample the targeted molecules with higher objective values. Our
work shed light on automated digital molecular materials design and is expected
to elicit future studies on materials optimization such as composite and alloy
design based on specific desired properties.

In Nat Commun 13, 3194 (2022) [1], Minkov et al. reported magnetization
measurements on hydrides under pressure that claimed to find a diamagnetic
signal below a critical temperature demonstrating the existence of
superconductivity. Here we present an analysis of raw data recently released
[2] by the authors of [1] that shows that the measured data do not support
their claim that the samples exhibit a diamagnetic response indicative of
superconductivity. We also point out that Ref. [1] in its original form omitted
essential information that resulted in presentation of a distorted picture of
reality, and that important information on transformations performed on
measured data remains undisclosed. Our analysis also calls into question the
conclusions of Minkov et al's trapped flux experiments reported in Nat. Phys.
(2023) [3] as supporting superconductivity in these materials. This work
together with earlier work implies that there is no magnetic evidence for the
existence of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrides under pressure.

We investigate the dynamical relaxation behavior of the two-point correlation
in extended XY models with a gapless phase after quenches from various initial
states. Specifically, we study the XY chain with gapless phase induced by the
additional interactions: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and XZY-YZX type of
three-site interaction. When quenching from the gapped phase, we observe that
the additional interactions have no effect on the relaxation behavior. The
relaxation behavior is $\delta C_{mn}(t)\sim t^{-3/2}$ and $\sim t^{-1/2}$ for
the quench to the commensurate phase and the incommensurate phase,
respectively. However, when quenching from the gapless phase, we demonstrate
that the scaling behavior of $\delta C_{mn}(t)$ is changed to $\sim t^{-1}$ for
the quench to the commensurate phase, and the decay of $\delta C_{mn}(t)$
follows $\sim t^{-1}$ or $\sim t^{-1/2}$ for the quench to the incommensurate
phase depending on the parameters of pre-quench Hamiltonian. We also establish
the dynamical phase diagrams based on the dynamical relaxation behavior of
$\delta C_{mn}(t)$ in the extended XY models.

Magnetocaloric materials have received significant attention of research
community as they can minimize the use of harmful gases (CFCs, HFCs) and render
eco-friendly refrigeration. Heusler alloys (Ni2MnGa) are known for their
magnetocaloric effects, which make them useful as energy efficient and
eco-friendly refrigerating materials. Magnetocaloric properties significantly
depend on the composition of these alloys. Ni-Mn-Ga is one of the interesting
Heusler systems, which exhibits magnetocaloric properties. In the present
study, we performed the thermodynamic optimization of two sub binaries of the
Ni-Mn-Ga system: Mn-Ga and Ni-Ga, using CALPHAD approach. A Modified
Quasichemical Model (MQM) was used to describe the thermodynamic properties of
the liquid solutions in both the binaries. Both the binaries were combined with
Mn-Ni to develop a self-consistent thermodynamic database for Ni-Mn-Ga. In
order to resolve the existing experimental discrepancies in the Mn-Ga and Ni-Ga
system, few alloy compositions were prepared and analyzed using differential
thermal analysis. Finally, the developed thermodynamic database was used to
calculate the ternary isothermal section of the Ni-Mn-Ga (Heusler alloy) system
at 1073 K with a proposed phase region for magnetocaloric applications.

<h3>Correlated BCS wavefunction approach to unconventional superconductors</h3>

<br>

We propose a modified BCS wavefunction as the ground state of a correlated
superconductor with the correlation specified between $k$ and $-k$ electrons in
the reciprocal space. Owing to this correlation, low-energy excitations are not
conventional BCS Bogoliubov quasiparticles. They display at least four poles in
the Green's function and their particle-hole weights in the tunneling and
photon-emission spectrum become asymmetric. The superfluid density or
superfluid stiffness also deviates from the BCS predictions with finite
paramagnetic terms inside the total diamagnetic response. Moreover, a $d$-wave
correlated pairing state becomes robust against weak disorders. Hence, this
state can explain many mysterious features observed in unconventional
superconductors like cuprates.

<br>
In single unit-cell FeSe grown on SrTiO3, the superconductivity transition
temperature features a significant enhancement. Local phonon modes at the
interface associated with electron-phonon coupling may play an important role
in the interface-induced enhancement. However, such phonon modes have eluded
direct experimental observations. Indeed, the complicated atomic structure of
the interface brings challenges to obtain the accurate structure-phonon
relation knowledge from either experiment or theory, thus hindering our
understanding of the enhancement mechanism. Here, we achieve direct
characterizations of atomic structure and phonon modes at the FeSe/SrTiO3
interface with atomically resolved imaging and electron energy loss
spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We find several
phonon modes highly localized (~1.3 nm) at the unique double layer Ti-O
termination at the interface, one of which (~ 83 meV) engages in strong
interactions with the electrons in FeSe based on ab initio calculations. The
electron-phonon coupling strength for such a localized interface phonon with
short-range interactions is comparable to that of Fuchs-Kliewer (FK) phonon
mode with long-rang interactions. Thus, our atomic-scale study provides new
insights into understanding the origin of superconductivity enhancement at the
FeSe/SrTiO3 interface.

A Josephson junction may be in a stable odd parity state when a single
quasiparticle is trapped in an Andreev bound state. Embedding such junction in
an electromagnetic environment gives rise to a special quantum mechanics of
superconducting phase that we investigate theoretically. Our analysis covers
several representative cases, from the lifting of the supercurrent quench due
to quasiparticle poisoning for a low ohmic impedance of the environment, to a
Schmid transition in a current-biased junction that for odd parity occurs at
four times bigger critical impedance. For intermediate impedances, the
supercurrent in the odd state is higher than in the even one.

In the last decades, material discovery has been a very active research field
driven by the necessity of new materials for different applications. This has
also included materials incorporating heavy elements, beyond the stable
isotopes of lead. Most of actinides exhibit unique properties that make them
useful in various applications. Further, new heavy elements, taking the name of
super-heavy elements, have been synthesized, filling previously empty space of
Mendeleev periodic table. Their chemical bonding behaviour, of academic
interest at present, would also benefit of state-of-the-art modelling
approaches. In particular, in order to perform first-principles calculations
with planewave basis sets, one needs corresponding pseudopotentials. In this
work, we present a series of fully-relativistic optimised norm-conserving
Vanderbilt pseudopotentials (ONCVPs) for thirty-four actinides and super-heavy
elements. The scalar relativistic version of these ONCVPs is tested by
comparing equations of states for crystals, obtained with \textsc{abinit} 9.6,
with those obtained by all-electron zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA)
calculations performed with the Amsterdam Modelling Suite BAND code.
$\Delta$-Gauge and $\Delta_1$-Gauge indicators are used to validate these
pseudopotentials. This work is a contribution to the PseudoDojo project, in
which pseudopotentials for the whole periodic table are developed and
systematically tested. The fully-relativistic pseudopotential files (i.e.
including spin-orbit coupling) are available on the PseudoDojo web-interface
pseudo-dojo.org under the name NC FR (ONCVPSP) v4.x. Pseudopotentials are made
available in psp8 and UPF2 formats, both convenient for \textsc{abinit}, the
latter being also suitable for Quantum ESPRESSO.

<h3>Topology of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets</h3>

Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal
nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly.
Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model
which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets
of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k}
\boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and
bottom electronic surface states that become gapped due to the material's small
thickness. However, we find that the four-band model for the surface states
alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional theory, is inadequate for
the description of thin films of a few quintuple layers and even yields an
incorrect topological invariant within a significant range of thicknesses. To
address this limitation we propose an eight-band model which, in addition to
the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk bands closest to the
Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only captures most of the
experimental observations, but also agrees with previous first-principles
calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films of varying
thickness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the topological properties of thin
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets emerge as a result of an intricate interplay between
the surface and bulk states, which in fact results in nontrivial Chern numbers
for the latter.

<h3>The field dependence of electron effective mass in uranium  superconductors</h3>

The magnetic field dependence of electron effective mass is an important
subject in consideration of physical properties of superconducting ferromagnets
URhGe, UCoGe and paramagnet UTe$_2$. It is usually accepted to find this
dependence from the field dependence of $A$ coefficient in the low temperature
resistivity law $\rho=\rho_0+AT^2$. It is shown here that the field dependence
$A(H)$ takes place also for field-independent effective mass. Whether or not
the effective mass depends on the magnetic field can be checked by the
measurements of the amplitude of de Haas - van Alphen magnetisation
oscillations.

The electrical characterisation of classical and quantum devices is a
critical step in the development cycle of heterogeneous material stacks for
semiconductor spin qubits. In the case of silicon, properties such as disorder
and energy separation of conduction band valleys are commonly investigated
individually upon modifications in selected parameters of the material stack.
However, this reductionist approach fails to consider the interdependence
between different structural and electronic properties at the danger of
optimising one metric at the expense of the others. Here, we achieve a
significant improvement in both disorder and valley splitting by taking a
co-design approach to the material stack. We demonstrate isotopically-purified,
strained quantum wells with high mobility of 3.14(8)$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs
and low percolation density of 6.9(1)$\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$. These low
disorder quantum wells support quantum dots with low charge noise of 0.9(3)
$\mu$eV/Hz$^{1/2}$ and large mean valley splitting energy of 0.24(7) meV,
measured in qubit devices. By striking the delicate balance between disorder,
charge noise, and valley splitting, these findings provide a benchmark for
silicon as a host semiconductor for quantum dot qubits. We foresee the
application of these heterostructures in larger, high-performance quantum
processors.

<h3>Extended Quasicontinuum Methodology for Highly Heterogeneous Discrete  Systems</h3>

Lattice networks are indispensable to study heterogeneous materials such as
concrete or rock as well as textiles and woven fabrics. Due to the discrete
character of lattices, they quickly become computationally intensive. The
QuasiContinuum (QC) Method resolves this challenge by interpolating the
displacement of the underlying lattice with a coarser finite element mesh and
sampling strategies to accelerate the assembly of the resulting system of
governing equations. In lattices with complex heterogeneous microstructures
with a high number of randomly shaped inclusions the QC leads to an almost
fully-resolved system due to the many interfaces. In the present study the QC
Method is expanded with enrichment strategies from the eXtended Finite Element
Method (XFEM) to resolve material interfaces using nonconforming meshes. The
goal of this contribution is to bridge this gap and improve the computational
efficiency of the method. To this end, four different enrichment strategies are
compared in terms of their accuracy and convergence behavior. These include the
Heaviside, absolute value, modified absolute value and the corrected XFEM
enrichment. It is shown that the Heaviside enrichment is the most accurate and
straightforward to implement. A first-order interaction based summation rule is
applied and adapted for the extended QC for elements intersected by a material
interface to complement the Heaviside enrichment. The developed methodology is
demonstrated by three numerical examples in comparison with the standard QC and
the full solution. The extended QC is also able to predict the results with 5
percent error compared to the full solution, while employing almost one order
of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than the standard QC and even more
compared to the fully-resolved system.

We report observation of more than an order of magnitude jump in saturation
magnetization in BiFeO$_3$/Ag nanocomposite at room temperature compared to
what is observed in bare BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles. Using transmission electron
microscopy together with energy dispersive x-ray spectra (which maps the
element concentration across the BiFeO$_3$/Ag interface) and x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, we show that both the observed specific
self-assembly pattern of BiFeO$_3$ and Ag nanoparticles and the charge transfer
between Ag and O are responsible for such an enormous rise in room-temperature
magnetization. The BiFeO$_3$/Ag nanocomposites, therefore, could prove to be
extremely useful for a variety of applications including biomedical.

Raman spectroscopy uses light scattering to extract information on low-energy
excitations of solids. The Raman process is described by diagrams which are
fourth order in the light-matter interaction, and in particular the resonant
contribution, which involves four different space-time arguments, is difficult
to evaluate. If one instead simulates explicitly the incoming (classical) light
pulse, the Raman signal is given by the outgoing photon flux and can be
determined from a two-point correlation function. Such a formalism can be used
to compute the time-resolved Raman spectrum of non-equilibrium systems, as well
as nonlinear signals which are higher order in the incoming field, such as
hyper Raman scattering. Here we explain how to implement this time-dependent
formalism within the dynamical mean field theory framework. The method is
illustrated with applications to the Holstein-Hubbard model in the strong
electron-phonon coupling regime. We demonstrate hyper Raman scattering in
measurements with strong probe fields and frequency mixing signals in the
presence of a pump field, and simulate the evolution of Stokes and anti-Stokes
features after photo-excitations of metallic and Mott insulating systems.

<h3>Time-dependent properties of run-and-tumble particles. II.: Current  fluctuations</h3>

<br>
<i>Tanmoy Chakraborty, Punyabrata Pradhan</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate steady-state current fluctuations in two models of
run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) on a ring of $L$ sites, for \textit{arbitrary}
tumbling rate $\gamma=\tau_p^{-1}$ and density $\rho$; model I consists of
standard hardcore RTPs, while model II is an analytically tractable variant of
model I, called long-ranged lattice gas (LLG). We show that, in the limit of
$L$ large, the fluctuation of cumulative current $Q_i(T, L)$ across $i$th bond
in a time interval $T \gg 1/D$ grows first {\it subdiffusively} and then {\it
diffusively} (linearly) with $T$, where $D$ is the bulk diffusion coefficient.
Remarkably, regardless of the model details, the scaled bond-current
fluctuations $D \langle Q_i^2(T, L) \rangle/2 \chi L \equiv {\cal W}(y)$ as a
function of scaled variable $y=DT/L^2$ collapse onto a {\it universal} scaling
curve ${\cal W}(y)$, where $\chi(\rho,\gamma)$ is the collective particle {\it
mobility}. In the limit of small density and tumbling rate $\rho, \gamma
\rightarrow 0$ with $\psi=\rho/\gamma$ fixed, there exists a scaling law: The
scaled mobility $\gamma^{a} \chi(\rho, \gamma)/\chi^{(0)} \equiv {\cal H}
(\psi)$ as a function of $\psi$ collapse onto a scaling curve ${\cal H}(\psi)$,
where $a=1$ and $2$ in models I and II, respectively, and $\chi^{(0)}$ is the
mobility in the limiting case of symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP). For
model II (LLG), we calculate exactly, within a truncation scheme, both the
scaling functions, ${\cal W}(y)$ and ${\cal H}(\psi)$. We also calculate
spatial correlation functions for the current, and compare our theory with
simulation results of model I; for both models, the correlation functions decay
exponentially, with correlation length $\xi \sim \tau_p^{1/2}$ diverging with
persistence time $\tau_p \gg 1$. Overall our theory is in excellent agreement
with simulations and complements the findings of Ref. {\it arXiv:2209.11995}.

A novel spin texture formed by Cooper pair spins is found theoretically with
a phase string attached by half-quantized vortices at both ends in a unit cell
and characterized by its topologically rich vortex structure in a spin-triplet
pairing. It is stable at an intermediate field region sandwiched by two
conventional singular vortex phases below and above it. The d-vector direction
of this spin texture is tilted from the principal crystal axes, whose spin
susceptibility is neither the normal Pauli one \c{hi}N nor zero, describing
microscopically the process of the d-vector rotation phenomena observed
recently in UTe2. We compare the spin texture and singular vortex state in
relation to the quasi-particle structure with Majorana zero modes for STM, the
nuclear spin resonance spectral line width for NMR and {\mu}SR, and the vortex
form factors for SANS to facilitate the identification of the pairing symmetry
in UTe2.

<br>
<br>
The spin phenomena observed at a clean metall-insulator interface are
typically reduced to Rashba-Edelstein effect, that leads to spin accumulation
over a few monolayers. We demonstrate that the presence of interface disorder
significantly expands the range of potential phenomena. Specifically, the skew
scattering at the metal - insulator boundary gives rise to the "kinetic
Rashba-Edelstein effect", where spin accumulation occurs on a much larger
length scale comparable to mean free path. Moreover, at higher orders of
spin-orbit interaction, skew scattering is accompanied with spin relaxation
resulting in the interface spin-Hall effect - a conversion of electrical
current to spin current at the metal surface. Unlike the conventional spin-Hall
effect, this phenomenon persists even within the Born approximation. These two
predicted phenomena can dominate the spin density and spin current in devices
of intermediate thickness.

Bilayer borophene, very recently synthesized on Ag and Cu, possesses
extremely flat large surface and excellent conductivity. Besides, the van der
Waals gap of bilayer borophene can be intercalated by metal atoms, thereby
tailoring the properties of bilayer borophene. Herein, we propose that
sandwiched B/TM/B (TM=Co, Ni, Cu, Pd) could be a new 2D formation by transiton
metal atoms intercalated into bilayer borophene network, it is quiet robust
with both energetic, structural and thermal stability, and exhibits heat
resistance of at least 1300 K. Besides, it is novel platform for
electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The interecalation metal
atom serves as single-atomic catalyst, which acting the nonmetal boron layers.
Beyond that, the transtion metal is protected by outside boron layers from
being corroded by acidic/alkaline solution. B/Cux/B, B/Pdx/B and B/Alx/B with
different metal coverage exhibit defect-independent extremely low HER free
energy in the range of -0.162 ~ 0.179 eV, -0.134 ~ 0.183 eV and -0.082 ~ 0.086
eV which are comparable to noble metal Pt. Combining excellent conduction, high
structural and thermal stability, low resistance to intercalated behaviour,
effortless water splitting process, excellent defect-independent catalytic
performance, cheapness and abundance of raw materials, free of corrodation, 2D
sandwiched B/TM/B (TM=Co, Ni, Cu, Pd) is believed to promising for
electrocatalytic HER applications.

Irradiation of solid surfaces with high intensity, ultrashort laser pulses
triggers a variety of secondary processes that can lead to the formation of
transient and permanent structures over large range of length scales from mm
down to the nano-range. One of the most prominent examples are LIPSS - Laser
Induced Periodic Surface Structures. While LIPSS have been a scientific
evergreen for of almost 60 years, experimental methods that combine ultrafast
temporal with the required nm spatial resolution have become available only
recently with the advent of short pulse, short wavelength free electron lasers.
Here we discuss the current status and future perspectives in this field by
exploiting the unique possibilities of these 4th-generation light sources to
address by time-domain experimental techniques the fundamental LIPSS-question,
namely why and how laser-irradiation can initiate the transition of a "chaotic"

Facing with grave climate change and enormous energy demand, catalyzer gets
more and more important due to its significant effect on reducing fossil fuels
consumption. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) by water splitting are feasible ways to produce clean sustainable energy.
Here we systematically explored atomic structures and related STM images of Se
defects in PtSe2. The equilibrium fractions of vacancies under variable
conditions were detailly predicted. Besides, we found the vacancies are highly
kinetic stable, without recovering or aggregation. The Se vacancies in PtSe2
can dramatically enhance the HER performance, comparing with, even better than
Pt(111). Beyond, we firstly revealed that PtSe2 monolayer with Se vacancies is
also a good OER catalyst. The excellent bipolar catalysis of Se vacancies were
further confirmed by experimental measurements. We produced defective PtSe2 by
direct selenization of Pt foil at 773 K using a CVD process. Then we observed
the HER and OER performance of defective PtSe2 is much highly efficient than Pt
foils by a series of measurements. Our work with compelling theoretical and
experimental studies indicates PtSe2 with Se defects is an ideal bipolar
candidate for HER and OER.

<br>
We report on the optical characterization of non-magnetic metal/ferromagnetic
(Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$)/MgO heterostructures and interfaces by using mid
infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. We extracted for the
mid-infrared range the dielectric function of Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$, that
is lacking in literature, from a multisample analysis. From the optical
modelling of the heterostructures we detected and determined the dielectric
tensor properties of a two-dimensional gas (2DEG) forming at the non-magnetic
metal and the CoFeB interface. These properties comprise independent Drude
parameters for the in-plane and out-of plane tensor components, with the latter
having an epsilon-near-zero frequency within our working spectral range. A
feature assigned to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is identified. Furthermore, it is
found that both, the interfacial properties, 2DEG Drude parameters and SOC
strength, and the apparent dielectric function of the MgO layer depend on the
type of the underlying nonmagnetic metal, namely, Pt, W, or Cu. The results
reported here should be useful in tailoring novel phenomena in such types of
heterostructures by assessing their optical response noninvasively,
complementing existing characterization tools such as angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, and those related to electron/spin transport.

<h3>Shaping magnetization dynamics in a planar square dot by adjusting its  surface anisotropy</h3>

<i>Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos</i>
<br>
<br>
A planar square dot is one of the simplest structures confined to three
dimensions. Despite its geometrical simplicity, the description of the spin
wave modes in this structure is not trivial due to the competition of dipolar
and exchange interactions. An additional factor that makes this description
challenging are the boundary conditions depend both on non-local dipolar
interactions and local surface parameters such as surface anisotropy. In the
presented work, we showed how the surface anisotropy applied at the lateral
faces of the dot can tune the frequency of fundamental mode in the planar CoFeB
dot, magnetized in an out-of-plane direction. Moreover, we analyzed the spin
wave profile of the fundamental mode and the corresponding dynamic stray field.
We showed that the asymmetric application of surface anisotropy produces an
asymmetric profile of dynamic stray field for square dot and can be used to
tailor inter-dot coupling. The calculations were performed with the use of the
finite-element method.

We describe the chiral Kondo chain model based on the symplectic Kondo effect

non-Abelian anyons. We show that the fusion channel of two arbitrary anyons can
be detected by locally coupling the two anyons to an extra single channel of
chiral current and measuring the corresponding conductance at finite frequency.
Based on such measurements, we propose that the chiral Kondo chain model with
symplectic symmetry can be used for implementation of measurement-only
topological quantum computations, and it possesses a number of distinct
features favorable for such applications. The sources and effects of errors in
the proposed system are analyzed, and possible material realizations are
discussed.

We theoretically investigate influences of electronic circuit delay, noise
and temperature on write-error-rate (WER) in voltage-controlled magnetization
switching operation of a magnetic-topological-insulator-based (MTI) device by
means of the micromagnetic simulation. This device realizes magnetization
switching via spin-orbit torque(SOT) and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy
(VCMA) which originate from 2D-Dirac electronic structure. We reveal that the
device operation is extremely robust against circuit delay and signal-to-noise
ratio. We demonstrate that the WER on the order of approximately $10^{-4}$ or
below is achieved around room temperature due to steep change in VCMA. Also, we
show that the larger SOT improves thermal stability factor. This study provides
a next perspective for developing voltage-driven spintronic devices with
ultra-low power consumption.

Recently there is considerable interest to realize efficient and low-cost
true random number generators (RNGs) for practical applications. One important
way is through the use of bistable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here we
study the magnetization dynamics of an MTJ, with a focus to realize efficient
random bit generation under the assumption that the orientation dependence of
the energy of the nanomagnet is described by two perpendicular in-plane
anisotropies. We find that a high rate of random bit generation is achievable
away from the pure easy-axis situation by tuning a single parameter $H_z$ so
that it is either (a) toward a barrierless-like single easy plane situation
when $H_z$ reduces to zero, or (b) toward a stronger easy plane situation when
$H_z$ becomes increasingly negative where transitions between low energy states
are confined in the stronger easy plane that contains the saddle points. We
find that the MTJs maintain their fast magnetization dynamical characteristics
even in the presence of a magnetic field. Our findings provide a valuable guide
to achieving efficient generation of probabilistic bits for applications in
probabilistic computing.

<h3>Spin-lattice couplings in a skyrmion multilayers of Pd-Fe/Ir(111)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Pd-Fe/Ir(111) has attracted tremendous attention for next-generation
spintronics devices due to existence of magnetic skyrmions with the external
magnetic field. Our density functional theoretical calculations in combination
with spin dynamics simulation suggest that the spin spiral phase in fcc stacked
Pd-Fe/Ir(111) flips into the skyrmion lattice phase around B$_{ext} \sim$ 6 T.
This leads to the microscopic understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic
behaviours affected by the intrinsic spin-lattice couplings (SLCs) in this
skyrmion material for magneto-mechanical properties. Here we calculate fully
relativistic SLC parameters from first principle computations and investigate
the effect of SLC on dynamical magnetic interactions in skyrmion multilayers
Pd-Fe/Ir(111). The exchange interactions arising from next nearest-neighbors
(NN) in this material are highly frustrated and responsible for enhancing
skyrmion stability. We report the larger spin-lattice effect on both dynamical
Heisenberg exchanges and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions for next NN
compared to NN which is in contrast with recently observed spin-lattice effect
in bulk bcc Fe and CrI$_3$ monolayer. Based on our analysis, we find that the
effective measures of SLCs in fcc (hcp) stacking of Pd-Fe/Ir(111) are $\sim
2.71 ( \sim 2.36)$ and $\sim 14.71 ( \sim21.89)$ times stronger for NN and next
NN respectively, compared to bcc Fe. The linear regime of displacement for SLC
parameters is $\leq$ 0.02 {\AA} which is 0.72\% of the lattice constant for
Pd-FeIr(111). The microscopic understanding of SLCs provided by our current
study could help in designing spintronic devices based on thermodynamic
properties of skyrmion multilayers.

Ultraflat bands have already been detected in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG)
and twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (tb-TMDs), which provide a
platform to investigate strong correlations. In this paper, the electronic
properties of twisted trilayer molybdenum disulfide (TTM) are investigated via
an accurate tight-banding Hamiltonian. We find that the highest valence bands
are derived from $\Gamma$-point of the constituent monolayer, exhibiting a
graphene-like dispersion or becoming isolated flat bands. The lattice
relaxation, local deformation, and electric field can significantly tune the
electronic structures of TTM with different starting stacking arrangements.
After introducing the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect, we find a
spin-valley-layer locking effect at the minimum of conduction band at K- and
K$^\prime$-point of the Brillouin zone, which may provide a platform to study
optical properties and magnetoelectric effects.

Spin qubits have attracted tremendous attention in the effort of building
quantum computers over the years. Natural atomic scale candidates are group-V
dopants in silicon, not only showing ultra-long lifetimes but also being
compatible with current semiconductor technology. Nevertheless, bulk dopants
are difficult to move with atomic precision, impeding the realization of
desired structures for quantum computing. A solution is to place the atom on
the surface which opens possibilities for atom level manipulations using
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). For this purpose, bismuth appears to be a
good candidate. Here, we use ab-initio methods to study theoretically the
adsorption of bismuth atoms on the Si(001) surface and investigate the
adsorption sites and the transitions between them. We demonstrate the complex
influence of the dimer row surface reconstruction on the energy landscape seen
by a bismuth monomer and a dimer on the surface, and find anisotropic
transition paths for movement on the surface. From a deposition simulation we
obtain the expected occupation of adsorption sites. Our work lays the
foundation for further application of bismuth atoms as qubits on silicon
surfaces.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic insulators such as yttrium iron garnets (YIGs) are of paramount
importance for spin-wave or magnonic devices as their ultralow damping enables
ultralow power dissipation that is free of Joule heating, exotic magnon quantum
state, and coherent coupling to other wave excitations. Magnetic insulator
heterostructures bestow superior structural and magnetic properties and house
immense design space thanks to the strong and engineerable exchange interaction
between individual layers. To fully unleash their potential, realizing low
damping and strong exchange coupling simultaneously is critical, which often
requires high quality interface. Here, we show that such a demand is realized
in an all-insulator thulium iron garnet (TmIG)/YIG bilayer system. The ultralow
dissipation rates in both YIG and TmIG, along with their significant spin-spin
interaction at the interface, enable strong and coherent magnon-magnon coupling
with a benchmarking cooperativity value larger than the conventional
ferromagnetic metal-based heterostructures. The coupling strength can be tuned
by varying the magnetic insulator layer thickness and magnon modes, which is
consistent with analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations. Our
results demonstrate TmIG/YIG as a novel platform for investigating hybrid
magnonic phenomena and open opportunities in magnon devices comprising
all-insulator heterostructures.

The spin degree of freedom of charge carriers in halide-perovskite
semiconductors can be highly useful for information photonics applications. The
Faraday effect is known to be the best indicator of paramagnetism of the
material and of the spin-light interaction. In this work, the Faraday effect is
demonstrated, for the first time, in a hybrid organic-inorganic halide
perovskite MAPbI3 (MA+=CH3NH+3). The Faraday rotation and birefringence were
measured across the tetragonal-cubic phase transition at 327 K. The Faraday
rotation is strongly suppressed below the phase transition temperature due to
anisotropy (linear birefringence) of the tetragonal crystal phase. The
situation changes drastically above the phase transition temperature, when the
crystal becomes optically isotropic. The emerging Faraday rotation obeys the
Curie law, demonstrating its population-related paramagnetic nature. This
observation opens new prospects for application of these systems and for their
investigations using methods of the polarization noise spectroscopy applicable
to optically anisotropic materials.

The quest to identify and observe Majorana fermions in physics and
condensed-matter systems remains an important challenge. Here, we introduce a
qubit (spin-1/2) from the occurrence of two delocalized zero-energy Majorana
fermions in a model of two spins-1/2 on the Bloch sphere within the fractional
one-half topological state. We address specific protocols in time with
circularly polarized light and the protection of this spin-1/2 state related to
quantum information protocols. We also show how disorder can play a positive
and important role allowing singlet-triplet transitions and resulting in an
additional elongated region for the fractional phase, demonstrating the
potential of this platform related to applications in topologically protected
quantum information.

We discuss modern ideas in Monte Carlo algorithms in the simplified setting
of the one-dimensional anharmonic oscillator. After reviewing the connection
between molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo, we introduce to the Metropolis and
the factorized Metropolis algorithms and to lifted non-reversible Markov
chains. We furthermore illustrate the concept of thinning, where moves are
accepted by simple bounding potentials rather than, in our case, the harmonic
and quartic constituents of the anharmonic oscillator. We point out the
multiple connections of our example algorithms with real-world sampling
problems. The paper is fully self-contained and Python implementations are
provided.

<h3>Normal mode decomposition of atomic motion in solids</h3>

Decomposition of atomic motion into individual normal modes has led to
remarkable success in microscopically understanding thermal properties and
thermodynamics in simple solids. We start this chapter with an example of
decomposing atomic motion of a simple monatomic linear chain crystal into
normal modes followed by a more general, classical normal mode formalism.
Different classifications of normal modes such as phonons, propagons,
diffusons, and locons are introduced. Finally, heat capacity and thermal
conductivity predictions from the normal mode formalism are demonstrated.

<h3>Harmonic chain far from equilibrium: single-file diffusion, long-range  order, and hyperuniformity</h3>

In one-dimensional many-particle systems, diffusion is strongly suppressed
because particles cannot bypass each other. For this reason, the mean-square
displacement (MSD) increases in proportion to the square of time, ${\rm
MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2}$ in equilibrium. This phenomenon is called single-file
diffusion. Single-file diffusion is observed even in the harmonic lattice,
which prevents the existence of long-range order in one dimension. We here
study single-file diffusion of the harmonic chain far from equilibrium. We
consider the following four types of driving forces that do not satisfy the
detailed balance: (i) temporally correlated noise with the power-low
Fourier-spectrum $D(\omega)\sim \omega^{-2\alpha}$, (ii) center-of-mass
conserving noise, (iii) periodic driving force, and (iv) periodic deformations
of particles. For the driving force (i) with $\alpha>-1/4$, we observe ${\rm
MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2+2\alpha}$ for large $t$. On the other hand, for the driving
forces (i) with $\alpha<-1/4$ and (ii)-(iv), ${\rm MSD}$ remains finite. As a
consequence, the harmonic chain exhibits the long-range order even in one
dimension, which is prohibited by the Mermin-Wagner theorem in equilibrium. We
also discuss that the model shows hyperuniformity when driven by the driving
forces (i) with $\alpha<0$ and (ii)-(iv).

We report measurements of the Nernst and Seebeck effects in
Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ thin films near the superconducting transition
temperature, $T$ = 6.5 - 15 K. Our main result is the observation of a
vortex-Nernst signal $S_{yx}(T,H)$ with a maximum at $\mu_0H$ = 5 T and a tail
that extends to $\mu_0H$ $\approx$ 15 T, which we identify as the
upper-critical field $H_{c2}$. At $T > T_{\rm c} =$ 6.1 K, $H_{c2}$ remains
large (15 T), up to the highest temperature we can resolve from $S_{yx}$ (11
K). These results indicate the existence of a vortex-liquid state over a wide
range of finite-resistance temperatures, as in the high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates.

<h3>Optical pulse induced ultrafast antiferrodistortive transition in SrTiO3</h3>

<br>
<br>
The ultrafast dynamics of the antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase transition in
perovskite SrTiO3 is monitored via time-domain Brillouin scattering. Using
femtosecond optical pulses, we induce a thermally driven tetragonal-to-cubic
structural transformation and detect notable changes in the frequency of
Brillouin oscillations (BO) induced by propagating acoustic phonons. First, we
establish a fingerprint frequency of different regions across the temperature
phase diagram of the AFD transition characterized by tetragonal and cubic
phases in the low and high temperature sides, respectively. Then, we
demonstrate that in a sample nominally kept in tetragonal phase, deposition of
sufficient thermal energy induces an instantaneous transformation of the
heat-affected region to the cubic phase. Coupling the measured depth-resolved
BO frequency with a time and depth-resolved heat diffusion model, we detect a
reverse cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation occurring on a time scale of
hundreds of picoseconds. We attribute this ultrafast phase transformation in
the perovskite to a structural resemblance between atomic displacements of the
R-point soft optic mode of the cubic phase and the tetragonal phase, both
characterized by anti-phase rotation of oxygen octahedra. Evidence of such a
fast structural transition in perovskites can open up new avenues in the field
of information processing and energy storage.

The study of geometrically frustrated many-body quantum systems is of central
importance to uncover novel quantum mechanical effects. We design a scheme
where ultracold bosons trapped in a one-dimensional state-dependent optical
lattice are modeled by a frustrated Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. A derivation of
the Hamiltonian parameters based on Cesium atoms, further show large tunability
of contact and nearest-neighbour interactions. For pure contact repulsion, we
discover the presence of two phases peculiar to frustrated quantum magnets: the
bond-order-wave insulator with broken inversion symmetry and a chiral
superfluid. When the nearest-neighbour repulsion becomes sizeable, a further
density-wave insulator with broken translational symmetry can appear. We show
that the phase transition between the two spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases
is continuous, thus representing a one-dimensional deconfined quantum critical
point not captured by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm.
Our results provide a solid ground to unveil the novel quantum physics induced
by the interplay of non-local interactions, geometrical frustration, and
quantum fluctuations.
