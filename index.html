<h3>Hydrodynamics of dipole-conserving fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06848" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06848</a>

Dipole-conserving fluids serve as examples of kinematically constrained
systems that can be understood on the basis of symmetry. They are known to
display various exotic features including glassy-like dynamics, subdiffusive
transport and immobile excitations dubbed fractons. Unfortunately, such systems
have so far escaped a complete macroscopic formulation as viscous fluids. In
this work, we construct a consistent hydrodynamic description for fluids
invariant under translation, rotation and dipole shift symmetry. We use
symmetry principles to propose a novel kind of dipole-conserving thermodynamics
and apply the idea of thermodynamic irreversibility in order to elucidate
dissipative effects. Remarkably, we find that the inclusion of the energy
conservation not only renders the longitudinal modes diffusive rather than
subdiffusive, but diffusion is present even at the lowest order in the
derivative expansion. This work paves the way towards an effective description
of many-body systems with constrained dynamics such as ensembles of topological
defects, fracton phases of matter and certain models of glasses.

<h3>Attractive and repulsive fluctuation-induced pressure in peptide films  deposited on semiconductor substrates</h3>

We consider the fluctuation-induced (Casimir) pressure in peptide films
deposited on GaAs, Ge, and ZnS substrates which are either in dielectric or
metallic state. Calculations of the Casimir pressure are performed in the
framework of fundamental Lifshitz theory employing the frequency-dependent
dielectric permittivities of all involved materials. The electric conductivity
of semiconductor substrates is taken into account within the experimentally and
thermodynamically consistent approach. According to our results, the Casimir
pressure in peptide films deposited on dielectric-type semiconductor substrates
vanishes for some definite film thickness, is repulsive for thinner and
attractive for thicker films. The dependence of this effect on the fraction of
water in the film and on the static dielectric permittivity of semiconductor
substrate is determined. For the metallic-type semiconductor substrates, the
Casimir pressure in peptide coatings is shown to be always repulsive. Possible
applications of these results to the problem of stability of thin coatings in
microdevices are discussed.

<h3>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the attractive kagome-lattice Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07150</a>

<br>
<br>
Recent experimental discovery of several families of kagome-lattice materials
has boosted the interest in electronic correlations on kagome lattice. As an
initial step to understand the observed complex phenomena, it is helpful to
know the correspondence between simple forms of interactions and the induced
correlated states on kagome lattice. Considering the lack of such studies, here
we systematically investigate the attractive kagome-lattice Hubbard model using
the mean-field approach and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). A
charge-density-wave order satisfying the triangle rule is predicted by the
mean-field treatment, and subsequent DQMC simulations provide indirect evidence
for its existence. The $s$-wave superconductivity is found to be stabilized at
low temperatures, and exists in dome regions of the phase diagrams. We then
determine the superconducting critical temperature quantitatively by
finite-size scaling of the pair structure factor. These results may be helpful
in understanding the observed superconductivity in kagome-lattice materials.

The assumption of local relaxation in inhomogeneous quantum quenches allows
to compute asymptotically the expectation value of local observables via
hydrodynamic arguments known as generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). In this work
we address formally the question of when an observable is ``local enough'' to
be described by GHD using the playground of partitioning protocols and
non-interacting time evolution. We show that any state evolving under a
quadratic Hamiltonian can be described via a set of decoupled dynamical fields
such that one of those fields can be identified with a space-time-dependent
generalisation of the root density. By studying the contribution to a connected
spin correlation of each of those fields independently, we derive the locality
conditions under which an observable can be described using the root density
only. That shows both the regime of validity for hydrodynamic approaches that
aim at describing the asymptotic value of observables in term of the root
density only, such as GHD, and the locality conditions necessary for
Gaussianification to occur.

<h3>Kinetics and steady state of polar flock with birth and death</h3>

We study a collection of polar self-propelled particles or polar flock on a
two dimensional substrate with birth and death. Most of the previous studies of
polar flock with birth and death have assumed the compressible flock, such that
the local density of flock is completely ignored. Effect of birth and death of
particles on the flock with moderate density is focus of our study. System is
modeled using coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations of motion for local density
and velocity of the flock and solved using numerical integration of the
nonlinear coupled partial differential equations of motion and linearised
hydrodynamics about the broken symmetry state. We studied the ordering kinetics
as well as the steady state properties of the immortal flock and flock with
finite birth and death rate. The ordering kinetics of the velocity field
remains unaffected whereas the density field shows a crossover from asymptotic
growth exponent $5/6$ for the immortal flock to diffusive limit $1/3$ for large
birth and death rates. In the steady state, the presence of birth and death
rate leads to the suppression of speed of sound wave and density fluctuations
in the system.

<h3>Spin singlet topological superconductivity in the attractive Rashba  Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07251</a>
<br>
<i>Peter Doak, Giovanni Balduzzi, Pontus Laurell, Elbio Dagotto, Thomas A. Maier</i>
<br>
<br>
Fully gapped, spin singlet superconductors with antisymmetric spin-orbit
coupling in a Zeeman magnetic field provide a promising route to realize
superconducting states with non-Abelian topological order and therefore
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we use a quantum Monte Carlo dynamical
cluster approximation to study the superconducting properties of a doped
two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model with Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a
Zeeman magnetic field. We generally find that the Rashba coupling has a
beneficial effect towards s-wave superconductivity. In the presence of a finite
Zeeman field, when superconductivity is suppressed by Pauli pair-breaking, the
Rashba coupling counteracts the spin imbalance created by the Zeeman field by
mixing the spins, and thus restores superconductivity at finite temperatures.
We show that this favorable effect of the spin-orbit coupling is traced to a
spin-flip driven enhancement of the amplitude for the propagation of a pair of
electrons in time-reversed states. Moreover, by inspecting the Fermi surface of
the interacting model, we show that for sufficiently large Rashba coupling and
Zeeman field, the superconducting state is expected to be topologically
non-trivial.

<h3>Exploring the microstructural origins of conductivity and hysteresis in  metal halide perovskites via active learning driven automated scanning probe  microscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07310" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07310</a>
<br>
<i>Yongtao Liu, Jonghee Yang, Rama K. Vasudevan, Kyle P. Kelley, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin, Mahshid Ahmadi</i>
<br>
<br>
Electronic transport and hysteresis in metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are
key to the applications in photovoltaics, light emitting devices, and light and
chemical sensors. These phenomena are strongly affected by the materials
microstructure including grain boundaries, ferroic domain walls, and secondary
phase inclusions. Here, we demonstrate an active machine learning framework for
'driving' an automated scanning probe microscope (SPM) to discover the
microstructures responsible for specific aspects of transport behavior in MHPs.
In our setup, the microscope can discover the microstructural elements that
maximize the onset of conduction, hysteresis, or any other characteristic that
can be derived from a set of current-voltage spectra. This approach opens new
opportunities for exploring the origins of materials functionality in complex
materials by SPM and can be integrated with other characterization techniques
either before (prior knowledge) or after (identification of locations of
interest for detail studies) functional probing.

<h3>Superradiant phononic emission from the analog spin ergoregion in a  two-component Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07337</a>
<br>
<i>Anna Berti, Luca Giacomelli, Iacopo Carusotto</i>
<br>
<br>
We make use of an analog gravity perspective to obtain a physical
understanding of hydrodynamic instabilities stemming from the presence of
quantized vortices in two-component atomic condensates and of their relation to
ergoregion instabilities of rotating massive objects in gravitation. In
addition to the localized instabilities related to vortex splitting,
configurations displaying dynamically unstable modes that extend well outside
the vortex core are found. In this case, the superradiant scattering process
involves phonon emission into the much wider ergoregion of spin modes, so the
physics most closely resembles the one of rotating massive objects. Our results
confirm the potential of two-component condensates as analog models of rotating
space-times in different regimes of gravitational interest.

<h3>Tan's two-body contact in a planar Bose gas: experiment vs theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06857" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06857</a>
<br>
<i>Adam Rançon, Nicolas Dupuis</i>
<br>
<br>
We determine the two-body contact in a planar Bose gas confined by a
transverse harmonic potential, using the nonperturbative functional
renormalization group. We use the three-dimensional thermodynamic definition of
the contact where the latter is related to the derivation of the pressure of
the quasi-two-dimensional system with respect to the three-dimensional
scattering length of the bosons. Without any free parameter, we find a
remarkable agreement with the experimental data of Zou {\it et al.} [Nat. Comm.
{\bf 12}, 760 (2021)] from low to high temperatures, including the vicinity of
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We also show that the
short-distance behavior of the pair distribution function and the high-momentum
behavior of the momentum distribution are determined by two contacts: the
three-dimensional contact for length scales smaller than the characteristic
length $\ell_z=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_z}$ of the harmonic potential and, for
length scales larger than $\ell_z$, an effective two-dimensional contact,
related to the three-dimensional one by a geometric factor depending on
$\ell_z$.

<h3>Diode effects in current-biased Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06866</a>
<br>
<i>Jacob F. Steiner, Larissa Melischek, Martina Trahms, Katharina J. Franke, Felix von Oppen</i>
<br>
<br>
Current-biased Josephson junctions exhibit hysteretic transitions between
dissipative and superconducting states as characterized by switching and
retrapping currents. Here, we develop a theory for diode-like effects in the
switching and retrapping currents of weakly-damped Josephson junctions. We find
that while the diode-like behavior of switching currents is rooted in
asymmetric current-phase relations, nonreciprocal retrapping currents originate
in asymmetric quasiparticle currents. These different origins also imply
distinctly different symmetry requirements. We illustrate our results by a
microscopic model for junctions involving a single magnetic atom. Our theory
provides significant guidance in identifying the microscopic origin of
nonreciprocities in Josephson junctions.

<h3>Anomalous Second Harmonic Generation from Atomically Thin MnBi2Te4</h3>

<br>
<br>
MnBi2Te4 is a van der Waals topological insulator with intrinsic intralayer
ferromagnetic exchange and A-type antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling.
Theoretically, it belongs to a class of structurally centrosymmetric crystals
whose layered antiferromagnetic order breaks inversion symmetry for even layer
numbers, making optical second harmonic generation (SHG) an ideal probe of the
coupling between the crystal and magnetic structures. Here, we perform magnetic
field and temperature-dependent SHG measurements on MnBi2Te4 flakes ranging
from bulk to monolayer thickness. We find that the dominant SHG signal from
MnBi2Te4 is unexpectedly unrelated to both magnetic state and layer number. We
suggest that surface SHG is the likely source of the observed strong SHG, whose
symmetry matches that of the MnBi2Te4-vacuum interface. Our results highlight
the importance of considering the surface contribution to inversion
symmetry-breaking in van der Waals centrosymmetric magnets.

<h3>Comment on "Spin-orbit coupling induced ultrahigh-harmonic generation  from magnetic dynamics'' with prescriptions on how to validate scientific  software for computational quantum transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06895</a>

<i>Branislav K. Nikolic, Jalil Varela Manjarres</i>
<br>
<br>
In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 105, L180415 (2022)], Ly and Manchon used
open source code TKWANT for time-dependent computational quantum transport to
predict surprising features in the mature field of current pumping by
magnetization dynamics in spintronics -- in the presence of spin-orbit (SO)
coupling, the pumped charge current oscillates at both the frequency $\omega_0$
of magnetization precession and high harmonics $N=\omega/\omega_0$, reaching
astonishingly high cutoff $N_\mathrm{max} \simeq 1000$ by increasing the SO
coupling. This prediction could also open new avenues for applications as such
currents would emit electromagnetic radiation ``deep in the terahertz regime''
(op. cit.). However, results in the paper violate two basic theorems of
time-dependent quantum transport: (i) current response to time-periodic
external field must be perfectly periodic itself in the long time limit; and
(ii) no DC component of charge current is allowed in the left-right symmetric
two-terminal devices. We illustrate these two theorems by using completely
different calculations applied to a one-dimensional model of a ferromagnet
hosting the Rashba SO coupling. We conclude that harmonics in pumped current in
the presence of SO coupling do exist, but their ``ultrahigh'' cutoff is an
artifact of either ``bugs'' or inadequate algorithms selected within TKWANT.
Finally, we suggest strategies for validating computational quantum transport
codes, or selection of algorithms by a user within putatively validated (by
developers) code, prior to deploying them to produce research papers.

<h3>Excitonic Spin-Coherence Lifetimes in CdSe Nanoplatelets Increase  Significantly with Core/Shell Morphology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06919" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06919</a>
<br>
<i>Phillip I. Martin, Shobhana Panuganti, Joshua C. Portner, Nicolas E. Watkins, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis, Dmitri V. Talapin, Richard D. Schaller</i>
<br>
<br>
We report spin-polarized transient absorption for colloidal CdSe
nanoplatelets as functions of thickness (2 to 6 monolayer thickness) and
core/shell motif. Using electro-optical modulation of co- and
cross-polarization pump-probe combinations, we sensitively observe
spin-polarized transitions. Core-only nanoplatelets exhibit few-picosecond spin
lifetimes that weakly increase with layer thickness. Spectral content of
differenced spin-polarized signals indicate biexciton binding energies that
decrease with increasing thickness and smaller values than previously reported.
Shell growth of CdS with controlled thicknesses, which partially delocalize the
electron from the hole, significantly increases the spin lifetime to ~49
picoseconds at room temperature. Implementation of ZnS shells, which do not
alter delocalization but do alter surface termination, increased spin lifetimes
up to ~100 ps, bolstering the interpretation that surface termination heavily
influences spin coherence, likely due to passivation of dangling bonds. Spin
precession in magnetic fields both confirms long coherence lifetime at room
temperature and yields excitonic g-factor.

<h3>Nanopowder Diffraction</h3>

As in the available literature there are still misconceptions about powder
diffraction phenomena observed for small nanocrystals ($D<10$ nm), we propose
here a systematic and concise review of the involved issues that can be
approached by atomistic simulations. Most of phenomenological tools of powder
diffraction can be now verified constructing realistic atomistic models,
following their thermodynamics and impact on the diffraction pattern. The
models concern small cuts of the perfect lattice as well as relaxed
nanocrystals also with typical strain and faults, proven by experiments to
approximate the real nanocrystals. The discussed examples concern metal
nanocrystals. We describe the origin of peak shifts that for cuts of the
perfect lattice are mostly due to multiplying of broad profiles by steep slope
factors -- atomic scattering and Lorentz. The Lorentz factor embedded in the
Debye summation is discussed in more detail. For models relaxed with realistic
force fields and for the real nanocrystals the peak shift additionally includes
contribution from surface relaxation which enables development of an
experimental {\it{in situ }} method sensitive to the state of the surface. Such
results are briefly reviewed. For small fcc nanocrystals we discuss the
importance and effect of multiple (111) cross twinning on the peak shift and
height. The strain and size effects for the perfect multitwinned clusters --
decahedra and icosahedra, are explained and visualised. The manuscript proposes
new methods to interpret powder diffraction patterns of real, defected
(twinned) fcc nanoparticles and points to unsuitability of the Rietveld method
in this case.

<h3>Generating extreme quantum scattering in graphene with machine learning</h3>

Graphene quantum dots provide a platform for manipulating electron behaviors
in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials. Most previous works were of the
"forward" type in that the objective was to solve various confinement,
transport and scattering problems with given structures that can be generated
by, e.g., applying an external electrical field. There are applications such as
cloaking or superscattering where the challenging problem of inverse design
needs to be solved: finding a quantum-dot structure according to certain
desired functional characteristics. A brute-force search of the system
configuration based directly on the solutions of the Dirac equation is
computational infeasible. We articulate a machine-learning approach to
addressing the inverse-design problem where artificial neural networks subject
to physical constraints are exploited to replace the rigorous Dirac equation
solver. In particular, we focus on the problem of designing a quantum dot
structure to generate both cloaking and superscattering in terms of the
scattering efficiency as a function of the energy. We construct a physical loss
function that enables accurate prediction of the scattering characteristics. We
demonstrate that, in the regime of Klein tunneling, the scattering efficiency
can be designed to vary over two orders of magnitudes, allowing any scattering
curve to be generated from a proper combination of the gate potentials. Our
physics-based machine-learning approach can be a powerful design tool for 2D
Dirac material-based electronics.

<h3>Tuning the parity of superconductivity in CeRh2As2 via pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06930" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06930</a>
<br>
<i>Hasan Siddiquee, Zackary Rehfuss, Christopher Broyles, Sheng Ran</i>
<br>
<br>
In the recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor CeRh2As2, a magnetic
field induced phase transition has been observed inside the superconducting
state, which is proposed to be a transition from an even to an odd-parity
superconducting state. The odd-parity superconducting state and its large upper
critical field has been explained by local inversion symmetry breaking and
consequent Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here we report the experimental tuning
of the parity of superconductivity in CeRh2As2 via applied pressure.
Superconductivity is enhanced by pressure after its initial suppression,
forming a second dome. However, the odd-parity state only exists in the first
dome and the second dome is dominated by the even-parity state. This parity
switch of superconductivity under pressure is consistent with the competition
between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interlayer hopping in determining the
parity of superconductivity in systems with local inversion symmetry breaking.
Our results provide insightful guidance on how to look for new odd-parity
superconductors.

<h3>Extended transfer matrix method for electron transmission in anisotropic  2D materials: Interplay of strain and (a)periodicity of potentials</h3>

We extend the conventional transfer matrix method to include anisotropic
features for electron transmission in two-dimensional materials, such as
breaking reflection law in pseudo-spin phases and wave vectors. This method
allows to study transmission properties of anisotropic and stratified
electrostatic potential media from a wide range of tunable parameters, which
include strain tensor and gating. We apply the extended matrix method to obtain
the electron transmission, conductance, and Fano factor for the interplay of an
uniaxially strained graphene sheet with external one-dimensional aperiodic
potentials. Our results suggest the possibility of visualizing this interplay
from conductance measurements.

<h3>HATCN on Ag(111): a Molecular Kondo Switch with Intrinsic Magnetic  Bistability</h3>

<br>
<br>
Molecular Kondo switches have become an important avenue for potential
applications in the growing field of molecular spintronics. Here, we report a
novel type of bistable magnetic state of the organic semiconductor HATCN
(C18N12) on Ag(111) which exhibits Kondo switching. Low-temperature scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS) measurements reveal the
existence of two types of adsorbed HATCN molecules with distinctly different
appearances and magnetic states, as evident from the presence or absence of an
Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo (ASK) resonance. Our DFT results show that HATCN on
Ag(111) supports two almost isoenergetic states, both with one excess electron
transferred from the Ag surface, but with magnetic moments of either 0 or 0.65
Bohr magneton. Therefore, even though all molecules undergo charge transfer of
1 electron from the Ag substrate, they exist in two different molecular
magnetic states that resemble a free doublet or an entangled spin state. We
show that molecules can be switched to the Kondo state. This study provides
deeper insight into the physics of the Kondo effect in molecules on surfaces
and explores a molecular Kondo switch potentially suited for practical
spintronics.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Electrochemical Phase Maps: Beyond Butler-Volmer Kinetics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06952</a>

<br>
<br>
Electrochemical kinetics at electrode-electrolyte interfaces are crucial to
understand high-rate behavior of energy storage devices. Phase transformation
of electrodes is typically treated under equilibrium thermodynamic conditions,
while realistic operation is at finite rates. Analyzing phase transformations
under nonequilibrium conditions requires integrating nonlinear electrochemical
kinetic models with thermodynamic models. This had only previously been
demonstrated for Butler-Volmer kinetics, where it can be done analytically. In
this work, we develop a kinetic modeling package in the Julia language capable
of efficient numerical inversion of rate relationships for general kinetic
models using automatic differentiation. We demonstrate building nonequilibrium
phase maps, including for models such as Marcus-Hush-Chidsey that require
computation of an integral, and also discuss the impact of a variety of
assumptions and model parameters (such as temperature, reorganization energy,
activity, and ideal solution interaction energy), particularly on high-rate
phase behavior. Even for a fixed set of parameters, the magnitude of the
critical current can vary by in excess of a factor of two amongst kinetic
models.

We introduce a novel two-dimensional electronic system with ultrastrong
interlayer interactions, namely twisted bilayer graphene with a large twist
angle, as an ideal ground for realizing interlayer-coherent excitonic
condensates. In these systems, subnanometer atomic separation between the
layers allows significant interlayer interactions, while interlayer electron
tunneling is geometrically suppressed due to the large twist angle. By fully
exploiting these two features we demonstrate that a sequence of odd-integer
quantum Hall states with interlayer coherence appears at the second Landau
level (N = 1). Notably the energy gaps for these states are of order 1 K, which
is several orders of magnitude greater than those in GaAs. Furthermore, a
variety of quantum Hall phase transitions are observed experimentally. All the
experimental observations are largely consistent with our phenomenological
model calculations. Hence, we establish that a large twist angle system is an
excellent platform for high-temperature excitonic condensation.

Magnetic skyrmions with a well-defined spin texture have shown unprecedented
potential for various spintronic applications owning to their topologically
non-trivial and quasiparticle properties. To put skyrmions into practical
technology, efficient manipulation, especially the inhibition of skyrmion Hall
effect (SkHE) has been intensively pursued. In spite of the recent progress
made on reducing SkHE in several substituted systems, such as ferrimagnets and
synthetic antiferromagnets, the organized creation and current driven motion of
skyrmions with negligible SkHE in ferromagnets remain challenging. Here, by
embeding the [Co/Pd] multilayer into a surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line,
we experimentally realized the ordered generation of magnetic skyrmions. The
resultant current-induced skyrmions movement with negligible SkHE was observed,
which can be attributed to the energy redistribution of the system during the
excitation of SAW. Our findings open up an unprecedentedly new perspective for
manipulating topological solitons, and would advance the development of
skyrmionics and spin acousto-electronics.

<br>
<br>
The accumulation of strain plays a key role in defining the electronic
structure of two-dimensional materials. In moir\'e superlattices, including
those of transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDs), strain may arise intrinsically
due to spontaneous intralayer lattice relaxation, as well as from the extrinsic
stretching of one or both layers. Imaging of TMD moir\'es has so far
established a qualitative understanding of lattice relaxation in terms of
interlayer stacking energies, and quantification of strain has relied
exclusively on theoretical simulations. Here, we develop interferometric
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy to quantitatively
map strain fields in small-angle twisted bilayer MoS2 and WSe2/MoS2
heterobilayers with sub-nanometer resolution. These strain maps quantify how
local rotations govern the intrinsic reconstruction process for twisted
homobilayers, and reveal that local in-plane dilations dominate in
heterobilayers possessing a sufficiently large lattice constant mismatch.
Extrinsic uniaxial heterostrain, which introduces a lattice constant difference
in twisted homobilayers, leads to further accumulation and redistribution of
reconstruction strain, demonstrating another route to modify the moir\'e
potential landscape.

We introduce a classical analog of quantum matter in ultracold molecule- or
Rydberg atom- synthetic dimensions, extending the Potts model to include
interactions J1 between atoms adjacent in both real and synthetic space and
studying its finite temperature properties. For intermediate values of J1, the
resulting phases and phase diagrams are similar to those of the clock and
Villain models, in which three phases emerge. There exists a sheet phase
analogous to that found in quantum synthetic dimension models between the high
temperature disordered phase and the low temperature ferromagnetic phase. We
also employ machine learning to uncover non-trivial features of the phase
diagram using the learning by confusion approach.

<br>
<i>Aritra Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
In this brief note, we demonstrate a generalized energy equipartition theorem
for a generic electrical circuit with Johnson-Nyquist (thermal) noise. From
quantum mechanical considerations, the thermal modes have an energy
distribution dictated by Planck's law. For a resistive circuit with some
inductance, it is shown that the real part of the admittance is proportional to
a probability distribution function which modulates the contributions to the
system's mean energy from various frequencies of the Fourier spectrum. Further,
we analyze the case with a capacitor connected in series with an inductor and a
resistor. The results resemble superstatistics, i.e. a superposition of two
statistics and can be reformulated in the energy representation. The correct
classical limit is obtained as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$.

<br>
<br>
The transport of optically excited, hot electrons in heterostructures is
analyzed by femtosecond, time-resolved two-photon photoelectron emission
spectroscopy (2PPE) for epitaxial Au/Fe/MgO(001). We compare the temporal
evolution of the 2PPE intensity upon optically pumping Fe or Au, while the
probing occurs on the Au surface. In the case of Fe-side pumping, assuming
independent relaxation in the Fe and Au layers, we determine the hot electron
relaxation times in these individual layers by an analysis of the Au layer
thickness dependence of the observed, effective electron lifetimes in the
heterostructure. We show in addition that such a systematic analysis fails for
the case of Au-side pumping due to the spatially distributed optical excitation
density, which varies with the Au layer thickness. This work extends a previous
study [Beyazit et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 076803 (2020)] by new data leading
to reduced error bars in the determined lifetimes and by a non-linear term in
the Au-thickness dependent data analysis which contributes for similar Fe and
Au film thicknesses.

We study the properties of moving uniform dipolar Bose-Bose mixtures using
the full Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. The analytical and numerical
calculations emphasize that the competition between the relative motion of two
fluids and the interspecies dipole-dipole interactions may affect the behavior
of the condensed depletion, the anomalous density, the ground-state energy and
second-order pair correlation. It is found that in the lower branch of the
mixture, these quantities are unimportant and present an unconventional
behavior.

Valleytronics using two-dimensional materials opens unprecedented
opportunities for information processing with the valley polarizer being a
basic building block. Paradigms such as strain engineering, the inclusion of
line defects, and the application of electrostatic-magnetic fields extensively
explored for creating valley polarization suffer from limitations like smaller
transmission or the lack of polarization directionality. We propose an
all-electrical valley polarizer using zigzag edge graphene nanoribbons in a
multi-terminal device geometry, that can be gate-tuned to operate along two
independent regimes: (i) terminal-specific valley filter that utilizes
bandstructure engineering, and (ii) parity-specific valley filter that exploits
the parity selection rule in zigzag edge graphene. We show that the device
exhibits intriguing physics in the multimode regime of operation that affects
the valley polarization and hence investigate various factors affecting the
polarization in wide device geometries, such as, optical analogs of graphene
Dirac fermions, angle-selective transmission via p-n junctions, and the
localization of edge states. We optimize the geometry of the proposed device to
achieve maximum valley polarization, thereby, paving the way toward a physics
based tunable valleytronic device design using monolayer graphene.

Solid state spins have demonstrated significant potential in quantum sensing
with applications including fundamental science, medical diagnostics and
navigation. The quantum sensing schemes showing best performance under ambient
conditions all utilize microwave or radio-frequency driving, which poses a
significant limitation for miniaturization, energy-efficiency and
non-invasiveness of quantum sensors. We overcome this limitation by
demonstrating a purely optical approach to coherent quantum sensing. Our scheme
involves the $^{15}$N nuclear spin of the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in
diamond as a sensing resource, and exploits NV spin dynamics in oblique
magnetic fields near the NV's excited state level anti-crossing to optically
pump the nuclear spin into a quantum superposition state. We demonstrate
all-optical free-induction decay measurements - the key protocol for
low-frequency quantum sensing - both on single spins and spin ensembles. Our
results pave the way for highly compact quantum sensors to be employed for
magnetometry or gyroscopy applications in challenging environments.

<h3>Measurement of the temperature decrease in evaporating soap films</h3>

<i>François Boulogne, Frédéric Restagno, Emmanuelle Rio</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent advances have demonstrated that evaporation can play a significant
role on soap film stability, which is a key concern in many industrial areas
but also for children playing with bubbles. Thus, evaporation leads to a film
thinning but also to a film cooling, which has been overlooked for soapy
objects. Here, we study the temperature variation of an evaporating soap film
for different values of relative humidity and glycerol concentrations. We
evidence that the temperature of soap films can decrease after their creation
up to 8$~^\text{o}$C. We propose a model describing the temperature drop of
soap films after their formation that is in quantitative agreement with our
experiments. We emphasize that this cooling effect is significant and must be
carefully considered in future studies on the dynamics of soap films.

<h3>Slow dynamics of a mobile impurity interacting with an Anderson  insulator</h3>

<i>Piotr Sierant, Titas Chanda, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate dynamics of a single mobile impurity immersed in a bath of
Anderson localized particles and focus on the regime of relatively strong
disorder and interactions. In that regime, the dynamics of the system is
particularly slow, suggesting, at short times, an occurrence of many-body
localization. Considering longer time scales, we show that the latter is a
transient effect and that, eventually, the impurity spreads sub-diffusively and
induces a gradual delocalization of the Anderson insulator. The phenomenology
of the system in the considered regime of slow dynamics includes a
sub-diffusive growth of mean square displacement of the impurity, power-law
decay of density correlation functions of the Anderson insulator and a
power-law growth of entanglement entropy in the system. We observe a similar
regime of slow dynamics also when the disorder in the system is replaced by a
sufficiently strong quasi-periodic potential.

<br>
<br>
We present a new variational method to study the dynamics of a closed bosonic
many-body system, the time-dependent hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method,
tHNC . Based on the Jastrow ansatz, it accounts for quantum fluctuations in a
non-perturbative way. tHNC scales well with the number of dimensions, as
demonstrated by our results on one, two, and three dimensions. We apply the
tHNC method to interaction quenches, i.e. sudden changes of the interaction
strength, in homogeneous Bose gases. When the quench is strong enough that the
final state has roton excitations (as found and predicted for dipolar and
Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates, respectively), the pair distribution
function exhibits stable oscillations. For validation, we compare tHNC results
with time-dependent variational Monte Carlo results in one and two dimensions.

<h3>Distributed vorticity model for vortex molecule dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Sarthak Choudhury, Joachim Brand</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the effect of a hard wall trapping potential on the dynamics of a
vortex molecule in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with linear
coherent coupling. A vortex molecule consists of a vortex of the same charge in
each component condensate connected by a domain wall of the relative phase. In
a previous paper Ref.[Phys. RevA. 106,043319(2022)] we described the
interaction of a vortex molecule with the boundary using the method of images
by separately treating each component vortex as a point vortex, in addition to
a Magnus force effect from the surface tension of the domain wall. Here we
extend the model by considering a continuous distribution of image vorticity
reflecting the effect of the domain wall on the vortex molecule phase
structure. In the case of a precessing centered vortex molecule in an isotropic
trap, distributing the image vorticity weakens its contribution to the
precession frequency. We test the model predictions against numerical
simulations of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations in a two-dimensional
circular disc and find support for the improved model.

<br>
Recent quasi-2D systems with judicious exploitation of the atomic monolayer
or few-layer architecture exhibit unprecedented physical properties that
challenge the conventional wisdom on the condensed matter physics. Here we show
that the infinite layer SrCuO2 (SCO), a topical cuprate Mott insulator in the
bulk form, can manifest an unexpected metallic state in the quasi-2D limit when
SCO is grown on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 (STO) substrates. Hard x-ray core-level
photoemission spectra demonstrate a definitive Fermi level that resembles the
hole doped metal. Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy also reveals features
analogous to those of a hole doped Mott insulator. Based on these results, we
conclude that the hole doping does not occur at the interfaces between SCO and
STO; instead, it comes from the transient layers between the chain type and the
planar type structures within the SCO slab. The present work reveals a novel
metallic state in the infinite layer SCO and invites further examination to
elucidate the spatial extent of this state.

<h3>Anomalous Vapor and Ice Nucleation in Water at Negative Pressures: A  Classical Density Functional Theory Study</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuvraj Singh, Mantu Santra, Rakesh S. Singh</i>
<br>
<br>
In contrast to the abundance of work on the anomalous behavior of water, the
relationship between the water's thermodynamic anomalies and kinetics of phase
transition from metastable water is relatively unexplored. In this work, we
have employed classical density functional theory to provide a unified and
coherent picture of nucleation (both vapor and ice) from metastable water,
especially at negative pressure conditions. Our results suggest a peculiar
non-monotonic temperature dependence of liquid-vapor surface tension at
temperatures where liquid-vapor coexistence is metastable with respect to the
ice phase. The vapor nucleation barrier on isochoric cooling also shows a
non-monotonic temperature dependence. We further note that, for lower density
isochores, the temperature of minimum vapor nucleation barrier ($T_{\Delta
\Omega_{\rm v/min}^*}$) does not coincide with the temperature of maximum
density (TMD) where metastability is maximum. The temperature difference
between the $T_{\Delta \Omega_{\rm v/min}^*}$ and the TMD, however, decreases
with increasing the density of the isochore, suggesting a strong correlation
between the propensity of cavitation and metastability of the liquid water at
high densities. The vapor nucleation barrier along isobaric cooling shows an
interesting crossover behavior where it first increases on lowering the
temperature and then shows a non-monotonic behavior in the vicinity of the
Widom line on further lowering the temperature. Our results on the ice
nucleation from metastable water show an anomalous retracing behavior of the
ice nucleation barrier along isotherms and theoretically validate the recent
findings that the reentrant ice(Ih)-liquid coexistence can induce a drastic
change in the kinetics of ice nucleation. In addition, this study also provides
deeper insights into the origin of the isothermal compressibility maximum on
isochoric cooling.

<br>
<br>
We propose SnBi2Te4 to be a novel candidate material exhibiting temperature
(T) mediated transitions between rich topological phases. From a combined
theoretical and experimental studies, we find that SnBi2Te4 goes from a low-T
topological semimetallic phase to a high-T (room temperature) topological
insulating phase via an intermediate topological metallic phase. Single
crystals of SnBi2Te4 are characterized by various experimental probes including
Synchrotron based X-ray diffraction, magnetoresistance, Hall effect, Seebeck
coefficient, magnetization and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). X-ray diffraction data confirms an anomalous thermal expansion of the
unit cell volume below 100 K, which significantly affects the bulk band
structure and hence the transport properties, as confirmed by our density
functional theory calculations. Simulated surface states at 15 K agree fairly
well with our ARPES data and are found to be robust with varying T. This
indirectly supports the experimentally observed paramagnetic singularity in the
entire T-range. The proposed coexistence of rich topological phases is a rare
occurrence, yet paves a fertile ground to tune various topological phases in a
material driven by structural distortion.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, a non-Markovian Gross-Pitaevskii equation is proposed to
describe the formation of a condensate in an exciton-polariton system under
incoherent pumping. By introducing spatially delta-correlated noise terms, we
observe a transition from a spatially ordered phase to a disordered one as the
temperature increases. In course of this process, the population of the
condensate is significantly reduced. Irregularly located separate dense spots
of condensate above the transition temperature are revealed. Using the Gabor
transform, it is shown that, with increasing temperature, the condensate
decoheres, that is accompanied by the transition from narrowband to broadband
spectral density.

Protein-ligand (un)binding simulations are a recent focus of biased molecular

how to compute kinetics along separate paths and to combine the path-specific
rates into global binding and unbinding rates for comparison with experiment.
Using dissipation-corrected targeted molecular dynamics in combination with
temperature-boosted Langevin equation simulations [Nat. Commun. \textbf{11},

aspects of its practical applicability to predict multisecond kinetics of

Using helium-3 atom scattering, we have studied the adsorption kinetics, the

exhibit activation barriers of $E_a=(89\pm7)\,$meV and $E_d=(1.8\pm0.2)\,$eV,

<br>
The field-free spin-orbit torque induced 180{\deg} reorientation of
perpendicular magnetization is beneficial for the high performance magnetic
memory. The antiferromagnetic material (AFM) can provide higher operation speed
than the ferromagnetic counterpart. In this paper, we propose a trilayer
AFM/Insulator/Heavy Metal structure as the AFM memory device. We show that the
field-free switching of the AFM with perpendicular N\'eel vector can be
achieved by using two orthogonal currents, which provide the uniform
damping-like torque and stagger field-like torque, respectively. The reversible
switching can be obtained by reversing either current. A current density of
1.79 10^11A/m^2 is sufficient to induce the switching. In addition, the two
magnetic moments become noncollinear during the switching. This enables an
ultrafast switching within 40 picoseconds. The device and switching mechanism
proposed in this work offer a promising approach to deterministically switch
the AFM with perpendicular N\'eel vector. It can also stimulate the development
of ultrafast AFM-based MRAM.

<br>
<br>
The RE$_{5}$Pt$_2$In$_4$ (RE = Gd-Tm) rare earth compounds have been
investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as by DC and AC
magnetometric measurements. The compounds crystallize in an orthorhombic
crystal structure of the Lu$_{5}$Ni$_2$In$_4$-type (\textit{Pbam} space group,
No.~55). With decreasing temperature the intermetallics undergo a transition
from para- to ferro-/ferri- (RE~=~Gd, Tb, Ho, Er) or antiferromagnetic state
(RE~=~Tm). In case of Dy$_{5}$Pt$_2$In$_4$, the ferromagnetic state is reached
through an intermediate antiferromagnetic order present in a limited
temperature range. The critical temperatures of magnetic ordering range from
4.1~K (RE~=~Tm) up to 108~K (RE~=~Tb). For the majority of investigated
compounds, a cascade of additional magnetic transitions is found below the
respective critical temperatures of magnetic ordering. The magnetic moments are
found solely on the rare earth atoms, while the moments of the remaining Pt and
In atoms are absent or are too small to be detected while accompanied by the
strong rare earth's moments. The magnetocaloric (MCE) performance of
RE$_{5}$T$_2$In$_4$ (RE~=~Gd-Tm) is found quite good, especially while taking
into account the compounds with RE = Ho and Er. Maximum magnetic entropy change
($-\Delta S_M^{max}$) reaches 11.8 (RE~=~Ho) or
11.4~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ (RE~=~Er) under magnetic flux density
change of 0-9~T. Under the same conditions, the relative cooling power (RCP)
and refrigerant capacity (RC) equal 607 and 495~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$ (RE~=~Ho) or
434 and 341~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$ (RE~=~Er).

<h3>Impurity Knight shift in quantum dot Josephson junctions</h3>

<i>Luka Pavešić, Marta Pita-Vidal, Arno Bargerbos, Rok Žitko</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the Zeeman splitting of spinful subgap states in a Josephson
junction with an embedded quantum dot. The magnitude of the splitting is
renormalized by the exchange interaction between the local moment and the
continuum of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in a variant of the Knight shift
phenomenon. We show that the leading term in the shift is linear in the
hybridisation strength (quadratic in electron hopping), while the subleading
term is quadratic in the hybridisation strength (quartic in electron hopping)
and depends on the gauge-invariant phase difference across the junction due to
spin-polarization-dependent corrections to the Josephson energy of the device.
We quantify the phase-dependent part of the Zeeman splitting for experimentally
relevant parameters beyond the perturbative regime using numerical
renormalization group calculations. We present measurements on a Josephson
junction device which show the presence of a phase-dependent contribution to
Zeeman splitting that is consistent with the impurity Knight shift. This
magnetic-field-tunable coupling between the quantum dot spin and the Josephson
current could find wide use in superconducting spintronics.

negative differential resistance region in the current-voltage characteristics
of the various Nu-SLTJs, we predict the Nu-SLTJs offer the fastest spin
transfer torque switching in the order of a few hundred picoseconds. We
self-consistently employ the atomistic non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism coupled with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation to
evaluate the device performance of the various Nu-SLTJs. We also present the
design of minimal three-barrier Nu-SLTJs having significant TMR($\approx

the class of Nu-SLTJs proposed in this work may lay the bedrock to embark on
the exhilarating voyage of exploring various non-uniform superlattices for the

Recent experimental observations of current blockades in 2-D material
quantum-dot platforms have opened new avenues for spin and valley-qubit
processing. Motivated by experimental results, we construct a model capturing
the delicate interplay of Coulomb interactions, inter-dot tunneling, Zeeman
splittings, and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in a double quantum dot structure
to simulate the Pauli blockades. Analyzing the relevant Fock-subspaces of the
generalized Hamiltonian, coupled with the density matrix master equation
technique for transport across the setup, we identify the generic class of
blockade mechanisms. Most importantly, and contrary to what is widely
recognized, we show that conducting and blocking states responsible for the
Pauli-blockades are a result of the coupled effect of all degrees of freedom
and cannot be explained using the spin or the valley pseudo-spin only. We then
numerically predict the regimes where Pauli blockades might occur, and, to this
end, we verify our model against actual experimental data and propose that our
model can be used to generate data sets for different values of parameters with
the ultimate goal of training on a machine learning algorithm. Our work
provides an enabling platform for a predictable theory-aided experimental
realization of single-shot readout of the spin and valley states on DQDs based
on 2D-material platforms.

We report on magneto-optical studies of the quasi-two-dimensional van der
Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_3$. Our measurements reveal an excitation that
closely resembles the antiferromagnetic resonance mode typical of easy-axis
antiferromagnets, nevertheless, it displays an unusual, four-times larger
Zeeman splitting in an applied magnetic field. We identify this excitation with
an $|S_z|=4$ multipolar magnon -- a single-ion 4-magnon bound state -- that
corresponds to a full reversal of a single magnetic moment of the Fe$^{2+}$
ion. We argue that condensation of multipolar magnons in large-spin materials
with a strong magnetic anisotropy can produce new exotic states.

We study electronic quantum transport in graphene nanoribbon (GNR) networks
on mesoscopic length scales. We focus on zigzag GNRs and investigate the
conductance properties of statistical networks. To this end we use a
density-functional-based tight-binding model to determine the electronic
structure and quantum transport theory to calculate electronic transport
properties. We then introduce a new efficient network decimation algorithm that
reduces the complexity in generic three-diemnsional GNR networks. We compare
our results to semi-classical calculations based on the nodal analysis approach
and discuss the dependence of the conductance on network density and network
size. We show that a nodal analysis model cannot reproduce the quantum
transport results nor their dependence on model parameters well. Thus, solving
the quantum network by our efficient approach is mandatory for accurate
modelling the electron transport through GNR networks.

Higher-order topology in non-Hermitian (NH) systems has recently become one
of the most promising and rapidly developing fields in condensed matter
physics. Many distinct phases that were not present in the Hermitian
equivalents are shown in these systems. In this work, we examine how
higher-order Weyl semimetals are impacted by NH perturbation. We identify a new
type of topological semimetal, i.e., non-Hermitian higher-order Weyl semimetal
(NHHOWS) with surface diabolic points. We demonstrate that in such an NHHOWS,
new exceptional points inside the bulk can be created and annihilated,
therefore allowing us to manipulate their number. At the boundary, these
exceptional points are connected through unique surface states with diabolic
points and hinge states. For specific system parameters, the surface of NHHOWS
behaves as a Dirac phase with linear dispersion or a Luttinger phase with a
quadratic dispersion, thus paving a way for Dirac-Luttinger switching. Finally,
we employ the biorthogonal technique to reinstate the standard bulk boundary
correspondence for NH systems and compute the topological invariants. The
obtained quantized biorthogonal Chern number and quadruple moment topologically
protect the unique surface and hinge states, respectively.

<h3>Stochastic thermodynamics of opinion dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that models of opinion formation and dissemination in a community of
individuals can be framed within stochastic thermodynamics from which we can
build a nonequilibrium thermodynamics of opinion dynamics. This is accomplished
by decomposing the original transition rate that defines an opinion model into
two or more transition rates, each representing the contact with heat
reservoirs at different temperatures, and postulating an energy function. As
the temperatures are distinct, heat fluxes are present even at the stationary
state and linked to the production of entropy, the fundamental quantity that
characterizes nonequilibrium states. We apply the present framework to a
generic-vote model including the majority-vote model in a square lattice and in
a cubic lattice. The fluxes and the rate of entropy production are calculated
by numerical simulation and by the use of a pair approximation.

<h3>Anomalous spatial shifts in interface electronic reflection beyond  linear approximation</h3>

Recently, the electronic analogy of the anomalous spatial shift, including
Goos-H\"{a}nchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects, has been attracting widespread
interest. The current research on the anomalous spatial shift in interface
electronic reflection is based on the paradigm of linear approximation, under
which the center position of the incident and reflected beams are obtained by
expanding the phases of relevant basis states and scattering amplitudes to the
first order of incident momentum. However, in a class of normal cases, the
linear approximation can lead to a divergent spatial shift in reflection for
certain incident angles even though the corresponding reflection possibility is
finite. In this work, we show that such non-physical results are caused by an
abrupt change in the number of the propagating states at critical parameters,
and can be resolved by calculating the center positions of the scattering beams
beyond the linear approximation. Moreover, we find that the beam width has an
important influence on the spatial shift near the critical angles. We
demonstrate our idea via concrete calculations of Goos-H\"{a}nchen and
Imbert-Fedorov shift on two representative models. These results are beneficial
for clarifying the scope of application of the linear approximation in the
study of anomalous spatial shifts.

<h3>Effective interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and skyrmion  stabilization in ferromagnet/paramagnet and ferromagnet/superconductor hybrid  systems</h3>

<i>M.A. Kuznetsov, K.R. Mukhamatchin, A.A. Fraerman</i>
<br>
<br>
It is shown that a term in the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI) contributes to the free energy of a ferromagnetic (FM) film on a
paramagnetic (PM) (an FM above the critical temperature, T_c) or
superconducting (SC) substrate occurring in the London limit. This contribution
results from magnetostatic interaction between the film and substrate under
which the substrate affects FM magnetization back via its magnetic field
produced by magnetization inhomogeneity in the film. Strikingly, in the FM/PM
system this effective DMI stabilizes chiral magnetic textures, e.g., magnetic
skyrmions (MSk's), which is in contrast to that in the FM/SC one. A strong
temperature sensitivity of the effective DMI near T_c allows for tuning the
coupling between the FM film and PM or SC substrate and thus controlling the
MSk radius in FM/PM.

Pieces of $n$-type silicon with 3.5 k$\Omega \cdot $cm resistivity have been
irradiated by reactor neutrons to fluences of (1, 5 and 10) $\times 10^{16}$
cm$^{-2}$. Using light-transmission measurements, the absorption coefficients
have been determined for photon energies, $E_\gamma $, between 0.62 and 1.30 eV
for the samples as irradiated and after 15 min isochronal annealing with
temperatures between 80{\deg}C and 330{\deg}C. The radiation-induced absorption
coefficient, $\alpha_\mathit{irr}$, has been obtained by subtracting the
absorption coefficient for non-irradiated silicon. The $E_\gamma $-dependence
of $\alpha_\mathit{irr}$ shows a resonance peak, which is ascribed to the
neutral divacancy, V$_2^0$, sitting on a background, and $\alpha_\mathit{irr}
(E_\gamma )$ is fitted by a Breit-Wigner line shape on a parameterized
background. It is found that at an annealing temperature of 210{\deg}C the
V$_2^0$ intensity is reduced by a factor 2, and that at the meV level, the
position and the width of the fitted Breit-Wigner do not change with
irradiation dose and annealing.

<h3>Evidence for gapless quantum spin liquid in a honeycomb lattice</h3>

One main theme in current condensed matter physics is the search of quantum
spin liquid (QSL), an exotic magnetic state with strongly-fluctuating and
highly-entangled spins down to zero temperature. However, there is no consensus
on the existence of QSL ground state in any real material so far. The disorders
and competing exchange interactions may prevent the formation of an ideal QSL
state on frustrated spin lattices. Here we report systematic heat transport
measurements on a honeycomb-lattice compound BaCo2(AsO4)2, which manifests
magnetic order in zero field. In a narrow field range after the magnetic order
is nearly suppressed by an in-plane field, in both perpendicular and parallel
to the zigzag direction, a finite residual linear term of thermal conductivity
is clearly observed, which is attributed to the mobile fractionalized spinon
excitations. This provides smoking-gun evidence for a gapless QSL state in
BaCo2(AsO4)2. We discuss the underlying physics to form this exotic gapless QSL
state in Co2+ honeycomb lattice.

Experiments have shown that pitting corrosion can develop in aluminum
surfaces at potentials $> -0.5$ V relative to the standard hydrogen electrode
(SHE). Until recently, the onset of pitting corrosion in aluminum has not been
rigorously explored at an atomistic scale because of the difficulty of
incorporating a voltage into density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We
introduce the Quantum Continuum Approximation (QCA) which self-consistently
couples explicit DFT calculations of the metal-insulator and insulator-solution
interfaces to continuum Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic distributions
describing the bulk of the insulating region. By decreasing the number of atoms
necessary to explicitly simulate with DFT by an order of magnitude, QCA makes
the first-principles prediction of the voltage of realistic electrochemical
interfaces feasible. After developing this technique, we apply QCA to predict
the formation energy of chloride atoms inserting into oxygen vacancies in
Al(111)/$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) interfaces as a function of applied
voltage. We predict that chloride insertion is only favorable in systems with a
grain boundary in the Al$_2$O$_3$ for voltages $> -0.2$ V (SHE). Our results
roughly agree with the experimentally demonstrated onset of corrosion,
demonstrating QCA's utility in modeling realistic electrochemical systems at
reasonable computational cost.

Manipulating oxygen vacancies in strongly correlated rare-earth nickelate
perovskites (RNiO$_3$) enables the tuning of their elusive metal-insulator
transition (MIT), providing a better handle for control over their electronic
properties. In this paper, we investigate the effect of various oxygen vacancy
configurations on the MIT of LaNiO$_3$ by studying their spectral functions and
the corresponding diffusion energy path using dynamical mean field theory
(DMFT) and density functional theory plus U (DFT+U). To consider all possible
configurations for a fixed vacancy concentration, we use a symmetry-adapted
configurational ensemble method. Within this method, we can reduce the
configurational space which needs to be considered, thus lowering the
computational cost. We demonstrate that controlling the oxygen vacancy position
can tune the occurrence of MIT. We also show that the nudged elastic band (NEB)
energy barrier heights and energy profile obtained using DMFT are lower and
different than those obtained using DFT+U due to dynamical quantum fluctuations
among non-degenerate correlated orbitals not properly treated in DFT+U.

We consider the stability of precipitates formed at grain boundaries (GBs) by
radiation-induced segregation in dilute alloys subjected to irradiation. The
effects of grain size and misorientation of symmetric-tilt GBs are quantified
using phase field modeling. A novel regime is identified where, at long times,
GBs are decorated by precipitate patterns that resist coarsening. Maps of the
diffusional P\'eclet number indicate that arrested coarsening takes place when
solute advection dominates over thermal diffusion up to the precipitate/matrix
interface, overwhelming capillary effects. This contrasts with liquid-solid
mixtures where convection only accelerates coarsening.

Strontium titanate is an incipient ferroelectric in which superconductivity
emerges at exceptionally low doping levels. Remarkably, stabilizing the polar
phase through strain or chemical substitution has been shown to significantly
enhance the superconducting critical temperature, and the polar instability
plays a pivotal role in the majority of proposed superconducting pairing
mechanisms. A rigorous understanding of ferroelectricity is therefore essential
to elucidate the electron pairing mechanism in this material. To investigate
the nature of the polar order in strontium titanate, we develop a simplified
free energy model that only includes the degrees of freedom necessary to
capture the relevant physics in a biaxially compressively strained system. Our
model is able to calculate the energies of large, disordered systems with near
DFT-level accuracy. We simulate the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive phase
transitions using the Monte Carlo method and discuss the coupling between
various order parameters. Finally, we assess the character of the polar
transition, which we find to be neither strictly displacive nor order-disorder.

One-dimensional (1D) organic metal halide hybrids exhibit strongly
anisotropic optical properties, highly efficient light emission, and large
Stokes shift, holding promises for novel photodetection and lighting
applications. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their unique
optical properties and in particular the impacts of surface effects are not
understood. Here, we investigate 1D C4N2H14PbBr4 by polarization-dependent
time-averaged and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, as a
function of photoexcitation energy. Surprisingly, we find that the emission
under photoexcitation polarized parallel to the 1D metal halide chains can be
either stronger or weaker than that under perpendicular polarization, depending
on the excitation energy. We attribute the excitation-energy-dependent
anisotropic emission to fast surface recombination, supported by
first-principles calculations of optical absorption in this material. The fast
surface recombination is directly confirmed by TRPL measurements, when the
excitation is polarized parallel to the chains. Our comprehensive studies
provide a more complete picture for a deeper understanding of the optical
anisotropy in 1D organic metal halide hybrids.

Charge traps in the semiconductor bulk (bulk charge traps) make it difficult
to predict the electric field within wide-bandgap semiconductors. The issue is
the daunting number of bulk charge-trap candidates, which means the treatment
of bulk charge traps is generally qualitative or uses generalized models that
do not consider the trap's particular electronic structure. The electric field
within a wide-bandgap semiconductor is nonetheless a crucial quantity in
determining the operation of semiconductor devices and the performance of
solid-state single-photon emitters embedded within the semiconductor devices.
In this work, we accurately compute the average electric field measured at the
location of N$V^-$ charged defects at the $^{15}$N$^+$ average implantation
depth of $\left<d\right> = 35$ nm for the commonly used oxygen-terminated
diamond (see [D. A. Broadway $et al$., Nature Electronics 1, 502 (2018)]). We
achieve this result by evaluating the leading-order contribution to the
electric field far away from the surface, which comes from the substitutional N
defects that induce the ionization of the N$V^-$. Our results use
density-functional theory (DFT) and the principle of band bending. Our work has
the potential to aid both in the prediction of the functioning of semiconductor
devices and in the prediction and correction of the spectral diffusion that
often plagues the optical frequencies of solid-state single-photon emitters
upon repeated photoexcitation measurements.

In time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetals, Weyl points act as
monopoles and antimonopoles of the Berry curvature, with a
monopole-antimonopole pair producing a net zero Berry flux. The two-dimensional
(2D) planes that separate a monopole-antimonopole pair of Weyl points carry
quantized Berry flux. In this work, we introduce a class of symmetry-protected
Weyl semimetals which host monopole-antimonopole pairs of Weyl points that
generate a quantized dipolar Berry flux. Consequently, topologically distinct
2D planes coexist in the Brillouin zone, carrying either quantized monopolar or
dipolar flux. We construct a topological invariant -- the staggered Chern
number -- to measure the quantized dipolar flux and employ it to topologically
distinguish between various Weyl points. Finally, through a minimal two-band
model, we investigate physical signatures of bulk topology, including surface
Fermi arcs, zero-energy hinge states, and response to insertion of a $\pi$-flux
vortex.

Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme
of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions
between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon
bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we show that such induced
attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a
two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the
boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where
the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting
critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two
experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in
two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.
