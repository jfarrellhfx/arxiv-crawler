<h3>Elastic and transport coefficients of the perfect hard-sphere crystal  from the poles of the hydrodynamic spectral functions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11697</a>
<br>
<i>Joel Mabillard, Pierre Gaspard</i>
<p>The elastic and transport coefficients of a perfect face-centered cubic
crystal of hard spheres are computed from the poles of the dynamic structure
factor and of the spectral functions of transverse momentum density
fluctuations. For such crystals, the relevant coefficients are the three
isothermal elastic constants $(C_{11}^T,C_{12}^T,C_{44}^T)$, the heat
conductivity $\kappa$, and the three viscosities
$(\eta_{11},\eta_{12},\eta_{44})$ (in Voigt's notations), which are directly
computed using molecular dynamics simulations. The elastic and transport
coefficients are then compared to the values of the same coefficients obtained
with the method of Helfand moments, showing good agreement and providing strong
support for the microscopic hydrodynamic theory of perfect crystals based on
the local-equilibrium approach.

<h3>Floating active carpets drive transport and aggregation in aquatic  ecosystems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11764" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11764</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriel Aguayo, Arnold J.T.M. Mathijssen, Hugo N. Ulloa, Rodrigo Soto, Francisca Guzman-Lastra</i>
<p>Communities of swimming microorganisms often thrive near liquid-air
interfaces. We study how such `active carpets' shape their aquatic environment
by driving biogenic transport in the water column beneath the active carpet.
The collective flows that these organisms generate lead to diffusive upward
fluxes of nutrients from deeper water layers, and downward fluxes of oxygen and
carbon. Combining analytical theory and simulations, we examine the key
transport metrics including the single and pair diffusivity, the first passage
time for particle pair encounters, and the rate of particle aggregation. Our
findings reveal that the hydrodynamic fluctuations driven by active carpets
have a region of influence that reaches orders of magnitude further in distance
than the size of the organisms. These non-equilibrium fluctuations lead to a
strongly enhanced diffusion of particles, which is anisotropic and
space-dependent. The fluctuations also facilitate encounters of particle pairs,
which we quantify by analyzing their velocity pair correlation functions as a
function of distance between the particles. We found that the size of the
particles plays a crucial role in their encounter rates, with larger particles
situated near the active carpet being more favourable for aggregation. Overall,
this research has broadened our comprehension of aquatic systems out of
equilibrium, particularly how biologically driven fluctuations contribute to
the transport of fundamental elements in biogeochemical cycles.

<h3>Symbolic Learning for Material Discovery</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11487" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11487</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Cunnington, Flaviu Cipcigan, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira, Jonathan Booth</i>
<p>Discovering new materials is essential to solve challenges in climate change,
sustainability and healthcare. A typical task in materials discovery is to
search for a material in a database which maximises the value of a function.
That function is often expensive to evaluate, and can rely upon a simulation or
an experiment. Here, we introduce SyMDis, a sample efficient optimisation
method based on symbolic learning, that discovers near-optimal materials in a
large database. SyMDis performs comparably to a state-of-the-art optimiser,
whilst learning interpretable rules to aid physical and chemical verification.
Furthermore, the rules learned by SyMDis generalise to unseen datasets and
return high performing candidates in a zero-shot evaluation, which is difficult
to achieve with other approaches.

<h3>Tracking Intrinsic Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Lossy Lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11490</a>
<br>
<i>Liwei Xiong, Qicheng Zhang, Xiling Feng, Yufei Leng, Min Pi, Shuaishuai Tong, Chunyin Qiu</i>
<p>Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by a majority of eigenstates
localized at open boundaries, is one of the most iconic phenomena in
non-Hermitian lattices. Despite notable experimental studies implemented, most
of them witness only certain signs of the NHSE rather than the intrinsic
exponential localization inherent in eigenstates, owing to the ubiquitous and
inevitable background loss. Even worse, the experimental observation of the
NHSE would be completely obscured in highly lossy cases. Here, we theoretically
propose a dual test approach to eliminate the destructive loss effect and track
the intrinsic NHSE that is essentially irrelevant to background loss.
Experimentally, the effectiveness of this approach is precisely validated by
one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian acoustic lattices. Our study sheds new
light on the previously untapped intrinsic aspect of the NHSE, which is of
particular significance in non-Hermitian topological physics.

<h3>Collective excitation of bosonic quantum Hall state</h3>

<br>
<i>Moumita Indra, Sandip Mondal</i>
<p>The recent developments in the theory of rapidly rotating Bose atoms have
been reviewed in this article. Rotation leads to the development of
quantized-vortices, that cluster into a vortex array, exactly to how superfluid
helium behaves. Theoretically, a number of strongly correlated phases are
projected to exist in this domain, which might be thought of as bosonic
counterparts of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). It is now possible for
bosons associating with a short-range interaction to exhibit a FQHE, because
the system of neutral bosons in a fast rotating atomic trap is analogous to
charged bosons placed in a fictitious magnetic field. The neutral collective
spin-conserving and spin-flip excitation for the rotating ultra-cold dilute
Bose atoms in the FQHE domain are being discussed. We have introduced a
realistic interaction between the Bose particles together with long-range
interaction and presented a short review article about various fractional
quantum Hall states and their spin conserving and spin reversed collective
modes.

<h3>Essay: Where Can Quantum Geometry Lead Us?</h3>

<i>Paivi Torma</i>
<p>Quantum geometry defines the phase and amplitude distances between quantum
states. The phase distance is characterized by the Berry curvature and thus
relates to topological phenomena. The significance of the full quantum
geometry, including the amplitude distance characterized by the quantum metric,
has started to receive attention in the last few years. Various quantum
transport and interaction phenomena have been found to be critically influenced
by quantum geometry. For example, quantum geometry allows counterintuitive flow
of supercurrent in a flat band where single electrons are immobile. In this
Essay, I will discuss my view of the important open problems and future
applications of this research topic and will try to inspire the reader to come
up with further ideas. At its best, quantum geometry can open a new chapter in
band theory and lead to breakthroughs as transformative as room-temperature
superconductivity. However, first, more experiments directly showing the effect
of quantum geometry are needed. We also have to integrate quantum geometry
analysis in our most advanced numerical methods. Further, the ramifications of
quantum geometry should be studied in a wider range, including electric and
electromagnetic responses and interaction phenomena in free- and
correlated-electron materials, bosonic systems, optics, and other fields.

<h3>Phenomenology of Majorana zero modes in full-shell hybrid nanowires</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11613" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11613</a>
<br>
<i>Carlos Payá, Samuel D. Escribano, Andrea Vezzosi, Fernando Peñaranda, Ramón Aguado, Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada</i>
<p>Full-shell nanowires have been proposed as an alternative nanowire design in
the search of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs).
They are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconductor core fully covered
by a thin superconductor shell and subject to a magnetic flux. In this work we
critically examine this proposal, finding a very rich spectral phenomenology
that combines the Little-Parks modulation of the parent-gap superconductor with
flux, the presence of flux-dispersing Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analog
subgap states, and the emergence of MZMs across finite flux intervals that
depend on the transverse wavefunction profile of the charge density in the core
section. Through microscopic simulations and analytical derivations, we study
different regimes for the semiconductor core, ranging from the hollow-core
approximation, to the tubular-core nanowire appropriate for a semiconductor
tube with an insulating core, to the solid-core nanowire. We compute the phase
diagrams for the different models in cylindrical nanowires and find that MZMs
typically coexist with CdGM analogs at zero energy, rendering them gapless.
However, we also find topologically protected parameter regions, or islands,
with gapped MZMs. In this sense, the most promising candidate to obtain
topologically protected MZMs in a full-shell geometry is the nanowire with a
tubular-shaped core. Moving beyond pristine nanowires, we study the effect of
mode mixing perturbations. Strikingly, mode mixing can act like a topological
$p$-wave pairing between particle-hole Bogoliubov partners, and is therefore
able to create new topologically protected MZMs in regions of the phase diagram
that were originally trivial. As a result, the phase diagram is utterly
transformed and exhibits protected MZMs in around half of the parameter space.

<h3>The Nordic-walking mechanism and its explanation of deconfined  pseudocriticality from Wess-Zumino-Witten theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11614" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11614</a>
<br>
<i>Bilal Hawashin, Astrid Eichhorn, Lukas Janssen, Michael M. Scherer, Shouryya Ray</i>
<p>The understanding of phenomena falling outside the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm
of phase transitions represents a key challenge in condensed matter physics. A
famous class of examples is constituted by the putative deconfined quantum
critical points between two symmetry-broken phases in layered quantum magnets,
such as pressurised SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. Experiments find a weak first-order
transition, which simulations of relevant microscopic models can reproduce. The
origin of this behaviour has been a matter of considerable debate for several
years. In this work, we demonstrate that the nature of the deconfined quantum
critical point can be best understood in terms of a novel dynamical mechanism,
termed Nordic walking. Nordic walking denotes a renormalisation group flow
arising from a beta function that is flat over a range of couplings. This gives
rise to a logarithmic flow that is faster than the well-known walking
behaviour, associated with the annihilation and complexification of fixed
points, but still significantly slower than the generic running of couplings.
The Nordic-walking mechanism can thus explain weak first-order transitions, but
may also play a role in high-energy physics, where it could solve hierarchy
problems.
We analyse the Wess-Zumino-Witten field theory pertinent to deconfined
quantum critical points with a topological term in 2+1 dimensions. To this end,
we construct an advanced functional renormalisation group approach based on
higher-order regulators. We thereby calculate the beta function directly in 2+1
dimensions and provide evidence for Nordic walking.

<h3>Moiré Fractional Chern Insulators III: Hartree-Fock Phase Diagram,  Magic Angle Regime for Chern Insulator States, the Role of the Moiré  Potential and Goldstone Gaps in Rhombohedral Graphene Superlattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11617" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11617</a>
<br>
<i>Yves H. Kwan, Jiabin Yu, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Dmitri K. Efetov, Nicolas Regnault, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<p>We investigate in detail the $\nu=+1$ displacement-field-tuned interacting
phase diagram of $L=3,4,5,6,7$ layer rhombohedral graphene aligned to hBN
(R$L$G/hBN). Our calculations account for the 3D nature of the Coulomb
interaction, the inequivalent stacking orientations $\xi=0,1$, the effects of
the filled valence bands, and the choice of `interaction scheme' for specifying
the many-body Hamiltonian. We show that the latter has a dramatic impact on the
Hartree-Fock phase boundaries and the properties of the phases, including for
pentalayers (R5G/hBN) with large displacement field $D$ where recent
experiments observed a Chern insulator at $\nu=+1$ and fractional Chern
insulators for $\nu<1$. In this large $D$ regime, the low-energy conduction
bands are polarized away from the aligned hBN layer, and are hence
well-described by the folded bands of moir\'eless rhombohedral graphene at the
non-interacting level. Despite this, the filled valence bands develop
moir\'e-periodic charge density variations which can generate an effective
moir\'e potential, thereby explicitly breaking the approximate continuous
translation symmetry in the conduction bands, and leading to contrasting
electronic topology in the ground state for the two stacking arrangements.
Within time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory, we further characterize the strength
of the moir\'e pinning potential in the Chern insulator phase by computing the
low-energy $\mathbf{q}=0$ collective mode spectrum, where we identify competing
gapped pseudophonon and valley magnon excitations. Our results emphasize the
importance of careful examination of both the single-particle and interaction
model for a proper understanding of the correlated phases in R$L$G/hBN.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Dyson equations for strongly coupled light and matter:  spin glass formation in multi-mode cavity QED</h3>

<i>Hossein Hosseinabadi, Darrick E. Chang, Jamir Marino</i>
<p>Light-matter interfaces have now entered a new stage marked by the ability to
engineer quantum correlated states under driven-dissipative conditions. To
propel this new generation of experiments, we are confronted with the need to
model non-unitary many-body dynamics in strongly coupled regimes, by
transcending traditional approaches in quantum optics. In this work, we
contribute to this program by adapting a functional integral technique,
conventionally employed in high-energy physics, in order to derive
nonequilibrium Dyson equations for interacting light-matter systems. Our
approach is grounded in constructing two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective
actions, which provide a non-perturbative and conserving framework for
describing quantum evolution at a polynomial cost in time. One of the aims of
the article is to offer a pedagogical introduction designed to bridge readers
from diverse scientific communities, including those in quantum optics,
condensed matter, and high-energy physics. We apply our method to complement
the analysis of spin glass formation in the context of frustrated multi-mode
cavity quantum electrodynamics, initiated in our accompanying work [H.
Hosseinabadi, D. Chang, J. Marino, arXiv:2311.05682]. Finally, we outline the
capability of the technique to describe other near-term platforms in many-body
quantum optics, and its potential to make predictions for this new class of
experiments.

<h3>Incommensurate magnetic order: a fingerprint for electronic correlations  in hole-doped cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11628</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Klett, Jacob Beyer, David Riegler, Jannis Seufert, Peter Wölfle, Stephan Rachel, Ronny Thomale</i>
<p>Intertwined charge and magnetic fluctuations in high-$T_\text{c}$ copper
oxide superconductors (cuprates) are hypothesized to be a consequence of their
correlated electronic nature. Among other observables, this is apparent in the
doping dependence of incommensurate magnetic order, known as the Yamada
relation (YR). We analyze the Hubbard model to challenge the universality of YR
as a function of interaction strength $U$ through Kotliar-Ruckenstein
slave-boson (SB) mean-field theory and truncated unity functional
renormalization group (TUFRG). While TUFRG tends to lock in to a doping
dependence of the incommensurate magnetic ordering vector obtained for the
perturbative weak-coupling limit, SB not only exhibits an enhanced sensitivity
upon a variation of $U$ from weak to strong coupling, but also shows good
agreement with experimental data. It supports the placement of weakly
hole-doped cuprates in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime.

<h3>Direct observation of a magnetic field-induced Wigner crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11632</a>
<br>
<i>Yen-Chen Tsui, Minhao He, Yuwen Hu, Ethan Lake, Taige Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Michael P. Zaletel, Ali Yazdani</i>
<p>Eugene Wigner predicted long ago that when the Coulomb interactions between
electrons become much stronger than their kinetic energy, electrons crystallize
into a closely packed lattice. A variety of two-dimensional systems have shown
evidence for Wigner crystals; however, a spontaneously formed classical or
quantum Wigner crystal (WC) has never been directly visualized. Neither the
identification of the WC symmetry nor direct investigation of its melting has
been accomplished. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) measurements to directly image a magnetic field-induced electron WC in
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and examine its structural properties as
a function of electron density, magnetic field, and temperature. At high fields
and the lowest temperature, we observe a triangular lattice electron WC in the
lowest Landau Level (LLL) of BLG. The WC possesses the expected lattice
constant and is robust in a range of filling factors between $\nu\sim$ 0.13 and
$\nu\sim$ 0.38 except near fillings where it competes with fractional quantum
Hall (FQH) states. Increasing the density or temperature results in the melting
of the WC into a liquid phase that is isotropic but has a modulated structure
characterized by the WC's Bragg wavevector. At low magnetic fields, the WC
unexpectedly transitions into an anisotropic stripe phase, which has been
commonly anticipated to form in higher LLs. Analysis of individual lattice
sites reveals signatures that may be related to the quantum zero-point motion
of electrons in the WC lattice.

<h3>Experimentally tunable QED in dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11641</a>
<br>
<i>Han Yan, Alaric Sanders, Claudio Castelnovo, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</i>
<p>We propose a readily achievable experimental setting where an external
magnetic field is used to tune the emergent quantum electrodynamics (eQED) of
dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ice (DO-QSI). When the octupolar interactions
dominate, we find that a weak field tunes the DO-QSI's quantum dynamics without
lifting the degeneracy of the low-energy ice-state manifold. This is a unique
advantage compared to conventional quantum spin ice. In $U(1)_\pi$ DO-QSI - the
proposed ground state of QSI candidates Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$
and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ - the field tunes the emergent speed of light (and,
consequently, the emergent fine structure constant). Depending on the field's
alignment with the crystal, one may induce different speeds of light for the
two polarizations of the emergent photons, in a fascinating analogue of the
electro-optic Kerr effect. In $U(1)_0$ DO-QSI - yet to be uncovered
experimentally - we find a number of unusual field-induced transitions,
including a transition between $0$- and $\pi$-flux QSI phases, as well as
phases with frustrated flux configurations. Our proposal opens the gate to a
plethora of experimentally accessible, engineerable eQED phenomena in the
emergent universes of quantum spin ice.

<h3>Layer Hall counterflow as a model probe of magic-angle twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11662" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11662</a>
<br>
<i>Jihang Zhu, Dawei Zhai, Cong Xiao, Wang Yao</i>
<p>The recent constructions of flat moir\'e minibands in specifically twisted
multilayer graphene and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have
facilitated the observation of strong correlations with a convenient
tunability. These correlations in flat bands result in the band dispersion
heavily influenced by carrier densities, leading to filling-dependent
quasiparticle band renormalizations. Particularly, in magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene (MATBG), the band structure--including the quasiparticle
energy and wavefunction--is crucial in understanding the correlated properties.
Previous theoretical studies have demonstrated the presence of a
time-reversal-even charge Hall counterflow in response to a direct current (DC)
electric field in twisted bilayers as chiral structures. In this study, we show
that such layer Hall counterflow can serve as a sensitive probe for MATBG model
parameters, which are currently ambiguous as a result of unavoidable structural
relaxation and twist-angle disorder. We present the layer Hall counterflow and
the associated in-plane magnetization for three different MATBG continuum
models, based on which many-body interacting models have been widely applied to
study strong correlations in MATBG. At the single-particle level, our findings
indicate notable differences in layer-projected Hall conductivity, both in
magnitude and sign, between different MATBG continuum models. Furthermore, our
self-consistent Hartree calculations, performed on each of these
single-particle continuum models, reveal renormalized layer-projected Hall
conductivity by the self-consistent Hartree field.

<h3>Creep failure of hierarchical materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11680" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11680</a>
<br>
<i>Mahshid Pournajar, Paolo Moretti, Seyyed Ahmad Hosseini, Michael Zaiser</i>
<p>Creep failure of hierarchical materials is investigated by simulation of beam
network models. Such models are idealizations of hierarchical fibrous materials
where bundles of load-carrying fibers are held together by multi-level
(hierarchical) cross-links. Failure of individual beams is assumed to be
governed by stress-assisted thermal activation over local barriers, and beam
stresses are computed by solving the global balance equations of linear and
angular momentum across the network. Disorder is mimicked by a statistical
distribution of barrier heights. Both initially intact samples and samples
containing side notches of various length are considered. Samples with
hierarchical cross-link patterns are simulated alongside reference samples
where cross-links are placed randomly without hierarchical organization. The
results demonstrate that hierarchical patterning may strongly increase creep
strain and creep lifetime while reducing the lifetime variation. This is due to
the fact that hierarchical patterning induces a failure mode that differs
significantly from the standard scenario of failure by nucleation and growth of
a critical crack. Characterization of this failure mode demonstrates good
agreement between the present simulations and experimental findings on
hierarchically patterned paper sheets.

<h3>Tuning for fluidity using fluctuations in biological tissue models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11683</a>
<br>
<i>Sadjad Arzash, Indrajit Tah, Andrea J. Liu, M. Lisa Manning</i>
<p>How do biological systems tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues?
One class of such emergent behaviors, important to biological functions such as
body-axis elongation, involves rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes
from a fluid-like state to a solid-like state or vice versa. Here, we explore
the idea that tissues might tune ``learning degrees of freedom" to affect this
emergent behavior. We study tissue fluidity in the 2D vertex model, using the
vertex model energy as a learning cost function and the cell stiffnesses,
target shapes, and target areas as sets of learning degrees of freedom that can
be varied to minimize the energy. We show that the rigidity transition is
unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as learning degrees of freedom.
When preferred perimeters or areas are treated as learning degrees of freedom,
however, energy minimization introduces spatial correlations in target cell
shapes or areas that shift the rigidity transition. There is an optimal
heterogeneity of target cell shapes or areas to enable learning. These
observations suggest that biological tissues can learn tissue-scale behaviors
by tuning their individual cell properties.

<h3>Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Low Density and Dirac Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11693" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11693</a>
<br>
<i>Anqi Mu, Zhiyuan Sun, Andrew J. Millis</i>
<p>The qualitative reliability of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) is
investigated for systems in which either the actual carrier density or the
effective carrier density is low, by comparing the exact perturbative and
dynamical mean field expressions of electron scattering rates and optical
conductivities. We study two interacting systems: tight binding models in which
the chemical potential is near a band edge and Dirac systems in which the
chemical potential is near the Dirac point. In both systems it is found that
DMFT underestimates the low frequency, near-Fermi surface single particle
scattering rate by a factor proportional to the particle density. The
quasiparticle effective mass is qualitatively incorrect for the low density
tight binding model but not necessarily for Dirac systems. The dissipative part
of the optical conductivity is more subtle: in the exact calculation vertex
corrections, typically neglected in DMFT calculations, suppress the low
frequency optical absorption, compensating for some of the DMFT underestimate
of the scattering rate. The role of vertex corrections in calculating the
conductivity for Dirac systems is clarified and a systematic discussion is
given of the approach to the Galilean/Lorentz invariant low density limit.
Relevance to recent calculations related to Weyl metals is discussed.

<i>Giulia Zheng, Elías Portolés, Alexandra Mestre-Torá, Marta Perego, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Peter Rickhaus, Folkert K. de Vries, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin, Shuichi Iwakiri</i>
<p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) combines in one single material
different phases like insulating, metallic and superconducting. These phases
and their in-situ tunability make MATBG an important platform for the
fabrication of superconducting devices. We realize a split gate-defined
geometry which enables us to tune the width of a superconducting channel formed
in MATBG. We observe a smooth transition from superconductivity to highly
resistive transport by progressively reducing the channel width using the split
gates or by reducing the density in the channel. Using the gate-defined
constriction, we control the flow of the supercurrent, either guiding it
through the constriction or throughout the whole device or even blocking its
passage completely. This serves as a foundation for developing quantum
constriction devices like superconducting quantum point contacts, quantum dots,
and Cooper-pair boxes in MATBG.

<br>
<i>M. Grundner, P. Westhoff, F. B. Kugler, O. Parcollet, U. Schollwöck</i>
<p>Real-time calculations in tensor networks are strongly limited in time by
entanglement growth, restricting the achievable frequency resolution of Green's
functions, spectral functions, self-energies, and other related quantities. By
extending the time evolution to contours in the complex plane, entanglement
growth is curtailed, enabling numerically efficient high-precision calculations
of time-dependent correlators and Green's functions with detailed frequency
resolution. Various approaches to time evolution in the complex plane and the
required post-processing for extracting the pure real-time and frequency
information are compared. We benchmark our results on the examples of the
single-impurity Anderson model using matrix-product states and of the
three-band Hubbard-Kanamori and Dworin-Narath models using a tree tensor
network. Our findings indicate that the proposed methods are also applicable to
challenging realistic calculations of materials.

<h3>Accelerating the prediction of inorganic surfaces with machine learning  interatomic potentials</h3>

<i>Kyle Noordhoek, Christopher J. Bartel</i>
<p>The surface properties of solid-state materials often dictate their
functionality, especially for applications where nanoscale effects become
important. The relevant surface(s) and their properties are determined, in
large part, by the materials synthesis or operating conditions. These
conditions dictate thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic rates responsible
for yielding the observed surface structure and morphology. Computational
surface science methods have long been applied to connect thermochemical
conditions to surface phase stability, particularly in the heterogeneous
catalysis and thin film growth communities. This review provides a brief
introduction to first-principles approaches to compute surface phase diagrams
before introducing emerging data-driven approaches. The remainder of the review
focuses on the application of machine learning, predominantly in the form of
learned interatomic potentials, to study complex surfaces. As machine learning
algorithms and large datasets on which to train them become more commonplace in
materials science, computational methods are poised to become even more
predictive and powerful for modeling the complexities of inorganic surfaces at
the nanoscale.

<h3>Marginal phase transition in decorated single-chain Ising models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11722</a>

<i>Weiguo Yin</i>
<p>Since Ernst Ising's proof one century ago, it has been well-known that phase
transition at finite temperature does not exist in the Ising model with
short-range interactions in one dimension. Yet, little is known about whether
this forbidden transition could be approached arbitrarily closely -- at fixed
finite temperature. To explore such asymptoticity, the notion of marginal phase
transition (MPT) was introduced recently and spontaneous MPT was successfully
found in decorated ladder Ising models. On the other hand, in the presence of a
magnetic field, narrow phase crossover termed as pseudo-transition was found in
decorated single-chain Ising models with strong geometric frustration; it is
thus imperative to know whether the pseudo-transition could be transformed to
approach a genuine transition at fixed finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily
closely, i.e., being the MPT. Here, I reveal the existence of the field-induced
MPT in decorated Ising chains, in which $T_0$ is determined by the interactions
involving only the decorated parts and the magnetic field, while the crossover
width $2\delta T$ is independently, exponentially reduced ($\delta T = 0$ means
a genuine transition) by the previously neglected ferromagnetic interaction
between the ordinary spins on the chain backbone. Furthermore, I show that the
MPT can be realized even in the decorated Ising chains without geometric
frustration because the magnetic field itself can induce previously unnoticed
hidden spin frustration. These findings manifest that MPT is essentially the
buildup of coherence in preformed crossover of any local states, making the
doors wide open to the engineering and utilization of MPT as a new paradigm for
exploring exotic phenomena and 1D device applications.

<p>The two-dimensional (2D) material Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is a member of the class
of insulating van der Waals magnets. Here, using high resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy in a detailed temperature dependence study, we
identify a clear response of the electronic structure to a dimensional
crossover in the form of two distinct temperature scales marking onsets of
modifications in the electronic structure. Specifically, we observe Te
$p$-orbital-dominated bands to undergo changes at the Curie transition
temperature T$_C$ while the Cr $d$-orbital-dominated bands begin evolving at a
higher temperature scale. Combined with neutron scattering, density functional
theory calculations, and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the electronic
system can be consistently understood to respond sequentially to the distinct
temperatures at which in-plane and out-of-plane spin correlations exceed a
characteristic length scale. Our findings reveal the sensitivity of the
orbital-selective electronic structure for probing the dynamical evolution of
local moment correlations in vdW insulating magnets.

<h3>Disentangling the Physics of the Attractive Hubbard Model via the  Accessible and Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement Entropies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11746" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11746</a>

<p>The complicated ways in which electrons interact in many-body systems such as
molecules and materials have long been viewed through the lens of local
electron correlation and associated correlation functions. However, quantum
information science has demonstrated that more global diagnostics of quantum
states, like the entanglement entropy, can provide a complementary and
clarifying lens on electronic behavior. One particularly useful measure that
can be used to distinguish between quantum and classical sources of
entanglement is the accessible entanglement, the entanglement available as a
quantum resource for systems subject to conservation laws, such as fixed
particle number, due to superselection rules. In this work, we introduce an
algorithm and demonstrate how to compute accessible and symmetry-resolved
entanglements for interacting fermion systems. This is accomplished by
combining an incremental version of the swap algorithm with a recursive
Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm recently developed by the
authors. We apply these tools to study the pairing and charge density waves
exhibited in the paradigmatic attractive Hubbard model via entanglement. We
find that the particle and spin symmetry-resolved entanglements and their
related full probability distribution functions show very clear - and unique -
signatures of the underlying electronic behavior even when those features are
less pronounced in more conventional correlation functions. Overall, this work
provides a systematic means of characterizing the entanglement within quantum
systems that can grant a deeper understanding of the complicated electronic
behavior that underlies quantum phase transitions and crossovers in many-body
systems.

<h3>Computational insights into phase equilibria between wide-gap  semiconductors and contact materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11749" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11749</a>
<br>
<i>Cheng-Wei Lee, Andriy Zakutayev, Vladan Stevanović</i>
<p>Novel wide-band-gap semiconductors are needed for next-generation power
electronic but there is a gap between a promising material and a functional
device. Finding stable contacts is one of the major challenges, which is
currently dealt with mainly via trial and error. Herein, we computationally
investigate the thermochemistry and phase co-existence at the junction between
three wide gap semiconductors, $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$, GeO$_2$, and GaN, and
possible contact materials. The pool of possible contacts includes 47 elemental
metals and 4 common $n$-type transparent conducting oxides (ZnO, TiO$_2$,
SnO$_2$, and In$_2$O$_3$). We use first-principles thermodynamics to model the
Gibbs free energies of chemical reactions as a function of the gas pressure
(p$_{\mathrm{O}_2}$/p$_{\mathrm{N}_2}$) and equilibrium temperature. We deduce
whether a semiconductor/contact interface will be stable at relevant
conditions, possibly influencing the long-term reliability and performance of
devices. We generally find that most elemental metals tend to oxidize or
nitridize and form various interface oxide/nitride layers. Exceptions include
select late- and post-transition metals, and in case of GaN also the alkali
metals, which are predicted to exhibit stable coexistence, although in many
cases at relatively low gas partial pressures. Similar is true for the
transparent conducting oxides, for which in most cases we predict a preference
toward forming ternary oxides when in contact with $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and
GeO$_{2}$. The only exception is SnO$_2$, which can form stable contacts with
both oxides. Finally, we show how the same approach can be used to predict gas
partial pressure vs. temperature phase diagrams to help direct synthesis of
ternary compounds. We believe these results provide a valuable guidance in
selecting contact materials to wide-gap semiconductors and suitable growth
conditions.

<h3>Accurate prediction of thermal conductivity of Al2O3 at ultrahigh  temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11755</a>
<br>
<i>Janak Tiwari, Tianli Feng</i>
<p>Many complex crystals show a flattening or even increasing lattice thermal
conductivity at high temperatures, which deviates from the traditional 1/T
decay trend given by conventional phonon theory. In this work, we predict the
thermal conductivity of Al2O3 that matches with experimental data from room
temperature to near melting point (2200 K). The lattice thermal conductivity is
found to be composed of contributions of phonon, diffuson, and radiation.
Phonon particle thermal conductivity decays approximately as ~T^-1.14 after
considering four-phonon scattering as well as finite temperature corrections to
lattice constant, harmonic, and anharmonic force constants. Diffuson
(inter-band tunneling) thermal conductivity increases roughly as ~T^0.43.
Radiation thermal conductivity increases as ~T2.51, being slightly smaller than
~T^3 due to the increase of phonon linewidth with temperature, which increases
photon extinction coefficient and reduces photon mean free path. At room
temperature, phonon, diffuson, and radiation contribute about 99%, 1%, and 0,
respectively. At 2200 K, the contributions change to 61%, 20%, and 19%,
respectively. Four-phonon scattering is important at ultra-high temperature,
decreasing the phonon thermal conductivity by a maximum of 24%. The
finite-temperature softening effects of harmonic and anharmonic force constants
increase the phonon thermal conductivity by a maximum of 36% at ultra-high
temperatures. We also verify that Green-Kubo MD can capture phonons' both
particle and wave natures, similar to the Wigner formalism.

<h3>From Dry to Wet Vertex Model Dynamics: Generating Sustained Flows</h3>

<br>
<i>Jan Rozman, Chaithanya K. V. S., Julia M. Yeomans, Rastko Sknepnek</i>
<p>Complex tissue flows in epithelia are driven by intra- and inter-cellular
processes that generate, maintain, and coordinate mechanical forces. There has
been growing evidence that cell shape anisotropy, manifested as nematic order,
plays an important role in this process. Here we extend a nematic vertex model
by replacing substrate friction with internal viscous dissipation, of relevance
to epithelia not supported by a substrate or the extracellular matrix, such as
many early-stage embryos. When coupled to cell shape anisotropy, the internal
viscous dissipation allows for long-range velocity correlations and thus
enables the spontaneous emergence of flows with a large degree of
spatiotemporal organisation. We demonstrate sustained flow in epithelial sheets
confined to a channel, thus providing a link between the dynamical behaviour of
continuum active nematics and the cell-level vertex model of tissue dynamics.

<p>Twisted vdW quantum materials have emerged as a rapidly developing field of
2D semiconductors. These materials establish a new central research area and
provide a promising platform for studying quantum phenomena and investigating
the engineering of novel optoelectronic properties such as single-photon
emission, non-linear optical response, magnon physics, and topological
superconductivity. These captivating electronic and optical properties result
from, and can be tailored by, the interlayer coupling using moir\'e patterns
formed by vertically stacking atomic layers with controlled angle
misorientation or lattice mismatch. Their outstanding properties and the high
degree of tunability position them as compelling building blocks for both
compact quantum-enabled devices and classical optoelectronics. This article

light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and photodetectors. It highlights the
unique ability of moir\'e superlattices to connect multiple disciplines,
covering chemistry, electronics, optics, photonics, magnetism, topological and
quantum physics. This comprehensive review provides a valuable resource for

<h3>Defect-induced localization of information in 1D Kitaev model</h3>

<i>Varadharajan Muruganandam, Manas Sajjan, Sabre Kais</i>
<p>We discuss one-dimensional(1D) spin compass model or 1D Kitaev model in the
presence of local bond defects. Three types of local disorders concerning both
bond-nature and bond-strength that occur on kitaev materials have been
investigated. Using exact diagonalization, two-point spin-spin structural
correlations and four-point Out-of-Time-Order Correlators(OTOC) have been
computed for the defective spin chains. The proposed quantities give signatures
of these defects in terms of their responses to location and strength of
defects. A key observation is that the information in the OTOC space gets
trapped at the defect site giving rise to the phenomena of localization of
information thus making these correlators a suitable diagnostic tool to detect
and characterize these defects.

<h3>Feature-energy duality of topological boundary states in multilayer  quantum spin Hall insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Yueh-Ting Yao, Xiaoting Zhou, Yi-Chun Hung, Hsin Lin, Arun Bansil, Tay-Rong Chang</i>
<p>Gapless topological boundary states characterize nontrivial topological
phases arising from the bulk-boundary correspondence in symmetry-protected
topological materials, such as the emergence of helical edge states in a
two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator. However, the
incorporation of symmetry-breaking perturbation terms in the Hamiltonian leads
to the gapping of these edge bands, resulting in missing these crucial
topological boundary states. In this work, we systematically investigate the
robustness of bulk-boundary correspondence in the quantum spin Hall insulator
via recently introduced feature spectrum topology. Our findings present a
comprehensive understanding of feature-energy duality, illustrating that the
aggregate number of gapless edge states in the energy-momentum ($\it{E-k}$) map
and the non-trivial edge states in the $\hat{S}_z$ feature spectrum equals the
spin Chern number of multilayer quantum spin Hall insulator. We identify a van
der Waals material bismuth bromide $\rm(Bi_4Br_4)$ as a promising candidate
through first-principles calculations. Our work not only unravels the
intricacies of bulk-boundary correspondence but also charts a course for
exploring quantum spin Hall insulators with high spin-Chern number.

<h3>Fracture process of composite material in a spring network model</h3>

<br>
<i>Haruka Noguchi, Satoshi Yukawa</i>
<p>We analyze a two-dimensional spring network model comprising breakable and
unbreakable springs. Computer simulations showed this system to exhibit
intermittent stress drops in a larger strain regime, and these stress drops
resulted in ductile-like behavior. The scaling analysis reveals that the
avalanche size distribution demonstrates a cut-off, depending on its internal
structure. This study also investigates the relationship between cluster growth
and stress drop, and we show that the amount of stress drop increases in terms
of power law, corresponding to crack growth. The crack length distribution also
demonstrates a cut-off depending on its internal structure. The results show
that both the cluster growth-stress drop relationship and the crack size
distribution are scaled by the quantity related to the internal structure, and
the relevance of the exponent that scales the cluster growth-stress drop
relationship to the exponent that scales crack size distribution is verified.

<h3>Classification of complex local environments in systems of particle  shapes through shape-symmetry encoded data augmentation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11822" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11822</a>
<br>
<i>Shih-Kuang, Sun-Ting Tsai, Sharon Glotzer</i>
<p>Detecting and analyzing the local environment is crucial for investigating
the dynamical processes of crystal nucleation and shape colloidal particle
self-assembly. Recent developments in machine learning provide a promising
avenue for better order parameters in complex systems that are challenging to
study using traditional approaches. However, the application of machine
learning to self-assembly on systems of particle shapes is still underexplored.
To address this gap, we propose a simple, physics-agnostic, yet powerful
approach that involves training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a local
environment classifier for systems of particle shapes, using input features
such as particle distances and orientations. Our MLP classifier is trained in a
supervised manner with a shape symmetry-encoded data augmentation technique
without the need for any conventional roto-translations invariant symmetry
functions. We evaluate the performance of our classifiers on four different
scenarios involving self-assembly of cubic structures, 2-dimensional and
3-dimensional patchy particle shape systems, hexagonal bipyramids with varying
aspect ratios, and truncated shapes with different degrees of truncation. The
proposed training process and data augmentation technique are both
straightforward and flexible, enabling easy application of the classifier to
other processes involving particle orientations. Our work thus presents a
valuable tool for investigating self-assembly processes on systems of particle
shapes, with potential applications in structure identification of any
particle-based or molecular system where orientations can be defined.

<h3>Multiband Metallic Ground State in Multilayered Nickelates  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Revealed by $^{139}$La-NMR at  Ambient Pressure</h3>

<br>
<i>Masataka Kakoi, Takashi Oi, Yujiro Ohshita, Mitsuharu Yashima, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Yoshinobu Adachi, Naoyuki Hatada, Tetsuya Uda, Hidekazu Mukuda</i>
<p>We report a $^{139}$La-NMR study on the multiple($n$)-layered nickelates
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($n=2$) and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ ($n=3$) at ambient pressure.
Observations of the broadening in NMR spectra and the anomaly of nuclear spin
relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) indicate the emergence of density wave order with a
gap below $T^*\sim150$~K for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and $\sim130$~K for
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Below $T^*$, the behavior of $1/T_1T \sim const.$
indicates the metallic ground states with remaining density of states (DOS) at
the Fermi level ($E_{\rm F}$) under the density wave order, revealing the
existence of multiple $d$-electron bands with different characters. Above
$T^*$, the gradual decrease of $1/T_1T$ upon cooling indicates the presence of
a strong variation of DOS near $E_{\rm F}$. Since this feature disappears well
below $T^*$, it is inferred that the density wave gap opens at the band
associated with this structure in DOS at $E_{\rm F}$. From our microscopic
insights, we point out that these nickelates ($n=2$ and $3$) possess similar
electronic states despite the difference in the formal valence of the Ni
$d$-electron states, which provides with basis for understanding the novel
high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity under high pressures.

<h3>Anderson transition and mobility edges on hyperbolic lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Tianyu Li, Yi Peng, Yucheng Wang, Haiping Hu</i>
<p>Hyperbolic lattices, formed by tessellating the hyperbolic plane with regular
polygons, exhibit a diverse range of exotic physical phenomena beyond
conventional Euclidean lattices. Here, we investigate the impact of disorder on
hyperbolic lattices and reveal that the Anderson localization occurs at strong
disorder strength, accompanied by the presence of mobility edges. Taking the
hyperbolic $\{p,q\}=\{3,8\}$ and $\{p,q\}=\{4,8\}$ lattices as examples, we
employ finite-size scaling of both spectral statistics and the inverse
participation ratio to pinpoint the transition point and critical exponents.
Our findings indicate that the transition points tend to increase with larger
values of $\{p,q\}$ or curvature. In the limiting case of $\{\infty, q\}$, we
further determine its Anderson transition using the cavity method, drawing
parallels with the random regular graph. Our work lays the cornerstone for a
comprehensive understanding of Anderson transition and mobility edges in
non-Euclidean lattices.

<h3>Informatics-based learning of oxygen vacancy ordering principles in  oxygen-deficient perovskites</h3>

<br>
<i>Yongjin Shin, Kenneth R. Poeppelmeier, James M. Rondinelli</i>
<p>Ordered oxygen vacancies (OOVs) in perovskites can exhibit long-range order
and may be used to direct materials properties through modifications in
electronic structures and broken symmetries. Based on the various vacancy
patterns observed in previously known compounds, we explore the ordering
principles of OOVs in oxygen-deficient perovskite oxides with
$AB\mathrm{O}_{2.5}$ stoichiometry to identify other OOV variants. We performed
first-principles calculations to assess the OOV stability on a dataset of 50
OOV structures generated from our bespoke algorithm. The algorithm employs
uniform planar vacancy patterns on (111) pseudocubic perovskite layers and the
approach proves effective for generating stable OOV patterns with minimal
computational loads. We find as expected that the major factors determining the
stability of OOV structures include coordination preferences of transition
metals and elastic penalties resulting from the assemblies of polyhedra.
Cooperative rotational modes of polyhedra within OOV structures reduce elastic
instabilities by optimizing the bond valence of $A$- and $B$-cations. This
finding explains the observed formation of vacancy channels along low-index
crystallographic directions in prototypical OOV phases. The identified ordering
principles enable us to devise other stable vacancy patterns with longer
periodicity for targeted property design in yet to be synthesized compounds.

<br>
<i>Chang-Yan Wang</i>
<p>The development of ultracold atom technology has enabled the precise
investigations into quantum dynamics of quantum gases. Recently, inspired by
experimental advancement, the $SU(1,1)$ echo, akin to the well-known $SU(2)$
spin echo, has been proposed for single-component Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC). In this paper, we investigate the possibility of quantum echo in the
more intricate two-component BEC using the non-compact Lie group $Sp(4,R)$,
which describes the quantum dynamics of such systems. We demonstrate that
quantum echo can occur for the fully condensed state, as well as any $Sp(4,R)$
coherent state by applying a driving protocol consisting of two steps in each
period. The first step can be any Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, while the second step
is a Hamiltonian with all interactions turned off, which plays a similar role
as the $\pi$-pulse in spin echo. We confirm our theoretical results with
numerical calculations for different examples of two-component BEC. We further
consider the effect of interactions between the excited boson modes on the
quantum echo process and discuss the possible experiment implementation of this
quantum echo.

<p>Sila-cyclic rings are a class of organosilicon cyclic compounds and have
abundant application in organic chemistry and materials science. However, it is
still challenging to synthesize compounds with sila-cyclic rings in solution
chemistry due to their low solubility and high reactivity. Recently, on-surface
synthesis was introduced into organosilicon chemistry as 1,4- disilabenzene
bridged nanostructures were obtained via coupling between bromo-substituted
molecules and silicon atoms on Au(111). Here, we extend this strategy for
syntheses of silole derivatives and graphene nanoribbons with eight-membered
sila-cyclic rings from 2,2',6,6'- tetrabromobiphenyl and
1,4,5,8-tetrabromonaphthalene on Au(111), respectively. Their structures and
electronic properties were investigated by a combination of scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This work
demonstrates a generality of this synthesis strategy to fabricate various

<i>Qian Xiao, Oleg Janson, Sonia Francoual, Qingzheng Qiu, Qizhi Li, Shilong Zhang, Wu Xie, Pablo Bereciartua, Jeroen van den Brink, Jasper van Wezel, Yingying Peng</i>
<p>Chiral phases of matter, characterized by a definite handedness, abound in
nature, ranging from the crystal structure of quartz to spiraling spin states
in helical magnets. In $1T$-TiSe$_2$ a source of chirality has been proposed
that stands apart from these classical examples as it arises from combined
electronic charge and quantum orbital fluctuations. This may allow its
chirality to be accessed and manipulated without imposing either structural or
magnetic handedness. However, direct bulk evidence that broken inversion
symmetry and chirality are intrinsic to TiSe$_2$ remains elusive. Here,
employing resonant elastic scattering of x-rays, we reveal the presence of
giant circular dichroism up to $\sim$ 40$\%$ at forbidden Bragg peaks that
emerge at the charge and orbital ordering transition. The dichroism varies
dramatically with incident energy and azimuthal angle. Comparison to calculated
scattering intensities unambiguously traces its origin to bulk chiral
electronic order in ${\mathrm{TiSe}}_2$ and establishes resonant elastic x-ray
scattering as a sensitive probe to electronic chirality.

<i>Bharti Bharti, Andreas Carlson, Tak Shing Chan, Thomas Salez</i>
<p>We theoretically study the Plateau-Rayleigh instability of a thin viscous
film covering a fiber consisting of a rigid cylindrical core coated with a thin
compressible elastic layer. We develop a soft-lubrication model, combining the
capillary-driven flow in the viscous film to the elastic deformation of the
soft coating, within the Winkler-foundation framework. We perform a
linear-stability analysis and derive the dispersion relation. We find that the
growth rate is larger when the soft coating is more compliant. As such,
softness acts as a destabilising factor. In contrast, increasing the thickness
of the soft coating reduces the growth rate, due to the dominating geometrical
effect.

<h3>Long-living prethermalization in nearly integrable spin ladders</h3>

<br>
<i>J. Pawlowski, M. Panfil, J. Herbrych, M. Mierzejewski</i>
<p>Relaxation rates in nearly integrable systems usually increase quadratically
with the strength of the perturbation that breaks integrability. We show that
the relaxation rates can be significantly smaller in systems that are
integrable along two intersecting lines in the parameter space. In the vicinity
of the intersection point, the relaxation rates of certain observables increase
with the fourth power of the distance from this point, whereas for other
observables one observes standard quadratic dependence on the perturbation. As
a result, one obtains exceedingly long-living prethermalization but with a
reduced number of the nearly conserved operators. We show also that such a
scenario can be realized in spin ladders.

<h3>Engineering complete delocalization of single particle states in a class  of one dimensional aperiodic lattices: a quantum dynamical study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11977</a>
<br>
<i>Sougata Biswas, Arunava Chakrabarti</i>
<p>We study quantum dynamics of a wave packet on a class of one dimensional
aperiodic lattices, described within a tight binding formalism. The lattices
are stubbed with one or more atoms, tunnel coupled to the backbone, thereby
introducing a minimal quasi-one dimensionality. It is seen that, for a group of
such lattices a certain correlation between the numerical values of the hopping
amplitudes leads to a complete delocalization of single particle states. In
some other cases, a special value of a magnetic flux trapped in the loops
present in the geometries delocalize the states, leading to a flux driven
insulator to metal transition. The mean square displacement, temporal
autocorrelation function, the time dependence of the inverse participation
ratio, or the information entropy -- the so-called hallmarks of studying
localization based on dynamics -- all of them indicate such a complete turnover
in the nature of the single particle states and the character of the energy
spectrum under suitable conditions. The results shown in this work using
quasiperiodic lattices of the Fibonacci family are much more general and hold
good even for a randomly disordered arrangement of the building blocks of the
systems considered, and indicate a subtle universality class under which these
lattices can be grouped. The observations are in complete contradiction to the
usual disorder-induced localization phenomena and corroborate recent results
obtained from an analysis of the time independent Schr\"odinger equation for
similar systems.

<p>Chirality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in which a symmetry between left- and
right-handed objects is broken, examples in nature ranging from subatomic
particles and molecules to living organisms. In particle physics, the weak
force is responsible for the symmetry breaking and parity violation in beta
decay, but in condensed matter systems interactions that lead to chirality
remain poorly understood. Here, we unravel the mechanism of chiral charge
density wave formation in the transition-metal dichalcogenide 1T-TiSe2. Using
representation analysis, we show that charge density modulations and ionic
displacements, which transform as a continuous scalar field and a vector field
on a discrete lattice, respectively, follow different irreducible
representations of the space group, despite the fact that they propagate with
the same wave-vectors and are strongly coupled to each other. This
charge-lattice symmetry frustration is resolved by further breaking of all
symmetries not common to both sectors through induced lattice distortions, thus
leading to chirality. Our theory is verified using Raman spectroscopy and
inelastic x-ray scattering, which reveal that all but translation symmetries
are broken at a level not resolved by state-of-the-art diffraction techniques.

<h3>GdAlSi: An antiferromagnetic topological Weyl semimetal with  non-relativistic spin splitting</h3>

<i>Jadupati Nag, Bishal Das, Sayantika Bhowal, Yukimi Nishioka, Barnabha Bandyopadhyay, Shiv Kumar, Kenta Kuroda, Akio Kimura, K. G. Suresh, Aftab Alam</i>
<p>Spintronics has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional electronics
based technologies in the past few decades. While on one hand, the discovery of
topological phases of matter with protected spin-polarized states has opened up
exciting prospects, recent revelation of intriguing non-relativistic spin
splitting in collinear antiferromagnetic materials with unique symmetries
facilitate a wide possibility of realizing both these features simultaneously.
In this work, we report the co-existence of these two intriguing properties
within a single material: GdAlSi. It crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal
structure with a non-centrosymmetric space group $I4_{1}md$ ($109$). The
magnetization data indicates antiferromagnetic ordering with an ordering
temperature ($T_N$) 32 K. Ab-initio calculations reveal GdAlSi to be a
collinear antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal with an unconventional,
momentum-dependent spin splitting, also referred to as altermagnet.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on GdAlSi single
crystals subsequently confirm the presence of Fermi arcs, a distinctive
hallmark of Weyl semimetals. Electric and magnetic multipole analysis provides
a deeper understanding of the symmetry-mediated, momentum-dependent spin
splitting, which has strictly non-relativistic origin. To the best of our
knowledge, such co-existence of unconventional antiferromagnetic order and
non-trivial topology is unprecedented and has never been observed before in a
single material, rendering GdAlSi a special and promising candidate material.
We propose a device harnessing these features, poised to enable practical and
efficient topotronic applications.

<p>LiMn2O4 (LMO), cathodes present large stability when cycled in aqueous
electrolytes, contrasting its behavior in conventional organic electrolytes in
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this
distinctive behavior, we employ unconventional characterization techniques,
including Variable Energy Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (VEPALS),
Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and macro-Raman Spectroscopy (with
mm-size laser spot). These still rather unexplored techniques in the battery
field provide complementary information across different length scales,
revealing previously hidden features.
VEPALS offers atomic-scale insights, uncovering cationic defects and
sub-nanometer pores that tend to collapse with cycling. TERS, operating at the
nanometric range at the surface, captured the presence of Mn3O4 and its
dissolution with cycling, elucidating dynamic changes during operation.
Additionally, TERS highlights SO42- accumulation at grain boundaries.
Macro-Raman Spectroscopy focuses on the micrometer scale, depicting small
changes in the cathode's long-range order, suggesting a slow but progressive
loss of crystalline quality under operation.
Integrating these techniques provides a comprehensive assessment of LMO
cathode stability in aqueous electrolytes, offering multifaceted insights into
phase and defect evolution that can help to rationalize the origin of such
stability when compared to conventional organic electrolytes. Our findings
advance the understanding of LMO behavior in aqueous environments and provide
guidelines for its development for next-generation LIBs.

<p>The magnetic ground state of BaFe12O19 (BFO) was investigated using X-ray
absorption at 1.2 K and 1.5 K, respectively. The XMCD measurements on
single-crystals of BFO in grazing incidence geometry reveal the canting of the
spins away from the c-axis of the hexagonal unit cell. Single-crystal neutron
diffraction studies reveal magnetic satellite peaks along the 00l reciprocal
lattice row around the forbidden l = 2n +/- 1 positions confirming conical-type
magnetic structure in the ground state of BFO. The observation of the conical
magnetic structure of BFO opens the possibility of type-II multiferroicity in
undoped BFO also.

<h3>Quasiperiodic gallium adlayer on i-Al-Pd-Mn</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12005" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12005</a>
<br>
<i>Pramod Bhakuni, Marian Krajčí, Sudipta Roy Barman</i>
<p>Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction
(LEED), and density functional theory (DFT), we demonstrate the formation of
quasicrystalline gallium adlayer on icosahedral ($i$)-Al-Pd-Mn. Quasiperiodic
motifs are evident in the STM topography images, including the Ga white flower
(GaWF) and $\tau$ inflated GaWF ($\tau$-GaWF), where $\tau$ is the golden mean.
A larger and more complicated ring motif is also identified, comprised of a
bright center and an outer ring of pentagons. The fast Fourier transform of the
STM images exhibits distinct quasiperiodic spots, thereby establishing
quasiperiodicity on a length scale of $\sim$350 nm. Based on our DFT
calculations, the preferred adsorption sites of Ga on i-Al-Pd-Mn are determined
to be either the Mn atoms at the center of the Penrose P1 tile or the vertices
of the P1 tile containing Pd atoms at the center of a cluster of 5 Al atoms
(5-Al). The GaWF motif is modeled by an inner 6 atom Ga cluster (6-Ga) around
the central Mn atom and an outer ring of 5 Ga atoms adsorbed at the centers of
the 5-Al clusters, both having pentagonal symmetry. The $\tau$-GaWF motif is
modeled by the 6-Ga arranged on the $\tau$-P1 tiling, while the ring motif is
modeled by Ga atoms adsorbed at the center of 5-Al clusters above a Pd atom.
The side lengths and diameters of the GaWF, $\tau$-GaWF, and the ring motifs
are $\tau$ scaled and show excellent agreement with the DFT-based models. An
additional indication of the quasiperiodic characteristics of the Ga monolayer
is the 5-fold LEED patterns that were detected throughout the entire range of
beam energy that was measured.

<h3>Random exchange dynamics with bounds: H-theorem and negative temperature</h3>

<br>
<i>Dario Lucente, Marco Baldovin, Andrea Puglisi, Angelo Vulpiani</i>
<p>Random exchange kinetic models are widely employed to describe the
conservative dynamics of large interacting systems. Due to their simplicity and
generality, they are quite popular in several fields, from statistical
mechanics to biophysics and economics. Here we study a version where bounds on
the individual shares of the globally conserved quantity are introduced. We
analytically show that this dynamics allows stationary states with population
inversion, described by Boltzmann statistics at negative absolute temperature.
Their genuine equilibrium nature is verified by checking the detailed balance
condition. An H-theorem is proven: the Boltzmann entropy monotonically
increases during the dynamics. Finally, we provide analytical and numerical
evidence that a large intruder in contact with the system thermalizes,
suggesting a practical way to design a thermal bath at negative temperature.
These results open new research perspectives, creating a bridge between
negative temperature statistical descriptions and kinetic models with bounds.

<h3>Reaction-driven Diffusiophoresis of Liquid Condensates: Mechanisms for  Intra-cellular Organization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12018</a>
<br>
<i>Gregor Häfner, Marcus Müller</i>
<p>The cellular environment, characterized by its intricate composition and
spatial organization, hosts a variety of organelles, ranging from
membrane-bound ones to membraneless structures that are formed through
liquid-liquid phase separation. Cells show precise control over the position of
such condensates. We demonstrate that organelle movement in external
concentration gradients, diffusiophoresis, is distinct from the one of colloids
because fluxes can remain finite inside the liquid-phase droplets and movement
of the latter arises from incompressibility. Within cellular domains
diffusiophoresis naturally arises from biochemical reactions that are driven by
a chemical fuel and produce waste. Simulations and analytical arguments within
a minimal model of reaction-driven phase separation reveal that the directed
movement stems from two contributions: Fuel and waste are refilled or extracted
locally, resulting in concentration gradients, which (i) induce product fluxes
via incompressibility and (ii) result in an asymmetric forward reaction in the
droplet's surroundings (as well as asymmetric backward reaction inside the
droplet), thereby shifting the droplet's position. We show that the former
contribution dominates and sets the direction of the movement, away from or
towards fuel source and waste sink, depending on the product molecules'
affinity towards fuel and waste, respectively. The mechanism thus provides a
simple means to organize condensates with different composition. Particle-based
simulations and systems with more complex reaction cycles corroborate the
robustness and universality of this mechanism.

<h3>Calibration and surrogate model-based sensitivity analysis of crystal  plasticity finite element models</h3>

<br>
<i>Hugh Dorward, David M. Knowles, Eralp Demir, Mahmoud Mostafavi, Matthew J. Peel</i>
<p>Crystal plasticity models are a powerful tool for predicting the deformation
behaviour of polycrystalline materials accounting for the underlying grain
morphology and texture. These models typically have a large number of
parameters, an understanding of which is required to effectively calibrate and
apply the model. This study presents a structured framework for the global
sensitivity analysis, using Sobol indices, of the effect of crystal plasticity
parameters on model outputs. Due to the computational cost of evaluating the
crystal plasticity model multiple times within a finite element framework, a
Gaussian process regression surrogate model was constructed and used to conduct
the sensitivity analysis. Influential parameters from the sensitivity analysis
were carried forward for calibration using both a local Nelder-Mead and global
differential evolution optimisation algorithm. The results show that the
surrogate based global sensitivity analysis is able to efficiently identify
influential crystal plasticity parameters and parameter combinations. With a
reduced parameter set, both the Nelder-Mead algorithm with multiple runs and
the differential evolution algorithm were able to find an optimal parameter set
which gives a close calibration of a simulated tensile curve to experimental
data. However, only the differential evolutionary algorithm was able to
reliably find the global optimum due to the presence of local minima in the
calibration objective function.

<h3>Emergence of a potential charge disproportionated insulating state in  SrCrO$_{3}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12033" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12033</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Carta, Claude Ederer</i>
<p>We use a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) to investigate the potential emergence of a
charge-disproportionated insulating phase in SrCrO$_{3}$, whereby the Cr
cations disproportionate according to $3\text{Cr}^{4+} \rightarrow
2\text{Cr}^{3+} + \text{Cr}^{6+}$ and arrange in ordered planes perpendicular
to the cubic [111] direction. We show that the charge disproportionation
couples to a structural distortion where the oxygen octahedra around the
nominal Cr$^{6+}$ sites contract, while the octahedra surrounding the Cr$^{3+}$
sites expand and distort. Our results indicate that the
charge-disproportionated phase can be stabilized for realistic values of the
Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ parameters, but this requires a scaling of the
DFT+DMFT double counting correction by at least 35%. The disproportionated
state can also be stabilized in DFT+U calculations for a specific magnetic
configuration with antiparallel magnetic moments on adjacent Cr$^{3+}$ sites
and no magnetic moment on the Cr$^{6+}$ sites. While this phase is higher in
energy than other magnetic states that can arise in SrCrO$_{3}$, the presence
of an energy minimum suggests that the charge disproportionated state
represents a metastable state of SrCrO$_{3}$.

<h3>Dynamically selected steady states and criticality in non-reciprocal  networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Carles Martorell, Rubén Calvo, Alessia Annibale, Miguel A. Muñoz</i>
<p>Diverse equilibrium systems with heterogeneous interactions lie at the edge
of stability. Such marginally stable states are dynamically selected as the
most abundant ones or as those with the largest basins of attraction. On the
other hand, systems with non-reciprocal (or asymmetric) interactions are
inherently out of equilibrium, and exhibit a rich variety of steady states,
including fixed points, limit cycles and chaotic trajectories. How are steady
states dynamically selected away from equilibrium? We address this question in
a simple neural network model, with a tunable level of non-reciprocity. Our
study reveals different types of ordered phases and it shows how
non-equilibrium steady states are selected in each phase. In the spin-glass
region, the system exhibits marginally stable behaviour for reciprocal (or
symmetric) interactions and it smoothly transitions to chaotic dynamics, as the
non-reciprocity (or asymmetry) in the couplings increases. Such region, on the
other hand, shrinks and eventually disappears when couplings become
anti-symmetric. Our results are relevant to advance the knowledge of disordered
systems beyond the paradigm of reciprocal couplings, and to develop an
interface between statistical physics of equilibrium spin-glasses and dynamical
systems theory.

<h3>Spin-dependent localization of helical edge states in a non-Hermitian  phononic crystal</h3>

<i>Junpeng Wu, Riyi Zheng, Jialuo Liang, Manzhu Ke, Jiuyang Lu, Weiyin Deng, Xueqin Huang, Zhengyou Liu</i>
<p>As a distinctive feature unique to non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian skin
effect displays fruitful exotic phenomena in one or higher dimensions,
especially when conventional topological phases are involved. Among them,
hybrid skin-topological effect is theoretically proposed recently, which
exhibits anomalous localization of topological boundary states at
lower-dimensional boundaries accompanied by extended bulk states. Here we
experimentally realize the hybrid skin-topological effect in a non-Hermitian
phononic crystal. The phononic crystal, before tuning to be non-Hermitian, is
an ideal acoustic realization of the Kane-Mele model, which hosts gapless
helical edge states at the boundaries. By introducing a staggered distribution
of loss, the spin-dependent edge modes pile up to opposite corners, leading to
a direct observation of the spin-dependent hybrid skin-topological effect. Our
work highlights the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity and opens
new routes to non-Hermitian wave manipulations.

<p>Perovskites with Bi or Pb on the A-site host a number of interesting and yet
to be understood phenomena such as negative thermal expansion in BiNiO$_3$. We
employ hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy of Ni 2$p$ core-level as well as
valence band to probe the electronic structure of BiNiO$_3$ and PbNiO$_3$. The
experimental results supported by theoretical calculations using dynamical
mean-field theory reveal essentially identical electronic structure of the Ni-O
subsystem typical of Ni$^{2+}$ charge-transfer insulators. The two materials
are distinguished by filling of the Bi(Pb)-O antibonding states in the vicinity
of the Fermi level, which is responsible for the Bi disproportionation in
BiNiO$_3$ at ambient pressure and absence of similar behavior in PbNiO$_3$. The
present experiments provide evidence for this conclusion by revealing the
presence/absence of Bi/Pb $6s$ states at the top of the valence band in the two
materials.

<i>Alessandro Campa, Shamik Gupta</i>
<p>We consider a system of globally-coupled phase-only oscillators with
distributed intrinsic frequencies and evolving in presence of distributed
Gaussian, white noise, namely, a Gaussian, white noise whose strength for every
oscillator is a specified function of its intrinsic frequency. In the absence
of noise, the model reduces to the celebrated Kuramoto model of spontaneous
synchronization. For two specific forms of the mentioned functional dependence
and for a symmetric and unimodal distribution of the intrinsic frequencies, we
unveil the rich long-time behavior that the system exhibits, which stands in
stark contrast to the case in which the noise strength is the same for all the
oscillators. Namely, in the studied dynamics, the system may exist in either a
synchronized or an incoherent or a time-periodic state; interestingly, all of
these states also appear as long-time solutions of the Kuramoto dynamics for
the case of bimodal frequency distributions, but in the absence of any noise in
the dynamics.

<h3>Ensemble equivalence and asymptotic equipartition property in  information theory</h3>

<br>
<i>Meizhu Li, Qi Zhang</i>
<p>There is a consensus in science that information theory and statistical
physics have a close relationship but the literary proofs of the equivalence
between most of the conceptions in the two disciplines are still missing. In
this work, according to the statistical ensembles' description of the
information sequences that are generated by the i.i.d. single variable and
multivariate information source, the relationship between the ensemble
equivalence and asymptotic equipartition property is established. We find that
the description of information sequences in classical information theory is a
special case of the canonical ensemble description of information sequences.
They are both the maximum entropy approximation of the real signal generation.
Vice versa, the conjugate microcanonical ensemble description of the
information sequences under hard constraints satisfies the condition in real
signal generation exactly. Thus, the microcanoincal ensemble description is
closer to the real signal generation than the conjugate canonical ensemble, but
the ensemble equivalence between the microcanonical and canonical ensemble in
the thermodynamic limit guarantees the effectiveness of classical information
theory, i.e., the asymptotic equipartition property in information theory is an
isotope of ensemble equivalence from statistical physics.

<br>
<i>Vincent Noculak, Johannes Reuther</i>
<p>The pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group is generalized to treat
spin Hamiltonians with finite magnetic fields, enabling its application to
arbitrary spin lattice models with linear and bilinear terms in the spin
operators. We discuss in detail an efficient numerical implementation of this
approach making use of the system's symmetries. Particularly, we demonstrate
that the inclusion of small symmetry breaking magnetic seed fields regularizes
divergences of the susceptibility at magnetic phase transitions. This allows
the investigation of spin models within magnetically ordered phases at $T=0$ in
the physical limit of vanishing renormalization group parameter $\Lambda$. We
explore the capabilities and limitations of this method extension for
Heisenberg models on the square, honeycomb and triangular lattices. While the
zero-field magnetizations of these systems are systematically overestimated,
the types of magnetic orders are correctly captured, even if the local
orientations of the seed field are chosen differently than the spin
orientations of the realized magnetic order. Furthermore, the magnetization
curve of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet shows good agreement
with error controlled methods. In the future, the inclusion of magnetic fields
in the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group, which is also possible
in three dimensional spin systems, will enable a variety of additional
interesting applications such as the investigation of magnetization plateaus.

<h3>Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems with the momentum  dependent energy shift</h3>

<br>
<i>Huan-Yu Wang, Zhen-Biao Yang, Wu-Ming Liu</i>
<p>Bulk-boundary correspondences (BBCs) remain the central topic in modern
condensed matter physics, and are gaining increasing interests with the recent
discovery of non-Hermitian skin effects. However, there still exist profound
features of BBCs that are beyond the existing framework. Here, we report the
unexpected behavior of BBC when the Hamiltonian contains term of the form
$d_0(k) I$, which serves as a momentum dependent energy shift. For Hermitian
cases, momentum dependent energy shift can force the system to be semimetal,
where topological phase transitions can take place with the upper and the lower
bands keeping untouched. The proper modified BBC should be reconstructed from
the perspective of the direct band gap. In non-Hermitian cases, skin effects
are found to be capable of coexisting with the preserved BBC, of which the
process can be greatly facilitated by the complex $d_0(k)I$. Remarkably, such
results can be led a further step and contrary to the intuitive consideration,
the modified BBC in Hermitian systems can be restored to be conventional by
including extra non-Hermiticity. The physical origin for these phenomena lies
in that $d_0(k)I$ can drastically change the point gap topology. Finally, the
corresponding experimental simulations are proposed via the platforms of
electric circuits.

<p>Zinc alloys have emerged as promising candidates for biodegradable materials
due to their remarkable biocompatibility and favorable mechanical
characteristics. The incorporation of alloying elements plays an essential role
in advancing the tensile strength of Zn alloys. Nevertheless, achieving uniform
dispersion of these elements poses challenges due to chemical segregation
during solidification. In this study, rapid solidification followed by
high-pressure torsion was successfully employed to fabricate Zn-Li-Mn-Mg-Cu
alloys characterized by ultrafine-grained microstructures with evenly
distributed nanometric intermetallic phases. A comprehensive examination,
including phase composition, microstructural evolution, tensile properties and
deformation mechanisms, was conducted. The impact of varying annealing
temperatures on microstructural stability was systematically examined. The
combined implementation of rapid solidification and high-pressure torsion
yielded alloys with an average grain size below 360 nm, thereby demonstrating
exceptional mechanical properties including yield stress (YS), ultimate tensile
strength (UTS), and elongation to failure (Ef) equal to at least 325+-6 MPa,
350+-8 MPa and 40+-11 %, respectively. Heat treatment notably augmented the
mechanical properties, resulting in a YS = 440+-11 MPa and UTS = 491+-6 MPa,
while preserving plasticity (Ef = 23+-4 %) in the Zn-0.33Li-0.27Mn-0.14Mg-0.1Cu
alloy. Nanoindentation strain rate jump tests identified thermally activated
mechanisms and grain boundary sliding as dominant deformation mechanisms.

<h3>Optical properties and exciton transfer between N-heterocyclic carbene  iridium (III) complexes for blue light-emitting diode applications from first  principles</h3>

<br>
<i>Irina V. Lebedeva, Joaquim Jornet-Somoza</i>
<p>N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) iridium (III) complexes are considered as
promising candidates for blue emitters in organic light-emitting diodes. They
can play the roles of the emitter as well as of electron and hole transporters
in the same emission layer. We investigate optical transitions in such
complexes with account of geometry and electronic structure changes upon
excitation or charging and exciton transfer between the complexes from first
principles. It is shown that excitation of NHC iridium complexes is accompanied
by a large reorganization energy $\sim$0.7 eV and a significant loss in the
oscillator strength, which should lead to low exciton diffusion. Calculations
with account of spin-orbit coupling reveal a small singlet-triplet splitting
$\sim$0.1 eV, whereas the oscillator strength for triplet excitations is found
to be an order of magnitude smaller than for the singlet ones. The
contributions of the F\"orster and Dexter mechanisms are analyzed via the
explicit integration of transition densities. It is shown that for typical
distances between emitter complexes in the emission layer, the contribution of
the Dexter mechanism should be negligible compared to the F\"orster mechanism.
On the other hand, the ideal dipole approximation, although gives the correct
order of the exciton coupling, fails to reproduce the result taking into
account spatial distribution of the transition density. For charged NHC
complexes, we find a number of optical transitions close to the emission peak
of the blue emitter with high exciton transfer rates that can be responsible
for exciton-polaron quenching. The nature of these transitions is analyzed.

calculations, based on the extended Gross- Pitaevskii equation, to characterize
the ground state of a dipolar Bose gas under the effect of a bubble trapping

observe the emergence of a wide variety of dipolar solids, which consist of
arrangements of dipolar droplets along a ring over the equator of the spherical
shell confinement. By changing the detuning of the trap, we probe different
ring-like supersolid structures with varying number of dipolar clusters, which
are unobtainable through conventional trapping settings.

<p>Embedding rare-earth pnictide (RE-V) nanoparticles into III-V semiconductors
enables unique optical, electrical, and thermal properties, with applications
in THz photoconductive switches, tunnel junctions, and thermoelectric devices.
Despite the high structural quality and control over growth, particle size, and
density, the underlying electronic structure of these nanocomposite materials
has only been hypothesized. Basic questions about the metallic or
semiconducting nature of the nanoparticles (that are typically < 3 nm in
diameter) have remained unanswered. Using first-principles calculations, we
investigated the structural and electronic properties of ErAs nanoparticles in
AlAs, GaAs, InAs, and their alloys. Formation energies of the ErAs
nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes (i.e., from cubic to spherical,
with 1.14 nm, 1.71 nm, and 2.28 nm diameters) show that spherical nanoparticles
are the most energetically favorable. As the diameter increases, the Fermi
level is lowered from near the conduction band to the middle of the gap. For
the lowest energy nanoparticles, the Fermi level is pinned near the mid-gap, at
about 0.8 eV above the valence band in GaAs and about 1.2 eV in AlAs, and it is
resonant in the conduction band in InAs. Our results show that the Fermi level
is pinned on an absolute energy scale once the band alignment at AlAs/GaAs/InAs
interfaces is considered, offering insights into the rational design of these
nanocomposite materials.

<i>Alexander C. Tyner, Sinéad M. Griffin, Alexander V. Balatsky</i>
<p>Recent reports of room-temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity in
copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite, commonly referred to as LK99, have
prompted numerous theoretical and experimental studies into its properties. As
the electron-phonon interaction is a common mechanism for superconductivity,
the electron-phonon coupling strength is an important quantity to compute for
LK99. In this work, we compare the electron-phonon coupling strength among the
proposed compositions of LK99. The results of our study are in alignment with
the conclusion that LK99 is not a likely candidate for room-temperature
superconductivity if electron-phonon interaction is to serve as the mechanism.

<h3>Microscopic theory of current-induced skyrmion transport and its  application in disordered spin textures</h3>

<p>Magnetic skyrmions hold great promise for realizing compact and stable memory
devices that can be manipulated at very low energy costs via electronic current
densities. In this work, we extend a recently introduced method to describe
classical skyrmion textures coupled to dynamical itinerant electrons. In this
scheme, the electron dynamics is described via nonequilibrium Green's functions
(NEGF) within the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz, and the classical spins are
treated via the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The framework is here
extended to open systems, by the introduction of a non-interacting
approximation to the collision integral of NEGF. This, in turn, allows us to
perform computations of the real-time response of skyrmions to electronic
currents in large quantum systems coupled to electronic reservoirs, which
exhibit a linear scaling in the number of time steps. We use this approach to
investigate how electronic spin currents and dilute spin disorder affects
skyrmion transport and the skyrmion Hall drift. Our results show that the
skyrmion dynamics is sensitive to the specific form of spin disorder, such that
different disorder configurations leads to qualitatively different skyrmion
trajectories for the same applied bias. This sensitivity arises from the local
spin dynamics around the magnetic impurities, a feature that is expected not to
be well captured by phenomenological or spin-only descriptions. At the same
time, our findings illustrate the potential of engineering microscopic impurity
patterns to steer skyrmion trajectories.

<h3>On the role of Grain Boundary Character in the Stress Corrosion Cracking  of Nanoporous Gold Thin Films</h3>

<p>For its potential as a catalyst, nanoporous gold (NPG) prepared through
dealloying of bulk Ag-Au alloys has been extensively investigated. NPG thin
films can offer ease of handling, better tunability of the chemistry and
microstructure of the nanoporous structure, and represent a more sustainable
usage of scarce resources. These films are however prone to intergranular
cracking during dealloying, limiting their stability and potential
applications. Here, we set out to systematically investigate the grain
boundaries in Au28Ag72 thin films. We observe that a sample synthesized at 400
{\deg}C is at least 2.5 times less prone to cracking compared to a sample
synthesized at room temperature. This correlates with a higher density of
coincident site lattice grain boundaries, especially the density of coherent
sigma 3, increased, which appear resistant against cracking. Nanoscale
compositional analysis of random high-angle grain boundaries reveals prominent
Ag enrichment up to 77 at.%, whereas sigma 3 coherent twin boundaries show Au
enrichment of up to 30 at.%. The misorientation and the chemistry of grain
boundaries hence affect their dealloying behavior, which in turn controls the
cracking, and the possible longevity of NPG thin films for application in
electrocatalysis.

<h3>The pseudochiral Fermi surface of $α$-RuI$_3$</h3>

<p>In continuation of research into RuCl$_3$ and RuBr$_3$ as potential quantum
spin liquids, a phase with unique magnetic order characterised by long-range
quantum entanglement and fractionalised excitations, the compound RuI$_3$ has
been recently synthesised. Here, we show RuI$_3$ is a moderately correlated
metal with two bands crossing the Fermi level, implying the absence of any
quantum spin liquids phase. We find that the Fermi surface as measured or
calculated for a 2D ($k_\text{x},k_\text{y}$) slice at any $k_\text{z}$ lacks
mirror symmetry, i.e. is pseudochiral. We link this phenomenon to the ABC
stacking in the R$\bar{3}$ space group of $\alpha$-RuI$_3$, which is achiral
but lacks any mirror or glide symmetries. We further provide a formal framework
for understanding when such a pseudochiral electronic structure may be
observed.

<h3>Unlearnable Games and "Satisficing'' Decisions: A Simple Model for a  Complex World</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12252" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12252</a>
<br>
<i>Jerome Garnier-Brun, Michael Benzaquen, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud</i>
<p>As a schematic model of the complexity economic agents are confronted with,
we introduce the ``SK-game'', a discrete time binary choice model inspired from
mean-field spin-glasses. We show that even in a completely static environment,
agents are unable to learn collectively-optimal strategies. This is either
because the learning process gets trapped in a sub-optimal fixed point, or
because learning never converges and leads to a never ending evolution of
agents intentions. Contrarily to the hope that learning might save the standard
``rational expectation'' framework in economics, we argue that complex
situations are generically unlearnable and agents must do with satisficing
solutions, as argued long ago by Herbert Simon (Simon 1955). Only a
centralized, omniscient agent endowed with enormous computing power could
qualify to determine the optimal strategy of all agents. Using a mix of
analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we find that (i) long memory of
past rewards is beneficial to learning whereas over-reaction to recent past is
detrimental and leads to cycles or chaos; (ii) increased competition
destabilizes fixed points and leads first to chaos and, in the high competition
limit, to quasi-cycles; (iii) some amount of randomness in the learning
process, perhaps paradoxically, allows the system to reach better collective
decisions; (iv) non-stationary, ``aging'' behaviour spontaneously emerge in a
large swath of parameter space of our complex but static world. On the positive
side, we find that the learning process allows cooperative systems to
coordinate around satisficing solutions with rather high (but markedly
sub-optimal) average reward. However, hyper-sensitivity to the game parameters
makes it impossible to predict ex ante who will be better or worse off in our
stylized economy.

<h3>Instability cascades in disordered systems indicate record dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12254</a>
<br>
<i>Stefan Boettcher, Paula A. Gago</i>
<p>In Shohat et al. [1], the authors present a study of the aging dynamics for
crumpling sheets of mylar after a constant load is applied. Those experiments
are modeled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a network of randomly
bistable elements. While such a specific model may well account for the
microscopic origins of the aging phenomenology in a large class of disordered
systems, we note that the observed temporal behavior is far more universal [2,
3, 4]. We show here that it is but another example of a system generically
exhibiting a statistic of records (i.e., record dynamics) that can be analyzed
as a log-Poisson process [5], an effective means to discriminate between models
[6]. To this end, we can defer to the keen observations by the authors as well
as employ the LAMMPS [7] script they have provided.

<h3>Quench dynamics in higher-dimensional Holstein models: Insights from  Truncated Wigner Approaches</h3>

<br>

<p>Charge-density wave phases in quantum materials stem from the complex
interplay of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Nowadays, various
time-resolved spectroscopy techniques allow to actively manipulate such phases
and monitor their dynamics in real time. Modeling such nonequilibrium dynamics
theoretically is a great challenge and exact methods can usually only treat a
small number of atoms and finitely many phonons. We approach the melting of
charge-density waves in a Holstein model after a sudden switch-on of the
electronic hopping from two perspectives: We prove that in the non-interacting
and in the strong-coupling limit, the CDW order parameter on high-dimensional
hypercubic lattices obeys a factorization relation for long times, such that
its dynamics can be reduced to the one-dimensional case. Secondly, we present
numerical results from semiclassical techniques based on the Truncated Wigner
Approximation for two spatial dimensions. A comparison with exact data obtained
for a Holstein chain shows that a semiclassical treatment of both the electrons
and phonons is required in order to correctly describe the phononic dynamics.
This is confirmed, in addition, for a quench in the electron-phonon coupling
strength.

<h3>Vortex nucleation processes in rotating lattices of Bose-Einstein  condensates ruled by the on-site phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12297" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12297</a>
<br>
<i>D. M. Jezek, P. Capuzzi</i>
<p>We study the nucleation and dynamics of vortices in rotating lattice
potentials where weakly linked condensates are formed with each condensate
exhibiting an almost axial symmetry. Due to such a symmetry, the on-site phases
acquire a linear dependence on the coordinates as a result of the rotation,
which allows us to predict the position of vortices along the low density paths
that separate the sites. We first show that, for a system of atoms loaded in a
four-site square lattice potential, subject to a constant rotation frequency,
the analytical expression that we obtain for the positions of vortices of the
stationary arrays accurately reproduces the full three-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii results. We then study the time-dependent vortex nucleation
process when a linear ramp of the rotation frequency is applied to a lattice
with sixteen sites. We develop a formula for the number of nucleated vortices
which turns to have a linear dependence on the rotation frequency with a
smaller slope than that of the standard estimate which is valid in absence of
the lattice. From time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii simulations we further find
that the on-site populations remain almost constant during the time evolution
instead of spreading outwards, as expected from the action of the centrifugal
force. Therefore, the time-dependent phase difference between neighboring sites
acquires a running behavior typical of a self-trapping regime. We finally show
that, in accordance with our predictions, this fast phase-difference evolution
provokes a rapid vortex motion inside the lattice. Our analytical expressions
may be useful for describing other vortex processes in systems with the same
on-site axial symmetry.

<h3>Electrical Activity of Topological Chiral Edge Magnons</h3>

<br>
<i>Robin R. Neumann, Jürgen Henk, Ingrid Mertig, Alexander Mook</i>
<p>Topological magnon insulators support chiral edge excitations, whose lack of
electric charge makes them notoriously difficult to detect experimentally. We
show that relativistic magnetoelectric coupling universally renders chiral edge
magnons electrically active, thereby facilitating electrical probes of magnon
topology. Considering a two-dimensional out-of-plane magnetized topological
magnon insulator, we predict a fluctuation-activated electric polarization
perpendicular to the sample edges. Furthermore, the chiral topological
electromagnons give rise to a unique in-gap signal in electrical absorption
experiments. These results suggest THz spectroscopy as a promising probe for
topological magnons.

<h3>Energy levels of gapped graphene quantum dots in external fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12324</a>
<br>
<i>Ahmed Bouhlal, Mohammed El Azar, Ahmed Siari, Ahmed Jellal</i>
<p>We investigate the energy levels of fermions within a circular graphene
quantum dot (GQD) subjected to external magnetic and Aharonov-Bohm fields.
Solving the eigenvalue equation for two distinct regions allows us to determine
the eigenspinors for the valleys $K$ and $K^\prime$. By establishing the
continuity of eigenspinors at the GQD interface, we derive an equation that
reveals the reliance of energy levels on external physical parameters. Our
observations suggest that the symmetry of energy levels hinges on the selected
physical parameters. We observe that at low magnetic fields, the energy levels
display degeneracy, which diminishes as the field strength increases,
coinciding with the convergence of energy levels toward the Landau levels. We
illustrate that the introduction of a magnetic flux into the GQD leads to the
creation of an energy gap, extending the trapping time of electrons without
perturbing the system. Conversely, the addition of gap energy widens the band
gap, disrupting the system's symmetry by introducing new energy levels.

<h3>Thermal rectification with topological edge states</h3>

<br>
<i>Abdulla Alseiari, Michael Hilke</i>
<p>Thermal rectification devices can be important for various thermal management
applications. For oscillator chains, thermal rectification was observed when
masses are distributed non-uniformly. Leaning on the importance of topological
materials, we consider here a simple vibrational topological system, the binary
isotope superlattice (BISL). We show that the BISL can be mapped exactly onto
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which has different topological phases,
including topological edge sates. For the case, where there is a single
topological edge state, we show that the BISL exhibits thermal rectification in
the presence of a small nonlinear term. Thermal transport is computed using
temperature reservoirs connected to both extremities. These results have
implications for other classes of topological phonon systems.

<h3>Nanocrystal Programmable Assembly Beyond Hard Spheres (or Shapes) and  Other (Simple) Potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12421" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12421</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Travesset</i>
<p>Ligands are the key to almost any strategy in the assembly of programmable
nanocrystals (or nanoparticles) and must be accurately considered in any
predictive model. Hard Spheres (or Shapes) provide the simplest and yet quite
successful approach to assembly, with remarkable sophisticated predictions
verified in experiments. There are, however, many situations where hard
spheres/shapes predictions fail. This prompts three important questions: {\em
In what situations should hard spheres/shapes models be expected to work?} and
when they do not work, {\em Is there a general model that successfully corrects
hard sphere/shape predictions?} and given other successful models where ligands
are included explicitly, and of course, numerical simulations, {\em can we
unify hard sphere/shape models, explicit ligand models and all atom
simulations?}. The Orbifold Topological Model (OTM) provides a positive answer
to these three questions. In this paper, I give a detailed review of OTM,
describing the concept of ligand vortices and how it leads to spontaneous
valence and nanoparticle ``eigenshapes'' while providing a prediction of the
lattice structure, without fitting parameters, which accounts for many body
effects not captured in (two-body) potentials. I present a thorough survey of
experiments and simulations and show that, to this date, they are in full
agreement with the OTM predictions. I will conclude with a discussion on
whether NC superlattices are equilibrium structures and some significant
challenges in structure prediction.

<h3>Orisometry formalism reveals duality and exotic nonuniform response in  origami sheets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12432</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Czajkowski, James McInerney, Andrew M. Wu, D. Zeb Rocklin</i>
<p>Origami metamaterial design enables drastic qualitative changes in the
response properties of a thin sheet via the addition of a repeating pattern of
folds based around a rigid folding motion. Known also as a mechanism, this
folding motion will have a very small energy cost when applied uniformly; and
yet uniform activation of such remains highly difficult to observe, these
sheets instead generically displaying nonuniform response patterns which are
not yet well understood. Here, we present a purely geometric continuum theory
which captures the nonuniform, nonlinear response to generic loading as
composed locally of the planar mechanism, as well as previously identified
``twist'' and ``bend'' modes which enable the patterned sheet to curve out of
the plane across long distances. Our numerical analysis confirms that these
three modes govern the observed nonuniform response, varying smoothly across
the sheet according to three PDEs which guarantee compatibility. In analogy
with the recently solved case of planar mechanism metamaterials, these
``Orisometries'' (origami + isometries, so named by us) are subextensive but
infinite in number, with each mode displaying, in the linear limit, ``sheared
analytic'' spatial patterns which are controlled by the Poisson's ratio of the
uniform folding mechanism. Furthermore, the ``planar'' mechanism-based
deformation patterns superimpose with a mathematically dual space of
``non-planar'' twist/bend deformations to span the available soft linear
response. Together, our findings furnish the first quantification of the number
of soft response modes available, as well as the first intuitive quantification
of their spatial distribution.
