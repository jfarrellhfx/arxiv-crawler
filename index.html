<h3>Geometric housekeeping--excess decomposition for hydrodynamic systems</h3>

We study a connection between classical hydrodynamics described
deterministically by the Navier--Stokes equation and stochastic (and chemical)
thermodynamics. In particular, we show that the minimum dissipation of a
hydrodynamic system formulated by Helmholtz in 1868 can be seen as the
housekeeping entropy production in the sense of the geometric decomposition
(also known as Maes--Neto\v{c}n\'{y} decomposition) of entropy production that
has been formulated in stochastic and chemical thermodynamics. We generalize
the decomposition for hydrodynamic systems by identifying a conservative
subspace suitable for them. The housekeeping entropy production evaluates how
the boundary affects dissipation, while the excess one quantifies the system's
nonstationarity in the sense of the material derivative. We discuss a
universality of excess entropy production rate that it may not vanish in a
steady state or yield an additional term when inertia is not negligible,
regardless of the details of the system.

<h3>Orbital effect on intrinsic superconducting diode effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19317" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19317</a>
<br>

Much ink has recently been spilled on nonreciprocal phenomena in
superconductors, especially the superconducting diode effect (SDE)
characterized by the nonreciprocity of the critical current $\Delta J_c$.
Contrary to the fundamental and practical significance of the SDE, the precise
underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the impact
of an orbital effect on the intrinsic SDE in a bilayer superconductor with
Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field. We show that a small
orbital effect leads to the sign reversal of $\Delta J_c$ and a crossover of
the helical superconducting state at a lower magnetic field than the monolayer
superconductor. On the other hand, a large orbital effect induces a decoupling
transition, stabilizing a finite momentum Cooper pairing state called the
orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, and results in the drastic
change of the SDE. Owing to the orbital effect, the field dependence of the SDE
may show oscillations several times. The results shed light on the mechanism of
the SDE in atomically-thin multilayer superconductors.

<h3>Topologically-constrained fluctuations and thermodynamics regulate  nonequilibrium response</h3>

Limits on a system's response to external perturbations inform our
understanding of how physical properties can be shaped by microscopic
characteristics. Here, we derive constraints on the steady-state nonequilibrium
response of physical observables in terms of the topology of the microscopic
state space and the strength of thermodynamic driving. Notably, evaluation of
these limits requires no kinetic information beyond the state-space structure.
When applied to models of receptor binding, we find that sensitivity is bounded
by the steepness of a Hill function with a Hill coefficient enhanced by the
chemical driving beyond the structural equilibrium limit.

<h3>A unified quasiparticle approach to the theory of strongly correlated  electron liquids</h3>

Landau's quasiparticle formalism is generalized to describe a wide class of
strongly correlated Fermi systems, in addition to conventional Fermi liquids.
This class includes (i) so-called marginal exemplars and (ii) systems that
harbor interaction-driven flat bands, in both of which manifestations of
non-Fermi-liquid behavior are well documented. Specifically, the advent of such
flat bands is attributed to a spontaneous topological rearrangement of the
Landau state that supplements the conventional Landau quasiparticle picture
with a different set of quasiparticles, the so-called fermion condensate, whose
single-particle spectrum is dispersionless. The celebrated Landau-Luttinger
theorem can then be extended to marginal Fermi liquids, in which the density of
the augmented quasiparticle system is shown to coincide with the particle
density. Moreover, the total density of systems hosting interaction-driven flat
bands is shown to be the sum of the densities of the two quasiparticle
subsystems: the Landau-like component and the fermion condensate. It is
demonstrated that the formalism thus introduced serves to clarify the non-BCS
nature of exotic superconductivity.

<h3>Bloch Oscillations, Landau-Zener Transition, and Topological Phase  Evolution in a Pendula Array</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19387" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19387</a>

<br>
<br>
We experimentally and theoretically study the dynamics of a one-dimensional
array of pendula with a mild spatial gradient in their self-frequency and where
neighboring pendula are connected with weak and alternating coupling. We map
their dynamics to the topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model of charged
quantum particles on a lattice with alternating hopping rates in an external
electric field. By directly tracking the dynamics of a wavepacket in the bulk
of the lattice, we observe Bloch oscillations, Landau-Zener transitions, and
coupling between the isospin (i.e. the inner wave function distribution within
the unit cell) and the spatial degrees of freedom (the distribution between
unit cells). We then use Bloch oscillations in the bulk to directly measure the
non-trivial global topological phase winding and local geometric phase of the
band. We measure an overall evolution of 3.1 $\pm$ 0.2 radians for the
geometrical phase during the Bloch period, consistent with the expected Zak
phase of $\pi$. Our results demonstrate the power of classical analogs of
quantum models to directly observe the topological properties of the band
structure, and sheds light on the similarities and the differences between
quantum and classical topological effects.

<h3>Engineering the directionality of hot carrier tunneling in plasmonic  tunneling structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19405" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19405</a>
<br>

Tunneling metal-insulator-metal (MIM) junctions can exhibit an open-circuit
photovoltage (OCPV) response under illumination that may be useful for
photodetection. One mechanism for photovoltage generation is hot carrier
tunneling, in which photoexcited carriers generate a net photocurrent that must
be balanced by a drift current in the open-circuit configuration. We present
experiments in electromigrated planar MIM structures, designed with asymmetric
plasmonic properties using Au and Pt electrodes. Decay of optically excited
local plasmonic modes preferentially creates hot carriers on the Au side of the
junction, leading to a clear preferred directionality of the hot electron
photocurrent and hence a preferred polarity of the resulting OCPV. In contrast,
in an ensemble of symmetric devices constructed from only one Au, polarity of
the OCPV has no preferred direction.

<h3>Is the Beer-Lambert law in $β$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ applicable? Spectral  and polarization dependent absorption and photoresponsivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19431" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19431</a>
<br>
<i>Md Mohsinur Rahman Adnan, Darpan Verma, Chris Sturm, Roberto C. Myers</i>
<br>
<br>
Due to its low symmetry, $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ exhibits a strongly
anisotropic optical response. As a result, the absorption spectra changes with
the polarization state of the incoming photons. To understand this phenomenon,
here we calculate the complete electromagnetic wave equation solutions as a
function of linear polarization angle and photon energy for
$\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ using its measured complex dielectric function tensor.
The significant off-diagonal terms in this tensor result in a non-exponential
decay in the photon flux, indicating that the Beer-Lambert law is not generally
valid in this anisotropic material. However, over a limited spectral range (>
5.8 eV (001 plane),>5.2 eV (010 plane)) an effective absorption coefficient
well approximates the photon flux decay with depth. Near the optical absorption
edge (4.9 - 5.8 eV (001 plane),4.65 - 5.2 eV (010 plane)) the photon flux decay
exhibits a modified exponential decay, such that two effective absorption
coefficients are necessary to model the optical spectrum. Using these results,
we calculate the polarization-dependent photoresponsivity spectra for light
polarized along different crystallographic directions and find that a
significant sub-bandgap photoresponse occurs spanning into the solar spectrum.
Truly solar-blind photoresponsivity is only possible if the light is linear
polarized along the [010] direction as compared to (010) plane of
$\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$.

<h3>Hafnia HfO$_2$ as a Proper Ferroelectric</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19446" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19446</a>
<br>
<i>Aldo Raeliarijaona, R. E. Cohen</i>
<br>
<br>
We clarify the nature of hafnia as a proper ferroelectric and show that there
is a shallow double well involving a single soft polar mode as in well-known
classic ferroelectrics. Using symmetry analysis, density-functional theory
(DFT) structural optimizations with and without epitaxial strain, and density
functional perturbation theory (DFPT), we examine several important possible
hafnia structures derived ultimately from the cubic fluorite structure,
including baddeleyite (P$2_{1}/c$), tetragonal antiferroelectric P4$_2$nmc,
Pbca (nonpolar and brookite), and ferroelectric rhombohedral ($R3m$),
Pmn2$_{1}$ and Pca2$_{1}$ structures. The latter is considered to be the most
likely ferroelectric phase seen experimentally, and has an antiferroelectric
parent with space group Pbcn, with a single unstable polar mode and a shallow
double well with a well depth of 24 meV/atom. Strain is not required for
switching or other ferroelectric properties, nor is coupling of the soft-mode
with any other modes within the ferroelectric Pca2$_{1}$ phase.

<h3>Machine learning a time-local fluctuation theorem for nonequilibrium  steady states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19457" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19457</a>
<br>
<i>Stephen Sanderson, Charlotte F. Petersen, Debra J. Searles</i>
<br>
<br>
Fluctuation theorems (FTs) quantify the thermodynamic reversibility of a
system, and for deterministic systems they are defined in terms of the
dissipation function. However, in a nonequilibrium steady state of
deterministic dynamics, the phase space distribution is unknown, making the
dissipation function difficult to evaluate without extra information. As such,
steady state FTs for deterministic systems to date have required either that
the trajectory segment of interest is relatively long, or that information is
available about the entire trajectory surrounding that segment. In this work,
it is shown that a simple machine learning model trained to predict whether a
given steady state trajectory segment is being played forward or backward in
time calculates a function that satisfies an FT and relies solely on
information within the segment of interest. The FT is satisfied even for very
short trajectory segments where the approximate relation derived from theory
breaks down, for systems far from equilibrium, and for various nonequilibrium
dynamics. It is further demonstrated that any function that is a
well-calibrated predictor of time's arrow must satisfy a fluctuation theorem,
and that a local FT can be derived which depends only on local dissipation and
its correlations with the surrounding non-local dissipation.

<h3>Variations of the Kibble-Zurek scaling exponents of trapped Bose gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19483</a>
<br>
<i>Tenzin Rabga, Yangheon Lee, Dalmin Bae, Myeonghyeon Kim, Yong-il Shin</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the vortex nucleation dynamics in inhomogeneous atomic Bose gases
quenched into a superfluid phase and investigate the dependence of the
Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling exponent on the underlying trap configuration. For
samples in a number of different inhomogeneous traps, we observe the
characteristic power-law scaling of the vortex number with the thermal quench
rate, as well as an enhanced vortex suppression in the outer regions with lower
particle density, in agreement with the causality effect as encapsulated in the
inhomogeneous Kibble-Zurek mechanism (IKZM). However, the measured KZ scaling
exponents show significant differences from the theoretical estimates and
furthermore, their trend as a function of the underlying trap configuration
deviate from the IKZM prediction. We also investigate the early-time coarsening
effect using a two-step quench protocol as proposed in a recent study and show
that the interpretation of the measurement results without including the
causality effect might be misleading. This work provides a comprehensive study
of vortex formation dynamics in quenched Bose gases confined in inhomogeneous
trapping potentials and calls for a refined theoretical framework for
quantitative understanding of the phase transition and defect formation
processes in such inhomogeneous systems.

<h3>Epidemic extinction in a simplicial susceptible-infected-susceptible  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19488" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19488</a>
<br>
<i>Yingshan Guo, Chuansheng Shen, Hanshuang Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the extinction of epidemics in a simplicial
susceptible-infected-susceptible model, where each susceptible individual
becomes infected either by two-body interactions ($S+I \to 2I$) with a rate
$\beta$ or by three-body interactions ($S+2I \to 3I$) with a rate $\beta
(1+\delta)$, and each infected individual spontaneously recovers ($I \to S$)
with a rate $\mu$. We focus on the case $\delta>0$ that embodies a synergistic
reinforcement effect in the group interactions. By employing the
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation for the master equation, the problem is
reduced to finding the zero-energy trajectories in an effective Hamiltonian
system. We reveal two different scenarios for optimal path to extinction, and
derive the associated action $\mathcal{S}$ for $\beta_b<\beta<\beta_c$ and for
$\beta>\beta_c$, where $\beta_b=4 (1+\delta)/(2+\delta)^2$ and $\beta_c=1$. The
action $\mathcal{S}$ shows different scaling laws near $\beta_b$ and $\beta_c$,
characterized by two different exponents: 3/2 and 1. Interestingly, the
second-order derivative of $\mathcal{S}$ with respect to $\beta$ is
discontinuous at $\beta=\beta_c$, while $\mathcal{S}$ and its first-order
derivative are both continuous, reminiscent of the second-order phase
transitions in equilibrium systems. Finally, a rare-event simulation method is
used to compute the mean extinction time, which depends exponentially on
$\mathcal{S}$ and the size $N$ of the population. The simulations results are
in well agreement with the proposed theory.

<h3>Uncommon 2D Diamond-like Carbon Nanodots Derived from Nanotubes: Atomic  Structure, Electronic States and Photonic Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19506</a>
<br>
<i>D.W. Boukhvalov, D.A. Zatsepin, Yu.A. Kuznetsova, V.I. Pryakhina, A.F. Zatsepin</i>
<br>
<br>
In this article, we report the results of relatively facile fabrication of
carbon nanodots from single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT and
MWCNT). The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman
measurements show that the obtained carbon nanodots are quasi-two-dimensional
objects with a diamond-like structure. Based on the characterization results, a
theoretical model of synthesized carbon nanodots was developed. The measured
absorption spectra demonstrate the similarity of the local atomic structure of
carbon nanodots synthesized from single-walled and multi-walled carbon
nanotubes. However, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of nanodots synthesized
from both sources turned out to be completely different. Carbon dots fabricated
from MWCNTs exhibit PL spectra similar to nanoscale carbon systems with sp3
hybridization and a valuable edge contribution. At the same time nanodots
synthesized from SWCNTs exhibit PL spectra which are typical for quantum dots
with an estimated size of ~0.6-1.3 nm.

<h3>Deep learning inter-atomic potential for irradiation damage in 3C-SiC</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19516" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19516</a>
<br>
<i>Yong Liu, Hao Wang, Linxin Guo, Zhanfeng Yan, Jian Zheng, Wei Zhou, Jianming Xue</i>
<br>
<br>
We developed and validated an accurate inter-atomic potential for molecular
dynamics simulation in cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) using a deep learning
framework combined with smooth Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) screened nuclear
repulsion potential interpolation. Comparisons of multiple important properties
were made between the deep-learning potential and existing analytical
potentials which are most commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations of
3C-SiC. Not only for equilibrium properties but also for significant properties
of radiation damage such as defect formation energies and threshold
displacement energies, our deep-learning potential gave closer predictions to
DFT criterion than analytical potentials. The deep-learning potential framework
solved the long-standing dilemma that traditional empirical potentials
currently applied in 3C-SiC radiation damage simulations gave large disparities
with each other and were inconsistent with ab-initio calculations. A more
realistic depiction of the primary irradiation damage process in 3C-SiC can be
given and the accuracy of classical molecular dynamics simulation for cubic
silicon carbide can be expected to the level of quantum mechanics.

<h3>Covariant description of the colloidal dynamics on curved manifolds</h3>

Brownian motion is a universal characteristic of colloidal particles embedded
in a host medium, and it is the fingerprint of molecular transport or
diffusion, a generic feature of relevance not only in Physics but also in
several branches of Science and Engineering. Since its discovery, Brownian
motion or colloid dynamics has been important in elucidating the connection
between the molecular details of the diffusing macromolecule and the
macroscopic information of the host medium. However, colloid dynamics is far
from being completely understood. For example, the diffusion of non-spherical
colloids and the effects of geometry on the dynamics of either passive or
active colloids are a few representative cases that are part of the current
challenges in Soft Matter Physics. In this contribution, we take a step forward
to introduce a covariant description of the colloid dynamics in curved spaces.
This formalism will allow us to understand several phenomena, for instance, the
effects of curvature on the kinetics during spinodal decomposition and the
thermodynamic properties of the colloidal dispersion, just to mention a few
examples. This theoretical framework will also serve as the starting point to
highlight the role of geometry on colloid dynamics, an aspect that is of
paramount importance to understanding more complex phenomena, such as the
diffusive mechanisms of proteins embedded in cell membranes.

In this study, we develop a steady state and time-dependent exciton diffusion
model including singlet and triplet excitons coupled with a modified Poisson
and drift-diffusion solver to explain the mechanism of hyper triplet-triplet
fusion (TTF) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Using this modified
simulator, we demonstrate various characteristics of OLEDs, including the J-V
curve, internal quantum efficiency, transient spectrum, and electric profile.
This solver can also be used to explain the mechanism of hyper-TTF-OLEDs and
analyze the loss from different exciton mechanisms. Furthermore, we perform
additional optimization of hyper-TTF-OLEDs that increases the internal quantum
efficiency by approximately 33% (from 29% to 40%).

<h3>Prediction of Born effective charges using neural network to study ion  migration under electric fields: applications to crystalline and amorphous  Li$_3$PO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19546</a>

<i>Koji Shimizu, Ryuji Otsuka, Masahiro Hara, Emi Minamitani, Satoshi Watanabe</i>
<br>
<br>
Understanding ionic behaviour under external electric fields is crucial to
develop electronic and energy-related devices using ion transport. In this
study, we propose a neural network (NN) model to predict the Born effective
charges of ions along an axis parallel to an applied electric field from atomic
structures. The proposed NN model is applied to Li$_3$PO$_4$ as a prototype.
The prediction error of the constructed NN model is 0.0376 $e$/atom. In
combination with an NN interatomic potential, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations are performed under a uniform electric field of 0.1 V/angstrom,
whereby an enhanced mean square displacement of Li along the electric field is
obtained, which seems physically reasonable. In addition, the external forces
along the direction perpendicular to the electric field, originating from the
off-diagonal terms of the Born effective charges, are found to have a
nonnegligible effect on Li migration. Finally, additional MD simulations are
performed to examine the Li motion in an amorphous structure. The results
reveal that Li migration occurs in various areas despite the absence of
explicitly introduced defects, which may be attributed to the susceptibility of
the Li ions in the local minima to the electric field. We expect that the
proposed NN method can be applied to any ionic material, thereby leading to
atomic-scale elucidation of ion behaviour under electric fields.

<h3>Combining first-principles modeling and symbolic regression for  designing efficient single-atom catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reaction on  Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this study, we address the significant challenge of overcoming limitations
in catalytic efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The current
linear scaling relationships hinder the optimization of electrocatalytic
performance. To tackle this issue, we investigate the potential of designing
single-atom catalysts (SACs) on Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes for electrochemical OER
using first-principles modeling simulations. By employing the Electrochemical
Step Symmetry Index (ESSI) method, we assess OER intermediates to fine-tune
activity and identify the optimal SAC for Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes. Our findings
reveal that both Ag and Cu exhibit effectiveness as single atoms for enhancing
OER activity on Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes. However, among the 21 chosen transition
metals (TMs) in this study, Cu stands out as the best catalyst for tweaking the
overpotential ($\eta_{OER}$). This is due to Cu's lowest overpotential compared
to other TMs, which makes it more favorable for OER performance. On the other
hand, Ag is closely aligned with ESSI=$\eta_{OER}$, making the tuning of its
overpotential more challenging. Furthermore, we employ symbolic regression
analysis to identify the significant factors that exhibit a correlation with
the OER overpotential. By utilizing this approach, we derive mathematical
formulas for the overpotential and identify key descriptors that affect
catalytic efficiency in electrochemical OER on Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes. This
comprehensive investigation not only sheds light on the potential of MXenes in
advanced electrocatalytic processes but also highlights the prospect of
improved activity and selectivity in OER applications.

Water is vital for life, and without it biomolecules and cells cannot
maintain their structures and functions. The remarkable properties of water
originate from its ability to form hydrogen-bonding networks and dynamics,
which the connectivity constantly alters because of the orientation rotation of
individual water molecules. Experimental investigation of the dynamics of
water, however, has proven challenging due to the strong absorption of water at
terahertz frequencies. In response, by employing a high-precision terahertz
spectrometer, we have measured and characterized the terahertz dielectric
response of water from supercooled liquid to near the boiling point to explore
the motions. The response reveals dynamic relaxation processes corresponding to
the collective orientation, single-molecule rotation, and structural
rearrangements resulting from breaking and reforming hydrogen bonds in water.
We have observed the direct relationship between the macroscopic and
microscopic relaxation dynamics of water, and the results have provided
evidence of two liquid forms in water with different transition temperatures
and thermal activation energies. The results reported here thus provide an
unprecedented opportunity to directly test microscopic computational models of
water dynamics.

<h3>Monofluorinated Ether Electrolyte with Acetal Backbone for  High-Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</h3>

High degree of fluorination for ether electrolytes has resulted in improved
cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to stable SEI formation
and good oxidative stability. However, the sluggish ion transport and
environmental concerns of high fluorination degree drives the need to develop
less fluorinated structures. Here, we introduce bis(2-fluoroethoxy)methane
(F2DEM) which features monofluorination of the acetal backbone. High coulombic
efficiency (CE) and stable long-term cycling in Li||Cu half cells can be
achieved with F2DEM even under fast Li metal plating conditions. The
performance of F2DEM is further compared with diethoxymethane (DEM) and
2-[2-(2,2-Difluoroethoxy)ethoxy]-1,1,1-Trifluoroethane (F5DEE). The structural
similarity of DEM allows us to better probe the effects of monofluorination,
while F5DEE is chosen as the one of the best performing LMB electrolytes for
reference. The monofluorine substitution provides improved oxidation stability
compared to non-fluorinated DEM, as demonstrated in the linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) and voltage holding experiments in Li||Pt and Li||Al cells.
Higher ionic conductivity compared to F5DEE is also observed due to the
decreased degree of fluorination. Furthermore, 1.75 M lithium
bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) / F2DEM displays significantly lower
overpotential compared with the two reference electrolytes, which improves
energy efficiency and enables its application in high-rate conditions.
Comparative studies of F2DEM with DEM and F5DEE in anode-free (LiFePO4) LFP
pouch cells and high-loading LFP coin cells with 20 {\mu}m excess Li further
show improved capacity retention of F2DEM electrolyte.

The control of Mott phase is intertwined with the spatial reorganization of
the electronic states. Out-of-equilibrium driving forces typically lead to
electronic patterns that are absent at equilibrium, whose nature is however
often elusive. Here, we unveil a nanoscale pattern formation in the
Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ Mott insulator. We demonstrate how an applied electric field
spatially reconstructs the insulating phase that, uniquely after switching off
the electric field, exhibits nanoscale stripe domains. The stripe pattern has
regions with inequivalent octahedral distortions that we directly observe
through high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. The
nanotexture depends on the orientation of the electric field, it is
non-volatile and rewritable. We theoretically simulate the charge and orbital
reconstruction induced by a quench dynamics of the applied electric field
providing clear-cut mechanisms for the stripe phase formation. Our results open
the path for the design of non-volatile electronics based on voltage-controlled
nanometric phases.

The negative thermal expansion (NTE) material is counterintuitive due to its
typical feature of volume contraction on heating, which can act as the
thermal-expansion compensators to counteract the normal positive thermal
expansion. A wide temperature range of NTE behavior is desired, whereas the
performance optimization by traditional doping strategy has reached its upper
limit. In this paper, the unique sluggish characteristic in high entropy
materials is proposed to broaden the NTE temperature range by relaxing the
sharp phase transition in Mn-based anti-perovskite nitride. We propose an
empirical screening method to synthesis the high-entropy anti-perovskite
(HEAP). A remarkable NTE behavior (up to {\Delta}T = 235 K, 5 K < T < 240 K)
with the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of - 4.7 ppm/K has been
observed in typical HEAP Mn3Cu0.2Zn0.2Ga0.2Ge0.2Mn0.2N, whose working
temperature range is far wider than that of traditional low-entropy doping
system. The wide temperature range of phase separation due to sluggish phase
transition is responsible for the broadened NTE behavior in HEAP. Our
demonstration provides a unique paradigm in the broadening of the NTE
temperature range for phase transition induced NTE materials through entropy
engineering.

In this study, we investigate the bulk electronic structure of Pb-substituted
LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$ single crystals, using two types of hard-x-ray
spectroscopy. High-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected x-ray absorption
spectroscopy revealed a spectral change at low temperatures. Using density
functional theory (DFT) simulations, we find that the temperature-induced
change originates from a structural phase transition, similar to the
pressure-induced transition in LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. This finding
suggests that the mechanism of bulk superconductivity induced by Pb
substitution is the same as that under high pressure. Furthermore, a novel
low-valence state with a mixture of divalent and trivalent Bi ions is
discovered using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy with the aid of DFT
calculations.

This research demonstrates that Ising machines can effectively solve optimal
elemental configuration searches in crystals, with Au-Cu alloys serving as an
example. The energy function is derived using the cluster expansion method in
the form of a QUBO function, enabling efficient problem-solving via Ising
machines. We have successfully obtained reasonable solutions for crystal
structures consisting of over 10,000 atoms. Notably, we have also obtained
plausible solutions for optimization problems with constrained solutions, such
as situations where the composition ratio of atomic species is predetermined.
These findings suggest that Ising machines can be valuable tools for addressing

DyRu2Si2 is a frustrated magnet to exhibit multiple magnetic phase transition
in zero and finite magnetic fields. We investigated and characterized the phase
transition between the partially-ordered antiferromagnetic phases at zero field
by ac susceptibility measurements. Detailed ac susceptibility measurements
reveal the novel critical dynamics of the phase transition; extremely slow
dynamics with the relaxation time in the order of 10-100 msec, speed-up of the
dynamics on cooling indicating its non-thermally activated origin and growing
of the ferromagnetic correlations towards the phase transition temperature. On
the basis of these findings, we propose the novel phase transition process,
namely, the spontaneous striped-arrangement of the precedently emergent
"belt-like" ferromagnetic spin texture.

<h3>Implementation of the SCAN Exchange-Correlation Functional with  Numerical Atomic Orbitals</h3>

<br>

Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is nowadays widely used for
electronic structure theory simulations, and the accuracy and efficiency of DFT
rely on approximations of the exchange-correlation functional. By inclusion of
the kinetic energy density $\tau$, the meta-generalized-gradient approximation
(meta-GGA) family of functionals achieves better accuracy and flexibility while
retaining the efficiency of semi-local functionals. The SCAN meta-GGA
functional has been proven to yield accurate results for solid and molecular
systems. We implement meta-GGA functionals with both numerical atomic orbitals
and plane wave basis in the ABACUS package. Apart from the exchange-correlation
potential, we also discuss the evaluation of force and stress. To validate our
implementation, we perform finite-difference tests and convergence tests with
the SCAN meta-GGA functional. We further test water hexamers, weakly
interacting molecules of the S22 dataset, as well as 13 semiconductors. The
results show satisfactory agreements with previous calculations and available
experimental values.

Semiconductor spin qubits have gained increasing attention as a possible
platform to host a fault-tolerant quantum computer. First demonstrations of
spin qubit arrays have been shown in a wide variety of semiconductor materials.
The highest performance for spin qubit logic has been realized in silicon, but
scaling silicon quantum dot arrays in two dimensions has proven to be
challenging. By taking advantage of high-quality heterostructures and carefully
designed gate patterns, we are able to form a tunnel coupled 2 $\times$ 2
quantum dot array in a Si/SiGe heterostructure. We are able to load a single
electron in all four quantum dots, thus reaching the (1,1,1,1) charge state.
Furthermore we characterise and control the tunnel coupling between all pairs
of dots by measuring polarisation lines over a wide range of barrier gate
voltages. Tunnel couplings can be tuned from about $30~\rm \mu eV$ up to
approximately $400~\rm \mu eV$. These experiments provide a first step toward
the operation of spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum dots in two dimensions.

We report on the realization of all-optical planar microlensing for
exciton-polariton condensates in semiconductor microcavities. We utilize
spatial light modulators to structure a nonresonant pumping beam into a
planoconcave lens-shape focused onto the microcavity plane. When pumped above
condensation threshold, the system effectively becomes a directional polariton
antenna, generating an intense focused beam of coherent polaritons away from
the pump region. The effects of pump intensity, which regulates the interplay
between gain and blueshift of polaritons, as well as the geometry of
lens-shaped pump are studied and a strategy to optimize the focusing of the
condensate is proposed. Our work underpins the feasibility to guide nonlinear
light in microcavities using nonresonant excitation schemes, offering
perspectives on optically reprogrammable on-chip polariton circuitry.

<br>
<br>
Despite recent intensive research on topological aspects of open quantum
systems, effects of strong interactions have not been sufficiently explored. In
this paper, we demonstrate that interactions induce the Liouvillian skin effect
by analyzing a one-dimensional correlated model with two-body loss. We show
that, in the presence of interactions, eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the
Liouvillian strongly depend on boundary conditions. Specifically, we find that
interactions induce localization of eigenmodes of the Liouvillian around the
right edge under open boundary conditions. To characterize the Liouvllian skin
effect, we define the topological invariant by using the Liouvillian
superoperator. Then, we numerically confirm that the topological invariant
captures the Liouvillian skin effect. Furthermore, the presence of the
localization of eigenmodes results in the unique dynamics observed only under
open boundary conditions: particle accumulation at the right edge in transient
dynamics. Our result paves the way to realize topological phenomena in open
quantum systems induced by strong interactions.

<br>
<br>
Very soft grain assemblies have unique shape-changing capabilities that allow
them to be compressed far beyond the rigid jammed state by filling void spaces
more effectively. However, accurately following the formation of these systems
by monitoring the creation of new contacts, the changes in grain shape, and
measuring grain-scale stresses is challenging. We developed an experimental
method overtaking these challenges and connecting their microscale behavior to
their macroscopic response. By tracking the local strain energy during
compression, we reveal a transition from granular-like to continuous-like
material. Mean contact geometry is shown to vary linearly with the packing
fraction, which is supported by a mean field approximation. We also validate a
theoretical framework which describes the compaction from a local view. Our
experimental framework provides insights into the granular micro-mechanisms and
opens new perspectives for rheological analysis of highly deformable grain
assemblies in various fields ranging from biology to engineering.

A plethora of two-dimensional (2D) materials entered the physics and
engineering scene in the last two decades. Their robust, membrane-like sheet
permit -- mostly require -- deposition, giving rise to solid-solid dry
interfaces whose bodily mobility, pinning, and general tribological properties
under shear stress are currently being understood and controlled,
experimentally and theoretically. In this Colloquium we use simulation case
studies of twisted graphene system as a prototype workhorse tool to demonstrate
and discuss the general picture of 2D material interface sliding. First, we
highlight the crucial mechanical difference, often overlooked, between small
and large incommensurabilities, corresponding e.g., to small and large twist
angles in graphene interfaces. In both cases, focusing on flat, structurally
lubric, "superlubric" geometries, we elucidate and review the generally
separate scaling with area of static friction in pinned states and of kinetic
friction during sliding, tangled as they are with the effects of velocity,
temperature, load, and defects. Including the role of island boundaries and of
elasticity, and corroborating when possible the existing case-by-case results
in literature beyond graphene, the overall picture proposed is meant for
general 2D material interfaces, that are of importance for the physics and
technology of existing and future bilayer and multilayer systems.

Despite symmetrical polarization, the magnitude of a light-induced voltage is
known to be asymmetric with respect to poling sign in many photovoltaic (PV)
ferroelectrics (FEs). This asymmetry remains unclear and is often attributed to
extrinsic effects. We show here for the first time that such an asymmetry can
be intrinsic, steaming from the superposition of asymmetries of internal FE
bias and electro-piezo-strictive deformation. This hypothesis is confirmed by
the observed decrease of PV asymmetry for smaller FE bias. Moreover, the both
PV effect and remanent polarization are found to increase under vacuum-induced
expansion and to decrease for gas-induced compression, with tens percents
tunability. The change in cations positions under pressure is analysed through
the first-principle density functional theory calculations. The reported
properties provide key insight for FE-based solar elements optimization.

Ni thin films grown by thermal evaporation and sputtering under different
deposition conditions are characterized for structural and morphological
properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
techniques. XRD results suggested the growth of polycrystalline fcc Ni phase
for all the samples. Morphological characteristics of the films were compared
by analysing AFM data for root mean square roughness, height-height correlation
function and power spectral density (PSD) measurements. Applying fractal and
k-correlation fitting models to the PSD data, different morphological
parameters are quantified. The study suggested that Ni films grown at higher
substrate temperature (~ 150 oC) by thermal evaporation and at low Ar pressure
(~ 0.2 Pa) by sputtering techniques yielded films of small surface roughness
with Brownian fractal self-affine surfaces.

We investigate the non-Hermitian Haldane model on hyperbolic $\{8, 3\}$ and
$\{12, 3\}$ lattices, and showcase its intriguing topological properties in the
simultaneous presence of non-Hermitian effect and hyperbolic geometry. From
bulk descriptions of the system, we calculate the real space non-Hermitian
Chern numbers by generalizing the method from its Hermitian counterpart and
present corresponding phase diagram of the model. For boundaries, we find that
skin-topological modes appear in the range of the bulk energy gap under certain
boundary conditions, which can be explained by an effective one-dimensional
zigzag chain model mapped from hyperbolic lattice boundary. Remarkably, these
skin-topological modes are localized at specific corners of the boundary,
constituting a hybrid higher-order skin-topological effect on hyperbolic
lattices.

We characterize the role of the roton instability in the formation of a
supersolid state of an elongated dipolar condensate, following a quench of the
contact interactions across the superfluid-supersolid transition, as observed
in recent experiments. We perform dynamical simulations by means of the
extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation including quantum corrections, for different
final values of the $s-$wave scattering length. The corresponding excitation
spectrum is computed using an effective one-dimensional description, revealing
that the calculated growth rates of the unstable roton mode accurately
reproduce the observed behavior. Our results provide valuable insights
regarding the formation time of the supersolid and its scaling behavior with
respect to the $s$-wave scattering length.

MXenes are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides with
remarkable properties and great potential for energy storage and catalysis
applications. However, their oxidation behavior is not yet fully understood,
and there are still open questions regarding the spatial distribution and
precise quantification of surface terminations, intercalated ions, and possible
uncontrolled impurities incorporated during synthesis and processing. Here,
atom probe tomography analysis of as-synthesized Ti3C2Tx MXenes reveals the
presence of alkali (Li, Na) and halogen (Cl, F) elements as well as unetched
Al. Following oxidation of the colloidal solution of MXenes, it is observed
that the alkalies enriched in TiO2 nanowires. Although these elements are
tolerated through the incorporation by wet chemical synthesis, they are often
overlooked when the activity of these materials is considered, particularly
during catalytic testing. This work demonstrates how the capability of atom
probe tomography to image these elements in 3D at the near-atomic scale can
help to better understand the activity and degradation of MXenes, in order to
guide their synthesis for superior functional properties.

<h3>A model for the contraction kinetics of cytoskeletal gel slabs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19824" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19824</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Cytoskeletal gels are engineered prototypes that mimic the contractile
behavior of a cell in-vitro. They are composed of an active polymer matrix and
a liquid solvent. Their contraction kinetics is governed by two dynamic
phenomena: mechanotransduction (molecular motor activation), and solvent
diffusion. In this paper, we solve the transient problem for the simple case of
a thin gel slab in uniaxial contraction under two extreme conditions:
motor-limited or slow motor activation (SM) regime, and diffusion-limited or
fast motor activation (FM) regime. The former occurs when diffusion is much
faster than mechanotransduction, while the latter occurs in the opposite case.
We observe that in the SM regime, the contraction time scales as t/t_0 ~
(l/l_0)^(-3), with t_0 the nominal contraction time, and l and l_0 are the
final and initial stretches of the slab. t_0 is proportional to 1/w, where w is
the average mechanical power generated by the molecular motors per unit
reference (dry polymer) volume. In the FM regime, the contraction time scales
as t/t_1 ~ (1-l/l_0)^2, with t_1 the nominal contraction time, here
proportional to the ratio L^2/D, where L is the reference (dry polymer)
thickness, and D is the diffusivity of the solvent in the gel. The transition
between the SM and FM regimes is defined by a characteristic power density w^*,
where w << w^* gives the SM regime and w >> w^* gives the FM regime.
Intuitively, w^* is proportional to D/L^2, where, at a given power density w, a
thinner gel slab (smaller L) or including smaller solvent molecules (higher D)
is more likely to be in the SM regime given that solvent diffusion will occur
faster than motor activation.

<br>
The density functional plus dynamical mean-field theory is used to study the
spin excitation spectra of SrRu$_2$O$_6$. A good quantitative agreement with
experimental spin excitation spectra is found. Depending on the size of the
Hund's coupling $J_H$ the systems chooses either Mott insulator or covalent
insulator state when magnetic ordering is not allowed. We find that the nature
of the paramagnetic state has negligible influence on the charge and spin
excitation spectra. We find that antiferromagnetic correlations hide the
covalent insulator state for realistic choices of the interaction parameters.

We study the quasiparticle properties of a dipolar impurity immersed in a
two-dimensional dipolar bath. We use the ab-initio Diffusion Monte Carlo
technique to determine the polaron energy, effective mass and quasiparticle
residue. We find that these quantities follow a universal behaviour when
properly scaled in terms of the polarization angle and scattering length. This
trend is maintained over a wide range of values of the gas parameter, even in
the highly correlated regime. Additionally, we show that the anisotropy of the
impurity-bath interaction leads to an anisotropic effective mass that is
unexpectedly larger in the direction of minimum repulsion of the impurity-bath
interaction. Finally, we use our Monte Carlo results to check the accuracy of
perturbative approaches and determine their range of validity in terms of the
gas parameter.

Recent advances in multistable metamaterials reveal a link between structural
configuration transition and Boolean logic, heralding a new generation of
computationally capable intelligent materials. To enable higher-level
computation, existing computational frameworks require the integration of
large-scale networked logic gates, which places demanding requirements on the
fabrication of materials counterparts and the propagation of signals. Inspired
by cellular automata, we propose a novel computational framework based on
multistable origami metamaterials by incorporating reservoir computing, which
can accomplish high-level computation tasks without the need to construct a
logic gate network. This approach thus eleimates the demanding requirements for
fabrication of materials and signal propagation when constructing large-scale
networks for high-level computation in conventional mechano-logic. Using the
multistable stacked Miura-origami metamaterial as a validation platform, digit
recognition is successfully implemented through experiments by a single
actuator. Moreover, complex tasks, such as handwriting recognition and 5-bit
memory tasks, are also shown to be feasible with the new computation framework.
Our research represents a significant advancement in developing a new
generation of intelligent materials with advanced computational capabilities.
With continued research and development, these materials could have a
transformative impact on a wide range of fields, from computational science to
material mechano-intelligence technology and beyond.

The discovery of new functional materials is one of the key challenges in
materials science. Combinatorial high-throughput approaches using reactive
sputtering are commonly employed to screen unexplored phase spaces. During
reactive combinatorial deposition the process conditions are rarely optimized,
which can lead to poor crystallinity of the thin films. In addition, sputtering
at shallow deposition angles can lead to off-axis preferential orientation of
the grains. This can make the results from a conventional structural phase
screening ambiguous. Here we perform a combinatorial screening of the Zn-Ta-N
phase space with the aim to synthesize the novel semiconductor Zn2TaN3. While
the results of the XRD phase screening are inconclusive, including chemical
state analysis mapping in our workflow allows us to see a very clear
discontinuity in the evolution of the Ta binding environment. This is
indicative of the formation of a new ternary phase. In additional experiments,
we isolate the material and perform a detailed characterization confirming the
formation of single phase WZ-Zn2TaN3. Besides the formation of the new ternary
nitride, we map the functional properties of ZnxTa1-xN and report previously
unreported clean chemical state analysis for Zn3N2, TaN and Zn2TaN3. Overall,
the results of this study showcase common challenges in high-throughput
materials screening and highlight the merit of employing characterization
techniques sensitive towards changes in the materials' short-range order and
chemical state.

The resulting microstructure after the sintering process determines many
materials properties of interest. In order to understand the microstructural
evolution, simulations are often employed. One such simulation method is the
phase-field method, which has garnered much interest in recent decades.
However, the method lacks a complete model for sintering, as previous works
could show unphysical effects and the inability to reach representative volume
elements. Thus the present paper aims to close this gap by employing molecular
dynamics and determining rules of motion which can be translated to a
phase-field model. The resulting phase-field model is shown to be
representative starting from particle counts between 97 and 262 and contains
the qualitative correct dependence of sintering rate on particle size.

Kekul\'e-O order in graphene, which has recently been realized
experimentally, induces Dirac electron masses on the order of $m \sim
100\text{meV}$. We show that twisted bilayer graphene in which one or both
layers have Kekul\'e-O order exhibits nontrivial flat electronic bands on
honeycomb and kagome lattices. When only one layer has Kekul\'e-O order, there
is a parameter regime for which the lowest four bands at charge neutrality form
an isolated two-orbital honeycomb lattice model with two flat bands. The
bandwidths are minimal at a magic twist angle $\theta \approx 0.7^\circ$ and
Dirac mass $m \approx 100\text{meV}$. When both layers have Kekul\'e-O order,
there is a large parameter regime around $\theta\approx 1^\circ$ and $m\gtrsim
100\text{meV}$ in which the lowest three valence and conduction bands at charge
neutrality each realize isolated kagome lattice models with one flat band,
while the next three valence and conduction bands are flat bands on triangular
lattices. These flat band systems may provide a new platform for strongly
correlated phases of matter.

Green hydrogen production is crucial for a sustainable future, but current
catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffer from slow kinetics,
despite many efforts to produce optimal designs, particularly through the
calculation of descriptors for activity. In this study, we develop a dataset of
density functional theory calculations of bulk and surface perovskite oxides,
and adsorption energies of OER intermediates, which includes compositions up to
quaternary and facets up to (555). We demonstrate that per-site properties of
perovskite oxides such as Bader charge or band center can be tuned through
element substitution and faceting, and develop a machine learning model that
accurately predicts these properties directly from the local chemical
environment. We leverage these per-site properties to identify promising
perovskites with high theoretical OER activity. The identified design
principles and promising new materials provide a roadmap for closing the gap
between current artificial catalysts and biological enzymes.

<h3>Finite-size relaxational dynamics of a spike random matrix spherical  model</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a thorough numerical analysis of the relaxational dynamics of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spherical model with an additive non-disordered
perturbation for large but finite sizes $N$. In the thermodynamic limit and at
low temperatures, the perturbation is responsible for a phase transition from a
spin glass to a ferromagnetic phase. We show that finite size effects induce
the appearance of a distinctive slow regime in the relaxation dynamics, the
extension of which depends on the size of the system and also on the strength
of the non-disordered perturbation. The long time dynamics is characterized by
the two largest eigenvalues of a spike random matrix which defines the model,
and particularly by the statistics of the gap between them. We characterize the
finite size statistics of the two largest eignevalues of the spike random
matrices in the different regimes, sub-critical, critical and super-critical,
confirming some known results and anticipating others, even in the less studied
critical regime. We also numerically characterize the finite size statistics of
the gap, which we hope may encourage analytical work which is lacking. Finally,
we compute the finite size scaling of the long time relaxation of the energy,
showing the existence of power laws with exponents that depend on the strenght
of the non-disordered perturbation, in a way which is governed by the finite
size statistics of the gap.

<h3>Dark Matter Detection with Strongly Correlated Topological Materials:  Flatband Effect</h3>

<br>

Dirac materials have been proposed as a new class of electron-based detectors
for light dark-matter (DM) scattering or absorption, with predicted
sensitivities far exceeding superconductors and superfluid helium. The
superiority of Dirac materials originates from a significantly reduced
in-medium dielectric response winning over the suppression of DM scattering
owing to the limited phase space at the point-like Fermi surface. Here we
propose a new route to enhance significantly the DM detection efficiency via
strongly correlated topological semimetals. Specifically, by considering a
strongly correlated Weyl semimetal model system, we demonstrate that the strong
correlation-induced flatband effects can amplify the coupling and detection
sensitivity to light DM particles by expanding the scattering phase space,
while maintaining a weak dielectric in-medium response.

Many recipes for realizing topological superconductivity rely on broken
time-reversal symmetry, which is often attained by applying a substantial
external magnetic field. Alternatively, using magnetic materials can offer
advantages through low-field operation and design flexibility on the nanoscale.
Mechanisms for lifting spin degeneracy include exchange coupling,
spin-dependent scattering, spin injection-all requiring direct contact between
the bulk or induced superconductor and a magnetic material. Here, we implement
locally broken time-reversal symmetry through dipolar coupling from nearby
micromagnets to superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowire devices. Josephson
supercurrent is hysteretic due to micromangets switching. At or around zero
external magnetic field, we observe an extended presence of Andreev bound
states near zero voltage bias. We also show a zero-bias peak plateau of a
non-quantized value. Our findings largely reproduce earlier results where
similar effects were presented in the context of topological superconductivity
in a homogeneous wire, and attributed to more exotic time-reversal breaking
mechanisms [1]. In contrast, our stray field profiles are not designed to
create Majorana modes, and our data are compatible with a straightforward
interpretation in terms of trivial states in quantum dots. At the same time,
the use of micromagnets in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices shows
promise for future experiments on topological superconductivity.

<h3>Measuring irreversibility from learned representations of biological  patterns</h3>

Thermodynamic irreversibility is a crucial property of living matter.
Irreversible processes maintain spatiotemporally complex structures and
functions characteristic of living systems. Robust and general quantification
of irreversibility remains a challenging task due to nonlinearities and
influences of many coupled degrees of freedom. Here we use deep learning to
reveal tractable, low-dimensional representations of patterns in a canonical
protein signaling process -- the Rho-GTPase system -- as well as complex
Ginzburg-Landau dynamics. We show that our representations recover activity
levels and irreversibility trends for a range of patterns. Additionally, we
find that our irreversibility estimates serve as a dynamical order parameter,
distinguishing stable and chaotic dynamics in these nonlinear systems. Our
framework leverages advances in deep learning to quantify the nonequilibrium
and nonlinear behavior of complex living processes.

<h3>Structure of jammed ellipse packings with a wide range of aspect ratios</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated in part by the recent observation of liquid glass in suspensions of
ellipsoidal colloids, we examine the structure of jammed ellipse packings over
a much wider range of particle aspect ratios ($\alpha$) than has been
previously attempted. We determine $\phi_{\rm J}(\alpha)$ to high precision,
and find empirical analytic formulae that predict $\phi_{\rm J}(\alpha)$ to
within less than 0.1% for all $1 \leq \alpha \leq 10$, for three different
particle dispersities. We find that the densest packings possess
unusually-well-defined nearest-neighbor shells, including both a higher
fraction $f_{\rm Z = 6}$ of particles with exactly six contacts and a
previously-unreported short-range order marked by ``kinetically suppressed''
regions in their positional-orientational pair correlation function $g(r,\Delta
\theta)$. We also show that the previously-reported approach to isostaticity
(coordination number $Z_{\rm J} \to Z_{\rm iso} \equiv 6$) with increasing
$\alpha$ is interrupted and then reversed as local nematic order increases:
$Z_{\rm J}(\alpha)$ drops towards 4 as ellipses are more often trapped by
contacts with a parallel-oriented neighbor on either side and a
perpendicularly-oriented neighbor on either end. Finally we show that
$\phi_{\rm J}/\phi_{\rm s}$ (where $\phi_{\rm s}$ is the saturated RSA packing
density) is nearly $\alpha$-independent for systems that do not develop
substantial local hexatic or nematic order during compression.

<h3>Hardness and fracture toughness models by symbolic regression</h3>

Superhard materials with good fracture toughness have found wide industrial
applications, which necessitates the development of accurate hardness and
fracture toughness models for efficient materials design. Although several
macroscopic models have been proposed, they are mostly semiempirical based on
prior knowledge or assumptions, and obtained by fitting limited experimental
data. Here, through an unbiased and explanatory symbolic regression technique,
we built a macroscopic hardness model and fracture toughness model, which only
require shear and bulk moduli as inputs. The developed hardness model was
trained on an extended dataset, which not only includes cubic systems, but also
contains non-cubic systems with anisotropic elastic properties. The obtained
models turned out to be simple, accurate, and transferable. Moreover, we
assessed the performance of three popular deep learning models for predicting
bulk and shear moduli, and found that the crystal graph convolutional neural
network and crystal explainable property predictor perform almost equally well,
both better than the atomistic line graph neural network. By combining the
machine-learned bulk and shear moduli with the hardness and fracture toughness
prediction models, potential superhard materials with good fracture toughness
can be efficiently screened out through high-throughput calculations.

<h3>Resampling schemes in population annealing -- numerical and theoretical  results</h3>

The population annealing algorithm is a population-based equilibrium version
of simulated annealing. It can sample thermodynamic systems with rough
free-energy landscapes more efficiently than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo
alone. A number of parameters can be fine-tuned to improve the performance of
the PA algorithm. While there is some numerical and theoretical work on most of
these parameters, there appears to be a gap in the literature concerning the
role of resampling in population annealing which this work attempts to close.
The two-dimensional Ising model is used as a benchmarking system for this
study. At first various resampling methods are implemented and numerically
compared. In a second part the exact solution of the Ising model is utilized to
create an artificial population annealing setting with effectively infinite
Monte Carlo updates at each temperature. This limit is first performed on
finite population sizes and in a second step extended to infinite populations.
This allows us to look at resampling isolated from other parameters. Many
results are expected to generalize to other systems.

Three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals have recently gained
significant attention, since they possess exotic quantum states. When
constructing Josephson junctions utilizing these materials as the weak link,
the fractional ac Josephson effect emerges in the presence of a topological
supercurrent contribution. We investigate the ac Josephson effect in a Dirac
semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ nanowire using two complementary methods: by probing the
radiation spectrum and by measuring Shapiro patterns. With both techniques, we
find that conventional supercurrent dominates at all investigated doping levels
and that any potentially present topological contribution falls below our
detection threshold. The inclusion of thermal noise in a resistively and
capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model allows us to reproduce the microwave
characteristics of the junction. With this refinement, we explain how weak
superconducting features can be masked and provide a framework to account for
elevated electronic temperatures present in realistic experimental scenarios.

Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures integrated into nanophotonic cavities
have emerged as a promising approach towards novel photonic and opto-electronic
devices. However, the thickness of the 2D heterostructure has a strong
influence on the resonance frequency of the hybrid cavity. For a single cavity,
the resonance frequency shifts approximately linearly with the thickness. Here,
we propose to use the inherent non-linearity of the mode coupling to render the
cavity mode insensitive to the thickness of the 2D heterostructure. Based on
the couple mode theory, we reveal that this goal can be achieved using either a
homoatomic molecule with a filtered coupling or heteroatomic molecules. We
perform numerical simulations to further demonstrate the robustness of the
eigenfrequency in the proposed photonic molecules. Our results render
nanophotonic structures insensitive to the thickness of 2D materials, thus
owing appealing potential in energy- or detuning-sensitive applications such as
cavity quantum electrodynamics.

The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can
result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has
been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter
physics. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature
superconductivity and can host topological properties with potential
applications in quantum information science. The excitations of most quantum
spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as
spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in
one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL
behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here we investigate the
novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective
spin-1/2 moments with no inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements performed on high-quality
single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range
magnetic ordering down to 60 mK, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the heat
capacity and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the
Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and INS spectra suggest
that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with gapless spinon excitations concentrated
at certain points in the Brillouin zone, and additional features in INS are
also consistent with theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular
lattice.

The notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking has been well established to
characterize classical and quantum phase transitions of matters, such as in
condensation, crystallization, and quantum magnetism, etc. Generalizations of
this paradigm to the time dimension can further lead to an exotic dynamical
phase, the time crystal, which spontaneously breaks the time translation
symmetry of the system [1]. While the existence of a continuous time crystal at
equilibrium has been challenged by the no-go theorems [2, 3], the difficulty
can be circumvented by the dissipation in an open system. Here, we report the
experimental observation of such a dissipative time crystalline order in a
room-temperature atomic gas, where ground-state atoms are continuously driven
to Rydberg states via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The
emergent time crystal is revealed by persistent oscillations of the probe-field
transmission, with ultralong lifetime and no observable damping during the
measurement. We show that the observed limit cycles arise from the coexistence
and competition between distinct Rydberg components, in agreement with a
mean-field analysis derived from the microscopic model. The random phase
distribution of the oscillation for repeated realizations, together with the
robustness against temporal noises further supports our realization of a
dissipative time crystal.

We study the many-body localization (MBL) transition in a generalized
Aubry-Andre model (also known as the GPD model) introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett.
114, 146601 (2015). In contrast to MBL in other disordered or quasiperiodic
models, the interaction seems to unexpectedly enhance MBL in the GPD model in
some parameter ranges. To understand this counter-intuitive result, we
demonstrate that the highest-energy single-particle band in the GPD model is
unstable against even infinitesimal disorder, which leads to this surprising
MBL phenomenon in the interacting model. We develop a mean-field theory
description to understand the coupling between extended and localized states,
which we validate using extensive exact diagonalization and DMRG-X numerical
results.
