<h3>Emergence of a Non-van der Waals Magnetic Phase in a van der Waals  Ferromagnet</h3>

Manipulation of long-range order in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW)
magnetic materials (e.g., CrI$_3$, CrSiTe$_3$ etc.), exfoliated in few-atomic
layer, can be achieved via application of electric field,
mechanical-constraint, interface engineering, or even by chemical
substitution/doping. Usually, active surface oxidation due to the exposure in
the ambient condition and hydrolysis in the presence of water/moisture causes
degradation in magnetic nanosheets which, in turn, affects the
nanoelectronic/spintronic device performance. Counterintuitively, our current
study reveals that exposure to the air at ambient atmosphere results in advent
of a stable nonlayered secondary ferromagnetic phase in the form of
Cr$_2$Te$_3$ (T$_{C2}$ ~ 160 K) in the parent vdW magnetic semiconductor
Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (T$_{C1}$ ~ 69 K). In addition, the magnetic anisotropy
energy (MAE) enhances in the hybrid by an order from the weakly anisotropic
pristine Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ crystal, increasing the stability of the FM ground
state with time. Comparing with the freshly prepared Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, the
coexistence of the two ferromagnetic phases in the time elapsed bulk crystal is
confirmed through systematic investigation of crystal structure along with
detailed dc/ac magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and magnetotransport
measurement. To capture the concurrence of the two ferromagnetic phases in a
single material, Ginzburg-Landau theory with two independent order parameters
(as magnetization) with a coupling term can be introduced. In contrast to
rather common poor environmental stability of the vdW magnets, our results open
possibilities of finding air-stable novel materials having multiple magnetic
phases.

<h3>Framework for engineering of spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride by  focused ion beams</h3>

Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is gaining interest as a wide bandgap van der
Waals host of optically active spin defects for quantum technologies. Most
studies of the spin-photon interface in hBN focus on the negatively charged
boron vacancy (VB-) defect, which is typically fabricated by ion irradiation.
However, VB- fabrication methods often lack robustness and reproducibility when
applied to thin flakes (less than 10 nm) of hBN. Here we identify mechanisms
that both promote and inhibit VB- generation and optimize ion beam parameters
for site-specific fabrication of optically active VB- centers. We emphasize
conditions accessible by high resolution focused ion beam (FIB) systems, and
present a framework for VB- fabrication in hBN flakes of arbitrary thickness
for applications in quantum sensing and quantum information processing.

<h3>Hydrodynamic finite-size scaling of the thermal conductivity in glasses</h3>

<br>
In the past few years, the theory of thermal transport in amorphous solids
has been substantially extended beyond the Allen-Feldman model. The resulting
formulation, based on the Green-Kubo linear response or the Wigner-transport
equation, bridges this model for glasses with the traditional Boltzmann kinetic
approach for crystals. The computational effort required by these methods
usually scales as the cube of the number of atoms, thus severely limiting the
size range of computationally affordable glass models. Leveraging hydrodynamic
arguments, we show how this issue can be overcome through a simple formula to
extrapolate a reliable estimate of the bulk thermal conductivity of glasses
from finite models of moderate size. We showcase our findings for realistic
models of paradigmatic glassy materials.

<h3>Modifying the magnetoelectric coupling in TbMnO$_3$ by low-level  Fe$^{3+}$ substitution</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report a comprehensive study of the low-level substitution of Mn$^{3+}$ by
Fe$^{3+}$ effect on the static and dynamic magnetoelectric coupling in
TbMn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$O$_3$ ($x=0$, 0.02 and 0.04). The cationic substitution has a
large impact on the balance between competitive magnetic interactions and, as a
result, on the stabilization of the magnetic structures and ferroelectric phase
at low temperatures. Low-lying electromagnon excitation is activated in the
cycloidal modulated antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric phase in TbMnO$_3$,
while it is observed up to TN in the Fe-substituted compounds, pointing for
different mechanisms for static and dynamic magnetoelectric coupling. A second
electrically active excitation near 40 cm$^{-1}$ is explained by means of Tb3+
crystal-field effects. This excitation is observed up to room temperature, and
exhibits a remarkable 15 cm$^{-1}$ downshift on cooling in Fe-substituted
compounds. Both electromagnon and crystal-field excitations are found to be
coupled to the polar phonons with frequencies up to 250 cm$^{-1}$. Raman
spectroscopy reveals a spin-phonon coupling below TN in pure TbMnO$_3$, but the
temperature where the coupling start to be relevant increases with Fe
concentration and reaches 100 K in TbMn$_{0.96}$Fe$_{0.04}$O$_3$. The anomalies
in the T-dependence of magnetic susceptibility above TN are well accounted by
spin-phonon coupling and crystal-field excitation, coupled to oxygen motions.

<h3>Spontaneous flows and dynamics of full-integer topological defects in  polar active matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07063" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07063</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas Rønning, Julian Renaud, Amin Doostmohammadi, Luiza angheluta</i>
<br>
<br>
Polar active matter of self-propelled particles sustain spontaneous flows
through the full-integer topological defects. We study theoretically the effect
of both polar and dipolar active forces on the flow profile around $\pm 1$
defects and their interaction in the presence of both viscosity and frictional
dissipation. The vorticity induced by the active stress is non-zero at the $+1$
defect contributing to the active torque acting on the defect. A near-core flow
reversal is predicted in absence of hydrodynamic screening (zero friction) as
observed in numerical simulations. While $\pm 1$ defects are sources of
spontaneous flows due to active stresses, they become sinks of flows induced by
the polar active forces. We show analytically that the flow velocity induced by
polar active forces increases away from a $\pm 1$ defect towards the uniform
far-field, while its associated vorticity field decays as $1/r$ in the
far-field. In the friction-dominated regime, we demonstrate that the flow
induced by polar active forces enhances defect pair annihilation, and depends
only on the orientation between a pair of oppositely charged defects relative
to the orientation of the background polarization field. Interestingly, we find
that this annihilation dynamics through mutual defect-defect interactions is
distance independent, in contradiction with the effect of dipolar active forces
which decay inversely proportional to the defect separation distance. As such,
our analyses reveals a new, truly long-ranged mechanism for the pairwise
interaction of oppositely-charged topological defects in polar active matter.

<h3>Exploring phonon-like interactions in one-dimensional Bose-Fermi  mixtures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07083</a>
<br>
<i>Axel Gagge, Th. K. Mavrogordatos, Jonas Larson</i>
<br>
<br>
With the objective of simulating the physical behaviour of electrons moving
in a dynamical background, we study a cold atomic Bose-Fermi mixture in an
optical lattice potential felt only by the bosons. The bosons, assumed to be in
the deep superfluid regime, inherit the periodicity of the optical lattice and
subsequently act as a dynamical potential for the polarized fermions. Due to
the atom-phonon interaction between the fermions and the condensate, the
coupled system displays a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from a
Luttinger liquid to a Peierls phase. For sufficiently strong Bose-Fermi
interaction, however, the Peierls phase becomes unstable and is succeeded by
either a collapsed or a separated phase. We find that the main role of the
optical lattice amounts to stabilizing the Peierls phase. Furthermore, the
presence of a confining harmonic trap leads to a rich physical behaviour beyond
what is observed for either bosons or fermions separately trapped. In
particular, for an attractive Bose-Fermi interaction, the insulating phase may
develop a fermionic wedding-cake like configuration reflecting the dynamical
nature of the underlying lattice potential. For repulsive interaction, on the
other hand, we conclude that the trap destabilizes the Peierls phase and the
two species separate.

<h3>Transversal effects on the ground-state of hard-core dipolar bosons in  one-dimensional optical lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07217</a>
<br>
<i>H. Korbmacher, G. A. Domínguez-Castro, W. Li, J. Zakrzewski, L. Santos</i>
<br>
<br>
Polar lattice gases are usually assumed to have an inter-site interaction
that decays with the inter-particle distance $r$ as $1/r^3$. However, a
loose-enough transversal confinement may strongly modify the dipolar decay in
one-dimensional lattices. We show that this modification alters significantly
the ground-state properties of hard-core dipolar bosons. For repulsive
inter-site interactions, the corrected decay alters the conditions for devil's
staircase insulators, affecting significantly the particle distribution in the
presence of an overall harmonic confinement. For attractive interactions, it
results in a reduction of the critical dipole interaction for the formation of
self-bound clusters, and for a marked enhancement of the region of liquefied
lattice droplets.

<h3>Unconventional Gross-Neveu quantum criticality: SO(3)-biadjoint Mott  insulator and emergent SU(3) symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06162</a>
<br>
<i>Shouryya Ray</i>
<br>
<br>
I point out that Gross-Neveu theory with SO(3) isospin in three spacetime
dimensions - proposed recently, for instance, as an effective description of
the N\'eel transition in certain spin-orbital liquids - also hosts quantum
criticality of a more exotic kind. The ordered phase breaks SO(3)
spontaneously, but the SO(3)-N\'eel order parameter vanishes. The fermionic
bilinear order parameter is instead a biadjoint with respect to SO(3); unlike
its N\'eel cousin, it constitutes a Mott insulator. Furthermore, I show that
the N\'eel and biadjoint order parameters can be combined to transform as an
adjoint under SU(3) symmetry; the symmetry is emergent at the critical point
separating the symmetric semimetal and the biadjoint insulator, but only if the
flavor number is small enough, suggesting order-parameter fluctuations and the
interplay between different channels play a crucial role in stabilizing the
enlarged symmetry. In candidate SO(3) spin-orbital liqiuds, thermodynamic
critical exponents carry fingerprints of "spinons". The existence of an
independent universality class in addition to the N\'eel transition opens the
possibility of posing further constraints on spinon properties from
thermodynamic measurements near criticality alone.

<h3>Geometrically-frustrated interactions drive structural complexity in  amorphous calcium carbonate</h3>

Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is an important precursor for
biomineralisation in marine organisms. Among the key outstanding problems
regarding ACC are how best to understand its structure and how to rationalise
its metastability as an amorphous phase. Here, we report high-quality atomistic
models of ACC generated by using state-of-the-art interatomic potentials to
help guide fits to X-ray total scattering data. Exploiting a recently-developed
inversion approach, we extract from these models the effective
Ca$\boldsymbol\cdots$Ca interaction potential governing ACC formation. This
potential contains minima at two competing distances, corresponding to the two
different ways in which carbonate ions bridge Ca$^{2+}$-ion pairs. We reveal an
unexpected mapping to the Lennard-Jones--Gauss (LJG) model normally studied in
the context of computational soft-matter, with the empirical LJG parameters for
ACC taking values known to promote structural complexity. In this way we show
that both the complex structure of ACC and its resilience to crystallisation
are actually encoded in the geometrically-frustrated effective interactions
between Ca$^{\boldsymbol 2+}$ ions.

<h3>Efficient Spin-Orbit Torque in Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator  MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06181" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06181</a>

<br>

We formulate and quantify the spin-orbit torque (SOT) in intrinsic
antiferromagnetic topological insulator $\rm MnBi_2Te_4$ of a few
septuple-layer thick, which exhibits conspicuous layer-resolved
characteristics. Contrary to known current-induced torques, the SOT in
insulating $\rm MnBi_2Te_4$ is driven by an electric field (or voltage). We
further study the SOT-induced magnetic resonances, where in the
tri-septuple-layer case we identify a peculiar exchange mode that is blind to
microwaves but can be exclusively driven by the predicted SOT. As an inverse
effect of the SOT, topological charge pumping generates an adiabatic current
devoid of Joule heating, which occurs concomitantly with the SOT and gives rise
to an overall magneto-reactance for $\rm MnBi_2Te_4$, enabling a lossless
conversion of electric power into magnetic dynamics.

<h3>Exploring the Charge Density Wave phase of 1$T$-TaSe$_2$: Mott or  Charge-transfer Gap?</h3>

<br>
<br>
1$T$-TaSe$_2$ is widely believed to host a Mott metal-insulator transition in
the charge density wave (CDW) phase according to the spectroscopic observation
of a band gap that extends across all momentum space. Previous investigations
inferred that the occurrence of the Mott phase is limited to the surface only
of bulk specimens, but recent analysis on thin samples revealed that the
Mott-like behavior, observed in the monolayer, is rapidly suppressed with
increasing thickness. Here, we report combined time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical investigations of the electronic
structure of 1$T$-TaSe$_2$. Our experimental results confirm the existence of a
state above $E_F$, previously ascribed to the upper Hubbard band, and an
overall band gap of $\sim 0.7$ eV at $\overline{\Gamma}$. However, supported by
density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the origin of this
state and the gap rests on band structure modifications induced by the CDW
phase alone, without the need for Mott correlation effects.

<h3>Electrically Controlled Anomalous Hall Effect and Orbital Magnetization  in Topological Magnet MnBi2Te4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06204" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06204</a>
<br>
<i>Ruobing Mei, Yi-Fan Zhao, Chong Wang, Yafei Ren, Di Xiao, Cui-Zu Chang, Chao-Xing Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we propose an intrinsic mechanism to understand the even-odd
effect, namely the opposite signs of the anomalous Hall resistance and the
different shapes of hysteresis loops for even and odd septuple layers (SLs), of
MBE-grown MnBi2Te4 thin films with electron doping. In particular, we show that
the non-zero hysteresis loops in the anomalous Hall and magnetic circular
dichroism measurements for even-SLs MnBi2Te4 films are originated from two
different anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) states with opposite magnetoelectric
coefficients that give rise to different energies of zeroth Landau levels of
the surface states in this model. The complex form of the anomalous Hall
hysteresis loop in even-SLs MnBi2Te4 films can be understood from two magnetic
transitions, a transition from one AFM state to the other AFM state followed by
a second transition to the ferromagnetic state. Our model also provides a
microscopic understanding of the electrical switching between two AFM states
via the axion electrodynamics in even-SL MnBi2Te4 films. We further study
orbital magnetization and magnetoelectric coefficient in MnBi2Te4 films, and
find an even-odd oscillation behavior of the magnetoelectric coefficient.

<h3>Screening Induced Crossover between Phonon- and Plasmon-Mediated Pairing  in Layered Superconductors</h3>

Two-dimensional (2D) metals can host gapless plasmonic excitations, which
strongly couple to electrons and thus may significantly affect
superconductivity in layered materials. To investigate the dynamical interplay
of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the theory of 2D
superconductivity, we apply a full momentum- and frequency-dependent one-loop
theory treating electron-phonon, electron-plasmon, and phonon-plasmon coupling
with the same accuracy. We tune the strength of the Coulomb interaction by
varying the external screening $\varepsilon_{ext}$ to the layered
superconductor and find three distinct regions. At weak screening,
superconductivity is mediated by plasmons. In the opposite limit conventional
electron-phonon interactions dominate. In between, we find a suppressed
superconducting state. Our results show that even conventional electron-phonon
mediated layered superconductors can be significantly affected by the
electron-plasmon coupling in a weak screening environment. This unconventional
pairing contribution can then be controlled by the external screening.

<h3>Finite Elasticity of the Vertex Model and its Role in Rigidity of Curved  Cellular Tissues</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06224" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06224</a>
<br>
<i>Arthur Hernandez, Michael F. Staddon, Michael Moshe, M. Cristina Marchetti</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a mean field approach and simulation, we study the non-linear
mechanical response of the vertex model (VM) of biological tissue under
compression and dilation. The VM is known to exhibit a transition between rigid
and fluid-like, or floppy, states driven by geometric incompatibility. Target
perimeter and area set a target shape which may not be geometrically
achievable, thereby engendering frustration. Previously, an asymmetry in the
linear elastic response was identified at the rigidity transition between
compression and dilation. Here we show and characterize how the asymmetry
extends away from the transition point for finite strains. Under finite
compression, an initially solid VM can totally relax perimeter tension, and
thereby have reduced bulk and shear modulus. Conversely, an initially floppy VM
under dilation can rigidify and have a higher bulk and shear modulus. These
observations imply that re-scaling of cell area shifts the transition between
rigid and floppy states. Based on this insight, we calculate the re-scaling of
cell area engendered by intrinsic curvature and write a prediction for the
rigidity transition in the presence of curvature. The shift of the rigidity
transition in the presence of curvature for the VM provides a new metric for
predicting tissue rigidity from image data for curved tissues in a manner
analogous to the flat case.

<h3>Anisotropic excitonic photocurrent in $β$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06231" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06231</a>

<br>
<br>
Polarization dependent photocurrent spectra are measured on a (001)
$\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ Schottky photodetector, where the linear polarization
of light is rotated within the ab plane. Three spectral peaks at 4.92 eV, 5.15
eV, and 5.44 eV are observed that vary in intensity with the optical
polarization direction. The peak transition energies are consistent with
excitons previously reported in $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ due to interband
transitions modified by the valence band p-orbital anisotropy and the
electron-hole Coulombic attraction. The measured polarization-dependence of the
photocurrent matches our predictions based on electromagnetic simulations of
anisotropic absorption using the complex dielectric function tensor extracted
from previous ellipsometry studies. These results illustrate the dominance of
excitonic absorption and photocurrent in $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ both below and
above the band gap, demonstrate a combined theoretical/experimental
understanding of anisotropic photocarrier generation, and validate previous
atomistic band structure calculations in this low-symmetry ultra-wide band gap
semiconductor.

<h3>In-gap Nonlinear Spin Hall Current by Two-color Excitation in  Single-layer WTe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06238</a>
<br>
<i>Pankaj Bhalla, Habib Rostami</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we theoretically study the nonlinear spin currents in a gated
single-layer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ with strong spin-orbit coupling driven by an intense
laser pulse. We investigate both second and third-order spin currents under the
influence of an external displacement field. We use an effective low-energy
Hamiltonian for the modeling and employ Kubo's formalism based on Green's
function method. We obtain a large third-order two-color rectified spin Hall
current generated by the interference of two co-linear polarised light beams
that flows transverse to the incident laser polarisation direction. To gain a
better understanding of this phenomenon, we also calculated the second-order
rectified spin current by a single-color light beam and compared it with the
two-color spin current. To further explore this effect, we analyzed the impact
of out-of-plane gate potential, which breaks the inversion symmetry of the
system and efficiently manipulates the strength and sign of nonlinear spin Hall
responses. As the most striking result of this study, we predict an in-gap
nonlinear spin current induced by light without inter-band optical absorption.
The in-gap nonlinear charge current is discussed previously, and our finding
generalizes the effect on the spin channel and third-order response theory.

<h3>Can the dipolar interaction suppress dipolar relaxation?</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic atoms in a thin layer have repulsive interactions when their
magnetic moments are aligned perpendicular to the layer. We show experimentally
and theoretically how this can suppress dipolar relaxation, the dominant loss
process in spin mixtures of highly magnetic atoms. Using dysprosium, we observe
an order of magnitude extension of the lifetime, and another factor of ten is
within reach based on the models which we have validated with our experimental
study. The loss suppression opens up many new possibilities for quantum
simulations with spin mixtures of highly magnetic atoms.

The ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic nanostructure are crucial for
fundamental spintronics devices, motivated by its potential application in
spintronics, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of the
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the cylindrical intrinsically
magnetic topological insulator $\mathrm{MnBi_{2}Te_{4}}$ quantum wires for both
cases. We demonstrate that a few surface states exist between the bulk band gap
in the ferromagnetic phase, with only one spin branch. In the antiferromagnetic
phase, we show that three coexistent states exist between the energy gaps of
the quantum wires.

<h3>Quick Identification of ABC Trilayer Graphene at Nanoscale Resolution  via a Near-field Optical Route</h3>

<br>
ABC-stacked trilayer graphene has exhibited a variety of correlated phenomena
owing to its relatively flat bands and gate-tunable bandgap. However,
convenient methods are still lacking for identifying ABC graphene with
nanometer-scale resolution. Here we demonstrate that the scanning near-field
optical microscope (SNOM) working in ambient conditions can provide quick
recognition of ABC trilayer graphene with no ambiguity and excellent resolution
(~20 nm). The recognition is based on the difference in their near-field
infrared (IR) responses between the ABA and ABC trilayers. We show that in most
frequencies, the response of the ABC trilayer is weaker than the ABA trilayer.
However, near the graphene phonon frequency (~1585 cm-1), ABC's response
increases dramatically when gated and exhibits a narrow and sharp Fano-shape
resonant line, whereas the ABA trilayer is largely featherless. Consequently,
the IR contrast between ABC and ABA becomes reversed and can even be striking
(ABC/ABA~3) near the graphene phonon frequency. The observed near-field IR
features can serve as a golden rule to quickly distinguish ABA and ABC
trilayers with no ambiguity, which could largely advance the exploration of
correlation physics in ABC-stacked trilayer graphene.

We studied chemical interaction of Sn with H$_2$ by X-ray diffraction methods
at pressures of 180-210 GPa. A previously unknown tetrahydride SnH$_4$ with a
cubic structure (${fcc}$) exhibiting superconducting properties below ${T}$$_C$
= 72 K was obtained; the formation of a high molecular ${C2/m}$-SnH$_{14}$
superhydride and several lower hydrides, ${fcc}$ SnH$_2$ and
${C2}$-Sn$_{12}$H$_{18}$, was also detected. The temperature dependence of
critical current density ${J}$$_C$(T) in SnH$_4$ yields the superconducting gap
2$\Delta$(0) = 20-22 meV at 180 GPa. The SnH$_4$ superconductor has unusual
behavior in strong magnetic fields: linear temperature dependences of
magnetoresistance and the upper critical magnetic field ${B}$$_{C2}$(T)
$\propto$ (${T}$$_C$ - ${T}$). The latter contradicts the
Wertheimer-Helfand-Hohenberg model developed for conventional superconductors.
Along with this, the temperature dependence of electrical resistance of ${fcc}$
SnH$_4$ in normal resistivity state exhibits a deviation from what is expected
for phonon-mediated scattering described by the Bloch-Gr\"uneisen model, and is
beyond the framework of the Fermi liquid theory. Such anomalies occur for many
superhydrides, making them much closer to cuprates than previously believed.

In this work we present a rigorous and straightforward method to detect the
onset of the instability of replica-symmetric theories in information
processing systems, which does not require a full replica analysis as in the
method originally proposed by Almeida-Thouless for spin glasses. The method is
based on an expansion of the free-energy obtained within one-step of the
replica symmetry breaking (RSB) scheme around the replica-symmetric (RS) value.
As such, it requires solely continuity and differentiability of the free-energy
and it is robust to be applied broadly to systems with quenched disorder. We
apply the method to the Hopfield model and to neural networks with multi-node
Hebbian interactions, as case studies. In the appendix we test the method on
the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, the Ising P-spin and the spherical P-spin models,
recovering the AT lines known in the literature for these models, as a special
limit, which corresponds to assuming that the transition from the RS to the RSB
phase can be obtained by varying continuously the order parameters. Therefore,
our method provides a generalization of the AT approach, which can be applied
to systems with a discontinuous transition.

Periodic systems feature the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum produced by
Brown--Zak minibands of electrons formed when magnetic field flux through the
lattice unit cell is commensurate with flux quantum and manifested by
magneto-transport oscillations. Quantum oscillations, such as Shubnikov -- de
Haas effect and Aharonov--Bohm effect, are also characteristic for electronic
systems with closed orbits in real space and reciprocal space. Here we show the
intricate relation between these two phenomena by tracing quantum
magneto-oscillations to Lifshitz transitions in graphene superlattices, where
they persist even at relatively low fields and very much above liquid-helium
temperatures. The oscillations originate from Aharonov--Bohm interference on
cyclotron trajectories that form a kagom\'e-shaped network characteristic for
Lifshitz transitions. In contrast to Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations, the
kagom\'e oscillations are robust against thermal smearing and they can be
detected even when the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum is undermined by
electron's scattering. We expect that kagom\'e quantum oscillations are generic
to rotationally-symmetric two-dimensional crystals close to Lifshitz
transitions.

In the framework of the theoretical model of the phase transition of binary
solutions into spatially inhomogeneous states proposed earlier by the autors
[1], which takes into account nonlinear effects, the role of the cubic in
concentration term in the expansion of free energy was studied. It is shown
that taking into account the cubic term contributions to the stabilization of a
homogeneous state. The existence of two inhomogeneous phases in an isotropic
medium, considered in [1], proves to be possible only at half the concentration
of the solution. The contribution of inhomogeneity effects to thermodynamic
quantities is calculated. Phase transitions from a homogeneous state and
between inhomogeneous phases are second-order phase transitions.

A general lower bound for the entropy production rate based on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Logarithmic-Sobolev constant characterizing
the time-scale of relaxation is established, which can be regarded as an
enhanced second law of thermodynamics. As a crucial application, we find a
universal trade-off relation between the dissipation rate and relaxation
time-scale in thermal relaxation processes. Importantly, we show that a
thermodynamic upper bound of the relaxation time between two given states
follows directly from the trade-off relation, serving as an inverse speed limit
taking effect in the whole time region. Our results unveil some hidden
universal behaviors of thermal relaxation processes. Moreover, they can be
generalized to open quantum systems.

Dense micron-sized electron plasmas, such as those generated upon irradiation
of nanostructured metallic surfaces by intense femtosecond laser pulses,
constitute a rich playground to study light-matter interactions, many-body
phenomena, and out-of-equilibrium charge dynamics. Besides their fundamental
interest, laser-induced plasmas hold potential for the generation of localized
terahertz radiation pulses. However, the underlying mechanisms ruling the
formation and evolution of these plasmas is not yet well understood. Here, we
develop a comprehensive microscopic theory to predictably describe the
spatiotemporal dynamics of laser-pulse-induced plasmas. Through detailed
analysis of electron emission, metal screening, and plasma cloud interactions,
we investigate the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of the
so-generated terahertz fields, which can be extensively controlled through the
metal morphology and the illumination conditions. We further describe the
interaction with femtosecond electron beams to explain recent ultrafast
electron microscopy experiments, whereby the position and temporal dependence
of the observed electron acceleration permits assessing the associated
terahertz field. Besides its potential application to the design of
low-frequency light sources, our work contributes with fundamental insight on
the generation and dynamics of micron-scale electron plasmas and their
interaction with ultrafast electron pulses.

We demonstrate a magnetic tunnel junction injected with spin Hall current to
exhibit linear rotation of magnetization of the free-ferromagnet using only the
spin current. Using the linear resistance change of the MTJ, we devise a
circuit for the rectified linear activation (ReLU) function of the artificial
neuron. We explore the role of different spin Hall effect (SHE) heavy metal
layers on the power consumption of the ReLU circuit. We benchmark the power
consumption of the ReLU circuit with different SHE layers by defining a new
parameter called the spin Hall power factor. It combines the spin Hall angle,
resistivity, and thickness of the heavy metal layer, which translates to the
power consumption of the different SHE layers during spin-orbit
switching/rotation of the free FM. We employ a hybrid spintronics-CMOS
simulation framework that couples Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonzewski equations and the HSPICE
circuit simulator to account for diverse physics of spin-transport and the CMOS
elements in our proposed ReLU design. We also demonstrate the robustness of the
proposed ReLU circuit against thermal noise and non-trivial power-error
trade-off that enables the use of an unstable free-ferromagnet for
energy-efficient design. Using the proposed circuit, we evaluate the
performance of the convolutional neural network for MNIST datasets and
demonstrate comparable classification accuracies to the ideal ReLU with an
energy consumption of 75 $pJ$ per sample.

Photo-excited electrons and holes in insulators, above a critical density and
below a critical temperature, can condense to form an electron-hole liquid
(EHL) phase. However, observing the EHL phase at room temperature is extremely
challenging. Here, we introduce the monolayer MoSi$_2$Z$_4$ (Z= N, As, P)
series of compounds as a promising platform for observing the EHL phase at room
temperature. The higher impact of the Coulomb interactions in two dimensions
helps these monolayers support the EHL phase with an increased EHL binding
energy and transition temperature, along with strongly bound excitons. Our
findings motivate further exploration of the MoSi$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers for
realizing the EHL phase at high temperatures to harness collective phenomena
for optoelectronic applications.

Interatomic potentials provide a means to simulate extended length and time
scales that are outside the reach of ab initio calculations. The development of
an interatomic potential for a particular material requires the optimization of
the parameters of the functional form of the potential. We present a
parameterization protocol for analytic bond-order potentials (BOP) that provide
a physically transparent and computationally efficient description of the
interatomic interaction. The parameterization protocol of the BOP follows the
derivation of the BOP along the coarse-graining of the electronic structure
from density-functional theory (DFT) to the tight-binding (TB) bond model to
analytic BOPs. In particular, it starts from TB parameters that are obtained by
downfolding DFT eigenstates of two-atomic molecules to an $sd$-valent minimal
basis. This $sd$-valent Hamiltonian is combined with a pairwise repulsion to
obtain an initial binding energy relation. The $s$ electrons are then removed
from the Hamiltonian and instead represented by an isotropic embedding term. In
the final step, the parameters of the remaining $d$-$d$ interaction, the pair
repulsion and the embedding term are optimized simultaneously. We demonstrate
that the application of this parameterization protocol leads to a basic BOP for
Re with good transferability. We discuss different strategies to refine the
basic BOP towards global transferability or towards local accuracy. We
demonstrate that homogeneous samplings of the structural phase-space in a map
of local atomic environments can be used to systematically increase the global
transferability. We also demonstrate the influence of training data-weighting
on local accuracy refinements with a Pareto-front analysis and suggest further
requirements to select a final BOP. The local accuracy and global
transferability of the final BOP is also shown and compared to DFT.

<h3>Thermalization of a Disordered Interacting System under an Interaction  Quench</h3>

Although most studies of strongly correlated systems away from equilibrium
have focused on clean systems, it is well known that disorder may significantly
modify observed properties in various nontrivial ways. The nonequilibrium
interplay of interaction and disorder in these systems thus requires further
investigation. In the present paper, we use the recently developed
nonequilibrium DMFT+CPA embedding scheme, that combines both the dynamical mean
field theory (DMFT) and the coherent potential approximation (CPA)
nonequilibrium extensions, to characterize the relaxation and the
thermalization of a disordered interacting system described by the
Anderson-Hubbard model under an interaction quench. The system, initially in
equilibrium at a given temperature, has the interaction abruptly switched from
zero to a finite value at a given time. To investigate the role of disorder, we
use our effective medium approach to calculate, for different values of the
final interaction and of the disorder strength, the distribution functions as
the system evolves in time. This allows us to determine the effective
temperature after the quench and to analyze the effects of disorder on the
thermalization for various interaction strengths. We find that, for moderate
interactions after the interaction quench, disorder can tune the final
temperature of the system across a broad range of values with increased
disorder strength leading to lower effective temperature.

We discuss the evolution of high-order Van Hove singularities (hoVHSs) that
carry faster-than logarithmic divergences over a wide range of parameters in
cuprate-like electronic band dispersions. Numerical analysis gives insight into
the quantization of the VHS power-law-exponent pV and into transitions between
hoVHSs with different values of pV. The cuprates are found to lie in the
parameter regime where the amplitude of the hoVHS is not too large. Our study
indicates that the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity requires
simultaneous tuning of two different competing orders (antiferromagnetism and
the density wave associated with the hoVHS in cuprates), which is why it is so
rare.

The superconductor to insulator or metal transition in two dimensions (2D)
provides a valuable platform for studying continuous quantum phase transitions
(QPTs) and critical phenomena. Distinct theoretical models, including both
fermionic and bosonic localization scenarios, have been developed, but many
questions remain unsettled. The presence of an anomalous metal state near the
transition in various systems further enriches the field and challenges
existing theories. Using the Nernst effect, we uncover anomalous quantum
fluctuations and identify an unconventional superconducting quantum critical
point (QCP) in a gate-tuned excitonic quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), the
monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2). The observed vortex Nernst effect
reveals singular superconducting fluctuations in the resistive normal state
induced by magnetic fields or temperature, even well above the transition. Near
the doping-induced QCP, the Nernst signal driven by quantum fluctuations is
very large in the millikelvin regime, with a coefficient of ~ 4,100 uV/KT at
zero magnetic field, an indication of the proliferation of vortices. However,
the Nernst signal abruptly disappears when the doping is decreased below the
gate-tuned QPT, in striking conflict with expectations for a conventional QPT.
Our findings establish a 2D model platform for studying unconventional
superconducting QPTs and quantum critical matter.

<h3>Topological phase transitions, invariants and enriched bulk-edge  correspondences in fermionic gapless systems with extended Fermi surface</h3>

Topological phases and topological phase transitions (TPT) are among the most
fantastic phenomena in Nature. Here we show that injecting a current may lead
to new topological phases, especially new gapless topological metallic phases
with extended Fermi surfaces (FSs) through novel class of TPTs in the bulk or
the boundary. Specifically, we study the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) system in
a square lattice under various forms of injecting currents. In addition to the
previously known Chern insulator (which will be called even Chern insulator
here), band insulator and band metal (BM), we find three new topological phases
we name as: the gapped odd Chern insulator (Odd CI), the gapless odd Chern
metal (Odd CM) and even Chern metal (Even CM). The Chern number may not be
effective anymore in characterizing the topological gapless phases with
extended FS. It is the Hall conductance which acts as the new topological
invariant in such gapless systems. Its jump is a universal integer or
non-integer across the even CM/BM or odd CM/BM TPT respectively where there is
also a corresponding TPT in the Longitudinal (L-)edge modes. The Odd/even CM to
BM transition is a novel class of TPT without any non-analyticity in the ground
state energy density. This presents the first example of a TPT which is not a
quantum phase transition (QPT). The original bulk-edge correspondence is
enriched into bulk/Longitudinal (L-)/Transverse (T-) edge correspondence. The
L-edge reconstruction may happen earlier, later or at the same time as the bulk
TPT respectively in the even CI/odd CI/odd CM sequence with the edge dynamic
exponent $ z_L=3 $, in the even CI/even CM/odd CM sequence with $ z_L=2 $ or a
direct even CI/odd CM with a flat edge. The disappearance of the T-edge always
happen at the same time as the bulk TPT with a universal edge critical
behaviour.

Recently, near-ambient superconductivity has been experimentally evidenced in
a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride by Dasenbrock-Gammon \emph{et al.} [Nature
615, 244 (2023)], which yields a remarkable maximum $T_c$ of 294 K at just 10
kbar. However, due to the difficulty of x-ray diffraction (XRD) in identifying
light elements such as hydrogen and nitrogen, the crystal structure of the
superconductor remains elusive, in particular for the actual stoichiometry of
hydrogen and nitrogen and their atomistic positions. This holds even for its
parent structure. Here, we set out to address this issue by performing a
thorough density functional theory study on the structural, electronic,
dynamical, and optical properties of lutetium hydrides. Through thermal and
lattice dynamic analysis as well as XRD and superconductor color comparisons,
we unambiguously clarified that the parent structures are a mixture of dominant
LuH$_2$ phase of the CaF$_2$-type (instead of originally proposed LuH$_3$
structure of $Fm\bar{3}m$ space group) and minor LuH phase of the NaCl-type.

<h3>Stress-dependent activation entropy in thermally activated cross-slip of  dislocations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cross slip of screw dislocations in crystalline solids is a stress-driven
thermally activated process essential to many phenomena during plastic
deformation, including dislocation pattern formation, strain hardening, and
dynamic recovery. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has played an important
role in determining the microscopic mechanisms of cross slip. However, due to
its limited timescale, MD can only predict cross-slip rates in high-stress or
high-temperature conditions. The transition state theory can predict the
cross-slip rate over a broad range of stress and temperature conditions, but
its predictions have been found to be several orders of magnitude too low in
comparison to MD results. This discrepancy can be expressed as an anomalously
large activation entropy whose physical origin remains unclear. Here we resolve
this discrepancy by showing that the large activation entropy results from
anharmonic effects, including thermal softening, thermal expansion, and soft
vibrational modes of the dislocation. We expect these anharmonic effects to be
significant in a wide range of stress-driven thermally activated processes in
solids.

We study large deviations of the one-point height distribution,
$\mathcal{P}(H,T)$, of a stochastic interface, governed by the
Golubovi\'{c}-Bruinsma equation $$
\partial_{t}h=-\nu\partial_{x}^{4}h+\frac{\lambda}{2}\left(\partial_{x}h\right)^{2}+\sqrt{D}\,\xi(x,t)\,,
$$ where $h(x,t)$ is the interface height at point $x$ and time $t$, and
$\xi(x,t)$ is the Gaussian white noise. The interface is initially flat, and
$H$ is defined by the relation $h(x=0,t=T)=H$. Using the optimal fluctuation
method (OFM), we focus on the short-time limit. Here the typical fluctuations
of $H$ are Gaussian, and we evaluate the strongly asymmetric and non-Gaussian
tails of $\mathcal{P}(H,T)$. We show that the upper tail scales as $-\ln
\mathcal{P}(H,T) \sim H^{11/6}/T^{5/6}$. The lower tail, which scales as $-\ln
\mathcal{P}(H,T) \sim H^{5/2}/T^{1/2}$, coincides with its counterpart for the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and we uncover a simple physical mechanism behind
this universality. Finally, we verify our asymptotic results for the tails, and
compute the large deviation function of $H$, numerically.

We investigate the role of gap states in processes of perturbation
transmission along finite superconducting Kitaev chain. We look at this problem
on the general ground and use the formalism of non-stationary Greens functions,
which contain full information about the non-equilibrium and non stationary
properties of the system. We discuss tunneling current and non-stationary
transport properties of a finite Kitaev chain with each edge connected to its
own external lead. It is shown that the tunneling current is always
exponentially small for long chains. The time dependent behavior of the
tunneling current after the sudden change of bias voltage in one of the leads
is also obtained. We investigate the characteristic time of charge transfer
from the state at one end of the chain to the opposite edge state. We obtain
that this time always exponentially increases with the growth of the chain
length, and the relaxation time to the new equilibrium occupation number for
the localized state is very large. Our calculations are completely analytical
and straightforward, in contrast with many other methods. Obtained results show
how quickly the "second half" of Majorana state responds after external
perturbation acts on the "first half" and why "Majorana" states can hardly be
used for any practical devices that require signal transmission from one end of
the system to the other.

InAs/GaSb double quantum wells (QWs) separated by a 100 \AA\ AlSb middle
barrier are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We report a nanofabrication
technique that utilizes the surface Fermi level pinning position in InAs
$[E_f^s(\rm InAs)]$ for realizing independent electric contacts to each well.
In particular, separate ohmic contacts to the upper InAs quantum well are
achieved by selectively etching down to the InAs, while contacts to the lower
GaSb quantum well are obtained by the depletion method. For the latter, the
upper InAs quantum well is locally pinched off by top etched trenches capped
with a remaining 2-3 nm InAs layer. As a result of a relatively low $E_f^s(\rm
InAs)$, applying a negative bias gate potential will create a conducting hole
channel in GaSb, and hence a separate ohmic contact to the lower quantum well.
This method is demonstrated with experiment and the support of a
self-consistent band bending calculation. A number of experiments on separately
probing Coulomb and tunnel-coupled InAs/GaSb systems now become accessible.

We numerically analyze superconductivity (SC) in the cuprate superconductors
by using ab initio effective Hamiltonians consisting of the antibonding
combination of Cu $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O $2p_{\sigma}$ orbitals. We perform
variational Monte Carlo calculations for the four carrier doped cuprates with
diverse experimental optimal SC critical temperature $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$:
CaCuO$_2$ ($T_{c}^{\rm opt} \sim 110$ K), Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_6$ ($T_{c}^{\rm opt}
\sim 10$-$40$ K), Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ ($T_{c}^{\rm opt} \sim 85$-$100$
K), and HgBa$_2$CuO$_4$ ($T_{c}^{\rm opt} \sim 90$ K). Materials and hole
doping concentration ($\delta$) dependencies of the SC order parameter $F_{\rm
SC}$ and the competition with spin/charge order show essential and quantitative
agreements with the available experiments in the following points: (1) The
ground state is commonly the SC state, which is severely competing with the
charge/spin stripe and antiferromagnetic states. (2) $F_{\rm SC}$ shows
amplitude consistent with the superfluid density measured in the muon spin
resonance and its dome structure found in $\delta$ dependence shows consistency
with that of the SC gap in the tunneling and photoemission measurements. We
further find insights into the universal SC mechanism: (I) $F_{\rm SC}$
increases with the ratio $U/|t_1|$, indicating that $U/|t_1|$ is the principal
component controlling the SC. Here, $U$ and $t_1$ are the onsite Coulomb

<h3>Exciton-Plasmon Coupling Mediated Superior Photoresponse in 2D Hybrid  Phototransistors</h3>

The possibility of creating heterostructure of two-dimensional (2D) materials
has emerged as a viable route towards realizing novel optoelectronic devices.
However, the low light absorption due to their small absorption cross section,
limits their realistic application. While light-matter interaction mediated by
strong exciton-plasmon coupling has been demonstrated to improve absorbance and
spontaneous emission in a coupled TMDC and metallic nanostructures, the
fabrication of tunable broadband phototransistor with high quantum yield is
still a challenging task. By synthesizing Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) capped with
a thin layer of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) through chemical route, we report a
lithography-free fabrication of a large area broadband superior gate-tunable
hybrid phototransistor based on monolayer graphene decorated by WS$_2$-Ag NPs
in a three-terminal device configuration. The fabricated device exhibits
extremely high photoresponsivity (up to $3.2\times 10^4$ A/W) which is more
than 5 times higher than the bare graphene/WS$_2$ hybrid device, along with a
low noise equivalent power (NEP) (~10$^{-13}$ W/Hz$^{0.5}$, considering 1/f
noise) and high specific detectivity ~1010 Jones in the wide (325-730 nm)
wavelength region. The additional PVP capping of Ag NPs helps to suppress the
direct charge and heat transfer and most importantly, increases the device
stability by preventing the degradation of WS$_2$-Ag hybrid system. The
enhanced optical properties of the hybrid device are explained via dipole
mediated strong exciton-plasmon coupling, corroborated by COMSOL Multiphysics
simulation. Our work demonstrates a strategy towards obtaining an
environment-friendly, scalable, high-performance broadband phototransistor by
tuning the exciton-plasmon coupling for new generation opto-electronic devices.

<br>
<br>
Experimental insight in the nanoscale dynamics underlying switching in novel
memristive devices is limited owing to the scarcity of techniques that can
probe the electronic structure of these devices. Scattering scanning near-field
optical microscopy is a relatively novel approach to probe the optical response
of materials with a spatial resolution well below the diffraction limit. We use
this non-invasive tool to demonstrate that it provides detailed information on
the origin and memory behaviour of ultra-thin films of vanadium dioxide.
Simultaneously recorded $I(V)$ characteristics and near-field maps show that
discontinuities in the I(V) characteristics arise from the sudden switching of
insulating domains to metallic domains. At the threshold voltage, the domains
form a continuous current path. The metallic domains persist once the bias
voltage is removed, but narrow monoclinic regions appear around the domain
boundaries. The key advantage of our approach is that it provides detailed
information on the electronic structure at length scales raging from tens of
nanometers up to tens of microns and is easily applied under \textit{in
operando} conditions.

We thank G.P. Mikitik and Yu.V. Sharlai for contributing this note and the
cordial exchange about it. First and foremost, we note that the aim of our
paper is to report a methodology to diagnose topological (semi)metals using
magnetic quantum oscillations. Thus far, such diagnosis has been based on the
phase offset of quantum oscillations, which is extracted from a "Landau fan
plot". A thorough analysis of the Onsager-Lifshitz-Roth quantization rules has
shown that the famous $\pi$-phase shift can equally well arise from orbital- or
spin magnetic moments in topologically trivial systems with strong spin-orbit
coupling or small effective masses. Therefore, the "Landau fan plot" does not
by itself constitute a proof of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. In
the paper at hand, we report an improved analysis method that exploits the
strong energy-dependence of the effective mass in linearly dispersing bands.
This leads to a characteristic temperature dependence of the oscillation
frequency which is a strong indicator of nontrivial topology, even for
multi-band metals with complex Fermi surfaces. Three materials, Cd$_3$As$_2$,
Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and LaRhIn$_5$ served as test cases for this method. Linear band
dispersions were detected for Cd$_3$As$_2$, as well as the $F$ $\approx$ 7 T
pocket in LaRhIn$_5$.

The lutetium dihydride LuH2 is stable at ambient conditions. Here we show
that its color undergoes sequential changes from dark blue at ambient pressure
to pink at ~2.2 GPa and then to bright red at ~4 GPa upon compression in a
diamond anvil cell. Such a pressure-induced color change in LuH2 is reversible
and it is very similar to that recently reported in the N-doped lutetium
hydride. However, our preliminary resistance measurements on LuH2 under
pressures up to 7.7 GPa evidenced no superconductivity down to 1.5 K.

<br>
<br>
The recent application of topological quantum chemistry to rhombohedral
bismuth established the non-trivial band structure of this material. This is a
2$^{nd}$order topological insulator characterized by the presence of
topology-imposed hinge-states. The spatial distribution of hinge-states and the
possible presence of additional symmetry-protected surface-states is expected
to depend on the crystal shape and symmetries. To explore this issue, we have
grown bismuth nanocrystals in the tens of nanometers on the $(110)$ surface of
InAs. By scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we mapped the local density of states
on all facets and identified the presence of the hinge-states at the
intersection of all facets. Our study confirm the classification of bulk
bismuth as a 2$^{nd}$order topological insulator. We propose that the
ubiquitous presence of the hinge-states result from their tunnel-coupling
across the nanometer-sized facets.

<h3>Unusual magnetic hysteresis and transition between vortex to double pole  states arising from interlayer coupling in diamond shaped nanostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Controlling the magnetic ground states at the nanoscale is a long-standing
basic research problem and an important issue in magnetic storage technologies.
Here, we designed a nanostructured material that exhibits very unusual
hysteresis loops due to a transition between vortex and double pole states.
Arrays of 700 nm diamond-shape nanodots consisting of Py(30 nm)/Ru(tRu)/Py(30
nm) (Py, permalloy (Ni80Fe20)) trilayers were fabricated by interference
lithography and e-beam evaporation. We show that varying the Ru interlayer
spacer thickness (tRu) governs the interaction between the Py layers. We found
this interaction mainly mediated by two mechanisms: magnetostatic interaction
that favors antiparallel (antiferromagnetic, AFM) alignment of the Py layers
and exchange interaction that oscillates between ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM
couplings. For a certain range of Ru thicknesses, FM coupling dominates and
forms magnetic vortices in the upper and lower Py layers. For Ru thicknesses at
which AFM coupling dominates, the magnetic state in remanence is a double pole
structure. Our results showed that the interlayer exchange coupling interaction
remains finite even at 4 nm Ru thickness. The magnetic states in remanence,
observed by Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), are in good agreement with
corresponding hysteresis loops obtained by Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) and
micromagnetic simulations.

<h3>Data-Driven Statistical Reduced-Order Modeling and Quantification of  Polycrystal Mechanics Leading to Porosity-Based Ductile Damage</h3>

<br>

Predicting the process of porosity-based ductile damage in polycrystalline
metallic materials is an essential practical topic. Ductile damage and its
precursors are represented by extreme values in stress and material state
quantities, the spatial PDF of which are highly non-Gaussian with strong fat
tails. Traditional deterministic forecasts using physical models often fail to
capture the statistics of structural evolution during material deformation.
This study proposes a data-driven statistical reduced-order modeling framework
to provide a probabilistic forecast of the deformation process leading to
porosity-based ductile damage, with uncertainty quantification. The framework
starts with computing the time evolution of the leading moments of specific
state variables from full-field polycrystal simulations. Then a sparse model
identification algorithm based on causation entropy, including essential
physical constraints, is used to discover the governing equations of these
moments. An approximate solution of the time evolution of the PDF is obtained
from the predicted moments exploiting the maximum entropy principle. Numerical
experiments based on polycrystal realizations show that the model can
characterize the time evolution of the non-Gaussian PDF of the von Mises stress
and quantify the probability of extreme events. The learning process also
reveals that the mean stress interacts with higher-order moments and extreme
events in a strongly nonlinear and multiplicative fashion. In addition, the
calibrated moment equations provide a reasonably accurate forecast when applied
to the realizations outside the training data set, indicating the robustness of
the model and the skill for extrapolation. Finally, an information-based
measurement shows that the leading four moments are sufficient to characterize
the crucial non-Gaussian features throughout the entire deformation history.

I consider relaxation of the pairing amplitude in a disordered s-wave
superconductor in the absence of the two-particle collisions. My main
assumption is that disorder scattering rate is much smaller than the value of
the superconducting energy gap. I use Keldysh technique to derive a system of
nonlinear equations which describe the relaxation of the pairing amplitude
following a quench of the pairing strength. I find that in a superconductor
contaminated with paramagnetic impurities, for small deviations from
equilibrium the pairing amplitude in a steady state varies periodically with
time. It is shown that such a steady state emerges due to scattering on
paramagnetic impurities which pushes the frequency of the amplitude mode below
the the edge of the continuum spectrum of states.

<h3>Polynomial functions for direct calculation of the surface free energy  developed from the Neumann Equation of State method</h3>

The Neumann Equation of State (EQS) allows obtaining the value of the surface
free energy of a solid {\gamma}_{SV} from the contact angle ({\theta}) of a
probe liquid with known surface tension {\gamma}_{LV}. The value of
{\gamma}_{SV} is obtained by numerical methods solving the corresponding EQS.
In this work, we analyzed the discrepancies between the values of {\gamma}_SV
obtained using the three versions of the EQS reported in the literature. The
condition number of the different EQS was used to analyze their sensitivity to
the uncertainty in the {\theta} values. Polynomials fit to one of these
versions of EQS are proposed to obtain values of {\gamma}_{SV} directly from
contact angles ({\gamma}_SV ({\theta})) of particular probe liquids. Finally, a
general adjusted polynomial is presented to obtain the values of {\gamma}_{SV}
not restricted to a particular probe liquid
({\gamma}_{SV}({\theta},{\gamma}_{LV})). Results showed that the three versions
of EQS present non-negligible discrepancies, especially at high values of
{\theta}. The sensitivity of the EQS to the uncertainty in the values of
{\theta} is very similar in the three versions and depends on the probe liquid
used (greater sensitivity at higher {\gamma}_{LV}) and on the value of
{\gamma}_{SV} of the solid (greater sensitivity at lower {\gamma}_{SV}). The
discrepancy of the values obtained by numerical resolution of both the
fifth-order fit polynomials and the general fit polynomial was low, no larger
than {\pm}0.40 mJ/m^{2}. The polynomials obtained allow the analysis and
propagation of the uncertainty of the input variables in the determination of
{\gamma}_{SV} in a simple and fast way.

<h3>Surface step induced bending in two-dimensional oxide nanosheet</h3>

The surface steps play dramatic roles in surface dominated processes and the
related properties, in which these roles would be significantly enhanced for
the low-dimensional nano or quantum materials since the ratio of surface atoms
is largely increased. However, the atomic structures of surface steps in the
nano/quantum systems are poorly understood because it is extremely difficult to
controllably introduce these defects experimentally. Here, by utilizing the
focused sub-Angstrom high energy electron beam induced atomic precise etching
in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we fabricate MgO
two-dimensional (100) nanosheet as thin as 2 atomic layers, and controllably
introduced the surface steps in the nanosheet. It is found that the surface
steps could bend the MgO nanosheet and such step-induced bending becomes more
pronounced for the nanosheet with less layer numbers. We reveal that the
bending of the nanosheets is originated from the step induced step force and
the reduced bending stiffness in the nanosheet system.

<h3>Capillary filling of polymer chains in nanopores</h3>

<br>
<br>
We performed molecular dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model to
investigate the capillary filling dynamics of polymer chains in nanopores.
Short chains fill slower than predicted by the Lucas-Washburn equation but long
chains fill faster. The analysis shows that the combination of the confinement
effect on the free energy of chains and the reduction of the effective radius
due to the "dead zone" slow down the imbibition. Reduction of the entanglements
is the main factor behind the reversing dynamics because of the lower effective
viscosity, which leads to a faster filling. This effect is enhanced in the
smaller capillary and more profound for longer chains. The observed increase in
the mean square radius of gyration during capillary filling provides a clear
evidence of chain orientation, which leads to the decrease in the number of
entanglements. For the scaling relation between the effective viscosity and the
degree of polymerization, we find the exponent will increase in the larger
nanopore.

Helical edge states in topological insulators give counterpropagating spin
current on the two parallel edges. We here propose anti-helical edge states of
magnons in patterned antiferromagnetic thin films, which host copropagating
spin current on the two parallel edges, where the two magnon modes with
opposite chirality act like the spin. The embedded heavy metal dot array in the
thin film induces interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (iDMIs),
drives the magnon bands into nontrivial topological phases, characterized by
spin Chern number. The resulting helical edge modes lead to spin current with
the direction dependent on the sign of iDMI parameter. In a strip geometry, we
combine two subsystems with two embedded metal dot arrays, which give opposite
iDMI parameters. Anti-helical edge states emerge, compensated by the
counterpropagating bulk confined states. Helical and anti-helical edge states
are verified by the micromagnetic simulations. Our work is quite helpful in the
field of magnon spintronics based on antiferromagnets.

This study calculated the magnetoresistance (MR) in the Dirac electron
system, Dressellhaus-Kip-Kittel (DKK) model, and nodal-line semimetals based on
the semiclassical Boltzmann theory, with particular focus on the detailed
energy dispersion structure. The negative off-diagonal effective-mass was found
to induce negative transverse MR owing to the energy dispersion effect. The
impact of the off-diagonal mass was more prominent in case of a linear energy
dispersion. Further, Dirac electron systems could realize negative MR even if
the Fermi surface was perfectly spherical. The obtained negative MR in the DKK
model may explain the long-standing mystery in p-type Si.

rule approach can accurately determine the frequency of the low energy axial
excitation, using properties of the droplet obtained from the ground state
solutions. This excitation corresponds to an oscillation in the length of the
filament-shaped droplet. Additionally, we evaluate the static polarizabilities,
which quantify change in the droplet dimensions in response to a change in
harmonic confinement.

The transport and optical properties of the Nb-doped
Cs(V$_{1-x}$Nb$_{x}$)$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ with x = 0.03 and 0.07 have been
investigated and compared with those of the undoped CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Upon Nb
doping, the charge-density wave (CDW) transition temperature $T_{\text{CDW}}$
is suppressed, and the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$ rises. The residual
resistivity ratio decreases with Nb doping, suggesting an increase of disorder.
For all compounds, the optical conductivity in the pristine phase reveals two
Drude components (D1 and D2). The substitution of Nb causes an increase of D1
alongside a reduction of D2 in weight, which implies a change of the Fermi
surface. The total Drude weight is reduced with increasing Nb content,
signifying an enhancement of electronic correlations. Below $T_{\text{CDW}}$,
while the optical conductivity clearly manifests the CDW gap in all materials,
the gapped portion of the Fermi surface shrinks as the Nb content grows. A
comprehensive analysis indicates that the change of the Fermi surface, the
enhancement of electronic correlations, the shrinkage of the removed Fermi
surface by the CDW gap, and the increase of disorder may all have a
considerable impact on the interplay between the CDW and superconductivity in
Cs(V$_{1-x}$Nb$_{x}$)$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.

Two-dimensional materials-based field-effect transistors (2DM-FETs) exhibit
both ambipolar and unipolar transport types. To physically and compactly cover
both cases, we put forward a quasi-Fermi-level phase space (QFLPS) approach to
model the ambipolar effect in our previous work. This work aims to further
improve the QFLPS model's numerical aspect so that the model can be implanted
into the standard circuit simulator. We first rigorously derive the
integral-free formula for the drain-source current to achieve this goal. It is
more friendly to computation than the integral form. Besides, it explicitly
gives the correlation terms between the electron and hole components. Secondly,
to work out the boundary values required by the new expressions, we develop a
fast evaluation algorithm for the surface electrostatic potential based on the
zero-temperature limit property of the 2DM-FET system. By calibrating the model
with the realistic device data of black phosphorus (BP) and monolayer
molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS2) FETs, the completed algorithm is tested against
practical cases. The results show a typical superiority to the benchmark
algorithm by two orders of magnitude in time consumption can be achieved while
keeping a high accuracy with 7 to 9 significant digits.

Using a pure electric current to control kagome non-collinear
anti-ferromagnets is expected to be superior to ferromagnets and
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric anti-ferromagnets in information storage and
processing. However, a full description of the magnetic dynamics of the
non-collinear anti-ferromagnetism driven by a pure electric current is still
lacking, in particular, on intrinsic (i.e., without using external magnetic
fields or external spin currents) spin-orbit torques. In this work, by
assembling multiple microscopic models and theoretical approaches, we
self-consistently describe the relations among the electronic structure,
magnetic structure, spin accumulations, and intrinsic spin-orbit torques, in
the magnetic dynamics of a non-collinear anti-ferromagnet driven by a pure
electric current. Our calculation can yield a critical current density
comparable with those in the experiments. The full description will be helpful
for future applications of non-collinear anti-ferromagnets.

The Wiedemann-Franz law and Mott relation are textbook paradigms on the
ratios of the thermal and thermoelectric conductivities to electrical
conductivity, respectively. Deviations from them usually reveal insights for
intriguing phases of matter. The recent topological kagome magnets
TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and Mn$_3$Ge show confusingly opposite derivations in the Hall
measurement. We calculate the topological and disorder corrections to the
Wiedemann-Franz law and Mott relation for the Hall responses in topological
kagome magnets. The calculation indicates the dominance of the topological
correction in the experiments. More importantly, we derive analytic correction
formulas, which can universally capture the two opposite experiments with the
chemical potential as the only parameter and will be a powerful guidance for
future explorations on the magnetic topological matter.

We classify Hermitian tight-binding models describing noninteracting
electrons on a one-dimensional periodic lattice with two energy bands. To do
this, we write a generalized Rice-Mele model with two orbitals per unit cell,
including all possible complex-valued long-range hoppings consistent with
Hermicity. We then apply different forms of time-reversal, charge-conjugation
and chiral symmetry in order to constrain the parameters, resulting in an array
of possible models in different symmetry classes. For each symmetry class, we
define a single, canonical form of the Hamiltonian and identify models that are
related to the canonical form by an off-diagonal unitary transformation in the
atomic basis. The models have either symmorphic or nonsymmorphic nonspatial
symmetries (time $T$, chiral and charge-conjugation). The nonsymmorphic
category separates into two types of state of matter: an insulator with a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index in the absence of nonsymmorphic time-reversal
symmetry or, in the presence of nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry, a
metallic state. The latter is an instance of Kramer's degeneracy with one
degeneracy point in the Brillouin zone as opposed to no degeneracy points in
symmorphic systems with $T^2 = 1$ and two in symmorphic systems with $T^2 = -
1$.

Quantum skyrmionic phase is modelled in a 2D helical spin lattice. This
topological skyrmionic phase retains its nature in a large parameter space
before moving to a ferromagnetic phase. Next nearest-neighbour interaction
improves the stability and it also causes a shift of the topological phase in
the parameter space. Nonanalytic behaviour of the rate function observed, when
the system which is initially in a quantum skyrmion phase is quenched to a
trivial quantum ferromagnetic phase, indicates a dynamical quantum phase
transition. Dynamical quantum phase transition is absent when the system
initially in a skyrmion phase is quenched to a helical phase.

Understanding and mastering the mechanical properties of metallic

properties of such nanoobjects are driven by their size but, above all, by
their shape. This outcome was achieved by introducing a descriptor in the
analysis of our results enabling to distinguish among the different
nanoparticle shapes studied in the present work. In addition, other
transition-metal nanoparticles have been considered (copper and platinum) using
the aforementioned approach. The same strong dependence of the elastic
properties with the shape was revealed, thus highlighting the universal
character of our achievements.

Controlled generation of coherent spin waves with the highest possible
frequencies and the shortest possible wavelengths is a cornerstone of
spintronics and magnonics. Here, using the Heisenberg antiferromagnet
RbMnF$_3$, we demonstrate that laser-induced THz spin dynamics corresponding to
pairs of the mutually coherent counter propagating spin waves with the
wavevectors up to the edge of the Brillouin zone cannot be understood in the
terms of magnetization and antiferromagnetic vectors, conventionally used to
describe spin waves in the classical macrospin approximation. Instead, we
propose to model such a spin dynamics using the spin correlations function. We
derive quantum-mechanical equation of motion for the latter and emphasize that
unlike the magnetization and the antiferromagnetic vectors the spin
correlations in antiferromagnets do not have an inertia.

<br>
<br>
Skutterudites are crystals with a cage-like structure that can be augmented
with filler atoms ("rattlers"), usually leading to a reduction in thermal
conductivity that can be exploited for thermoelectric applications. Here, we
leverage the recently introduced Wigner formulation of thermal transport to
elucidate the microscopic physics underlying heat conduction in skutterudites,
showing that filler atoms can drive a crossover from the Boltzmann to the
Wigner regimes of thermal transport, i.e., from particle-like conduction to
wave-like tunnelling. At temperatures where the thermoelectric efficiency of
skutterudites is largest, wave-like tunneling can become comparable to
particle-like propagation. We define a Boltzmann deviation descriptor able to
differentiate the two regimes and relate the competition between the two
mechanisms to the materials' chemistry, providing a design strategy to select
rattlers and identify optimal compositions for thermoelectric applications.

This article reports the modeling of inertial rotational Brownian motion as
an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process evolving on the cotangent bundle of the rotation
group, SO(3). The benefit of this approach and the use of a different
parameterization of rotations allows the handling of particles with arbitrary
shapes, without requiring any simplifying assumptions on the shape or the
structure of the viscosity tensors. The resultant Fokker-Planck equation for
the joint orientation and angular momentum probability distribution can be
solved approximately using an `ansatz' Gaussian distribution in exponential
coordinates.

<h3>Experimental investigation of the effect of topological insulator on the  magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic metal: $BiSbTe_{1.5}Se_{1.5}$ and  $Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$ heterostructure</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have studied ferromagnetic metal/topological insulator bilayer system to
understand magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic metal (FM) in contact with a
topological insulator (TI). At magnetic resonance condition, the precessing
magnetization in the metallic ferromagnet ($Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$) injects spin
current into the topological insulator ($BiSbTe_{1.5}Se_{1.5}$), a phenomenon
known as spin-pumping. Due to the spin pumping effect, fast relaxation in the
ferromagnet results in the broadening of ferromagnetic resonance linewidth
($\Delta H$). We evaluated the parameters like effective Gilbert damping
coefficient ($\alpha_{eff}$), spin-mixing conductance ($g_{eff}^{\uparrow
\downarrow}$) and spin current density ($j_S^0$) to confirm a successful spin
injection due to spin-pumping into the $BiSbTe_{1.5}Se_{1.5}$ layer. TIs embody
a spin-momentum locked surface state that span the bulk band-gap. It can act
differently to the FM magnetization than the other normal metals. To probe the
effect of topological surface state, a systematic low temperature study is
crucial as surface state of TI dominates at lower temperatures. The exponential
growth of $\Delta H$ for all different thickness combination of FM/TI bilayers
and effective Gilbert damping coefficient ($\alpha_{eff}$) with lowering
temperature confirms the prediction that spin chemical bias generated from
spin-pumping induces surface current in TI due to spin-momentum locking. The
hump-like feature of magnetic anisotropy field ($H_K$)of the bilayer around 60K
suggests that the decrease of interfacial in-plane magnetic anisotropy can
result from exchange coupling between the TI surface state and the local
moments of FM layer.

Chirality transfer from the level of molecular structure up to mesoscopic
lengthscales of supramolecular morphologies is a broad and persistent theme in
self-assembled soft materials, from biological to synthetic matter. Here, we
analyze the mechanism of chirality transfer in a prototypical self-assembly
system, block copolymers (BCPs), in particular, its impact on one of the most
complex and functionally vital phases: the cubic, triply-periodic, gyroid
network. Motivated by recent experimental studies, we consider a
self-consistent field model of ABC* triblock copolymers possessing an end-block
of chain chemistry and examine the interplay between chirality at the scale of
networks, in alternating double network phases, and the patterns of segmental
order within tubular network domains. We show that while segments in gyroids
exhibit twist in both polar and nematic segmental order parameters, the
magnitude of net nematic twist is generically much larger than polar twist, and
more surprising, {\it reverses handedness} relative to the sense of polar order
as well as the sense of dihedral twist of the network. Careful analysis of the
intra-domain nematic order reveals that this unique chirality transfer
mechanism relies on the strongly biaxial nature of segmental order in BCP
networks and relates the {\it biaxial twist} to complex patterns of frame
rotation of the principal directors in the intra-domain texture. Finally, we
show that this mechanism of twist reversal leads to chirality selection of
alternating gyroid networks in ABC* triblocks, in the limit of very weak
chirality .

Existence of Anderson localization is considered a manifestation of coherence
of classical and quantum waves in disordered systems. Signatures of
localization have been observed in condensed matter and cold atomic systems
where the coupling to the environment can be significantly suppressed but not
eliminated. In this work we explore the phenomena of localization in random
Lindbladian dynamics describing open quantum systems. We propose a model of
one-dimensional chain of non-interacting, spinless fermions coupled to a local
ensemble of baths. The jump operator mediating the interaction with the bath
linked to each site has a power-law tail with an exponent $p$. We show that the
steady state of the system undergoes a localization entanglement phase
transition by tuning $p$ which remains stable in the presence of coherent
hopping. Unlike the entanglement transition in the quantum trajectories of open
systems, this transition is exhibited by the averaged steady state density
matrix of the Lindbladian. The steady state in the localized phase is
characterised by a heterogeneity in local population imbalance, while the jump
operators exhibit a constant participation ratio of the sites they affect. Our
work provides a novel realisation of localization physics in open quantum
systems.

We explain how to apply a Gaussian-preserving operator to a fermionic
Gaussian state. We use this method to study the evolution of the entanglement
entropy of an Ising spin chain following a Lindblad dynamics with string
measurement operators, focusing on the quantum-jump unraveling of such
Lindbladian. We find that the asymptotic entanglement entropy obeys an area law
for finite-range string operators and a volume law for ranges of the string
which scale with the system size. The same behavior is observed for the
measurement-only dynamics, suggesting that measurements can play a leading role
in this context.

Stressed soft materials commonly present viscoelastic signatures in the form
of power-law or exponential decay. Understanding the origins of such rheologic
behaviors is crucial to find proper technological applications. Using an
elastic network model of macromolecules immersed in a viscous fluid, we
numerically reproduce those characteristic viscoelastic relaxations and show
how the microscopic interactions determine the rheologic response. We find that
exponential relaxations are indeed the most common behavior. However, power
laws may arise when drag forces between the macromolecules and the fluid are
sublinear, which is related to micro-deformations of the macromolecules.

We show through simulations of amorphous solids prepared in open boundary
conditions that they possess significantly fewer low-frequency vibrational
modes compared to their periodic boundary counterparts. Specifically, using
measurements of the vibrational density of states, we find that the universal
$D(\omega) \sim \omega^4$ law changes to $D(\omega) \sim \omega^\delta$ with
$\delta \approx 5$ in two dimensions and $\delta \approx 4.5$ in three
dimensions. Crucially, this enhanced stability is achieved when utilizing slow
annealing protocols to generate solid configurations. We perform an anharmonic
analysis of the minima corresponding to the lowest-frequency modes in such
open-boundary systems and discuss their correlation with the density of states.
A study of various system sizes further reveals that small systems display a
higher degree of localization in vibrations. Lastly, we confine open-boundary
solids in order to introduce macroscopic stresses in the system which are
absent in the unconfined system, and find that the $D(\omega) \sim \omega^4$
behavior is recovered.

Hole-spin qubits in semiconductors represent a mature platform for quantum
technological applications. Here we consider their use as sensors of the
electrostatic environment, and specifically for estimating the distance from
the qubit of an external charge. Different approaches are considered -- based
on the use of single or double quantum dots, ground and out-of-equilibrium
states, Rabi and Ramsey measurements -- and comparatively analyzed by means of
the classical and quantum Fisher information. Detailed quantitative aspects
result from the multiband character of the hole states, which we account for
within a multiband approach. Beyond this, general conclusions can be drawn on
the relative efficiency of the above options, and analytical expressions are
derived for the Fisher information of a generic qubit within the Rabi and
Ramsey schemes.

Thermoelectrical properties are frequently used to characterize the materials
and endow the free energy from wasted heat for useful purposes. Here, we show
that linear thermoelectric effects in tunnel junctions (TJs) with Fe-based
superconductors, not only address the dominance between particle and hole
states, but even provide information about the superconducting order parameter
symmetry. In particular, we observe that nodal order parameters present a
maximal thermoelectric effect at lower temperatures than for nodeless cases.
Finally, we show that superconducting TJs between iron-based and BCS
superconductors could provide a thermoelectric efficiency ZT exceeding 6 with a
linear Seebeck coefficient around $S\approx 800\;\mu\text{V/K}$ at a few
Kelvin. These results pave the way to novel thermoelectric machines based on
multi-band superconductors.

Led by the rise of the internet of things, the world is experiencing
exponential growth of generated data. Data-driven algorithms such as signal
processing and artificial neural networks are required to process and extract
meaningful information from it. They are, however, seriously limited by the
traditional von-Neuman architecture with physical separation between processing
and memory, motivating the development of in-memory computing. This emerging
architecture is gaining attention by promising more energy-efficient computing
on edge devices. In the past few years, two-dimensional materials have entered
the field as a material platform suitable for realizing efficient memory
elements for in-memory architectures. Here, we report a large-scale integrated
32x32 vector-matrix multiplier with 1024 floating-gate field-effect transistors
(FGFET) that use monolayer MoS2 as the channel material. In our wafer-scale
fabrication process, we achieve a high yield and low device-to-device
variability, which are prerequisites for practical applications. A statistical
analysis shows the potential for multilevel and analog storage with a single
programming pulse, allowing our accelerator to be programmed using an efficient
open-loop programming scheme. Next, we demonstrate reliable, discrete signal
processing in a highly parallel manner. Our findings set the grounds for
creating the next generation of in-memory processors and neural network
accelerators that can take advantage of the full benefits of semiconducting van
der Waals materials for non-von Neuman computing.

Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are soft phase-changing solids that exhibit
large reversible contractions upon heating, Goldstone-like soft modes and
resultant microstructural instabilities. We heat a planar LCE slab to
isotropic, clamp the lower surface then cool back to nematic. Clamping prevents
macroscopic elongation, producing compression and microstructure. We see that
the free surface destabilizes, adopting topography with amplitude and
wavelength similar to thickness. To understand the instability, we numerically
compute the microstructural relaxation of a "non-ideal" LCE energy. Linear
stability reveals a Biot-like scale-free instability, but with oblique
wavevector. However, simulation and experiment show that, unlike classic
elastic creasing, instability culminates in a cross-hatch without cusps or
hysteresis, and is constructed entirely from low-stress soft modes.

<h3>Lower (negative) bounds on the static electric susceptibility of  non-equilibrium cubic crystals</h3>

We use a classical, microscopic model of point-like dipolarizable entities (a
model that is standard in the case of positive polarizability) and investigate
its behavior for simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and
face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals with one entity per primitive cell when the
static polarizability of the entities is negative and the mutual interaction
between the entities is taken into account. We find that the static electric
susceptibility is bounded below due to an instability towards self-polarization
but the lower permissible bound is negative definite in each case, i.e., the
concept of negative static electric susceptibility remains robust, according to
the model, when mutual interactions are taken into account. The usual
Clausius-Mossotti relation between the static polarizability and the static
electric susceptibility remains valid in the case of negative parameters, but
only down to the lower permissible bound; the value of the bound depends on the
crystal structure and is always unrelated to the asymptote of the
Clausius-Mossotti curve. The lower permissible bounds of the static electric
susceptibility are found to be -0.906 for sc, and -1.00 for bcc and fcc. These
results confirm that, although the magnitude of the static electric
susceptibility does not diverge in the negative case (as it can in the positive
case), the magnitudes attainable in the negative case for condensed media may,
nevertheless, be many orders of magnitude greater than those predicted
previously for inverted vapors and gases. This is a promising result in
relation to the development of potential new technologies that exploit the
phenomenon.

<h3>Impact of polyelectrolyte adsorption on the rheology of concentrated  Poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide) microgel suspensions</h3>

<i>Rajam Elancheliyan, Edouard Chauveau, Domenico Truzzolillo</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the impact of three water-soluble polyelectrolytes (PEs) on the
flow of concentrated suspensions of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)
microgels with thermoresponsive anionic charge density. By progressively adding
the PEs to a jammed suspension of swollen microgels, we show that the rheology
of the mixtures is remarkably influenced by the sign of the PE charge, PE
concentration and hydrophobicity only when the temperature is raised above the
microgel volume phase transition temperature $T_c$, namely when microgels
collapse, they are partially hydrophobic and form a volume-spanning colloidal
gel. We find that the original gel is strengthened close to the isoelectric
point, attained when microgels are mixed with cationic PEs, while PE
hydrophobicity rules the gel strengthening at very high PE concentrations.
Surprisingly, we find that polyelectrolyte adsorption or partial embedding of
PE chains inside the microgel periphery occurs also when anionic polymers of
polystyrene sulfonate with high degree of sulfonation are added. This gives
rise to colloidal stabilization and to the melting of the original gel network
above $T_c$. Contrastingly, the presence of polyelectrolytes in suspensions of
swollen, jammed microgels results in a weak softening of the original repulsive
glass, even when an apparent isoelectric condition is met. Our study puts
forward the crucial role of electrostatics in thermosensitive microgels,
unveiling an exciting new way to tailor the flow of these soft colloids and
highlighting a largely unexplored path to engineer soft colloidal mixtures.

The Sand Hypoplastic (SH) constitutive law by von Wolffersdorff (1996) is a
interesting hypoplastic model for soil mechanics. This model includes eight
parameters, usually calibrated using the oedometric (OE) and the drained
isotropically consolidated triaxial tests (CD). However, previous studies show
that the SH model calibration in the CD test has conflicting requirements in
predicting the evolution of stresses and strains.
In this work, we study the SH model calibration over a wide range of testing
conditions using 12 OE and 25 CD tests by Wichtmann and Triantafyllidis (2016)
on the Karlsruhe sands. The parameter space is extensively explored via Genetic
Algorithm Optimization (GA) using the recently developed open-source software
GA-cal (available at \url{https://github.com/FraJoMen/GA-cal}). This
exploration allowed us to study the SH model's predictive limits and to
identify, using a multi-objective analysis, the main parameters governing the
compromise between the accurate prediction of stresses versus strain in the CD
tests.

The order from quantum disorder (OFQD) phenomenon was first discovered in
quantum spin systems in geometric frustrated lattice. Similar phenomenon was
also discovered in interacting bosonic systems or quantum spin systems with
spin-orbit coupling in a bipartite lattice. Here we show that the OFQD also
leads to a topological phase transition. We demonstrate this new connection in
the experimentally realized weakly interacting Quantum Anomalous Hall system of
spinor bosons in an optical lattice. There are two classes of topological
phenomena: the first class is a perturbative one smoothly connected to the
non-interacting limit. The second one is a non-perturbative one which has no
analog in the non-interacting limit. Their experimental detections are also
discussed.

The kagome superconductor family AV3Sb5 (A=Cs, K, Rb) emerged as an exciting
platform to study exotic Fermi surface instabilities. Here we use
spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to reveal how the surprising cascade of
higher and lower-dimensional density waves in CsV3Sb5 is intimately tied to a
set of small reconstructed Fermi pockets. ARPES measurements visualize the
formation of these pockets generated by a 3D charge density wave transition.
The pockets are connected by dispersive q* wave vectors observed in Fourier
transforms of STM differential conductance maps. As the additional 1D charge
order emerges at a lower temperature, q* wave vectors become substantially
renormalized, signaling further reconstruction of the Fermi pockets.
Remarkably, in the superconducting state, the superconducting gap modulations
give rise to an in-plane Cooper pair-density-wave at the same q* wave vectors.
Our work demonstrates the intrinsic origin of the charge-stripes and the
pair-density-wave in CsV3Sb5 and their relationship to the Fermi pockets. These
experiments uncover a unique scenario of how Fermi pockets generated by a
parent charge density wave state can provide a favorable platform for the
emergence of additional density waves.

The interplay of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom presents an
outstanding problem in condensed matter physics and chemistry. Computational
challenges arise especially for large systems, long time scales, in
nonequilibrium, or in systems with strong correlations. In this work, we show
how downfolding approaches facilitate complexity reduction on the electronic
side and thereby boost the simulation of electronic properties and nuclear
motion - in particular molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Three different
downfolding strategies based on constraining, unscreening, and combinations
thereof are benchmarked against full density functional calculations for
selected charge density wave (CDW) systems, namely 1H-TaS$_2$, 1T-TiSe$_2$,
1H-NbS$_2$, and a one-dimensional carbon chain. We find that the downfolded
models can reproduce potential energy surfaces on supercells accurately and
facilitate computational speedup in MD simulations by about five orders of
magnitude in comparison to purely ab initio calculations. For monolayer
1H-TaS$_2$ we report classical replica exchange and quantum path integral MD
simulations, revealing the impact of thermal and quantum fluctuations on the
CDW transition.

We present a new lite python-based program, CrysFieldExplorer, for fast
optimizing crystal electric field (CEF) parameters to fit experimental data.
The main novelty of CrysFieldExplorer is the development of a unique loss
function, referred to as the Spectrum-Characteristic Loss
($L_{\text{Spectrum}}$), which is defined based on the characteristic
polynomial of the Hamiltonian matrix. Particle Swarm Optimization and
Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy are used to find the minimum of
the total loss function. We demonstrate that CrysFieldExplorer can performs
direct fitting of CEF parameters to any experimental data such as neutron
spectrum, susceptibility, magnetizations etc. CrysFieldExplorer can handle a
large amount of none-zero CEF parameters and reveal multiple local and global
minimum solutions. Detailed crystal field theory, description of the loss
function, implementation and limit of the program are discussed within context
of two examples.

A system of two enzymes mechanically coupled to each other in a viscous
medium was recently studied, and conditions for obtaining synchronization and
an enhanced average rate of the thermally-activated catalytic reactions of the
enzymes were identified. The transition to synchronization occurred as the
result of a global bifurcation in the underlying dynamical system. Here, we
extend and generalize this idea to an arbitrary number of noise-activated
cyclic processes, or oscillators, that are all coupled to each other via a
dissipative coupling. The $N$ coupled oscillators are described by $N$ phase
coordinates driven in a tilted washboard potential. At low $N$ and strong
coupling, we find synchronization as well as an enhancement in the average
speed of the oscillators. In the large $N$ regime, we show that the collective
dynamics can be described through a mean-field theory, which predicts a great
enhancement in the average speed. In fact, beyond a critical value of the
coupling strength, noise activation becomes irrelevant and the dynamics switch
to an effectively deterministic "running" mode. Finally, we study the
stochastic thermodynamics of the coupled oscillators, in particular their
performance with regards to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.

We study condensation of abelian bosons in string-net models, by constructing
a family of Hamiltonians that can be tuned through any such transition. We show
that these Hamiltonians admit two exactly solvable, string-net limits: one deep
in the uncondensed phase, described by an initial, uncondensed string net
Hamiltonian, and one deep in the condensed phase, described by a final,
condensed string net model. We give a systematic description of the condensed
string net model in terms of the uncondensed string net and the data associated
with the condensing abelian bosons. Specifically, if the uncondensed string net
is described by a fusion category $\mathcal{C}$, we show how the string labels
and fusion data of the fusion category $\mathcal{\tilde{C}}$ describing the
condensed string net can be obtained from that of $\mathcal{C}$ and the data
describing the string oeprators that create the condensing boson. This
construction generalizes previous approaches to anyon condensation in string
nets, by allowing the condensation of arbitrary abelian bosons, including
chiral bosons in string nets constructed from (for example) Chern-Simons
theories, which describe time-reversal invariant bilayer states. This gives a
method for obtaining the full data for string nets without explicit
time-reversal symmetry from such bilayer models. We illustrate our approach
with several examples.

Many-body Coulomb interactions drastically modify the optical response of
highly doped semiconductor quantum wells leading to a merger of all
intersubband transition resonances into one sharp peak at the frequency
substantially higher than all single-particle transition frequencies. Starting
from standard density matrix equations for the gas of pairwise interacting
fermions within Hartree-Fock approximation, we show that this effect is due to
Coulomb-induced synchronization of the oscillations of coherences of all $N$
intersubband transitions and sharp collective increase in their coupling with
an external optical field. In the high doping limit, the dynamics of
light-matter interaction is described by the analytic theory of $N$ coupled
oscillators which determines new collective normal modes of the system and
predicts the frequency and strength of the blueshifted collective resonance.

Activation of non-basal slip is essential in improving the deformability of
hexagonal crystals. However, the mechanism of non-basal slip remains largely
unknown, especially for complex intermetallics such as Laves phases. In this
work, the prismatic slip systems of C14 Laves crystals and possible metastable
states along the slip paths are assessed using atomistic simulations. Multiple
prismatic stacking fault states with the same lattice pattern but different
site occupancies and chemical distributions are identified at different
inter-atomic layers, temperatures and chemical compositions. The formation of
energetically favorable prismatic stacking faults involves short-range
diffusion which implies the thermally activated nature of prismatic slip. The
outcomes of this work advance the understanding of temperature and
chemical-dependent non-basal slip in Laves phases and can be extended to other
topologically close-packed phases.

This study investigates optical activity and quantum transport in twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, demonstrating that the former results from
spatial dispersion effects. The transfer matrix method is used to solve the
propagation of electromagnetic waves through two graphene layers that act as
the coupling surfaces of a dielectric slab. The resulting optical conductivity
tensor is decomposed into a local and a drag part, with the drag transverse
conductivity $\sigma_{xy}^{(drag)}$ governing the TBG system's optical
property. An effective continuum model is employed to analyze electron state
formation and calculate relevant parts of the optical conductivity tensor.
Correlation of electron motions leads to incomplete cancellation and a finite
$\sigma_{xy}^{(drag)}$ in the chiral TBG lattice. The study also calculates DC
conductivity, showing TBG supports quantum conductivity proportional to $e^2/h$
at the intrinsic Fermi energy.

The emergence of fractionalized quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids has
served a wealth of unconventional phenomena in frustrated magnets. In our work,
we explore the various domain patterns of such fractionalized quasiparticles,
especially focusing on charge defects in U(1) quantum spin liquids. We claim
that emergent long range interaction between charge defects leads to
characteristic structures with distinct length scales, where they can be
controlled via the ratio of interaction strengths. In this context, the spin
ice phase is the dilute gas of weakly interacting charges, whereas, the
macroscopic population of charge defects naturally develops charge ordering for
large Coulomb interaction limit. Interestingly, we find that the competing spin
interactions could naturally give rise to stabilize the mosaic structure of
charge defects in the absence of uniform ordering. They are characterized by
liquid-like correlations having a finite length scale. The emergence of such
intermediate order in the mosaic structure is confirmed by both dynamical and
static correlations. By establishing the microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we also
present the distinctive signatures in static spin correlation to detect such
spatial structure of charge defects. We speculate that the domain pattern of
defect population might be a potential hallmark to reveal unusual dynamical
properties observed in spin liquids.
