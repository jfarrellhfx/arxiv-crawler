<h3>Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation and multiwave states of a graphene  electron in external fields and free (2+1)-space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11879</a>

The relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is used for an advanced
description of planar graphene electrons in external fields and free
(2+1)-space. It is shown that the initial Dirac equation should contain usual
Dirac matrices but not the Pauli ones. The spin of graphene electrons is not
the isotopic spin and takes the values $\pm1/2$. The exact Foldy-Wouthuysen
Hamiltonian of a graphene electron in uniform and nonuniform magnetic fields is
derived. The exact energy spectrum agreeing with experimental data and exact
Foldy-Wouthuysen wave eigenfunctions are obtained. These eigenfunctions
describe multiwave (structured) states in (2+1)-space. It is proven that the
Hermite-Gauss beams exist even in the free space. In the multiwave
Hermite-Gauss states, graphene electrons acquire nonzero effective masses
dependent on a quantum number and move with group velocities which are less
than the Fermi velocity. Graphene electrons in a static electric field also can
exist in the multiwave Hermite-Gauss states defining non-spreading coherent
beams. These beams can be accelerated and decelerated.

The speed-dependent spectral line profiles collapse into a simple Lorentz
profile in the regime dominated by the velocity-changing collisions. We derive
general formulas for the effective width and shift of the Lorentzian for
arbitrary speed-dependent collisional broadening and shift and
velocity-changing collision operators. For a quadratic speed dependence of
collisional broadening and shift, and the billiard ball model of
velocity-changing collisions, we provide simple analytical expressions for the
effective Lorentzian width and shift. We show that the effective Lorentzian
width and shift split into components originating from the: well-known
Dicke-narrowed Doppler width, speed-averaged collisional broadening and shift,
their speed dependencies, and a product term that mixes the contributions of
the broadening and shift speed dependencies. We show how the components depend
on rates of speed-changing and velocity-changing collisions related to the
perturber/absorber mass ratio. We validate analytical formulas numerically on
example of H$_{2}$ transition perturbed by He.

<h3>Mechanical, Optical and Thermoelectric Properties of Janus BiTeCl  Monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11922</a>
<br>
<i>Poonam Chauhan, Jaspreet Singh, Ashok Kumar</i>
<br>
<br>
We report mechanical, optical and thermoelectric properties of recently
fabricated Janus BiTeCl monolayer using density functional and semi-classical
Boltzmann transport theory. Janus BiTeCl monolayer exhibits a direct bandgap,
high carrier mobility (~10$^3$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and high optical
absorption in the UV-visible region. The mechanical behavior of the Janus
BiTeCl monolayer is nearly isotropic having an ideal tensile strength ~ 15 GPa.
The higher value of the Gruneisen parameter ($\gamma$), a low value of phonon
group velocity (vg), and very little phonon scattering time ($\tau_p$) lead to
low lattice thermal conductivity (1.46 W/mK) of Janus BiTeCl monolayer. The
combined effect of thermal conductivity and electronic transport coefficients
of Janus BiTeCl monolayer results in the figure of merit (ZT) in the range of
0.43-0.75 at 300-500 K. Our results suggest Janus BiTeCl monolayer be a
potential candidate for optoelectronic and moderate temperature thermoelectric
applications.

<h3>Janus $β$-PdXY (X/Y = S, Se, Te) Materials with high Anisotropic  Thermoelectric Performance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11923" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11923</a>
<br>
<i>Mukesh Jakhar, Raman Sharma, Ashok Kumar</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered considerable attention as an
emerging thermoelectric (TE) material owing to their unique density of state
(DOS) near the Fermi level. We investigate the TE performance of Janus
$\beta$-PdXY (X/Y=S, Se, Te) monolayer materials as a function of carrier
concentration and mid-temperature range (300 to 800 K) by combining density
functional theory (DFT) and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. The
phonon dispersion spectra and AIMD simulations confirm their thermal and
dynamical stability. The transport calculation results reveal the highly
anisotropic TE performance for both n and p-type Janus $\beta$-PdXY monolayers.
Meanwhile, the coexistence of low phonon group velocity and converged
scattering rate leads to lower lattice thermal conductivity (K_l) of 0.80 W/m
K, 0.94 W/m K, and 0.77 W/m K along y-direction for these Janus materials.
While the high TE power factor is attributed to the high Seebeck coefficient
(S) and electrical conductivity, which is due to the degenerate top valance
bands of these Janus monolayers. The combination of lower K_l and high-power
factor at 300K (800 K) leads to an optimal figure of merit (ZT) as 0.68 (2.21),
0.86 (4.09) and 0.68 (3.63) for p-type Janus PdSSe, PdSeTe and PdSTe
monolayers. To capture rational electron transport properties, the effects of
acoustic phonon scattering ($\tau$_ac), impurity scattering ($\tau$_imp), and
polarized phonon scattering ($\tau$_polar) are included in the
temperature-dependent electron relaxation time. These findings indicated that
the Janus $\beta$-PdXY monolayers are promising candidates for TE conversion
devices.

<h3>Two-Dimensional $β$-PdX$_2$ (X = S, Te) Monolayers for Efficient  Solar Energy Conversion Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11924</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The search for highly effective and environmentally safe photocatalysts for
water splitting and photovoltaic solar cells is essential for renewable solar
energy conversion and storage. Based on first principles calculations, we show
that novel 2D $\beta$-PdX$_2$ (X = S, Te) monolayer possesses excellent
stabilities and great potentials in solar energy conversion applications.
Comprehensive studies show that the $\beta$-PdX$_2$ monolayer exhibits
semiconductor characteristics with an indirect gap, suitable band alignment,
efficient carrier separation, and high solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiencies,
supporting its good photoelectronic performance. The surface catalytic and
adsorption/intercalation energies calculation reveals that the photogenerated
holes have adequate driving forces to render hydrogen reduction half-reactions
to proceed spontaneously and the ability to cover and incorporate water
molecules on $\beta$-PdX$_2$ monolayer. Besides, the $\beta$-PdX$_2$ monolayer
is promising donor material for excitonic solar cells with high photovoltaic
performance. More importantly, due to suitable donor band gap and small
conduction band offset in the proposed type-II heterostructure, the calculated
power conversion efficiencies (PCE) is calculated up to ~23%
($\beta$-PdX$_2$/WTe$_2$), ~21% ($\beta$-PdX$_2$/ MoTe$_2$) and ~18%
($\beta$-PdTe2/$\beta$-PdX$_2$), making it a promising candidate for solar
energy conversion applications.

<h3>Top-Ranked Cycle Flux Network Analysis of Molecular Photocells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11929</a>
<br>
<i>Nikhil Gupt, Shuvadip Ghosh, Arnab Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a top-ranked cycle flux ranking scheme of network analysis to
assess the performance of molecular junction solar cells. By mapping the
Lindblad master equation to the quantum-transition network, we propose a
microscopic Hamiltonian description underpinning the rate equations commonly
used to characterize molecular photocells. Our approach elucidates the
paramount significance of edge flux and unveils two pertinent electron transfer
pathways that play equally important roles in robust photocurrent generation.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-radiative loss processes impede the
maximum power efficiency of photocells, which may otherwise be above the
Curzon-Ahlborn limit. These findings shed light on the intricate
functionalities that govern molecular photovoltaics and offer a comprehensive
approach to address them in a systematic way.

<h3>Fate of multipolar physics in $5d^2$ double perovskites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11939" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11939</a>
<br>
<i>Ahmed Rayyan, Xiaoyu Liu, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<br>
<br>
In a cubic environment, the ground state of spin-orbit coupled $5d^2$ ions is
a non-Kramers $E_g$ doublet, which hosts quadrupole and octupole moments. A
series of $5d^2$ osmium double perovskites Ba$_2M$OsO$_6$ (M = Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd)
have recently been proposed to exhibit multipolar orders. We investigate the
structural properties of these materials using $\textit{ab}$-$\textit{initio}$
calculations and find that the cubic structure is unstable for the Cd compound
while the Mg, Ca, and Zn materials retain $Fm\bar{3}m$ symmetry. We show that
Ba$_2$CdOsO$_6$ favours a rhombohedral $R\bar{3}$ structure characterized by
$a^-a^-a^-$ octahedral tiltings as indicated by unstable $\mathcal{T}_{1g}$
phonon modes. Trigonal distortions split the excited $T_{2g}$ triplet into an
$E'_g$ doublet and an $A_g$ singlet, which may cross energy levels with the
$E_g$ doublet and suppress the multipolar physics. We find a window where $E_g$
remains the lowest energy state under trigonal distortion, enabling the
emergence of multipole phases in non-cubic crystal environments.

<h3>Quantifying quantum chaos through microcanonical distributions of  entanglement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11940" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11940</a>
<br>
<i>Joaquin F. Rodriguez-Nieva, Cheryne Jonay, Vedika Khemani</i>
<br>
<br>
A characteristic feature of "quantum chaotic" systems is that their
eigenspectra and eigenstates display universal statistical properties described
by random matrix theory (RMT). However, eigenstates of local systems also
encode structure beyond RMT. To capture this, we introduce a quantitative
metric for quantum chaos which utilizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to
compare the microcanonical distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) of
midspectrum eigenstates with a reference RMT distribution generated by pure
random states (with appropriate constraints). The metric compares not just the
averages of the distributions, but also higher moments. The differences in
moments are compared on a highly-resolved scale set by the standard deviation
of the RMT distribution, which is exponentially small in system size. This
distinguishes between chaotic and integrable behavior, and also quantifies the
degree of chaos in systems assumed to be chaotic. We study this metric in local
minimally structured Floquet random circuits, as well as a canonical family of
many-body Hamiltonians, the mixed field Ising model (MFIM). For Hamiltonian
systems, the reference random distribution must be constrained to incorporate
the effect of energy conservation. The metric captures deviations from RMT
across all models and parameters, including those that have been previously
identified as strongly chaotic, and for which other diagnostics of chaos such
as level spacing statistics look strongly thermal. In Floquet circuits, the
dominant source of deviations is the second moment of the distribution, and
this persists for all system sizes. For the MFIM, we find significant variation
of the KL divergence in parameter space. Notably, we find a small region where
deviations from RMT are minimized, suggesting that "maximally chaotic"
Hamiltonians may exist in fine-tuned pockets of parameter space.

<h3>Emergence of first-order and second-order phase transitions in a cyclic  ecosystem exposed to environmental impact</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11954</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
A cyclically dominating 3-species ecosystem, modeled within the framework of
rock-paper-scissor game, is studied in presence of natural death and an effect
of the environment. The environmental impact is parameterized along with the
death rates in the rate equation of the species densities. Monte-Carlo
simulations on this system reveal that the population density bears the
signature of first-order and second-order phase transitions in different
regimes of the parameters representing natural deaths of the species. The
connection of this phenomena with the phase transitions is also supported by
the behavior of the basin entropy calculated for the system. The density of
total population evidently becomes an order parameter with respect to the
change in environmental impact on the system.

<h3>Floquet-Driven Indirect Exchange Interaction Mediated by Topological  Insulator Surface States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11963" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11963</a>
<br>
<i>Modi Ke, Mahmoud M. Asmar, Wang-Kong Tse</i>
<br>
<br>
Light drives offer a potential tool for the dynamical control of magnetic
interactions in matter. We theoretically investigate the indirect exchange
coupling between two parallel chains of magnetic impurities on the surface of a
topological insulator, driven by a time-periodic circularly polarized light
field in the high-frequency, off-resonant, regime. We derive a closed-form
analytic expression for the spin susceptibility of the photon-dressed
topological insulator surface states and obtain the irradiation dependence of
the Ising, Heisenberg, and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya exchange couplings between the
impurity chains. Our results show a two-pronged modification of these exchange
couplings by periodic drives. First, the RKKY oscillation period of the
exchange couplings can be extended by enhancing the driving strength. Secondly,
increasing driving strength enhances the envelope of RKKY oscillations of the
Heisenberg-type while suppressing those of the Ising-type and
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya-type. Our work provides useful insights for realizing
Floquet engineering of collinear and non-collinear indirect exchange
interactions in topological insulating systems.

<h3>Nanopore creation in graphene at the nanoscale for water desalination</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11970</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Creating nanopores in graphene is a powerful tool for engineering its
properties. Nanopores in graphene tune their electrical, optical, magnetic, and
mechanical properties. However, controlling nanopores formation at the
nanoscale level remains a significant challenge. We report an easy method to
control nanopore sizes using argon-plasma magnetron sputtering. By calculating
and measuring Raman spectra, we show that the nano-pores in graphene are
controllable and size-tunable. Furthermore, we report that the graphene Raman
mode around 1450 cm-1, which was attributed to the substrate effect, is due to
nanopores.
We also propose here a novel graphene device-based water filtration. Our
proposed concept of two graphene electrodes with nanopores on the substrate
(SiC and SiO2) makes it possible to have the highest permeability value,
keeping almost 100 % salt rejection and improving its mechanical properties.
These reported results are essential for developing water desalination
membranes based on graphene devices.

<h3>Topological Kinetic Crossover in a Nanomagnet Array</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11973</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Ergodic kinetics, which are critical to equilibrium thermodynamics, can be
constrained by a system's topology. We study a model nanomagnetic array in
which such constraints visibly affect the behavior. In this system, magnetic
excitations connect into thermally active one-dimensional strings whose motion
can be imaged in real time. At high temperatures, we observe the merging,
breaking, and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning
between topologically distinct configurations. Below a crossover temperature,
the string motion is dominated by simple changes in length and shape. In this
low temperature regime, the system is energetically stable because of its
inability to explore all possible topological configurations. This kinetic
crossover suggests a generalizable conception of topologically broken
ergodicity and limited equilibration.

<h3>Cooperative rheological state-switching of enzymatically-driven  composites of circular DNA and dextran</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11987" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11987</a>
<br>
<i>Juexin Marfai, Ryan J. McGorty, Rae M. Robertson-Anderson</i>
<br>
<br>
Polymer topology, which plays a principal role in the rheology of polymeric
fluids, and non-equilibrium materials, which exhibit time-varying rheological
properties, are topics of intense investigation. Here, we push composites of
circular DNA and dextran out-of-equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA
rings to linear fragments. Our time-resolved rheology measurements reveal
discrete state-switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between
dissipative and elastic-like states. The gating time and lifetime of the
elastic-like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are
surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non-monotonically depend on
the DNA fraction. We model our results using sigmoidal two-state functions to
show that bulk state-switching can arise from continuous molecular-level
activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to
support macroscopic stresses. Our platform, coupling the tunability of
topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged
for diverse material applications from wound-healing to self-repairing
infrastructure.

<h3>Unveiling the CO2 Adsorption Capabilities of Biphenylene Network  Monolayers through DFT Calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12004</a>
<br>
<i>K. A. Lopes Lima, L. A. Ribeiro Junior</i>
<br>
<br>
Nanomaterial synthesis and characterization advancements have led to the
discovery of new carbon allotropes, such as the biphenylene network (BPN). BPN
consists of four-, six-, and eight-membered rings of sp2-hybridized carbon
atoms. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
investigate the CO2 adsorption capabilities in pristine and vacancy-endowed BPN
monolayers. Our findings indicate that BPN lattices with a single-atom vacancy
exhibit higher CO2 adsorption energies than pristine BPN. Unlike other 2D
carbon allotropes, BPN does not exhibit precise CO2 sensing and selectivity by
altering its band structure configuration. In pristine lattices, CO2 molecules
are physisorbed in the eight-membered rings, while defective regions of
vacancy-endowed lattices enable chemisorption of CO2. Regarding CO2
physisorption, the recovery time values are minimal, suggesting a rapid
interaction between BPN and this molecule, with negligible relaxation time
required to alter the electronic properties of BPN lattices.

Surface properties are critical to the capabilities of superconducting
microwave devices. The native oxide of niobium-based devices is thought to
consist of a thin normal conducting layer. To improve understanding on the
importance of this layer, it was replaced with a more easily controlled gold
film. A niobium sample host microwave cavity was used to measure the surface
resistance in continuous wave operation at 4.0 GHz and 5.2 GHz. Sample
conditions studied include temperatures ranging from 1.6 K to 4.2 K with RF
magnetic fields on the sample surface ranging from 1 mT to the maximum field
before the superconducting properties were lost (quench field). The nominal
film thickness of the gold layer was increased from 0.1 nm to 2.0 nm in five
steps to study the impact of the normal layer thickness on surface resistance
on a single niobium substrate. The 0.1 nm film was found to reduce the surface
resistance of the sample and to enhance the quench field. With the exception of
the final step from a 1.5 nm gold film to 2.0 nm, the magnitude of the surface
resistance increased substantially with gold film thickness. The nature of the
surface resistance field-dependence appeared to be roughly independent from the
gold layer thickness. This initial study provides new perspectives and avenues
for optimizing and designing surfaces for resonant cavities in particle
accelerators and quantum information applications.

<h3>Maximum speed of dissipation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12047" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12047</a>
<br>
<i>Swetamber Das, Jason R. Green</i>
<br>
<br>
Physical systems powering motion or creating structure in a fixed amount of
time dissipate energy and produce entropy. Here, we derive speed limits on
dissipation from the classical, chaotic dynamics of many-particle systems: the
inverse of the entropy irreversibly produced bounds the time to execute a
physical process for deterministic systems out of equilibrium, $\Delta t\geq
k_B/\bar s_i$. We relate this statistical-mechanical speed limit on the mean
entropy rate to deterministic fluctuation theorems. For paradigmatic classical
systems, such as those exchanging energy with a deterministic thermostat, there
is a trade-off between the time to evolve to a distinguishable state and the
heat flux, $\bar{q}\Delta t\geq k_BT$. In all these forms, the inequality
constrains the relationship between dissipation and time during any
nonstationary process including transient excursions from steady states.

This article discusses the pressure-induced structural phase transition and

properties of GaSe under hydrostatic pressure. The work also includes an
analysis of the phase transformation mechanism using the solid-state Nudged
Elastic Band (SS-NEB) method. This research sheds light on the physics of

Multi principal element alloys (MPEAs) comprise a unique class of metal
alloys. MPEAs have been demonstrated to possess several exceptional properties,
including, as most relevant to the present study, a high corrosion resistance.
In the context of MPEA design, the vast number of potential alloying elements
and the staggering number of elemental combinations favours a computational
alloy design approach. In order to computationally assess the prospective
corrosion performance of MPEA, an approach was developed in this study. A
density functional theory (DFT) based Monte Carlo method was used for the
development of MPEA structure, with the AlCrTiV alloy used as a model.
High-throughput DFT calculations were performed to create training datasets for
surface activity towards different adsorbate species: O2-, Cl- and H+. Machine
learning (ML) with combined representation was then utilised to predict the
adsorption and vacancy energies as descriptors for surface activity. The
capability of the combined computational methods of MC, DFT and ML, as a
virtual electrochemical performance simulator for MPEAs was established and may
be useful in exploring other MPEAs.

Magnesium alloys are attractive options for temporary bio-implants because of
their biocompatibility, controlled corrosion rate, and similarity to natural
bone in terms of stiffness and density. Nevertheless, their low mechanical
strength hinders their use as cardiovascular stents and bone substitutes. While
it is possible to engineer alloys with the desired mechanical strength,
optimizing the mechanical properties of biocompatible magnesium alloys using
conventional experimental methods is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore,
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to streamline the alloy design
process and reduce the required time. In this study, a machine learning model
was developed to predict the yield strength (YS) of biocompatible magnesium
alloys with an $R^2$ accuracy of 91\%. The predictive model was then validated
using the CALPHAD technique and thermodynamics calculations. Next, the
predictive model was employed as the fitness function of a genetic algorithm to
optimize the alloy composition for high-strength biocompatible magnesium
implants. As a result, two alloys were proposed and synthesized, exhibiting YS
values of 108 and 113 MPa, respectively. These values were substantially higher
than those of conventional magnesium biocompatible alloys and closer to the YS
and compressive strength of natural bone. Finally, the synthesized alloys were
subjected to microstructure analysis and mechanical property testing to
validate and evaluate the performance of the proposed AI-based alloy design
approach for creating alloys with specific properties suitable for diverse
applications.

Supersolid is an exotic state of matter characterized by both superfluid
properties and periodic particle density modulation, due to spontaneous
breaking of U(1) gauge symmetry and spatial translation symmetry, respectively.
For conventional supersolids,continuous translation symmetry breaking is
accompanied by one gapless Goldstone mode in the excitation spectra. An
interesting question naturally arises: what is the consequence of breaking
discrete translation symmetry for supersolids? In this work, we propose the
concept of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ supersolid resulting from spontaneous breaking of a
discrete $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry, or equivalently, a discrete translation
symmetry. This $\mathbb{Z}_n$ supersolid is realized in the stripe phase of
spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate under an external periodic
potential with period $1/n$ of intrinsic stripe period. For $n\geq2$, there are
$n$ degenerate ground states with spontaneously broken lattice translation
symmetry. The low-energy excitations of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ supersolid include a
pseudo-Goldstone mode, whose excitation gap at long wavelength limit is found
to decrease fast with $n$. We further numerically show that, when confined in a
harmonic trap, a spin-dependent perturbation can result in the transition
between degenerate ground states of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ supersolid. With the integer
$n$ tunable using the experimental technique of generating subwavelength
optical lattice, the $\mathbb{Z}_n$ supersolid proposed here offers a cold atom
platform to simulate physics related with generic $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry
breaking, which is interesting not only in the field of cold atoms, but also in
particle physics and cosmology.

The article reports a numerical investigation of the breakdown of a
disordered system considering the effect of local stress concentration under
the action of an external tensile force. The statistics of the record-breaking
magnitudes of emitted energies during the failure process, as well as the
waiting time to achieve those record events, show rich behavior. The latter
includes information about the acceleration and subsequent catastrophic failure
through its non-monotonic behavior. The maximum waiting time is also correlated
with the maximum change in elastic energy as the model evolves, a different way
of predicting an upcoming failure, which is consistent with our hypothesis as
well. At a moderate disorder, such a prediction can be done with higher
accuracy while at a low disorder, due to the abrupt nature of the failure
process our hypothesis does not hold well.

The metal-insulator transition (MIT) observed in vanadium dioxide (VO2) has
been a topic of great research interest for past decades, with the underlying
physics yet not fully understood due to the complex electron interactions and
structures involved. The ability to understand and tune the MIT behaviour is of
vital importance from the perspective of both underlying fundamental science as
well as potential applications. In this work, we use scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) to investigate cross-section lamella of the VO2
films deposited using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on three substrates: c-cut
sapphire, TiO2(101) and TiO2(001). Advanced STEM imaging is performed in which
also the oxygen atom columns are resolved. We link the overall film quality and
structures on atomic and nanoscale to the electrical transition
characteristics. We observe poor MIT characteristics on c-sapphire due to the
presence of very small domains with six orientation variants, and on TiO2 (001)
due to the presence of cracks induced by stress relaxation. However, the MIT on
TiO2 (101) behaves favourably, despite similar stress relaxation which,
however, only lead to domain boundaries but no cracks.

Single layer $\alpha$-ruthenium trichloride ($\rm\alpha-RuCl_3$) has been
proposed as a potential quantum spin liquid. Graphene/$\rm RuCl_3$
heterobilayers have been extensively studied with a focus on their large
interlayer electron transfer driven by a chemical potential difference, which
dopes both materials. Here we examine the possibility of probing the magnetic
state of the \ce{RuCl_3} layer by measuring transport in an adjacent graphene
layer. We perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations on a
Hubbard-Kanamori model of the $4d^5$ $t_{2g}$ electrons of $\rm \alpha-RuCl_3$
and confirm that out-of-plane ferromagnetic and zigzag antiferromagnetic states
are energetically competitive. We show that the influence of hybridization
between graphene and $\rm RuCl_3$ bands is strongly sensitive to the magnetic
configuration of $\rm RuCl_3$ and the relative orientations of the two layers,
and argue that it can alter the conductivity of the graphene layer. Our
analysis can be applied to any van der Waals heterobilayer system with weak
interlayer hybridization and allows for arbitrary lattice constant mismatch and
relative orientation.

Living mycelium, a network of filamentous fungal threads, thrives on
lignocellulosic waste and exhibits rapid growth, hydrophobicity, and intrinsic
regeneration, offering a potential means to create next-generation sustainable
and functional composites. However, existing hybrid-living mycelium composites
are tremendously constrained by conventional mold-based manufacturing
processes, which are only compatible with simple geometries and loose biomass
substrates that enable gas exchange. Here we introduce a class of structural
myco-composites manufactured with a novel platform that both enables creation
of complex three-dimensional forms and yields the strongest mycelium composite
reported to date, greatly enhancing the versatility and applicability of
mycelium materials. By exploring principles of directed composite design and
broad biocompatibility, we elegantly leverage high-resolution biocomposite
additive manufacturing and robust mycelium colonization with indirect
inoculation. We illustrate the versatility of this platform by fabricating
foldable self-sealing containers and flexible mycelium textiles, and anticipate
its applicability as a blueprint for diverse hybrid-living engineered
materials.

<h3>Superdiffusion-like behavior in zero-temperature coarsening of the $d=3$  Ising model</h3>

<br>
<i>Denis Gessert, Henrik Christiansen, Wolfhard Janke</i>
<br>
<br>
One key aspect of coarsening following a quench below the critical
temperature is domain growth. For the non-conserved Ising model a power-law
growth of domains of like spins with exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ is predicted.
Including recent work, it was not possible to clearly observe this growth law
in the special case of a zero-temperature quench in the three-dimensional
model. Instead a slower growth with $\alpha<1/2$ was reported. We attempt to
clarify this discrepancy by running large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of
lattice sizes up to $L=2048$ employing an efficient GPU implementation. Indeed,
at late times we measure domain sizes compatible with the expected growth law
-- but surprisingly, at still later times domains even grow superdiffusively,
i.e., with $\alpha > 1/2$. We argue that this new problem is possibly caused by
sponge-like structures emerging at early times.

We study the dynamics of quantum statistical ensembles at first-order phase
transition points of finite macroscopic systems. First, we show that at the
first-order phase transition point of systems with an order parameter that does
not commute with the Hamiltonian, any quantum state with a non-zero value of
the order parameter always evolves towards a macroscopically distinct state
after a sufficiently long time. From this result, we argue that stationarity
required for statistical ensembles should be interpreted as stationarity on a
sufficiently long but finite time scale. Finally, we prove that the density
matrix of the squeezed ensemble, a class of generalized statistical ensembles
proposed as the only concrete method of constructing phase coexistence states
applicable to general quantum systems, is locally stationary on time scales
diverging in the thermodynamic limit. Our results support the validity of the
squeezed ensemble from a dynamical point of view and open the door to
non-equilibrium statistical physics at the first-order phase transition point.

<br>
<br>
The intricate interplay between itinerant-localized 5f states and strongly
correlated electronic states have been systematically investigated in
isostructural actinide compounds AnSn3 (An=U, Np, Pu) by using a combination of
the density functional theory and the embedded dynamical mean-field approach.
The obvious narrow flat 5f electronic band with remarkable spectral weight
emerges in the vicinity of Fermi level for three compounds. Subsequently the
significant hybridization between 5f states and conduction bands opens evident
gaps together with conspicuous valence state fluctuations jointly indicating
the partially itinerant 5f electrons. Especially, prominent quasiparticle
multiplets only appear in PuSn3 due to the sizable valence state fluctuations
and multiple competing atomic eigenstates. Therefore itinerant 5f states tend
to involve in active chemical bonding, restraining the formation of local
magnetic moment of actinide atoms, which partly elucidates the underlying
mechanism of paramagnetic USn3 and PuSn3, as well as itinerant-electron
antiferromagnetic NpSn3. Correspondingly, the 5f electronic correlation
strength expressed in band renormalization and electron effective masse
intertwines with itinerant-localized 5f states. Consequently, detail electronic
structure of 5f states dependence on actinide series shall gain deep insight
into our understanding of AnSn3 (An=U, Np, Pu) intermetallics and promote
ongoing research.

<br>
<br>
Rare-earth (RE) based honeycomb-lattice materials with strong spin-orbit
coupled Jeff=1/2 moments have attracted great interest as a platform to realize
Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) state. Herein, we report the discovery of a
new family of RE based honeycomb-lattice magnets Ba9RE2(SiO4)6(RE=Ho-Yb), which
crystallize into the rhombohedral structure with space group R-3. In these
serial compounds, magnetic RE3+ ions are arranged on a perfect honeycomb
lattice within the ab-plane and stacked in the ABCABC-type fashion along the
c-axis. All Ba9RE2(SiO4)6(RE=Ho-Yb) polycrystals exhibit the dominant
antiferromagnetic interactions and absence of magnetic order down to 2 K. In
combination with the magnetization and electron spin resonance (ESR) results,
distinct anisotropic magnetic behaviors are proposed for compounds with
different RE ions. Moreover, the synthesized Ba9Yb2Si6O24 single crystals show
large magnetic frustration and no long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.15 K,
being a possible QSL candidate state. These serial compounds are attractive for
exploring the exotic magnetic phases of Kitaev materials with 4f electrons.

<h3>Magnetostriction-driven muon localisation in an antiferromagnetic oxide</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetostriction drives a rhombohedral distortion in the cubic rock salt
antiferromagnet MnO at the N\'eel temperature $T_{N}=118$ K. As an unexpected
consequence we show that this distortion acts to localize the site of an
implanted muon due to the accompanying redistribution of electron density. This
lifts the degeneracy between equivalent sites, resulting in a single observed
muon precession frequency. Above $T_{N}$, the muon instead becomes delocalized
around a network of equivalent sites. Our first-principles simulations based on
Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory and molecular dynamics are
consistent with our experimental data and help to resolve a long-standing
puzzle regarding muon data on MnO, as well as having wider applicability to
other magnetic oxides.

<h3>Exsolution of oxygen impurity from diamond lattice and formation of  pressurized CO2-I precipitates</h3>

<br>
Diamond single crystals showing Infra-red features of pressurized CO2-I phase
were studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and tomography.
Numerous O-containing precipitates with sizes up to 45 nm are observed. The
absolute majority of these precipitates decorate dislocation loops or are
located inside them; individual scattered precipitates are also present.
Morphology of the precipitates varies from quasi-isometric octahedra to highly
flattened elongated ones. Close association of the precipitates with the
dislocation loops implies their formation by exsolution of oxygen impurity from
diamond lattice; the size distribution of the precipitates suggests that the
equilibrium state is not yet reached. Presumably, the morphology and precise
chemical composition depend on P-T-t evolution of the diamond crystal and
corresponding changes in oxygen supersaturation in the lattice. The
CO2-containing diamonds often contain micron-sized hexagonal lamellar
inclusions. TEM investigation of a lamellae reveals that it consists of high
quality graphite showing partial epitaxial relation with comprising diamond.
The gap between the graphite and diamond may be enriched with oxygen impurity.

We report that the polarizations of sidebands emitted from bulk gallium
arsenide (GaAs) driven by a strong terahertz (THz) laser while probed with a
weak near-infrared laser can be viewed as interferograms from a Michelson-like
interferometer for Bloch waves. A simple analytical model is introduced to
calculate the difference in quantum mechanical phases accumulated by Bloch
waves associated with electron-heavy hole and electron-light hole pairs in
their respective interferometer arms. The measured and calculated spectra are
in good quantitative agreement, including scaling with THz field strength. Our
results indicate a simple way to extract material parameters in future
experiments

<h3>Healing of a Topological Scar: Coordination Defects in a Honeycomb  Lattice</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
A crystal structure with a point defect typically returns to its ideal local
structure upon moving a few bond lengths away from the defect; topological
defects such as dislocations or disclinations also heal rapidly in this regard.
Here we describe a simple point defect -- a two-fold atom incorporated at the
growth edge of a 2D hexagonal honeycomb material -- whose healing may require a
defect complex with 50 or more atoms. $\textit{Topologically}$ the two-fold
atom disappears into a single 'long bond' between its neighbors, thereby
inducing a pentagonal disclination. However, $\textit{chemically}$ this
disclination occupies as much physical space as a six-fold ring. This
incompatibility of chemistry and topology can cause a ''ringing'' of the
Gaussian curvature that creates an expansive healing region and may even spawn
a semi-infinite grain boundary propagating outwards from the topological scar.

<i>Shan-Zhong Li, Zhi Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Inspired by the recently discovered phenomenon of re-entrant localization
(REL) [Roy et al., PRL 126, 106803 (2021)], we propose a new approach to induce
REL, i.e., to control the quasiperiodic potential's phase-shift between odd and
even sites, as thus the system can be dubbed as a phase-shift AAH model. We
then analyze the participation ratios and corresponding scaling behaviors, and
the results reveal that multiple re-entrant localization (MREL) phenomenon
occurs. Furthermore, by depicting the behavior of extension dynamics, we obtain
a whole visualized process of the system entering and re-entering the localized
phase multiple times. Finally, we exhibit the distribution of quasiperiodic
potential with phase-shift, and show the reason for the occurrence of MREL
phenomenon, i.e., the introduction of phase-shift enables a part of eigenstates
to escape from the localized phase, thus weakening the ''localizibility'' of
the system.

<br>
<br>
In ferroelectric (FE) materials, characteristics of a domain wall (DW), such
as charge neutrality, width, polarization, speed, favorability, etc. strongly
depend on the orientation of the domains. As an emerging FE material, Hafnium
Zirconium Oxide (HZO) based lateral DWs have been widely studied both with
theory and experiments. But DW of Head-to-Head/ Tail-to-Tail (H-H/T-T) type is
yet to be reported in HZO based FEs. In this work, we analyze T-T DW in
freestanding HZO and Metal-HZO-Metal structures with vacancy-free
non-stoichiometric oxygen termination using the first principles calculation.
Our analysis indicates that stable T-T DW forms in this type of structure, but
H-H DW is energetically unfavorable. This signifies the possibility of T-T DW
formation locally near vacancy-free region of HZO thin films. It is widely
known to the FE research community that FE HZO unit cell has unique
ferroelectric-dielectric (FE-DE) segmentation and different microscopic
configurations of both upward and downward polarized domains. Considering
different combinations of the domains, we find that cross pattern of DE and FE
segments in two neighboring domains along the polarization direction (where DE
segment of one domain faces the FE segment of the other domain) ensures the
stability of the T-T DW with minimum energy. Here, atomic configuration in the
T-T DW resembles $pbcn$ phase and the DW is half unit cell thick. Our
calculation indicates that polarization bound charges are being compensated by
ionic charges near the DW and surface/interface. In this work, we also
investigate domain kinetics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of
this type of DW.

<br>
<br>
Phospholipid surface assemblies are crucial ingredients in reducing the
boundary friction of articular cartilage in synovial joints such as hips and
knees, of central importance to their homeostasis and to tissue-wear-related
diseases such as osteoarthritis. From the point of view of biolubrication, the
very large number of different lipids in joints begs the question of whether
this is natural redundancy, or does this multiplicity confer any benefits,
possibly through natural selection. Here we demonstrate that particular
combinations of lipids present in joints may carry a clear benefit for their
lubricating properties. Using progressively more complex mixtures of lipids
representative of those in joints, and measuring their interactions using a
uniquely-sensitive surface forces balance at physiologically-relevant salt
concentrations and pressures, we show that different lipid combinations lead to
very significant differences in their efficacy as boundary lubricants. This
points to a clear synergy arising from the multiple lipid types in the
lubricating layers, provides insight into the role of lipid type proliferation
in synovial joints, of possibly evolutionary origins, and may suggest new
treatment modalities for osteoarthritis. We identify parameters of lipid-based
boundary layers that might contribute to improved boundary lubrication in the
light of the present study. Finally, we describe a possible approach based on
molecular dynamics (MD) to emulating such optimal lipid combinations, and
provide proof-of-concept MD simulations to illustrate this approach.

<h3>Patterns, spin-spin correlations and competing instabilities in driven  quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>

<i>Sandra M Jose, Komal Sah, Rejish Nath</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the formation of transient patterns and spin-spin correlations in
quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates subjected to
parametric driving of $s$-wave scattering lengths. The dynamics for an initial
ferromagnetic phase is identical to that of a scalar condensate. In contrast,
intriguing dynamics emerges for an initial polar state. For instance, we show
that competition exists between density patterns and spin-mixing dynamics.
Dominant spin-mixing dynamics lead to a gas of polar core vortices and
anti-vortices of different spin textures. The density modes of the Bogoliubov
spectrum govern the wavenumber selection of Faraday patterns. The spin modes
determine the vortex density and the spatial dependence of spin-spin
correlation functions. When the density patterns outgrow the spin-mixing
dynamics, the spin-spin correlations decay exponentially with a correlation
length of the order a spin healing length; otherwise, they exhibit a Bessel
function dependence. Strikingly, competing instabilities within density and
spin modes emerge when both scattering lengths are modulated at different
frequencies and appropriate modulation amplitudes. The competing instability
leads to a superposition of density patterns or correlation functions of two
distinct wavelengths. Our studies reveal that fine control over the driven
dynamics can be attained by tuning interaction strengths, quadratic Zeeman
field, driving frequencies, and amplitudes.

Spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques allow controlling magnetic degrees of
freedom in various materials and devices. However, while the transfer of
angular momenta between electrons has been widely studied, the contribution of
nuclear spins has yet to be explored further. This article demonstrates that
the hyperfine interactions, which consists of Fermi contact and dipolar
interactions, can mediate the application of spin-orbit torques acting on
nuclear spins. Our starting point is a sizable nuclear spin in a metal with
electronic spin accumulation. Then, via the hyperfine interactions, the nuclear
spin induces an electronic spin density. The reactions to the equilibrium and
nonequilibrium components of the spin density is a torque on the nucleus with
field-like and damping-like components, respectively. This nuclear spin-orbit
torque is a step toward stabilizing and controlling nuclear magnetic momenta,
in magnitude and direction, and realizing nuclear spintronics.

Exchange bias is a unidirectional magnetic anisotropy that often arise from
interfacial interaction of a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers. In
this article, we show that a metallic layer with spin-orbit interaction can
induces an exchange bias via an interface magnetoelectric effect. In linear

interactions that arises from the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the exchange bias can be controlled by electric field.

While a parent Hamiltonian for Laughlin $1/3$ wave function has been long
known in terms of the Haldane pseudopotentials, no parent Hamiltonians are
known for the lowest-Landau-level projected wave functions of the composite
fermion theory at $n/(2n+1)$ with $n\geq2$. If one takes the two lowest Landau
levels to be degenerate, the Trugman-Kivelson interaction produces the
unprojected 2/5 wave function as the unique zero energy solution. If the lowest
three Landau levels are assumed to be degenerate, the Trugman-Kivelson
interaction produces a large number of zero energy states at $\nu=3/7$. We
propose that adding an appropriately constructed three-body interaction yields
the unprojected $3/7$ wave function as the unique zero energy solution, and
report extensive exact diagonalization studies that provide strong support to
this proposal.

<br>
<br>
Using the supersymmetric method of random matrix theory within the Heidelberg
approach framework we provide statistical description of stationary intensity
sampled in locations inside an open wave-chaotic cavity, assuming that the
time-reversal invariance inside the cavity is fully broken. In particular, we
show that when incoming waves are fed via a finite number $M$ of open channels
the probability density ${\cal P}(I)$ for the single-point intensity $I$ decays
as a powerlaw for large intensities: ${\cal P}(I)\sim I^{-(M+2)}$, provided
there is no internal losses. This behaviour is in marked difference with the
Rayleigh law ${\cal P}(I)\sim \exp(-I/\overline{I})$ which turns out to be
valid only in the limit $M\to \infty$. We also find the joint probability
density of intensities $I_1, \ldots, I_L$ in $L>1$ observation points, and then
extract the corresponding statistics for the maximal intensity in the
observation pattern. For $L\to \infty$ the resulting limiting extreme value
statistics (EVS) turns out to be very different from the classical EVS
distributions.

<br>
<br>
Experimental studies and numerical simulations have been devoted to the
motion of an object subjected to a dry friction and an external random force.
The experimental and numerical observations suggest that the variance of the
object displacement grows linearly with time. Here, the variance growth rate is
called diffusivity. The goal of this paper is to propose efficient stochastic
simulation methods for computing the diffusivity when the external random force
is white or colored and to provide a theoretical justification supporting
experimental observations. We show that the variance of the object displacement
has a linear growth in time. We obtain a representation formula for the
diffusivity as an expectation of a functional of an excursion. This makes it
possible to design a consistent estimator of the diffusivity with an associated
confidence interval. We show that the estimator has much better convergence
properties than usual Monte Carlo estimators. From highly accurate simulations
we can then propose and discuss scaling relations between the diffusivity,
noise strength and correlation time.

developed efficient algorithms. Our GW-BSE calculations reveal a giant in-gap
peak in the shift current spectrum in all the studied BN systems due to the
excitation of the A exciton. The peak value of the excitonic shift current is
more than three times larger than that of the quasiparticle shift current, and
is attributed to the gigantic enhancement of the optical dipole matrix element
by the A exciton resonance. The effective exciton shift current conductivity is
nearly ten times larger than the largest shift conductivity observed in
ferroelectric semiconductors. Importantly, the direction of the shift current
in the BN nanotubes is found to be independent of the tube chirality ($n,0$)
(or diameter), contrary to the simple rule of $
sgn(J_\text{shift})=\text{mod}(n,3)$ predicted by previous model Hamiltonian
studies. Finally, our {\it ab initio} calculations also show that the exciton
excitation energies decrease significantly with the decreasing diameter due to
the curvature-induced orbital rehybridization in small diameter zigzag BN
nanotubes.

performance. The occurrence of MBS can enhance the performance to rival, as

We report the structural and magnetic results of polar {\alpha}-GeTe doped
with Sn and Mn from x = 0.185 to 0.841 and y = 0.02 to 0.086, respectively. The
magnetic results of Ge1-x-y(SnxMny)Te (GSMT) crystals identify Mn-clustering
effect with scaling parameter, R = 0.033 for x ~ 0.2 and y = 0.06. The
excessive Sn ions are assumed to drive the inception of short range
ferromagnetic clusters. For the crystals revealing glassy magnetic behavior,
the irreversibility temperature, Tirr shifts at high dc magnetic field which is
well described by de Almeida-Thouless equation, {\delta}Tirr ~ H{\Phi}/2
yielding {\Phi} values of 1.55 and 1.7 that validates the formation of Mn
clusters. The spin relaxation time, {\tau}0 ~ 10-9 s, activation energy, Ea/kB
~ 5 TF where TF is freeing temperature and Vogel-Fulcher temperature, T0 ~ TF
also signify intracluster interactions. Also, the Mn-hole magnetic exchange
constant, Jpd drops from 0.24 eV for the samples with smaller Sn content of x ~
0.2 to 0.16 eV for Sn rich alloy with x ~ 0.8. Consequently, we present a

We argue that spin and valley-polarized metallic phases recently observed in
graphene bilayers and trilayers support chiral edge modes that allow spin waves
to propagate ballistically along system boundaries without backscattering. The
chiral edge behavior originates from the interplay between the momentum-space
Berry curvature in Dirac bands and the geometric phase of a spin texture in
position space. The edge modes are weakly confined to the edge, featuring
dispersion which is robust and insensitive to the detailed profile of
magnetization at the edge. This unique character of edge modes reduces their
overlap with edge disorder and enhances the mode lifetime. The mode propagation
direction reverses upon reversing valley polarization, an effect that provides
a clear testable signature of geometric interactions in isospin-polarized Dirac
bands.

<h3>Active dislocations and topological traps govern dynamics of spiraling  filamentous cyanobacteria</h3>

Activity can organize matter in unique configurations inaccessible to
equilibrium systems, including a sundry of spiraling shapes seen in nature that
range from galaxies to living tissues to fossilized stromatolites. How these
dynamic yet stable patterns form in motile active systems that span a range of
length and time scales remains an open question. Here we study the collective
gliding dynamics of ultra-long filamentous cyanobacteria confined in two
dimensions and present the discovery of an emergent pattern we call ``active
spirals". Individual filaments in the spiral bulk remain confluent due to
adhesion forces and exhibit reversible gliding motility. Thus individual
filaments undergo bidirectional movement and the spiral object as a whole has
no fixed vorticity. Using single filament tracking, we discover that spirals
permit the radial flux of material as filaments shear past one another. We
demonstrate that these rearrangements can be entirely described by topological
rules of interaction between filaments tips. We thus reduce the dynamics of a
spiral to a set of active dislocations (corresponding to the filament tips) on
a polar coordinate lattice and show that we can reproduce and predict the
material flux in the system. Finally, we present a discovery of a novel
topological trap present in these spirals, and is induced purely by the
geometric chirality of long winding filaments with winding number greater than
zero. A topological trap creates boundaries in the spiral across which material
cannot flow, leading to persistent structures that are topologically locked for
the lifetime of the system. The emergent mechanics of active spirals presented
here sheds light on the critical role of adhesion forces, activity and geometry
in the formation of long-term, stable, yet dynamic active patterns.

<h3>Scattering off a junction</h3>

Scattering off a potential is a fundamental problem in quantum physics. It
has been studied extensively with amplitudes derived for various potentials. In
this article, we explore a setting with no potentials, where scattering occurs
off a junction where many wires meet. We study this problem using a
tight-binding discretization of a star graph geometry -- one incoming wire and
$M$ outgoing wires intersecting at a point. When an incoming wave scatters, one
part is reflected along the same wire while the rest is transmitted along the
others. Remarkably, the reflectance increases monotonically with $M$, i.e., the
greater the number of outgoing channels, the more the particle bounces back. In
the $M \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the wave is entirely reflected back along the
incoming wire. We rationalize this observation by establishing a quantitative
mapping between a junction and an on-site potential. To each junction, we
assign an equivalent potential that produces the same reflectance. As the
number of wires ($M$) increases, the equivalent potential also increases. A
recent article by one of us has drawn an equivalence between junctions and
potentials from the point of view of bound state formation. Our results here
show that the same equivalence also holds for scattering amplitudes. We verify
our analytic results by simulating wavepacket motion through a junction. We
extend the wavepacket approach to two dimensions where analytic solutions
cannot be found. An incoming wave travels on a sheet and scatters off a point
where many sheets intersect. Unlike in 1D, the equivalent potential is
momentum-dependent. Nevertheless, for any given momentum, the equivalent
potential grows monotonically with the number of intersecting sheets. Our
findings can be tested in ultracold atom setups and semiconductor structures.

Artificial lattices have been used as a platform to extend the application of
topological physics beyond electronic systems. Here, using the two-dimensional
Lieb lattice as a prototypical example, we show that an array of disks which
each support localized plasmon modes give rise to an analog of the quantum spin
Hall state enforced by a synthetic time reversal symmetry. We find that an
effective next-nearest-neighbor coupling mechanism intrinsic to the plasmonic
disk array introduces a nontrivial $Z_2$ topological order and gaps out the
Bloch spectrum. A faithful mapping of the plasmonic system onto a tight-binding
model is developed and shown to capture its essential topological signatures.
Full wave numerical simulations of graphene disks arranged in a Lieb lattice
confirm the existence of propagating helical boundary modes in the nontrivial
band gap.

We study the eigenvalue of the Wishart matrix which is created form the time
series with the temporal correlation. When there is no correlation, the
eigenvalue distribution of the Wishart matrix is known as the Marchenko-Pastur
distribution (MPD) in the double scaling limit. When there is the temporal
correlation, the eigenvalue distribution converges to the deformed MPD which
has longer tail and higher peak than the MPD. We discuss the moments of the
distribution and the convergence to the deformed MPD. We show the second moment
increases as the temporal correlation increases. When the temporal correlation
is the power decay, we can confirm the phase transition. When $\gamma>1/2$
which is the power index, the second moment of the distribution is finite and
the largest eigenvalue is finite. On the other hand, when $\gamma\leq 1/2$, the
second moment is infinite and the maximum eigenvalue is infinite.

In this study, we have used density functional theory (DFT) based
first-principles investigation of the physical properties of prospective NbAlB
compound for the first time. From the analysis of the cohesive energy and
enthalpy of formation, it was found that NbAlB is chemically stable. The
physical properties of NbAlB have been compared and contrasted with those
obtained for MoAlB. Both these MAB phases are elastically anisotropic,
mechanically stable, machinable and brittle materials. Structural and elastic
features reflect the layered features. The estimated hardness of NbAlB is 19.0
GPa comparable to that of MoAlB (20.8 GPa) suggesting that predicted NbAlB is a
hard compound and is suitable for heavy duty industrial applications. NbAlB is
more machinable than MoAlB. Electronic band structure calculations reveal
conventional metallic behavior with the electronic density of states at the
Fermi level arising mainly due to the Nb 4d orbitals in NbAlB. The electronic
density of states at the Fermi level is significantly higher in NbAlB in
comparison to MoAlB, indicating that NbAlB is expected to exhibit higher level
of electrical conductivity. Electronic dispersion is highly anisotropic for
both MoAlB and NbAlB with substantially large electronic effective masses in
the out-of-plane directions. The bonding features have been elucidated via the
analysis of the band structure and charge density distribution. Both the
compounds have mixed covalent, ionic and metallic bonding characteristics. The
Fermi surfaces of MoAlB and NbAlB consists of electron and hole like sheets.
The Debye temperatures of MoAlB and NbAlB are comparable. The estimated melting
temperature of NbAlB is somewhat lower than that of MoAlB. NbAlB shows
excellent reflection characteristics suitable to be used as an efficient solar
reflector. NbAlB is also expected to absorb ultraviolet radiation very
effectively.

Recent inspection of liquid-like state in ultracold atomic gases due to the
stabilization mechanism through the delicate balance between effective
mean-field and beyond mean-field (BMF) interactions, has motivated us to study
the modified/extended Gross-Pitaevskii (eGP) equation which includes the BMF
contribution. In this article, we focus on variational analysis of solitonic
regime with eGP equation while the soliton is subjected to an obstacle. This
reveals different scattering scenarios of the soliton with explicit dependence
of the BMF interaction. The results show the existence of tunneling, partial
and complete trappings, in different parameter domains. These observations are
further corroborated by the fast-Fourier transform method. In the later part we
also extend our analysis to trapped systems. The controlled trapping in defect
potential and its release can be potentially useful for quantum information
storage.

Continued advances in quantum technologies rely on producing nanometer-scale
wires. Although several state-of-the-art nanolithographic technologies and
bottom-up synthesis processes have been used to engineer such wires, critical
challenges remain in growing uniform atomic-scale crystalline wires and
constructing their network structures. Here we discover a simple method to
fabricate atomic-scale wires with various arrangements, including stripes, X-,
Y-junctions, and nanorings. Single-crystalline atomic-scale wires of a Mott
insulator, whose band gap is comparable to those of wide-gap semiconductors,
are spontaneously grown on graphite substrates \DEL{and epitaxial monolayer
graphene on SiC }by pulsed-laser deposition. These wires are
one-unit-cell-thick and have an exact width of two- and four-unit-cells (1.4
and 2.8\,nm) and lengths up to a few $\mu m$. We show that the non-equilibrium
reaction-diffusion processes may play an essential role in atomic pattern
formation. Our findings offer a new perspective on the non-equilibrium
self-organization phenomena on an atomic scale, paving a unique way for the
quantum architecture of nano-network.

Single crystals of non-centrosymmetric $s$-wave superconductor
LaPt$_{0.88}$Si$_{1.12}$ have been grown by the Czochralski (Cz) technique,
whose crystal structure is described by the space group $I4{_1}md$ at ambient
conditions. The inter-site mixing between platinum and silicon is confirmed by
both single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SXRD) and electron probe micro-analyzer
(EPMA). The disordered material exhibits a lower superconducting (SC)
transition temperature $T_c$ at 2.02 K as opposed to the highest value of 3.9 K
reported in polycrystalline LaPtSi without inter-site mixing. From specific
heat, the Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma$) is estimated to be 7.85 mJ/mol
K$^2$, which is much larger than the values reported for the samples exhibiting
higher $T_c$. This is unprecedented as $T_c$ seems to decrease with increase in
the electron density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy and thus $\gamma$. The
present work reports on the anomalous behaviour of SC and normal state
properties of LaPt$_{x}$Si$_{2-x}$, presumably caused due to the existence of
non-trivial topological bands.

As a prototype of the Weyl superconductor, layered molybdenum telluride
(MoTe2) encompasses two semimetallic phases (1T_prime and Td) which
differentiate from each other via a slight tilting of the out-of-plane lattice.
Both phases are subjected to serious phase mixing which complicates the
analysis of its origin of superconductivity. Herein, we explore the
electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of the monolayer semimetallic MoTe2, without
phase ambiguity under this thickness limit. Apart from the hardening or
softening of phonon modes, the strength of the EPC can be strongly modulated by
doping. Specifically, longitudinal and out-of-plane acoustic modes are
significantly activated for electron doped MoTe2. This is ascribed to the
presence of rich valley states and equispaced nesting bands which are
dynamically populated under charge doping. Through comparing the monolayer and
bilayer MoTe2, the strength of EPC is found to be less likely to depend on
thickness for neutral samples but clearly promoted for thinner samples with
electron doping, while for hole doping, the strength alters more significantly
with the thickness than doping. Our work explains the puzzling issue of the
doping sensitivity of the superconductivity in semimetallic MoTe2 and
establishes the critical role of activating acoustic phonons in such
low-dimensional materials.

<br>
<br>
Parametric oscillation occurs when a parameter of an oscillator is
periodically modulated. Owing to time-reversal symmetry breaking in magnets,
nonreciprocal magnons can be parametrically excited when spatial-inversion
symmetry breaking is provided. This means that magnons with opposite
propagation directions have different amplitudes. Here we demonstrate switching
on and off the magnon parametric oscillation by reversing the external field
direction applied to a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ micro-structured film. The result
originates from the nonreciprocity of surface mode magnons, leading to
field-direction dependence of the magnon accumulation under a nonuniform
microwave pumping. Our numerical calculation well reproduces the experimental
result.

Four-nitrogen-containing 5,6,13,14-Tetraazapentacene (BTANC) has attracted
attention as a new n-type organic semiconductor with a rigid crystalline phase
due to intermolecular CH-N hydrogen bonding. However, in the thin film
transistor of BTANC, poor carrier transport properties and low stability in the
ambient condition have been reported so far; thus further refining and
understanding of the thin film of BTANC will be required. Here, by means of
carefully-controlled vacuum deposition of BTANC in the narrow window of
temperature avoiding impurity sublimation and thermal degradation of molecules,
we produced a well-defined monolayer on Cu(111) for molecular-level
investigations. Synchrotron photoemission of the monolayer revealed a
noticeable alteration of the chemical state of N atoms, which is unexpected for
the pure BTANC molecule. In addition, molecular imaging of the monolayer by
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) revealed that the molecular packing
structure in the monolayer significantly differed from that in the single
crystal of BTANC. These observations can be interpreted as a result of the
partial hydrogenation of N atoms in BTANC and the emergence of the NH-N type
intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the monolayer. These findings will provide a
general remark and strategy to control the molecular packing structure and
electronic property in the molecular films of the nitrogen-containing acenes,
by means of controlled hydrogenation.

The present study investigates the arrangement of hollow pyramidal cone
shells and their interactions with degenerate planar anchoring on the inner and
outer surfaces of particles within the nematic host. The shell thickness is in
order of the nematic coherence length. The numerical behavior of colloids is
determined by minimizing the Landau-de Gennes free energy in the presence of
the Fournier surface energy and using the finite element method. Colloidal
pyramidal cones can orient parallel and perpendicular with the far director
orientation. In the parallel alignment, we found the splay director distortion
into the pyramid with two boojum defects at the inner and outer tips. The
director shows bending distortion without defect patterns when the pyramid is
aligned perpendicularly. They induce long-range dipolar interaction and can
form nested structures in close contact.

Lattice relaxation in twistronic bilayers with close lattice parameters and

transformation of moir\'e pattern into a sequence of preferential stacking
domains and domain wall networks. Here, we show that reconstructed moir\'e
superlattices of the perfectly aligned heterobilayers of same-chalcogen
transition metal dichalcogenides have broken-symmetry structures featuring
twisted nodes ('twirls') of domain wall networks. Analysing
twist-angle-dependences of strain characteristics for the broken-symmetry
structures we show that the formation of twirl reduces amount of hydrostatic
strain around the nodes, potentially, reducing their infuence on the band edge

Two typical morphology of two-dimensional aggregates are considered: compact
crystalline clusters and string-like non-compact conformations. Simulated
trajectories of both types of aggregates are analysed with fine spatial
resolution. While the long-time geometry of such trajectories appears to be
statistically identical for two conformations, the self-overlap statistics
reveal two distinct short-time {\em pre-caging} mechanisms. While the
time-scale is directly proportional with length-scale for particles in a
compact aggregates, an inverse relationship holds for non-compact clusters.
These short length-fast time relationship of particle localization might hold
the key to the structure-function relationship of aggregate forming systems and
other non-equilibrium soft materials.

<h3>Quantum Current and Holographic Categorical Symmetry</h3>

We establish the formulation for quantum current. Given a symmetry group $G$,
let $\mathcal{C}:=\mathrm{Rep}\, G$ be its representation category. Physically,
symmetry charges are objects of $\mathcal{C}$ and symmetric operators are
morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. The addition of charges is given by the tensor
product of representations. For any symmetric operator $O$ crossing two
subsystems, the exact symmetry charge transported by $O$ can be extracted. The
quantum current is defined as symmetric operators that can transport symmetry
charges over an arbitrary long distance. A quantum current exactly corresponds
to an object in the Drinfeld center $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$. The condition for
quantum currents to be condensed is also specified. To express the local
conservation, the internal hom must be used to compute the charge difference,
and the framework of enriched category is inevitable. To illustrate these
ideas, we develop a rigorous scheme of renormalization in one-dimensional
lattice systems and analyse the fixed-point models. It is proved that in the
fixed-point models, condensed quantum currents form a Lagrangian algebra in
$Z_1(\mathcal{C})$ and the boundary-bulk correspondence is verified in the
enriched setting. Overall, the quantum current provides a natural physical
interpretation to the holographic categorical symmetry.

<h3>Relation between the escort average in microcanonical ensemble and the  escort average in canonical ensemble in the Tsallis statistics</h3>

We studied the escort averages in microcanonical and canonical ensembles in
the Tsallis statistics of entropic parameter $q>1$. The quantity $(q-1)$ is the
measure of the deviation from the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. We derived the
relation between the escort average in the microcanonical ensemble and the
escort average in the canonical ensemble. Conditions arise by requiring that
the integrals appeared in the canonical ensemble do not diverge. A condition is
the relation between the heat capacity $C_V^{\mathrm{CE}}$ at constant volume
in the canonical ensemble and the entropic parameter $q$: $0 < (q-1)
C_V^{\mathrm{CE}} < 1$. This condition gives the known condition when
$C_V^{\mathrm{CE}}$ equals the number of ingredients $N$. With the derived
relation, we calculated the energy, the energy fluctuation, and the difference
between the canonical ensemble and the microcanonical ensemble in the
expectation value of the square of Hamiltonian. The difference between the
microcanonical ensemble and the canonical ensemble in energy is small because
of the condition. The heat capacity $C_V^{\mathrm{CE}}$ and the quantity
$(q-1)$ are related to the energy fluctuation and the difference. It was shown
that the magnitude of the relative difference
$|(S^{\mathrm{CE}}_{\mathrm{R}q}-S^{\mathrm{ME}}_{\mathrm{R}q})/S^{\mathrm{ME}}_{\mathrm{R}q}|$
is small when the number of free particles is large, where
$S^{\mathrm{ME}}_{\mathrm{R}q}$ is the R\'enyi entropy in the microcanonical
ensemble and $S^{\mathrm{CE}}_{\mathrm{R}q}$ is the R\'enyi entropy in the
canonical ensemble. The similar result was also obtained for the Tsallis
entropy.

The intermetallic Mn-phase, which precipitates in steels and superalloys, can
noticeably soften the mechanical properties of their matrix. Despite the
importance of developing superalloys and steels, the thermodynamic properties
and directions of thermal expansion of the Mu-phase are still poorly studied.
In this work, the thermal expansion paths, elastic, thermal and thermodynamic
properties of the Fe23Mo16 and Fe7Mo6 Mu-phases have been studied using
first-principles based quasi-harmonic Debye-Gruneisen approach. A method
allowing avoids differentiation in many variables is used. The free energies
consisting of the electronic, vibrational and magnetic energy contributions,
calculated along different paths of thermal expansions were compared between
themselves. A path with the least free energy was chosen as the trajectory of
thermal expansion. Negative thermal expansion of the Fe7Mo6 compound was
predicted, while the Fe23Mo16 has a conventional thermal expansion and negative
TEC in the parameter c. The thermal expansions of both these compounds are not
isotropic. The elastic constants, modulus, heat capacities, Curie and Debye
temperatures were predicted. The obtained results satisfactorily agree with the
available experimental data. Physical factors affecting the stability of
Fe23Mo16 and Fe7Mo6 have been studied. The paper presents an essential feature
of thermal expansions of the Mu-phase of the Fe-Mo system, which can provide an
insight into future developments.

Self-organization in natural and engineered systems causes the emergence of
ordered spatio-temporal motifs. In presence of diffusive species, Turing theory
has been widely used to understand the formation of such patterns obtained from
a diffusion-driven instability mechanism. The theory was later extended to
networked systems, where the reaction processes occur locally (in the nodes),
while diffusion takes place through the networks links. The condition for the
instability onset relies on the spectral property of the Laplace matrix, i.e.,
the diffusive operator, and in particular on the existence of an eigenbasis. In
this work we make one step forward and we prove the validity of Turing idea
also in the case of a defective Laplace matrix. Moreover, by using both
eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors we show that we can reconstruct the
asymptotic pattern with a relatively small discrepancy. Because a large
majority of empirical networks are non-normal and often defective, our results
pave the way for a thorough understanding of self-organization in real-world
systems.

<h3>Quantifying `local softness' in a simple liquid</h3>

Mutual information between local stress and local non-affine deformation is
proposed as a collective field variable quantifying the {\em local softness} of
soft materials. The liquid-solid transition in a simple liquid is considered as
a generic example of mechanical transformation through varying correlation
between stress and deformation at the microscopic level. Probing through this
new measure, a liquid appears as a spatially heterogeneous medium of
interacting interconnected regions of varying softness. In contrast, the soft
regions shrink to isolated spots in the background of a negligible mean
softness in the case of solids. In this view, the thermodynamic transition
becomes purely geometric while keeping the essential mechanical information
intact. Besides offering a general framework for understanding the mechanics of
materials, this new approach can complement recent machine learning efforts by
assigning physical meaning to their findings. Further, this collective variable
can be used on the fly during material characterization as both of its
ingredient variables are experimentally accessible.

<h3>Machine Learning the Relationship between Debye and Superconducting  Transition Temperatures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently a relationship between the Debye temperature $\Theta_D$ and the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of conventional superconductors
has been proposed [npj Quantum Materials $\mathbf{3}$, 59 (2018)]. The
relationship indicates that $T_c \le A \Theta_D$ for phonon-mediated BCS
superconductors, with $A$ being a material-specific pre-factor of order $\sim
0.1$. In order to verify this bound, we train machine learning (ML) models with
10,330 samples in the Materials Project database to predict $\Theta_D$. By
applying our ML models to 9,860 known superconductors in the NIMS SuperCon
database, we find that the conventional superconductors in the database indeed
follow the proposed bound. We also perform first-principles phonon calculations
for H$_{3}$S and LaH$_{10}$ at 200 GPa. The calculation results indicate that
these high-pressure hydrides essentially saturate the bound of $T_c$ versus
$\Theta_D$.

<h3>Out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior arising during round-trip protocols  across a quantum first-order transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12993" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12993</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Tarantelli, Stefano Scopa</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin chains during a
round-trip protocol that slowly drives the system across a quantum first-order
transition. Out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors \`a la Kibble-Zurek for the
single-passage protocol across the first-order transition have been previously
determined. Here, we show that such scaling relations persist when the driving
protocol is inverted and the transition is approached again by a
far-from-equilibrium state. This results in a quasi-universality of the scaling
functions, which keep some dependence on the details of the protocol at the
inversion time. We explicitly determine such quasi-universal scaling functions
by employing an effective two-level description of the many-body system near
the transition. We discuss the validity of this approximation and how this
relates to the observed scaling regime. Although our results apply to generic
systems, we focus on the prototypical example of a $1D$ transverse field Ising
model in the ferromagnetic regime, which we drive across the first-order
transitions through a time-dependent longitudinal field.

<h3>Skyrmions and antiskyrmions in monoaxial chiral magnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that competition between local interactions in monoaxial chiral
magnets provides the stability of two-dimensional (2D) solitons with identical
energies but opposite topological charges. These skyrmions and antiskyrmions
represent metastable states in a wide range of parameters above the transition
into the saturated ferromagnetic phase. The symmetry of the underlying
micromagnetic functional gives rise to soliton zero modes allowing efficient
control of their translational movement by the frequency of the circulating
external magnetic field. We also discuss the role of demagnetizing fields in
the energy balance between skyrmion and antiskyrmion and in their stability.

<h3>Structural Phase Transition and Superconductivity in 2H-BaGaGe with  Buckled Honeycomb Layers</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on the structural and superconducting properties of the
intermetallic compound BaGaGe. We find that this material undergoes a
structural second-order phase transition from the distorted AlB$_2$-type
structure (1H, $a$ = 4.3254(2) \r{A}, $c$ = 5.1078(3) \r{A}, P6/mmm) into the
CaIn$_2$-type structure (2H, $a$ = 4.3087(3) \r{A}, $c$ = 10.2117(6) \r{A},
P6$_3$/mmc) at a transition temperature of $T_{\rm S}$ = 253 K. We find that
the structural phase-transition corresponds to a coherent buckling of the
honeycomb layers, which we can interpret as a disorder-to-order transition of
the atoms located within this layer. We show that the 2H-BaGaGe phase becomes
superconducting at a critical temperature of $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1 K. The bulk
nature of the superconductivity in 2H-BaGaGe is confirmed by means of specific
heat measurements, where we determine a value of $\Delta C$/$\gamma T_{\rm c}$
= 1.59, which is close to the expected BCS value in the weak coupling limit.

<h3>Lifetime of coexisting sub-10 nm zero-field skyrmions and antiskyrmions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions have raised high hopes for future spintronic devices. For
many applications it would be of great advantage to have more than one
metastable particle-like texture available. The coexistence of skyrmions and
antiskyrmions has been proposed in inversion symmetric magnets with exchange
frustration. However, so far only model systems have been studied and the
lifetime of coexisting metastable topological spin structures has not been
obtained. Here, we predict that skyrmions and antiskyrmions with diameters
below 10 nm can coexist at zero magnetic field in a Rh/Co bilayer on the
Ir(111) surface -- an experimentally feasible system. We show that the
lifetimes of metastable skyrmions and antiskyrmions in the ferromagnetic ground
state are above one hour for temperatures up to 75 K and 48 K, respectively.
The entropic contribution to the nucleation and annihilation rates differs for
skyrmions and antiskyrmions. This opens the route to thermally activated
creation of coexisting skyrmions and antiskyrmions in frustrated magnets with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

<h3>Transferable screened range-separated hybrid functionals for electronic  and optical properties of van der Waals materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
The accurate description of electronic properties and optical absorption
spectra is a long-standing challenge for density functional theory. Recently,
the introduction of screened range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals for
solid-state materials has allowed for the calculation of fundamental band gaps
and optical absorption spectra that are in very good agreement with many-body
perturbation theory. However, since solid-state SRSH functionals are typically
tuned to reproduce the properties of bulk phases, their transferability to
low-dimensional structures, which experience substantially different screening
than in the bulk, remains an open question. In this work, we explore the
transferability of SRSH functionals to several prototypical van der Waals
materials, including transition-metal sulfides and selenides, indium selenide,
black phosphorus, and hexagonal boron nitride. Considering the bulk and a
monolayer of these materials as limiting cases, we show that the parameters of
the SRSH functional can be determined systematically, using only the band-edge
quasiparticle energies of these extremal structural phases as fitting targets.
The resulting SRSH functionals can describe both electronic bandstructures and
optical absorption spectra with accuracy comparable to more demanding ab initio
many-body perturbation theory (GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation) approaches.
Selected examples also demonstrate that the SRSH parameters, obtained from the
bulk and monolayer reference structures, display good accuracy for
bandstructures and optical spectra of bilayers, indicating a degree of
transferability that is independent of the fitting procedure.

<h3>Polariton-dark exciton interactions in bistable semiconductor  microcavities</h3>

<br>
<i>Elena Rozas, Evgeny Sedov, Yannik Brune, Sven Höfling, Alexey Kavokin, Marc Aßmann</i>
<br>
<br>
We take advantage of the polariton bistability in semiconductor microcavities
to estimate the interaction strength between lower exciton-polariton and dark
exciton states. We combine the quasiresonant excitation of polaritons and the
nominally forbidden two-photon excitation (TPE) of dark excitons in a GaAs
microcavity. To this end, we use an ultranarrow linewidth cw laser for the TPE
process that allows us to determine the energy of dark excitons with high
spectral resolution. Our results evidence a sharp drop in the polariton
transmission intensity and width of the hysteresis cycle when the TPE process
is resonant with the dark exciton energy, highly compromising the bistability
of the polariton condensate. This behavior demonstrates the existence of a
small symmetry breaking such as that produced by an effective in-plane magnetic
field, allowing us to directly excite the dark reservoir. We numerically
reproduce the collapse of the hysteresis cycle with the increasing dark exciton
population, treating the evolution of a polariton condensate in a one-mode
approximation, coupled to the exciton reservoir via polariton-exciton
scattering processes.

<h3>An FFT-based framework for predicting corrosion-driven damage in fractal  porous media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13081</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Understanding fracture in cementitious materials caused by the deposition and
growth of corrosion products requires scale-bridging approaches due to the
large length-scale difference between the micro-pores, where deposition occurs,
and the structure, where deterioration manifests. Cementitious materials bear a
highly heterogeneous micro-structure owing to the fractal nature of
micro-pores. Simultaneously, a corrosion-driven fracture is a multi-physics
problem involving ionic diffusion, chemical reactions, and stress development.
This multi-scale and multi-physical character makes scale-bridging studies
computationally costly, often leading to the use of simplified fractal porous
media, which has important consequences for the quantitative interpretation of
the results. Recent advances in homogenization approaches using
Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) based methods have raised interest due to their
ease of implementation and low computational cost. This paper presents an
FFT-based framework for solving corrosion-driven fractures within fractal
porous media. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fourier-based spectral
method in resolving the multiple corrosion-driven mechanisms such as ionic
diffusion, stress development, and damage within a fractal porous
microstructure. Based on the presented methodology, we analyze the impact of
simplifying fractal porous media with simple Euclidean geometry on
corrosion-driven fracture. Our results demonstrate the importance of preserving
both the porosity and fractal nature of pores for precise and reliable modeling
of corrosion-driven failure mechanisms.

<br>
<br>
For open quantum systems, integration of the bath degrees of freedom using
the second order cumulant expansion in the Keldysh path integral provides an
alternative derivation of the effective action for systems coupled to general
baths. The baths can be interacting and not necessarily Markovian. Using this
method in the Markovian limit, we compute the particle loss dynamics in various
models of ultra-cold atomic gases including a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard
model with two-particle losses and a multi-component Fermi gas with
interactions tuned by an optical Feshbach resonance. We explicitly demonstrate
that the limit of strong two-body losses can be treated by formulating an
indirect loss scheme to describe the bath-system coupling. The particle-loss
dynamics thus obtained is valid at all temperatures. For the one-dimensional
Bose-Hubbard model, we compare it to solutions of the phenomenological rate
equations. The latter are shown to be accurate at high temperatures.

<br>
<br>
The piezoelectric response is a measure of the sensitivity of a material's
polarization to stress or its strain to an applied field. Using in-operando
x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging, we observe that topological vortices
are the source of a five-fold enhancement of the piezoelectric response near
the vortex core. The vortices form where several low symmetry ferroelectric
phases and phase boundaries coalesce. Unlike bulk ferroelectric solid solutions
in which a large piezoelectric response is associated with coexisting phases in
the proximity of the triple point, the largest responses for pure BaTiO3 at the
nanoscale are in spatial regions of extremely small spontaneous polarization at
vortex cores. The response decays inversely with polarization away from the
vortex, analogous to the behavior in bulk ceramics as the cation compositions
are varied away from the triple point. We use first-principles-based molecular
dynamics to augment our observations, and our results suggest that nanoscale
piezoelectric materials with large piezoelectric response can be designed
within a parameter space governed by vortex cores. Our findings have
implications for the development of next-generation nanoscale piezoelectric
materials.

We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the zero-field Blume-Capel
model in the vicinity of its tricritical point (TCP). We calculate the
quadrupole moment, internal energy, and entropy densities employing an exact
numerical recursion procedure for the model defined on a hierarchical lattice
of fractal dimension $d$. We explore the scaling behavior of the isothermal
quadrupolar susceptibility and, the isothermal and constant crystal-field
specific heat as a function of the temperature and the reduced crystal-field
parameter along the ferromagnetic and the \emph{ordered paramagnetic} phase
frontier. Results achieved for systems with dimensions $d=2$ and $3$ exhibit
the main features of the continuous and first-order transitions in the TCP
neighborhoods. We also probe the phase coexistence in the $\lambda$-diagram and
the latent heat in the vicinity of the tricritical point locus.

<br>
<i>David W. Kanaar, J. P. Kestner</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are a promising platform for
quantum computing, however scaling to large systems is hampered by crosstalk
and charge noise. Crosstalk here refers to the unwanted off-resonant rotation
of idle qubits during the resonant rotation of the target qubit. For a
three-qubit system with crosstalk and charge noise, it is difficult to
analytically create gate protocols that produce three-qubit gates, such as the
Toffoli gate, directly in a single shot instead of through the composition of
two-qubit gates. Therefore, we numerically optimize a physics-informed neural
network to produce theoretically robust shaped pulses that generate a
Toffoli-equivalent gate. Additionally, robust $\frac{\pi}{2}$ $X$ and CZ gates
are also presented in this work to create a universal set of gates robust
against charge noise. The robust pulses maintain an infidelity of $10^{-3}$ for
average quasistatic fluctuations in the voltage of up to a few mV instead of
tenths of mV for non-robust pulses.

<br>
<br>
Quantum Hall systems host chiral edge states extending along the
one-dimensional boundary of any two-dimensional sample. In solid state
materials, the edge states serve as perfectly robust transport channels that
produce a quantised Hall conductance; due to their chirality, and the
topological protection by the Chern number of the bulk bandstructure, they
cannot be spatially localized by defects or disorder. Here, we show
experimentally that the chiral edge states of a lossy quantum Hall system can
be localized. In a gyromagnetic photonic crystal exhibiting the quantum Hall
topological phase, an appropriately structured loss configuration imparts the
edge states' complex energy spectrum with a feature known as point-gap winding.
This intrinsically non-Hermitian topological invariant is distinct from the
Chern number invariant of the bulk (which remains intact) and induces mode
localization via the "non-Hermitian skin effect". The interplay of the two
topological phenomena - the Chern number and point-gap winding - gives rise to
a non-Hermitian generalisation of the paradigmatic Chern-type bulk-boundary
correspondence principle. Compared to previous realisations of the
non-Hermitian skin effect, the skin modes in this system have superior
robustness against local defects and disorders.

<br>
<br>
Spin qubits defined by valence band hole states comprise an attractive
candidate for quantum information processing due to their inherent coupling to
electric fields enabling fast and scalable qubit control. In particular, heavy
holes in germanium have shown great promise, with recent demonstrations of fast
and high-fidelity qubit operations. However, the mechanisms and anisotropies
that underlie qubit driving and decoherence are still mostly unclear. Here, we
report on the highly anisotropic heavy-hole $g$-tensor and its dependence on
electric fields, allowing us to relate both qubit driving and decoherence to an
electric modulation of the $g$-tensor. We also confirm the predicted Ising-type
hyperfine interaction but show that qubit coherence is ultimately limited by
$1/f$ charge noise. Finally, we operate the qubit at low magnetic field and
measure a dephasing time of $T_2^*=9.2$ ${\mu}$s, while maintaining a
single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.94 %, that remains well above 99 % at an
operation temperature T>1 K. This understanding of qubit driving and
decoherence mechanisms are key for the design and operation of scalable and
highly coherent hole qubit arrays.

We theoretically investigate the lattice relaxation and the electronic
property in non-symemtric chiral TTGs by using an effective continuum model.
The relaxed lattice structure forms a patchwork of moir\'e-of-moir\'e domains,
where the moir\'e patterns given by layer 1 and 2, and layer 2 and 3 become
locally commensurate with a specific relative alignment. The band calculation
reveals a wide energy window (> 50 meV) with low density of states, featuring
sparsely distributed highly one-dimensional electron bands. The wave function
of these one-dimensional bands exhibits sharp localization at the boundaries
between super-moir\'e domains. By calculating the Chern number of the local
band structure within commensurate domains, the one-dimensional state is
identified as a topological boundary state between distinct Chern insulators.

The vortex in the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathrm{O}(2)$ model is studied via

Many natural and artificial reactions including photosynthesis or
photopolymerization are initiated by stimulating organic molecules into an
excited state, which enables new reaction paths. Controlling light-matter
interaction can influence this key concept of photochemistry, however, it
remained a challenge to apply this strategy to control photochemical reactions
at the atomic scale. Here, we profit from the extreme confinement of the
electromagnetic field at the apex of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip
to drive and control the rate of a free-base phthalocyanine
phototautomerization with submolecular precision. By tuning the laser
excitation wavelength and choosing the STM tip position, we control the
phototautomerization rate and the relative tautomer population. This
sub-molecular optical control can be used to study any other photochemical
processes.

We experimentally test a recently proposed holographic method for imaging
coherent light scatterers which are distributed over a 2-dimensional grid. In
our setup the scatterers consist of a back-illuminated, opaque mask with
submicron-sized holes. We study how the imaging fidelity depends on various
parameters of the set-up. We observe that a few hundred scattered photons per
hole already suffice to obtain a fidelity of 96% to correctly determine whether
a hole is located at a given grid point. The holographic method demonstrated
here has a high potential for applications with ultracold atoms in optical
lattices.

Plasmons can be excited during photoemission and produce spectral
photoelectron features that yield information on the nanoscale optical response
of the probed materials. However, these so-called plasmon satellites have so
far been observed only for planar surfaces, while their potential for the
characterization of nanostructures remains unexplored. Here, we theoretically
demonstrate that core-level photoemission from nanostructures can display
spectrally narrow plasmonic features, reaching relatively high probabilities
similar to the direct peak. Using a nonperturbative quantum-mechanical
framework, we find a dramatic effect of nanostructure morphology and
dimensionality as well as a universal scaling law for the plasmon-satellite
probabilities. In addition, we introduce a pump--probe scheme in which plasmons
are optically excited prior to photoemission, leading to plasmon losses and
gains in the photoemission spectra and granting us access into the ultrafast
dynamics of the sampled nanostructure. These results emphasize the potential of
plasmon satellites to explore multi-plasmon effects and ultrafast
electron--plasmon dynamics in metal-based nanoparticles and two-dimensional
nanoislands.

1.0 and 2.5 MeV, whence sample resistance was measured in-situ at 22 K. For all
energies, the resistivity raises linearly with the irradiation fluence
suggesting the creation of uncorrelated dilute point-like disorder (confirmed
by simulations). The rate of the resistivity increase peaks at energies below
1.5 MeV. Comparison with calculated partial cross-sections points to the
predominant creation of defects in the iron sublattice. Simultaneously,
superconducting $T_c$, measured separately between the irradiation runs, is
monotonically suppressed as expected since it depends on the total scattering
rate, hence total cross-section, which is a monotonically increasing function
of energy. Our work confirms experimentally an often-made assumption of the
dominant role of the iron sub-lattice in iron-based superconductors.

(2+1)-D chiral topological phases are often identified by studying low-lying
entanglement spectra (ES) of their wavefunctions on long cylinders of finite
circumference. For chiral topological states that possess global
$\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry, we can now understand, as shown in this work, the
nature of the topological phase from the study of the splittings of
degeneracies in the finite-size ES, at a given momentum, solely from the
perspective of conformal field theory (CFT). This is a finer diagnostic than
Li-Haldane "state-counting", extending the approach of PRB 106, 035138 (2022)
by two of the authors. We contrast ES of such chiral topological states with
those of a non-chiral PEPS (Kure\v{c}i\'c, Sterdyniak, and Schuch [PRB 99,
045116 (2019)]) also possessing $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry. That latter PEPS has
the same discrete symmetry as the chiral PEPS: strong breaking of separate
time-reversal and reflection symmetries, with invariance under the product of
these two operations. However, the full analysis of the topological sectors of
the ES of the latter PEPS in prior work [arXiv:2207.03246] shows lack of
chirality, as would be manifested, e.g., by a vanishing chiral central charge.
In the present work, we identify a distinct indicator and hallmark of chirality
in the ES: the splittings of conjugate irreps. We prove that in the ES of the
chiral states conjugate irreps are exactly degenerate, because the operators
[related to the cubic Casimir invariant of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$] that would split
them are forbidden. By contrast, in the ES of non-chiral states, conjugate
splittings are demonstrably non-vanishing. Such a diagnostic significantly
simplifies identification of non-chirality in low-energy finite-size ES for
$\mathrm{SU}(3)$-symmetric topological states.

Ferroelectric materials exhibit interesting electric, mechanical and optical
properties. Particularly,tin-film lead zirconium titanate (PZT) has been used
as a standard piezo-electric material in micro-electro-mechanical systems.
Interestingly, it has one of the highest electro-optic properties that can be
exploited to make high-speed on-chip light modulators. In this work, we
demonstrate sputter-deposited PZT on silicon-on-insulator wafers. Desired phase
and film morphology is achieved through process and buffer layer engineering.
We present results on buffer layer screening between MgO, TiO2 and Pt. MgO is
identified as a suitable buffer layer from an optical and film growth
perspective. We achieve a measured coercive field for PZT/MgO and PZT/Pt film
is 50 kV/cm and 30 kV/cm, respectively. We use a PZT-loaded ring modulator with
an electro-optic response of 14 pm/V.

Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnets are prominent playgrounds for developing
magnetoelectric, magneto-optic and spintronic devices. In spintronics,
particularly in spincaloritronic applications, low thermal conductivity
($\kappa$) is highly desired. Here, by combining thermal transport measurements
with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate low $\kappa$ down
to 1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ in a typical vdW ferromagnet Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$. In
the paramagnetic state, development of magnetic fluctuations way above
$T_\mathrm{c}=$ 33 K strongly reduces $\kappa$ via spin-phonon scattering,
leading to low $\kappa \sim$ 1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ over a wide temperature
range, in comparable to that of amorphous silica. In the magnetically ordered
state, emergence of resonant magnon-phonon scattering limits $\kappa$ below
$\sim$ 2 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, which would be three times larger if magnetic
scatterings were absent. Application of magnetic fields strongly suppresses the
spin-phonon scattering, giving rise to large enhancements of $\kappa$. Our
calculations well capture these complex behaviours of $\kappa$ by taking the
temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent spin-phonon scattering into account.
Realization of low $\kappa$ which is easily tunable by magnetic fields in
Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, may further promote spincaloritronic applications of vdW
magnets. Our theoretical approach may also provide a generic understanding of
spin-phonon scattering, which appears to play important roles in various
systems.

The Yang-Lee edge singularity is a prototypical example of the application of
renormalization group ideas to critical behavior, and one to which Michael
Fisher made several important contributions. Moreover it has connections to
several other problems such as the statistics of branched polymers, and its
scaling limit in two dimensions provides a simple example of integrable field
theory. This article aims to give a pedagogical introduction to these matters,
with a few new ideas thrown in.
