<h3>The Countoscope: Measuring Self and Collective Dynamics without  Trajectories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00647" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00647</a>

Microscopy can now resolve complex systems at the single particle level, from
cellular organisms to individual ions. The scientific community thus shares a
common interest in quantifying particle dynamics from images. Yet, available
analysis techniques face challenges reconstructing trajectories in dense and
heterogeneous systems where accurately labelling particles is difficult.
Furthermore, the inescapable finite field of view of experiments hinders the
measurement of collective effects central to biological or active systems.
Inspired by Smoluchowski, we introduce a broadly applicable analysis technique
that probes dynamics simply by counting particles in finite observation boxes.
Using colloidal experiments, simulations, and theory, we first demonstrate that
statistical properties of fluctuating counts can be used to determine
self-diffusion coefficients, including the effect of hydrodynamic interactions,
so alleviating the hurdles associated with trajectory reconstruction. We
subsequently show that by increasing the observation box size, counting
naturally enables the study of collective dynamics. Using our novel analysis of
particle counts, we uncover a surprising enhancement of collective behaviour,
as well as a new, fundamental length scale associated with hyperuniform
structure. Our counting framework, the Countoscope, thus liberates experiments
from finite fields of view and enables efficient collective dynamics
measurements, opening the way to study diverse complex systems.

<h3>Stable many-body localization under random continuous measurements in  the no-click limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00019" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00019</a>

In this work, we investigate the localization properties of a paradigmatic
model, coupled to a monitoring environment and possessing a many-body localized
(MBL) phase. We focus on the post-selected no-click limit with quench random
rates, i.e., random gains and losses. In this limit, the system is modeled by
adding an imaginary random potential, rendering non-Hermiticity in the system.
Numerically, we provide an evidence that the system is localized for any finite
amount of disorder. To analytically understand our results, we extend the
quantum random energy model (QREM) to the non-Hermitian scenario. The Hermitian
QREM has been used previously as a benchmark model for MBL. The QREM exhibits a
size-dependent MBL transition, where the critical value scales as $W_c\sim
\sqrt{L} \ln{L}$ with system size and presenting many-body mobility edges. We
reveal that the non-Hermitian QREM with random gain-loss offers a significantly
stronger form of localization, evident in the nature of the many-body mobility
edges and the value for the transition, which scales as $W_c\sim \ln^{1/2}{L}$
with the system size.

<h3>Complex orders and chirality in the classical Kitaev-$Î“$ model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00037" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00037</a>

<br>
It is well-recognized that the low-energy physics of many Kitaev materials is
governed by two dominant energy scales, the Ising-like Kitaev coupling $K$ and
the symmetric off-diagonal $\Gamma$ coupling. An understanding of the interplay
between these two scales is therefore the natural starting point toward a
quantitative description that includes sub-dominant perturbations that are
inevitably present in real materials. The present study focuses on the
classical $K$-$\Gamma$ model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific emphasis
on the region $K<0$ and $\Gamma>0$, which is the most relevant for the
available materials and which remains enigmatic in both quantum and classical
limits, despite much effort. We employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on
specially designed finite-size clusters and unravel the presence of a complex
multi-sublattice magnetic orders in a wide region of the phase diagram, whose
structure is characterized in detail. We show that this order can be quantified
in terms of a coarse-grained scalar-chirality order, featuring a
counter-rotating modulation on the two spin sublattices. We also provide a
comparison to previous studies and discuss the impact of quantum fluctuations
on the phase diagram.

<h3>Temperature dependence of energy transport in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral  clock model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00046" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00046</a>

<br>
<br>
We employ matrix product state simulations to study energy transport within
the non-integrable regime of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock
model. To induce a non-equilibrium steady state throughout the system, we
consider open system dynamics with boundary driving featuring jump operators
with adjustable temperature and footprint in the system. Given a steady state,
we diagnose the effective local temperature by minimizing the trace distance
between the true local state and the local state of a uniform thermal ensemble.
Via a scaling analysis, we extract the transport coefficients of the model at
relatively high temperatures above both its gapless and gapped low-temperature
phases. In the medium-to-high temperature regime we consider, diffusive
transport is observed regardless of the low-temperature physics. We calculate
the temperature dependence of the energy diffusion constant as a function of
model parameters, including in the regime where the model is quantum critical
at the low temperature. Notably, even within the gapless regime, an analysis
based on power series expansion implies that intermediate-temperature transport
can be accessed within a relatively confined setup. Although we are not yet
able to reach temperatures where quantum critical scaling would be observed,
our approach is able to access the transport properties of the model over a
broad range of temperatures and parameters. We conclude by discussing the
limitations of our method and potential extensions that could expand its scope,
for example, to even lower temperatures.

<h3>Classification of 1+1D gapless symmetry protected phases via topological  holography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00050" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00050</a>

<br>
<br>
Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) gives a holographic correspondence
between systems with a global symmetry and a higher-dimensional topological
field theory. In this framework, classification of gapped phases of matter in
spacetime dimension 1+1D correspond to classifications of mechanisms to confine
the SymTFT by condensing anyons. In this work, we extend these results to
characterize gapless symmetry-protected topological states: symmetry-enriched
gapless phases or critical points that exhibit edge modes protected by symmetry
and topology. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between 1+1D bosonic
gSPTs, and partially-confined boundaries of 2+1D SymTFTs. From general physical
considerations, we determine the set of data and consistency conditions
required to define a 1+1D gSPT, and show that this data precisely matches that
of symmetry-preserving partial confinement (or partially gapped boundaries) of
2+1D quantum double models. We illustrate this correspondence through a
dimensional reduction (thin-slab) construction, which enables a
physically-intuitive derivation of how properties of the gSPT such as edge
modes, emergent anomalies, and stability to perturbations arise from the SymTFT
perspective.ditions required to define a 1+1D gSPT and show that they fully
determine the physics of the gSPT including edge modes and emergent anomaly.

<br>
We report muon spin rotation (muSR) measurements of the temperature
dependence of the absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth and the
magnetic field dependence of the vortex core size in the mixed state of the
non-symmorphic superconductor LaNiGa2. The temperature dependence of the
normalized superfluid density is shown to be well described by a two-band model
with strong interband coupling. Consistent with a strong coupling of the
superconducting condensates in two different bands, we show that the field
dependence of the vortex core size resembles that of a single-band
superconductor. Our results lend support to the proposal that LaNiGa2 is a
fully-gapped, internally antisymmetric nonunitary spin-triplet superconductor.

The Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has generated great interest in the
community due to its possible field-induced Kitaev quantum spin liquid state.
Despite enormous effort spent trying to obtain the form of the low energy
Hamiltonian, there is currently no agreed upon set of parameters which is able
to explain all of the data. A key piece of missing information lies in the
determination of the magnetic form factor of Ru$^{3+}$, particularly for a true
quantitative treatment of inelastic neutron scattering data. Here we present
the experimentally derived magnetic form factor of Ru$^{3+}$ in the low spin
4$d^5$ state using polarized neutron diffraction within the paramagnetic regime
on high quality single crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We observe strong
evidence of an anisotropic form factor, expected of the spin-orbit coupled
$j_{\textrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We model the static
magnetization density in increasing complexity from simple isotropic cases, to
a multipolar expansion, and finally \emph{ab initio} calculations of the
generalized $j_{\textrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2}$ ground state. Comparison of both
single ion models and inclusion of Cl$^-$ anions support the presence of
hybridization of Ru$^{3+}$ with the surrounding Cl$^{-}$ ligands.

<h3>Dynamical characterization of $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases via  quantum quenches</h3>

The complete characterization of Floquet topological phases is usually hard
for the requirement of information about the micromotion throughout the entire
driving period. Here we develop a full and feasible dynamical characterization
theory for the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases by quenching the system from
a trivial and static initial state to the Floquet topological regime through
suddenly changing the parameters and turning on the periodic driving. By
measuring the minimal information of Floquet bands via the stroboscopic
time-averaged spin polarizations, we show that the topological spin texture
patterns emerging on certain discrete momenta of Brillouin zone called the $0$
or $\pi$ gap highest-order band-inversion surfaces provide a measurable
dynamical $Z_{2}$ Floquet invariant, which uniquely determines the Floquet
boundary modes in the corresponding quasienergy gap. The applications of our
theory are illustrated via one- and two-dimensional models that are accessible
in current quantum simulation experiments. Our work provides a highly feasible
way to detect the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases and shall advance the
experimental studies.

<h3>Non-equilibrium Onsager-Machlup theory</h3>

<br>
This paper proposes a simple mathematical model of non-stationary and
non-linear stochastic dynamics, which approximates a (globally) non-stationary
and non-linear stochastic process by its locally (or \emph{"piecewise"})
stationary version. Profiting from the elegance and simplicity of both, the
exact mathematical model referred to as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic
process (which is \emph{globally} stationary, Markov and Gaussian) and of the
Lyapunov criterion associated with the stability of stationarity, we show that
the proposed non-linear non-stationary model provides a natural extension of
the Onsager-Machlup theory of equilibrium thermal fluctuations, to the realm of
non-stationary, non-linear, and non-equilibrium processes. As an illustrative
application, we then apply the extended non-equilibrium Onsager-Machlup theory,
to the description of thermal fluctuations and irreversible relaxation
processes in liquids, leading to the main exact equations employed to construct
the \emph{non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation}
(NE-SCGLE) theory of irreversible processes in liquids. This generic theory has
demonstrated that the most intriguing and long-unsolved questions of the glass
and the gel transitions are understood as a natural consequence of the second
law of thermodynamics, enunciated in terms of the proposed piecewise stationary
stochastic mathematical model.

<h3>Unveiling a Novel Silicene-Like Material: A DFT Study on  Pentahexoctite-Silicon and Its Optoelectronic Characteristics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00124</a>

<br>
<br>
Silicon-based two-dimensional (2D) materials, including well-known silicene,
have garnered considerable attention due to their potential in advanced
electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we introduce a novel 2D
silicon variant, pentahexoctite silicon (PH-Si), inspired by the unique
structural attributes of pentahexoctite carbon. By using state-of-the-art
density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) simulations, we investigated the fundamental optoelectronic traits of
PH-Si. Our findings unveil that PH-Si boasts promising electronic properties
characterized by anisotropic conductance and metallic behavior along specific
directions. We also examine its structural and dynamic stability through phonon
calculations and AIMD simulations. PH-Si structural stability was also
confirmed by its low formation energy of -3.62 eV. The material exhibits
substantial optical absorption in visible (Vis) and ultraviolet (UV) spectral
regions, positioning it as a potential Vis-UV detector and absorber.
Additionally, we assess its crucial mechanical attributes, encompassing elastic
stiffness constants, Young's modulus (ranging from 5 to 40 GPa), and a Poisson
ratio of 0.8, collectively offering valuable insights into its mechanical
performance.

<h3>Non-destructive tomographic nanoscale imaging of ferroelectric domain  walls</h3>

Extraordinary physical properties arise at polar interfaces in oxide
materials, including the emergence of two-dimensional electron gases,
sheet-superconductivity, and multiferroicity. A special type of polar interface
are ferroelectric domain walls, where electronic reconstruction phenomena can
be driven by bound charges. Great progress has been achieved in the
characterization of such domain walls and, over the last decade, their
potential for next-generation nanotechnology has become clear. Established
tomography techniques, however, are either destructive or offer insufficient
spatial resolution, creating a pressing demand for 3D imaging compatible with
future fabrication processes. Here, we demonstrate non-destructive tomographic
imaging of ferroelectric domain walls using secondary electrons. Utilizing
conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we reconstruct the position,
orientation, and charge state of hidden domain walls at distances up to several
hundreds of nanometers away from the surface. A mathematical model is derived
that links the SEM intensity variations at the surface to the local domain wall
properties, enabling non-destructive tomography with good noise tolerance on
the timescale of seconds. Our SEM-based approach facilitates high-throughput
screening of materials with functional domain walls and domain-wall-based
devices, which is essential for monitoring during the production of device
architectures and quality control in real-time.

We report a study of the electron transport (ET) properties at the nanoscale
(conductive-AFM noted C-AFM thereafter) of individual Prussian Blue Analog
(PBA) cubic nanocrystals (NCs) of CsCo(III)Fe(II), with size between 15 and 50
nm deposited on HOPG. We demonstrate that these PBA NCs feature an almost size
independent electron injection barriers of 0.41 +/- 0.02 eV and 0.27 +/- 0.03
eV at the CsCo(III)Fe(II)/HOPG and CsCo(III)Fe(II)/C-AFM tip, respectively, and
an intrinsic electron conductivity evolving from largely dispersed between ca.
5E-4 and 2E-2 S/cm without a clear correlation with the nanocrystal size. The
conductivity values measured on individual nanocrystals are higher by up to 5
decades than those reported on PBA films.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic Switching in Mn$_2$Au Using a Novel Laser Induced  Optical Torque on Ultrafast Timescales</h3>

<br>
<br>
Efficient manipulation of the N\'eel vector in antiferromagnets can be
induced by generation of spin orbit (SOT) or spin-transfer (STT) torques. Here
we predict another possibility for antiferromagnetic domain switching by using
a non-zero staggered field induced from optical laser excitation. We present
results on the atomistic scale dynamic simulations from the application of a
novel laser induced torque using optical frequencies for all-optical switching
(AOS) of the N\'eel vector in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au. The driving
mechanism takes advantage of the sizeable 'exchange enhancement' characteristic
of antiferromagnets, allowing for small picosecond 90 and 180 degree
precessional switching with laser fluences on the order of mJ/cm$^2$. The
symmetry of these novel torques are highly dependent on the time-varying
magnetisation direction, creating a sign change in the torque which greatly
minimises the "over-shooting problem" common to SOT and STT. Lastly, we
demonstrate the opportunity for this laser optical torque to deterministically
switch single magnetic domains.

<h3>Trapped Bose-Einstein condensates with nonlinear coherent modes</h3>

<i>V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova, V.S. Bagnato</i>
<br>
<br>
The review presents the methods of generation of nonlinear coherent
excitations in strongly nonequilibrium Bose-condensed systems of trapped atoms
and their properties. Non-ground-state Bose-Einstein condensates are
represented by nonlinear coherent modes. The principal difference of nonlinear
coherent modes from linear collective excitations is emphasized. Methods of
generating nonlinear modes and the properties of the latter are described.
Matter-wave interferometry with coherent modes is discussed, including such
effects as interference patterns, internal Josephson current, Rabi
oscillations, Ramsey fringes, harmonic generation, and parametric conversion.
Dynamic transition between mode-locked and mode-unlocked regimes is shown to be
analogous to a phase transition. Atomic squeezing and entanglement in a lattice
of condensed atomic clouds with coherent modes are considered. Nonequilibrium
states of trapped Bose-condensed systems, starting from weakly nonequilibrium
state, vortex state, vortex turbulence, droplet or grain turbulence, and wave
turbulence, are classified by means of effective Fresnel and Mach numbers. The
inverse Kibble-Zurek scenario is described. A method for the formation of
directed beams from atom lasers is reported.

<h3>Experimental Demonstration of Coupled Learning in Elastic Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00170</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Coupled learning is a contrastive scheme for tuning the properties of
individual elements within a network in order to achieve desired functionality
of the system. It takes advantage of physics both to learn using local rules
and to "compute" the output response to input data, thus enabling the system to
perform decentralized computation without the need for a processor or external
memory. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept mechanical network that can learn
simple tasks such as self-symmetrizing via iterative tuning of individual
spring rest lengths. These mechanical networks could feasibly be scaled and
automated to solve increasingly complex tasks, hinting at a new class of
"smart" metamaterials.

<h3>Observing periodic gap variations in cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00178</a>
<br>
<i>Riju Banerjee, Emily L. Wang, Eric W. Hudson</i>
<br>
<br>
Central to the enigma of the cuprates is ubiquitous electronic inhomogeneity
arising from a variety of electronic orders that coexist with
superconductivity, the individual signatures of which have been impossible to
disentangle despite four decades of intense research. This strong nanoscale
inhomogeneity complicates interpretation of measurements both by probes which
average over this inhomogeneity and those, like scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM), which should be able to spatially resolve variations driven by both
order and inhomogeneity. Here, we develop a novel technique that directly
acknowledges this electronic inhomogeneity and extracts statistically
significant features from scanning tunneling spectroscopic data. Applying our
novel technique to single and bilayer Bi-based cuprates spanning a large doping
range, we peer through local inhomogeneities and find that the gap breaks
translational and rotational symmetries and varies periodically in a four-fold
pattern. Our direct observation of a symmetry breaking gap in the single
particle tunneling spectra adds strong credence to the pair density wave
hypotheses supposed to exist in these materials. We also discuss various
implications of our observations and, in particular, how they can explain the
origin of the low energy checkerboard pattern.

<h3>Quantum coherence effects on inelastic thermoelectric devices: From  diodes to transistors</h3>

We present a study on inelastic thermoelectric devices, wherein charge
currents and electronic and phononic heat currents are intricately
interconnected. The employment of double quantum dots in conjunction with a
phonon bath positions them as promising candidates for quantum thermoelectric
diodes and transistors. Within this study, we illustrate that quantum coherence
effects yield significant charge and Seebeck rectification effects. It's worth
noting that, while the thermal transistor effect is observable in the linear
response regime, especially when phonon-assisted inelastic processes dominate
the transport, quantum coherence does not enhance thermal amplification. Our
work provides valuable insights for the optimization of general thermoelectric
devices.

<h3>Effect of annealing in eutectic high-entropy alloy superconductor  NbScTiZr</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00195" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00195</a>
<br>
<i>Takeru Seki, Hiroto Arima, Yuta Kawasaki, Terukazu Nishizaki, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Jiro Kitagawa</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigated the impact of annealing on the structural characteristics and
superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of the eutectic
high-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductor NbScTiZr. The HEA manifests an eutectic
microstructure composed of body-centered cubic (bcc) and hexagonal close-packed
phases. Both the lattice parameters of the bcc phase and grain size of the
eutectic structure exhibited pronounced sensitivity to variations in annealing
temperature. The observed dependence of the lattice parameter on annealing
temperature supports the possibility that lattice strain occurs at lower
annealing temperatures. The as-cast sample demonstrated superconductivity at
$T_\mathrm{c}$ of 7.9 K, which increased to 9 K after annealing at 800
$^{\circ}$C. However, when subjected to annealing at 1000 $^{\circ}$C,
$T_\mathrm{c}$ diminishes to 8.7 K. The annealing-temperature dependence of
$T_\mathrm{c}$ cannot be comprehensively elucidated based solely on the
electronic density of states at the Fermi level. It is plausible that the
lattice strain may influence the annealing temperature dependence of
$T_\mathrm{c}$. Our results for the critical current density $J_{c}$ reveal
that the self-field $J_{c}$ of the as-cast NbScTiZr at 2 K exceeds 10$^{6}$
A/cm$^{2}$.

A practical quantitative model is presented to account for the I-V
characteristics of pin diodes based on epitaxial Ge-like materials. The model
can be used to quantify how the different material properties and recombination
mechanisms affect the diode performance. The importance of dislocations,
non-passivated defects, and residual intrinsic layer doping in determining the
qualitative shape of the I-V curves is discussed in detail. Examples are shown
covering literature diodes as well as diodes fabricated with the purpose of
validating the theoretical effort.

<h3>Performance limits to graphene single-photon bolometers by thermal  transport</h3>

<br>
<br>
In high-sensitivity bolometers and calorimeters, the photon absorption often
occurs at a finite distance from the temperature sensor to accommodate antennas
or avoid the degradation of superconducting circuitry exposed to radiation. As
a result, thermal propagation from the input to the temperature readout can
critically affect detector performance. In this report we model the performance
of a graphene bolometer, accounting for electronic thermal diffusion and
dissipation via electron-phonon coupling at low temperatures in three regimes:
clean, supercollision, and resonant scattering. Our results affirm the
feasibility of a superconducting readout without Cooper-pair breaking by mid-
and near-infrared photons, and provide a recipe for designing graphene
absorbers for calorimetric single-photon detectors. We investigate the tradeoff
between the input-readout distance and detector efficiency, and predict an
intrinsic timing jitter of ~2.7 ps. Based on our result, we propose a
spatial-mode-resolving photon detector to increase communication bandwidth.

<h3>Tuning of Berry Curvature Dipole in TaAs slabs: An effective Route to  Enhance Nonlinear Hall Response</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00247" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00247</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In materials without inversion symmetry, Berry curvature dipole (BCD) arises
from the uneven distribution of Berry curvature in momentum space. This leads
to nonlinear anomalous Hall effects even in systems with preserved
time-reversal symmetry. A key goal is to engineer systems with prominent BCD
near the Fermi level. Notably, TaAs, a type-I Weyl semimetal, exhibits
substantial Berry curvature but a small BCD around the Fermi level. In this
study, we employed first-principles methods to comprehensively investigate the
BCD in TaAs. Our findings reveal significant cancellation effects not only
within individual Weyl points but crucially, among distinct Weyl point pairs in
bulk TaAs. We propose a strategic approach to enhance the BCD in TaAs by
employing a layer-stacking technique. This greatly amplifies the BCD compared
to the bulk material. By tuning the number of slab layers, we can selectively
target specific Weyl point pairs near the Fermi level, while quantum
confinement effects suppress contributions from other pairs, mitigating

Graphene quantum dots provide promising platforms for hosting spin, valley,
or spin-valley qubits. Taking advantage of the electrically generated band gap
and the ambipolar nature, high-quality quantum dots can be defined in bilayer
graphene using natural p-n junctions as tunnel barriers. In these devices,
demonstrating the electrical tunability of the p-n junction barriers and
understanding its physical mechanism, especially in the few-electron regime,
are essential for further manipulating electron's quantum degrees of freedom to
encode qubits. Here, we show the electrostatic confinement of single quantum
dots in bilayer graphene using natural p-n junctions. When the device is
operated in the few-electron regime, the electron tunneling rate is found to be
monotonically tuned by varying gate voltages, which can be well understood from
the view of manipulating the p-n junction barriers. Our results provide an
insightful understanding of electrostatic confinement using natural p-n
junctions in bilayer graphene, which is beneficial for realizing graphene-based
qubits.

The demand for high-density storage is urgent in the current era of data
explosion. Recently, several single-molecule (-atom) magnets/ferroelectrics
have been reported to be promising candidates for high-density storage. As
another promising candidate, single-molecule multiferroics are not only small
but also possess ferroelectric and magnetic orderings, which can sometimes be
strongly coupled and used as data storages to realize the combination of
electric writing and magnetic reading. However, they have been rarely proposed,
and never been experimentally reported. Here, by building Hamiltonian models,
we propose a new model of single-molecule multiferroic in which electric
dipoles and magnetic moments are parallel and can rotate with the rotation of
the single molecule. Furthermore, with performing spin-lattice dynamics
simulations, we reveal the conditions (e.g., large enough single-ion anisotropy
and appropriate electric field) under which the new single-molecule
multiferroic can arise. Based on this model, as well as first-principles
calculations, a realistic example Co(NH3)4N@SWCNT is constructed and
numerically confirmed to demonstrate the feasibility of the new single-molecule
multiferroic model. Our work not only sheds light on the discovery of
single-molecule multiferroics but also provides a new guideline to design
multifunctional materials for ultimate memory devices.

Time reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors, resulting from external
magnetic fields or spontaneous magnetization, often leads to unconventional
superconducting properties. In this way, a conventional
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, characterized by the Cooper
pairs with nonzero total momentum, may be realized by the Zeeman effect caused
from external magnetic fields. Here, we report the observation of
superconductivity in a few-layer antiferromagnetic insulator CrOCl by utilizing
superconducting proximity effect with NbSe2 flakes. The superconductivity
demonstrates a considerably weak gap of about 0.12 meV and the in-plane upper
critical field reveals as behavior of the FFLO state at low temperature. Our
first-principles calculations indicate that the proximitized superconductivity
may exist in the CrOCl layer with Cr vacancies or line-defects. Moreover, the
FFLO state could be induced by the inherent larger spin splitting in the CrOCl
layer. Our findings not only demonstrate the fascinating interaction between
superconductivity and magnetism, but also provide a possible path to construct
FFLO state by intrinsic time reversal symmetry breaking and superconducting
proximity effect.

<h3>Predicting Ion Sequestration in Charged Polymers with the  Steepest-Entropy-Ascent Quantum Thermodynamic Framework</h3>

<br>
<i>Jared McDonald, Michael R. von Spakovsky, William T. Reynolds Jr</i>
<br>
<br>
The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic framework is used to
investigate the effectiveness of multi-chain
polyethyleneimine-methylenephosphonic acid in sequestering rare-earth ions
(Eu$^{+3}$) from aqueous solutions. The framework applies a thermodynamic
equation of motion to a discrete energy eigenstructure to model the binding
kinetics of europium ions to reactive sites of the polymer chains. The energy
eigenstructure is generated using a non-Markovian Monte Carlo model that
estimates energy level degeneracies. The equation of motion is used to
determine the occupation probability of each energy level, describing the
unique path through thermodynamic state space by which the polymer system
sequesters rare-earth ions from solution. A second Monte Carlo simulation is
conducted to relate the kinetic path in state space to physical descriptors
associated with the polymer, including the radius of gyration, tortuosity, and
Eu-neighbor distribution functions. These descriptors are used to visualize the
evolution of the polymer during the sequestration process. The fraction of
sequestered Eu$^{+3}$ ions depends upon the total energy of the system, with
lower energy resulting in higher sequestration. The kinetics of the overall
sequestration are dependent on the steepest-entropy-ascent principle used by
the equation of motion to generate a unique kinetic path from an initial
non-equilibrium state.

<h3>Topological transport of vorticity on curved magnetic membranes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00323</a>
<br>
<i>Chau Dao, Ji Zou, Eric Kleinherbers, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we study the transport of vorticity on curved dynamical
two-dimensional magnetic membranes. We find that topological transport can be
controlled by geometrically reducing symmetries, which enables processes that
are not present in flat magnetic systems. To this end, we construct a vorticity
3-current which obeys a continuity equation. This continuity equation is immune
to local fluctuations of the magnetic texture as well as spatiotemporal
fluctuations of the membrane. We show how electric current can manipulate
vortex transport in geometrically nontrivial magnetic systems. As an
illustrative example, we propose a minimal setup that realizes an
experimentally feasible energy storage device.

<br>
<br>
Locally noncentrosymmetric structures in crystals are attracting much
attention owing to emergent phenomena associated with the sublattice degree of
freedom. The newly discovered heavy fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is
considered to be an excellent realization of this class. Angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy experiments recently observed low-energy spectra of
electron and hole bands and characteristic Van Hove singularities, stimulating
us to explore the electronic correlation effect on the band structure. In this
Letter, we theoretically study the electronic state and topological
superconductivity from first principles. Owing to the Coulomb repulsion $U$ of
Ce 4$f$ electrons, the low-energy band structure is modified in accordance with
the experimental result. We show that Fermi surfaces change significantly from
a complicated three-dimensional structure to a simple two-dimensional one.
Fermi surface formulas for one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in class D
indicate topological crystalline superconductivity protected by the glide
symmetry in a broad region for $U$. The classification of superconducting gap
structure reveals topologically protected excitation gap and node. Our findings
of the correlation-induced evolution of electronic structure provide a basis to
clarify the unusual phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ including
superconductivity, magnetic order, and quadrupole density wave, and accelerate
the search for topological superconductivity in strongly correlated electron
systems.

<h3>Transport and electrical properties of cryogenic thermoelectric FeSb2:  the effect of isoelectronic and hole doping</h3>

Thermoelectric materials operating at cryogenic temperatures are in high
demand for efficient cooling and power generation in applications ranging from
superconductors to quantum computing. The narrow band-gap semiconductor FeSb2,
known for its colossal Seebeck coefficient, holds promise for such
applications, provided its thermal conductivity value can be reduced. This
study investigates the impact of isoelectronic substitution (Bi) and hole
doping (Pb) at the Sb site on the transport properties of FeSb2, with a
particular focus on thermal conductivity (\k{appa}). Polycrystalline FeSb2
powder, along with Bi- and Pb-doped samples, were synthesized using a simple
co-precipitation approach, followed by thermal treatment in an H2 atmosphere.
XRD and SEM analysis confirms the formation of the desired phase pre- and
post-consolidation using spark plasma sintering (SPS). The consolidation
process resulted in a high compaction density and the formation of
submicrometer-sized grains, as substantiated by electron backscattered
diffraction (EBSD) analysis. Substituting 1% of Bi and Pb at the Sb site
successfully suppressed the thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) from ~15 W/m-K in
pure FeSb2 to ~10 and ~8.7 W/m-K, respectively. Importantly, resistivity
measurements revealed a metal-to-insulator transition at around 6.5 K in
undoped FeSb2 and isoelectronically Bi-substituted FeSb2, suggesting the
existence of metallic surface states and provides valuable evidence for the
perplexing topological behavior exhibited by FeSb2.

<h3>The entropic origin of the enhancement of liquid diffusion at the  confining wall</h3>

<i>Lorenzo Agosta, Mikhail Dzugutov, Wim Briels, Kersti Hermansson</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a molecular dynamics simulation investigating the dynamics of a
simple liquid in the proximity to a non-interacting smooth confining wall. A
strong enhancement of the liquid diffusion is observed within the layers
adjacent to the wall. We present an analysis of these results in terms of the
scaling law earlier reported by one of us that relates the liquid diffusion
rate to the excess entropy. It is demonstrated that this scaling law can
successfully account for the observed diffusion enhancement in the liquid near
to the confining wall. We show that the proximity of a confining wall results
in the decrease of (the absolute value of) the local excess entropy in the
liquid layers closest to the wall which induces the observed diffusion
enhancement in these layers. These results thereby show that the application
scope of the scaling law which has so far only been used for the description of
the bulk liquid diffusion can be extended to the diffusion in liquids under
nano-scale confinement.

<h3>Two-dimensional double-kagome-lattice nitrogene: a direct band gap  semiconductor with nontrivial corner state</h3>

<br>
<i>Wenzhang Li, Qin He, Xiao-Ping Li, Da-Shuai Ma, Botao Fu</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on first-principles calculations, we predict that nitrogen atoms can
assemble into a single-layer double kagome lattice (DKL), which possesses the
characteristics of an intrinsic direct band gap semiconductor, boasting a
substantial band gap of 3.460 eV. The DKL structure results in a flat valence
band with high effective mass and a conduction band with small effective mass
comes from Dirac electrons. These distinctive band edges lead to a significant
disparity in carrier mobilities, with electron mobility being four orders of
magnitude higher than that of holes. The presence of flat band in DKL-nitrogene
can be further discerned through the enhanced optical absorption and correlated
effects as exemplified by hole-induced ferromagnetism. Interestingly,
DKL-nitrogene exhibits inherent second-order topological states, confirmed by a
non-trivial second Stiefel-Whitney number and the presence of 1D floating edge
states and 0D corner states within the bulk band gap. Additionally, the robust
N-N bonds and the lattice's bending structure ensure thermodynamic stability
and mechanical stiffness. These attributes make it exceptionally stable for
potential applications in nano-devices.

New methods for carbon dioxide removal are urgently needed to combat global
climate change. Direct air capture (DAC) is an emerging technology to capture
carbon dioxide directly from ambient air. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have
been widely studied as potentially customizable adsorbents for DAC. However,
discovering promising MOF sorbents for DAC is challenging because of the vast
chemical space to explore and the need to understand materials as functions of
humidity and temperature. We explore a computational approach benefiting from
recent innovations in machine learning (ML) and present a dataset named Open
DAC 2023 (ODAC23) consisting of more than 38M density functional theory (DFT)
calculations on more than 8,800 MOF materials containing adsorbed CO2 and/or
H2O. ODAC23 is by far the largest dataset of MOF adsorption calculations at the
DFT level of accuracy currently available. In addition to probing properties of
adsorbed molecules, the dataset is a rich source of information on structural
relaxation of MOFs, which will be useful in many contexts beyond specific
applications for DAC. A large number of MOFs with promising properties for DAC
are identified directly in ODAC23. We also trained state-of-the-art ML models
on this dataset to approximate calculations at the DFT level. This open-source
dataset and our initial ML models will provide an important baseline for future
efforts to identify MOFs for a wide range of applications, including DAC.

<h3>Theory of Orbital Pumping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00362" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00362</a>

<i>Seungyun Han, Hye-Won Ko, Jung Hyun Oh, Hyun-Woo Lee, Kyung-Jin Lee, Kyoung-Whan Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theory of orbital pumping, which corresponds to the emission of
orbital currents from orbital dynamics. This phenomenon exhibits two distinct
characteristics compared to spin pumping. Firstly, while spin pumping generates
solely spin (angular momentum) currents, orbital pumping yields both orbital
angular momentum currents and orbital angular position currents. Secondly,
lattice vibrations induce orbital dynamics and associated orbital pumping as
the orbital angular position is directly coupled to the lattice. These pumped
orbital currents can be detected as transverse electric voltages via the
inverse orbital(-torsion) Hall effect, stemming from orbital textures. Our work
proposes a new avenue for generating orbital currents and provides a broader
understanding of angular momentum dynamics encompassing spin, orbital, and
phonon.

<br>
<br>
Mapping the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution around ions in
electrolyte solution is crucial for the establishment of a microscopic
understanding of electrolyte solution properties. For solutions in the bulk
phase, it has not been possible to measure the ESP distribution on Angstrom
scale. Here we show that liquid electron scattering experiment using
state-of-the-art relativistic electron beam can be used to measure the Debye
screening length of aqueous LiCl, KCl, and KI solutions across a wide range of
concentrations. We observe that the Debye screening length is long-ranged at
low concentration and short-ranged at high concentration, providing key insight
into the decades-long debate over whether the impact of ions in water is
long-ranged or short-ranged. In addition, we show that the measured ESP can be
used to retrieve the non-local dielectric function of electrolyte solution,
which can serve as a promising route to investigate the electrostatic origin of
special ion effects. Our observations show that, interaction, as one of the two
fundamental perspectives for understanding electrolyte solution, can provide
much richer information than structure.

The aim of this short review is to summarize the developing theory aimed at
describing the effect of plastic events in amorphous solids on its emergent

<br>
<br>
Mechanical stress within biological tissue can indicate an anomaly, or can be
vital of its function, such as stresses in arteries. Measuring these stresses
in tissue is challenging due to the complex, and often unknown, nature of the
material properties. Recently, a method called the angled shear wave identity
was proposed to predict the stress by measuring the speed of two small
amplitude shear waves. The method does not require prior knowledge of the
material's constitutive law, making it ideal for complex biological tissues. We
extend this method, and the underlying identity, to include viscous
dissipation, which can be significant for biological tissues. To generalise the
identity, we consider soft viscoelastic solids described by a generalised
Newtonian viscous stress, and account for transverse isotropy, a feature that
is common in muscle tissue, for instance. We then derive the dispersion
relationship for small-amplitude shear waves superimposed on a large static
deformation. Similarly to the elastic case, the identity is recovered when the
stress in the material is coaxial with the transverse anisotropy. A key result
in this paper is that to predict the stress in a viscous materials one would
need to measure the wave attenuation as well as the wave speed.

<br>

It is known that a two dimensional dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model can
produce a nontrivial topological phase. It is a simple nearest-neighbor model
with either two or four lattice sites in in two dimensions.
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is easy to analyse but neglects important
interaction in physical systems. In this work, an extended version of this
model is proposed which includes all possible second nearest neighbor
interactions in order to make it more feasible to describe realistic systems.
The topological phases and properties of the model are characterized using a
polarization invariant. It is further shown that second nearest neighbor
interactions can be used to evoke a topological phase transition as well.

<i>Atmika Bhardwaj, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Marco Werner</i>
<br>
<br>
We use machine learning algorithms to detect the crystalline phase in
undercooled melts in molecular dynamics simulations. Our classification method
is based on local conformation and environmental fingerprints of individual
monomers. In particular, we employ self-supervised auto-encoders to compress
the fingerprint information and a Gaussian mixture model to distinguish ordered
states from disordered ones. The resulting identification of crystalline
monomers agrees to a large extent with human-defined classifiers such as the
stem-length-based classification scheme as developed in our previous work [C.
Luo and J.-U. Sommer, Macromolecules 44 (2011), 1523], but does not require any
foreknowledge about the structure of semi-crystalline polymers. Because of its
local sensitivity, the method allows the resolution of detailed time patterns
of crystalline order before an apparent signature of the transition is visible
in thermodynamic properties such as for the specific volume. At a
pre-transition point, we observe the highest crystallization efficiency using
the fraction of monomers being conserved in the crystalline phase as compared
to the number of monomers joining that phase.

<br>
<br>
For more than a century lattice random walks have been employed ubiquitously,
both as a theoretical laboratory to develop intuition of more complex
stochastic processes and as a tool to interpret a vast array of empirical
observations. Recent advances in lattice random walk theory in bounded and
heterogeneous environments have opened up opportunities to cope with the finely
resolved spatio-temporal nature of modern movement data. We review such
advances and their formalisms to represent analytically the walker
spatio-temporal dynamics in arbitrary dimensions and geometries. As new
findings, we derive the exact spatio-temporal representation of biased walks in
a periodic hexagon, we use the discrete Feynman-Kac equation to describe a
walker's interaction with a radiation boundary, and we unearth a disorder
indifference phenomenon. To demonstrate the power of the formalism we uncover
the appearance of multiple first-passage peaks with biased walkers in a
periodic hexagon, we display the dependence of the first-transmission
probability on the proximity transfer efficiency between two resetting walkers
in a one-dimensional periodic lattice, we present an example of spatial
disorder in a two-dimensional square lattice that strongly affects the
splitting probabilities to either of two targets, and we study the
first-reaction dynamics in an unbounded one-dimensional lattice.

<h3>Universal symmetry of optimal control at the microscale</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Optimal control is an important field in thermodynamics, mathematics and
engineering which searches for strategies e.g. to move an object to a target
position within a given time with minimal energetic effort. Especially for
micro- and nanomachines, for which power supply is often limited, knowledge of
optimal control protocols is crucial for their operation under realistic
conditions. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically the optimal
protocol for transporting a microscopic colloidal particle with an optical trap
in such a way that the required work is minimal. The experiments were conducted
in viscous and viscoelastic media, which represent typical environments for
synthetic and biological nanomachines. Despite marked differences between the
protocols in both fluids, we find that the optimal transport protocol and the
corresponding average particle trajectory always obeys time-reversal symmetry.
This symmetry, which surprisingly appears here for a class of processes far
away from thermal equilibrium, is moreover expected to hold universally for
e.g. active, granular and long-range correlated media in their linear regimes.
The uncovered symmetry provides a rigorous and versatile criterion for optimal
control which greatly facilitates the search of energy-efficient transport
strategies in a wide range of systems.

<br>
Due to the complex interactions between rare-earth elements and transition
metals, as well as between themselves, rare-earth transition-metal oxides are
likely to exhibit highly intriguing and novel magnetic structures and dynamic
behaviours. Rare-earth elements in these compounds frequently demonstrate
unusual behaviours in their crystal-field (CF) excitations, which necessitate
thorough studies for in-depth comprehensions. When cooling from 10 K to 1.5 K
through the magnetic ordering temperature of $Er^{3+}$ at 4.1 K, we observed a
significant energy shift of the low-lying CF excitation of $Er^{3+}$ in erbium
orthoferrite ($ErFeO_3$) from 0.32 meV to 0.75 meV utilizing the inelastic
neutron-scattering technique. A sound CF model was proposed for $Er^{3+}$ in
$ErFeO_3$ by fitting to the observed CF excitation peaks, which enables to
explain all the observed experimental results in a very consistent manner.
According to the model, the ground crystal field level of $Er^{3+}$, which
corresponds to the lowest Kramers doublet supposed to be at zero energy
transfer, has been shifted by the internal magnetic fields induced by both
$Er^{3+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$ spin orders below and above the $Er^{3+}$ ordering
temperature, respectively. Additional measurements in various magnetic fields
offer compelling evidence in favour of this hypothesis. The measured external
field dependence of the CF excitation energy led to a derivation of the
internal field of $Er^{3+}$ as 0.54 T, which is strongly corroborated by
theoretical modelling. Additionally, the g-factor for the $Er^{3+}$ ground
state in $ErFeO_3$ shows an exceptionally significant anisotropy.

<br>
<br>
We provide a comprehensive theoretical study of the radio-frequency (rf)
spectra of a two-component Fermi gas with balanced populations in the normal
region of the temperature-vs-coupling phase diagram. In particular, rf spectra
are analyzed in terms of two characteristic peaks, which can be either distinct
or overlapping. On the BEC side of the crossover, these two contributions are
associated with a fermionic quasi-particle peak and a bosonic-like contribution
due to pairing. On the BCS side of the crossover, the two peaks are instead
associated with interactions between particles occurring, respectively, at high
or low relative momenta. Through this two-peak analysis, we show how and to
what extent the correlation between the widths of the rf spectra and the pair
size, previously identified in the superfluid phase at low temperature, can be
extended to the normal phase, as well as how the temperature-vs-coupling phase
diagram of the BCS-BEC crossover can be partitioned in a number of distinct
physical sectors. Several analytic results for the shape and widths of the rf
spectra are also derived in appropriate temperature and coupling limits.

Europium intermetallic compounds show a variety of different ground states
and anomalous physical properties due to the interactions between the localized
4f electrons and the delocalized electronic states. Europium is also the most
reactive of the rare earth metals which might be the reason why very few works
are concerned with the properties of Eu-based thin films. Here we address the
low-temperature magnetic properties of ferromagnetic EuPd$_2$ thin films
prepared by molecular beam epitaxy. The epitaxial (111)-oriented thin films
grow on MgO (100) with eight different domain orientations. We analyze the
low-temperature magnetic hysteresis behavior by means of micromagnetic
simulations taking the multi-domain morphology explicitly into account and
quantify the magnetic crystal anisotropy contribution. By ab initio
calculations we trace back the microscopic origin of the magnetic anisotropy to
thin film-induced biaxial strain.

Gaining insight into the characteristics of epitaxial complex oxide films is
essential to control the behavior of devices and catalytic processes. It is
known that substrate induced strain, doping, and layer growth can affect the
electronic and magnetic properties of the film's bulk. In this study, we
demonstrate a clear distinction between the bulk and surface of thin films of
La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 in terms of chemical composition, electronic disorder, and
surface morphology. We employed a combined experimental approach of X-ray based
characterization methods and scanning probe microscopy. X-ray diffraction and
resonant X-ray reflectivity revealed surface non-stochiometry in the strontium
and lanthanum, as well as an accumulation of oxygen vacancies. Scanning
tunneling microscopy showed a staggered growth surface morphology accompanied
by an electronic phase separation (EPS) related to this non-stochiometry. The
EPS is likely responsible for the temperature-dependent resistivity transition
and is a cause of a proposed mixed-phase ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state
near room temperature in these thin films.

Standard deep learning algorithms require differentiating large nonlinear
networks, a process that is slow and power-hungry. Electronic learning
metamaterials offer potentially fast, efficient, and fault-tolerant hardware
for analog machine learning, but existing implementations are linear, severely
limiting their capabilities. These systems differ significantly from artificial
neural networks as well as the brain, so the feasibility and utility of
incorporating nonlinear elements have not been explored. Here we introduce a
nonlinear learning metamaterial -- an analog electronic network made of
self-adjusting nonlinear resistive elements based on transistors. We
demonstrate that the system learns tasks unachievable in linear systems,
including XOR and nonlinear regression, without a computer. We find our
nonlinear learning metamaterial reduces modes of training error in order (mean,
slope, curvature), similar to spectral bias in artificial neural networks. The
circuitry is robust to damage, retrainable in seconds, and performs learned
tasks in microseconds while dissipating only picojoules of energy across each
transistor. This suggests enormous potential for fast, low-power computing in
edge systems like sensors, robotic controllers, and medical devices, as well as
manufacturability at scale for performing and studying emergent learning.

<h3>Relationship between event counting statistics and waiting time  statistics in the steady state</h3>

There are two main quantities involved in the deviation of a stochastic
process from a Poisson process: the squared coefficient of variation of the
time intervals between adjacent events and the Fano factor of the number of
reaction events. As well known, these two quantities are equal for renewal
processes, while their relationship remains unexplored for non-renewal
processes. In this paper, we establish an explicit relation between the two
statistics that is applicable to non-renewal processes. The new relation, which
reduces to the previously mentioned result for renewal processes, is confirmed
to be accurate in several cases of non-renewal processes.

<h3>Critical current throughout the BCS-BEC crossover with the inclusion of  pairing fluctuations</h3>

<br>
<br>
The present work aims at providing a systematic analysis of the current
density versus momentum characteristics for a fermionic superfluid throughout
the BCS-BEC crossover, even in the fully homogeneous case. At low temperatures,
where pairing fluctuations are not strong enough to invalidate a quasi-particle
approach, a sharp threshold for the inception of a back-flow current is found,
which sets the onset of dissipation and identifies the critical momentum
according to Landau. This momentum is seen to smoothly evolve from the BCS to
the BEC regimes, whereby a single expression for the single-particle current
density that includes pairing fluctuations enables us to incorporate on equal
footing two quite distinct dissipative mechanisms, namely, pair-breaking and
phonon excitations in the two sides of the BCS-BEC crossover, respectively. At
finite temperature, where thermal fluctuations broaden the excitation spectrum
and make the dissipative (kinetic and thermal) mechanisms intertwined with each
other, an alternative criterion due to Bardeen is instead employed to signal
the loss of superfluid behavior. In this way, detailed comparison with
available experimental data in linear and annular geometries is significantly
improved with respect to previous approaches, thereby demonstrating the crucial
role played by quantum fluctuations in renormalizing the single-particle
excitation spectrum.

Defects in wide bandgap semiconductors have recently emerged as promising
candidates for solid-state quantum optical technologies. Electrical excitation
of emitters may pave the way to scalable on-chip devices, and therefore is
highly sought after. However, most wide band gap materials are not amenable to
efficient doping, which in turn poses challenges on efficient electrical
excitation and on-chip integration. Here, we demonstrate for the first time
room temperature electroluminescence from isolated colour centres in hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN). We harness the van der Waals (vdW) structure of
two-dimensional materials, and engineer nanoscale devices comprised of graphene
- hBN - graphene tunnel junctions. Under an applied bias, charge carriers are
injected into hBN, and result in a localised light emission from the hBN colour
centres. Remarkably, our devices operate at room temperature and produce
robust, narrowband emission spanning a wide spectral range - from the visible
to the near infrared. Our work marks an important milestone in van der Waals
materials and their promising attributes for integrated quantum technologies
and on-chip photonic circuits.

We present an efficient cooling scheme for fermionic $^{40}{\text{K}}$ atoms,
using laser light red and blue detuned with respect to the $\mathcal{D}2$ and
$\mathcal{D}1$ principle flourescence lines, respectively. The cooling scheme
is found to significantly increase the saturation level for loading of a
$^{40}{\text{K}}$ magneto-optical trap (MOT), resulting in increased atom
numbers or decreased cycle times. While the attainable $^{40}{\text{K}}$ atom
number is approximately doubled if exclusively $^{40}{\text{K}}$ atoms are
cooled, the scheme is particularly powerful for dual-species MOTs, for example,
if $^{40}{\text{K}}$ and $^{87}{\text{Rb}}$ atoms are cooled simultaneously in
the same MOT configuration. The typical atom losses due to light-assisted
hetero-nuclear collisions between $^{40}{\text{K}}$ and $^{87}{\text{Rb}}$ seem
to be reduced giving rise to a threefold improvement of the $^{40}{\text{K}}$
atom number as compared to that in a conventional dual-species MOT, operating
merely with $\mathcal{D}2$ light. Our scheme can be a useful extension to most
dual-species experiments, aiming to reach simultaneous degeneracy of both
species.

<h3>Electric Fields Near Undulating Dielectric Membranes</h3>

Dielectric interfaces are crucial to the behavior of charged membranes, from
graphene to synthetic and biological lipid bilayers. Understanding electrolyte
behavior near these interfaces remains a challenge, especially in the case of
rough dielectric surfaces. A lack of analytical solutions consigns this problem
to numerical treatments. We report an analytic method for determining
electrostatic potentials near curved dielectric membranes in a two-dimensional
periodic 'slab' geometry using a periodic summation of Green's functions. This
method is amenable to simulating arbitrary groups of charges near surfaces with
two-dimensional deformations. We concentrate on one-dimensional undulations. We
show that increasing membrane undulation increases the asymmetry of interfacial
charge distributions due to preferential ionic repulsion from troughs. In the
limit of thick membranes we recover results mimicking those for electrolytes
near a single interface. Our work demonstrates that rough surfaces generate
charge patterns in electrolytes of charged molecules or mixed-valence ions.

<h3>An alternative spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern for $\rm{U}(1)$  with no gapless Goldstone mode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00574" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00574</a>
<br>
<i>Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Yan-Wei Dai</i>
<br>
<br>
An emergent gapless Goldstone mode originates from continuous spontaneous
symmetry breaking, which has become a doctrine since the pioneering work by
Goldstone [J. Goldstone, Nuovo Cimento \textbf{19}, 154 (1961)]. However, we
argue that it is possible for a continuous symmetry group $\rm{U}(1)$ to make
an exceptional case, simply due to the well-known mathematical result that a
continuous symmetry group $\rm{U}(1)$ may be regarded as a limit of a discrete
symmetry group $Z_q$ when $q$ tends to infinity. As a consequence, spontaneous
symmetry breaking for such a continuous symmetry group $\rm{U}(1)$ does not
necessarily lead to any gapless Goldstone mode. This is explicitly explained
for an anisotropic extension of the ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model. In
a sense, this model provides an illustrative example regarding the dichotomy
between continuity and discreteness.

We investigate the periodic Anderson model of the bulk samarium hexaboride in
the slave-boson framework assuming the presence of ferromagnetic impurities.
Our analysis provides a strong evidence that the system is in the quantum
anomalous Hall phase when the exchange interaction is not zero. Thereafter, we
show that the bulk samarium hexaboride is a strong topological insulator
calculating Z2 invariant using the Fu-Kane-Mele formalism.

<h3>Large deviations and conditioning for chaotic non-invertible  deterministic maps: analysis via the forward deterministic dynamics and the  backward stochastic dynamics</h3>

The large deviations properties of trajectory observables for chaotic
non-invertible deterministic maps as studied recently by N. R. Smith, Phys.
Rev. E 106, L042202 (2022) and by R. Gutierrez, A. Canella-Ortiz, C.
Perez-Espigares, arXiv:2304.13754 are revisited in order to analyze in detail
the similarities and the differences with the case of stochastic Markov chains.
To be concrete, we focus on the simplest example displaying the two essential
properties of local-stretching and global-folding, namely the doubling map $
x_{t+1} = 2 x_t [\text{mod} 1] $ on the real-space interval $x \in [0,1[$ that
can be also analyzed via the decomposition $x= \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty}
\frac{\sigma_l}{2^l} $ into binary coefficients $\sigma_l=0,1$. The large
deviations properties of trajectory observables can be studied either via
deformations of the forward deterministic dynamics or via deformations of the
backward stochastic dynamics. Our main conclusions concerning the construction
of the corresponding Doob canonical conditioned processes are: (i) non-trivial
conditioned dynamics can be constructed only in the backward stochastic
perspective where the reweighting of existing transitions is possible, and not
in the forward deterministic perspective ; (ii) the corresponding conditioned
steady state is not smooth on the real-space interval $x \in [0,1[$ and can be
better characterized in the binary space $\sigma_{l=1,2,..,+\infty}$. As a
consequence, the backward stochastic dynamics in the binary space is also the
most appropriate framework to write the explicit large deviations at level 2
for the probability of the empirical density of long backward trajectories.

<h3>Hysteresis and chaos in anomalous Josephson junctions without  capacitance</h3>

<br>
<br>
Usually, overdamped Josephson junctions do not exhibit chaotic behaviour in
their phase dynamics, either because the phase space dimension is less than
three (as in the case of a single overdamped ac-driven junction) or due to the
general tendency of systems to become less chaotic with increasing dissipation
(as in the case of coupled overdamped junctions). Here we consider the
so-called $\varphi_0$ S/F/S Josephson junction in which the current flowing
through the junction may induce magnetization dynamics in the ferromagnetic
interlayer, between the two superconducting layers. We find that, due to the
induced magnetization dynamics, even in the overdamped limit, i.e. for a
junction without capacitance, the junction may exhibit chaos and hysteresis
that in some cases leads to multiple branches in its current-voltage
characteristics. We also show that pulsed current signals can result in
switching between different voltage states, a result which is potentially
useful for superconducting memory applications.

Inherent properties of superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x films, such as the
high superconducting transition temperature Tc, efficient Josephson coupling
between neighboring CuO layers, and fast quasiparticle relaxation dynamics,
make them a promising platform for advances in quantum computing and
communication technologies. However, preserving two-dimensional
superconductivity during device fabrication is an outstanding experimental
challenge because of the fast degradation of the superconducting properties of
two-dimensional flakes when they are exposed to moisture, organic sol vents,
and heat. Here, to realize superconducting devices utilizing two-dimensional
superconducting films, we develop a novel fabrication technique relying on the
cryogenic dry transfer of printable circuits embedded into a silicon nitride
membrane. This approach separates the circuit fabrication stage requiring
chemically reactive substances and ionizing physical processes from the
creation of the thin superconducting structures. Apart from providing
electrical contacts in a single transfer step, the membrane encapsulates the
surface of the crystal shielding it from the environment. The fabricated
atomically thin Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x-based devices show high superconducting
transition temperature Tc ~ 91 K close to that of the bulk crystal and
demonstrate stable super conducting properties

efficient and mobile cooling tool for applications at 4 K and below.

This Manuscript aims to compare the so-called iterated perturbation theory

insulating system driven out of equilibrium by a static electric field.
Electronic heat bath and optical phonons are employed as dissipation mechanism
of the current-induced Joule heat that the excited electrons of the lattice
experience as the result of the field's driving. Despite its semplicity, the
IPT approach yields results which are in good agreement with those obtained

Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ is an orthorhombic non-symmorphic small band gap
semiconductor with three distinct Eu$^{2+}$ sites and two low-temperature
magnetic phase transitions. The material displays one of the greatest
(negative) magnetoresistances of known stoichiometric antiferromagnets and
belongs to a family of Zintl materials that may host an axion insulator. Using
single crystal neutron diffraction, we show that the
$T_{\mathrm{N1}}=14\mathrm{~K}$ second-order phase transition is associated
with long-range antiferromagnetic order within the chemical unit cell $\left(
k_1 = (000) \right)$. Upon cooling below $T_{\mathrm{N1}}$, the relative
sublattice magnetizations of this structure vary until a second-order phase
transition at $T_{\mathrm{N2}}=7\mathrm{~K}$ that doubles the unit cell along
the $\hat{c}$ axis $\left( k_2 = \left(00\frac{1}{2}\right) \right)$. We show
the anisotropic susceptibility and our magnetic neutron diffraction data are
consistent with magnetic structures described by the $\Gamma_3$ irreducible
representation with the staggered magnetization of the $k_1$ and $k_2$
components polarized along the $\hat{b}$ and $\hat{a}$ axis, respectively. As
the $k_2$ component develops, the amplitude of the $k_1$ component is reduced,
which indicates a 2k non-collinear magnetic structure. Density functional
theory is used to calculate the energies of these magnetic structures and to
show the $k_1$ phase is a metal so $T_{\mathrm{N1}}$ is a rare example of a
unit-cell-preserving second-order phase transition from a paramagnetic
semiconductor to an antiferromagnetic metal. DFT indicates the transition at
$T_{\mathrm{N2}}$ to a doubled unit cell reduces the carrier density of the
metal, which is consistent with resistivity data.

In this work we present a simulation of the semiconductor electrodes of
photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cells based on the nonequilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) formalism. While the performance of simple PEC cells
can be adequately explained with semi-classical drift-diffusion theory, the
increasing interest towards thin film cells and nanostructures in general
requires theoretical treatment that can capture the quantum phenomena
influencing the charge carrier dynamics in these devices. Specifically, we
study a p-type Cu2O electrode and examine the influence of the bias voltage,
reaction kinetics and the thickness of the Cu2O layer on the generated
photocurrent. The NEGF equations are solved in a self-consistent manner with
the electrostatic potential from Poisson's equation, sunlight induced photon
scattering and the chemical overpotential required to drive the water splitting
reaction. We show that the NEGF simulation accurately reproduces experimental
results from both voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy measurements, while
providing an energy resolved solution of the charge carrier densities and
corresponding currents inside the semiconductor electrode at nanoscale.

We propose an efficient ab initio framework to compute the Gibbs energy of

thermal excitations at density-functional-theory level. With the aid of a
bespoke machine-learning interatomic potential, the temperature-dependent
vacancy formation and migration Gibbs energies of the prototype system bcc
tungsten are shown to be strongly affected by anharmonicity. This explains the
physical origin of the experimentally observed non-Arrhenius behavior of W
self-diffusion as a case study. The good agreement of the self-diffusivity with
experiment demonstrates that accurate ab initio diffusion databases are in
reach.

CuGaS2 films grown by physical vapour deposition have been studied by
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, using excitation intensity and temperature
dependent analyses. We observe free and bound exciton recombinations, three
donor-to-acceptor (DA) transitions, and deep-level transitions. The DA
transitions at ~ 2.41 eV, 2.398 eV and ~ 2.29 eV are attributed to a common
donor level ~ 38+-5 meV and three shallow acceptors at ~ 76 meV, ~ 90 meV and
210 meV above the valence band. This electronic structure is very similar to
other chalcopyrite materials. The donor-acceptor transitions are accompanied by
phonon replicas. Cu-rich and near-stoichiometric material is dominated by the
transitions due to the acceptor at 210 meV. All films show deep-level
transitions at ~ 2.15 eV and 1.85 eV due to broad deep defect bands. Slightly
Cu-deficient films are dominated by intense transitions at ~ 2.45 eV,
attributed to excitonic transitions and the broad defect transition at 2.15 eV.

<br>
The ground-state phase diagram is mapped out for an alternative anisotropic
extension of quantum spin-1 ferromagnetic biquadratic model, which accommodates
twelve distinct phases: three degenerate fractal phases, six Luttinger liquid
phases and three symmetry-protected trivial phases. It is found that distinct
types of quantum phase transitions are involved between them. In particular,
one type arises from an instability of a Luttinger liquid towards a degenerate
fractal phase, and the other type describes spontaneous symmetry breaking with
type-B Goldstone modes from one degenerate fractal phase to another degenerate
fractal phase, with the fractal dimension $d_f$ being identical to the number
of the type-B Goldstone modes, both of which turn out to be one. In addition,
quantum phase transitions from the Luttinger liquid phases to the
symmetry-protected trivial phases are identified to be in the
Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, with central charge being one.

We report on the temperature dependence of birefringence and of the static
dielectric permittivity tensor in a series of binary mixtures between the
symmetric, bent-shaped, 1",9"-bis(4-cyanobiphenyl-4'-yl) nonane (CB9CB) dimer
and the monomeric nematogen 5CB. In the studied composition range the mixtures
exhibit two nematic phases with distinct birefringence and dielectric features.
Birefringence measurements are used to estimate the temperature dependence of
the tilt between the axis defining the nanoscale helical modulation of the low
temperature nematic phase with the (local) direction of the maximal alignment
of the cyanobiphenyl units. Planar as well as magnetically and/or electrically
aligned samples are used to measure the perpendicular and parallel components
of the dielectric permittivity in both nematic phases. A self-consistent
molecular field theory that takes into account flexibility and symmetry of the
constituent mesogens is introduced for the calculation of order parameters and
intra-molecular orientational dipolar correlations of the flexible dimers as a
function of temperature/concentration. Utilising the tilt angle, as calculated
from the birefringence measurements, and the predictions of the molecular
theory, dielectric permittivity is modelled in the framework of the anisotropic
version of the Kirkwood-Frohlich theory. Using the inter-molecular Kirkwood
correlation factors as adjustable parameters, excellent agreement between
theory and permittivity measurements across the whole temperature range and
composition of the mixtures is obtained. The importance of the orientational,
intra- and inter-molecular, dipolar correlations, their relative impact on the
static dielectric properties, as well as their connection with the local
structure of the nematic phases of bent-shaped bimesogens, is discussed.

We report on the first example of epitaxial Mn$_{3 + \delta}$Ge thin films
with a cubic $L1_2$ structure. The films are found to exhibit frustrated
ferromagnetism with an average magnetization corresponding to
0.98$~\pm~$0.06$~\mu_B$/Mn, far larger than the parasitic ferromagnetism in
hexagonal Mn$_3$Ge and the partially compensated ferrimagnetism in tetragonal
Mn$_3$Ge. The Hall conductivity is the largest reported for the kagome magnets
with a low temperature value of $\sigma_{xy} = 1587~$S/cm. Density functional
calculations predict that a chiral antiferromagnetic structure is lower in
energy than a ferromagnetic configuration in an ordered stoichiometric crystal.
However, chemical disorder driven by the excess Mn in our films explains why a
frustrated 120$^\circ$ spin structure is not observed. Comparisons between the
magnetization and the Hall resistivity indicate that a non-coplanar spin
structure contributes the Hall signal. Anisotropic magnetoresistance and planar
Hall effect with hysteresis up to 14 T provides further insights into this
material.

Active colloidal systems have emerged as promising contenders for the future

unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) undergo spontaneous phase separation at room
temperature leading to Janus-like GUVs with two distinct lipid phases. We
report self-propulsion of the Janus GUVs via induced charge electroosmosis, in
between parallel electrodes. Remarkably, the fluid nature of the lipid membrane
affected by the electric field leads to asymmetry-symmetry transient states
resulting in run-and-tumble events supported by structure domain analysis. We
characterise an enhanced rotational diffusivity associated with tumble events,
decoupled from thermal reorientation. Lastly, we identify cargo-release
capabilities and a variety of shape-encoded dynamic modes in these vesicles.
This cell-inspired architecture provides an alternative route for creating
motile artificial cells and programmable microswimmers.

Lattice defects have interesting effects in some quantum Hamiltonians. Here
we show how topological crystalline defects can produce qualitatively new
effects by coupling to electric field probes such as Raman scattering, even
when they do not appear in the low-energy Hamiltonian but rather only in the
probe response theory. To show this we consider an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2
model $H_{spin}$ on a zigzag chain. Crystalline domain walls between two zigzag
domains appear as at most local defects in $H_{spin}$, but as topological (not
locally creatable) defects in the Raman operator $R$ of inelastic photon
scattering. Using TEBD numerics, bosonization, and mean field, we show that a
finite density of crystalline domain walls shifts the entire Raman signal to
produce an effective gap. This lattice-defect-induced Raman gap closes and
reopens in applied magnetic fields. We discuss the effect in terms of photons
sensing the lattice defects within $R$ as spin-dimerization domain walls, with
$Z_2$ character, and a resulting shift of the probed wavevector from $q=0$ to
$\pi+\delta q$, giving an $\textit{O}(1)$ change in contrast to local defects.
The magneto-Raman singularity from topological lattice defects here relies on
the $H_{spin}$ spinon liquid state, suggesting future applications using
lattice topological defects to modify response-theory operators independently
of $H$ and thereby generate new probes of quantum phases.

In magnetic tunnel junctions based on iron oxide nanoparticles the disorder
and the oxidation state of the surface spin as well as the nanoparticles
functionalization play a crucial role in the magnetotransport properties. In
this work, we report a systematic study of the effects of vacuum annealing on
the structural, magnetic and transport properties of self-assembled ~10 nm
Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The high temperature treatment (from 573 to 873 K)
decomposes the organic coating into amorphous carbon, reducing the electrical
resistivity of the assemblies by 4 orders of magnitude. At the same time, the
3Fe2+/(Fe3++Fe2+) ratio is reduced from 1.11 to 0.13 when the annealing
temperature of the sample increases from 573 to 873 K, indicating an important
surface oxidation. Although the 2 nm physical gap remains unchanged with the
thermal treatment, a monotonous decrease of tunnel barrier width was obtained
from the electron transport measurements when the annealing temperature
increases, indicating an increment in the number of defects and hot-spots in
the gap between the nanoparticles. This is reflected in the reduction of the
spin dependent tunneling, which reduces the interparticle magnetoresistance.
This work shows new insights about influence of the nanoparticle interfacial
composition, as well their the spatial arrangement, on the tunnel transport of
self-assemblies, and evidence the importance of optimizing the nanostructure
fabrication for increasing the tunneling current without degrading the spin
polarized current.
