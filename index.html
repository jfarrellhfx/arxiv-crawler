<h3>Direct-Writing Atom-by-Atom</h3>

Direct-write processes enable the alteration or deposition of materials in a
continuous, directable, sequential fashion. In this work we demonstrate an
electron beam direct-write process in an aberration-corrected scanning
transmission electron microscope. This process has several fundamental
differences from conventional electron beam induced deposition techniques,
where the electron beam dissociates precursor gases into chemically reactive
products that bond to a substrate. Here, we use elemental tin (Sn) as a
precursor and employ a different mechanism to facilitate deposition. The
atomic-sized electron beam is used to generate chemically reactive point
defects at desired locations in a graphene substrate. Temperature control of
the sample is used to enable the precursor atoms to migrate across the surface
and bond to the defect sites thereby enabling atom-by-atom direct-writing.

<h3>Inertial effects on rectification and diffusion of active Brownian  particles in an asymmetric channel</h3>

Micro- and nano-swimmers moving in a fluid solvent confined by structures
that produce entropic barriers are often described by overdamped active
Brownian particle dynamics, where viscous effects are large and inertia plays
no role. However, inertial effects should be considered for confined swimmers
moving in media where viscous effects are no longer dominant. Here, we study
how inertia affects the rectification and diffusion of self-propelled particles
in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel. We show that most of the particles
accumulate at the channel walls as the masses of the particles increase.
Furthermore, the average particle velocity has a maximum as a function of the
mass, indicating that particles with an optimal mass $M^{*}_{\rm op}$ can be
sorted from a mixture with particles of other masses. In particular, we find
that the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits an enhanced diffusion peak as
a function of the mass, which is a signature of the accumulation of most of the
particles at the channel walls. The dependence of $M^{*}_{\rm op}$ on the
rotational diffusion rate, self-propulsion force, aspect ratio of the channel,
and active torque is also determined. The results of this study could stimulate
the development of strategies for controlling the diffusion of self-propelled
particles in entropic ratchet systems.

Orbital degrees of freedom mediating an interaction between spin and lattice
were predicted to raise strong magnetoelectric effect, i.e. realize an
efficient coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric orders. However, the
effect of orbital fluctuations have been considered only in a few
magnetoelectric materials, as orbital degeneracy driven Jahn-Teller effect
rarely couples to polarization. Here, we explore the spin-lattice coupling in
multiferroic Swedenborgites with mixed valence and Jahn-Teller active
transition metal ions on a stacked triangular/Kagome lattice using infrared and
dielectric spectroscopy. On one hand, in CaBa$M_4$O$_7$ ($M$ = Co, Fe), we
observe strong magnetic order induced shift in the phonon frequencies and a
corresponding large change in the dielectric response. Remarkably, as an
unusual manifestation of the spin-phonon coupling, the spin-fluctuations reduce
the phonon life-time by an order of magnitude at the magnetic phase
transitions. On the other hand, lattice vibrations, dielectric response, and
electric polarization show no variation at the N\'eel temperature of
CaBaFe$_2$Co$_2$O$_7$, which is built up by orbital singlet ions. Our results
provide a showcase for orbital degrees of freedom enhanced magnetoelectric
coupling via the example of Swedenborgites.

<h3>Charge transfer mediated giant photo-amplification in air-stable  $α$-CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals decorated 2D-WS$_2$ photo-FET with asymmetric  contacts</h3>

Hybrid heterostructure based phototransistors are attractive owing to their
high gain induced by photogating effect. However, the absence of an in-plane
built-in electric field in the single channel layer transistor results in a
relatively higher dark current and require a large operating gate voltage of
the device. Here, we report novel air-stable cesium lead iodide/tungsten
di-sulfide (CsPbI$_3$/WS$_2$) mixed dimensional heterostructure based
photo-field-effect-transistors (photo-FETs) with asymmetric metal electrodes
(Cr/WS$_2$/Au), exhibiting extremely low dark current (~10-12 A) with a
responsivity of ~102 A/W at zero gate bias. The Schottky barrier (WS$_2$/Au
interface) induced rectification characteristics in the channel accompanied by
the excellent photogating effect from solution-processed $\alpha$-phase
CsPbI$_3$ NCs sensitizers, resulting in gate-tunable broadband photodetection
with a very high responsivity (~104 A/W) and excellent sensitivity (~106). Most
interestingly, the device shows superior performance even under high humidity
(50-65%) conditions owing to the formation of cubic $\alpha$-phase CsPbI$_3$
nanocrystals with a relatively smaller lattice constant (a = 6.2315 {\AA}) and
filling of surface vacancies (Pb2+ centres) with the sulfur atoms from WS$_2$
layer, thus protecting it from environmental degradation. These results
emphasise a novel strategy for developing mixed dimensional hybrid
heterostructure based phototransistors for futuristic integrated
nano-optoelectronic systems.

<br>
<br>
We present a new method to synthesize bulk GaN and InN polycrystals by means
of a solid-state chemical reaction in High Pressure/High Temperature
conditions. The reaction involves the binary oxides ($Ga_2O_3$ and $In_2O_3$)
and the highly reactive $Li_3N$ as nitrogen source. The formation of the
expected hexagonal phase of GaN and InN, occurring at 900 {\deg}C and 350
{\deg}C respectively and P $\geq$ 2.5 GPa, was successfully confirmed by powder
X-ray diffraction, with the presence of spurious Li-based binary and ternary
(containing also the III group cation) impurities. A simple washing processes
in aqueous solution followed by centrifugation allowed to obtain pure GaN and
InN polycrystalline powders as precipitates. These results point out a simple,
low cost and scalable way to produce significant quantities of two of the most
promising nitrides in the field of electronics and energy technologies.

Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have emerged as an excellent class of
semiconductors for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.
Tailoring physical properties by fine-tuning the lattice structures has been
explored in these materials by chemical composition or morphology.
Nevertheless, its dynamic counterpart, phonon-driven ultrafast material
control, as contemporarily harnessed for oxide perovskites, has not been
established yet. Here we employ intense THz electric fields to obtain direct
lattice control via nonlinear excitation of coherent octahedral twist modes in
hybrid CH3NH3PbBr3 and all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites. These Raman-active
phonons at 0.9 - 1.3 THz are found to govern the ultrafast THz-induced Kerr
effect in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase and thus dominate the
phonon-modulated polarizability with potential implications for dynamic charge
carrier screening beyond the Froehlich polaron. Our work opens the door to
selective control of LHP's vibrational degrees of freedom governing phase
transitions and dynamic disorder.

Understanding and modeling plasma-surface interactions frame a multi-scale as
well as multi-physics problem. Scale-bridging machine learning surface
surrogate models have been demonstrated to perceive the fundamental atomic
fidelity for the physical vapor deposition of pure metals. However, the immense
computational cost of the data-generating simulations render a practical
application with predictions on relevant timescales impracticable. This issue
is resolved in this work for the sputter deposition of AlN in Ar/N$_2$
discharges by developing a scheme that populates the parameter spaces
effectively. Hybrid reactive molecular dynamics / time-stamped force-bias Monte
Carlo simulations of randomized plasma-surface interactions / diffusion
processes are used to setup a physics-separating artificial neural network. The
application of this generic machine learning model to a specific experimental
reference case study enables the systematic analysis of the particle flux
emission as well as underlying system state (e.g., composition, mass density,
stress, point defect structure) evolution within process times of up to 45
minutes.

The energy spectrum of topological semimetals contains protected degeneracies
in reciprocal space that correspond to Weyl, Dirac, or multifold fermionic
states. To exploit the unconventional properties of these states, one has to
access the electronic structure of the three-dimensional bulk. In this work, we
resolve the bulk electronic states of candidate topological semimetal FeSi
using momentum-dependent resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Fe
$L_3$ edge. We observe a broad excitation continuum devoid of sharp features,
consistent with particle-hole scattering in an underlying electronic band
structure. Using density functional theory, we calculate the electronic
structure of FeSi and derive a band theory formulation of RIXS in the fast
collision approximation to model the scattering process. We find that band
theory qualitatively captures the number and position of the main spectral
features, as well as the overall momentum dependence of the RIXS intensity. Our
work paves the way for targeted studies of band touchings in topological
semimetals with RIXS.

While topological materials are not restricted to crystals, there is no
efficient method to diagnose topology in non-crystalline solids such as
amorphous materials. Here we introduce the structural spillage, a new indicator
that predicts the unknown topological phase of a non-crystalline solid, which
is compatible with first-principles calculations. We illustrate its potential
with tight-binding and first-principles calculations of amorphous bismuth,
predicting a bilayer to be a new topologically nontrivial material. Our work
opens up the efficient prediction of non-crystalline solids via
first-principles and high-throughput searches.

In this review, we outline the important results on the resistivity
encountered by an electron in magnetically ordered materials. The mechanism of
the collision between the electron and the lattice spins is shown. Experiments
on the spin resistivity in various magnetic materials as well as theoretical
background are recalled. We focus on our works since 15 years using principally
Monte Carlo simulations. In these works, we have studied the spin resistivity
in various kinds of magnetic systems ranging from ferromagnets and
antiferromagnets to frustrated spin systems. It is found that the spin
resistivity shows a broad peak at the transition temperature in systems with a
second-order phase transition, while it undergoes a discontinuous jump at the
transition temperature of a first-order transition. New results on the
hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) antiferromagnet are also shown in extended details
for the Ising case in both the frustrated and non-frustrated parameter regions.

Understanding the phase transition mechanisms in two-dimensional (2D)
materials is a key to precisely tailor their properties at the nanoscale.
Molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) exhibits multiple phases at room temperature,
making it a promising candidate for phase-change applications. Here, we
fabricate lateral 2H-Td interfaces with laser irradiation and probe their phase
transitions from micro- to atomic scales with in situ heating in the
transmission electron microscope (TEM). By encapsulating the MoTe2 with
graphene protection layers, we create an in situ reaction cell compatible with
atomic resolution imaging. We find that the Td-to-2H phase transition initiates
at phase boundaries at low temperatures (200-225 degree C) and propagates
anisotropically along the b-axis in a layer-by-layer fashion. We also
demonstrate a fully reversible 2H-Td-2H phase transition cycle, which generates
a coherent 2H lattice containing inversion domain boundaries. Our results
provide insights on fabricating 2D hetero-phase devices with atomically sharp
and coherent interfaces.

We demonstrate nonreciprocal critical current in 65 nm thick polycrystalline
and epitaxial Nb thin films patterned into tracks. The nonreciprocal behavior
gives a supercurrent diode effect, where the current passed in one direction is
a supercurrent and the other direction is a normal state (resistive) current.
We study the variation of the diode effect with temperature, magnetic field,
and the width of the Nb tracks from 2-10 $\mu$m. For both polycrystalline and
epitaxial samples, we find that tracks of width 4 $\mu$m provides the largest
supercurrent diode efficiency of up to $\approx30\%$, with the effect reducing
or disappearing in the widest tracks of 10 $\mu$m. It is anticipated that the
supercurrent diode will become a ubiquitous component of the superconducting
computer.

The isolation and control of disparate degrees of freedom underpin quantum
simulators. We advance the programmability of cold atom quantum simulators with
a first realization of the dynamic interplay of spatial and spin degrees of
freedom. We experimentally demonstrate that violent spatial evolutions tune
long-lived coherent spin dynamics and develop a model of quantum spin-mixing
incorporating the spatial evolution via time-dependent spin-spin interactions.
Our results open new paths towards the simulation of quantum spin models with
tunable interactions via tailored spatial dynamics.

Recently, the electride materials, with excess anionic electrons confined in
their empty space, have received a growing attention due to their promising
applications in catalysis, nonlinear optics and spin-electronics. However, the
utilization of electride materials is limited by their thermal instability.
Here we introduce an alternative way to achieve the localized anionic electron
states via the removal of high symmetric Wyckoff sites of anions from the
existing sodalite compounds. Using four halide sodalites as the parental
structures, our simulation reveals that the materials after the removal of
anionic halide sites exhibit typical electride behaviors that are characterized
by the existence of localized electronic states near the Fermi level. Compared
to most previously studied electrides, these materials are expected to be more
thermally stable due to the complex structural framework and thus promising for
practical applications. Among them, Na$_4$(AlSiO$_4$)$_3$ manifests magnetic
electronic structure. We demonstrate that this magnetism originates from a
highly localized excess electron state surrounded by electronpositive alkaline
cations. Our results suggest Na$_4$(AlSiO$_4$)$_3$ could be a promising
spintronics component, thus encouraging further experimental study.

Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) behavior in one-dimensional systems has been
predicted and shown to occur at semiconductor-to-metal transitions within
two-dimensional materials. Reports of mirror twin boundaries (MTBs) hosting a
Fermi liquid or a TLL have suggested a dependence on the underlying substrate,
however, unveiling the physical details of electronic contributions from the
substrate require cross-correlative investigation. Here, we study TLL formation
in MTBs within defectively engineered WS$_2$ atop graphene, where band
structure and the atomic environment is visualized with nano angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning
tunneling spectroscopy, and non-contact atomic force microscopy. Correlations
between the local density of states and electronic band dispersion elucidated
the electron transfer from graphene into a TLL hosted by MTB defects. We find
that MTB defects can be substantially charged at a local level, which drives a
band gap shift by $\sim$0.5 eV.

<h3>Two-dimensional topological insulator state in cadmium arsenide thin  films</h3>

Two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) are a highly desired quantum
phase but few materials have demonstrated clear signatures of a 2D TI state. It
has been predicted that 2D TIs can be created from thin films of
three-dimensional TIs by reducing the film thickness until the surface states
hybridize. Here, we employ this technique to report the first observation of a
2D TI state in epitaxial thin films of cadmium arsenide, a prototype Dirac
semimetal in bulk form and a 3D TI in thin films. Using magnetotransport
measurements with electrostatic gating, we observe a Landau level spectrum and
quantum Hall effect that are in excellent agreement with those of an ideal 2D
TI. Specifically, we observe a crossing of the zeroth Landau levels at a
critical magnetic field. We show that the film thickness can be used to tune
the critical magnetic field. Moreover, a larger change in film thickness causes
a transition from a 2D TI to a 2D trivial insulator, just as predicted by
theory. The high degree of tunability available in epitaxial cadmium arsenide
heterostructures can thus be used to fine-tune the 2D TI, which is essential
for future topological devices.

<h3>High-temperature thermoelectric properties with Th$_{3-x}$Te$_4$</h3>

Th$_3$Te$_4$ materials are potential candidates for commercial thermoelectric
(TE) materials at high-temperature due to their superior physical properties.
We incorporate the multiband Boltzmann transport equations with firstprinciples
calculations to theoretically investigate the TE properties of Th$_3$Te$_4$
materials. As a demonstration of our method, the TE properties of La$_3$Te$_4$
are similar with that of Ce$_3$Te$_4$ at low-temperature, which is consistent
with the experiment. Then we systematically calculate the electrical
conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the power factor of the two
materials above based on parameters obtained from first-principles calculations
as well as several other fitting parameters. Our results reveal that for the
electron--optical-phonon scattering at high temperatures, a linear dependence
of optical phonon energy on temperature explains better the experimental
results than a constant optical phonon energy. Based on this, we predict that
the TE properties of Ce$_3$Te$_4$ is better than La$_3$Te$_4$ at high
temperatures and the optimal carrier concentration corresponding to
Ce$_3$Te$_4$ shifts upward with increasing temperature. The optimal carrier
concentration of Ce$_3$Te$_4$ is around $1.6\times10^{21}$cm$^{-3}$ with the
peak power factor 13.07 $\mu$Wcm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at $T=1200$K.

<h3>Valley contrasting bulk photovoltaic effect in antiferromagnetic  MnPSe$_3$ monolayer</h3>

Valleytronics that uses the inequivalent electronic states at the band
extrema in semiconductors have been considered to play a vital role in the
future information read/write technology. In the current work, we theoretically
show that sizable valley contrasting bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect could
emerge, even when the total photocurrent is symmetrically forbidden. We
illustrate our theory by using a prototypical two-dimensional antiferromagnetic
semiconductor, MnPSe3 monolayer, that is PT-symmetric (P and T refer to
spatially inversion and time-reversal operators, respectively). We show that
the Neel vector well controls the magnetic point group at the $\Gamma$ point,
and the BPV current direction. In addition, $\mathbf{k}$-dependent photocurrent
generally arises due to the reduction of little group constraints at the
valley. This leads to hidden valley-polarized photoconductivity which could
reach a magnitude of 1350 $\mu$A/V&^2&, observable experimentally. We further
predict that the MnPSe$_3$ monolayer could be two-dimensional ferrotoroidic,
again depending on its Neel vector direction, which can be determined via
magnetoelectric response measurements. Our work provides an exemplary platform
for paving the route to future opto-spintronic and opto-valleytronic devices in
a single antiferromagnetic nanomaterial.

We study structural and magnetic properties of rare-earth based semimetals
RAuGe (R = Y, Gd-Tm, and Lu) using flux-grown single crystals. These compounds
belong to the noncentrosymmetric polar space group P63mc. We confirm the
systematic structural evolution at room temperature as a function of ionic
radius of rare earths to clarify the isopointal crossover between two polar
structures: three-dimensional LiGaGe-type and quasi-two-dimensional
NdPtSb-type. Magnetism shows a characteristic anisotropy in reasonable
agreement with the crystal electric field (CEF) theory; the easy-plane-type
anisotropy for R = Tb and Dy turns into the Ising-type anisotropy for R = Er
and Tm. We evaluate the CEF parameters based on the Stevens operators to
reasonably reproduce the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibilities
and specific heat for RAuGe (R = Tb-Tm). The estimated energy scale of the
Ising gap (~ 11 meV) in TmAuGe is consistent with an excitation observed in an
inelastic neutron scattering experiment. These findings suggest an opportunity
for interplay between conduction electrons and nontrivial spin structures in
the family of magnetic polar semimetals RAuGe.

Correlated electron materials (CEMs) host a rich variety of condensed matter
phases. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a prototypical CEM with a
temperature-dependent metal-to-insulator (MIT) transition with a concomitant
crystal symmetry change. External control of MIT in VO2 - especially without
inducing structural changes - has been a long-standing challenge. In this work,
we design and synthesize modulation-doped VO2-based thin film heterostructures
that closely emulate a textbook example of filling control in a correlated
electron insulator. Using a combination of charge transport, hard x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, and structural characterization, we show that the
insulating state can be doped to achieve carrier densities greater than 5x10^21
cm^(-3) without inducing any measurable structural changes. We find that the
MIT temperature (T_MIT) continuously decreases with increasing carrier
concentration. Remarkably, the insulating state is robust even at doping
concentrations as high as ~0.2 e-/vanadium. Finally, our work reveals
modulation-doping as a viable method for electronic control of phase
transitions in correlated electron oxides with the potential for use in future
devices based on electric-field controlled phase transitions.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of materials saturate to steady
states after severe plastic deformation (SPD). Despite the well-known effect of
temperature on the steady-state microstructure, there is no general agreement
on the significance of strain rate and the applicability of the Zener-Hollomon
parameter in this regard. In this study, several pure metals (aluminum, copper,
titanium, and iron) and a Cu-30Zn (wt%) brass alloy have been processed by a
high-speed high-pressure torsion (HPT) equipment with controllable rotation
speeds in the range of 0.06 to 60 rpm. It is found that crystallite/grain size,
dislocation density, microhardness and shear stress at the steady state are
reasonably rate-independent for the von Mises strain rates in the range of
0.004 to 20 s-1. Because both rates of grain refinement and of dynamic
recrystallization are proportional to the strain rate, it is suggested that
their balance, which determines the steady state, is rate-independent.

Despite high interest in compact and safe storage of hydrogen in the
solid-state hydride form, the design of alloys that can reversibly and quickly
store hydrogen at room temperature under pressures close to atmospheric
pressure is a long-lasting challenge. In this study, first-principles
calculations are combined with experiments to develop high-entropy alloys
(HEAs) for room-temperature hydrogen storage. TixZr2-xCrMnFeNi (x = 0.4-1.6)
alloys with the Laves phase structure and low hydrogen binding energies of -0.1
to -0.15 eV are designed and synthesized. The HEAs reversibly store hydrogen in
the form of Laves phase hydrides at room temperature, while (de)hydrogenation
pressure systematically reduces with increasing the zirconium fraction in good
agreement with the binding energy calculations. The kinetics of hydrogenation
are fast, the hydrogenation occurs without any activation or catalytic
treatment, the hydrogen storage performance remains stable for at least 1000
cycles, and the storage capacity is higher than that for commercial LaNi5. The
current findings demonstrate that a combination of theoretical calculations and
experiments is a promising pathway to design new high-entropy hydrides with
high performance for hydrogen storage.

<h3>Orthogonal magnetic structures of Fe4O5:representation analysis and DFT  calculations</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetic and electronic structures of Fe4O5 have been investigated at
ambient and high pressures via a combination of representation analysis,
density functional theory (DFT+U) calculations, and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. A
few spin configurations corresponding to the different irreducible
representations have been considered. The total-energy calculations reveal that
the magnetic ground state of Fe4O5 corresponds to an orthogonal spin order.
Depending on the magnetic propagation vector k two spin ordered phases with
minimal energy differences are realized. The lowest energy magnetic phase is
related to k = (0, 0, 0) and is characterized by the ferromagnetic ordering of
the iron magnetic moments at prismatic sites along the b axis and
antiferromagnetic ordering of iron moments at octahedral sites along the c
axis. For the k = (1/2, 0, 0) phase, the moments in the prisms are
antiferromagnetically ordered along the b axis and the moments in the octahedra
are still antiferromagnetically ordered along the c axis. Under high pressure,
the Fe4O5 exhibits magnetic transitions with corresponding electronic
transitions of the metal-insulator type. At a critical pressure PC ~ 60 GPa the
Fe ions at the octahedral sites undergo a high-spin to low-spin state crossover
with a decrease in the unit-cell volume of ~ 4%, while the Fe ions at the
prismatic sites remain in the high-spin state up to 130 GPa. This
site-dependent magnetic collapse is experimentally observed in the
transformation of M\"ossbauer spectra measured at room temperature and high
pressures.

We study the triangular plaquette model (TPM, also known as the Newman-Moore
model) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field on a lattice with
periodic boundaries in both spatial dimensions. We consider specifically the
approach to the ground state phase transition of this quantum TPM (QTPM, or
quantum Newman-Moore model) as a function of the system size and type of
boundary conditions. Using cellular automata methods, we obtain a full
characterization of the minimum energy configurations of the TPM for arbitrary
tori sizes. For the QTPM, we use these cycle patterns to obtain the symmetries
of the model, which we argue determine its quantum phase transition: we find it
to be a first-order phase transition, with the addition of spontaneous symmetry
breaking for system sizes which have degenerate classical ground states. For
sizes accessible to numerics, we also find that this classification is
consistent with exact diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Quantum Monte
Carlo simulations.

Superconducting topological metals (SCTMs) have recently emerged as a
promising platform of topological superconductivity (TSC) and Majorana zero
modes(MZMs) for quantum computation. Despite their importance in both
fundamental research and applications, SCTMs are very rare in nature. In
addition, some superconductors with topological electronic structures have been
reported recently, but a feasible program to determine their TSC properties is
still lacking. Here, we propose a new strategy to design SCTMs by intercalating
the superconducting units into the topological insulators. A program that
characterizes the superconducting BdG Chern number of 2D BdG Hamiltonian from
ab initio calculations is also developed. Following this strategy,
PdBi$_2$Te$_5$ and PdBi$_2$Te$_4$ are found to be experimentally synthesizable
and ideal SCTMs. Chiral TSC could be realized in such SCTMs by incorporating
topological surface states with Zeeman effect, which can be realized by an
external magnetic field or in proximity to ferromagnetic (FM) insulator. Our
strategy provides a new method for identifying the SCTMs and TSC candidates,
and the program makes it possible to design and modulate the TSC candidates
from ab initio calculations.

<h3>A one-dimensional model for axisymmetric deformations of an inflated  hyperelastic tube of finite wall thickness</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02845" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02845</a>
<br>
<i>Xiang Yu, Yibin Fu</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive a one-dimensional (1d) model for the analysis of bulging or necking
in an inflated hyperelastic tube of {\it finite wall thickness} from the
three-dimensional finite elasticity theory by applying the dimension reduction
methodology proposed by Audoly and Hutchinson (J. Mech. Phys. Solids,
\textbf{97}, 2016). The 1d model makes it much easier to characterize fully
nonlinear axisymmetric deformations of a thick-walled tube using simple
numerical schemes such as the finite difference method. The new model recovers
the diffuse interface model for analyzing bulging in a membrane tube and the 1d
model for investigating necking in a stretched solid cylinder as two limiting
cases. It is consistent with, but significantly refines, the exact linear and
weakly nonlinear bifurcation analyses. Comparisons with finite element
simulations show that for the bulging problem, the 1d model is capable of
describing the entire bulging process accurately, from initiation, growth, to
propagation. The 1d model provides a stepping stone from which similar 1d
models can be derived and used to study other effects such as anisotropy and
electric loading, and other phenomena such as rupture.

<h3>Absence of off-diagonal long-range order in hcp $^{\bf 4}$He dislocation  cores</h3>

<br>
<br>
The mass transport properties along dislocation cores in hcp $^4$He are
revisited by considering two types of edge dislocations as well as a screw
dislocation, using a fully correlated quantum simulation approach.
Specifically, we employ the zero-temperature path-integral ground state (PIGS)
method together with ergodic sampling of the permutation space to investigate
the fundamental dislocation core structures and their off-diagonal long-range
order properties. It is found that the Bose-Einstein condensate fraction of
such defective $^4$He systems is practically null ($\le 10^{-6}$), just as in
the bulk defect-free crystal. These results provide compelling evidence for the
absence of intrinsic superfluidity in dislocation cores in hcp $^4$He and
challenge the superfluid dislocation-network interpretation of the
mass-flux-experiment observations, calling for further experimental
investigation.

<br>
<br>
Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B's unsurpassed, hard magnetic properties for a wide range of
temperatures result from a combination of a large volume magnetization from Fe
and a strong single-ion anisotropy from Nd. Here, using finite temperature
first-principles calculations, we focus on the other crucial roles played by
the Fe atoms in maintaining the magnetic order on the Nd sublattices, and hence
the large magnetic anisotropy, and directly generating significant uniaxial
anisotropy at high temperatures. We identify effective spins for atomistic
modelling from the material's interacting electrons and {quantify pairwise and
higher order, non-pairwise magnetic interactions among them. We find the Nd
spins couple most strongly to spins on sites belonging to two specific Fe
sublattices, 8$j_1$, 8$j_2$. Moreover the Fe 8$j_1$ sublattice also provides
the electronic origin of the unusual, nonmonotonic temperature dependence of
the anisotropy of Y$_2$Fe$_{14}$B.} Our work provides atomic-level resolution
of the properties of this fascinating magnetic material.

<h3>First Principles Assessment of CdTe as a Tunnel Barrier at the  $\mathbfα$-Sn/InSb Interface</h3>

<br>
<br>
Majorana zero modes, with prospective applications in topological quantum
computing, are expected to arise in superconductor/semiconductor interfaces,
such as $\beta$-Sn and InSb. However, proximity to the superconductor may also
adversely affect the semiconductor's local properties. A tunnel barrier
inserted at the interface could resolve this issue. We assess the wide band gap
semiconductor, CdTe, as a candidate material to mediate the coupling at the
lattice-matched interface between $\alpha$-Sn and InSb. To this end, we use
density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U corrections, whose values are
machine-learned via Bayesian optimization (BO) [npj Computational Materials 6,
180 (2020)]. The results of DFT+U(BO) are validated against angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments for $\alpha$-Sn and CdTe. For
CdTe, the z-unfolding method [Advanced Quantum Technologies, 5, 2100033 (2022)]
is used to resolve the contributions of different $k_z$ values to the ARPES. We
then study the band offsets and the penetration depth of metal-induced gap
states (MIGS) in bilayer interfaces of InSb/$\alpha$-Sn, InSb/CdTe, and
CdTe/$\alpha$-Sn, as well as in tri-layer interfaces of InSb/CdTe/$\alpha$-Sn
with increasing thickness of CdTe. We find that 16 atomic layers (3.5 nm) of
CdTe can serve as a tunnel barrier, effectively shielding the InSb from MIGS
from the $\alpha$-Sn. This may guide the choice of dimensions of the CdTe
barrier to mediate the coupling in semiconductor-superconductor devices in
future Majorana zero modes experiments.

<h3>Disorder-induced finite center-of-mass momentum Cooper pairing and its  consequences to the critical temperature and superconducting gap of overdoped  cuprates</h3>

<br>
<br>
One of the most studied classes of unconventional high-temperature
superconductors is the hole-doped cuprates, where special attention is given to
those doped with extra interstitial oxygens. In this context, the formation of
spatially inhomogeneous agglomerates of dopant oxygen atoms in the form of
nanosized puddles is not only relevant, but also subject of intense recent
experimental and theoretical surveys. Following these efforts, in this work we
show the consequences of the presence of networks of oxygen puddles in the
superconducting state of overdoped cuprates. Starting from the inhomogeneous
disordered background brought by the network of puddles, we show that an
effective interaction between electrons can be mediated by the local
vibrational degrees of freedom of each puddle, but the pairs arising from this
interaction have a finite center-of-mass momentum $\mathbf{p}$, thus breaking
up the Cooper channel. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the
amplitude of the superconducting gap $\Delta_\mathbf{k}$ in terms of disorder
and finite center-of-mass momentum and show that amplitude fluctuations are
induced in the superconducting state by the presence of the puddles, where both
the gap and the critical temperature are affect and reduced by disorder and
finite momentum pairs. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of
networks of superconducting oxygen nano-puddles in cuprates.

<h3>Renewal equations for single-particle diffusion in multi-layered media</h3>

In this paper we develop a probabilistic model of single-particle diffusion
in 1D multi-layered media by constructing a multi-layered version of so-called
snapping out Brownian motion (BM). The latter sews together successive rounds
of reflected BM, each of which is restricted to a single layer. Each round of
reflected BM is killed when the local time at one end of the layer exceeds an
independent, exponentially distributed random variable. (The local time
specifies the amount of time a reflected Brownian particle spends in a
neighborhood of a boundary.) The particle then immediately resumes reflected BM
in the same layer or the layer on the other side of the boundary with equal
probability, and the process is iterated We proceed by constructing a last
renewal equation for multi-layered snapping out BM that relates the full
probability density to the probability densities of partially reflected BM in
each layer. We then show how transfer matrices can be used to solve the Laplace
transformed renewal equation, and prove that the renewal equation and
corresponding multi-layer diffusion equation are equivalent. We illustrate the
theory by analyzing the first passage time (FPT) problem for escape at the
exterior boundaries of the domain. Finally, we use the renewal approach to
incorporate a generalization of snapping out BM based on the encounter-based
method for surface absorption; each round of reflected BM is now killed
according to a non-exponential distribution for each local time threshold. This
is achieved by considering a corresponding first renewal equation that relates
the full probability density to the FPT densities for killing each round of
reflected BM. We show that for certain configurations, non-exponential killing
leads to an effective time-dependent permeability that is normalizable but
heavy-tailed.

The present study reports the catalytic action of two-dimensional (2D)
layered materials (MoS2 and WS2) for improving the de/re-hydrogenation kinetics
of MgH2. The MgH2 start desorbing at 277 C with a hydrogen storage capacity of
5.95 wt% in the presence of WS2 catalyst whereas onset desorption temperature
of MgH2 catalyzed by MoS2 is 330 C. The MgH2-WS2 absorbed hydrogen ~ 3.72 wt%
within 1.3 minutes at 300 C under 13 atm hydrogen pressure and it desorbed
~5.57 wt% within 20 minutes at 300 C under 1 atm hydrogen pressure. We have
performed 25 cycles of dehydrogenation (under 1 atm hydrogen pressure at 300 C)
and re-hydrogenation (under 13 atm hydrogen pressure at 300 {\deg}C) to ensure
cyclic stability of catalyzed version of MgH2 where MgH2-WS2 shows better
cyclic stability than MgH2-MoS2. MgH2-WS2 also shows the lower reaction
activation energy ~117 kJ/mol as compare to other catalyzed and uncatalyzed
samples. On the other hand, these catalysts (WS2 and MoS2) do not have any
impact on the thermodynamical parameters that is change in enthalpy.

accompanied by the emission of Leggett plasmons has been found for the first
time in $MgB_2$ Josephson contacts. A fine structure in the CVCs of $MgB_2$
Andreev point contacts caused by a resonant emission of Leggett plasmons has
been observed for the first time. An energy of the Leggett plasmon has been
estimated: $E_0$ ~ 4 meV. Distinct two-gap structures have been found in the
CVCs of $MgB_2$ tunneling contacts and $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts with 7.5
meV $< \Delta_L <$ 11 meV and 1.5 meV $< \Delta_S <$ 2.5 meV. An intrinsic
tunneling effect (ITE) and intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect
(IMARE) have been observed due to the layered structure of $MgB_2$. The
obtained experimental results give a direct evidence for a two-gap
superconductivity in $MgB_2$. ("V. Tarasov's Readings", November 2002, Russia,

<br>
The diffusion of molecules (penetrants) of variable size, shape, and
chemistry through dense crosslinked polymer networks is a fundamental
scientific problem that is broadly relevant in materials, polymer, physical and
biological chemistry. Relevant applications include molecular separations in
membranes, barrier materials for coatings, drug delivery, and nanofiltration. A
major open question is the relationship between molecular transport,
thermodynamic state, and chemical structure of the penetrant and polymeric
media. Here we address this question by combining experiment, simulation, and
theory to unravel the competing effects of penetrant chemistry on its transport
in rubbery and supercooled polymer permanent networks over a wide range of
crosslink densities, size ratios, and temperatures. The crucial importance of
the coupling of local penetrant hopping to the polymer structural relaxation
process, and the secondary importance of geometric mesh confinement effects,
are established. Network crosslinks induce a large slowing down of nm-scale
polymer relaxation which greatly retards the rate of penetrant activated
relaxation. The demonstrated good agreement between experiment, simulation, and
theory provides strong support for the size ratio variable (effective penetrant
diameter to the polymer Kuhn length) as a key variable, and the usefulness of
coarse-grained simulation and theoretical models that average over Angstrom
scale chemical details. The developed microscopic theory provides a fundamental
understanding of the physical processes underlying the behaviors observed in
experiment and simulation. Penetrant transport is theoretically predicted to
become even more size sensitive in a more deeply supercooled regime not probed
in our present experiments or simulations, which suggests new strategies for
enhancing selective polymer membrane design.

We study numerically the dynamics of acetanilide (ACN) molecules placed on a
flat surface of a multilayer hexagonal boron nitride structure. We demonstrate
that the ACN molecules, being achiral in three dimensions, become chiral after
being placed on the substrate. Homochirality of the ACN molecules leads to
stable secondary structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds between peptide groups
of the molecules. Numerical simulations of systems of such molecules reveal
that the structure of the resulting hydrogen-bond chains depends on the
isomeric composition of the molecules. If all molecules are homochiral (i.e.
only one isomer is present), they form secondary structures (chains of hydrogen
bonds in the shapes of arcs, circles, and spirals). If the molecules at the
substrate form a racemic mixture, then no regular secondary structures appear,
and only curvilinear chains of hydrogen bonds of random shapes can emerge. A
hydrogen-bond chain can form a straight zigzag only if it has an alternation of
isomers. Such chains can create two-dimensional (2D) regular lattices, or 2D
crystals. The melting scenarios of such 2D crystals depend on density of its
coverage of the substrate. At 25% coverage, melting occurs continuously in a
certain temperature interval. For a complete coverage, melting occurs at
415-470 K due to a shift of 11% of all molecules into the second layer of the
substrate.

Superresolution microscopy has become a powerful tool to investigate the
internal structure of complex colloidal and polymeric systems, such as
microgels, at the nanometer scale. The ability to monitor microgels response to
temperature changes in situ opens new and exciting opportunities to design and
precisely control their behaviour for various applications. When performing
advanced microscopy experiments, interactions between the particle and the
environment can be important. Often microgels are deposited on a substrate
since they have to remain still for several minutes during the experiment. This
study uses dSTORM microscopy and advanced coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate, for the first time, how individual microgels
anchored on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces undergo their volume phase
transition in temperature. We find that, in the presence of a hydrophilic
substrate, the structure of the microgel is unperturbed and the resulting
density profiles quantitatively agree with simulations performed in bulk
conditions. Instead, when a hydrophobic surface is used, the microgel spreads
at the interface and an interesting competition between the two hydrophobic
strengths -- monomer-monomer vs monomer-surface -- comes into play at high
temperatures. The remarkable agreement between experiments and simulations
makes the present study a fundamental step to establish this high-resolution
monitoring technique as a platform for investigating more complex systems,
being these either macromolecules with peculiar internal structure or
nanocomplexes where molecules of interest can be encapsulated in the microgel
network and controllably released with temperature.

We present the fingerprints of dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of K$_2$RuCl$_6$. We determined the
dynamic Jahn-Teller model Hamiltonian of an embedded Ru$^{4+}$ ion using post
Hartree-Fock methods, and derived the vibronic states by numerically
diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. With the obtained vibronic states, we reproduced
the RIXS spectra. The shape and the temperature dependence of the RIXS spectrum
agree well with the experimental data. We found that some peaks emerge due to
the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect rather than the crystal field splitting. Our
study indicates the significance of the Jahn-Teller coupling to adequately
interpret RIXS spectra.

The discovery of a chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals, the non-conservation of
chiral charge and energy across two opposite chirality Weyl nodes, has sparked
immense interest in understanding its impact on various physical phenomena.
Here, we demonstrate the existence of electrical, thermal, and gravitational
quantum chiral anomalies in 3D spin-orbit coupled systems. Notably, these
anomalies involve chiral charge transfer across two Fermi surfaces linked to a
single Weyl-like point, rather than across opposite chirality Weyl nodes as in
Weyl semimetals. Our findings reveal that the Berry curvature flux piercing the
Fermi surface plays a critical role in distinguishing the `chirality' of the
carriers and the corresponding chiral charge and energy transfer. Importantly,
we demonstrate that these quantum chiral anomalies lead to interesting thermal
spin transport such as the spin Nernst effect. Our results suggest that 3D
spin-orbit coupled metals offer a promising platform for investigating the
interplay between quantum chiral anomalies and charge and spin transport in
non-relativistic systems.

The layered crystal structure of Cr2Ge2Te6 shows ferromagnetic ordering at
the two-dimensional limit, which holds promise for spintronic applications.
However, external voltage pulses can trigger amorphization of the material in
nanoscale electronic devices, and it is unclear whether the loss of structural
ordering leads to a change in magnetic properties. Here, we demonstrate that
Cr2Ge2Te6 preserves the spin-polarized nature in the amorphous phase, but
undergoes a magnetic transition to a spin glass state below 20 K.
Quantum-mechanical computations reveal the microscopic origin of this
transition in spin configuration: it is due to strong distortions of the
Cr-Te-Cr bonds, connecting chromium-centered octahedra, and to the overall
increase in disorder upon amorphization. The tunable magnetic properties of
Cr2Ge2Te6 could be exploited for multifunctional, magnetic phase-change devices
that switch between crystalline and amorphous states.

A WSe2 monolayer of 1T' phase is a large band gap quantum spin Hall
insulator, supporting dissipationless charge and spin transports through the
topologically protected edge states. In this work, we explore the nanoribbon
forms of 1T' phase WSe2 by first-principles density functional calculations and
the many-body perturbation GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation method. We found that
the 1T' WSe2 nanoribbon can show topological edge states with a ribbon width of
~4-6 nm. Those edge bands show odd-time crossing through the Fermi level, with
each edge band showing one kind of spin-polarization. The topological features
of the edge bands are robust and unaffected by small bending in the nanoribbon,
while large bending induces large band splitting, resulting in a topological
switch-off in the edge bands. The semiconducting 1T' WSe2 nanoribbon shows a
large tunability with bending in optical absorption spectra and exciton states.
The lowest-energy exciton is changed from optically dark in the flat nanoribbon
to bright in the bent nanoribbons. These properties in the 1T' WSe2 nanoribbons
suggest potential applications in controllable quantum electronics and
exciton-based quantum information processes.

Converting light into steady currents and spin-currents in two-dimensional
(2D) platform is essential for future energy harvesting and spintronics. We
show that the giant and modulable bulk photovoltaic effects (BPVEs) can be
achieved in air-stable 2D antiferromagnet (AFM) monolayer MnPSe3, with
nonlinear photoconductance > 4000 nm$\cdot\mu$A/V2 and photo-spin-conductance >
2000 (nm$\cdot\mu$A/V2 $\hbar$/2e) in the visible spectrum. The propagation and
the spin-polarizations of photocurrents can be switched via simply rotating the
N$\'e$el vector. We unveil that the PT-symmetry, mirror symmetries, and
spin-orbital-couplings are the keys for the observed sizable and controllable
2D BPVEs. All the results provide insights into the BPVEs of 2D AFM, and
suggest that the layered MnPSe3 is an outstanding 2D platform for energy device
and photo-spintronics.

Local gauge symmetry is intriguing for the study of quantum thermalization
breaking. For example, in the confined lattice Schwinger model (LSM), the local
U(1) gauge symmetry underlies the disorder-free many-body localization (MBL)
dynamics of matter fields. This phenomenon, however, would not occur in a
deconfined spin-1/2 LSM due to the absence of electric energy in the
Hamiltonian. In this paper, we show that the spin-1/2 LSM can also exhibit
disorder-free MBL dynamics, as well as prethermalization, by introducing a
four-fermion interaction into the system. The interplay between the fermion
interaction and U(1) gauge symmetry endows the gauge fields with an effectively
disordered potential being responsible for the thermalization breaking. It
induces anomalous (i.e., non-thermal) behaviors to occur in the long-time
evolution of such quantities as local observables, entanglement entropy, and
correlation functions. Our work offers a new opportunity to explore emergent
non-thermal dynamics in state-of-the-art quantum simulators with gauge
symmetries.

<h3>Exploring high thermal conductivity polymers via interpretable machine  learning with physical descriptors</h3>

The efficient and economical exploitation of polymers with high thermal
conductivity is essential to solve the issue of heat dissipation in organic
devices. Currently, the experimental preparation of functional thermal
conductivity polymers remains a trial and error process due to the
multi-degrees of freedom during the synthesis and characterization process. In
this work, we have proposed a high-throughput screening framework for polymer
chains with high thermal conductivity via interpretable machine learning and
physical-feature engineering. The polymer thermal conductivity datasets for
training were first collected by molecular dynamics simulation. Inspired by the
drug-like small molecule representation and molecular force field, 320 polymer
monomer descriptors were calculated and the 20 optimized descriptors with
physical meaning were extracted by hierarchical down-selection. All the machine
learning models achieve a prediction accuracy R2 greater than 0.80, which is
superior to that of represented by traditional graph descriptors. Further, the
cross-sectional area and dihedral stiffness descriptors were identified for
positive/negative contribution to thermal conductivity, and 107 promising
polymer structures with thermal conductivity greater than 20.00 W/mK were
obtained. Mathematical formulas for predicting the polymer thermal conductivity
were also constructed by using symbolic regression. The high thermal
conductivity polymer structures are mostly {\pi}-conjugated, whose overlapping
p-orbitals enable easily to maintain strong chain stiffness and large group
velocities. The proposed data-driven framework should facilitate the
theoretical and experimental design of polymers with desirable properties.

We investigate the spectrum of spin conductivity for a miscible two-component
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that exhibits spin superfluidity. By using the
Bogoliubov theory, the regular part being the spin conductivity at finite ac
frequency and the spin Drude weight characterizing the delta-function peak at
zero frequency are analytically computed. We demonstrate that the spectrum
exhibits a power-law behavior at low frequency, reflecting gapless density and
spin modes specific to the binary BEC. At the phase transition points into
immiscible and quantum-droplet states, the change in quasiparticle dispersion
relations modifies the power law. In addition, the spin Drude weight becomes
finite, indicating zero spin resistivity due to spin superfluidity. Our results
also suggest that the Andreev-Bashkin drag density is accessible by measuring
the spin conductivity spectrum.

<h3>Hybrid Nodal-chain Semimetal State in MgCaN2</h3>

The distinct over-tilting of band crossings in topological semimetal
generates the type-I and typeII classification of Dirac/Weyl and nodal-line
fermions, accompanied by the exotic electronic and magnetic transport
properties. In this work, we propose a concept of hybrid nodal-chain semimetal,
which is identified by the linked type-I and type-II nodal rings in the
Brillouin zone. Based on first-principles calculations and swarm-intelligence
structure search technique, a new ternary nitride MgCaN2 crystal is proposed as
the first candidate to realize a novel 3D hybrid nodal-chain state. Remarkably,
a flat band is emergent as a characteristic signature of such a hybrid
nodal-chain along certain direction in the momentum space, thereby serving a
platform to explore the interplay between topological semimetal state and flat
band. Moreover, the underlying protection mechanism of the hybrid nodal-chain
is revealed by calculating the mirror Z2 invariant and developing a k.p
effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, considerable drumhead-like surface states
with unique connection patterns are illustrated to identify the non-trivial
band topology, which may be measured by future experiments.

Studies on systems far from equilibrium open up new avenues for investigating
exotic phases of matter. A driven-dissipative frustrated spin system is
examined in this study, and we suggest an out-of-equilibrium non-magnetic phase
where the spins do not order but adhere to the ice rule in space and establish
a long-range crystalline order in time. It is shown that this time-crystalline
spin ice phase is distinct from the equilibrium spin ice and conventional
discrete time crystal. The dynamics of monopoles, Dirac strings and other
space-time topological defects have been examined in the context of this
far-from-equilibrium system, and the possible experimental realization of our
model has been discussed.

<br>
To date, the most widely-studied quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI)
platform is achieved by dilute doping of magnetic ions into thin films of the
alloyed tetradymite topological insulator (TI) (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$
(BST). In these films, long-range magnetic ordering of the transition metal
substituants opens an exchange gap $\Delta$ in the topological surface states,
stabilizing spin-polarized, dissipationless edge channels with a nonzero Chern
number $\mathcal{C}$. The long-range ordering of the spatially separated
magnetic ions is itself mediated by electronic states in the host TI, leading
to a sophisticated feedback between magnetic and electronic properties. Here we
present a study of the electronic and magnetic response of a BST-based QAHI
system to structural tuning via hydrostatic pressure. We identify a systematic
closure of the topological gap under compressive strain accompanied by a
simultaneous enhancement in the magnetic ordering strength. Combining these
experimental results with first-principle calculations we identify structural
deformation as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase
space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST system.

In this article, we study an exponential decay for the gas of bosons with
strong repulsive delta interactions from a double-well potential. We consider
an exactly solvable model comprising an infinite wall and two Dirac delta
barriers. We explore its features both within the exact method and with the
resonance expansion approach. The study reveals the effect of the splitting
barrier on the decay rate in dependence on the number of particles. Among other
things, we find that the effect of the splitting barrier on the decay rate is
most pronounced in systems with odd particle numbers. During exponential decay,
the spatial correlations in an internal region are well captured by the
"radiating state".

<br>
<br>
The $q$-neighbor Ising model for the opinion formation on multiplex networks
with two layers in the form of random graphs (duplex networks), the partial
overlap of nodes, and LOCAL\&AND spin update rule was investigated by means of
the pair approximation and approximate Master equations as well as Monte Carlo
simulations. Both analytic and numerical results show that for different fixed
sizes of the $q$-neighborhood and finite mean degrees of nodes within the
layers the model exhibits qualitatively similar critical behavior as the
analogous model on multiplex networks with layers in the form of complete
graphs. However, as the mean degree of nodes is decreased the discontinuous
ferromagnetic transition, the tricritical point separating it from the
continuous transition and the possible coexistence of the paramagnetic and
ferromagnetic phases at zero temperature occur for smaller relative sizes of
the overlap. Predictions of the simple homogeneous pair approximation
concerning the critical behavior of the model under study show good qualitative
agreement with numerical results; predictions based on the approximate Master
equations are usually quantitatively more accurate, but yet not exact. Two
versions of the heterogeneous pair approximation are also derived for the model
under study, which, surprisingly, yield predictions only marginally different
or even identical to those of the simple homogeneous pair approximation. In
general, predictions of all approximations show better agreement with the
results of Monte Carlo simulations in the case of continuous than discontinuous
ferromagnetic transition.

Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are widely applied in electronic
and photonic applications, such as non-volatile memory and neuro-inspired
computing. Doped Sb$_2$Te alloys have won the market of rewritable optical
discs in the 1990s, and are now gaining increasing attention for on-chip
photonic applications, due to their growth-driven crystallization features.
However, it remains unknown whether Sb$_2$Te also forms a metastable
crystalline phase upon nanoseconds crystallization in devices, similar to the
case of nucleation-driven Ge-Sb-Te alloys. Here, we carry out thorough ab
initio simulations to understand the structural evolution and changes in
optical properties of amorphous Sb$_2$Te upon heating and atomic ordering. We
show that the crystallized phase of Sb$_2$Te forms a disordered rhombohedral
structure, and additional tellurium ordering reduces the total energy, leading
to the ordered rhombohedral ground state. During the continuous transformation
process, changes in the dielectric function are highly wavelength-dependent
from the visible-light range towards the telecommunication band. Our
finite-difference time-domain simulations based on the ab initio input reveal
key differences in device output for color display and photonic memory
applications upon tellurium ordering, pointing towards different strategies for
device programming. Our work serves as an example of how multiscale simulations
of materials can guide practical photonic phase-change applications.

<h3>Cluster Formation and Relaxation in Particle Rafts under Uniform Radial  Expansion</h3>

Particle rafts floating at an air-liquid interface exhibit a variety of
behaviors when interfacial flow is introduced. Motivated by previous
experimental observations, the failure pattern of particle rafts under uniform
radial expansion is reported in this paper. The expansion process is
specifically designed to expand the system affinely in the radial direction and
to keep the velocity gradient constant throughout. A strong resemblance to the
results of particle rafts under uniform uniaxial expansion[1] is found. The
size of the cluster emerging as the rafts are pulled apart scales inversely
with the pulling velocity. This is a result of two competing velocities: the
inter-particle separation speed provided by the flow and a size-dependent
relaxation speed for clustering. A model, generalized from a one-dimensional
linear (in)stability calculation, is in agreement with the failure morphology
found for this radially expanded system. Nonlinear relaxation and particle
rearrangement is observed after the initial clustering occurs. This is a
feature unique to a two-dimensional system. With its easily accessible particle
dynamics at the microscopic level, this system provides insights into the
morphology controlled by two competing mechanisms in two or higher dimensions
and across different scales.

In this work, we study the information scrambling and the entanglement
dynamics in the complex Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cBSYK) models, focusing on
their dependence on the charge density $n$. We first derive the effective
theory for scramblons in a single cBSYK model, which gives closed-form
expressions for the late-time OTOC and operator size. In particular, the result
for OTOC is consistent with numerical observations in
\cite{agarwal2022emergent}. We then study the entanglement dynamics in cBSYK
chains. We derive the density dependence of the entanglement velocity for both
R\'enyi entropies and the Von Neumann entropy, with a comparison to the
butterfly velocity. We further consider adding repeated measurements and derive
the effective theory of the measurement induced transition which shows
$U(2)_L\otimes U(2)_R$ symmetry for non-interacting models.

Graphene-silicon Schottky junction (GSJ) which has the potential for
large-scale manufacturing and integration can bring new opportunities to
Schottky solar cells for photovoltaic (PV) power conversion. However, the
essential power conversion limitation for these devices lies in the small
open-circuit voltage ($V_{oc}$), which depends on the Schottky barrier height
(SBH). In this study, we introduce an electromechanical method based on the
flexoelectric effect to enhance the PV efficiency in GSJ. By atomic force
microscope (AFM) tip-based indentation and in situ current measurement, the
current-voltage (I-V) responses under flexoelectric strain gradient are
obtained. The $V_{oc}$ is observed to increase for up to 20$\%$, leading to an
evident improvement of the power conversion efficiency. Our studies suggest
that strain gradient may offer unprecedented opportunities for the development
of GSJ based flexo-photovoltaic applications.

We classify the dissipative topological insulators (TIs) with edge dark
states (EDS) by using the 38-fold way of non-Hermitian systems in this paper.
The dissipative dynamics of these quadratic open fermionic systems is captured
by a non-Hermitian single-particle matrix which contains both the internal
dynamics and the dissipation, refereed to as damping matrix $X$. And the dark
states in these systems are the eigenmodes of $X$ which the eigenvalues'
imaginary part vanishes. However, there is a constraint on $X$, namely that the
modes in which the eigenvalues' imaginary parts are positive are forbidden. In
other words, the imaginary line-gap of $X$ is ill-defined, so the topological
band theory classifying the dark states can not be applied to $X$. To reveal
the topological protection of EDS, we propose the double damping matrix
$\tilde{X} = \text{diag}\left( X, X^* \right)$, where the imaginary line-gap is
well defined. Thus, the 38-fold way can be applied to $\tilde{X}$, and the
topological protection of the EDS is uncovered. Different from previous studies
of EDS in purely dissipative dynamics, the EDS in the dissipative TIs are
robust against the inclusion of Hamiltonians. Furthermore, the topological
classification of $\tilde{X}$ not only reflects the topological protection of
EDS in dissipative TIs but also provides a paradigm to predict the appearance
of EDS in other open free fermionic systems.

When a magnon passes through two-dimensional magnetic textures, it will
experience a fictitious magnetic field originating from the $3\times 3$
skew-symmetric gauge fields. To date, only one of the three independent
components of the gauge fields has been found to play a role in generating the
fictitious magnetic field while the rest two are perfectly hidden. In this
work, we show that they are concealed in the nonlinear magnon transport in
magnetic textures. Without loss of generality, we theoretically study the
nonlinear magnon-skyrmion interaction in antiferromagnets. By analyzing the
scattering features of three-magnon processes between the circularly-polarized
incident magnon and breathing skyrmion, we predict a giant Hall angle of both
the confluence and splitting modes. Furthermore, we find that the Hall angle
reverses its sign when one switches the handedness of the incident magnons. We
dub it nonlinear topological magnon spin Hall effect. Our findings are deeply
rooted in the bosonic nature of magnons that the particle number is not
conserved, which has no counterpart in low-energy fermionic systems, and may
open the door for probing gauge fields by nonlinear means.

The effective independent-particle (mean-field) approximation of the Hubbard
Hamiltonian is described in a many-body basis to develop a formal comparison
with the exact diagonalization of the full Hubbard model, using small atomic
chain as test systems. This allows for the development of an intuitive
understanding of the shortcomings of the mean-field approximation and of how
critical correlation effects are missed in this popular approach. The
description in the many-body basis highlights a potential ambiguity related to
the definition of the density of states. Specifically, satellite peaks are
shown to emerge in the mean-field approximation, in departure from the common
belief that they characterize correlation effects. The scheme emphasizes the
importance of correlation and how different many-body corrections can improve
the mean-field description. The pedagogical treatment is expected to make it
possible for researchers to acquire an improved understanding of many-body
effects as found in various areas related to electronic properties of molecules
and solids, which is highly relevant to current efforts in quantum information
and quantum computing.

Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems
offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic
properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs-based systems are
relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve
structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition
temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was
realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic
structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure,
resulting in a record-high Tc among all synthesized SnAs-based compounds.
Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out-of-plane pz orbital to
the in-plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D
lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p-orbital
following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective
strategy to modify layered superconductors.

The high-quality structures containing semiconducting transition metal
dichalcogenides (S-TMDs) monolayer (MLs) required for optical and electrical
studies are achieved by their encapsulation in hexagonal BN (hBN) flakes. To
examine the effect of hBN thickness in these systems, we consider a model with
an S-TMD ML placed between a semi-infinite in the out-of-plane direction
substrate and complex top cover layers: a layer of finite thickness, adjacent
to the ML, and a semi-infinite in the out-of-plane direction top part. We
obtain the expression for the Coulomb potential. Using this result we
demonstrate that the energies of excitonic $s$ states in the structure with
WSe$_2$ ML change significantly for the top hBN with thickness $<$30 layers. We
observed that the excitonic binding energy ($E_b$) is reduced by almost 40\% in
the transition from the sample without the top hBN layer ($E_b$=256 meV) to the
one with an infinite thickness of the top hBN layer ($E_b$=165 meV).

Element-specific spectroscopies using synchrotron-radiation can provide
unique insights into materials properties. The recently developed technique of
X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) allows studying the magnetization
dynamics of magnetic spin structures. Magnetic sensitivity in XFMR is obtained
from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) effect, where the phase of
the magnetization precession of each magnetic layer with respect to the
exciting radio frequency is obtained using stroboscopic probing of the spin
precession. Measurement of both amplitude and phase response in the magnetic
layers as a function of bias field can give a clear signature of spin-transfer
torque (STT) coupling between ferromagnetic layers due to spin pumping. Over
the last few years, there have been new developments utilizing X-ray scattering
techniques to reveal the precessional magnetization dynamics of ordered spin
structures in the GHz frequency range. The techniques of diffraction and
reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance (DFMR and RFMR) provide novel ways for
the probing of the dynamics of chiral and multilayered magnetic materials,
thereby opening up new pathways for the development of high-density and
low-energy consumption data processing solutions.

<h3>Dynamical large deviations for an inhomogeneous wave kinetic theory:  linear wave scattering by a random medium</h3>

The wave kinetic equation predicts the averaged temporal evolution of a
continuous spectral density of waves either randomly interacting or scattered
by the fine structure of a medium. In a wide range of systems, the wave kinetic
equation is derived from a fundamental equation of wave motion, which is
symmetric through time-reversal. By contrast, the corresponding wave kinetic
equation is time-irreversible. A similar paradox appears whenever one makes a
mesoscopic description of the evolution of a very large number of microscopic
degrees of freedom. Recently, it has been understood that the kinetic
description itself, at a mesoscopic level, should not break time-reversal
symmetry. The proper theoretical or mathematical tool to derive a mesoscopic
time-reversal stochastic process is large deviation theory, for which the
deterministic wave kinetic equation appears as the most probable evolution.
This paper follows Bouchet (2020) and a series of other works that derive the
large deviation Hamiltonians of the classical kinetic theories. We propose a
derivation of the large deviation principle for the linear scattering of waves
by a weak random potential in an inhomogeneous situation. This problem involves
microscopic scales corresponding to the typical wavelengths and periods of the
waves and mesoscopic ones which are the scales of spatial inhomogeneities in
the spectral density and the time needed for the random scatterers to alter the
wave spectrum. The main assumption of the kinetic regime is a large separation
of these microscopic and mesoscopic scales. We choose a generic model of wave

Superconductor-ferromagnet tunnel junctions demonstrate giant thermoelectric
effects which are being exploited to engineer ultra-sensitive terahertz
radiation detectors. Here, we experimentally observe the recently predicted
complete magnetic control over thermoelectric effects in a superconducting spin
valve, including the dependence of its sign on the magnetic state of the spin
valve. The description of the experimental results is improved by the
introduction of an interfacial domain wall in the spin filter layer interfacing
the superconductor. Surprisingly, the application of high in-plane magnetic
fields induces a double sign inversion of the thermoelectric effect, which
exhibits large values even at applied fields twice the superconducting critical
field.

We demonstrate the potential of van der Waals magnets for spintronic
applications by reporting long-distance magnon spin transport in the
electrically insulating antiferromagnet chromium thiophosphate (CrPS$_4$) with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We inject and detect magnon spins
non-locally by Pt contacts and monitor the non-local resistance as a function
of an in-plane magnetic field up to 7 Tesla. We observe a non-local resistance
over distances up to at least a micron below the Neel temperature (T$_{\rm N}$
= 38 Kelvin) close to magnetic field strengths that saturate the sublattice
magnetizations.

A simple strain-rate viscoelasticity model of isotropic soft solid is
introduced. The constitutive equations account for finite strain,
incompressibility, material frame-indifference, nonlinear elasticity, and
viscous dissipation. A nonlinear viscous wave equation for the shear strain is
obtained exactly, and a corresponding one-way Burgers-type equation is derived
by making standard approximations. Analysis of the travelling wave solutions
shows that the two partial differential equations produce distinct solutions,
and that deviations are exacerbated when wave amplitudes are not arbitrarily
small. In the elastic limit, the one-way approximate wave equation can be
linked to simple wave theory, thus allowing direct error measurements.

We study the quantization of the excess charge on $N$ localized
(ultra-screened) impurities in $d$-dimensional crystalline insulating systems.
Solving Dyson's equation, we demonstrate that such charges are topological, by
expressing them as winding numbers of appropriate functionals of bulk position
space Green's functions. We discuss the ties of our topological invariant with
the nearsightedness principle of W. Kohn, stating that the electronic charge
density at fixed chemical potential depends on the external field only locally,
meaning that localized perturbations by external fields may only result in
localized charge redistributions. We arrive at the same conclusion by
demonstrating that an adiabatic perturbation comprised of a variation of
impurities' positions and/or strengths may only result in the change in the
occupancy of impurity-localized bound states sitting, energy-wise, close to the
Fermi level. Finally, we conclude by discussing the relations of the
nearsightedness principle with the topological invariants characterizing the
boundary charge.

Interaction-induced topological systems have attracted a growing interest for
their exotic properties going beyond the single-particle picture of topological
insulators. In particular, the interplay between strong correlations and finite
doping can give rise to nonhomogeneous solutions that break the translational
symmetry. In this work, we report the appearance of a topological stripe state
in an interaction-induced Chern insulator around half-filling. In contrast to
similar stripe phases in nontopological systems, here we observe the appearance
of chiral edge states on top of the domain wall. Furthermore, we characterize
their topological nature by analyzing the quantized transferred charge of the
domains in a pumping scheme. Finally, we focus on aspects relevant to observing
such phases in state-of-the-art quantum simulators of ultracold atoms in
optical lattices. In particular, we propose an adiabatic state preparation
protocol and a detection scheme of the topology of the system in real space.

We construct a general theory of adiabatic propagation of spinor
exciton-polaritons in waveguides of arbitrary shape, accounting for the effects
of TE-TM splitting in linear polarizations and Zeeman splitting in circular
polarizations. The developed theory is applied for the description of
waveguides of periodically curved shape. We show that in this geometry the
periodic rotation of the effective in-plane magnetic field produced by TE-TM
interaction results in a nontrivial band-gap structure, which can be
additionally tuned by application of an external magnetic field. It is also
demonstrated, that spin-dependent interactions between polaritons lead to the
formation of stable gap solitons.

Recently, Pei et al. (arXiv2105.13250) reported that ambient pressure
${\beta}$-MoB$_2$ exhibits a phase transition to ${\alpha}$-MoB$_2$ (space
group: $P6/mmm$) at pressure P~70 GPa and this high-pressure phase is a
high-temperature superconductor exhibited $T_c=32 K$ at P~110 GPa. Despite
${\alpha}$-MoB$_2$ has the same crystalline structure as ambient pressure
MgB$_2$2 and the $T_c$'s of ${\alpha}$-MoB$_2$ and MgB$_2$ are very close, the
first principles calculations showed that in ${\alpha}$-MoB$_2$ the states near
the Fermi level, ${\epsilon}_F$, are dominated by the $d$-electrons of Mo
atoms, while in MgB$_2$ the $p$-orbitals of boron atomic sheets dominantly
contribute to the states near the ${\epsilon}_F$. More recently, Hire et al.
(arXiv2212.14869) reported that the $P6/mmm$-phase can be stabilized at ambient
pressure in $Nb_{1-x}Mo_{x}B_{2}$ solid solutions, and these ternary alloys
exhibit $T_c=8 K$. In addition, Pei et al. (Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. 65,
287412 (2022)) showed that compressed WB$_2$ exhibits $T_c=15 K$ at P~121 GPa.
Here, we analyzed experimental data reported for $P6/mmm$-phases of
$Nb_{1-x}Mo_{x}B_{2}$ (x = 0.25; 1.0) and highly-compressed WB$_2$, and showed
that these three phases exhibit $d$-wave superconductivity. We also deduced the
gap-to-transition temperature ratio for these three phases. We found that
$Nb_{0.75}Mo_{0.25}B_{2}$ exhibits high strength of nonadiabaticity, which is
quantified by the ratio of $T_{\theta}/T_F=3.5$, which is by one order of
magnitude exceeds the ratio in MgB$_2$, ${\alpha}$-MoB$_2$, WB$_2$, pnictides,
cuprates, and highly-compressed hydrides.

Prediction of the electronic structure of functional materials is essential
for the engineering of new devices. Conventional electronic structure
prediction methods based on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from not
only high computational cost, but also limited accuracy arising from the
approximations of the exchange-correlation functional. Surrogate methods based
on machine learning have garnered much attention as a viable alternative to
bypass these limitations, especially in the prediction of solid-state band
gaps, which motivated this research study. Herein, we construct a random forest
regression model for band gaps of double perovskite materials, using a dataset
of 1306 band gaps computed with the GLLBSC (Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe,
and Baerends solid correlation) functional. Among the 20 physical features
employed, we find that the bulk modulus, superconductivity temperature, and
cation electronegativity exhibit the highest importance scores, consistent with
the physics of the underlying electronic structure. Using the top 10 features,
a model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained,
comparable to previous studies. Our results are significant in the sense that
they attest to the potential of machine learning regressions for the rapid
screening of promising candidate functional materials.

Electron correlation effects are ubiquitous in transition-metal compounds.
Here we identify a material platform that allows to map out correlations across
a whole group of the $d$ block, most importantly, for the same kind of leading
ground-state configuration and on the same type of crystalline lattice. The
wave-function analysis that we provide, in terms of either localized,
atomic-like or multisite orbitals, makes these materials $-$ the group-V
lacunar spinels $-$ a distinct correlated-electron model system. It also
defines the basic theoretical frame when addressing the different types of
skyrmionic phases and magneto-electric couplings in lacunar spinels.

The decay of luminescence emitted by an activated natural calcite sample
after being excited by longwave ultraviolet light (370 nm) has been measured
and analyzed. The time evolution of the light intensity did not follow a single
exponential decay. Rather, a distribution of decay-times was inferred via the
extraction of a fit parameter characterizing the nature of the observed
stretched exponential decay, herein referred to as the beta parameter. In
conjunction with the average wavelength of the emitted light as well as its
average decay-time, the beta parameter may serve as an important predictor of
the nature, concentration and spatial homogeneity of the activators (and
possible quenchers) within the calcite sample.

<h3>Inverting multiple quantum many-body scars via disorder</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The recent observations of persistent revivals in the Rydberg atom chain have
revealed a weak ergodicity breaking mechanism known as quantum many-body scars,
which is typically a collection of states with low entanglement embedded in
otherwise thermal spectra. Here, by applying a generic formalism, we propose a
direct evolution from the quantum many-body scars to their inverse case and
construct multiple inverted quantum many-body scars, i.e., different sets of
excited states with volume-law entanglement embedded in a sea of the many-body
localized spectrum. When increasing the disorder strength, a tower of exact
eigenstates remain intact, acting as conventional quantum many-body scars at
weak disorder, and each residing inside narrow energy windows with the emerged
inverted quantum many-body scar at strong disorder. Moreover, the strong
disorder also induces additional sets of inverted quantum many-body scars with
their energies concentrating in the middle of the exact eigenstates. As a
result, all the multiple inverted quantum many-body scars are approximately
equidistant in energy. We further examine the stability of the conventional and
the inverted quantum many-body scars against the external random field. Our
findings expand the variety of nonthermal systems and connect the weak
ergodicity breaking with the weak violation of many-body localization.

<h3>Charged domain walls in BaTiO$_3$ crystals emerging from superdomain  boundaries</h3>

<br>
<i>P. S. Bednyakov, J. Hlinka</i>
<br>
<br>
Previous experiments with BaTiO$_3$ single crystals have shown that
application of the electric field in the vicinity of the ferroelectric phase
transition can be used to introduce peculiar persisting ferroelectric domain
walls, accompanied by the compensating charge in the form of two-dimensional
electron gas. The present in-situ optical observations of such electric poling
process reveal formation of a transient coexistence of the cubic and
ferroelectric phases, the latter one being broken into multiple martensitic
superdomains, separated by superdomain walls. It is revealed that as the
transient superdomains convert into the regular ferroelectric domains, the
superdomain boundaries transform into the desired charged domain walls. In
order to assign the observed transient domain patterns, to understand the
shapes of the observed ferrolectric precipitates and their agglomerates as well
as to provide the overall interpretation of the observed domain formation
process, the implications of the mechanical compatibility of the coexisting
superdomain states is derived in the framework of the Wechsler-Lieberman-Read
theory. The results also suggest that the transport of the compensating charge
carriers towards the final charged domain wall location is directly associated
with the electric conductivity and interlinked motion and growth of the
superdomain walls and phase fronts.

The thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) by the interaction between high energy
electrons and phonon vibration has been re-investigated. The elastic scattering
potential of an oscillating atom conserves the scattering ability though the
vibration changes its spatial distribution. Moreover, the thermal scattered
electrons are also coherent to form the diffuse interference patterns under the
time-average assumption. Elastic and coherent TDS contributes most contrast in
Kikuchi lines.

Graphite is an interesting material for high temperature applications and
will likely become increasingly important as we attempt to electrify industrial
applications. However, high-quality graphite can be expensive, reducing the
cost-competitiveness of clean technologies. Here, we investigate the thermal
properties of low-quality, macro-porous graphite to determine the tradeoff
between cost and thermal performance. We use laser flash analysis (LFA) to
measure the thermal diffusivity of graphite at high temperatures. However, due
to the large pores in the graphite samples, we must apply a thick coating to
achieve the required flat, parallel surfaces for LFA measurements. The presence
of the coating directly impacts the measured diffusivity, not only due to the
thickness but also due to the sample/coating interface profile generated. We
therefore develop a methodology based on finite element modeling of a variety
of sample/coating interface profiles to extract properties of the sample.
Validating the methodology against a reference sample demonstrates a mean
absolute percentage error of 8.5%, with potential improvement with better
sample characterization. We show low-quality graphite has a thermal
conductivity of ~10 W/m/K up to 1000C, which is an order of magnitude lower
than high-quality graphite, but contributions from photon conductivity may
result in higher conductivities at higher temperatures. Overall, we demonstrate
an approach for measuring thermal properties of macro-porous materials at high
temperatures, and apply the approach to measuring thermal conductivity of
graphite, which will aid in the design of high-temperature systems for
cost-competitive decarbonization.

<br>

When transistor gate insulators have nanometer-scale equivalent oxide
thickness (EOT), the gate capacitance ($C_\textrm{G}$) becomes smaller than the
oxide capacitance ($C_\textrm{ox}$) due to the quantum capacitance and charge
centroid capacitance of the channel. Here, we study the capacitance of
monolayer MoS$_\textrm{2}$ as a prototypical two-dimensional (2D) channel while
considering spatial variations in the potential, charge density, and density of
states. At 0.5 nm EOT, the monolayer MoS$_\textrm{2}$ capacitance is smaller
than its quantum capacitance, limiting the single-gated $C_\textrm{G}$ of an
n-type channel to between 63% and 78% of $C_\textrm{ox}$ for gate overdrive
voltages between 0.5 and 1 V. Despite these limitations, for dual-gated
devices, the on-state $C_\textrm{G}$ of monolayer MoS$_\textrm{2}$ is 50%
greater than that of silicon at 0.5 nm EOT and more than three times that of
InGaAs at 1 nm EOT, indicating that 2D semiconductors are promising for
nanoscale devices at future technology nodes.

The study of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in clean, layered

the study of charge carrier dynamics in a novel 2-dimensional superconducting
van der Waals heterostructure comprising monolayer MoS2 and few-layer NbSe2 (15

superconducting transition in the system is percolative. We present a
phenomenological picture of different phases across the transition correlating
with the evaluated noise. The analysis of the higher-order statistics of
fluctuation reveals non-Gaussian components around the transition indicative of
long-range correlation in the system.

We introduce a method for quantum simulation of U$(1)$ lattice gauge theories
coupled to matter, utilizing alkaline-earth(-like) atoms in state-dependent
optical lattices. The proposal enables the study of both gauge and
fermionic-matter fields without integrating out one of them in one and two
dimensions. We focus on a realistic and robust implementation that utilizes the
long-lived metastable clock state available in alkaline-earth(-like) atomic
species. Starting from an $ab\,initio$ modelling of the experimental setting,
we systematically carry out a derivation of the target U$(1)$ gauge theory.
This approach allows us to identify and address conceptual and practical
challenges for the implementation of lattice gauge theories that - while
pivotal for a successful implementation - have never been rigorously addressed
in the literature: those include the specific engineering of lattice potentials
to achieve the desired structure of Wannier functions, and the subtleties
involved in realizing the proper separation of energy scales to enable
gauge-invariant dynamics. We discuss realistic experiments that can be carried
out within such a platform using the fermionic isotope $^{173}$Yb, addressing
via simulations all key sources of imperfections, and provide concrete
parameter estimates for relevant energy scales in both one- and two-dimensional
settings.

model adapter to the particular use case. As a model structure, we take well

demonstrate a dynamic way to control the optical polarization properties and
their evolution. The ability to control the optical properties of QDs is
important for the fabrication of future nano optical devices since QDs are
practical sources of single photons. In particular, the control over the energy

The atomic scale dynamics of halide perovskites have a direct impact not only
on their thermal stability but their optoelectronic properties. Progress in
machine learned potentials has only recently enabled modeling the finite
temperature behavior of these material using fully atomistic methods with near
first-principles accuracy. Here, we systematically analyze the impact of
heating and cooling rate, simulation size, model uncertainty, and the role of
the underlying exchange-correlation functional on the phase behavior of CsPbX3
with X=Cl, Br, and I, including both the perovskite and the delta-phases. We
show that rates below approximately 30 K/ns and system sizes of at least a few
ten thousand atoms are indicated to achieve convergence with regard to these
parameters. By controlling these factors and constructing models that are
specific for different exchange-correlation functionals we then show that the
semi-local functionals considered in this work (SCAN, vdW-DF-cx, PBEsol, and
PBE) systematically underestimate the transition temperatures separating the
perovskite phases while overestimating the lattice parameters. Among the
considered functionals the vdW-DF-cx functional yields the closest agreement
with experiment, followed by SCAN, PBEsol, and PBE. Our work provides
guidelines for the systematic analysis of dynamics and phase transitions in
inorganic halide perovskites and similar systems. It also serves as a benchmark
for the further development of machine-learned potentials as well as
exchange-correlation functionals.

Layered hybrid perovskites have attracted much attention in recent years due
to their emergent physical properties and exceptional functional performances,
but the coexistence of lattice order and structural disorder severely hinders
our understanding of these materials. One unsolved problem regards how the
lattice dynamics are affected by the dimensional engineering of the inorganic
frameworks and the interaction with the molecular moieties. Here, we address
this question by using a combination of high-resolution spontaneous Raman
scattering, high-field terahertz spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics
simulations. This approach enables us to reveal the structural vibrations and
disorder in and out of equilibrium and provides surprising observables that
differentiate single- and double-layered perovskites. While no distinct
vibrational coherence is observed in double-layer perovskites, we discover that
an off-resonant terahertz pulse can selectively drive a long-lived coherent
phonon mode through a two-photon process in the single-layered system. This
difference highlights the dramatic change in the lattice environment as the
dimension is reduced. The present findings pave the way for the ultrafast
structural engineering of hybrid lattices as well as for developing high-speed
optical modulators based on layered perovskites.

<br>
<br>
In stark contrast with the conventional understanding of the glass
transition, where the transition from glass to liquid appears as a dynamic
process where atoms/molecules cooperatively relax into the equilibrium phase,
we experimentally show that the nature of the glass transition depends at a
given temperature on the ratio between the relaxation time of the glass,
{\tau}_glass, taken as its transformation time, and the alpha relaxation time,
{\tau}_{\alpha}. Although the relaxation of liquid-cooled glasses is not
totally synchronous, due to the existence of a distribution of relaxation
times, there has been no clear observation of phase separation. However, at
temperatures at which {\tau}_glass/{\tau}_{\alpha} is large, high mobility
regions nucleate into the liquid phase that subsequently grow by dynamic
facilitation before, or while, cooperative glass relaxation sets into play. On
the contrary, at temperatures associated to smaller
{\tau}_glass/{\tau}_{\alpha} the glass transition proceeds by cooperative
relaxation dynamics all across the material. This behavior is independent of
the experimental procedure or protocol to produce the glass.

We theoretically investigate the spectral properties of a quantum impurity
(QI) hosting the here proposed Majorana-Ising-type quasiparticle (MIQ). It
arises from the coupling between a finite topological superconducor (TSC) based
on a chain of magnetic adatoms-superconducting hybrid system and an integer
large spin $S$ flanking the QI. Noteworthy, the spin $S$ couples to the QI via
the Ising-type exchange interaction. As the TSC chain contains overlapped
Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) at the edges, we counterintuitively find a regime
wherein the Ising term modulates the isolation of a fractionalized and resonant
MZM at the QI site. Interestingly enough, the fermionic nature of this state is
revealed as purely of electron tunneling-type and most astonishingly, it
completely ignores the Andreev reflection process in its birth. We find that an
isolated edge state appears as a zero-mode in a finite TSC and hope that it
could be used in majorana-based quantum computing.

It is well known that phonons can overscreen the bare Coulomb
electron-electron repulsion, turning it into the effective attraction that
binds the Cooper pairs responsible for BCS superconductivity. Here, we use a
simple lattice model to prove that the counterpart of this is also possible,
whereby phonons overscreen the bare electron-hole attraction and may turn it
repulsive at short distances, driving exciton dissociation in certain regions
of the parameter space. We argue that this phonon-mediated short-range
screening plays an important role in the physics of organic solar cell
materials (and other materials with strong electron-phonon coupling) and could
point the way to new strategies for optimizing their efficiencies.

This work considers the confining and scattering phenomena of electrons in a
Lieb lattice subjected to the influence of a rectangular electrostatic barrier.
In this setup, hopping amplitudes between nearest neighbors in orthogonal
directions are considered different, and the next-nearest neighbor interaction
describes spin-orbit coupling. This makes it possible to confine electrons and
generate bound states, the exact number of which is exactly determined for null
parallel momentum to the barrier. In such a case, it is proved that one even
and one odd bound state is always generated, and the number of bound states
increases for non-null and increasing values of the parallel momentum. That is,
bound states carry current. In the scattering regime, the exact values of
energy are determined where the resonant tunneling occurs. The existence of
perfect tunneling energy in the form of super-Klein tunneling is proved to
exist regardless of the bang gap opening. Finally, it is shown that perfect
reflection appears when solutions are coupled to the intermediate flat-band
solution.

We present a study of the principal deuterium Hugoniot for pressures up to
$150$ GPa, using Machine Learning potentials (MLPs) trained with Quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) energies, forces and pressures. In particular, we adopted a
recently proposed workflow based on the combination of Gaussian kernel
regression and $\Delta$-learning. By fully taking advantage of this method, we
explicitly considered finite-temperature electrons in the dynamics, whose
effects are highly relevant for temperatures above $10$ kK. The Hugoniot curve
obtained by our MLPs shows an excellent agreement with the most recent
experiments, with an accuracy comparable to the best DFT functionals. Our work
demonstrates that QMC can be successfully combined with $\Delta$-learning to
deploy reliable MLPs for complex extended systems across different
thermodynamic conditions, by keeping the QMC precision at the computational
cost of a mean-field calculation.

By performing experimental and model studies of a triangular-lattice dipolar
magnet KBaGd(BO$_3$)$_2$ (KBGB), we find the highly frustrated magnet with a
planar anisotropy hosts a strongly fluctuating dipolar spin liquid (DSL)
originating from the intriguing interplay between dipolar and Heisenberg
interactions. The DSL constitutes an extended regime in the field-temperature
phase diagram, which gets narrowed in temperature range as field increases and
eventually ends with a quantum critical point (QCP) at $B_c\simeq 0.75$ T.
Based on dipolar Heisenberg model calculations, we identify the DSL as a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase. Due to the tremendous entropy
accumulation that can be related to the strong BKT and quantum fluctuations,
unprecedented magnetic cooling effects are observed in the DSL regime and
particularly near the QCP, making KBGB a superior dipolar coolant over
commercial Gd-based refrigerants. We establish a universal phase diagram for
triangular-lattice dipolar quantum magnets where emergent symmetry plays an
essential role, and lay down foundations for their applications in sub-Kelvin
refrigeration.

The transport properties of gapless edge modes at boundaries between
topologically distinct domains are of fundamental and technological importance.
Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of topological edge
states and their response to interparticle interactions. Here, we
experimentally study long-distance quantised Hall drifts in a harmonically
confined topological pump of non-interacting and interacting ultracold
fermionic atoms. We find that quantised drifts halt and reverse their direction
when the atoms reach a critical slope of the confining potential, revealing the
presence of a topological boundary. The drift reversal corresponds to a band
transfer between a band with Chern number $C = +1$ and a band with $C = -1$ via
a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for
non-interacting particles. We establish that a non-zero repulsive Hubbard
interaction leads to the emergence of an additional edge in the system, relying
on a purely interaction-induced mechanism, in which pairs of fermions are
split.
