<h3>An exact model for the transition to collective motion in nonreciprocal  active matter</h3>

Two hallmarks of non-equilibrium systems, from active colloids to animal
herds, are agents motility and nonreciprocal interactions. Their interplay
creates feedback loops that lead to complex spatiotemporal dynamics crucial to
understand and control the non-linear response of active systems. Here, we
introduce a minimal model that captures these two features at the microscopic
scale, while admitting an exact hydrodynamic theory valid also in the
fully-nonlinear regime. We applied statistical mechanics techniques to exactly
coarse-grain the microscopic model and used dynamical systems insights to
analyze the resulting equations. In the absence of motility, we find two
transitions to oscillatory phases occurring via distinct mechanisms: a Hopf
bifurcation and a Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC) bifurcation. In the
presence of motility, this rigorous approach, complemented by numerical
simulations, allows us to quantitatively assess the hitherto neglected impact
of inter-species nonreciprocity on a paradigmatic transition in active matter:
the emergence of collective motion. When nonreciprocity is weak, we show that
flocking is accelerated and bands tend to synchronize with a spatial overlap
controlled by nonlinearities. When nonreciprocity is strong, flocking is
superseded by a Chase & Rest dynamical phase where each species alternates
between a chasing state, when they propagate, and a resting state, when they
stand still. Phenomenological models with linear non-reciprocal couplings fail
to predict this Chase & Rest phase which illustrates the usefulness of our
exact coarse-graining procedure.

<h3>The electrostatic fate of $N$-layer moiré graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07531</a>
<br>
<i>Kryštof Kolář, Yiran Zhang, Stevan Nadj-Perge, Felix von Oppen, Cyprian Lewandowski</i>
<br>
<br>
Twisted $N$-layer graphene (TNG) moir\'e structures have recently been shown
to exhibit robust superconductivity similar to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG).
In particular for $N=4$ and $N=5$, the phase diagram features a superconducting
pocket that extends beyond the nominal full filling of the flat band. These
observations are seemingly at odds with the canonical understanding of the
low-energy theory of TNG, wherein the TNG Hamiltonian consists of one flat-band
sector and accompanying dispersive bands. Using a self-consistent Hartee-Fock
treatment, we explain how the phenomenology of TNG can be understood through an
interplay of in-plane Hartree and inhomogeneous layer potentials, which cause a
reshuffling of electronic bands. We extend our understanding beyond the case of
N = 5 realized in experiment so far. We decribe how the Hartree and layer
potentials control the phase diagram for devices with N $>$ 5 and tend to
preclude exchange-driven correlated phenomena in this limit. To circumvent
these electrostatic constraints, we propose a new flat-band paradigm that could
be realized in large-N devices by taking advantage of two nearly flat sectors
acting together to enhance the importance of exchange effects.

<h3>Anisotropic thermo-mechanical response of layered hexagonal boron  nitride and black phosphorus: application as a simultaneous pressure and  temperature sensor</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and black phosphorus (bP) are crystalline
materials that can be seen as ordered stackings of two-dimensional layers,
which lead to outstanding anisotropic physical properties. The knowledge of the
thermal equations of state of hBN and bP is of great interest in the field of
2D materials for a better understanding of the anisotropic thermo-mechanical
properties and exfoliation mechanism of these materials. Despite several
theoretical and experimental studies, important uncertainties remain in the
determination of the thermoelastic parameters of hBN and bP. Here, we report
accurate thermal expansion and compressibility measurements along the
individual crystallographic axes, using in situ high-temperature and
high-pressure high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. In particular, we
have quantitatively determined the subtle variations of the in-plane
thermo-mechanical parameters by subjecting these materials to hydrostatic
pressure conditions and collecting a large number of data points in small
pressure and temperature increments. Based on the anisotropic behavior of bP,
we propose the use of this material as sensor for the simultaneous
determination of pressure and temperature in the range 0-5 GPa, 298-1700 K.

<br>
<br>
Recent experiments have employed rapidly expanding toroidal Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) to mimic the inflationary expansion in the early universe.
One expected signature of the expansion in such experiments is spontaneous
particle creation (of phonons) which is observable in density-density
correlations. We study entanglement of these particles, which are known to
result in a two-mode squeezed state. Using techniques for Gaussian states of
continuous variable systems, we quantify the entanglement generated in this
system, including effects such as decoherence and the use of an initially
squeezed state, which can suppress and enhance entanglement, respectively. We
also describe a protocol to experimentally measure the correlations entering
the covariance matrix, allowing an experimental quantification of the
entanglement properties of the inflationary BEC.

Superconductors are materials with zero electrical resistivity and the
ability to expel magnetic fields known as the Meissner effect. Their
dissipationless diamagnetic response is central to magnetic levitation and
circuits such as quantum interference devices. Here, we use superconducting
diamagnetism to shape the magnetic environment governing the transport of spin
waves - collective spin excitations in magnets that are promising on-chip
signal carriers - in a thin-film magnet. Using diamond-based magnetic imaging,
we observe hybridized spin-wave-Meissner-current transport modes with strongly
altered, temperature-tunable wavelengths. We extract the temperature-dependent
London penetration depth from the wavelength shifts and realize local control
of spin-wave refraction using a focused laser. Our results demonstrate the
versatility of superconductor-manipulated spin-wave transport and have
potential applications in spin-wave gratings, filters, crystals and cavities.

This study investigates the use of machine learning (ML) to correct the
enthalpy of formation (Hf) from two separate DFT functionals, PBE and SCAN, to
the experimental Hf across 1011 solid-state compounds. The ML model uses a set
of 25 properties that characterize the electronic structure as calculated using
PBE and SCAN. The ML model significantly decreases the error in PBE-calculated
Hf values from an mean absolute error (MAE) of 195 meV/atom to an MAE = 80
meV/atom when compared to the experiment. For PBE, the PDP+GAM analysis shows
compounds with a high ionicity (I), i.e., I>0.22, have errors in Hf that are
twice as large as compounds having I < 0.22 (246 meV/atom compared to 113
meV/atom). Conversely, no analogous trend is observed for SCAN-calculated Hfs,
which explains why the ML model for PBE can more easily correct the systematic
error in calculated Hfs for PBE but not for SCAN. Although the literature
suggests PBE is reliable for intermetallics but less so for oxides and halides,
our analysis reveals intermetallics pose a challenge for PBE only when the
charge transfer is significant (I >0.22). Meanwhile, oxides and halides may be
described accurately by PBE for systems in which charge transfer is relatively
low (I < 0.22).

<h3>Avalanche Instability as Nonequilibrium Quantum Criticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07612" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07612</a>
<br>
<i>Xi Chen, Jong E. Han</i>
<br>
<br>
A fundamental instability in the nonequilibrium conduction band under a
electric field bias is proposed via the spontaneous emission of coherent
phonons. Analytic theory, supported by numerical calculations, establishes that
the quantum avalanche, an abrupt nonequilibrium occupation of excited bands,
results from the competition between the collapse of the band minimum via the
phonon emission and the dephasing of the electron with the environment. The
continuous avalanche transition is a quantum phase transition with the
nonequilibrium phase diagram determined by the avalanche parameter $\beta$,
with peculiar reentrant avalanche domes close to the phase boundary. We further
confirm the nature of the quantum avalanche with the temperature dependence.

<h3>Phases and Exotic Phase Transitions of a Two-Dimensional  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07613" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07613</a>
<br>
<i>Anika Götz, Martin Hohenadler, Fakher F. Assaad</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by
means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a
symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at
the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time
correlations. Using single-spin-flip updates, we investigate the phase diagram
at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency
$\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson-assisted, the model maps
onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the
emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the
assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime
can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our
results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence
bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing
$\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature
signatures of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a
nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.

<h3>Strain engineering of Zeeman and Rashba effects in transition metal  dichalcogenide nanotubes and their Janus variants: An ab initio study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07616" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07616</a>
<br>
<i>Arpit Bhardwaj, Phanish Suryanarayana</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the influence of mechanical deformations on the Zeeman and Rashba
effects in synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanotubes and
their Janus variants from first principles. In particular, we perform
symmetry-adapted density functional theory simulations with spin-orbit coupling
to determine the variation in the Zeeman and Rashba splittings with axial and
torsional deformations. We find significant splitting in molybdenum and
tungsten nanotubes, for which the Zeeman splitting decreases with increase in
strain, going to zero for large enough tensile/shear strains, while the Rashba
splitting coefficient increases linearly with shear strain, while being zero
for all tensile strains, a consequence of the inversion symmetry remaining
unbroken. In addition, the Zeeman splitting is relatively unaffected by
nanotube diameter, whereas the Rashba coefficient decreases with increase in
diameter. Overall, mechanical deformations represent a powerful tool for
spintronics in TMD nanotubes as well as their Janus variants.

<h3>Unveiling phase diagram of the lightly doped high-Tc cuprate  superconductors with disorder removed</h3>

<br>
<br>
The currently established electronic phase diagram of cuprates is based on a
study of single- and double-layered compounds. These CuO2 planes, however, are
directly contacted with dopant layers, thus inevitably disordered with an
inhomogeneous electronic state. Here, we solve this issue by investigating a
6-layered Ba2Ca5Cu6O12(F,O)2 with inner CuO2 layers, which are clean with the
extremely low disorder, by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
and quantum oscillation measurements. We find a tiny Fermi pocket with a doping
level less than 1 % to exhibit well-defined quasiparticle peaks which
surprisingly lack the polaronic feature. This provides the first evidence that
the slightest amount of carriers is enough to turn a Mott insulating state into
a metallic state with long-lived quasiparticles. By tuning hole carriers, we
also find an unexpected phase transition from the superconducting to metallic
states at 4 %. Our results are distinct from the nodal liquid state with
polaronic features proposed as an anomaly of the heavily underdoped cuprates.

<h3>Non-Gaussian fluctuations of a probe coupled to a Gaussian field</h3>

<br>
<br>
The motion of a colloidal probe in a complex fluid, such as a micellar
solution, is usually described by the generalized Langevin equation, which is
linear. However, recent numerical simulations and experiments have shown that
this linear model fails when the probe is confined, and that the intrinsic
dynamics of the probe is actually non-linear. Noting that the kurtosis of the
displacement of the probe may reveal the non-linearity of its dynamics also in
the absence confinement, we compute it for a probe coupled to a Gaussian field
and possibly trapped by a harmonic potential. We show that the excess kurtosis
increases from zero at short times, reaches a maximum, and then decays
algebraically at long times, with an exponent which depends on the spatial
dimensionality and on the features and correlations of the dynamics of the
field. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the
stochastic dynamics of the probe and the field where the latter is represented
by a finite number of modes.

<h3>Improved Single-Shot Qubit Readout Using Twin RF-SET Charge Correlations</h3>

<br>
<br>
High fidelity qubit readout is critical in order to obtain the thresholds
needed to implement quantum error correction protocols and achieve
fault-tolerant quantum computing. Large-scale silicon qubit devices will have
densely-packed arrays of quantum dots with multiple charge sensors that are, on
average, farther away from the quantum dots, entailing a reduction in readout
fidelities. Here, we present a readout technique that enhances the readout
fidelity in a linear SiMOS 4-dot array by amplifying correlations between a
pair of single-electron transistors, known as a twin SET. By recording and
subsequently correlating the twin SET traces as we modulate the dot detuning
across a charge transition, we demonstrate a reduction in the charge readout
infidelity by over one order of magnitude compared to traditional readout
methods. We also study the spin-to-charge conversion errors introduced by the
modulation technique, and conclude that faster modulation frequencies avoid
relaxation-induced errors without introducing significant spin flip errors,
favouring the use of the technique at short integration times. This method not
only allows for faster and higher fidelity qubit measurements, but it also
enhances the signal corresponding to charge transitions that take place farther
away from the sensors, enabling a way to circumvent the reduction in readout
fidelities in large arrays of qubits.

<h3>Exploring the Impact of Configurational Entropy on the Design and  Development of CoNi-Based Superalloys for Sustainable Applications</h3>

<br>
<br>
A comprehensive literature review on recently rediscovered Co- and/or
CoNi-based superalloys, strengthened by the {\gamma}' phase, revealed a
relationship between the configurational entropy of the system and the
{\gamma}' solvus temperature. This study was conducted on a high Cr CoNi-based
superalloy system with high configurational entropy to test our hypothesis
based on the sustainable metallurgy framework. Thermodynamic calculations were
performed to design the chemical compositions, followed by vacuum casting and
heat treatments to produce the desired alloys. The microstructures were
characterized using a scanning electron microscope, electron backscattered
diffraction, transmission electron microscope, and differential thermal
analysis. Microhardness and nanoindentation tests were employed to measure the
mechanical properties. The results showed that both the configurational entropy
and the type of alloying elements determine the final high-temperature
performance of the alloys. We found that to enhance the higher {\gamma}' solvus
temperature, the configurational entropy should be increased by adding
{\gamma}' stabilizing elements. The microstructural and mechanical
characteristics of the designed alloys before and after heat treatments are
discussed in detail. The outcome of this study is beneficial for developing
cobalt-based high-entropy superalloys with appropriate processing windows and
freezing ranges for advanced sustainable manufacturing purposes, such as using
powder bed fusion technologies.

<h3>Doubly screened Coulomb correction approach for strongly correlated  systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Strongly correlated systems containing d/f-electrons present a challenge to
conventional density functional theory (DFT), such as the widely used local
density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradient approximation (GGA). In
this work, we developed a doubly screened Coulomb correction (DSCC) approach to
perform on-site Coulomb interaction correction for strongly correlated
materials. The on-site Coulomb interaction between localized d/f-electrons is
determined from a model dielectric function that includes both the static
dielectric and the Thomas-Fermi screening. All parameters of the dielectric
model are efficiently obtained from self-consistent calculations. We applied
DSCC to simulate the electronic and magnetic properties of typical 3d, 4f and
5f strongly correlated systems. The results show that the accuracy of DSCC is
comparable to hybrid functionals, but an order of magnitude faster. In
addition, DSCC can reflect the difference in the Coulomb interaction of the
same element between metallic and insulating situations, similar to the popular
but computationally expensive constrained random phase approximation (cRPA)
approach. This feature suggests that DSCC is also a promising method for
simulating Coulomb interaction parameters.

<h3>Switching current distributions in ferromagnetic anomalous Josephson  junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the switching current distributions of ferromagnetic anomalous
Josephson junctions subjected to a linearly increasing bias current. Our study
uncovers a significant correlation between the position of the switching
current distributions and crucial system parameters, such as the strength of
the spin-orbit coupling and the Gilbert damping parameter. This indicates that
these parameters can be directly determined through experimental measurements.
By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the interplay among noise,
magnetization, phase dynamics, and the statistical properties of the switching
current distribution, we deepen our understanding of these intriguing cryogenic
spintronics devices. These findings hold potential for applications in the
field of quantum computing architectures and information processing
technologies.

<br>
<br>
Synthetic two-dimensional (2D) mono-elemental crystals, namely X-enes, have
recently emerged as a new frontier for atomically thin nanomaterials with
on-demand properties. Among X-enes, antimonene, the \b{eta}-phase allotrope of
antimony, is formed by atoms arranged in buckled hexagonal rings bearing a
comparatively higher environmental stability with respect to other players of
this kind. However, the exploitation of monolayer or few-layer antimonene and
other 2D materials in novel opto-electronic devices is still hurdled by the
lack of scalable processes. Here, we demonstrated the viability of a bottom-up
process for the epitaxial growth of antimonene-like nanocrystals (ANCs), based
on a Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) process, assisted by gold
nanoparticles (Au NPs) on commensurate (111)-terminated Ge surfaces. The growth
mechanism was investigated by large- and local-area microstructural analysis,
revealing that the etching of germanium, catalyzed by the Au NPs, led to the
ANCs growth on the exposed Ge (111) planes. As a supportive picture, ab-initio
calculations rationalized this epitaxial relationship in terms of compressively
strained \b{eta}-phase ANCs. Our process could pave the way to the realization
of large-area antimonene layers by a deposition process compatible with the
current semiconductor manufacturing technology.

<h3>Buckling effects in AlN monolayers: Shifting and enhancing optical  characteristics\break from the UV to the near visible light range</h3>

<br>
<br>
The structural, electronic, and optical properties of flat and buckled AlN
monolayers are investigated using first-principles approaches. The band gap of
a flat AlN monolayer is changed from an indirect one to a direct one, when the
planar buckling increases, primarily due to diminishing sp$^2$ overlapping and
bond symmetry breaking in the conversion to sp$^3$ bonds. The sp$^3$
hybridization thus results in a stronger $\sigma\text{-}\pi$ bond rather than a
$\sigma\text{-}\sigma$ covalent bond. The calculations of the phonon band
structure indicates that the buckled AlN monolayers are structurally and
dynamically stable. The optical properties, such as the dielectric function,
the refractive index, and the optical conductivity of an AlN monolayer are
evaluated for both flat systems and those impacted with planar buckling. The
flat AlN monolayer has outstanding optical characteristics in the Deep-UV and
absorbs more effectively in the UV spectrum due to its large band gap. The
results reveal that optical aspects are enhanced along different directions of
light polarization, with a considerable shift in the optical spectrum from
Deep-UV into the visible range. Additionally, depending on the polarization
direction of the incoming light, increased planar buckling enhances the optical
conductivity in both the visible and the Deep-UV domains. The ability to modify
the optical and electronic properties of these essential 2D materials using
planar buckling technique opens up new technological possibilities,
particularly for optoelectronic devices.

In this reply, we include new experimental results and verify that the
observed non-linearity in rippled-MoS2 (leading to mobility kink) is an
intrinsic property of a disordered system, rather than contact effects
(invasive probes) or other device issues. Noting that Wu's model is based on a
highly ordered ideal system, transfer curves are expected to be linear, and the
carrier density is assumed be constant. Wu's model is therefore oversimplified
for disordered systems and neglects carrier-density dependent scattering
physics. Thus, it is fundamentally incompatible with our rippled-MoS2, and
leads to the wrong conclusion.

<h3>Planar buckling controlled optical conductivity of SiC monolayer from  Deep-UV to visible light region: A first-principles study</h3>

The electrical and optical properties of flat and planar buckled siligraphene
(SiC) monolayer are examined using a first principles approach. Buckling
between the Si and the C atoms in SiC structures influences and impacts the
properties of the 2D nanomaterial, according to our results. The electron
density of a planar SiC monolayer is calculated, as well as the effects of
buckling on it. According to our findings, a siligraphene monolayer is a
semiconductor nanomaterial with a direct electronic band gap that decreases as
the planar buckling rises. The contributions to the density of states differ
owing to changes in the system's structure. Another explanation is that planar
buckling reduces the sp$^2$ overlapping, breaking the bond symmetry causing it
to become a sp$^3$ bond. We show that increased planar buckling between the Si
and the C atoms alters the monolayer's optical, mechanical, and thermal
properties. A managed planar buckling increases the optical conductivity with a
significant shift in the far visible range, as all optical spectra features are
red shifted, still remaining visible. Instead of a $\sigma\text{-}\sigma$
covalent bond, the sp$^3$ hybridization produces a stronger $\sigma\text{-}\pi$
bond. Optical characteristics such as the dielectric function, the absorbance,
and the optical conductivity of a SiC monolayer are investigated for both
parallel and perpendicular polarization of the incoming electric field for both
flat and planar buckled systems. The findings show that the optical properties
are influenced for both of these two polarizations, with a significant change
in the optical spectrum from the near visible to the far visible. The ability
to manipulate the optical and electrical characteristics of this critical 2D
material through planar buckling opens up new technological possibilities,
especially for optoelectronic devices.

Antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals with spin chirality offer excellent
platforms to address the Berry phase physics, which manifests prominently in
several of their electro-optical and electro-magnetic responses including as a
large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and spin Hall conductivity. Here, we report
measurements of magneto-transport in c-axis textured Mn3Sn thin films grown on
the [111] plane of single crystal MgO. At room temperature, these films display
a weak uncompensated magnetic moment of \approx 0.12 \micro_{B}/f.u. in the
basal plane and a longitudinal resistivity (\rho_{xx}) close to \approx 3.8
\micro\Omega.m. A residual resistivity ration (\rho_{xx} (300 K)/\rho_{xx} (2
K)) of \approx 3.92 further indicates the high quality of the films. While at
300 K a weak AHE together with field-linear Hall resistivity (\rho_{xy}) is
observed in magnetic fields (H) applied perpendicular to the Kagome planes, the
temperature (T) dependence of \rho_{xy} shows prominent signatures of three
magnetic phases in the temperature regime of 2 to 300 K. The \rho_{xy} also
derives a non-trivial topological contribution (\r{ho}THE \approx 1n\Omega.m)
in the spin glass phase which appears at T \geq 100 K. Our measurements of
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and planar Hall effect (PHE) over a wide
H-T phase space reveal the hitherto unseen effects in the three magnetic phases
of Mn3Sn. While the AMR and PHE are negative in the inverse triangular spin
phase (250 K \geq T \geq TN), the helical phase (100 \geq T \geq 250 K) is
devoid of anisotropic in-plane resistivity, and the spin glass phase shows a
sign reversal of AMR with the increasing magnetic field. The origin of this
sign change in AMR/PHE is attributed to the emergence of topologically
protected spin textures like skyrmions where the fictitious effective magnetic
field is estimated to be \approx 4.4 tesla.

The general covariant Fokker-Planck equations associated with the two
different versions of covariant Langevin equation in Part I of this series of
work are derived, both lead to the same reduced Fokker-Planck equation for the
non-normalized one particle distribution function (1PDF). The relationship
between various distribution functions is clarified in this process. Several
macroscopic quantities are introduced by use of the 1PDF, and the results
indicate an intimate connection with the description in relativistic kinetic
theory. The concept of relativistic equilibrium state of the heat reservoir is
also clarified, and, under the working assumption that the Brownian particle
should approach the same equilibrium distribution as the heat reservoir in the
long time limit, a general covariant version of Einstein relation arises.

Density profiles are investigated arising in a critical Ising model in two
dimensions which is confined to a rectangular domain with uniform or mixed
boundary conditions and arbitrary aspect ratio. For the cases in which the two
vertical sides of the rectangle have up-spin boundary conditions + and the two
horizontal sides with either down-spin boundary conditions $-$ or with
free-spin boundary conditions $f$, exact results are presented for the density
profiles of the energy and the order parameter which display a surprisingly
rich behavior. The new results follow by means of conformal transformations
from known results in the half plane with $+-+-+$ and $+f+f+$ boundary
conditions. The corners with mixed boundary conditions lead to interesting
behavior, even in the limit of a half-infinite strip. The behavior near these
corners can be described by a ``Corner-Operator-Expansion'', which is discussed
in the second part of the paper. The analytic predictions agree very well with
simulations, with no adjustable parameters.

The lattice Hamiltonian with the presence of isotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) in a chiral magnetic on a square and hexagonal lattice is
numerically solved to provide full phase diagrams featuring skyrmions and
merons in various parameter planes. The whole regions of asymmetric skyrmions
and merons, which are lacking in analytical calculations and significantly
larger than the regions of symmetric skyrmions and merons, are present in the
phase diagrams. The transition I found between the meron or spin spiral and the
skyrmion with the magnetic field has already been observed in
experiments\cite{Yu2010,Herve2018,Iwasaki2013,Yu2018}. Finally, I demonstrate
the phase diagram for the $C_{nv}$ symmetric system with anisotropic DMI and
noticed that the anisotropy DMI's strength constantly changes the direction of
spin spiral propagation. Most crucially, I found a thermodynamically stable
antiskyrmion phase in the $C_{nv}$ symmetric system, which has been observed
experimentally \cite{Hoffmann2017}.

We consider Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to the action of
spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) periodically modulated in the radial direction. In
contrast to the commonly known principle that periodic potentials do not create
bound states, the binary BEC maintains multiple localized modes in the linear
limit, with their chemical potential falling into spectral gaps of the
(numerically found) radial band structure induced by the spatial modulation of
the SOC. In the presence of the repulsive nonlinearity, the SOC modulation
supports fundamental gap solitons of the semi-vortex types, as well as
higher-order vortex gap solitons. The localization degree and stability of the
gap solitons strongly depend on the location of their chemical potential in the
gap. Stability intervals for vortex gap solitons in a broad range of the
intrinsic vorticity, from -2 to 3, are identified. Thus, the analysis reveals
the previously unexplored mechanism of linear and nonlinear localization
provided by the spatially periodic modulation of SOC, which may be extended to
other settings, such as those for optical beams and polaritons. Unlike the
commonly known quartets of eigenvalues for small perturbations, in the present
system the instability is accounted for by shifted complex eigenvalue pairs.

We present a method for computing locally varying nonlinear mechanical
properties in particle simulations of amorphous solids. Plastic rearrangements
outside a probed region are suppressed by introducing an external field that
directly penalizes large nonaffine displacements. With increasing strength of
the field, plastic deformation can be localized. We characterize the
distribution of local plastic yield stresses (residual local stresses to
instability) with our approach, and assess the correlation of their spatial
maps with plastic activity in a model two-dimensional amorphous solid. Our
approach reduces artefacts inherent in a previous method known as the "frozen
matrix" approach that enforces fully affine deformation, and improves the
prediction of plastic rearrangements from structural information.

In recent experiments on conductance of one-dimensional (1D) channels in
ultra-clean samples, a diverse set of plateaus were found at fractions of the
quantum of conductance in zero magnetic field. We consider a discrete model of
strongly interacting electrons in a clean 1D system where the current between
weak tunneling contacts is carried by fractionally charged solutions. While in
the spinless case conductance remains unaffected by the interaction, as is
typical for the strongly interacting clean 1D systems, we demonstrate that in
the spinful case the peak conductance takes fractional values that depend on
the filling factor of the 1D channel.

<h3>Ab initio studies of the impact of the Debye-Waller factor on the  structural and dynamical properties of amorphous semiconductors: The case of  $a$-Si</h3>

<i>Devilal Dahal, Raymond Atta-Fynn, Stephen R. Elliott, Parthapratim Biswas</i>

<br>
This paper presents a first-principles study of the Debye-Waller factor and
the Debye temperature for amorphous silicon ($a$-Si) from lattice-dynamical
calculations and direct molecular-dynamics simulations using density-functional
theory (DFT). The effects of temperature and structural disorder on the
intensity of the diffraction maxima and the vibrational mean-square
displacement (MSD) of Si atoms are studied in the harmonic approximation, with
particular emphasis on the bond-length disorder, the presence of coordination
defects, and microvoids in $a$-Si networks. It has been observed that the MSDs
associated with tetrahedrally-bonded Si atoms are considerably lower than their
dangling-bond counterparts -- originating from isolated and vacancy-induced
clustered defects -- and those on the surface of microvoids, leading to an
asymmetric non-gaussian tail in the distribution of atomic displacements. An
examination of the effect of anharmonicity on the MSD at high temperatures
using direct $ab$ $initio$ molecular-dynamics simulations (without the harmonic
approximation) suggests that the vibrational motion in $a$-Si is practically
unaffected by anharmonic effects at temperatures below 400 K, as far as the
present DFT calculations are concerned. The Debye temperature of $a$-Si is
found to be in the range of 488--541 K from specific-heat and MSD calculations
using first-principles lattice-dynamical calculations in the harmonic
approximation, which matches closely with the experimental value of 487--528 K
obtained from specific-heat measurements of $a$-Si at low temperatures.

<h3>Electromagnetic Response of Disordered Superconducting Cavities</h3>

We present results for the resonant frequency shift and quality factor of
disordered Nb SRF cavities driven out of equilibrium by the resonant microwave
field. The theory is based on the nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity
for the current response to the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-metal
interface. We are able to accurately predict the observed frequency shifts with
a precision of order several Hz over the full temperature range $0 < T \le
T_c$, including the negative frequency shift anomalies that are observed very
near $T_c$. The origin of these anomalies is shown to be the competition
between the normal metal skin depth and the London penetration depth which
diverges as $T\rightarrow T_c^-$. An analytic approximation to the full current
response, valid for $|T-T_c|\ll T_c$, accounts for the negative frequency shift
near $T_c$. The non-monotonic dependence of the quality factor on the
quasiparticle scattering rate is related to the pair-breaking effect of
disorder on the superfluid fraction, and thus the London penetration depth.

Electron optics deals with condensed matter platforms for manipulating and
guiding electron beams with high efficiency and robustness. Common devices rely
on the spatial confinement of the electrons into one-dimensional (1D) channels.
Recently, there is growing interest in electron optics applications in two
dimensions, which heretofore are almost exclusively based on graphene devices.
In this work, we study band-inverted systems resulting from particle-hole
hybridization and demonstrate their potential for electron optics applications.
We develop the theory of interface scattering in an inverted-band $pn$ junction
using a scattering matrix formalism and observe negative refraction conditions
as well as transmission filtering akin to graphene's Klein tunneling but at
finite angles. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive protocol for
constructing electron optic components, such as focusing and bifurcating
lenses, polarizers, and mirrors. We numerically test the robustness of our
designs to disorder and finite temperatures, and motivate the feasibility of
experimental realization. Our work opens avenues for electron optics in two
dimensions beyond graphene-based devices, where a plethora of inverted-band
materials in contemporary experiments can be harnessed.

<h3>Pairing-dependent particle separation in non-Hermitian fermionic systems</h3>

<i>Yi Qin, Linhu Li</i>
<br>
<br>
We unveil an exotic phenomena originated in the intricate interplay between
non-Hermiticity and many-body interactions, namely an pairing-dependent
particle separation in a one-dimensional fermionic system driven by
spin-dependent non-Hermitian pumping. Specifically, a strong spin flipping term
reverses the direction of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) of the system in the
single-particle level, yet spin-paired fermions occupying the same lattice site
forbid spin flipping and hence exhibit non-reversed NHSE, and are thus
separated from unpaired ones. By turning on the Hubbard interaction, many-body
eigenstates split in their real energies, forming separable clusters in the
complex energy plane with either left-, right-, or bipolar-NHSE. The dependency
of skin accumulating directions on particle occupation is further justified
through analyzing local spin correlation and entanglement entropy of
corresponding many-body eigenstates. This occupation-dependent NHSE also
manifests as uni- or bi-directional pumping in many-body dynamics, providing a
mechanism for spatially separating paired and unpaired particles. Our work
unveils the possibility of designing and exploring novel non-Hermitian phases
originated from non-conserved particle species and their spatial
configurations.

We study an incommensurate XXZ spin chain coupled to a collection of local
harmonic baths. At zero temperature, by varying the strength of the coupling to
the bath the chain undergoes a quantum phase transition between a Luttinger
liquid phase and a spin density wave (SDW). As opposed to the standard
mechanism, the SDW emerges in the absence of the opening of a gap, but it is
due to ``fractional excitations" induced by the bath. We also show, by
computing the DC conductivity, that the system is insulating in the presence of
a subohmic bath. We interpret this phenomenon as localization induced by the
bath \`a la Caldeira and Leggett.

Exotic quantum states could be induced due to the interplay of various
degrees of freedom such as charge, spin, orbital, and lattice. Recently, a
novel short-ranged charge order (CO) was discovered deep inside the
antiferromagnetic phase of a correlated Kagome magnet FeGe. Since the
spin-polarization is significantly enhanced in the CO state, magnetism may play
an important role. However, its short-ranged nature hinders the precise
identification of CO properties, and its mechanism is still controversial.
Here, we report the observation of a long-ranged CO in high-quality FeGe
samples, in contrast to the previously reported short-ranged ones. Moreover,
the distorted 2*2*2 CO superstructure could now be precisely refined, which is
characterized by a strong dimerization along the c-axis of 1/4 of the Ge1-sites
in the Fe3Ge layers. Our results provide strong support to the recent
theoretical prediction (arXiv:2304.01604), where the CO in FeGe is driven by
saving magnetic exchange energies via such dimerization. Consequently, the
enhancement of spin-polarization and the previously observed short-ranged CO
can be understood. Our experiments combined with the theory, have provided a
comprehensive understanding of the puzzling CO behavior in FeGe, and
established a novel charge order mechanism conspired by magnetism and lattice,
different from conventional charge density wave mechanisms.

<h3>Finite momentum superconductivity in superconducting hybrids: Orbital  mechanism</h3>

Normally in superconductors, as in conductors, in the state with zero current
$I$ the momentum of superconducting electrons $\hbar q =0$. Here we demonstrate
theoretically and present experimental evidences that in superconducting/normal
metal (SN) hybrid strip placed in in-plane magnetic field $B_{in}$ finite
momentum state ($\hbar q \neq 0$) is realized when $I=0$. This state is
characterized by current-momentum dependence $I(q)\neq -I(-q)$, nonreciprocal
kinetic inductance $L_k(I) \neq L_k(-I)$ and different values of depairing
currents $I_{dep}^{\pm}$ flowing along the SN strip in opposite directions.
Found properties have {\it orbital} nature and are originated from gradient of
density of superconducting electrons $\nabla n$ across the thickness of SN
strip and field induced Meissner currents. We argue that this type of finite
momentum state should be rather general phenomena in superconducting structures
with artificial or intrinsic inhomogeneities.

Skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric materials are believed to occur due to the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In contrast, the skyrmion formation
mechanism in centrosymmetric materials remains elusive. Among those, Gd-based
compounds are the prototype compounds; however, their electronic structure is
not uncovered, even though it should be the foundation for elucidating the
skyrmion mechanism. Here, we reveal the intrinsic electronic structure of
GdRu2Si2 for the first time by magnetic domain selective measurements of
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In particular, we find the
robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the q-vector detected by the
previous resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) measurements. Most importantly, we
find that the pseudogap is opened at the nested portions of FS at low
temperatures. The momentum locations of the pseudogap vary for different
magnetic domains, most likely having a direct relationship with the screw-type
spin modulation that changes direction for each domain. Intriguingly, the
anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with 2-fold
symmetry. These results indicate the significance of
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, in which itinerant electrons
mediate to stabilize the local magnetic moment, as the mechanism for the
magnetism in the Gd-based skyrmion magnets. Our data also predict that the
momentum space where the pseudogap opens is doubled (or Fermi arcs shrink) and
thereby stabilizes the skyrmion phase under a magnetic field. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the flexible nature of magnetism in GdRu2Si2 by manipulating
magnetic domains with a magnetic field and temperature cyclings, providing a
possibility of future application for data storage and processing device with
centrosymmetric skyrmion magnets.

The emergent electric field (EEF) is a fictitious electric field acting on
conduction electrons through the Berry phase mechanism. The EEF is generated by
the dynamics of noncollinear spin configurations and becomes nonzero even in
one dimension. Although the EEF has been studied for several one-dimensional
chiral magnets, most of the theoretical studies were limited with respect to
the strength and direction of the magnetic fields. Furthermore, the effect of
edges of the system has not been clarified, whereas it can be crucial in nano-
and micro-scale samples. Here, we perform a theoretical study on the
momentum-frequency profile of the EEF in a one-dimensional chiral magnet while
changing the strength and direction of the magnetic field for both bulk and
finite-size chains with edges. As the bulk contributions, we find that the EEF
is resonantly enhanced at the magnetic resonance frequencies; interestingly,
the higher resonance modes are more clearly visible in the EEF response than in
the magnetic one. Furthermore, we show that the EEF is amplified along with the
solitonic feature of the spin texture introduced by the static magnetic field
perpendicular to the chiral axis. We also show that the static magnetic field
parallel to the chiral axis drives the EEF in the field direction, in addition
to much slower drift motion in the opposite direction associated with the
Archimedean screw dynamics, suggesting a DC electric current generation. As the
edge contributions, we find additional resonance modes localized at the edges
of the system that are also more clearly visible in the EEF response than the
magnetic one. Our results reveal that the emergent electric phenomena in
one-dimensional chiral magnets can be tuned by the magnetic field and the
sample size, and provide not only a good probe of the magnetic resonances but
also a platform for the applications to electronic devices.

The effect of a time-periodic perturbation, such as radiation, on a system
otherwise at equilibrium has been studied in the context of Floquet theory with
stationary states replaced by Floquet states and the energy replaced by
quasienergy. These quasienergy bands in general differ from the energy bands in
their dispersion and, especially in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, in
their states. This may, in some cases, alter the topology when the quasienergy
bands exhibit different topological invariants than their stationary
counterparts. In this work, motivated by advances in pump-probe techniques, we
consider the optical response of driven topological systems when the drive is
not purely periodic but is instead multiplied by a pulse shape/envelope
function. We use real time-evolved states to calculate the optical conductivity
and compare it to the response calculated using Floquet theory. We find that
the conductivity bears a memory of the initial equilibrium state even when the
pump is turned on slowly and the measurement is taken well after the ramp. The
response of the time-evolved system is interpreted as coming from Floquet bands
whose population has been determined by their overlap with the initial
equilibrium state. In particular, at band inversion points in the Brillouin
zone the population of the Floquet bands is inverted as well.

We investigated the temperature dependence of the conductance fluctuations in
thin films of the quasi-two-dimensional 1T-TaS2 van der Waals material. The
conductance fluctuations, determined from the derivative current-voltage
characteristics of two-terminal 1T-TaS2 devices, appear prominently at the
electric fields that correspond to the transitions between various
charge-density-wave macroscopic quantum condensate phases and at the onset of
the depinning of the charge density wave domains. The depinning threshold
field, ED, monotonically increases with decreasing temperature within the
nearly commensurate charge-density-wave phase. The ED value increases with the
decreasing 1T-TaS2 film thickness, revealing the surface pinning of the charge
density waves. Our analysis suggests that depinning is absent in the
commensurate phase. It is induced by the electric field but facilitated by
local heating. The measured trends for ED of the domain depinning are important
for understanding the physics of charge density waves in quasi-two-dimensional
crystals and for developing electronic devices based on this type of quantum
materials.

Diagrammatic summation is a common bottleneck in modern applications of
projected entangled-pair states (PEPS), especially in computing low-energy
excitations of a two dimensional quantum many-body system. To solve this
problem, here we extend the generating function approach for tensor network
diagrammatic summation, previously proposed in the context of matrix product
states. With the excited state expressed as a one-particle excitation, we show
that relevant objects in determining the variational parameters, i.e. effective
hamiltonian and norm matrices in the variational parameter space can be easily
computed in the generating function formalism, which can further be used in
evaluating the dynamical structure factor. Our benchmark results for the
spin-$1/2$ transverse field Ising model and Heisenberg model on the square
lattice provide a desirable accuracy, showing good agreement with known
results. Then we study the spin-$1/2$ $J_1-J_2$ model on the same lattice and
investigate the dynamical properties of the putative gapless spin liquid phase.
We conclude with a discussion on generalizations to multi-particle excitations.

We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of a three-dimensional lattice
glass model that has static properties compatible with the approach to a random
first-order transition. At very low temperatures, we observe that relaxation is
triggered by a small population of particles with low-energy barriers forming
mobile clusters. These emerging quasiparticles act as facilitating defects
responsible for the spatially heterogeneous dynamics of the system, whose
characteristic lengthscales remain strongly coupled to thermodynamic
fluctuations. We compare our findings both with existing theoretical models and
atomistic simulations of glass-formers.

To investigate the impact of non-linear interactions on dynamic coarse
graining, we study a simplified model system, featuring a tracer particle in a
complex environment. Using a projection operator formalism and computer
simulations, we systematically derive generalized Langevin equations describing
the dynamics of this particle. We compare different kinds of linear and
non-linear coarse-graining procedures to understand how non-linearities enter
reconstructed generalized Langevin equations and how they influence the
coarse-grained dynamics. For non-linear external potentials, we show
analytically and numerically that the non-Gaussian parameter and the incoherent
intermediate scattering function will not be correctly reproduced by the
generalized Langevin equation if a linear projection is applied. This, however,
can be overcome by using non-linear projection operators. We also study
anharmonic coupling between the tracer and the environment and demonstrate that
the reconstructed memory kernel develops an additional trap-dependent
contribution. Our study highlights some open challenges and possible solutions
in dynamic coarse graining.

properties. Here we show that opposite polarizations in ferroelectric domains
of a folded hBN layer can imprint local n and p doping in a semiconducting
transition metal dichalcogenide WSe2 monolayer. We demonstrate that WSe2 can be
used as an optical probe of ferroelectricity in hBN and show that the doping
density and type can be controlled with the position of the semiconductor with
respect to the ferroelectric interface. Our results establish the ferroelectric
hBN/WSe2 van der Waals stacking as a promising optoelectronic structure.

<h3>Enhanced Spin Hall Response From Aligned Kramers-Weyl Points in High  Chern Number Semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a spin Hall effect (SHE) enhancement mechanism due to Kramers-Weyl
point (KWP) alignment in chiral topological semimetals with high Chern numbers
(CNs). Through model Hamiltonian calculations, we identify enhancements in the
intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and the spin Hall angle (SHA). Such
enhancements, attributed to a unique high CN KWP energetic alignment and a high
degree of SOC-induced band nesting, strongly depend on orbital-orbital
interactions. This represents a novel mechanism to enhance SHE, differing from
the spin-orbit induced anticrossing mechanism in gapped systems. Guided by this
principle, we corroborate our results by means of first-principles calculations
and reveal multiple realistic materials with large intrinsic SHCs and even
larger SHAs than Pt.

We use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Fe-L$_3$ edge to
study the spin excitations of uniaxial-strained and unstrained
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ ($0\leq x\leq0.21$) samples. The measurements on unstrained
samples reveal dispersive spin excitations in all doping levels, which show
only minor doping dependence in energy dispersion, lifetime, and intensity,
indicating that high-energy spin excitations are only marginally affected by
sulfur doping. RIXS measurements on uniaxial-strained samples reveal that the
high-energy spin-excitation anisotropy observed previously in FeSe is also
present in the doping range $0< x\leq0.21$ of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$. The
spin-excitation anisotropy persists to a high temperature up to $T>200$ K in
$x=0.18$ and reaches a maximum around the nematic quantum critical doping
($x_c\approx0.17$). Since the spin-excitation anisotropy directly reflects the
existence of nematic spin correlations, our results indicate that high-energy
nematic spin correlations pervade the regime of nematicity in the phase diagram
and are enhanced by the nematic quantum criticality. These results emphasize
the essential role of spin fluctuations in driving electronic nematicity and
open the door for uniaxial strain tuning of spin excitations in quantum
materials hosting strong magnetoelastic coupling and electronic nematicity.

Recently synthetic gauge fields have been implemented on quantum simulators.
Unlike the gauge fields in the real world, in synthetic gauge fields, the gauge
charge can fluctuate and gauge invariance can be violated, which leading rich
physics unexplored before. In this work, we propose the gauge violation
spectroscopy as a useful experimentally accessible measurement in the synthetic
gauge theories. We show that the gauge violation spectroscopy exhibits no
dispersion. Using three models as examples, two of them can be exactly solved
by bosonization, and one has been realized in experiment, we further
demonstrate the gauge violation spectroscopy can be used to detect the
confinement and deconfinement phases. In the confinement phase, it shows a
delta function behavior, while in the deconfinement phase, it has a finite
width.

<br>
<br>
To enable the practical use of skyrmion-based devices, it is essential to
achieve a balance between energy efficiency and thermal stability, while also
ensuring reliable electrical detection against noise. Understanding how a
skyrmion interacts with material disorder and external perturbations is thus
essential. Here we investigate the electronic noise of a single skyrmion under
the influence of thermal fluctuations and spin currents in a magnetic thin
film. We detect the thermally induced noise with a 1/f signature in the strong
pinning regime but a random telegraph noise in the intermediate pinning regime.
Both the thermally dominated and current-induced telegraph-like signals are
detected in the weak pinning regime. Our results provide a comprehensive
electronic noise picture of a single skyrmion, demonstrating the potential of
noise fluctuation as a valuable tool for characterizing the pinning condition
of a skyrmion. These insights could also aid in the development of low-noise
and reliable skyrmion-based devices.

<h3>Exploring the Impact of Ions on Oxygen K-Edge X-ray Absorption  Spectroscopy in NaCl Solution using the GW-Bethe-Salpeter-Equation Approach</h3>

<br>
<br>
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful experimental tool to probe
the local structure in materials with the core hole excitations. Here, the
oxygen K-edge XAS spectra of the NaCl solution and pure water are computed by
using a recently developed GW-BSE approach, based on configurations modeled by
path-integral molecular dynamics with the deep-learning technique. The neural
network is trained on ab initio data obtained with SCAN density functional
theory. The observed changes in the XAS features of the NaCl solution, compared
to those of pure water, are in good agreement between experimental and
theoretical results. We provided detailed explanations for these spectral
changes that occur when NaCl is solvated in pure water. Specifically, the
presence of solvating ion pairs leads to localization of electron-hole
excitons. Our theoretical XAS results support the theory that the effects of
the solvating ions on the H-bond network are mainly confined within the first
hydration shell of ions, however beyond the shell the arrangement of water
molecules remains to be comparable to that observed in pure water.

The spectral statistics of non-Hermitian random matrices are of importance as
a diagnostic tool for chaotic behavior in open quantum systems. Here, we
investigate the statistical properties of singular values in non-Hermitian
random matrices as an effective measure of quantifying dissipative quantum
chaos. By means of Hermitization, we reveal the unique characteristics of the
singular-value statistics that distinguish them from the complex-eigenvalue
statistics, and establish the comprehensive classification of the
singular-value statistics for all the 38-fold symmetry classes of non-Hermitian
random matrices. We also analytically derive the singular-value statistics of
small random matrices in the same spirit as the Wigner surmise, which well
describe those of large random matrices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
singular values of open quantum many-body systems follow the random-matrix
statistics, thereby identifying chaos and nonintegrability in open quantum
systems. Our work elucidates that the singular-value statistics serve as a
clear indicator of symmetry and lay a foundation for statistical physics of
open quantum systems.

<h3>Generalized formulation of theoretical maximum efficiency of light power  system based on photon entropy analysis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08223" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08223</a>

<i>Tetsuo Yabuki</i>
<br>
<br>
Several studies have investigated the theoretical maximum energy efficiency
(quasi-Carnot efficiency) of light power systems in terms of radiation
temperatures, that is, so-called effective temperature. Nonetheless, certain
questions remain unanswered. One of the reasons could be the confusion between
equilibrium and reversibility. Therefore, this study performed an entropy
analysis of a light power system based solely on reversibility in the quantum
statistical dynamics and without recourse to the concept of radiation
temperature. The results showed that the induced temperature coincides with the
effective temperature T_D ({\lambda}) of the radiation, provided its solid
angle {\Omega} is 4{\pi} and the degree of polarization P is 0. Several
quantitative analyses that cannot be performed with radiation temperature can
be performed using this formula. As examples, this article presents the
formulation of quasi-Carnot efficiency considering the entropy change caused by
light chemical reactions, such as that in photosynthesis, and the formulations
of several quantities under the radiation with arbitrary {\Omega} and P.
Furthermore, this article presents a more general formula for {\eta}_max that
can be applied to a light power system with an arbitrary absorption rate for
non-monochromatic light, which fills the gap between Carnot efficiency
{\eta}_C=1-T_out/T_in and Spanner efficiency {\eta}_S=1-4/3T_out/T_in in the
case of blackbody radiation. Finally, it is proved that the total entropy of
the solar radiation from the sun to the earth above the atmosphere remains at
an original value because the increase in the configuration space entropy owing
to dilution is completely canceled by the decrease in the momentum space
entropy owing to the decrease in the solid angle {\Omega}.

<br>
HoFe1-xMnxO3 (0 < x < 1) single crystals have been grown by the optical
floating zone technique. A structural transition from the orthorhombic to
hexagonal modification has been established in the crystals in the
concentration range of 0.7-0.8, which has been confirmed by the X-ray
diffraction data. For a series of the rhombic crystals, the room-temperature
Mossbauer study and magnetic measurements in the temperature range of 4.2-1000
K have been carried out. It has been observed that, with an increase in the
manganese content in the samples, the temperature of the spin-reorientation
transition increases significantly: from 60 K in the HoFeO3 compound to room
temperature in HoFe0.6Mn0.4O3. The magnetic measurements have shown that, upon
substitution of manganese for iron, the magnetic orientational type transition
changes from a second-order transition (AxFyGz -> CxGyFz) to first-order one
(AxFyGz -> GxCyAz) with a weak ferromagnetic moment only in the b direction
(for Pnma notation). The growth of the spin-reorientation transition
temperature has been attributed to the change in the value of the indirect
exchange in the iron subsystem under the action of manganese, which has been
found when studying the Mossbauer effect in the HoFe1-xMnxO3 (x < 0.4)
compound.

Strong interactions between charges and light-matter coupled quasiparticles
offer an intriguing prospect with applications from optoelectronics to
light-induced superconductivity. Here, we investigate how the interactions
between electrons and exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional semiconductor
microcavity can be resonantly enhanced due to a strong coupling to a trion,
i.e., an electron-exciton bound state. We develop a microscopic theory that
uses a strongly screened interaction between charges to enable the summation of
all possible diagrams in the polariton-electron scattering process. The
position and magnitude of the resonance is found to vary depending on the
values of the light-matter coupling and detuning, thus indicating a large
degree of tunability. We furthermore derive an analytic approximation of the
interaction strength based on universal lowenergy scattering theory. This is
found to match extremely well with our full calculation, indicating that the
trion resonance is near universal, depending more on the strength of the
light-matter coupling relative to the trion binding energy rather than on the
details of the electronic interactions. Thus, we expect the trion resonance in
polariton-electron scattering to appear in a broad range of microcavity systems
with few semiconductor layers, such as doped monolayer MoSe2 where such
resonances have recently been observed experimentally [Sidler et al., Nature
Physics 13, 255 (2017)].

absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as well as X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES)
calculations for titanium (Ti), titanium oxide (TiO), and titanium dioxide
(TiO$_2$) at the Ti K- and L-edges as well as O K-edge. XAS and XES in
combination with a multi-edge approach offer a detailed insight into the
electronic structure of materials since both the occupied and unoccupied
states, are probed. The experimental results are compared with ab initio
calculations from the OCEAN package which uses the Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE) approach. Using the same set of input parameters for each compound for
calculations at different edges, the transferability of the OCEAN calculations
across different spectroscopy methods and energy ranges is validated. Thus, the
broad applicability for analysing and interpreting the electronic structure of
materials with the OCEAN package is shown.

<h3>Experimentally Motivated Order of Length Scales Affect Shot Noise</h3>

Shot noise at a conductance plateau in a quantum point contact (QPC) can be
explained by considering equilibrations at the quantum Hall edges. The
indication from recent experiments is that the charge equilibration length is
much shorter than the thermal equilibration length. We discuss how this
discovery gives rise to different thermal equilibration regimes in the presence
of full charge equilibration. In this work, we classify these distinct regimes
via dc current-current correlations \emph{(electrical shot noise)} at distinct
QPC conductance plateaus for the edges of integer, particle-like, and hole-like
filling fractions in a two dimensional electron gas.

Generating out-of-plane spins in sputtered materials holds immense potential

spins from single-layer ferromagnetic Co layers, which are visualized through
helicity-dependent photomapping techniques. Our experiments have shown that
out-of-plane spin generation is dependent on the magnetization direction,

In this letter, following an extensive experimental validation, we perform
constant-volume shearing simulations of non-Brownian granular suspensions using
the discrete element method coupled with the lattice Boltzmann method. We
choose a wide range of solid fractions, shear rates, fluid viscosities,
particle sizes, and inter-particle frictional coefficients to obtain a scaling
solution for the viscous behavior of suspensions in both dilute and dense
regimes. This letter demonstrates that, with a proposed dilute-dense
transitional solid fraction, $\phi_d$, there exists a strong correlation
between the inverse relative viscosity and the shear stress. This work
incorporates both the $\phi$-dependence and the $\dot{\gamma}$-dependence of
suspension viscosity in a universal framework, which provides a scaling
solution for granular suspensions across dilute and dense regimes and sheds
light on the dilute-dense transition mechanisms.

This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to examine the
physisorption behavior of hydrocarbon molecules on a covalent graphene-nanotube
hybrid nanostructure. The results indicate that the adsorbed molecules undergo
self-diffusion into the nanotubes without the need for external driving forces,
primarily driven by significant variations in binding energy throughout
different regions. Notably, these molecules remain securely trapped within the
tubes even at room temperature, thanks to a ``gate'' effect observed at the
neck region, despite the presence of a concentration gradient that would
typically hinder such trapping. This mechanism of passive mass transport and
retention holds implications for the storage and separation of gas molecules.

<h3>Confinement of spinons in the XXZ spin-1/2 chain in presence of the  transverse magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the tuning effect of the transverse magnetic field on the
confinement of spinons in the infinite XXZ spin-1/2 chain. The spinon
confinement in this model takes place in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase
upon application on the staggered longitudinal magnetic field. The tuning
transverse magnetic field has mutually orthogonal uniform and staggered
components. The energy spectra of the two-spinon bound states (the 'mesons') in
the confinement regime are analytically calculated in this model using two
different perturbative schemes. The first one applies in the extreme
anisotropic (Ising) limit and employs the inverse anisotropy constant as a
small parameter. The second perturbative scheme, which applies at any
anisotropy in the gapped antiferromagnetic domain, exploits integrability of
the XXZ spin chain at zero magnetic field. The small parameters in this
techniques are the components of the transverse and staggered longitudinal
magnetic fields. It is shown, that the weak transverse magnetic field mixes the
transverse and longitudinal meson modes, and leads to the avoided crossing of
their energies upon increase of its strength. The explicit formulas for the
two-spinon contribution to the dynamical structure factors of local spin
operators are obtained as well in this model in the weak confinement regime for
the wave-vectors close to the points k=0 and k=\pi.

<br>
<br>
We study bi-directional associative neural networks that, exposed to noisy
examples of an extensive number of random archetypes, learn the latter (with or
without the presence of a teacher) when the supplied information is enough: in
this setting, learning is heteroassociative -- involving couples of patterns --
and it is achieved by reverberating the information depicted from the examples
through the layers of the network. By adapting Guerra's interpolation
technique, we provide a full statistical mechanical picture of supervised and
unsupervised learning processes (at the replica symmetric level of description)
obtaining analytically phase diagrams, thresholds for learning, a picture of
the ground-state in plain agreement with Monte Carlo simulations and
signal-to-noise outcomes. In the large dataset limit, the Kosko storage
prescription as well as its statistical mechanical picture provided by Kurchan,
Peliti, and Saber in the eighties is fully recovered. Computational advantages
in dealing with information reverberation, rather than storage, are discussed
for natural test cases. In particular, we show how this network admits an
integral representation in terms of two coupled restricted Boltzmann machines,
whose hidden layers are entirely built of by grand-mother neurons, to prove
that by coupling solely these grand-mother neurons we can correlate the
patterns they are related to: it is thus possible to recover Pavlov's Classical
Conditioning by adding just one synapse among the correct grand-mother neurons
(hence saving an extensive number of these links for further information
storage w.r.t. the classical autoassociative setting).

Nonlinear topological insulators have garnered substantial recent attention
as they have both enabled the discovery of new physics due to interparticle
interactions, and may have applications in photonic devices such as topological
lasers and frequency combs. However, due to the local nature of nonlinearities,
previous attempts to classify the topology of nonlinear systems have required
significant approximations that must be tailored to individual systems. Here,
we develop a general framework for classifying the topology of nonlinear
materials in any discrete symmetry class and any physical dimension. Our
approach is rooted in a numerical $K$-theoretic method called the spectral
localizer, which leverages a real-space perspective of a system to define local
topological markers and a local measure of topological protection. Our
nonlinear spectral localizer framework yields a quantitative definition of
topologically non-trivial nonlinear modes that are distinguished by the
appearance of a topological interface surrounding the mode. Moreover, we show
how the nonlinear spectral localizer can be used to understand a system's
topological dynamics, i.e., the time-evolution of nonlinearly induced
topological domains within a system. We anticipate that this framework will
enable the discovery and development of novel topological systems across a
broad range of nonlinear materials.

This paper examines the micro-parameters of superconductors. It studies the
modulations from weak van der Waals interaction to strong covalence bonding of
superconductors. In particular, we studied layered black phosphorus (BP) as a
function of pressure. These results reveal a rich scenario of phase transitions
and related quantum phenomena, which show that the phases exhibit
superconducting states at a pressure higher than 5.0 GPa. In addition, they
indicate an angle-dependent upper critical field that demonstrates the
dimensional characteristics of superconductivities. This result suggests that
the A17 and cubic phases are three-dimensional (3D). The A7 phase shows a
two-dimensional (2D) character. The 2D behavior is related to a weakened,
distorted, entangled interlayer coupling.

<br>
<br>
Mixed halide perovskites undergo phase segregation, manifested as spectral
red-shifting of photoluminescence spectra under illumination. In the
iodine-bromide mixed perovskites, the origin of the low-energy luminescence is
related to iodine-enriched domains formation. Such domains create favorable
bands for the induced carrier funneling into them. Despite the phase
segregation process is crucial for mixed halide perovskite-based
optoelectronics, numerous gaps exist within the understanding of this
phenomenon. One such gap pertains to the emergence of temporary and
intermediate photoluminescence peaks during the initial stages of phase
segregation. However, these peaks appear only within the first few seconds of
illumination. Nevertheless, the decreasing temperature may prolong these
initial stages. In this work, we carry out a detailed study of the temperature
dependence of anion segregation in MAPbBr_2I and MAPbBr2.5I0.5 halide
perovskites, to obtain a deeper comprehension of segregation processes,
particularly during their initial stages. The temporal evolution of
low-temperature photoluminescence reveals the undergoing of the intermediate
stage during the segregation process and temperature-related phase transition
from orthorhombic to tetragonal phase. To complement the phase segregation
study, the temperature dependence of time-resolved photoluminescence
spectroscopy is provided, allowing us to estimate the change in the
photoluminescence lifetimes for the initial and segregated peaks with
temperature.

<br>
<br>
We study dissipation as a function of sample thickness in solids under global
oscillatory shear applied to the top layer of the sample. Two types of damping
mechanism are considered: Langevin and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). In
the regime of low driving frequency, and under strain-controlled conditions, we
observe that for Langevin damping, dissipation increases with sample thickness,
while for DPD damping, it decreases. Under force-controlled conditions,
dissipation increases with sample thickness for both damping schemes. These
results can be physically understood by treating the solid as a one-dimensional
harmonic chain in the quasi-static limit, for which explicit equations (scaling
relations) describing dissipation as a function of chain length (sample
thickness) are provided. The consequences of these results, in particular
regarding the choice of damping scheme in computer simulations, are discussed.

Ultra-thin 2D materials have shown complete paradigm shift of understanding
of physical and electronic properties because of confinement effects, symmetry
breaking and novel phenomena at nanoscale. Bulk 2H-TaS2 undergoes an
incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) transition temperature, TI-CDW - 76
K, however, onset of CDW in atomically thin layers is not clear. We explored
the evidence of CDW instability in exfoliated atomically thin 2H-TaS2 using low
temperature Raman spectroscopy. We have emphasized on CDW associated modes, M1
- 125 cm-1, M2 -158 cm-1, and M3 -334 cm-1, with thickness - 3 nm (one
unit-cell). The asymmetric (Fano) line shape of M2 suggests evidence of strong
electron-phonon coupling, which mainly drives the CDW instability. Our
observations provide key evidence that the CDW can persists even in one-unit
cell with a TI-CDW well above - 200 K, which is higher than bulk 2H-TaS2.

Steady-flow dynamics of ferromagnetic 180$^{\circ}$ domain walls (180DWs) in
long and narrow spin valves (LNSVs) with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (IDMI) under spin currents with Slonczewski $g-$factor are
examined. Depending on the magnetization orientation of polarizers (pinned
layers of LNSVs), dynamics of 180DWs in free layers of LNSVs are subtly
manipulated: (i) For parallel polarizers, stronger spin polarization leads to
higher Walker limit thus ensures the longevity of faster steady flows.
Meantime, IDMI induces both the stable-region flapping and its width
enlargement. (ii) For perpendicular polarizers, a wandering of 180DWs between
bi- and tri-stability persists with the criticality adjusted by the IDMI. (iii)
For planar-transverse polarizers, IDMI makes the stable region of steady flows
completely asymmetric and further imparts a high saturation wall velocity under
large current density. Under the last two polarizers, the ultrahigh
differential mobility of 180DWs survives. The combination of Slonczewski spin
current and IDMI provides rich possibilities of fine controlling on 180DW
dynamics, hence opens avenues for magnetic nanodevices with rich functionality
and high robustness.

<h3>Evidence for a conical spin spiral state in the Mn triple-layer on  W(001): spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and first-principles  calculations</h3>

The spin structure of a Mn triple layer grown pseudomorphically on surfaces
is studied using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) and
density functional theory (DFT). In SP-STM images a c$(4 \times 2)$ super
structure is found. The magnetic origin of this contrast is verified by
contrast reversal and using the c$(2 \times 2)$ AFM state of the Mn double
layer as a reference. SP-STM simulations show that this contrast can be
explained by a spin spiral propagating along the [110] direction with an angle
close to $90^\circ$ between magnetic moments of adjacent Mn rows. To understand
the origin of this spin structure, DFT calculations have been performed for a
large number of competing collinear and non-collinear magnetic states including
the effect of spin-orbit oupling (SOC). Surprisingly, a collinear state in
which the magnetic moments of top and central Mn layer are aligned antiparallel
and those of the bottom Mn layer are aligned parallel to the central layer is
the energetically lowest state. We show that in this so-called "up-down-down"
($\uparrow \downarrow \downarrow$) state the magnetic moments in the Mn bottom
layer are only induced by those of the central Mn layer. Flat spin spirals
propagating either in one, two, or all Mn layers are shown to be energetically
unfavorable to the collinear $\uparrow \downarrow \downarrow$ state even upon
including the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, conical spin
spirals with a small opening angle of about $10^\circ$ are only slightly
energetically unfavorable within DFT and could explain the experimental
observations. Surprisingly, the DFT energy dispersion of conical spin spirals
including SOC cannot be explained if only the DMI is taken into account.
Therefore, higher-order interactions such as chiral biquadratic terms need to
be considered which could explain the stabilization of a conical spin spiral
state.

In the nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride (Lu-H-N) system, the presence of Lu-N
chemical bonds plays a key role in the emergence of possible room-temperature
superconductivity at near ambient pressure. However, due to the synthesis of
single-crystalline LuN being a big challenge, the understanding of LuN is
insufficient thus far. Here, we report on the epitaxial growth of
single-crystalline LuN films. The crystal structures of LuN films were
characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The measurement of
low-temperature electrical transport indicates the LuN film is semiconducting
from 300 to 2 K, yielding an activation gap of $\sim$ 0.02 eV. Interestingly,
negative magnetoresistances can be observed below 12 K, which can result from
the defects and magnetic impurities in LuN films. Our results uncover the
electronic and magnetic properties of single-crystalline LuN films.

<h3>Temporal fluctuations of correlators in integrable and chaotic quantum  systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
We provide bounds on temporal fluctuations around the infinite-time average
of out-of-time-ordered and time-ordered correlators of many-body quantum
systems without energy gap degeneracies. For physical initial states, our
bounds predict the exponential decay of the temporal fluctuations as a function
of the system size. We numerically verify this prediction for chaotic and
interacting integrable spin-1/2 chains, which satisfy the assumption of our
bounds. On the other hand, we show analytically and numerically that for the XX
model, which is a noninteracting system with gap degeneracies, the temporal
fluctuations decay polynomially with system size for operators that are local
in the fermion representation and decrease exponentially in the system size for
non-local operators. Our results demonstrate that the decay of the temporal
fluctuations of correlators cannot be used as a reliable metric of chaos or
lack thereof.

We predict a new kind of topological defect in ferroelectric barium titanate
which we call a skyrme line. These are line-like objects characterized by
skyrmionic topological charge. As well as configurations with integer charge,
the charge density can split into well-localized fractional parts. We show that
under certain conditions the fractional skyrme lines are stable. We discuss a
mechanism to create fractional topological charge objects and investigate their
stability.

The orbital Hall effect can generate currents of angular momentum more
efficiently than the spin Hall effect in most metals. However, so far, it has
only been understood as a steady state phenomenon. In this theoretical study,
the orbital Hall effect is extended into the time domain. We investigate the
orbital angular momenta and their currents induced by a femtosecond laser pulse
in a Cu nanoribbon. Our numerical simulations provide detailed insights into
the laser-driven electron dynamics on ultrashort timescales with atomic
resolution. The ultrafast orbital Hall effect described in this work is
consistent with the familiar pictorial representation of the static orbital
Hall effect, but we also find pronounced differences between physical
quantities that carry orbital angular momentum and those that carry charge. For
example, there are deviations in the time series of the respective currents.
This study lays the foundations for investigating ultrafast Hall effects in
confined metallic systems.

<h3>Quantum-mechanical effects in photoluminescence from thin crystalline  gold films</h3>

Luminescence constitutes a unique source of insight into hot carrier
processes in metals, including those in plasmonic nanostructures, for sensing
and energy applications. However, being weak in nature, metal luminescence
remains poorly understood, its microscopic origin strongly debated, and its
potential for understanding nanoscale carrier dynamics largely unexploited.
Here we reveal quantum-mechanical effects emanating in the luminescence from
thin monocrystalline gold flakes. Specifically, we present experimental
evidence and develop a first-principles parameterized model of bulk gold
luminescence to demonstrate luminescence is photoluminescence when exciting in
the interband regime. Our model allows us to identify changes to gold
luminescence due to quantum-mechanical effects as gold film thickness is
reduced. Excitingly, we observe quantum mechanical effects in the luminescence
signal for flakes thinner than 40 nm, due to changes in the band structure near
the Fermi level. We qualitatively reproduce these effects with first-principles
modelling. Thus, we present a unified description of luminescence in gold,
enabling its widespread application as a probe of carrier dynamics and
light-matter interactions in this material and paving the way for future
explorations of hot carriers and charge transfer dynamics in a multitude of
systems.

The iron-based pnictide LaFe2As2 is not superconducting as-synthesized, but
it becomes such below Tc around 12 K upon annealing, as a consequence of a
structural transition from a phase with collapsed tetragonal crystal structure
to an uncollapsed phase. In this work, we carry out specific heat, Raman
spectroscopy and normal state electric and thermoelectric transport
measurements in the collapsed and uncollapsed LaFe2As2 phases to gain insight
into the electron interactions and their possible role in the superconducting
pairing mechanism. Despite clear features of strong electron-phonon coupling
observed in both phases, neither the low energy phonon spectra nor the
electron-phonon coupling show significant differences between the two phases.
Conversely, the Sommerfield constants are significantly different in the two
phases, pointing to much higher electron correlation in the superconducting
uncollapsed phase and confirming theoretical studies.

<h3>Decomposing imaginary time Feynman diagrams using separable basis  functions: Anderson impurity model strong coupling expansion</h3>

We present a deterministic algorithm for the efficient evaluation of
imaginary time diagrams based on the recently introduced discrete Lehmann
representation (DLR) of imaginary time Green's functions. In addition to the
efficient discretization of diagrammatic integrals afforded by its
approximation properties, the DLR basis is separable in imaginary time,
allowing us to decompose diagrams into linear combinations of nested sequences
of one-dimensional products and convolutions. Focusing on the strong coupling
bold-line expansion of generalized Anderson impurity models, we show that our
strategy reduces the computational complexity of evaluating an $M$th-order
diagram at inverse temperature $\beta$ from $\mathcal{O}(\beta^{2M-1})$ for a
direct quadrature to $\mathcal{O}(M \log^{M+1} \beta)$, with controllable
high-order accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm using third-order expansions
for multi-band impurity problems with off-diagonal hybridization and spin-orbit
coupling, presenting comparisons with exact diagonalization and quantum Monte
Carlo approaches. In particular, we perform a self-consistent dynamical
mean-field theory calculation for a three-band Hubbard model with strong
spin-orbit coupling representing a minimal model of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$,
demonstrating the promise of the method for modeling realistic strongly
correlated multi-band materials. For expansions of low and intermediate order,
in which diagrams can be enumerated, our method provides an efficient,
straightforward, and robust black-box evaluation procedure. In this sense, it
fills a gap between diagrammatic approximations of the lowest order, which are
simple and inexpensive but inaccurate, and those based on Monte Carlo sampling
of high-order diagrams.

<h3>Induced superconducting correlations in the quantum anomalous Hall  insulator</h3>

Inducing Cooper pairing in a thin ferromagnetic topological insulator in the
quantum anomalous Hall state (called quantum anomalous Hall insulator, QAHI) is
a promising way to realize topological superconductivity with associated chiral
Majorana edge states. However, finding evidence of superconducting proximity
effect in a QAHI has proven to be a considerable challenge due to inherent
experimental difficulties. Here we report the observation of crossed Andreev
reflection (CAR) across a narrow superconducting Nb electrode contacting the
chiral edge state of a QAHI, evinced by a negative nonlocal voltage measured
downstream from the grounded Nb electrode. This is an unambiguous signature of
induced superconducting pair correlation in the chiral edge state. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that CAR processes of the chiral edge are not
strongly dependent on the nature of the superconductivity that mediates them.
Nevertheless, the characteristic length of the CAR process is found to be much
longer than the superconducting correlation length in Nb, which suggests that
the CAR is in fact mediated by superconductivity induced on the QAHI surface.
The approach and results presented here provide a foundation for future studies
of topological superconductivity and Majorana physics, as well as for the
search for non-Abelian zero modes.

<h3>Test for BCS-BEC Crossover in the Cuprate Superconductors</h3>

In this paper we present concrete conditions in order to assess the
applicability of BCS-BEC crossover theory in the cuprates. We aim to establish
where within the BCS-BEC spectrum the cuprate superconductors should lie. This
work amplifies the essential point made in a recent paper which claimed to
observe absence of a BCS-BEC crossover in the cuprate superconductors. More
precisely, this previous work presented data which established that the
cuprates are far from the BEC limit, a conclusion with which the high-$T_c$
community is, presumably, in full agreement. Their analysis, however, was not
inconsistent with a scenario in which these superconductors are somewhere
\textit{intermediate} between BCS and BEC. Where precisely the cuprates sit
within this spectrum is shown to be directly reflected in the superconducting
coherence length near $T_c$. This work, which includes detailed predictions,
calls attention to the importance of arriving at a systematic determination of
this parameter throughout the $T_c$ dome for the entire class of cuprate
superconductors.

<br>
<br>
Nonlinear planar magnetotransport is ubiquitous in topological HgTe
structures, both in tensile (topological insulator) or compressively strained
layers (Weyl semimetal phase). We show that the common reason for the nonlinear
planar magnetotransport is the presence of tilted Dirac cones combined with the
formation of charge puddles. The origin of the tilted Dirac cones is the mix of
the Zeeman term due to the in-plane magnetic field and quadratic contributions
to the dispersion relation. We develop a network model that mimics transport of
tilted Dirac fermions in the landscape of charge puddles. The model captures
the essential features of the experimental data. It should be relevant for
nonlinear planar magnetotransport in a variety of topological and small band
gap materials.

<h3>Steady oscillations in aggregation-fragmentation processes</h3>

<br>

We report surprising steady oscillations in aggregation-fragmentation
processes. Oscillating solutions are observed for the class of aggregation
kernels $K_{i,j} = i^{\nu}j^{\mu} + j^{\nu}i^{\mu}$ homogeneous in masses $i$
and $j$ of merging clusters and fragmentation kernels, $F_{ij}=\lambda K_{ij}$,
with parameter $\lambda$ quantifying the intensity of the disruptive impacts.
We assume a complete decomposition (shattering) of colliding partners into
monomers. We show that an assumption of a steady-state distribution of cluster
sizes, compatible with governing equations, yields a power law with an
exponential cutoff. This prediction agrees with simulations results when $
\theta \equiv \nu-\mu <1$. For $ \theta=\nu-\mu >1$, however, the densities
exhibit an oscillatory behavior. While these oscillations decay for not very
small $\lambda$, they become steady if $\theta$ is close to two and $\lambda$
is very small. Simulation results lead to a conjecture that for $ \theta <1$
the system has a stable fixed point, corresponding to the steady-state density
distribution, while for any $\theta >1 $ there exists a critical value
$\lambda_c(\theta )$, such that for $\lambda < \lambda_c(\theta)$, the system
has an attracting limit cycle. This is rather striking for a closed system of
Smoluchowski-like equations, lacking any sinks and sources of mass.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic flux piercing a carbon nanotube induce periodic gap oscillations
which represent the Aharonov-Bohm effect at nanoscale. Here we point out, by
analyzing numerically the anisotropic Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice,
that similar oscillations should be observable when uniaxial strain is applied
to a nanotube. In both cases, a vector potential (magnetic- or strain-induced)
may affect the measurable quantities at zero field. The analysis, carried out
within the Gutzwiller Approximation, shows that for small semiconducting
nanotube with zigzag edges and realistic value of the Hubbard repulsion
($U/t_0=1.6$, with $t_0\approx{}2.5\,$eV being the equilibrium hopping
integral) energy gap can be reduced by a factor of more than $100$ due to the
strain.
