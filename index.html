<h3>Dynamical tunneling across the separatrix</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10219</a>
<br>
<i>Yasutaka Hanada, Akira Shudo, Kensuke S. Ikeda</i>
<p>The strong enhancement of tunneling couplings typically observed in tunneling
splittings in the quantum map is investigated. We show that the transition from
instanton to noninstanton tunneling, which is known to occur in tunneling
splittings in the space of the inverse Planck constant, takes place in a
parameter space as well. By applying the absorbing perturbation technique, we
find that the enhancement invoked as a result of local avoided crossings and
that originating from globally spread interactions over many states should be
distinguished and that the latter is responsible for the strong and persistent
enhancement. We also provide evidence showing that the coupling across the
separatrix in phase-space is crucial in explaining the behavior of tunneling
splittings by performing the wave-function-based observation. In the light of
these findings, we examine the validity of the resonance-assisted tunneling
theory.

<h3>Model order reduction for the TASEP Master equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10234</a>
<br>
<i>Kilian Pioch, Thomas Kriecherbauer, Michael Margaliot, Lars Gr√ºne</i>
<p>The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a stochastic model
for the unidirectional dynamics of interacting particles on a 1D-lattice that
is much used in systems biology and statistical physics. Its master equation
describes the evolution of the probability distribution on the state space. The
size of the master equation grows exponentially with the length of the lattice.
It is known that the complexity of the system may be reduced using mean field
approximations. We provide a rigorous derivation and a stochastic
interpretation of these approximations and present numerical results on their
accuracy for a number of relevant cases

<i>Dhananjay Saikumar</i>
<p>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique that utilizes
quantum tunneling to visualize atomic surfaces with high precision. This study
presents detailed topographic maps and evaluates the local density of states
(LDOS) for three distinct materials: Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG),
gold, and silicon. By meticulously measuring the tunneling current from a
finely pointed tip positioned nanometers above the sample, we successfully
image the surface topography of HOPG, revealing a lattice constant of $0.28 \pm
0.01$ nm. Additionally, we determine the local work functions for gold and
graphite to be $0.7 \pm 0.1$ eV and $0.5 \pm 0.1$ eV, respectively. Employing
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, this work further investigates the LDOS for
gold (a metal), graphite (a semi-metal), and silicon (a semiconductor),
providing valuable insights into their electronic properties at the atomic
level.

<h3>Liouvillian skin effects and fragmented condensates in an integrable  dissipative Bose-Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10261</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher Ekman, Emil J. Bergholtz</i>
<p>Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental
interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze.
We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself
evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the
presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably,
the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of
the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of
disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz
solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features
of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring
non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly
degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented
condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold
atoms.

<h3>Critical temperature of triplet superconductor-ferromagnet bilayers as a  probe for pairing symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10266" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10266</a>
<br>
<i>Erik Wegner Hodt, Carla Cirillo, Angelo Di Bernardo, Carmine Attanasio, Jacob Linder</i>
<p>Identifying superconducting materials with spin-polarized Cooper pairs is an
important objective both for exploration of new fundamental physics and for
cryogenic applications in spintronics and quantum sensing. We here compute the
critical temperature $T_c$ of the superconducting transition in a bilayer
comprised of a superconductor with an intrinsic spin-triplet order parameter
and a ferromagnet. We determine how $T_c$ varies both with the thickness of the
ferromagnet and its magnetization direction. We show that both the orbital and
spin part of the triplet superconducting order parameter leave clear signatures
in $T_c$ which do not appear in a bilayer of a conventional s-wave
superconductor and a ferromagnet. In particular, the dependence of $T_c$ on
these variables changes depending on whether or not the superconducting order
parameter features Andreev bound-states and also changes qualitatively when the
magnetization is rotated in the plane of the ferromagnetic film. Measurements
of $T_c$ in such bilayers are therefore useful to identify the pairing symmetry
of intrinsic triplet superconductors.

<h3>Investigating finite-size effects in random matrices by counting  resonances</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271</a>
<br>
<i>Anton Kutlin, Carlo Vanoni</i>
<p>Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix
Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in
principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the
downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of
resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical
observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap
ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the
thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson
localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances
and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future
application of the method to finite-size systems.

<h3>Extracting the current-phase-relation of a monolithic three-dimensional  nano-constriction using a DC-current-tunable superconducting microwave cavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10276" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10276</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin Uhl, Daniel Hackenbeck, Dieter Koelle, Reinhold Kleiner, Daniel Bothner</i>
<p>Superconducting circuits with nonlinear elements such as Josephson tunnel
junctions or kinetic inductance nanowires are the workhorse for microwave
quantum and superconducting sensing technologies. For devices, which can be
operated at high temperatures and large magnetic fields, nano-constrictions as
nonlinear elements are recently under intense investigation. Constrictions,
however, are far less understood than conventional Josephson tunnel junctions,
and their current-phase-relationships (CPRs) -- although highly important for
device design -- are hard to predict. Here, we present a niobium microwave
cavity with a monolithically integrated, neon-ion-beam patterned
three-dimensional (3D) nano-constriction. By design, we obtain a
DC-current-tunable microwave circuit and characterize how the
bias-current-dependent constriction properties impact the cavity resonance.
Based on the results of these experiments, we reconstruct the CPR of the
nanoconstriction. Finally, we discuss the Kerr nonlinearity of the device, a
parameter important for many high-dynamic-range applications and an
experimental probe for the second and third derivatives of the CPR. Our
platform provides a useful method to comprehensively characterize nonlinear
elements integrated in microwave circuits and could be of interest for current
sensors, hybrid quantum systems and parametric amplifiers. Our findings
furthermore contribute to a better understanding of nano-fabricated 3D
constrictions.

<h3>NiOx passivation in perovskite solar cells: from surface reactivity to  device performance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10286" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10286</a>
<br>
<i>John Mohanraj, Bipasa Samanta, Osbel Almora, Ren√°n Escalante, Lluis F. Marsal, Sandra Jenatsch, Arno Gadola, Beat Ruhstaller, Juan A. Anta, Maytal Caspary Toroker, Selina Olthof</i>
<p>Non-stoichiometric nickel oxide (NiOx) is the only metal oxide successfully
used as hole transport material in p-i-n type perovskite solar cells (PSCs).
Its favorable opto-electronic properties and facile large-scale preparation
methods are potentially relevant for future commercialization of PSCs, though
currently low operational stability of PSCs containing NiOx hole transport
layers are reported. Poorly understood degradation reactions at the interface
to the perovskite are seen as cause for the inferior stability and a variety of
interface passivation approaches have been shown to be effective in improving
the overall solar cell performance. To gain a better understanding of the
processes happening at this interface, we systematically passivated possible
specific defects on NiOx with three different categories of organic/inorganic
compounds. The effects on the NiOx and the perovskite (MAPbI3) were
investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) where we find that the structural
stability and film formation can be significantly affected. In combination with
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, a likely origin of
NiOx-perovskite degradation interactions is proposed. The surface passivated
NiOx was incorporated into MAPbI3 based PSCs and its influence on overall
performance, particularly operational stability, was investigated by
current-voltage (J-V), impedance spectroscopy (IS), and open circuit voltage
decay (OCVD) measurements. Interestingly, we find that a superior structural
stability due to an interface passivation must not relate to high operational
stability. The discrepancy comes from the formation of excess ions at the
interface which negatively impacts all solar cell parameters.

<h3>Standing spin waves in Permalloy-NiO bilayers as a probe of the  interfacial exchange coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10292" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10292</a>
<br>
<i>Diego Caso, Ana Garc√≠a-Prieto, Eugenia Sebastiani-Tofano, Akashdeep Kamra, Cayetano Hern√°ndez, Pilar Prieto, Farkhad G. Aliev</i>
<p>Ferromagnetic/Antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) bilayers dynamics have been a recent
topic of interest due to the interaction occurring at the interface, where the
magnetic moments of the AFM can be imprinted into the FM, and the exchange bias
field can affect these dynamics. Here, we investigate Permalloy (Py) and NiO
(Py/NiO) hybrids and for comparison single Py films in the broad Py thickness
range varied from few nm to 200 nm by using static (Kerr effect) and dynamic
(spin waves) measurements along with micromagnetic simulations. We observe
hybrid modes between uniform (ferromagnetic resonance FMR, n=0) and
perpendicular standing spin waves (PSSWs, n=1, 2) and a clear enhancement of
the PSSWs modes frequencies upon interfacing Py with NiO both from experiments
and simulations. This enhancement becomes less pronounced as the thickness of
the film increases, demonstrating its interfacial origin rooted in the exchange
coupling between the FM and AFM layers. Besides, through micromagnetic
simulations, we investigate and correlate changes in spatial profiles of the
PSSWs with the interfacial exchange coupling. As the thickness is increased, we
see that the n=1 and n=2 modes begin to couple with the fundamental FMR mode,
resulting in asymmetric (with respect the Py layer center) modes. Our results
suggest that PSSWs detection in a ferromagnet offers a means of probing the
interfacial exchange coupling with the adjacent AFM layer. Furthermore, the
controlled spatial symmetry breaking by the AFM layer enables engineering of
PSSWs with different spatial profiles in the FM.

<h3>Quasicrystals as an intermediate form of matter between crystalline and  amorphous solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10295" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10295</a>
<br>
<i>Kun Zhao, Matteo Baggioli, Wen-Sheng Xu, Jack F. Douglas, Yun-Jiang Wang</i>
<p>Quasicrystals have been observed in a variety of materials ranging from metal
alloys to block copolymers and represent an "intermediate" form of matter
between crystals and amorphous materials (glasses and liquids) in that their
structural and dynamical properties can not readily described in terms of
conventional solid-state models of liquids and solids. In the present work, we
present a comprehensive analysis of basic thermodynamic and dynamic properties
of quasicrystals to better understand the nature of the atomic motion
underlying diffusion and structural relaxation in these materials. As our model
system, we investigate a dodecagonal quasicrystal using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations in two dimensions (2D), subject to periodic boundary conditions. We
observe a two-stage relaxation dynamics in the self-intermediate scattering
function $F_s(k,t)$ of our quasicrystal material involving a fast
$\beta$-relaxation on a ps timescale and $\alpha$ relaxation process having a
highly temperature dependent relaxation time whose activation energy varies in
concert with the extent of string-like collective motion. Multi-step relaxation
of the intermediate scattering function and string-like collective atomic
motion have similarly been observed ubiquitously in glass-forming liquids at
low temperatures and in crystalline materials at elevated temperatures where
structural relaxation and diffusion are both non-Arrhenius. After examining the
dynamics of our quasi-crystalline material in great detail, we conclude that
its dynamics more closely resemble observations on metallic glass-forming
liquids, in qualitative accord with previous neutron scattering studies.

<h3>Quantum dynamics of superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor Josephson  junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10330" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10330</a>
<br>
<i>Utkan G√ºng√∂rd√º, Rusko Ruskov, Silas Hoffmann, Kyle Serniak, Andrew J. Kerman, Charles Tahan</i>
<p>Josephson junctions constructed from superconductor-quantum
dot-superconductor (S-QD-S) heterostructures have been used to realize a
variety of voltage-tunable superconducting quantum devices, including qubits
and parametric amplifiers. In such devices, the interplay between the charge
degree of freedom associated with the quantum dot and its environment must be
considered for faithful modeling of circuit dynamics. Here we describe the
self-consistent quantization of a capacitively-shunted S-QD-S junction via
path-integral formulation. In the effective Hamiltonian, the Josephson
potential for the Andreev bound states reproduces earlier results for static
phase bias, whereas the charging energy term has new features: (i) the system's
capacitance is renormalized by the junction gate voltage, an effect which
depends on the strength of the tunneling rates between the dot and its
superconducting leads as well, and (ii) an additional charge offset appears for
asymmetric junctions. These results are important to understand future
experiments and quantum devices incorporating S-QD-S junctions in arbitrary
impedance environments.

<h3>Athermal granular creep in a quenched sandpile</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10338" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10338</a>
<br>
<i>Nakul S. Deshpande, Paulo E. Arratia, Douglas J. Jerolmack</i>
<p>Creep is a generic descriptor of slow motions -- in the context of materials,
it describes quasi-static deformation of a solid when subjected to stresses
below the global yield, at which all rigidity collapses and the material flows.
Here, we experimentally investigate creep, flow, and the transition between the
two states in a granular heap flow. Within the surface flowing layer the
dimensionless strain rate diminishes with depth, there is an absence of spatial
correlations, and there is no aging dynamics. Beneath this layer, the bulk
creeps via localized avalanches of plasticity, and there is significant aging.
The transition between fast surface flow and slow bulk creep and aging is
observed to be in the vicinity of a critical inertial number of $I = 10^{-5}$.
Surprisingly, at the cessation of surface flow and the `quenching' of the pile,
creep persists in the absence of the flowing layer; albeit with significant
differences for a pile that experiences a long duration of surface flow
(strongly annealed) and one where flow during preparation does not last long
(weakly annealed). Our results contribute to an emerging view of athermal
granular creep, showing similarities across dry and submerged systems. Quenched
quiescent heaps that creep indefinitely, however, present a challenge to
granular rheology, and open new possibilities for interpreting and casting
creep and deformation of soils in nature.

<h3>Evaluating the transport properties of interface-type, analog memristors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10358" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10358</a>
<br>
<i>Sahitya V. Vegesna, Venkata Rao Rayapati, Heidemarie Schmidt</i>
<p>Interface-type, analog memristors have quite a reputation for real-time
applications in edge sensorics, edge computing, and neuromorphic computing. The
n-type conducting BiFeO3 (BFO) is such an interface-type, analog memristor
which is also nonlinear and can therefore not only store, but also process data
in the same memristor cell without data transfer between the data storage unit
and the data processing unit. Here we present a physical memristor model which
describes the hysteretic current-voltage curves of the BFO memristor in the
small and large current-voltage range. Extracted internal state variables are
reconfigured by the ion drift in the two write branches and are determining the
electron transport in the two read branches. Simulation of electronic circuits
with the BFO interface-type, analog memristors was not possible so far because
previous physical memristor models have not captured the full range of internal
state variables. We show quantitative agreement between modeled and
experimental current-voltage curves exemplarily of three different BFO
memristors in the small and large current-voltage ranges. Extracted dynamic and
static internal state variables in the two full write branches and in the two
full read branches, respectively, can be used for simulating electronic
circuits with BFO memristors, e.g. in edge sensorics, edge computing, and
neuromorphic computing.

<h3>Theory of Wetting Dynamics with Surface Binding</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10405" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10405</a>
<br>
<i>Xueping Zhao, Susanne Liese, Alf Honigmann, Frank J√ºlicher, Christoph A. Weber</i>
<p>Biomolecules, such as proteins and RNAs, can phase separate in the cytoplasm
of cells to form biological condensates. Such condensates are liquid-like
droplets that can wet biological surfaces such as membranes. Many molecules
that can participate in phase separation can also reversibly bind to membrane
surfaces. When a droplet wets such a surface, these molecules can diffuse both
inside the droplet or in the bound state on the surface. How the interplay
between surface binding and surface diffusion affects the wetting kinetics is
not well understood. Here, we derive the governing equations using
non-equilibrium thermodynamics by relating the diffusive fluxes and forces at
the surface coupled to the bulk. We use our theory to study the spreading
kinetics in the presence of surface binding and find that binding speeds up
wetting by nucleating a droplet inside the surface. Our results are relevant
both to artificial systems and to condensates in cells. They suggest that the
wetting of droplets in living cells could be regulated by two-dimensional
droplets in the surface-bound layer changing the binding affinity to biological
surfaces.

<h3>Orbital Competition in Bilayer Graphene's Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10440" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10440</a>
<br>
<i>Bishoy M. Kousa, Nemin Wei, Allan H. MacDonald</i>
<p>The lowest Landau level of bilayer graphene has an octet of internal degrees
of freedom, composed from spin, valley and orbital two-level systems. Dominance
of $n=0$ orbitals over $n=1$ orbitals in low energy quantum fluctuations leads
to distinct fractional quantum Hall characteristics compared dominance of $n=1$
over $n=0$. The competition between $n=0$ and $n=1$ orbitals depends
sensitively on particle-hole asymmetry and on Lamb shifts due to exchange
interactions with the negative energy sea, which must be accounted for
simultaneously in assessing the orbital competition. We identify the
circumstances under which $n=1$, which supports strong even-denominator FQH
states with non-abelian quasiparticles, emerges robustly as the low-energy
Landau level.

<h3>Light-Hole Spin Confined in Germanium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10449" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10449</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick Del Vecchio, Oussama Moutanabbir</i>
<p>The selective confinement of light holes (LHs) in tensile strained germanium
(Ge) is achieved by introducing Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$/Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$
heterostructures. By evaluating their electronic structure as a function of Sn
content, residual strain, and Ge well thickness., it is shown that above
$12\,\text{at.}\%$ Sn and below $0.4\%$ residual compressive strain in the
barriers, the tensile strain in Ge becomes sufficiently large to yield a
valence band edge with LH-like character, thus forming a quasi two-dimensional
LH gas in Ge. The LH ground state has a larger in-plane effective mass than
that of heavy hole (HH) in Si$_{1-y}$Ge$_y$/Ge/Si$_{1-y}$Ge$_y$ quantum wells.
LHs in optimal Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$/Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ heterostructures exhibit a
strong $g$-tensor anisotropy, with the in-plane component one order of
magnitude larger than that of HHs in planar systems. Moreover, two of three
structure-inversion-asymmetry Rashba parameters, both of which are critical in
electric-dipole-spin-resonance (EDSR) experiments, are effectively ten times
the size of the cubic Rashba parameter in HH quantum wells. In the regime of LH
selective confinement, every layer of the heterostructure is of direct bandgap
which can be relevant to achieve efficient optical photon-spin qubit
interfaces. This work discusses the broad landscape of the characteristics of
LH spins confined in Ge to guide the design and implementation of LH spin-based
devices in Ge.

<h3>Electronic orders on the kagome lattice at the lower Van Hove filling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10455" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10455</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Qun Liu, Yan-Bin Liu, Wan-Sheng Wang, Da Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang</i>
<p>We study the electronic orders at the lower van Hove filling in the kagome
lattice. In the weak limit of the Hubbard interaction $U$ versus the hopping
parameter $t$, we find that the system develops itinerant ferromagnetism; In
the intermediate range of $U$, we find the system develops noncollinear
magnetic order with orthogonal spin moments on nearest-neighbor bonds. This is
in fact a Chern insulator supporting quantized anomalous Hall conductance; In
the strong $U$ limit, we map the Hubbard model to the $t$-$J$ model with $J =
4t^2/U$. For moderate values of $J$ we recover the noncollinear magnetic order
obtained in the Hubbard model. However, in the limit of $J\to 0$ (or $U\to
\infty$) we find the ferromagnetic order revives. The results are obtained by
combination of the random-phase approximation and functional renormalization
group in the weak to moderate limit of $U$, and the variational quantum Monte
Carlo for the $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling limit. The phase diagram is
distinctly different to that at the higher van Hove filling studied earlier,
and the difference can be attributed to the lack of particle-hole symmetry in
the band structure with respect to the Dirac point.

<h3>Charge bond order and s-wave superconductivity in the kagome lattice  with electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10458" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10458</a>
<br>
<i>Qing-Geng Yang, Meng Yao, Da Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang</i>
<p>The effects of optical bond phonons coupled to electrons in two-dimensional
lattices have attracted much interest recently, with the hope to explore
unconventional superconducting mechanism and pairing symmetries. Here we
conduct a systematic investigation of such phonon modes in the kagome lattice
at and around the upper van Hove filling, in order to unravel new effects of
the bond phonons in the presence of the unique sublattice frustration. We
combine the singular-mode functional renormalization group and the projector
determinant quantum Monte Carlo methods. At the upper van Hove filling and in
the absence of the Hubbard interaction $U$, we find there exists an s-wave
superconducting state at weaker electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ and
higher phonon frequency $\omega$, and a charge bond order (or the valence bond
solid) state at larger $\lambda$ and lower $\omega$. The Hubbard interaction
$U$ suppresses drastically the s-wave pairing, so that only the charge bond
order survives. On the other hand, upon slight doping away from the van Hove
filling, we observe that the charge bond order is suppressed due to the
breakdown of the perfect Fermi surface nesting, while the superconductivity
persists. The s-wave superconductivity and charge bond order may be relevant in
the layered kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs).

<i>Shristi Bist, Ratnesh K. Pandey, Sejal Shah, Parswajit Kalita, Amit Chawla, D. K. Avasthi</i>
<p>Tungsten carbide (WC) stands out as a crucial material for exploration in
extreme environments due to its resistance to radiation and impressive
mechanical strength. Widely utilized in cutting tools, high-wear components,
and as a potential contender for plasma-facing material in nuclear reactors,
WC's erosion behavior under surrogate irradiations is a subject of
investigation. In the present work, WC films were synthesized at two different
substrate temperatures of 400 K and 600 K using RF sputtering and were then
irradiated with 100 keV Kr1+ ions at a fluence of 1x1017 ions/cm2. The
crystalline phases of as deposited WC films were confirmed by glancing
incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. Rutherford Backscattering
Spectrometry (RBS) was employed to determine the thicknesses of pristine
samples and the sputtering rate by measuring the difference in the areal
densities of the pristine and irradiated films. The erosion rate of both types
of films was found to be ~ 1.6 atoms per incident Kr+ ion. These findings
contribute to a foundational comprehension of the radiation tolerance behavior
of WC thin films, crucial for their performance in the demanding conditions of
extreme radiation.

<h3>Pressure-Induced Split of the Density Wave Transitions in  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-Œ¥}$</h3>

<i>Rustem Khasanov, Thomas J. Hicken, Dariusz J. Gawryluk, Lo√Øc Pierre Sorel, Steffen B√∂tzel, Frank Lechermann, Ilya M. Eremin, Hubertus Luetkens, Zurab Guguchia</i>
<p>The unveiling of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under
pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave (DW)
state, has attracted considerable attention. Notably, the nature of this
competing DW order remains elusive, presenting a crucial question that demands
further investigation. Here, we employ the muon-spin rotation/relaxation
($\mu$SR) technique combined with dipole-field numerical analysis to probe the
magnetic response of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as a function of hydrostatic
pressure. At ambient pressure, $\mu$SR experiments reveal commensurate static
magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} \simeq 151$K. The comparison of the observed
internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals the magnetic
structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments
($\simeq0.3-0.7$$\mu_{\rm B}$), characterized by alternating lines of magnetic
moments and non-magnetic stripes. Experiments under pressure (up to
$p\simeq2.3$~GPa) demonstrate an increase of the magnetic ordering temperature
at a rate ${\rm d}T_{\rm N}/{\rm d}p\simeq 2.8$ K/GPa. This trend is opposite
in sign and significantly smaller in magnitude compared to the changes observed
in the DW order of unknown origin reported by Wang et al. [arXiv:2309.17378].
Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$
system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- the spin
density wave and, most likely, charge density wave -- with a notable
pressure-induced separation between them.

<p>The valence band (VB) structure of an Al0.5TiZrPdCuNi high-entropy alloy
(HEA) obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been compared to that
recently calculated by Odbadrakh et al, 2019. Both experimental and theoretical
VBs show split-band structures typical of alloys composed from the early (TE)
and late (TL) transition metals. Accordingly, several properties of this alloy
(both in the glassy and crystalline state) associated with the electronic
structure (ES), are compared with those of similar TE-TL alloys. The comparison
shows in addition to the usual dependence on the total TL content strong effect
of alloying with Al on the density of states at the Fermi level, N(EF) and on
the magnetic susceptibility of Al0.5TiZrPdCuNi HEA, which is like that of
conventional glassy alloys, such as Zr-Cu-Al ones. Despite some similarity
between the shapes of theoretical and corresponding experimental VBs there are
significant quantitative differences between them which should be taken into
account in any future studies of ES in HEAs and other compositionally complex
alloys (CCA).

<i>Qiongyao Wang, Jing Bai, Luting Xu, Wei Feng, Xin-Qi Li</i>
<p>We perform simulations for moving and non-Abelian fusion of Majorana zero
modes in topological superconducting quantum wires. We display interesting
behaviors of nonadiabatic transition associated with the moving through
mini-gate-controlled multiple-segments modulations. Owing to breaking of the
initial fermion parity induced by nonadiabatic transitions, deviation from the
standard fusion rule is analyzed. Moreover, we develop a measurement scheme to
infer the amount of fermion parity breaking and nonadiabatic transition
probability to excited states, based on the characteristic spectrum of
measurement current by a uantum-point-contact detector, in measuring the charge
occupation dynamics in a fusion-outcome-probing quantum dot.

<h3>Multiple localized-itinerant dualities in magnetism of 5f electron  systems. The case of UPt$_2$Si$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10507</a>
<br>
<i>L. M. Sandratskii, V. M. Silkin, L. Havela</i>
<p>The paper deals with the U based compound UPt$_2$Si$_2$ (UPS). The material
was first treated as a localized 5f-electron system. Later, an opposite opinion
of a predominantly itinerant nature of the system was put forward. The most
recent publications treat UPS as a dual material. We suggest a material
specific theoretical model based on the density functional theory plus Hubbard
$U$ (DFT+$U$) calculations that describes the set of fundamental ground-state
properties and high magnetic field experiment. The ground state properties
include antiferromagnetic magnetic structure, magnetic easy axis, and the value
of the U atomic moment. The in-field experiment shows the presence of a strong
metamagnetic transition for the field parallel to the easy axis in contrast to
the hard field direction where such a feature is absent. On the other hand,
comparable induced magnetization values are obtained for both easy and hard
field directions. Within the framework of the suggested model we show that the
compound possesses well-formed atomic moments built by electrons treated as
delocalized. To understand the experimental high-field properties we estimate
exchange energy, magnetic anisotropy energy, and Zeeman energy. All three
energies are shown to have comparable values what is crucial for the
interpretation of the experiment. At all steps of the study we devote special
attention to revealing and emphasizing the dual itinerant-localized properties
of the material. The obtained forms of the duality are different: well defined
atomic moments formed by the itinerant electrons, interplay of the single-site
and two-site anisotropies, strong localization of two of the 5f electrons in
contrast to the itinerant nature of the 5f electrons contributing to the states
around the Fermi level.

<i>Vit Jakubsky, Kevin Zelaya</i>
<p>We introduce a systematic method to spectrally design quasi-one-dimensional
crystal models described by the Dirac equation in the low-energy regime. The
method is based on the supersymmetric transformation applied to an initially
known pseudo-spin-1/2 model. This allows extending the corresponding susy
partner so that the new model describes a pseudo-spin-1 system. The spectral
design allows the introduction of a flat-band and discrete energies at will
into the new model. The results are illustrated in two examples where the
Su-Schriefer-Heeger chain is locally converted into a stub lattice.

<h3>Nonlinear optics driven magnetism reorientation in semiconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10518" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10518</a>
<br>
<i>Qianqian Xue, Yan Sun, Jian Zhou</i>
<p>Based on nonlinear optics, we develop a band theory to elucidate how light
could manipulate magnetization, which is rooted by the quantum geometric
structure and topological nature of electronic wavefunctions. Their existence
are determined by the light polarization and specific material symmetry, based
on the magnetic group theory. In general, both circularly and linearly
polarized light could exert an effective magnetic field and torque effect, to
reorient the magnetization. They are contributed by spin and orbital angular
momenta simultaneously. Aided by group theory and first-principles
calculations, we illustrate this theory using a showcase example of monolayer
NiCl2, showing that light irradiation effectively generates an out-of-plane
effective magnetic torque, which lifts its in-plane easy magnetization.
According to magnetic dynamic simulations, the in-plane magnetization could be
switched to the out-of-plane direction in a few nanoseconds under a modest
light intensity, demonstrating its ultrafast nature desirable for quantum
manipulation.

<br>
<i>Lea Fernandez, Siegfried Hess, Sabine H.L. Klapp</i>
<p>We discuss the two-dimensional motion of a Brownian particle that is confined
to a harmonic trap and driven by a shear flow. The surrounding medium induces
memory effects modelled by a linear, typically nonreciprocal coupling of the
particle coordinates to an auxiliary (hidden) variable. The system's behavior
resulting from the microscopic Langevin equations for the three variables is
analyzed by means of exact moment equations derived from the Fokker-Planck
representation, and numerical Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations. Increasing
the shear rate beyond a critical value we observe, for suitable coupling
scenarios with nonreciprocal elements, a transition from a stationary to an
instationary state, corresponding to an escape from the trap. We analyze this
behavior, analytically and numerically, in terms of the associated moments of
the probability distribution, and from the perspective of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. Intriguingly, the entropy production rate remains finite when
crossing the stability threshold.

<p>We study the low-field ground-state (GS) properties of the antiferromagnetic
transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions (afLRTFIM) on the
triangular lattice. We use the method of perturbative continuous unitary
transformations (pCUT) to derive an effective model for the degenerate GS space
of the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour (NN) Ising model on a finite system,
by treating the transverse-field (TF) and the long-range interactions (LRI) as
a perturbation. We determine a level-crossing between the plain stripe phase at
small TF and the clock-ordered phase at intermediate TF at $h\cong0.129$ for
$\alpha=6$, $N=36$ spins in order three perturbation theory. We discuss the
qualitative layout of the quantum phase diagram of the afLRTFIM on the

<i>Adam Olejniczak, Yury Rakovich, Victor Krivenkov</i>
<p>The Nobel Prizes in Physics (2022) and Chemistry (2023) heralded the
recognition of quantum information science and the synthesis of quantum dots,
respectively. This acknowledgment has propelled colloidal quantum dots and
perovskite nanocrystals to the forefront of quantum technologies. Their
distinct emission properties, facilitating the efficient generation of both
single photons and photon pairs, render them particularly captivating.
Moreover, their adaptability to diverse structures, ranging from traditional
electronics to nanopatterned frameworks, underscores their pivotal role in
shaping quantum technologies. Despite notable strides in synthesis, certain
properties require refinement for enhanced applicability in quantum
information, encompassing emission brightness, stability, single photon
indistinguishability, and entanglement fidelity of photon pairs. Here we offer
an overview of recent achievements in plasmon-exciton quantum emitters based on
luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals. Emphasizing the utilization of the
light-matter coupling phenomenon, we explore how this interaction enables the
manipulation of quantum properties without altering the chemical structure of
the emitters. This approach addresses critical aspects for quantum information
applications, offering precise control over emission rate, intensity, and
energy. The development of these hybrid systems represents a significant stride
forward, demonstrating their potential to overcome existing challenges and
advance the integration of quantum emitters into cutting-edge quantum
technology applications.

<i>Subhajit Sarkar, Pratim Banerjee, Molly De Raychaudhury</i>
<p>We report here perhaps the first successful synthesis and structural
characterization of the n=3 family member of Tin+1AlCn, i. e. Ti4AlC3. X-ray
Powder diffraction (XRD) data shows characteristic reflections of from
corresponding to reflections from the (002), (004), (006), (008), (100), (102),
(104), (0010), (105), (106), (0012), (1011) and (1012) planes at 2{\theta}
=7.640, 15.170, 22.760, 30.50, 350, 37.40 38.30, 39.20, 41.30, 46.220, 55.240,
58.620 and 60.780 (double structure) respectively. Rietveld refinement of the
XRD data reveals a phase purity of about 79 % for alpha-Ti4AlC3, 15 % for
beta-Ti4AlC3 and the rest mostly that of cubic TiC (6 %). The primary crystal
symmetry of the two dominant phases is the hexagonal P63/mmc. The precursors
chosen were TiH2, Al metal powder and Carbon powder in a molar ratio of
3:1.2:2, which build the case for an Al-deficient condition. We adopted the
pressureless sintering technique at 13500 C with a dwelling time of 4 hours
under ultra-high vacuum of 10-7 mbar. The co-existence of trace amount of
Ti2AlC at 1350 deg C is proven by the small structure at 2{\theta}=13.130. No
trace of oxides like Al2O3 or TiO2 was found in the end product. The line
profile width of XRD data indicates average grain size of the order of micro
meter. The Scanning Electron Microscopy images show highly lamellar stacked
growth of almost a pure MAX (alpha or beta) phase and grain size of micron
order, agreeing well with the XRD data.

<h3>Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional  Active Crystals and Glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10625" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10625</a>
<br>
<i>Subhodeep Dey, Antik Bhattacharya, Smarajit Karmakar</i>
<p>In the realm of two-dimensional (2D) systems, the renowned Mermin-Wagner
effect plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects
marked by far-reaching density fluctuations and the divergence of various
dynamic properties. This effect also unequivocally negates the possibility of
stable crystalline phases in 2D particulate systems characterized by continuous
degrees of freedom. This effect has been recently discerned in glass-forming
liquids, displaying characteristic signatures like the logarithmic divergence
of mean squared displacement in the plateau regime. We explored these
long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline solids and in glass-forming liquids
in the presence of non-equilibrium active forces. These systems are known in
the literature as active crystals and glasses, and they can be thought of as a
minimalistic model for understanding various non-equilibrium systems where the
constituent particles dynamics are controlled by both temperature and other
active forces, which can be external or internal. Such models often offer
valuable insights into the dynamical behavior of biological systems, such as
collections of cells, bacteria, ant colonies, or even synthetic self-propelled
particles like Janus colloids. Our study reveals that fluctuations stemming
from active forces get strongly coupled with long wavelength fluctuations
arising from thermal effects, resulting in dramatic dynamical effects,
particularly in 2D systems. We also shed light on how these fluctuations impact
dynamical heterogeneity, a defining characteristic of glassy dynamics.

<p>The functionality of materials is determined by their composition and
microstructure, that is, the distribution and orientation of crystalline
grains, grain boundaries and the defects within them. The characterisation of
the material's microstructure is therefore critical for materials applications
such as catalysis, energy storage and buildings. Until now, characterization
techniques that map the distribution of grains, their orientation, and the
presence of defects have either been limited to surface investigations, to
spatial resolutions of a few hundred nanometres, or to systems of thickness
around one hundred nanometres, thus requiring destructive sample preparation
for measurements and preventing the study of system-representative volumes or
the investigation of materials under operational conditions. Here, we present
X-ray linear dichroic orientation tomography, a quantitative, non-invasive
technique that allows for an intra- and inter-granular characterisation of
extended polycrystalline and amorphous materials in three dimensions (3D). We
present the detailed characterisation of a polycrystalline sample of vanadium
pentoxide (V2O5), a key catalyst in the production of sulfuric acid. In
addition to determining the nanoscale composition, we map the crystal
orientation throughout the polycrystalline sample with 73 nm spatial
resolution. We identify grains, as well as twist, tilt, and twin grain
boundaries. We further observe the creation and annihilation of topological
defects promoted by the presence of volume crystallographic defects in 3D. Our
method's non-destructive and spectroscopic nature opens the door to in-operando
combined chemical and microstructural investigations of functional materials,
including energy and mechanical materials in existing industries, as well as
quantum materials for future technologies.

<p>In situ Eu-doped {ZnCdO/ZnO}30 multilayer systems were grown on p-type
Si-substrates and on quartz substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam
epitaxy. Various Eu concentrations in the samples were achieved by controlling
temperature of the europium effusion cell. The properties of as-grown and
annealed {ZnCdO/ZnO}30:Eu multilayers were investigated using secondary ion
mass spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray diffraction methods. SIMS measurements
showed that annealing at 700{\deg}C and 900{\deg}C practically did not change
the Eu concentration and the rare earth depth profiles are uniform. It was
found that the band gap depends on the concentration of Eu and it was changed
by rapid thermal annealing. Varshni and Bose-Einstein equations were used to
describe the temperature dependence of the band gap of {ZnCdO/ZnO}30:Eu
multilayer structures and Debye and Einstein temperatures were obtained.

<h3>A Gauss-Newton method for iterative optimization of memory kernels for  generalized Langevin thermostats in coarse-grained molecular dynamics  simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10652" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10652</a>
<br>
<i>V. Klippenstein, N. Wolf, N. F. A. van der Vegt</i>
<p>In molecular dynamics simulations, dynamically consistent coarse-grained (CG)
models commonly use stochastic thermostats to model friction and fluctuations
that are lost in a CG description. While Markovian, i.e., time-local,
formulations of such thermostats allow for an accurate representation of
diffusivities/long-time dynamics, a correct description of the dynamics on all
time scales generally requires non-Markovian, i.e., non-time-local,
thermostats. These thermostats are typically of the form of a Generalized
Langevin Equation (GLE) determined by a memory kernel. In this work, we use a
Markovian embedded formulation of a position-independent GLE thermostat acting
independently on each CG degree of freedom. Extracting the memory kernel of
this CG model from atomistic reference data requires several approximations.
Therefore, this task is easiest understood as an inverse problem. While our
recently proposed approximate Newton scheme (IOMK) allows for the iterative
optimization of a memory kernel, Markovian embedding remained potentially
error-prone and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a
Gauss-Newton scheme (IOMK-GN) based on IOMK, which allows for a direct
parameterization of a Markovian embedded model.

<h3>Human-machine collaboration: ordering mechanism of rank$-2$ spin liquid  on breathing pyrochlore lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10658</a>
<br>
<i>Nicolas Sadoune, Ke Liu, Han Yan, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert, Nic Shannon, Lode Pollet</i>
<p>Machine learning algorithms thrive on large data sets of good quality. Here
we show that they can also excel in a typical research setting with little data
of limited quality, through an interplay of insights coming from machine, and
human researchers. The question we address is the unsolved problem of ordering
out of a spin-liquid phase described by an emergent rank-2 $U(1)$ gauge theory,
as described by [H. Yan it et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 127203 (2020)].
Published Monte Carlo simulations for this problem are consistent with a strong
first-order phase transition, out of the R2-U1 spin liquid, but were too noisy
for the form of low-temperature order to be identified. Using a
highly-interpretable machine learning approach based on a support vector
machine with a tensorial kernel (TKSVM), we re-analyze this Monte Carlo data,
gaining new information about the form of order that could in turn be
interpreted by traditionally-trained physicists. We find that the
low-temperature ordered phase is a form of hybrid nematic order with emergent
$Z_2$ symmetry, which allows for a sub-extensive set of domain walls at zero
energy. This complex form of order arises due to a subtle thermal
order-by-disorder mechanism, that can be understood from the fluctuations of
the tensor electric field of the parent rank-2 gauge theory. These results were
obtained by a back-and-forth process which closely resembles a collaboration
between human researchers and machines. We argue that this "collaborative"
approach may provide a blueprint for solving other problems that have not
yielded to human insights alone.

<h3>Considerations on the relaxation time in shear-driven jamming</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10682</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas Hedstr√∂m, Peter Olsson</i>
<p>We study the jamming transition in a model of elastic particles under shear
at zero temperature, with a focus on the relaxation time $\tau_1$. This
relaxation time is from two-step simulations where the first step is the
ordinary shearing simulation and the second step is the relaxation of the
energy after stopping the shearing. $\tau_1$ is determined from the final
exponential decay of the energy. Such relaxations are done with many different
starting configuration generated by a long shearing simulation in which the
shear varible $\gamma$ slowly increases. We study the correlations of both
$\tau_1$, determined from the decay, and the pressure, $p_1$, from the starting
configurations as a function of the difference in $\gamma$. We find that the
correlations of $p_1$ are more long lived than the ones of $\tau_1$ and find
that the reason for this is that the individual $\tau_1$ is controlled both by
$p_1$ of the starting configuration and a random contribution which depends on
the relaxation path length -- the average distance moved by the particles
during the relaxation. We further conclude that it is $\gammatau$, determined
from the correlations of $\tau_1$, which is the relevant one when the aim is to
generate data that may be used for determining the critical exponent that
characterizes the jamming transition.

<i>Takahiro Uto, Daigo Oue</i>
<p>We study parametric instability in a magnomechanical system, specifically
examining magnon tunneling between moving ferromagnetic insulators. Our
analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a
critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold
at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and
Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent,
linked to the PT-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could
offer sensitive measurements and signal amplification in quantum technology.

<h3>Magneto-Permeability Effect in Ferrofluid Flow through Porous Media  studied via Multiparticle Collision Dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Patrick Ilg</i>
<p>As more and more promising applications of magnetic nanoparticles in
complicated environments are explored, their flow properties in porous media
are of increasing interest. We here propose a hybrid approach based on the
Multiparticle Collision Dynamics Method extended to porous media via friction
forces and coupled with Brownian Dynamics simulations of the rotational motion
of magnetic nanoparticles' magnetic moment. We simulate flow in planar channels
homogeneously filled with a porous medium and verify our implementation by
reproducing the analytical velocity profile of the Darcy-Brinkman model in the
non-magnetic case. In the presence of an externally applied magnetic field, the
non-equilibrium magnetization and friction forces lead to field-dependent
velocity profiles that result in effective, field-dependent permeabilities. We
provide a theoretical expression for this magneto-permeability effect in
analogy with the magneto-viscous effect. Finally, we study the flow through
planar channels, where only the walls are covered with a porous medium. We find
a smooth crossover from the Poiseuille profile in the center of the channel to
the Brinkman-Darcy flow in the porous layers. We propose a simple estimate of
the thickness of the porous layer based on the flow rate and maximum flow
velocity.

<h3>Non-collinear first-principles studies of the spin-electric coupling in  frustrated triangular molecular magnets</h3>

<br>
<i>M. F. Islam, Kushantha P. K. Withanage, C. M. Canali, Mark R. Pederson</i>
<p>Frustrated triangular molecular magnets (MMs) with anti-ferromagnetic ground
states (GS) are an important class of magnetic systems with potential
applications in quantum information processing. The two-fold degenerate GS of
these molecules, characterized by spin chirality, can be utilized to encode
qubits for quantum computing. Furthermore, because of the lack of inversion
symmetry in these molecules, an electric field couples directly states of
opposite chirality, allowing a very efficient and fast control of the qubits.
In this work we present a theoretical method to calculate the spin-electric
coupling for triangular MMs with effective {\it local} spins $s$ larger than
1/2, which is amenable to a first-principles implementation based on density
functional theory (DFT). In contrast to MMs where the net magnetization at the
magnetic atoms is $\mu_{\rm B}/2$ ($\mu_{\rm B} $ is the Bohr magneton), the
DFT treatment of frustrated triangular MMs with larger local magnetizations
requires a fully non-collinear approach, which we have implemented in the
NRLMOL DFT code. As an example, we have used these methods to evaluate the
spin-electric coupling for a spin $s = 5/2$ $\{\mathrm{Fe_3}\}$ triangular MM,
where this effect has been observed experimentally for the first time quite
recently. Our theoretical and computational methods will help elucidate and
further guide ongoing experimental work in the field of quantum molecular
spintronics.

<p>The extraordinary quantum properties of nonequilibrium systems governed by
dissipative dynamics have become a focal point in contemporary scientific
inquiry. The Nonequilibrium Green's Functions (NEGF) theory provides a
versatile method for addressing driven {\em non-dissipative} systems, utilizing
the powerful diagrammatic technique to incorporate correlation effects. We here
present a second-quantization approach to the {\em dissipative} NEGF theory,
reformulating Keldysh ideas to accommodate Lindbladian dynamics and extending
the Kadanoff-Baym equations accordingly. Generalizing diagrammatic perturbation
theory for many-body Lindblad operators, the formalism enables correlated and

<h3>Stressed and sliding ice surfaces liquefy without much heating</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10843</a>
<br>
<i>Achraf Atila, Sergey V. Sukhomlinov, Martin H. M√ºser</i>
<p>The low kinetic friction observed between ice or snow and numerous
counterbodies is commonly attributed to a thin interfacial water layer [1-3],
which is believed to exist because of pressure melting [4], surface melting [5,
6], or friction-induced heating [7]. However, even the currently leading theory
of frictional melting keeps being challenged, for example, due to the lack of
detectable warming of snow surfaces under a rotating slider at -7{\deg}C
temperature and 1 m/s sliding velocity despite high temporospatial resolution
[8]. Here we present molecular simulations of ice interfaces that reveal that
ice surfaces liquefy readily without melting thermally but rather by
displacement driven amorphization, normal-stress gradients, and tensile
in-plane stress. Yet, friction coefficients below 0.01, as observed during the
sliding of hydrophobic solids over ice [9], appear possible only when the
counterfaces are smooth and allow water to slip past them. Our findings provide
fundamental guidelines on how to optimize ice friction and challenge
experimentalists to measure the surface temperature of ice and snow at minute
scales and with unprecedented speed.

<p>We show that the momentum-dependent scaling exponents of the holographic
fermion self-energy of the conformal-to-AdS$_2$ Gubser-Rocha model can describe
new findings from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments on a
single layer (Pb,Bi)$_{2}$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ copper-oxide. In
particular, it was recently observed, in high-precision measurements on
constant energy cuts along the nodal direction, that the spectral function
departs from the Lorentzian line shape that is expected from the
power-law-liquid model of a nodal self-energy, with an imaginary part
featureless in momentum as $\Sigma''_{\text{PLL}}(\omega) \propto
(\omega^2)^\alpha$. By direct comparison with experimental results, we provide
evidence that this departure from either a Fermi liquid or the power-law
liquid, resulting in an asymmetry of the spectral function as a function of
momentum around the central peak, is captured at low temperature and all
dopings by a semi-holographic model that predicts a momentum-dependent scaling
exponent in the electron self-energy as $\Sigma(\omega,k) \propto \omega
(-\omega^2)^{\alpha (1 - (k - k_F)/k_F) - 1/2}$, with $\hbar k_F$ the Fermi
momentum.

<p>Topological magnetic insulators host chiral gapless edge modes. In the
presence of strong interaction effects, the spin of these modes may
fractionalize. Studying a 2D array of coupled insulating spin-1/2 chains, we
show how spatially modulated magnetic fields and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions can be exploited to realize chiral spin liquids or integer and
fractional spin quantum Hall effect phases. These are characterized by a gapped
bulk spectrum and gapless chiral edge modes with fractional spin. The spin
fractionalization is manifested in the quantized spin conductance, which can be
used to probe the fractional spin quantum Hall effect. We analyze the system
via bosonization and perturbative renormalization group techniques that allow
us to identify the most relevant terms induced by the spin-spin interactions
that open gaps and render the system topological under well-specified resonance
conditions. We show explicitly that the emerging phase is a genuine chiral spin
liquid. We suggest that the phases can be realized experimentally in synthetic
spin chains and ultracold atom systems.

<p>We explore the dynamics of a simple liquid whose particles, in addition to
standard potential-based interactions, are also subjected to transverse forces
preserving the Boltzmann distribution. We derive the effective dynamics of one
and two tracer particles in the infinite-dimensional limit. We determine the
amount of acceleration of the dynamics caused by the transverse forces, in
particular in the vicinity of the glass transition. We analyze the emergence
and evolution of odd transport phenomena induced by the transverse forces.

<p>Despite extensive research on magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions, a
significant challenge remains in crafting nontrivial high-order skyrmionic
textures with varying, or even tailor-made, topologies. We address this
challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionics metamaterial
within a monolayer thin film and suggest several promising lattice-like,
flakes-like, and cell-like skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly
stable. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled
assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for
positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing
for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput
atomistic-spin-dynamic (ASD) simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven
tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions
(Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic
building blocks' to forming reported intricate textures. In this work, two key
contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we
present a novel method for integrating control assembly protocols for the
stabilization and investigation of topological magnets, which marks a
significant advancement in the ability to explore new skyrmionic textures.
Second, we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials, which shows a
plethora of complex topologies that are possible to investigate theoretically
and experimentally.

<h3>A model of non-Fermi liquid with power law resistivity: strange metal  with a not-so-strange origin</h3>

<p>We construct a model which exhibits resistivity going as a power law in
temperature $T$, as $T^\alpha$ down to the lowest temperature. There is no
residual resistivity because we assume the absence of disorder and momentum
relaxation is due to umklapp scattering. Our model consists of a quantum spin
liquid state with spinon Fermi surface and a hole Fermi surface made out of
doped holes. The key ingredient is a set of singular $2k_F$ modes living on a
ring in momentum space. Depending on parameters, $\alpha$ may be unity (strange
metal) or even smaller. The model may be applicable to a doped organic
compound, which has been found to exhibit linear T resistivity. We conclude
that it is possible to obtain strange metal behavior starting with a model
which is not so strange.
