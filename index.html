<h3>Enhanced hydrodynamic diffusion in dense binary active suspensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09448</a>
<br>
<i>Zhouyang Ge, Shervin Bagheri, Gwynn J. Elfring</i>
<p>Active suspensions, fluids loaded with energy-injecting microswimmers such as
cells or microrobots, have potential applications in diverse areas ranging from
energy to sustainability and health. Here, we study the effect of incorporating
passive particles into a dense suspension of active ones. Specifically, we
focus on individually immotile active particles, or shakers, whose collective
dynamics arise from the activity-induced many-body interactions. In the absence
of Brownian motion, both active and passive particles fluctuate vigorously in
space, displaying pronounced hydrodynamic diffusion. The rotational diffusivity
of all particles decreases monotonically with the amount of passive ones;
however, surprisingly, the translational diffusivity is non-monotonic and can
be significantly enhanced. This suggests a hydrodynamic coupling of the two
dynamics, which we find are attributed to a local ordering of the active
particles under their hydrodynamic interactions. Using a toy model where
passive particles are treated as defects in a lattice of aligned force dipoles,
or stresslets, we reveal a simple mechanism by which spatial correlations and
inactivity give rise to enhanced diffusion. Our results uncover an unexpected
effect of passive particles on the dynamics of active suspensions, providing
new possibilities to enhance mixing and control mass transport in active
fluids.

<p>Open dissipative systems of quantum fluids have been well studied
numerically. In view of a complementary analytical description we extend here
the variational optimization method for Bose-Einstein condensates of closed
systems to open-dissipative condensates. The resulting projection optimization
method is applied to a complex Gross-Pitaevski equation, which models
phenomenologically a photon Bose-Einstein condensate. Together with known
methods from hydrodynamics we obtain an approximate vortex solution, which

<h3>Polaronic mechanism of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in Hubbard models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09279" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09279</a>
<br>
<i>Rhine Samajdar, R. N. Bhatt</i>
<p>The search for elusive Nagaoka-type ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has
recently enjoyed renewed attention with the advent of a variety of experimental
platforms enabling its realization, including moir\'e materials, quantum dots,
and ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate a universal
mechanism for Nagaoka ferromagnetism (that applies to both bipartite and
nonbipartite lattices) based on the formation of ferromagnetic polarons
consisting of a dopant dressed with polarized spins. Using large-scale
density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we present a comprehensive
study of the ferromagnetic polaron in an electron-doped Hubbard model,
establishing various polaronic properties such as its size and energetics.
Moreover, we systematically probe the internal structure of the magnetic
state$\unicode{x2014}$through the use of pinning fields and three-point
spin-charge-spin correlation functions$\unicode{x2014}$for both the
single-polaron limit and the high-density regime of interacting polarons. Our
results highlight the crucial role of mobile polarons in the birth of global
ferromagnetic order from local ferromagnetism and provide a unified framework
to understand the development and demise of the Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic
state across dopings.

<h3>Kagome Materials II: SG 191: FeGe as a LEGO Building Block for the  Entire 1:6:6 series: hidden d-orbital decoupling of flat band sectors,  effective models and interaction Hamiltonians</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09290" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09290</a>
<br>
<i>Yi Jiang, Haoyu Hu, Dumitru Călugăru, Claudia Felser, Santiago Blanco-Canosa, Hongming Weng, Yuanfeng Xu, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<p>The electronic structure and interactions of kagome materials such as 1:1
(FeGe class) and 1:6:6 (MgFe$_6$Ge$_6$ class) are complicated and involve many
orbitals and bands at the Fermi level. Current theoretical models treat the
systems in an $s$-orbital kagome representation, unsuited and incorrect both
quantitatively and qualitatively to the material realities. In this work, we
lay the basis of a faithful framework of the electronic model for this large
class of materials. We show that the complicated ``spaghetti" of electronic
bands near the Fermi level can be decomposed into three groups of $d$-Fe
orbitals coupled to specific Ge orbitals. Such decomposition allows for a clear
analytical understanding (leading to different results than the simple
$s$-orbital kagome models) of the flat bands in the system based on the
$S$-matrix formalism of generalized bipartite lattices. Our three minimal
Hamiltonians can reproduce the quasi-flat bands, van Hove singularities,
topology, and Dirac points close to the Fermi level, which we prove by
extensive ab initio studies. We also obtain the interacting Hamiltonian of $d$
orbitals in FeGe using the constraint random phase approximation (cRPA) method.
We then use this as a fundamental ``LEGO"-like building block for a large
family of 1:6:6 kagome materials, which can be obtained by doubling and
perturbing the FeGe Hamiltonian. We applied the model to its kagome siblings
FeSn and CoSn, and also MgFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our work serves as the first complete
framework for the study of the interacting phase diagram of kagome compounds.

<h3>Hamiltonian Reconstruction: the Correlation Matrix and Incomplete  Operator Bases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09302</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas Z. Brito, Stephen Carr, J. Alexander Jacoby, J. B. Marston</i>
<p>We explore the robustness of the correlation matrix Hamiltonian
reconstruction technique with respect to the choice of operator basis, studying
the effects of bases that are undercomplete and over-complete -- too few or too
many operators respectively. An approximation scheme for reconstructing from an
undercomplete basis is proposed and performed numerically on select models. We
discuss the confounding effects of conserved quantities and symmetries on
reconstruction attempts. We apply these considerations to a variety of
one-dimensional systems in zero- and finite-temperature regimes.

<h3>First-order effect of electron-electron interactions on the anomalous  Hall conductivity of massive Dirac fermions</h3>

<br>
<i>Daria A. Dumitriu-I., Darius A. Deaconu, Alexander E. Kazantsev, Alessandro Principi</i>
<p>We investigate the first-order correction to the anomalous Hall conductivity
of 2D massive Dirac fermions arising from electron-electron interactions. In a
fully gapped system in the limit of zero temperature, we find that this
correction vanishes, confirming the absence of perturbative corrections to the
topological Hall conductivity. At finite temperature or chemical potential, we
find that the total Hall response decays faster than in the non-interacting
case, depending on the strength of electron-electron interactions. These
features, which could potentially be observed experimentally, show the
importance of two-body interactions for anomalous Hall transport.

<h3>Amplitude Higgs mode in superconductors with magnetic impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09310" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09310</a>
<br>
<i>Yantao Li, Maxim Dzero</i>
<p>We study nonlinear response of conventional superconducting alloys with weak
magnetic impurities to an external alternating electromagnetic field. In
particular, we calculate a correction to superconducting order parameter up to
the second order in external vector potential. We show that frequency
dependence of the order parameter amplitude has characteristic resonant shape
with a maximum at frequency which is smaller than twice the magnitude of the
pairing amplitude in equilibrium and at the same time exceeds the
single-particle threshold energy. Our results suggest that in the presence of
magnetic impurities the dynamics of the pairing amplitude in the collisionless
regime will remain robust with respect to dissipative processes. We also
evaluate the third harmonic contribution to the current as a function of the
probe frequency and for various concentrations of magnetic impurities.

<h3>Physical models of traffic safety at crossings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09318</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Leich, Ronald Nippold, Andreas Schadschneider, Peter Wagner</i>
<p>Traffic safety at intersections is studied quantitatively using methods from
Statistical Mechanics on the basis of simple microscopic traffic flow models.
In order to determine a relationship between traffic flow and the number of
crashes, the modelling focus is on the building block of any road network,
namely the crossing of two streams. In this paper, it is shown that the number
of crossing conflicts is proportional to the product of the two traffic flows
from which a simple model is developed. This model substantiates known
empirical findings. Since real crash data are obtained by an involved process
from such building blocks, there is a difference between the theoretical and
empirical results. This process is modelled here as well and narrows the gap
between theory and observation.

<h3>Force-induced desorption of copolymeric comb polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09320" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09320</a>
<br>
<i>EJ Janse van Rensburg, CE Soteros, SG Whittington</i>
<p>We investigate a lattice model of comb copolymers that can adsorb at a
surface and that are subject to a force causing desorption. The teeth and the
backbone of the comb are chemically distinct and can interact differently with
the surface. That is, the strength of the surface interaction can be different
for the monomers in the teeth and in the backbone. We consider several cases
including (i) the uniform case where the number of teeth is fixed and the
lengths of the branches in the backbone and the lengths of the teeth are all
identical, (ii) the case where the teeth are short compared to the branches in
the backbone, (iii) the situation where the teeth are long compared to the
backbone, and (iv) the case where the number of teeth approaches infinity. We
determine the free energies in the thermodynamic limit and discuss the nature
of the phase diagrams of the model.

<h3>Unified physical framework for stretched-exponential,  compressed-exponential, and logarithmic relaxation phenomena in glassy  polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09321</a>
<br>
<i>Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Oleg V. Gendelman, Alessio Zaccone</i>
<p>We develop a simple yet comprehensive nonlinear model to describe relaxation
phenomena in amorphous glass-formers near the glass transition temperature. The
model is based on the two-state, two-(time)scale (TS2) framework, and describes
the isothermal relaxation of specific volume, enthalpy, or shear stress via a
simple first-order nonlinear differential equation (the Trachenko-Zaccone [TZ]
equation) for local cooperative events. These nonlinear dynamics of
cooperatively rearranging regions (CRR) naturally arise from the TS2 framework.
We demonstrate that the solutions of the TZ equation comprehensively encompass
the Debye exponential relaxation, the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) stretched
and compressed relaxations, and the Guiu-Pratt logarithmic relaxation.
Furthermore, for the case of stress relaxation modeling, our model recovers, as
one of its limits, the Eyring law for plastic flow, where the Eyring activation
volume is related to thermodynamic parameters of the material. Using the
example of polystyrene (PS), we demonstrate how our model successfully
describes the Kovacs "asymmetry of approach" specific volume and enthalpy
experiments, as well as the stress relaxation. Other potential applications of
the model, including the dielectric relaxation, are also discussed. The
presented approach disentangles the physical origins of different relaxation
laws within a single general framework based on the underlying physics.

<h3>Exotic magnetic anisotropy near digitized dimensional Mott boundary</h3>

<br>
<i>Seung Gyo Jeong, Jihyun Kim, Taewon Min, Sehwan Song, Jin Young Oh, Woo-suk Noh, Sungkyun Park, Tuson Park, Jong Mok Ok, Jaekwang Lee, Woo Seok Choi</i>
<p>The magnetic anisotropy of low-dimensional Mott systems exhibits unexpected
magnetotransport behavior useful for spin-based quantum electronics. Yet, the
anisotropy of natural materials is inherently determined by the crystal
structure, highly limiting its engineering. We demonstrate the magnetic
anisotropy modulation near a digitized dimensional Mott boundary in artificial
superlattices composed of a correlated magnetic monolayer SrRuO3 and
nonmagnetic SrTiO3. The magnetic anisotropy is initially engineered by
modulating the interlayer coupling strength between the magnetic monolayers.
Interestingly, when the interlayer coupling strength is maximized, a nearly
degenerate state is realized, in which the anisotropic magnetotransport is
strongly influenced by both the thermal and magnetic energy scales. Our results
offer a new digitized control for magnetic anisotropy in low-dimensional Mott
systems, inspiring promising integration of Mottronics and spintronics.

<h3>Dimensional reduction from magnetic field in moiré superlattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Nisarga Paul, Philip J.D. Crowley, Liang Fu</i>
<p>Moir\'e materials provide a highly tunable platform in which novel electronic
phenomena can emerge. We study strained moir\'e materials in a uniform magnetic
field and predict highly anisotropic electrical conductivity which switches
easy-axis as magnetic field or strain is varied. The dramatic anisotropy
reflects one-dimensional localization (dimensional reduction) of the electron
wavefunctions along a crystal axis due to quantum interference effects. This
can be understood in an effective one-dimensional quasiperiodic
Aubry-Andr\'e-like models, or in a complementary semiclassical picture. This
phenomenon should be observable in strained moir\'e materials at realistic
fields and low strain disorder, as well as unstrained systems with anisotropic
Fermi surfaces.

<p>From lithium-ion batteries to high-temperature superconductors, oxide
materials have been widely used in electronic devices. However, demands of
future technologies require materials beyond oxides, as anion chemistries
distinct from oxygen can expand the palette of mechanisms and phenomena, to
achieve superior functionalities. Examples include nitride-based wide bandgap
semiconductors and halide perovskite solar cells, with MAPbBr3 being a
representation revolutionizing photovoltaics research. Here, we demonstrate
magnetoelectric behaviour in quasi-two-dimensional halides (K,Rb)3Mn2Cl7
through simultaneous thermal control of electric and magnetic polarizations by
exploiting a polar-to-antipolar displacive transition. Additionally, our
calculations indicate a possible polarization switching path including a strong
magnetoelectric coupling, indicating halides can be excellent platforms to
design future multiferroic and ferroelectric devices. We expect our findings to
broaden the exploration of multiferroics to non-oxide materials and open access
to novel mechanisms, beyond conventional electric/magnetic control, for
coupling ferroic orders.

<h3>Proximity-induced gapless superconductivity in two-dimensional Rashba  semiconductor in magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09347" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09347</a>
<br>
<i>Serafim S. Babkin, Andrew P. Higginbotham, Maksym Serbyn</i>
<p>Two-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures form the
foundation of numerous nanoscale physical systems. However, measuring the
properties of such heterostructures, and characterizing the semiconductor
in-situ is challenging. A recent experimental study [arXiv:2107.03695] was able
to probe the semiconductor within the heterostructure using microwave
measurements of the superfluid density. This work revealed a rapid depletion of
superfluid density in semiconductor, caused by the in-plane magnetic field
which in presence of spin-orbit coupling creates so-called Bogoliubov Fermi
surfaces. The experimental work used a simplified theoretical model that
neglected the presence of non-magnetic disorder in the semiconductor, hence
describing the data only qualitatively. Motivated by experiments, we introduce
a theoretical model describing a disordered semiconductor with strong
spin-orbit coupling that is proximitized by a superconductor. Our model
provides specific predictions for the density of states and superfluid density.
Presence of disorder leads to the emergence of a gapless superconducting phase,
that may be viewed as a manifestation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface. When applied
to real experimental data, our model showcases excellent quantitative
agreement, enabling the extraction of material parameters such as mean free
path and mobility, and estimating $g$-tensor after taking into account the
orbital contribution of magnetic field. Our model can be used to probe in-situ
parameters of other superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and can be
further extended to give access to transport properties.

<h3>Rotational dynamics, ionic conductivity, and glass formation in a  ZnCl2-based deep eutectic solvent</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09360" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09360</a>
<br>
<i>A. Schulz, P. Lunkenheimer, A. Loidl</i>
<p>Glass formation and reorientational motions are widespread, but
often-neglected features of deep eutectic solvents, although both can be
relevant for the technically important ionic conductivity at room temperature.
Here we investigate these properties for two mixtures of ethylene glycol and
ZnCl2, which were recently considered as superior electrolyte materials for
application in zinc-ion batteries. For this purpose, we employed dielectric
spectroscopy performed in a broad temperature range, extending from the
supercooled state at low temperatures up to the liquid phase around room
temperature and beyond. We find evidence for a relaxation process arising from
dipolar reorientation dynamics, which reveals the clear signatures of glassy
freezing. This freezing also governs the temperature dependence of the ionic dc
conductivity. We compare the obtained results with those for deep eutectic
solvents that are formed by the same hydrogen-bond donor, ethylene glycol, but
by two different salts, choline chloride and lithium triflate. The four
materials reveal significantly different ionic and reorientational dynamics.
Moreover, we find varying degrees of decoupling of rotational dipolar and
translational ionic motions, which partly can be described by a fractional
Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation. The typical glass-forming properties of these
solvents strongly affect their room-temperature conductivity.

<h3>Possible Topological Superconductivity in a Topological Crystalline  Insulator (Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$)$_{1-y}$In$_y$Te</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09368</a>
<br>
<i>I. Pletikosic, T. Yilmaz, B. Sinkovic, A. P. Weber, G. D. Gu, T. Valla</i>
<p>Superconductivity in topological insulators is expected to show very
unconventional features such as $p+ip$ order parameter, Majorana fermions etc.
However, the intrinsic superconductivity has been observed in a very limited
number of materials in which the pairing symmetry is still a matter of debate.
Here, we study the topological crystalline insulator
(Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$)$_{1-y}$In$_y$Te, where a peculiar insulator to
superconductor transition was previously reported near the gap inversion
transition, when the system is nearly a 3-dimensional Dirac semimetal. Both the
existence of superconductivity near the 3-dimensional Dirac semimetal and the
occurrence of insulator to superconductor transition in an isotropic material
is highly unusual. We suggest that the observed phenomena are related to an
intrinsic instability of a 3-dimensional Dirac semimetal state in
(Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$)$_{1-y}$In$_y$Te and "flattening" of the bulk valence and
conduction bands as they acquire a Mexican hat-like dispersion on the inverted
side of the phase diagram. This favors the pairing instability if the chemical
potential is pinned to these flat regions.

<h3>SmoQyDQMC.jl: A flexible implementation of determinant quantum Monte  Carlo for Hubbard and electron-phonon interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395</a>

<i>Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Sohan Malkaruge Costa, James Neuhaus, Andy Tanjaroon Ly, Yutan Zhang, Richard Scalettar, Kipton Barros, Steven Johnston</i>
<p>We introduce the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the
determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized
tight-binding Hamiltonians with on-site Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon
interactions, including non-linear $e$-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice
potentials. Our implementations use hybrid Monte Carlo methods with exact
forces for sampling the phonon fields, enabling efficient simulation of
low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl
package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to
different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia
ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub
repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the
Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, can be

<h3>Strong coupling quantum impurity solver on the real and imaginary axis</h3>

<br>
<i>Kristjan Haule</i>
<p>The diagramatic Monte Carlo method has so far been primarily used in
connection with the weak coupling expansion. Here we show that the strong
coupling expansion offers a significant advantage: it can be efficiently
implemented on both the real and the imaginary axis at finite temperature.
Using the example of a quantum impurity solver for the Dynamical Mean Field
Theory (DMFT) problem, we illustrate rapid convergence with respect to the
expansion order. We derive a closed-form expression for the Feynman diagrams of
arbitrary order on the real axis. Employing these Feynman rules, we implement
the bold hybridization-expansion quantum Monte Carlo (BHQMC) impurity solver
and compare its performance to state-of-the-art results from Numerical
Renormalization Group calculations of the Mott transition within DMFT applied
to the Hubbard model. We demonstrate its power in providing a very precise
frequency dependent scattering rate at finite temperature, enabling accurate
spectroscopy calculations and delivering benchmark results for transport within
DMFT.

<h3>Unlearning regularization for Boltzmann Machines</h3>

<br>
<i>Enrico Ventura, Simona Cocco, Rémi Monasson, Francesco Zamponi</i>
<p>Boltzmann Machines (BMs) are graphical models with interconnected binary
units, employed for the unsupervised modeling of data distributions. As all
models, in absence of a proper regularization BMs may over-fit the training
data and thus provide a poor estimate of the distribution that generated them.
In this study, we introduce a regularization method for BMs to improve
generalization by reducing the susceptibility of the model under rescaling of
the parameters. The new technique shares formal similarities with the
unlearning algorithm, an iterative procedure used to improve memory
associativity in Hopfield-like neural networks. We test our unlearning
regularization on synthetic data generated by two simple models, the
Curie-Weiss ferromagnetic model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass
model, and we show that it outperforms $L_p$-norm schemes. Finally, we discuss
the role of parameter initialization.

<h3>A Unifying View of Fermionic Neural Network Quantum States: From Neural  Network Backflow to Hidden Fermion Determinant States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09450" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09450</a>
<br>
<i>Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark</i>
<p>Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural
network backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two
prominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here
we develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all
in the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent
single-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We
show that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r
\times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction
to the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant
Jastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the
additive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and
analytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two
matrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span
a larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the
SPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the
standard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we
uncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows
significant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is
partially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.

<h3>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an  advancing solidification front</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</a>
<br>
<i>Jochem G. Meijer, Vincent Bertin, Detlef Lohse</i>
<p>Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to long-range
capillary interactions. This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we
experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged
particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process.
Particles that are more thermally conductive than water are observed to attract
each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen
Cheerios effect. On the other hand, particles less conductive than water
separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing.
Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an
understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall
strength of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the
solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity
mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive
nature of the particle-particle interaction.

<p>We report heavy electron behavior in unconventional superconductor
YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ ($T_C \,{=}\, 1.2$ K). We directly observe very heavy bands
($m_\mathrm{eff}\sim 25 m_e$) within $\sim$10 meV of the Fermi level $E_{F}$
using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). The flat bands reside
at the X points of the Brillouin zone and are composed principally of $d_{xz}$
and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. We utilize many-body perturbative theory, GW, to
calculate the electronic structure of this material, obtaining excellent
agreement with the ARPES data with relatively minor band renormalizations and
band shifting required. We obtain further agreement at the Dynamical Mean Field
Theory (DMFT) level, highlighting the emergence of the many-body physics at low
energies (near $E_F$) and temperatures.

<p>Chirality, a fundamental concept from biological molecules to advanced
materials, is prevalent in nature. Yet, its intricate behavior in specific
topological systems remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the
emergence of hidden chiral domain wall states using a double-chain
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with interchain coupling specifically designed to
break chiral symmetry. Our phase diagram reveals single-gap and double-gap
phases based on electronic structure, where transitions occur without
topological phase changes. In the single-gap phase, we reproduce chiral domain
wall states, akin to chiral solitons in the double-chain model, where chirality
is encoded in the spectrum and topological charge pumping. In the double-gap
phase, we identify hidden chiral domain wall states exhibiting opposite
chirality to the domain wall states in the single-gap phase, where the opposite
chirality is confirmed through spectrum inversion and charge pumping as the
corresponding domain wall slowly moves. By engineering gap structures, we
demonstrate control over hidden chiral domain states. Our findings open avenues
to investigate novel topological systems with broken chiral symmetry and
potential applications in diverse systems.

<h3>Atoms as Words: A Novel Approach to Deciphering Material Properties  using NLP-inspired Machine Learning on Crystallographic Information Files  (CIFs)</h3>

<i>Lalit Yadav</i>
<p>In condensed matter physics and materials science, predicting material
properties necessitates understanding intricate many-body interactions.
Conventional methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular
dynamics (MD) often resort to simplifying approximations and are
computationally expensive. Meanwhile, recent machine learning methods use
handcrafted descriptors for material representation which sometimes neglect
vital crystallographic information and are often limited to single property
prediction or a sub-class of crystal structures. In this study, we pioneer an
unsupervised strategy, drawing inspiration from Natural Language Processing
(NLP), to harness the underutilized potential of Crystallographic Information
Files (CIFs). We conceptualize atoms and atomic positions within a CIF
similarly to words in textual content. Using a Word2Vec-inspired technique, we
produce atomic embeddings that capture intricate atomic relationships. Our
model, CIFSemantics, trained on the extensive Material Project dataset, adeptly
predicts 15 distinct material properties from the CIFs. Its performance rivals
specialized models, marking a significant step forward in material property
predictions.

<h3>Heterogeneity and Low-Frequency Vibrations in Bidisperse Sphere Packings</h3>

<br>
<i>Yusuke Hara, Hideyuki Mizuno, Atsushi Ikeda</i>
<p>In the jamming transition of monodisperse packings, spatial heterogeneity is
irrelevant as the transition is described by mean-field theories. Here, we show
that this situation drastically changes if the particle-size dispersity is
large enough. We use computer simulations to study the structural and
vibrational properties of bidisperse sphere packings with a large size ratio.
Near the critical point, the small particles tend to form clusters, leading to
the emergence of large-scale structural heterogeneity. Concomitantly, the
low-frequency vibrations are significantly enhanced compared to those in
monodisperse packings, and their density of states follows a linear law with
the frequency. We numerically and theoretically demonstrate that these
behaviors of the structural heterogeneity and the low-frequency vibrations are
intimately connected. The present work suggests that the nature of
heterogeneous packings is markedly different from that of homogeneous packings.

<h3>Dissipation Enhanced Unidirectional Transport in Topological Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09534</a>
<br>
<i>Ming Lu, Xue-Zhu Liu, Hailong Li, Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Jie Liu, X.C. Xie</i>
<p>Dissipation is a common occurrence in real-world systems and is generally
considered to be detrimental to transport. In this study, we examine the
transport properties of a narrow quantum anomalous Hall system with dissipation
applied on one edge. When the Fermi level resides within the hybridization gap,
we find that while transport is suppressed on one edge, it is significantly
enhanced on the other. We reveal that this enhancement arises from
dissipation-induced gap closure, which is deeply rooted in the point gap
topology of the system, resulting in a reduction of the decaying coefficient.
When the dissipation is very large, we find that the low-energy physics is
nearly indistinguishable from a narrower system, whose dissipation amplitude is
inversely proportional to that of the original one. To get more physical
intuition, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics can be well captured by a
pair of coupled counter-propagating chiral edge states, one of which has a
modified group velocity and an effective dissipation. We also briefly discuss
the possible experimental realizations of this enhanced unidirectional
transport.

<h3>Universal Hyperuniform Organization of Cellular Structures in Leaf Vein  Networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuan Liu, Duyu Chen, Yang Jiao, Jianxiang Tian</i>
<p>Leaf vein network is a hierarchical vascular system that transports water and
nutrients to the leaf cells. The thick primary veins form a branched network,
while the secondary veins develop closed circuits forming a well-defined
cellular structure. Through extensive analysis of a variety of distinct leaf
species, we discover that the apparently disordered cellular structures of the
secondary vein networks exhibit a universal hyperuniform organization and
possess a hidden order on large scales. Disorder hyperuniform (DHU) systems
lack conventional long-range order, yet they completely suppress normalized
large-scale density fluctuations like crystals. Specifically, we find that the
distributions of the geometric centers associated with the vein network loops
possess a vanishing static structure factor in the zero-wavenumber limit, i.e.,
$S(k) \sim k^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha \approx 0.64$, providing an example of
class III hyperuniformity in biology. This hyperuniform organization leads to
superior efficiency of diffusive transport, as evidenced by the much faster
convergence of the time-dependent spreadability $\mathcal{S}(t)$ to its
long-time asymptotic limit, compared to that of other uncorrelated or
correlated disordered but non-hyperuniform organizations. Our results also have
implications for the discovery and design of novel disordered network materials
with optimal transport properties.

<i>Niaz Ali Khan, Wen Chen, Munsif Jan, Gao Xianlong</i>
<p>The accurate description and robust computational modeling of the
nonequilibrium properties of quantum systems remain challenges in condensed
matter physics. In this work, we develop a linear-scale computational
simulation technique for the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum quench
systems. In particular, we report a polynomial expansion of the Loschmidt echo
to describe the dynamical quantum phase transitions of noninteracting quantum
quench systems. An expansion based method allows us to efficiently compute the
Loschmidt echo for infinitely large systems without diagonalizing the system
Hamiltonian. To demonstrate its utility, we highlight quantum quenching
dynamics under tight-binding quasicrystals and disordered lattices in one
spatial dimension. In addition, the role of the wave vector on the quench
dynamics under lattice models is addressed. We observe wave vector-independent
dynamical phase transitions in self-dual localization models.

<p>Coherently dressed spins have shown promising results as building blocks for
future quantum computers owing to their resilience to environmental noise and
their compatibility with global control fields. This mode of operation allows
for more amenable qubit architecture requirements and simplifies signal routing
on the chip. However, multi-qubit operations, such as qubit addressability and
two-qubit gates, are yet to be demonstrated to establish global control in
combination with dressed qubits as a viable path to universal quantum
computing. Here we demonstrate simultaneous on-resonance driving of degenerate
qubits using a global field while retaining addressability for qubits with
equal Larmor frequencies. Furthermore, we implement SWAP oscillations during
on-resonance driving, constituting the demonstration of driven two-qubit gates.
Significantly, our findings highlight the fragility of entangling gates between
superposition states and how dressing can increase the noise robustness. These
results represent a crucial milestone towards global control operation with
dressed qubits. It also opens a door to interesting spin physics on degenerate
spins.

<h3>Light-induced ideal Weyl semimetal in HgTe via nonlinear phononics</h3>

<br>
<i>Dongbin Shin, Angel Rubio, Peizhe Tang</i>
<p>Interactions between light and matter allow the realization of
out-of-equilibrium states in quantum solids. In particular, nonlinear phononics
is one of the efficient approaches to realizing the stationary electronic state
in non-equilibrium. Herein, by using extended $ab~initio$ molecular dynamics,
we identify that long-lived light-driven quasi-stationary geometry could
stabilize the topological nature in the material family of HgTe compounds. We
show that coherent excitation of the infrared-active phonon mode results in a
distortion of the atomic geometry with a lifetime of several picoseconds. We
show that four Weyl points are located exactly at the Fermi level in this
non-equilibrium geometry, making it an ideal long-lived metastable Weyl
semimetal. We propose that such a metastable topological phase can be
identified by photoelectron spectroscopy of the Fermi arc surface states or
ultrafast pump-probe transport measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect.

<p>The recent discovery of orientation-dependent superconductivity in
KTaO3-based interfaces has attracted considerable interest, while the
underlying origin remains an open question. Here we report a different approach
to tune the interfacial electron gas and superconductivity by forming
interfaces between rare-earth (RE) metals (RE being La, Ce, Eu) and KTaO3
substrates with different orientations. We found that the interfacial
superconductivity is strongest for the Eu/KTaO3 interfaces, becomes weaker in
La/KTaO3 and is absent in Ce/KTaO3. Using in-situ photoemission, we observed
distinct valence bands associated with RE metals, as well as a pronounced
orientation dependence in the interfacial electronic structure, which can be
linked to the orientation-dependent superconductivity. The photoemission
spectra show similar double-peak structures for the (111) and (110) oriented
interfaces, with an energy separation close to the LO4 phonon of KTaO3.
Detailed analyses suggest that this double-peak structure could be attributed
to electron-phonon coupling, which might be important for the interfacial
superconductivity.

<h3>Control of trigonal crystal field in honeycomb cobaltate antiferromagnet  towards Kitaev quantum spin liquid</h3>

<i>Gye-Hyeon Kim, Miju Park, Uksam Choi, Baekjune Kang, Uihyeon Seo, GwangCheol Ji, Seunghyeon Noh, Deok-Yong Cho, Jung-Woo Yoo, Jong Mok Ok, Changhee Sohn</i>
<p>Recently, layered honeycomb cobaltates have been predicted as a new promising
system for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid, a many-body quantum
entangled ground state characterized by fractional excitations. Yet, these
cobaltates exhibit classical antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures due
to their trigonal crystal field, which impedes the formation of the expected
quantum state, similar to other candidate materials. In this letter, we
demonstrate the control of the trigonal crystal field of Co ions is a key to
destabilizing classical antiferromagnetic ordering in layered honeycomb
cobaltates. By utilizing heterostructure engineering in Cu3Co2SbO6 thin films,
we adjust the trigonal distortion of CoO6 octahedra and the associated trigonal
crystal field. The original N\'eel temperature of 16 K in bulk Cu3Co2SbO6
decreases (increases) to 7.8 K (22.7 K) in strained Cu3Co2SbO6 films by
reducing (raising) the magnitude of the trigonal crystal fields. Our
experimental finding substantiates the potential of layered honeycomb cobaltate
heterostructures to accomplish the extremely elusive quantum phase of matter.

<h3>Weak breakdown of bulk-boundary correspondence in a symmetry-protected  topological phase out-of-equilibrium</h3>

<br>
<i>Thomas L. M. Lane, Miklós Horváth, Kristian Patrick</i>
<p>Time evolution of topological systems is an active area of interest due to
their expected uses in fault tolerant quantum computing. Here, we analyze the
dynamics of a non-interacting spinless fermion chain in its topological phase,
when the system is quenched out-of-equilibrium by a Hamiltonian belonging to
the same symmetry class. Due to the presence of particle-hole symmetry, we find
that the bulk properties of the system remain intact throughout the evolution.
However, the boundary properties may be drastically altered, where we see
delocalization of initially localized Majorana edge modes. The presence of
local static disorder can be utilized to preserve exponential localization, yet
we still identify non-trivial dynamics in the Majorana polarization and
Loschmidt echo. We find that, due to delocalization, the entanglement spectrum
is no longer a good indicator of the bulk topological phase, as the system
remains non-trivial while degeneracies in the many-body entanglement spectrum
are lost.

<h3>Converting Non-Equilibrium Charge Density into Spin Current</h3>

<br>
<i>Marc Vila, Joel E. Moore</i>
<p>The interconversion between charge and spin degrees of freedom is of both
fundamental and technological relevance in spintronics. While a non-equilibrium
spin density and a charge current are related by the well known
Rashba-Edelstein effect, here we theoretically model the generation of a
time-dependent spin current due to a periodic modulation of the charge density,
for example by a gate. By using the Boltzmann transport equation, we show that
when the chemical potential is varied, a spin current is generated in the time
scale it takes for the system to re-equilibrate in the new chemical potential.
The effect is ubiquitous in many systems with spin-momentum locking; we compute
the strength of the effect in four examples and propose a simple device scheme
to measure the spin accumulation resulting from such time-dependent spin
currents. Our findings test fundamental theoretical questions about
charge-to-spin conversion mechanisms and provide an all-electrical way to
generate spin currents without the need for charge currents, magnetic materials
or optical methods.

<i>Daniele Di Miceli, Llorenç Serra</i>
<p>The chiral topological superconductor, which supports propagating nontrivial
edge modes while maintaining a gapped bulk, can be realized hybridizing a
quantum-anomalous-Hall thin slab with an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. We
show that by sweeping the voltage bias in a normal-hybrid-normal double
junction, the pattern of electric currents in the normal leads spans three main
regimes. From single-mode edge-current quantization at low bias, to double-mode
edge-current oscillations at intermediate voltages and up to diffusive bulk
currents at larger voltages. Observing such patterns by resolving the spatial
distribution of the local current in the thin slab could provide additional
evidence, besides the global conductance, on the physics of chiral topological
superconductors.

MXenes-2D structured transition metal carbides and nitrides with various

work function in halide perovskite absorbers and significantly improved the
n-type charge collection in solar cells. This work demonstrates that MXenes
allow for efficient stabilization of perovskite solar cells besides improving
their performances. We introduce a new mixed composite bathocuproine:MXene,
i.e., (BCP:MXene) interlayer at the interface between an electron-transport
layer (ETL) and a metal cathode in the p-in device structure. Our investigation
demonstrates that the use of BCP:MXene interlayer slightly increases the power
conversation efficiency (PCE) for PSCs (from 16.5 for reference to 17.5%) but
dramatically improves the out of Glove-Box stability. Under ISOS-L-2 light

<p>In this experimental study, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy to investigate Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states induced by 4f-shell
rare-earth Gd adatoms on a superconducting Nb(110) surface. We engineer Gd atom
chains along the substrate's $[1\overline{1}0]$ and $[001]$ directions,
revealing distinct behaviors in differently oriented chains.
$[1\overline{1}0]$-oriented Gd chains exhibit spectroscopic features at their
ends, identifying them as trivial edge states, while $[001]$-oriented Gd chains
display zero-energy edge states, suggesting non-trivial nature. Notably, Gd
chains with four atoms--independent of their particular orientation--exhibit a
uniform zero-energy mode along the entire chain. These findings call for
further research and a theoretical framework to describe rare-earth-based

<p>Scaling superconducting digital circuits requires fundamental changes in the
current material set and fabrication process. The transition to 300 mm wafers
and the implementation of advanced lithography are instrumental in facilitating
mature CMOS processes, ensuring uniformity, and optimizing the yield. This
study explores the properties of NbxTi(1-x)N films fabricated by magnetron DC
sputtering on 300 mm Si wafers. As a promising alternative to traditional Nb in
device manufacturing, NbxTi(1-x)N offers numerous advantages, including
enhanced stability and scalability to smaller dimensions, in both processing
and design. As a ternary material, NbxTi(1-x)N allows engineering material
parameters by changing deposition conditions. The engineered properties can be
used to modulate device parameters through the stack and mitigate failure
modes. We report characterization of NbxTi(1-x)N films at less than 2%
thickness variability, 2.4% Tc variability and 3% composition variability. The
films material properties such as resistivity (140-375 {\Omega}cm) and critical
temperature Tc (4.6 K - 14.1 K) are correlated with stoichiometry and
morphology of the films. Our results highlight the significant influence of
deposition conditions on crystallographic texture along the films and its

<i>Manon L'Estimé, Michael Schindler, Noushine Shahidzadeh, Daniel Bonn</i>
<p>The droplet size in emulsions is known to affect the rheological properties
and plays a crucial role in the many applications of emulsions. Despite its
importance, the underlying mechanisms governing droplet size in emulsification
remain poorly understood. We investigate the average drop size and size
distribution upon emulsification with a high-shear mixer for model oil-in-water
emulsions stabilized by a surfactant. The size distribution is found to be a
log-normal distribution, resulting from the repetitive random breakup of drops.
High-shear emulsification, the usual way of making emulsions, is therefore
found to be very different from turbulent emulsification given by the
Kolmogorov-Hinze theory for which power-law distributions of the drop size are
expected. In agreement with this, the mean droplet size does not follow a
scaling with the Reynolds number of the emulsification flow, but rather a
capillary number scaling based on the viscosity of the continuous phase.

<h3>Spin-phonon interactions on the kagome lattice: Dirac spin liquid versus  valence-bond solids</h3>

<br>
<i>Francesco Ferrari, Federico Becca, Roser Valenti</i>
<p>We investigate the impact of the spin-phonon coupling on the S=1/2 Heisenberg
model on the kagome lattice. For the pure spin model, there is increasing
evidence that the low-energy properties can be correctly described by a Dirac
spin liquid, in which spinons with a conical dispersion are coupled to emergent
gauge fields. Within this scenario, the ground-state wave function is well
approximated by a Gutzwiller-projected fermionic state [Y. Ran, M. Hermele,
P.A. Lee, and X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 117205 (2007)]. However, the
existence of U(1) gauge fields may naturally lead to instabilities when small
perturbations are included. Since phonons are ubiquitous in real materials,
they may play a relevant role in the determination of the actual physical
properties of the kagome antiferromagnet. We perform a step forward in this
direction, including phonon degrees of freedom (at the quantum level) and
applying a variational approach based upon Gutzwiller-projected fermionic
Ans\"atze. Our results suggest that the Dirac spin liquid is stable for small
spin-phonon couplings, while valence-bond solids are obtained at large
couplings. Even though different distortions can be induced by the spin-phonon
interaction, the general aspect is that the energy is lowered by maximizing the
density of perfect hexagons in the dimerization pattern.

<p>We study a 2D mesoscopic ring with an anisotropic effective mass considering
surface quantum confinement effects. Consider that the ring is defined on the
surface of a cone, which can be controlled topologically and mapped to the 2D
ring in flat space. We demonstrate through numerical analysis that the
electronic properties, the magnetization, and the persistent current undergo
significant changes due to quantum confinement and non-isotropic mass. We
investigate these changes in the direct band gap semiconductors SiC, ZnO, GaN,
and AlN. There is a plus (or minus) shift in the energy sub-bands for different
values of curvature parameter and anisotropy. Manifestations of this nature are
also seen in the Fermi energy profile as a function of the magnetic field and
in the ring width as a function of the curvature parameter. Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
and de Haas van-Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are also studied, and we find that
they are sensitive to variations in curvature and anisotropy.

<p>It stands to reason that the amount and the quality of big data is of key
importance for setting up accurate AI-driven models. Nonetheless, we believe
there are still critical roadblocks in the inherent generation of databases,
that are often underestimated and poorly discussed in the literature. In our
view, such issues can seriously hinder the AI-based discovery process, even
when high quality, sufficiently large and highly reputable data sources are
available. Here, considering superconducting and thermoelectric materials as
two representative case studies, we specifically discuss three aspects, namely
intrinsically biased sample selection, possible hidden variables, disparate

<i>David Richard</i>
<p>We present a novel formalism to characterize elastic heterogeneities in
amorphous solids. In particular, we derive high-order strain-energy expansions
for pairwise energies under athermal quasistatic dynamics. We then use the
presented formalism to study the statistical properties of pairwise expansion
coefficients and their link with the statistics of soft, quasilocalized modes,
for a wide range of formation histories in both two- and three-dimensional
systems. We further exploit the presented framework to access local yield
stress maps by performing a non-linear stress-strain expansion within a cavity
embedded in a frozen matrix. We show that our "bond micromechanics" compare
well with the original "frozen matrix" method, with the caveat of
overestimating large stress activations. We additionally show how local yield
rules can be used as input for a scalar elasto-plastic model (EPM) to predict
the stress response of materials ranging from ductile to brittle. Finally, we
highlight some of the limits of simple mesoscale models in capturing the aging
dynamics of post-yielding systems. Intriguingly, we observe subdiffusive and
diffusive shearband growths for particle-based simulations and EPMs,
respectively.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides have
potential applications in various fields. Recently, it is shown experimentally
and theoretically that monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoflakes with neutral edges are
stable. Here, we study PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons with the stable zigzag edges
through first-principles investigation and find Rashba spin splitting and
gapped relativstic electron dispersion in their valence and conduction bands
near the Fermi level. Our analysis of atom-projected band structures and
densities of states indicates that the part of bands originates mainly from the
edges of the nanoribbons. It is also shown that there exists a SU(2) spin
symmetry in both valence and conduction band edges, which implies persistent
spin helix along the edges. Furthermore, we can achieve a Dirac electron model
for an edge by combining the valence and conduction bands when the inter-edge
interaction is week. These electronic systems could be useful for designing
high-performance spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

<p>A viscous, lubrication-like response can be triggered in a thin film of fluid
squeezed between a rigid and flat surface and the tip of an incoming
projectile. We develop a comprehensive theory for this viscous approach stage
of fluid-mediated normal impact, applicable to soft impactors. Under the
assumption of mediating fluid being incompressible, the impacting solid
displays two limit regimes: one dominated by elasticity and the other by
inertia. The transition between the two is predicted by a dimensionless
parameter, which can be interpreted as the ratio between two time scales that
are the time that it takes for the surface waves to warn the leading edge of
the impactor of the forthcoming impact, and the characteristic duration of the
final viscous phase of the approach. Additionally, we assess the role of solid
compressibility and elucidate why nearly-incompressible solids feature (a)
substancial "gliding" prior to contact at the transition between regimes, (b)
the largest size of entrapped bubble between the deformed tip of the impactor
and the flat surface, and (c) a sudden drop in entrapped bubble radius past the
transition between regimes. Finally, we argue that the above time scale ratio
(a dimensionless number) can govern the different dynamics reported
experimentally for a fluid droplet as a function of its viscosity and surface
tension.

<h3>Emerging Majorana zero modes as a manifestation of edge-bulk  incompatibility</h3>

<br>
<i>Jinhong Park, Yuval Gefen</i>
<p>Engineering experimentally accessible solid state platforms that facilitate
the realization of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) has been a challenging task over
recent years. Here we employ a complex edge consisting of both "downstream" and
"upstream" chiral modes to design a MZM-supporting platform, and show that the
latter does not necessitate the introduction of an external superconducting
contact. Specifically we consider the edge of a $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum
Hall phase, where the downstream (upstream) mode is charged (neutral). We show
that the boundary of an elongated quantum anti-dot ("quantum anti-wire")
embedded in the $\nu =2/3$ phase can host MZMs in the neutral sector. The
emergence of the MZMs is induced by gap-opening processes along the quantum
anti-wire, which are incompatible with gap-opening processes in the bulk of the
$\nu=2/3$ state. An experimental setup to identify neutral MZMs is proposed.

<h3>Fermi surface symmetric mass generation: a quantum Monte-Carlo study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09970</a>
<br>
<i>Wei-Xuan Chang, Sibo Guo, Yi-Zhuang You, Zi-Xiang Li</i>
<p>The symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase is an insulator in which a
single-particle gap is intrinsically opened by the interaction, without
involving symmetry spontaneously breaking or topological order. Here, we
perform unbiased quantum Monte-Carlo simulation and systematically investigate
a bilayer fermionic model hosting Fermi surface SMG in the strongly interacting
regime. With increasing interaction strength, the model undergoes a quantum
phase transition from an exciton insulator to an SMG phase, belonging to the
(2+1)-dimensional O(4) universality class. We access the spectral properties of
the SMG phase, resembling a Mott insulating phase with relatively flat
dispersion and pronounced spectral broadening. The dispersion of Green's
function zeros is extracted from spectral function, featuring a surface at zero
frequency precisely located at the original non-interacting Fermi surface,
which constitutes a hallmark of the Fermi surface SMG phase. The bilayer model
we study is potentially relevant to the newly discovered high-$T_c$
superconductor $\rm{La}_3 \rm{Ni}_2 \rm{O}_7$. Our results in SMG phase
qualitatively capture the salient features of spectral function unveiled in
recent ARPES experiments, shedding new insight on the underlying physics of
$\rm{La}_3 \rm{Ni}_2 \rm{O}_7$.

<h3>Charge Density Wave Ordering in NdNiO$_2$: Effects of Multiorbital  Nonlocal Correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09983" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09983</a>
<br>
<i>Evgeny A. Stepanov, Matteo Vandelli, Alexander I. Lichtenstein, Frank Lechermann</i>
<p>In this work, we investigate collective electronic fluctuations and, in
particular, the possibility of the charge density wave ordering in an
infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$. We perform advanced many-body calculations for the
ab-initio three-orbital model by taking into account local correlation effects,
non-local charge and magnetic fluctuations, and the electron-phonon coupling.
We find that in the considered material, electronic correlations are strongly
orbital- and momentum-dependent. Notably, the charge density wave and magnetic
instabilities originate from distinct orbitals. In particular, we show that the
correlation effects lead to the momentum-dependent hybridization between
different orbitals, resulting in the splitting and shifting of the flat part of
the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ band. This strong renormalization of the electronic spectral
function drives the charge density wave instability that is related to the
intraband Ni-$d_{z^2}$ correlations. Instead, the magnetic instability stems
from the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which remains half-filled through the
redistribution of the electronic density between different bands even upon hole
doping. Consequently, the strength of the magnetic fluctuations remains nearly
unchanged for the considered doping levels. We argue that this renormalization
is not inherent to the stoichiometric case but can be induced by hole doping.

<h3>Sol-gel transition by evaporation in porous media</h3>

<p>Historical monuments, outdoor stone sculptures and artworks made of porous
materials are exposed to chemical and physical degradation over time.
Presently, the most promising route for consolidation of weakened porous
materials is the injection of viscoelastic solutions of polymerizing compounds.
Those compounds, after injection, undergo a sol-gel transition inside the
porous media through evaporation of the solvent. Finding a suitable gelifying
solution as a consolidant calls for understanding the drying kinetics of
viscoelastic fluids in porous media. Here, we present a multiscale study of the
drying kinetics of solutions during the sol-gel transition. We investigate the
drying dynamics and subsequent water uptake of a gel using NMR and X-ray
microtomography techniques in porous materials. We find that during drying, a
distinct front develops which separates the liquid region from the gelled
region. This front advances from the free surface of evaporation towards the
inner parts of the stone. We identify different drying periods which appear to
be dependent on the intrinsic properties of the porous medium influencing
strongly the homogeneity of the final gel distribution within a treated stone.
Our findings not only are relevant for the consolidation of porous artworks but
also for civil and soil engineering processes where the fluids considered are
generally more complex than water.

<h3>Tailoring hot-carrier distributions of plasmonic nanostructures through  surface alloying</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09996</a>
<br>

<p>Alloyed metal nanoparticles are a promising platform for plasmonically
enabled hot-carrier generation, which can be used to drive photochemical
reactions. Although the non-plasmonic component in these systems has been
investigated for its potential to enhance catalytic activity, its capacity to
affect the photochemical process favorably has been underexplored by
comparison. Here, we study the impact of surface alloy species and
concentration on hot-carrier generation in Ag nanoparticles. By
first-principles simulations, we photoexcite the localized surface plasmon,
allow it to dephase, and calculate spatially and energetically resolved
hot-carrier distributions. We show that the presence of non-noble species in
the topmost surface layer drastically enhances hot-hole generation at the
surface at the expense of hot-hole generation in the bulk, due to the
additional d-type states that are introduced to the surface. The energy of the
generated holes can be tuned by choice of the alloyant, with systematic trends
across the d-band block. Already low surface alloy concentrations have a large
impact, with a saturation of the enhancement effect typically close to 75% of a
monolayer. Hot-electron generation at the surface is hindered slightly by
alloying but here an judicious choice of the alloy composition allows one to
strike a balance between hot electrons and holes. In this context, it is also
important to consider that increasing the alloy concentration broadens the
localized surface plasmon resonance, and thus decreases hot-carrier generation
overall. Our work underscores the promise of utilizing multicomponent
nanoparticles to achieve enhanced control over plasmonic catalysis, and
provides guidelines for how hot-carrier distributions can be tailored by
designing the electronic structure of the surface through alloying.

<h3>Dynamic Clustering of Active Rings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10007</a>
<br>
<i>Ligesh Theeyancheri, Subhasish Chaki, Tapomoy Bhattacharjee, Rajarshi Chakrabarti</i>
<p>A collection of rings made of active Brownian particles (ABPs) for different
packing fractions and activities is investigated using computer simulations. We
show that active rings display an emergent dynamic clustering instead of the
conventional motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) as in the case of
collection of ABPs. Surprisingly, increasing packing fraction of rings exhibits
a non-monotonicity in the dynamics due to the formation of a large number of
small clusters. The conformational fluctuations of the polymers suppress the
usual MIPS exhibited by ABPs. Our findings demonstrate how the motion of a
collection of rings is influenced by the interplay of activity, topology, and
connectivity.

<h3>Topological Gap Opening without Symmetry Breaking from Dynamical Quantum  Correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10024" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10024</a>
<br>
<i>Francesca Paoletti, Laura Fanfarillo, Massimo Capone, Adriano Amaricci</i>
<p>Topological phase transitions are typically associated with the formation of
gapless states. Spontaneous symmetry breaking can lead to a gap opening thereby
obliterating the topological nature of the system. Here we highlight a
completely different destiny for a topological transition in presence of
interaction. Solving a Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with local interaction, we
show that dynamical quantum fluctuations can lead to the opening of a gap
without any symmetry breaking. As we vary the interaction and the bare mass of
the model, the continuous gapless topological transition turns into a
first-order one, associated with the presence of massive Dirac fermion at the
transition point showing a Gross-Neveu critical behaviour near the quantum
critical endpoint. We identify the gap opening as a condensed matter analog of
the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism of mass generation.

<h3>Calculated Spin Fluctuational Pairing Interaction in HgBa2CuO4 using  LDA+FLEX Method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10030" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10030</a>
<br>
<i>Griffin Heier, Sergey Y. Savrasov</i>
<p>A combination of density functional theory in its local density approximation
(LDA) with k- and $\omega $ dependent self--energy found from
fluctuational--exchange--type random phase approximation (FLEX--RPA) is
utilized here to study superconducting pairing interaction in a prototype
cuprate superconductor HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$. Although, FLEX--RPA methodology
have been widely applied in the past to unconventional superconductors,
previous studies were mostly based on tight--binding derived minimal
Hamiltonians, while the approach presented here deals directly with the first
principle electronic structure calculation of the studied material where spin
and charge susceptibilities are evaluated for a correlated subset of the
electronic Hilbert space as it is done in popular LDA+U and LDA+DMFT methods.
Based on our numerically extracted pairing interaction among the Fermi surface
electrons we exactly diagonalize a linearized BCS gap equation, whose highest
eigenstate is expectantly found corresponding to $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ symmetry for
a wide range of on-site Coulomb repulsions U and dopings that we treat using
virtual crystal approximation. Calculated normal state self--energies show a
weak k- and strong frequency dependence with particularly large electronic mass
enhancement in the vicinity of spin density wave instability. Although the
results presented here do not bring any surprisingly new physics to this very
old problem, our approach is an attempt to establish the numerical procedure to
evaluate material specific coupling constant $\lambda $ for high T$_{c}$
superconductors without reliance on tight--binding approximations of their
electronic structures. This is central for understanding trends of their
critical temperatures, as it was previously the case for electron--phonon
superconductors.

<p>We report on experimental observation of unidirectional propagation of
zero-momentum magnons in synthetic antiferromagnet consisting of strained
CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB trilayer. Inherent non-reciprocity of spin waves in synthetic
antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy results in smooth and monotonous
dispersion relation around Gamma point, where the direction of the phase
velocity is reversed, while the group velocity direction is conserved. The
experimental observation of this phenomenon by intensity-, phase-, and
time-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy is corroborated by
analytical models and micromagnetic simulations.

<h3>Hund electronic correlation in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10066" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10066</a>
<br>
<i>Zhenfeng Ouyang, Jia-Ming Wang, Jing-Xuan Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Li Huang, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<p>By means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory
(DFT+DMFT), we investigate the correlated electronic structures of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. Our calculations show that
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a multi-orbital Hund metal. Both the 3$d_{z^2}$ and
3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ orbitals of Ni are close to be half filled and contribute the
bands across the Fermi level. Band renormalization and orbital selective
electronic correlation are observed. Through imaginary-time correlation
functions, the discovery of high-spin configuration, spin-frozen phase, and
spin-orbital separation shows that the system is in a frozen moment phase at
high temperatures above 290 K and is a Fermi liquid at low temperatures, which
is further comfirmed by the calculated spin, orbital, and charge
susceptibilities under high temperatures. Our study uncovers Hundness in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure.
