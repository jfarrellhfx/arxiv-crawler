<p>Light incident upon materials can induce changes in their electrical
conductivity, a phenomenon referred to as photoresistance. In semiconductors,
the photoresistance is negative, as light-induced promotion of electrons across
the band gap enhances the number of charge carriers participating in transport.
In superconductors, the photoresistance is positive because of the destruction
of the superconducting state, whereas in normal metals it is vanishing. Here we
report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in metallic graphene.
We show that Dirac electrons exposed to continuous wave (CW) terahertz (THz)
radiation can be thermally decoupled from the lattice by 50~K which activates
hydrodynamic electron transport. In this regime, the resistance of graphene
constrictions experiences a decrease caused by the THz-driven superballistic
flow of correlated electrons. We analyze the dependencies of the negative
photoresistance on the carrier density, and the radiation power and show that
our superballistic devices operate as sensitive phonon-cooled bolometers and
can thus offer a picosecond-scale response time. Beyond their fundamental
implications, our findings underscore the practicality of electron
hydrodynamics in designing ultra-fast THz sensors and electron thermometers.

<h3>Observation of vortices in a dipolar supersolid</h3>

<p>Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous
symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal
structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave
functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to
be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform
to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms.
Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements
of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a
hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here,
with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate
vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline
order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation
of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference
in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids.
This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum
systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains
such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.

<p>Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered

a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite
fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from
an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its
asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the
theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by
incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the
general linear growth law analytically. We find that it quantitatively

<h3>Anomalous friction of supercooled glycerol on mica</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mathieu Lizée, Baptiste Coquinot, Guilhem Mariette, Alessandro Siria, Lydéric Bocquet</i>
<p>The fundamental understanding of friction of liquids on solid surfaces
remains one of the key knowledge gaps in the transport of fluids. While the
standard perspective emphasizes the role of wettability and commensurability,
recent works have unveiled the crucial role of the solid's internal
excitations, whether electronic or phononic, on liquid-solid dissipation. In
this work, we take advantage of the considerable variation of the molecular
timescales of supercooled glycerol under mild change of temperature, in order
to explore how friction depends on the liquid's molecular dynamics. Using a
dedicated tuning-fork-based AFM to measure the hydrodynamic slippage of
glycerol on mica, we report a 2-order of magnitude increase of the slip length
with decreasing temperature by only 30{\deg}C. However the solid-liquid
friction coefficient is found to be a non monotonous function of the fluid
molecular relaxation rate, f{\alpha}, at odd with an expected Arrhenius
behavior. In particular, the linear increase of friction with the liquid
molecular rate measured at high temperature cannot be accounted for by existing
modelling. We show that this unconventional and non-arrhenian friction is
consistent with a contribution of the solid's phonons to the liquid-solid
friction. This dynamical friction opens new perspectives to control
hydrodynamic flows by properly engineering phononic and electronic excitation
spectra in channel walls.

<h3>Critical Slowing Down in a Real Physical System</h3>

<p>The behavior of a dynamical system can exhibit abrupt changes when it crosses
a tipping point. To prevent catastrophic events, it is useful to analyze
indicators of the incoming bifurcation, as the divergence of the relaxation
time of the system when approaching the critical point. However, this
phenomenon, called critical slowing down (CSD), is hardly measurable in real
physical systems. In this paper we provide experimental evidence of CSD in a
laser system crossing the emission threshold and we analyze how it is affected
by a time changing parameter and by noise.

<h3>Coherent Modulation of Two-Dimensional Moiré States with On-Chip THz  Waves</h3>

<p>Van der Waals (vdW) structures of two-dimensional materials host a broad
range of physical phenomena. New opportunities arise if different functional
layers may be remotely modulated or coupled in a device structure. Here we
demonstrate the in-situ coherent modulation of moir\'e excitons and correlated
Mott insulators in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homo- or
hetero-bilayers with on-chip terahertz (THz) waves. Using common dual-gated
device structures, each consisting of a TMD moir\'e bilayer sandwiched between
two few-layer graphene (fl-Gr) gates with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)
spacers, we launch coherent phonon wavepackets at ~0.4-1 THz from the fl-Gr
gates by femtosecond laser excitation. The waves travel through the h-BN
spacer, arrive at the TMD bilayer with precise timing, and coherently modulate
the moir\'e excitons or the Mott states. These results demonstrate that the
fl-Gr gates, often used for electrical control of the material properties, can
serve as effective on-chip opto-elastic transducers to generate THz waves for
the coherent control and vibrational entanglement of functional layers in
commonly used moir\'e devices.

<h3>Critical behavior of the stochastic SIR model on random bond-diluted  lattices</h3>

<p>In this paper, we investigate the impact of bond-dilution disorder on the
critical behavior of the stochastic SIR model. Monte Carlo simulations were
conducted using square lattices with first- and second-nearest neighbor
interactions. Quenched bond-diluted lattice disorder was introduced into the
systems, allowing them to evolve over time. By employing percolation theory and
finite-size scaling analysis, we estimate both the critical threshold and
leading critical exponent ratios of the model for different bond-dilution rates
($p$). An examination of the average size of the percolating cluster and the
size distribution of non-percolating clusters of recovered individuals was
performed to ascertain the universality class of the model. The simulation
results strongly indicate that the present model belongs to a new universality
class distinct from that of 2D dynamical percolation, depending on the specific
$p$ value under consideration.

the spin pumping effect with ferromagnetic resonance. The samples were
deposited by dc magnetron sputtering at room temperature on Si (001)
substrates. The three bilayers of Nb/Py, Mo/Py and Bi/Py had a spin-orbit

<h3>Electro-optic properties from ab initio calculations in two-dimensional  materials</h3>

<p>Electro-optic (EO) effects relate the change of optical constants by
low-frequency electric fields. Thanks to the advent of Density Functional
Perturbation Theory (DFPT), the EO properties of bulk three-dimensional (3D)
materials can now be calculated in an ab initio way. However, the use of
periodic boundary conditions in most Density Functional Theory codes imposes to
simulate two-dimensional (2D) materials using slabs surrounded by a large layer
of vacuum. The EO coefficients predicted from such calculations, if not
rescaled properly, can severely deviate from the real EO properties of 2D
materials. The present work discusses the issue and introduces the rescaling
relationships allowing to recover the true EO properties.

<h3>Random interfaces generated by the addition of structures of variable  size</h3>

<br>
</p><i>N. Pétrélis, F. Pétrélis</i>
<p>We consider the random deposition of objects of variable width and height
over a line. The successive additions of these structures create a random
interface. We focus on the regime of heavy tailed distributions of the
structure width. When the structure center is chosen at random, the problem is
exactly solvable and we prove that the interfaces generically tend towards
self-affine random curves. The asymptotic behavior reached after a large number
of iterations is universal in the sense that it depends on only three
parameters: the shape of the added structure at its maximum, the power-law
exponent of the width distribution and the exponent that relates height and
width. The parameter space displays several transitions that separate different
asymptotic behaviors. In particular for a set of parameters, the interface
tends towards a fractional Brownian motion. Our results reveal the existence of
a new class of random interfaces which properties appear to be robust. The
mechanism that generates correlations at large distance is identified and it
explains the appearance of such correlations in several situations of interest
such as the physics of earthquakes or the propagation of energy through a
diffusive medium.

<p>Including the effect of lattice anharmonicity on electron-phonon interactions
has recently garnered attention due to its role as a necessary and significant
component in explaining various phenomena, including superconductivity, optical
response, and the temperature dependence of mobility. This study focuses on
analytically treating the effects of anharmonic electron-phonon coupling on the
polaron self-energy, combined with numerical Diagrammatic Monte Carlo data.
Specifically, we incorporate a quadratic interaction into the method of
squeezed phonon states, which has proven effective for analytically calculating
the polaron parameters. Additionally, we extend this method to non-parabolic
finite-width conduction bands while maintaining the periodic translation
symmetry of the system. Our results are compared with those obtained from
Diagrammatic Monte Carlo, partially reported in a recent study [Phys. Rev. B
107, L121109(2023)], covering a wide range of coupling strengths for the
nonlinear interaction. Remarkably, our analytic method predicts the same
features as the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulation.

<p>Niobium carbide (NbC) is a high-field Type II superconductor with a critical
temperature ($T_C$) of 11.1 K, just above that of pure Nb ($T_C = 9$ K).
Downsizing NbC to the nanoparticle scale introduces significant alterations in
its critical field and/or the superconducting temperature. Here we report on
superconducting NbC nanoparticles with $T_C \approx$ 10 K synthesized by laser
ablation in acetone, using the lens-target distance (laser fluence) and
centrifugation as control parameters of the particle size. X-ray diffraction
analyses certified the cubic NbC phase and electron microscopy images revealed
spherical particles with average size near 8 nm, with no apparent size
dependence on fluence. Besides, magnetization curves exhibited magnetic loops
featuring a saturation magnetization around $10^{-3} \mu_B$/molecule along with
a small and typical superconducting loop for all investigated samples. We also
observed a suppression of the diamagnetic behavior below $T_C$ upon decreasing
laser fluence. Moreover, all samples exhibited a weak electron spin resonance
(ESR) Curie-like signal at $g\approx2.0$ probably associated with localized
defects in the particle's surface. The intriguing coexistence of
superconductivity and magnetism in nanoparticles has recently garnered
significant research attention. This complex scenario and unique properties are
due to the substantial increase of surface-to-volume ratio in these
superconducting NbC nanoparticles and further investigation would be crucial to
unveil novel material properties and shed new light on our understanding of the
superconducting phenomenon in this new morphology.

<p>The kagome geometry is an example of frustrated configuration in which rich
physics takes place, including the emergence of superconductivity and charge
density wave (CDW). Among the kagome metals, ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ hosts an
unconventional CDW, with its electronic order showing a different periodicity
than that of the phonon which generates it. In this material, a CDW-softened
flat phonon band has a second-order collapse at the same time that the first
order transition occurs. This phonon band originates from the out-of-plane
vibrations of the Sc and Sn atoms, and it is at the base of the
electron-phonon-coupling driven CDW phase of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Here, we use
uniaxial strain to tune the frequency of the flat phonon band, tracking the
strain evolution via time-resolved optical spectroscopy and first-principles
calculations. Our findings emphasize the capability to induce an enhancement of
the unconventional CDW properties in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metal through control
of strain.

<p>We explore the collective response in an excitonic insulator phase in
Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ using a semirealistic model including relevant lattice and
electronic instabilities. We calculate order-parameter susceptibility and Raman
response within a time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach. Contrary to the
standard expectations, the amplitude mode frequency does not coincide with the
single-particle gap but has a higher frequency. We find a phase mode that is
massive because the excitonic condensation breaks a discrete symmetry only and
that becomes heavier as the electron-lattice coupling is increased. These
features are expected to apply to generic realistic excitonic insulators. We
discuss scenarios under which the phase mode does not appear as a sharp in-gap
resonance.

<p>We investigate the sedimentation of chiral particles in viscous fluid flow.
We identify helical ribbons as simple particles with strong
translation-rotation coupling whose symmetry ensures that the centers of mass,
buoyancy, resistance, and mobility coincide. Experimental measurements of both
relevant mobility tensors show excellent agreement with simulations of ribbons
made of interacting spheres. We observe quasi-periodic angular dynamics causing
complex spatial trajectories. In tilt-spin phase space, orbits are closed due
to time-reversal and reflection symmetry. Changing the helical ribbon length
reveals a bifurcation at which the stable sedimentation orientations switch.

<p>Nonlinear interactions of spin-waves and their quanta, magnons, have emerged
as prominent candidates for interference-based technology, ranging from quantum
transduction to antiferromagnetic spintronics. Yet magnon multiplication in the
terahertz (THz) spectral region represents a major challenge. Intense, resonant
magnetic fields from THz pulse-pairs with controllable phases and amplitudes
enable high order THz magnon multiplication, distinct from non-resonant
nonlinearities such as the high harmonic generation by below-band gap electric
fields. Here, we demonstrate exceptionally high-order THz nonlinear magnonics.
It manifests as 7$^\text{th}$-order spin-wave-mixing and 6$^\text{th}$ harmonic
magnon generation in an antiferromagnetic orthoferrite. We use THz
multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy to achieve high-sensitivity detection
of nonlinear magnon interactions up to six-magnon quanta in strongly-driven
many-magnon correlated states. The high-order magnon multiplication, supported
by classical and quantum spin simulations, elucidates the significance of
four-fold magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya symmetry breaking.
Moreover, our results shed light on the potential quantum fluctuation
properties inherent in nonlinear magnons.

<h3>Observation of nodal-arcs, effect of axial strain on the nodal-lines &  Weyl nodes and low-temperature finite value of Seebeck coefficient in TaAs  class of Weyl semimetals</h3>

</p><i>Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</i>
<p>This work verifies the SOC-induced evolution of \textit{nodal-arcs} into Weyl
nodes under the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in NbAs \& NbP. The
obtained features mimics the observations as reported for TaAs \& TaP in our
previous work\cite{pandey2023existence}. In addition, this work reports that
the number of nodes in TaAs class of Weyl semimetals (WSMs) can be altered via
creating strain along $a$ or $c$ direction of the crystal. For instance, the
number of nodes in NbAs under SOC-effect along with 2\% (3\%)
compressive-strain in $a$ direction is found to be 20 (28). Besides the nodes,
such strain are found to have considerable impact on the nodal-rings of these
WSMs when effect of SOC is ignored. Apart from this, the work discusses the
role of Weyl physics in affecting the Seebeck coefficient of any WSM. In this
direction, it is discussed that how a symmetric Weyl cone, even if tilted, have
no contribution to the Seebeck of WSMs. Furthermore, the work highlights the
conditions under which a Weyl cone can contribute to the Seebeck coefficient of
a given WSM. Lastly, the discussion of Weyl contribution to Seebeck is
validated over TaAs class of WSMs via investigating the features of its Weyl
cones and calculating the contributions of these cones to the Seebeck
coefficient of these semimetals. The value of $S$ contributed from Weyl cone is
found to be as large as $\sim$65 $\mu$\textit{V}/\textit{K} below 25 K in case
of TaAs. The findings of this work present a possibility of engineering the
topological properties of TaAs class of WSMs via creating strain in their
crystal. It also makes the picture of Weyl physics\textquoteright\hspace{0.1cm}
impact on the Seebeck coefficient of WSMs a more clear.

<p>The spin Hall effect (SHE) allows efficient generation of spin polarization
or spin current through charge current and plays a crucial role in the
development of spintronics. While SHE typically occurs in non-magnetic
materials and is time-reversal even, exploring time-reversal-odd (T-odd) SHE,
which couples SHE to magnetization in ferromagnetic materials, offers a new
charge-spin conversion mechanism with new functionalities. Here, we report the
observation of giant T-odd SHE in Fe3GeTe2/MoTe2 van der Waals heterostructure,
representing a previously unidentified interfacial magnetic spin Hall effect
(interfacial-MSHE). Through rigorous symmetry analysis and theoretical
calculations, we attribute the interfacial-MSHE to a symmetry-breaking induced
spin current dipole at the vdW interface. Furthermore, we show that this linear
effect can be used for implementing multiply-accumulate operations and binary
convolutional neural networks with cascaded multi-terminal devices. Our
findings uncover an interfacial T-odd charge-spin conversion mechanism with

<p>Results are presented for the dynamics of edge modes in interacting Floquet
Ising chains. It is shown that in addition to the quasi-stable $0$ and $\pi$
edge modes, a third long lived edge mode arising from the operator product of
the $0$ and $\pi$ edge modes exists. Depending on the microscopic parameters,
this Floquet product mode is shown to have a substantially longer lifetime than
the individual $0$ and $\pi$ modes. This is triggered by a scattering process
which converts a $0$ mode into a $\pi$ mode while scattering two bulk
excitations. This process can lead to a rapid decay of both $0$ and $\pi$ mode
without affecting the product mode.

<p>Understanding the nanoscale carrier dynamics induced by light excitation is
the key to unlocking futuristic devices and innovative functionalities in
advanced materials. Optical pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (OPP-STM)
has opened a window to these phenomena. However, mastering the combination of
ultrafast pulsed lasers with STM requires high expertise and effort. We have
shattered this barrier and developed a compact OPP-STM system accessible to
all. This system precisely controls laser pulse timing electrically and enables
stable laser irradiation on sample surfaces. Furthermore, by applying this
technique to atomic force microscopy (AFM), we have captured time-resolved
force signals with an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio. Originating
from the dipole-dipole interactions, these signals provide insights into the
carrier dynamics on sample surfaces, which are activated by photo-illumination.
These technologies are promising as powerful tools for exploring a wide range
of photoinduced phenomena in conductive and insulating materials.

<h3>Phonons in stringlet-land and the boson peak</h3>

</p><i>Cunyuan Jiang, Matteo Baggioli</i>
<p>Solid materials that deviate from the harmonic crystal paradigm exhibit
characteristic anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states
(VDOS) with respect to Debye's theory predictions. The boson peak (BP), a
low-frequency excess in the VDOS over Debye law $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$,
is certainly the most famous among them; nevertheless, its origin is still
subject of fierce debate. Recent simulation works provided strong evidence that
localized one-dimensional string-like excitations (stringlets) might be the
microscopic origin of the BP. In this work, we study the dynamics of acoustic
phonons interacting with a bath of vibrating 1D stringlets with exponentially
distributed size, as observed in simulations. We show that stringlets strongly
renormalize the phonon propagator and naturally induce a BP anomaly in the
vibrational density of states, corresponding to the emergence of a
dispersionless BP flat mode. Additionally, phonon-stringlet interactions
produce a strong enhancement of sound attenuation and a dip in the speed of
sound near the BP frequency, consistent with experimental and simulation data.
The qualitative trends of the BP frequency and intensity are predicted within
the model and shown to be in good agreement with previous observations. In
summary, our results substantiate with a simple theoretical model the recent
simulation results by Hu and Tanaka claiming the origin of the BP from
stringlet dynamics.

<p>We present comprehensive investigations into the structural, superconducting,
and topological properties of Bi$_2$PdPt. Magnetization and heat capacity
measurements performed on polycrystalline Bi$_2$PdPt demonstrate a
superconducting transition at $\approx$ 0.8 K. Moreover, muon spin
relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements present evidence for a time reversal
symmetry preserving, isotropically gapped superconducting state in Bi$_2$PdPt.
We have also performed density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on
Bi$_2$PdPt alongside the more general isostructural systems,
BiPd$_{x}$Pt$_{1-x}$, of which Bi$_2$PdPt and $\gamma$-BiPd are special cases
for $x=0.5$ and $x=1$ respectively. We have calculated the $Z_2$ topological
index from our DFT calculations for a range of substitution fractions, $x$,
between $x=0$ and $x=1$ characterizing the topology of the band structure. We
find a non-trivial topological state when $x>0.75$ and a trivial topological
state when $x<0.75$. Therefore our results indicate that BiPd$_{x}$Pt$_{1-x}$
could be a topological superconductor for $x>0.75$.

</p><i>Shuhan Ding, Shaozhi Li, Yao Wang</i>
<p>Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has
catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems.
These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states,
which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we
modify the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update
mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling
of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme
further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional
computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general
systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of
the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement
with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the
Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and
advantage of this method.

<p>We study a generalization of chiral symmetry applicable to non-Hermitian
systems and its topological consequences on one-dimensional chains. We uncover
a rich family of topological phases hosting several chiral flavors
characterized not by a single winding number, but a vector of of them. This, in
turn, leads to a novel type of bulk-boundary correspondence, where -- in
contrast with conventional chiral chains -- some flavors can have topologically
stable non-zero charges on both ends. Moreover, we find that the total charge
of each flavor can in some cases exceed the magnitude of the highest winding
number in the vector invariant. Our work extends the topological classification
of the non-Hermitian AIII class along a new axis.

<p>The Cluster Expansion (CE) Method encounters significant computational
challenges in multicomponent systems due to the computational expense of
generating training data through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
This work aims to refine the cluster and structure selection processes to
mitigate these challenges. We introduce a novel method that significantly
reduces the computational load associated with the calculation of fitting
parameters. This method employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, leveraging
the M3GNet network, which is trained using a select subset of DFT calculations
at each ionic step. The trained surrogate model excels in predicting the volume
and energy of the final structure for a relaxation run. By employing this
model, we sample thousands of structures and fit a CE model to the energies of
these GNN-relaxed structures. This approach, utilizing a large training
dataset, effectively reduces the risk of overfitting, yielding a CE model with
a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 10 meV/atom. We validate our method's
effectiveness in two test cases: the (Cr,Hf,Mo,Ta,Ti,Zr)B$_2$ diboride system
and the Refractory High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) AlHfNbTaTiZr system. Our findings
demonstrate the significant advantages of integrating a GNN model, specifically
the M3GNet network, with CE methods for the efficient predictive analysis of
chemical ordering in High Entropy Materials. The accelerating capabilities of
the hybrid ML-CE approach to investigate the evolution of Short Range Ordering
(SRO) in a large number of stoichiometric systems. Finally, we show how it is
possible to correlate the strength of chemical ordering to easily accessible

<h3>Classical dynamics and semiclassical analysis of excitons in cuprous  oxide</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18303" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18303</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jan Ertl, Michael Marquardt, Moritz Schumacher, Patric Rommel, Jörg Main, Manfred Bayer</i>
<p>Excitons, as bound states of electrons and holes, embody the solid state
analogue of the hydrogen atom, whose quantum spectrum is explained within a
classical framework by the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model. In a first
hydrogenlike approximation the spectra of excitons are also well described by a
Rydberg series, however, due to the surrounding crystal environment deviations
from this series can be observed. A theoretical treatment of excitons in
cuprous oxide needs to include the band structure of the crystal, leading to a
prominent fine-structure splitting in the quantum spectra. This is achieved by
introducing additional spin degrees of freedom into the system, making the
existence and meaningfulness of classical exciton orbits in the physical system
a non-trivial question. Recently, we have uncovered the contributions of
periodic exciton orbits directly in the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra
of cuprous oxide [J. Ertl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067401 (2022)] by
application of a scaling technique and fixing the energy of the classical
dynamics to a value corresponding to a principle quantum number $n=5$ in the
hydrogenlike case. Here, we present a comprehensive derivation of the classical
and semiclassical theory of excitons in cuprous oxide. In particular, we
investigate the energy dependence of the exciton dynamics. Both the
semiclassical and quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit stronger
deviations from the hydrogenlike behavior with decreasing energy, which is
related to a growing influence of the spin-orbit coupling and thus a higher
velocity of the secular motion of the exciton orbits. The excellent agreement
between semiclassical and quantum mechanical exciton recurrence spectra
demonstrates the validity of the classical and semiclassical approach to
excitons in cuprous oxide.

<h3>Bulk-entanglement-spectrum correspondence in $PT$- and $PC$-symmetric  topological insulators</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ryo Takahashi, Tomoki Ozawa</i>
<p>In this study, we discuss a new type of bulk-boundary correspondence which
holds for topological insulators when the parity-time ($PT$) and/or
parity-particle-hole ($PC$) symmetry are present. In these systems, even when
the bulk topology is nontrivial, the edge spectrum is generally gapped, and
thus the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold. We find that,
instead of the edge spectrum, the single-particle entanglement spectrum becomes
gapless when the bulk topology is nontrivial: i.e., the {\it
bulk-entanglement-spectrum correspondence} holds in $PT$- and/or $PC$-symmetric
topological insulators. After showing the correspondence using $K$-theoretic
approach, we provide concrete models for each symmetry class up to three
dimensions where nontrivial topology due to $PT$ and/or $PC$ is expected. An
implication of our results is that, when the bulk topology under $PT$ and/or
$PC$ symmetry is nontrivial, the many-body entanglement spectrum is multiply
degenerate in one dimension and is gapless in two or higher dimensions.

<h3>Unraveling the collinearity in short-range order parameters for lattice  configurations arising from topological constraints</h3>

</p><i>Abhijit Chatterjee</i>
<p>In multicomponent lattice problems, e.g., in alloys, and at crystalline
surfaces and interfaces, atomic arrangements exhibit spatial correlations that
dictate the kinetic and thermodynamic phase behavior. These correlations emerge
from interparticle interactions and are frequently reported in terms of the
short-range order (SRO) parameter. Expressed usually in terms of pair
distributions and other cluster probabilities, the SRO parameter gives the
likelihood of finding atoms/molecules of a particular type in the vicinity of
others atoms. This study focuses on fundamental constraints involving the SRO
parameters that are imposed by the underlying lattice topology. Using a
data-driven approach, we uncover the interrelationships between different SRO
parameters (e.g., pairs, triplets, quadruplets, etc.) on a lattice. The main
finding is that while some SRO parameters are independent, the remaining are
collinear, i.e., the latter are dictated by the independent ones through linear
relationships. A kinetic and thermodynamic modeling framework based on these
constraints is introduced.

</p><i>Laurent Bugnon, Christian Bernhard, Premysl Marsik</i>
<p>We present a broad band (THz to UV) ellipsometry study of the anisotropic
dielectric response of the orthorhombic perovskite YAlO3. The ellipsometric
measurements have been performed on YAlO3 crystals with three different surface
cuts and for six high symmetry configurations of the crystal axes with respect
to the plane of incidence of the photons. The obtained data are presented in
terms of the Mueller Matrix elements N, C, and S and their features are
analyzed and discussed with respect to the anisotropy of the dielectric
response tensor. In particular, in the infrared range we have identified all 25
infrared active phonon modes that have been predicted from theoretical studies.
We also discuss a negative refraction effect that naturally occurs in the
vicinity of an anisotropic longitudinal-optical phonon. Moreover, we have
determined the temperature dependence of the phonon parameters between 10 and
330 K. The dielectric response above the phonon range, from about 0.1 to 6.5
eV, is shown to be featureless and characteristic of an insulator with a large
band gap above 6.5 eV and is well described by anisotropic Cauchy model.

<br>
</p><i>Veljko Janković, Petar Mitrić, Darko Tanasković, Nenad Vukmirović</i>
<p>The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics
in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task
that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble)
approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections. Their importance remains
elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical
arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate
calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to
thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional
Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing
vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero
electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite
temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to
the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these
limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce
important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison
to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately
local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully
capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales
between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections
are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and
may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the
values of model parameters.

<h3>$J_{eff}$ states in a quasi one dimensional antiferromagnetic spin chain  hexagonal Iridates Sr$_3$MIrO$_6$ (M=Mg, Zn, Cd): an $ab-initio$ comparative  perspective</h3>

</p><i>Roumita Roy, Sudipta Kanungo</i>
<p>We employ first-principles density-functional theory, to perform a
comparative investigation of the effect of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the
electronic and magnetic properties of three experimentally synthesized and
characterized hexagonal perovskites Sr$_3$MIrO$_6$(M=Mg, Zn, Cd). The
electronic structure calculations show that in all the compounds, Ir is the
only magnetically active site in +4[5$d^5$] configuration, whereas M$^{+2}$
(M=Cd, Zn, Mg), remains in nonmagnetic states with Cd/Zn and Mg featuring
$d^{10}$ and $d^{0}$ electronic configurations, respectively. The insulating
gap could be opened by switching on the correlation parameter $U$ for
Sr$_3$CdrO$_6$ and Sr$_3$ZnIrO$_6$ which qualifies it to be a correlated Mott
insulator. However, in the case of Sr$_3$MgIrO$_6$ both $U$ and
antiferromagnetic ordering is not enough and the gap could only be opened by
including the SOC which classifies it to fall under the category of a typical
SOC Mott insulator. The $j_{eff}$ states are visualized from the orbital
projected band structure. The magnetism is studied from the point of view of
exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the presence of the
SOC. We also present the comparative analysis of the renormalized impact of SOC
on the three compounds, which shows that all the three compounds fall under the
$intermediate$ coupling regime, where Sr$_3$MgIrO$_6$ is comparatively closer
to the atomic $j_{eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ picture from the others.

<h3>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mangesh Bhendale, Jayant K. Singh, Alessio Zaccone</i>
<p>The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective
diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term
quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the
observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental
observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or
fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective
molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the
underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection
equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The
obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction
term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical
simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results
on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by
comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled
Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of
diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional
to the zero shear viscosity.

</p><i>Lucas Foppa, Matthias Scheffler</i>
<p>Using a modest amount of data from a large population, subgroup discovery
(SGD) identifies outstanding subsets of data with respect to a certain property
of interest of that population. The SGs are described by "rules". These are
constraints on key descriptive parameters that characterize the material or the
environment. These parameters and constraints are obtained by maximizing a
quality function that establishes a tradeoff between SG size and utility, i.e.,
between generality and exceptionality. The utility function measures how
outstanding a SG is. However, this approach does not give a unique solution,
but typically many SGs have similar quality-function values. Here, we identify
coherent collections of SGs of a "Pareto region" presenting various
size-utility tradeoffs and define a SG similarity measure based on the Jaccard
index, which allows us to hierarchically cluster these optimal SGs. These
concepts are demonstrated by learning rules that describe perovskites with high
bulk modulus. We show that SGs focusing on exceptional materials exhibit a high
quality-function value but do not necessarily maximize it. We compare the mean
shift with the cumulative Jensen-Shannon divergence ($D_{sJS}$) as utility
functions and show that the SG rules obtained with $D_{cJS}$ are more focused
than those obtained with the mean shift.

<h3>Physics and data driven model for prediction of residual stresses in  machining</h3>

</p><i>Rachit Dhar, Ankur Krishna, Bilal Muhammed</i>
<p>Predicting residual stresses has always been a topic of significance due to
its implications in the development of enhanced materials and better processing
conditions. In this work, an analytical model for prediction of residual
stresses is developed for orthogonal machining. It consists of three component
models for force, temperature and stress computation. The Oxley force model and
Waldorf's slip-line model are employed for obtaining cutting force, thrust
force, and temperatures at the shear zone and tool-chip interface for the given
parameters. The Komanduri-Hou two heat source model is used for obtaining the
temperature distribution in the workpiece. The effect of coolant with differing
mass flow rates has also been incorporated. The residual stresses are obtained
by combining the mechanical and thermal components, followed by the loading and
relaxation of the stresses. Optimal values for unknown parameters are predicted
by leveraging a cost function. The residual stress distributions obtained give
a tensile region near the surface for Inconel 718, and a compressive region for
Ti6Al4V, which are in line with experimental results found in literature.

This behavior is due to the scattering of electrons at singular points of the

<p>We present a pedagogical review of the periodically driven non-Hermitian
systems, particularly on the rich interplay between the non-Hermitian skin
effect and the topology. We start by reviewing the non-Bloch band theory of the
static non-Hermitian systems and discuss the establishment of its generalized
bulk-boundary correspondence. Ultimately, we focus on the non-Bloch band theory
of two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems: harmonically driven
non-Hermitian system and periodically quenched non-Hermitian system. The
non-Bloch topological invariants were defined on the generalized Brillouin zone
and the real space wave functions to characterize the Floquet non-Hermtian
topological phases. Then, the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence was
established for the two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems.
Additionally, we review novel phenomena in the higher-dimensional periodically
driven non-Hermitian systems, including Floquet non-Hermitian higher-order
topological phases and Floquet hybrid skin-topological modes. The experimental
realizations and recent advances have also been surveyed. Finally, we end with
a summarization and hope this pedagogical review can motivate further research
on Floquet non-Hermtian topological physics.

<p>On-chip refrigeration at cryogenic temperatures is becoming an important
requirement in the context of quantum technologies and nanoelectronics. Ferroic
materials with enhanced electrocaloric effects at phase transitions are good
material candidates for the same. By exploiting the Mott metal-insulator
transition (MIT) of TiOx(Ny), the bottom electrode, we engineer a
depolarization field controlled reversible polar to non-polar phase transition
in thick La-doped hafnia (40 nm). This transition occurs between ~125 and 140 K
and produces giant negative pyroelectric and electrocaloric effects.
Refrigeration metrics were estimated between 120 to 200 K, with a peak
refrigerant capacity of 25 kJ Kg-1 (2 kJ Kg-1), peak isothermal entropy
{\Delta}S~ 8 kJ Kg-1 K-1 (0.5 kJ Kg-1 K-1) and adiabatic {\Delta}Tcooling ~ 106
K (11 K) at ~140 K and 5 MV cm-1 (0.5 MV cm-1, and these are the largest
reported in any electrocaloric system. Our work fundamentally proposes design
guidelines to induce significant solid-state refrigeration through proximity

<p>We use a concerted theory-experiment effort to investigate the formation of
chiral real space spin texture when the archetypal Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$
is interfaced with In$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As, a ferromagnetic semiconductor with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our calculations reveal a nonzero
off-diagonal spin susceptibility in the Cd$_3$As$_2$ layer due to the Rashba
spin-orbit coupling from broken inversion symmetry. This implies the presence
of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between local moments in the
In$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As layer, mediated by Dirac electrons in the vicinal
Cd$_3$As$_2$ layer, potentially creating the conditions for a real space chiral
spin texture. Using electrical magnetoresistance measurements at low
temperature, we observe an emergent excess contribution to the transverse
magneto-resistance whose behavior is consistent with a topological Hall effect
arising from the formation of an interfacial chiral spin texture. This excess
Hall voltage varies with gate voltage, indicating a promising
electrostatically-tunable platform for understanding the interplay between the
helical momentum space states of a Dirac semimetal and chiral real space spin
textures in a ferromagnet.

</p><i>Benjamin Sorkin, David S. Dean</i>
<p>Single-file diffusion is a paradigmatic model for the transport of Brownian
colloidal particles in narrow one-dimensional channels, such as those found in
certain porous media, where the particles cannot cross each other. We consider
a system where a different external uniform potential is present to the right
and left of an origin. For example, this is the case when two channels meeting
at the origin have different radii. In equilibrium, the chemical potential of
the particles are equal, the density is thus lower in the region with the
higher potential, and by definition there is no net current in the system.
Remarkably, a single-file tracer particle initially located at the origin, with
position denoted by $Y(t)$, exhibits an average {\em up-hill} drift toward the
region of {\em highest} potential. This drift has the late time behavior
$\langle Y(t)\rangle= C t^{1/4}$, where the prefactor $C$ depends on the
initial particle arrangement. This surprising result is shown analytically by
computing the first two moments of $Y(t)$ through a simple and
physically-illuminating method, and also via extensive numerical simulations.

<h3>Octahedral and polar phase transitions in freestanding films of SrTiO3</h3>

<p>From extreme strain to bending, the possibilities in the manipulation of
freestanding films of oxide perovskites bring a novel landscape to their
properties and brings them one step closer to their application. It is
therefore of great importance to fully understand the inherent properties of
such films, in which dimensionality and surface effects can play a major role
in defining the properties of the materials ground state. This paper reports
the properties of freestanding (FS) films of the canonical oxide, SrTiO3 (STO)
with thicknesses 20, 30, 40 and 80 nm. We show that the relaxed ultrathin STO
FS films become polar at temperatures as high as 85 K, in contrast to the
quantum paraelectric behavior of bulk. Our findings are based on the softening
of the ferroelectric mode towards the ferroelectric transition temperature Tc
and its consecutive hardening below Tc with further decreasing temperature,
probed with THz time domain spectroscopy in transmission mode. We find almost
no thickness dependence in Tc. Moreover, we characterize the
antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase transition in STO FS by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
probing superlattice reflections characteristic for the rotation of the TiO6
octahedra. Our results point to a higher phase transition temperature in
comparison to bulk STO, as well as an unbalanced domain population favoring the
rotation axis to be in plane. X-ray linear dichroism results further show a
preferential Ti xz/yz orbital occupancy at the surface, but with a complete
degeneracy in the t2g states in the inner part of the film indicating that the
AFD distortion does not strongly affect the t2g splitting. These findings
demonstrate that STO FS films have clearly different properties than bulk.

<h3>Heterogeneous Peridynamic Neural Operators: Discover Biotissue  Constitutive Law and Microstructure From Digital Image Correlation  Measurements</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18597" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18597</a>

<p>Human tissues are highly organized structures with specific collagen fiber
arrangements varying from point to point. The effects of such heterogeneity
play an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to
discover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from
experimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this
end, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)
approach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic
materials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with
the material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation
field, from loading field-displacement field measurements. To this end, we
propose a two-phase learning approach. Firstly, we learn a homogeneous
constitutive law in the form of a neural network-based kernel function and a
nonlocal bond force, to capture complex homogeneous material responses from
data. Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the
kernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for
each material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our
HeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear
and angular momentum guaranteed. Moreover, the effects from heterogeneity and
nonlinear constitutive relationship are captured by the kernel function and the
bond force respectively, enabling physical interpretability. As a result, our
HeteroPNO architecture can learn a constitutive model for a biological tissue
with anisotropic heterogeneous response undergoing large deformation regime.
Moreover, the framework is capable to provide displacement and stress field
predictions for new and unseen loading instances.

<h3>Influence of interstitial Li on the electronic properties of  Li$_{x}$CsPbI$_{3}$ for photovoltaic and battery applications</h3>

</p><i>Wei Wei, Julian Gebhardt, Daniel F. Urban, Christian Elsässer</i>
<p>The integrated device of a perovskite solar cell with a Li-ion battery is an
innovative solution for decentralized energy storage in smart electronic
devices. In this study, we examine the stability of Li ions intercalated in a
CsPbI$_3$ perovskite and their effect on the electronic structure of
Li$_x$CsPbI$_3$ compounds using first-principles density functional theory. Our
simulations demonstrate that the insertion of Li at concentrations up to $x$ =
1 into CsPbI$_3$ is energetically possible. Moreover, we identify that the
distortion of the Pb-I octahedra has the strongest impact on the change in the
electronic band gap. Specifically, an increase in the amount of intercalated Li
causes larger structural distortions, which in turn lead to an increasing band
gap as function of the Li content.

<h3>Random Apollonian networks with tailored clustering coefficient</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18615" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18615</a>
<br>
</p><i>Eduardo M. K. Souza, Guilherme M. A. Almeida</i>
<p>We introduce a family of complex networks that interpolates between the
Apollonian network and its binary version, recently introduced in [Phys. Rev. E
\textbf{107}, 024305 (2023)], via random removal of nodes. The dilution process
allows the clustering coefficient to vary from $C=0.828$ to $C=0$ while
maintaining the behavior of average path length and other relevant quantities
as in the deterministic Apollonian network. Robustness against the random
deletion of nodes is also reported on spectral quantities such as the
ground-state localization degree and its energy gap to the first excited state.
The loss of the $2\pi / 3$ rotation symmetry as a tree-like network emerges is
investigated in the light of the hub wavefunction amplitude. Our findings
expose the interplay between the small-world property and other distinctive
traits exhibited by Apollonian networks, as well as their resilience against
random attacks.

</p><i>Niccolò Preti, Nicolò Antolini, Giulio Biagioni, Andrea Fioretti, Giovanni Modugno, Luca Tanzi, Carlo Gabbanini</i>
<p>Short-wavelength repulsive potentials for quantum gases allow to realize new
systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive
optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at
wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system
to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of
dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.
We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to
manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes
exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting
directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.

<h3>Exploring the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition in a  Two-dimensional Dipolar Bose Gas</h3>

</p><i>Yifei He, Ziting Chen, Haoting Zhen, Mingchen Huang, Mithilesh K Parit, Gyu-Boong Jo</i>
<p>Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions induce complex order in
quantum systems. It becomes particularly interesting in two-dimension (2D),
where the superfluidity with quasi-long-range order emerges via
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism, which still remains elusive
with dipolar interactions. Here, we observe the BKT transition from a normal
gas to the superfluid phase in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms.
Controlling the orientation of dipoles, we characterize the transition point by
monitoring extended coherence and measuring the equation of state. This allows
us to gain a systematic understanding of the BKT transition based on an
effective short-range description of dipolar interaction in 2D. Additionally,
we observe anisotropic density fluctuations and non-local effects in the
superfluid regime, which establishes the dipolar nature of the 2D superfluid.
Our results lay the ground for understanding the behavior of dipolar bosons in
2D and open up opportunities for examining complex orders in a dipolar
superfluid.

<h3>Building defect conformal field theory from the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev  interactions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yang Ge, Shao-Kai Jian</i>
<p>The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives
rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In
this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by
coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our
analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal
defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique
entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective
central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the
transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission
coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central
charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT
extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.

<h3>Collective excitations in competing phases in two and three dimensions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Joshua Althüser, Götz S. Uhrig</i>
<p>We investigate the superconducting (SC), charge-density wave (CDW), and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases in the extended Hubbard model at zero
temperature and half-filling. We employ the iterated equations of motion
approach to compute the two-particle Green's functions and their spectral
densities. This renders a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of collective
excitations possible as the model's parameters are tuned across phase
transitions. We identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) and phase
(Anderson-Bogoliubov) modes within the superconducting phase and observe a
similar excitation (cooperon) in the CDW phase which shifts towards zero energy
as the system approaches the phase transition to the SC phase. In the CDW
phase, close to the phase transition to the AFM phase, we find a collective
mode, an exciton, that does not change significantly and another mode, a
longitudinal magnon, that emerges from the two-particle continuum as the system
approaches the phase transition to the AFM phase. It becomes identical with the
former at the transition. In the AFM phase, their roles are reversed.
Additionally, we find a transversal Goldstone magnon located at zero energy.

<h3>Hydroflux-Controlled Growth of Magnetic K-Cu-Te-O(H) Phases</h3>

</p><i>Allana G. Iwanicki, Brandon Wilfong, Eli Zoghlin, Wyatt Bunstine, Maxime A. Siegler, Tyrel M. McQueen</i>
<p>Innovative synthetic approaches can yield new phases containing novel
structural and magnetic motifs. In this work, we show the synthesis and
magnetic characterization of three new and one previously reported layered
phase in the K-Cu-Te-O(H) phase space using a tunable hydroflux technique. The
hydroflux, with a roughly equal molar ratio of water and alkali hydroxide, is a
highly oxidizing, low melting solvent which can be used to isolate metastable
phases unattainable through traditional solid state or flux techniques. The
newly synthesized phases, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$
$\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, and K$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O,
contain Cu$^{2+}$ within CuO$_{4}$ square planar plaquettes and TeO$_{6}$
octahedra ordering to form structural honeycomb layers isolated by interlayer
K$^{+}$ ions and H$_{2}$O molecules. We find the synthesized structures display
varying tilt sequences of the CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes, leading to distinct
Cu$^{2+}$ magnetic motifs on the structural honeycomb lattice and a range of
effective magnetic dimensionalities. We find that K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$
$\cdot$ H$_{2}$O does not order and displays alternating chain Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior, while K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ and
K$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O order antiferromagnetically
(T$_{N}$ = 100 K and T$_{N}$ = 6.5 K respectively). The previously known phase,
K$_{2}$CuTeO$_{4}$(OH)$_{2}$ $\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, we find contains structurally
and magnetically one-dimensional CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes leading to uniform chain
Heisenberg AFM behavior and shows no magnetic order down to T = 0.4 K. We
discuss and highlight the usefulness of the hydroflux technique in novel
syntheses and the interesting magnetic motifs that arise in these particular
phases.

<p>Pyrrhotite, Fe$_7$S$_8$, provides an example of exceptionally strong
magnetoelastic coupling through pinning of ferromagnetic domains by
ferroelastic twins. Using direct imaging of both magnetic and ferroelastic
domains by magnetic force microscopy (MFM), the mechanism by which this
coupling controls local magnetic switching behaviour of regions on the
pyrrhotite surface is revealed, and leads to quantitative fitting of field
dependent MFM phase shifts with bulk magnetometry data. It is shown that
characteristic inflection points in the magnetometry data along certain
direction, in particular $[\overline 120]^*_h$ of the hexagonal parent
structure, are in fact caused by ferroelastic pinning of the magnetic moments.

</p><i>J. Kethepalli, M. Kulkarni, A. Kundu, S. N. Majumdar, D. Mukamel, G. Schehr</i>
<p>We investigate the full counting statistics (FCS) of a harmonically confined
1d short-range Riesz gas consisting of $N$ particles in equilibrium at finite
temperature. The particles interact with each other through a repulsive
power-law interaction with an exponent $k>1$ which includes the Calogero-Moser
model for $k=2$. We examine the probability distribution of the number of
particles in a finite domain $[-W, W]$ called number distribution, denoted by
$\mathcal{N}(W, N)$. We analyze the probability distribution of $\mathcal{N}(W,
N)$ and show that it exhibits a large deviation form for large $N$
characterised by a speed $N^{\frac{3k+2}{k+2}}$ and by a large deviation
function of the fraction $c = \mathcal{N}(W, N)/N$ of the particles inside the
domain and $W$. We show that the density profiles that create the large
deviations display interesting shape transitions as one varies $c$ and $W$.
This is manifested by a third-order phase transition exhibited by the large
deviation function that has discontinuous third derivatives. Monte-Carlo (MC)
simulations show good agreement with our analytical expressions for the
corresponding density profiles. We find that the typical fluctuations of
$\mathcal{N}(W, N)$, obtained from our field theoretic calculations are
Gaussian distributed with a variance that scales as $N^{\nu_k}$, with $\nu_k =
(2-k)/(2+k)$. We also present some numerical findings on the mean and the
variance. Furthermore, we adapt our formalism to study the index distribution
(where the domain is semi-infinite $(-\infty, W])$, linear statistics (the
variance), thermodynamic pressure and bulk modulus.

<h3>Structure and thermodynamics of supported lipid membranes on hydrophobic  van der Waals surfaces</h3>

<p>Understanding the adsorption and physical characteristics of supported lipid
membranes is crucial for their effective use as model cell membranes. Their
morphological and thermodynamic properties at the nanoscale have traditionally
been studied on hydrophilic substrates, such as mica and silicon oxide, which
have proved to facilitate the reconstruction of biomembranes. However, in more
recent years, with the advent of the van der Waals crystals technology,
two-dimensional crystals such as graphene have been proposed as potential
substrates in biosensing devices. Membranes formed on these crystals are
expected to behave differently owing to their intrinsic hydrophobicity, however
thus far knowledge of their morphological and thermodynamic properties is
lacking. Here we present a comprehensive nanoscale analysis of the adsorption
of phosphatidylcholine lipid monolayers on two of the most commonly used van
der Waals crystals, graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. Both morphological
and thermodynamic properties of the lipid membranes were investigated using
temperature-controlled atomic force microscopy. Our experiments show that the
lipids adsorb onto the crystals, forming monolayers with their orientation
dependent upon their concentration. Furthermore, we found that the
hydrophobicity of van der Waals crystals determines a strong increase in the
transition temperature of the lipid monolayer compared to that observed on
hydrophilic substrates. These results are important for understanding the
properties of lipid membranes at solid surfaces and extending their use to
novel drug delivery and biosensing devices made of van der Waals crystals.

<p>We consider a class of percolation models where the local occupation
variables have long-range correlations decaying as a power law $\sim r^{-a}$ at
large distances $r$, for some $0< a< d$ where $d$ is the underlying spatial
dimension. For several of these models, we present both, rigorous analytical
results and matching simulations that determine the critical exponents
characterizing the fixed point associated to their phase transition, which is
of second order. The exact values we obtain are rational functions of the two
parameters $a$ and $d$ alone, and do not depend on the specifics of the model.

</p><i>Eric R. Heller, David T. Limmer</i>
<p>Equilibrium rate theories play a crucial role in understanding rare, reactive
events. However, they are inapplicable to a range of irreversible processes in
systems driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium like active and biological
matter. Here, we develop a general, computationally efficient nonequilibrium
rate theory in the weak-noise limit based on an instanton approximation to the
stochastic path integral and illustrate its wide range of application in the
study of rare nonequilibrium events. We demonstrate excellent agreement of the
instanton rates with numerically exact results for a particle under a
non-conservative force. We also study phase transitions in an active field
theory. We elucidate how activity alters the stability of the two phases and
their rates of interconversion in a manner that can be well-described by
modifying classical nucleation theory

<h3>Signatures of electronic ordering in transport in graphene flat bands</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18817</a>
<br>
</p><i>Archisman Panigrahi, Leonid Levitov</i>
<p>Recently, a wide family of electronic orders was unveiled in graphene flat
bands, such as spin- and valley-polarized phases as well as nematic
momentum-polarized phases, stabilized by exchange interactions via a
generalized Stoner mechanism. Momentum polarization involves orbital degrees of
freedom and is therefore expected to impact resistivity in a way which is
uniquely sensitive to the ordering type. Under pocket polarization, carrier
distribution shifts in k space and samples the band mass in regions defined by
the displaced momentum distribution. This makes transport coefficients
sensitive to pocket polarization, resulting in the ohmic resistivity decreasing
with temperature. In addition, it leads to current switching and hysteresis
under strong E field. This behavior remains robust in the presence of
electron-phonon scattering and is therefore expected to be generic.
