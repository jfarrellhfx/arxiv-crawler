<h3>Engineering Dion-Jacobson Perovskites in Polariton Waveguides</h3>

Hybrid two-dimensional perovskites hold considerable promise as
semiconductors for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Many efforts
are addressed to exploit the potential of these materials by tailoring their
characteristics. In this work, the optical properties and electronic band
structure in three new Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites (PVKs) are engineered by
modulating their structural distortion. Two different interlayer cations: 1-6,
Hexamethylendiammonium, HE, and 3-(Dimethylamino)-1-propylammonium, DMPA, have
been selected to investigate the role of the cation length and the ammonium
binding group on the crystalline structure. This study provides new insights
into the understanding of the structure-property relationship in DJ perovskites
and demonstrates that exciton characteristics can be easily modulated with the
judicious design of the organic cations. DJ PVKs developed in this work were
also grown as size-controlled single crystal microwires through a
microfluidic-assisted synthesis technique and integrated in a nanophotonic
device. The DJ PVK microwire acts as a waveguide exhibiting strong light-matter
coupling between the crystal optical modes and DJ PVK exciton. Through the
investigation of these polariton waveguides, the nature of the double peak
emission, which is often observed in these materials and whose nature is
largely debated in the literature, is demonstrated originating from the hybrid
polariton state.

We continue our previous studies of the localized travelling waves, more
specifically, of the shocks and the kinks, propagating in the series-connected
Josephson transmission line (JTL). The paper consists of two parts. In the
first part we calculate the scattering of the "sound' (small amplitude small
wave vector harmonic wave) on the shock wave. In the second part we study the
similarities and the dissimilarities between the shocks and the kinks in the
lossy JTL. We also find the particular cases, when the nonlinear equation,
describing weak travelling wave in the lossy JTL can be integrated in terms of
elementary functions.

<h3>Singlet magnetism in intermetallic UGa$_2$ unveiled by inelastic x-ray  scattering</h3>

<br>
Using high resolution tender-x-ray resonant inelastic scattering and
hard-x-ray non-resonant inelastic scattering beyond the dipole limit we were
able to detect electronic excitations in intermetallic UGa$_2$ that are highly
atomic in nature. Analysis of the spectral lineshape reveals that the local
$5f^2$ configuration characterizes the correlated nature of this ferromagnet.
The orientation and directional dependence of the spectra indicate that the
ground state is made of the $\Gamma_1$ singlet and/or $\Gamma_6$ doublet
symmetry. With the ordered moment in the $ab$ plane, we infer that the
magnetism originates from the higher lying $\Gamma_6$ doublet being mixed with
the $\Gamma_1$ singlet due to inter-site exchange, qualifying UGa$_2$ to be a
true quantum magnet. The ability to observe atomic excitations is crucial to
resolve the on-going debate about the degree of localization versus itineracy
in U intermetallics.

<h3>Nematic metal in a multi-valley electron gas: Variational Monte Carlo  analysis and application to AlAs</h3>

The two-dimensional electron gas is of fundamental importance in quantum
many-body physics. We study a minimal extension of this model with $C_4$ (as
opposed to full rotational) symmetry and an electronic dispersion with two
valleys with anisotropic effective masses. Using variational Monte Carlo
simulations, we find a broad intermediate range of densities with a metallic
valley-polarized, spin-unpolarized ground-state. Our results are of direct
relevance to the recently discovered ``nematic'' state in AlAs quantum wells.
For the effective mass anisotropy relevant to this system, $m_x/m_y\approx
5.2$, we obtain a transition from an anisotropic metal to a valley-polarized
metal at $r_s \approx 12$ (where $r_s$ is the dimensionless Wigner-Seitz
radius). At still lower densities, we find a (possibly metastable) valley and
spin-polarized state with a reduced electronic anisotropy.

Two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold immense potential
for various applications due to their distinctive intrinsic properties compared
to their 3D analogues. Herein, we designed in silico a highly stable
NiF$_2$(pyrazine)$_2$ 2D MOF with a two-periodic wine-rack architecture.
Extensive first-principles calculations and Molecular Dynamics simulations
based on a newly developed machine learning potential (MLP) revealed that this
2D MOF exhibits huge in-plane Poisson's ratio anisotropy. This results into an
anomalous negative in-plane stretchability, as evidenced by an uncommon
decrease of its in-plane area upon the application of uniaxial tensile strain
that makes this 2D MOF particularly attractive for flexible wearable
electronics and ultra-thin sensor applications. We further demonstrated that
the derived MLP offers a unique opportunity to effectively anticipate the
finite temperature mechanical properties of MOFs at large scale. As a
proof-concept, MLP-based Molecular Dynamics simulations were successfully
achieved on 2D NiF$_2$(pyrazine)$_2$ with a dimension of 28.2$\times$28.2
nm$^2$ relevant to the length scale experimentally attainable for the
fabrication of MOF film.

<h3>Percolation transitions in the binary mixture of active Brownian  particles with different softness</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15144" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15144</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Homogeneous active Brownian particle (ABP) systems with purely repulsive
interactions are considered to have simple phase behavior, but various physical
attributes of active entities can lead to variation in the collective dynamics.
Recent studies have shown that even homogeneous ABPs exhibit complex behavior
due to an interplay between particle softness and motility. However, the
heterogeneity in composition of ABPs has not been explored yet. In this paper,
we study the structural properties of a binary mixture of ABPs with different
particle softness, by varying the relative softness and composition. We found
that upon varying the motility parameter, the system underwent a
motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) followed by a percolation transition
similar to the homogeneous systems; however, there is complex structure
formation within the dense phase of the MIPS which depends on the relative
softness of the binary system. Furthermore, the presence of a non-linear
scaling for different compositions of heterogeneous ABPs suggests that there is
a complex relationship between the composition and the structural properties.
Our study demonstrates that the composition heterogeneity of ABPs can also lead
to complex phase behavior.

<h3>Restoring permutational invariance in the Jordan-Wigner transformation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15149" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15149</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The Jordan-Wigner transformation is a powerful tool for converting systems of
spins into systems of fermions, or vice versa. While this mapping is exact, the
transformation itself depends on the labeling of the spins. One consequence of
this dependence is that approximate solutions of a Jordan-Wigner--transformed
Hamiltonian may depend on the (physically inconsequential) labeling of the
spins. In this work, we turn to an extended Jordan-Wigner transformation which
remedies this problem and which may also introduce some correlation atop the
Hartree-Fock solution of a transformed spin Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that
this extended Jordan-Wigner transformation can be thought of as arising from a
unitary version of the Lie algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) theory.
We show how these ideas, particularly in combination with the standard
(non-unitary) version of LAST, can provide a potentially powerful tool for the
treatment of the XXZ and $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonians.

<h3>Chiral Tunneling through Double Barrier Structure in Twisted Graphene  Bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15159</a>
<br>
<i>A. Bahlaoui, Y. Zahidi</i>
<br>
<br>
The paper discusses the chiral tunnelling of charge carriers through double
barrier structure in twisted graphene bilayer. The theoretical analysis
investigates the transmission probability for various system parameters under
both symmetric and asymmetric barrier conditions. The results reveal that the
transmission probability of quasiparticles in the $K$ cone is mirror symmetric
to that of $K_{\theta}$ cone about $\varphi =0$. Furthermore, the study shows
that the transmission changes gradually from perfect transmission to perfect
reflection in the normal direction by increasing the incident energy and the
barrier height, which is different from the case of monolayer and AB-stacked
bilayer graphene. It is also found that the double barrier structure remains,
only in certain cases, perfectly transparent for normal or near-normal
incidence. The chiral nature of the quasiparticles in graphene causes the
tunneling to be highly dependent on the direction and also on the double
barrier structure. Interestingly, this characteristic provides additional
parameter that allows us to tune the electronic properties of the twisted
graphene bilayer. Additionally, we found that the transmission exhibits some
sharp resonance peaks, the number and amplitude of which depend on the system
parameters. Our results provide a better understanding of the chiral tunnelling
in twisted graphene bilayer through double barrier structures and can help in
designing efficient electronic devices.

<h3>Majorana bound states in d-wave superconductor planar Josephson junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15162</a>
<br>
<i>Hamed Vakili, Moaz Ali, Mohamed Elekhtiar, Alexey A. Kovalev</i>
<br>
<br>
We study phase-controlled planar Josephson junction comprising a
two-dimensional electron gas with strong spin-orbit coupling and d-wave
superconductors, which have an advantage of high critical temperature. We show
that a region between the two superconductors can be tuned into topological
state by the in-plane Zeeman field, and can host Majorana bound states. The
phase diagram as a function of the Zeeman field, chemical potential, and the
phase difference between superconductors exhibits the appearance of robust
Majorana bound states for a wide range of parameters. We further investigate
the behavior of the topological gap and its dependence on the type of d-wave
pairing, i.e., d, d+is, or d+id', and note the difficulties that can arise due
to the presence of gapless excitations in pure d-wave superconductors. On the
other hand, the planar Josephson junctions based on superconductors with d+is
and d+id' pairings can potentially lead to realizations of Majorana bound
states. Our proposal can be realized in twisted bilayer d-wave superconductors
realizable in mechanically exfoliated van der Waals copper oxide
heterostructures.

<h3>Electrical coupling of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions mediated by  spin-transfer-torques</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15165" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15165</a>
<br>
<i>Leo Schnitzspan, Mathias Kläui, Gerhard Jakob</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, the effect of electrical coupling on stochastic switching of
two in-plane superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJs) is studied, using
experimental measurements as well as simulations. The coupling mechanism relies
on the spin-transfer-torque (STT) effect, which enables the manipulation of the
state probability of an SMTJ. Through the investigation of time-lagged
cross-correlation, the strength and direction of the coupling are determined.
In particular, the characteristic state probability transfer curve of each SMTJ
leads to the emergence of a similarity or dissimilarity effect. The
cross-correlation as a function of applied source voltage reveals that the
strongest coupling occurs for high positive voltages for our SMTJs. In
addition, we show state tuneability as well as coupling control by the applied
voltage. The experimental findings of the cross-correlation are in agreement
with our simulation results.

<h3>Assessing quantum dot SWAP gate fidelity using tensor network methods</h3>

<br>
<i>Jacob R. Taylor, Nathan L. Foulk, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
The SWAP gate facilitates the exchange of quantum states between qubits and
is integral to quantum algorithms. We utilize advanced tensor network methods
to explore the fidelity for repeated SWAP operations on a system comprising 20
to 100 quantum dot spin qubits. We incorporate valley states, valley splitting,
spin-valley coupling, Zeeman splitting, and crosstalk. The fidelity of SWAP
gates is largely unaffected by Zeeman splitting and valley splitting, except
when these parameters come into resonance. In addition to confirming that
fidelity is positively impacted by the larger exchange couplings
$J_\text{SWAP}$ in terms of the residual exchange $J_0$ and that spin-valley
coupling negatively impacts fidelity, we also show that for valley eigenstates,
the fidelity remains independent of the valley phase, while for generic valley
states some minor corrections arise. We also analyze the fidelity scaling for
long qubit chains without valley effects, where crosstalk represents the only
error source.

<h3>Increasing the Rate of Magnesium Intercalation Underneath Epitaxial  Graphene on 6H-SiC(0001)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnesium intercalated 'quasi-freestanding' bilayer graphene on 6H-SiC(0001)
(Mg-QFSBLG) has many favorable properties (e.g., highly n-type doped,
relatively stable in ambient conditions). However, intercalation of Mg
underneath monolayer graphene is challenging, requiring multiple intercalation
steps. Here, we overcome these challenges and subsequently increase the rate of
Mg intercalation by laser patterning (ablating) the graphene to form
micron-sized discontinuities. We then use low energy electron diffraction to
verify Mg-intercalation and conversion to Mg-QFSBLG, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy to determine the Mg intercalation rate for patterned and
non-patterned samples. By modeling Mg intercalation with the Verhulst equation,
we find that the intercalation rate increase for the patterned sample is
4.5$\pm$1.7. Since the edge length of the patterned sample is $\approx$5.2
times that of the non-patterned sample, the model implies that the increased
intercalation rate is proportional to the increase in edge length. Moreover, Mg
intercalation likely begins at graphene discontinuities in pristine samples
(not step edges or flat terraces), where the 2D-like crystal growth of
Mg-silicide proceeds. Our laser patterning technique may enable the rapid
intercalation of other atomic or molecular species, thereby expanding upon the
library of intercalants used to modify the characteristics of graphene, or
other 2D materials and heterostructures.

<h3>A universal equivariant graph neural network for the elasticity tensors  of any crystal system</h3>

<br>
<br>
The elasticity tensor that describes the elastic response of a material to
external forces is among the most fundamental properties of materials. The
availability of full elasticity tensors for inorganic crystalline compounds,
however, is limited due to experimental and computational challenges. Here, we
report the materials tensor (MatTen) model for rapid and accurate estimation of
the full fourth-rank elasticity tensors of crystals. Based on equivariant graph
neural networks, MatTen satisfies the two essential requirements for elasticity
tensors: independence of the frame of reference and preservation of material
symmetry. Consequently, it provides a universal treatment of elasticity tensors
for all crystal systems across diverse chemical spaces. MatTen was trained on a
dataset of first-principles elasticity tensors garnered by the Materials
Project over the past several years (we are releasing the data herein) and has
broad applications in predicting the isotropic elastic properties of
polycrystalline materials, examining the anisotropic behavior of single
crystals, and discovering new materials with exceptional mechanical properties.
Using MatTen, we have discovered a hundred new crystals with extremely large
maximum directional Young's modulus and eleven polymorphs of elemental cubic
metals with unconventional spatial orientation of Young's modulus.

<h3>Analysis of magneto-optical Kerr spectra of ferrimagnetic Mn$_4$N</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15246</a>
<br>
<i>Jan Zemen</i>
<br>
<br>
Simulations of magneto-optical Kerr effect in biaxially strained Mn$_4$N are
performed using density functional theory and linear response theory. We
consider three ferrimagnetic phases, two collinear and one noncollinear, which
have been corroborated separately by earlier studies. The simulated spectra are
compared to magneto-optical data available in recent literature. A collinear
ferrimagnetic phase with a small saturation magentization, a large
perpendicular anisotropy, and Curie temperature above 700~K is found to be
consistent with the measured spectra. We hypothesise that an admixture of the
noncollinear phase, which could explain the lower than predicted net moment and
magnetic anisotropy observed experimentally, is also present.

<h3>Field-Free Switching in Symmetry Breaking Multilayers: The Critical Role  of Interlayer Chiral Exchange</h3>

<i>Yung-Cheng Li, Yu-Hao Huang, Chao-Chung Huang, Yan-Ting Liu, Chi-Feng Pai</i>
<br>
<br>
It is crucial to realize field-free, deterministic, current-induced switching
in spin-orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). A tentative solution has emerged
recently, which employs the interlayer chiral exchange coupling or the
interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (i-DMI) to achieve symmetry
breaking. We hereby investigate the interlayer DMI in a Pt/Co multilayer system
with orthogonally magnetized layers, using repeatedly stacked [Pt/Co]n
structure with PMA, and a thick Co layer with in-plane magnetic anisotropy
(IMA). We clarify the origin and the direction of such symmetry breaking with
relation to the i-DMI effective field, and show a decreasing trend of the said
effective field magnitude to the stacking number (n). By comparing the
current-induced field-free switching behavior for both PMA and IMA layers, we
confirm the dominating role of i-DMI in such field-free switching, excluding
other possible mechanisms such as tilted-anisotropy and unconventional spin
currents that may have arisen from the symmetry breaking.

<h3>Reversible magnetic domain reorientation induced by magnetic field  pulses with fixed direction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nanoscale magnetic domains with controllable configurations could be used for
classical and quantum applications, where the switching of magnetization
configurations is an essential operation for information processing. Here, we
report that the magnetic domain reorientation in a notched ferromagnetic
nanotrack can be realized and effectively controlled by applying uniform
magnetic field pulses in a fixed in-plane direction perpendicular to the
nanotrack. Our micromagnetic simulation results show that the configurations of
magnetic domains in the notched nanotrack can be switched between a
head-to-head state and a tail-to-tail state in a reversible manner driven by
magnetic field pulses, while it is unnecessary to reverse the direction of the
magnetic field. Such a unique magnetic domain reorientation dynamics is found
to depend on magnetic parameters and nanotrack geometries. The reorientation
dynamics of magnetic domains also depends on the strength and length of the
applied magnetic field pulse. In addition, we point out that the notches at the
center of the nanotrack play an important role for the stabilization of the
head-to-head and tail-to-tail states during the magnetic domain reorientation.
We also qualitatively explain the field-induced reorientation phenomenon with a
simplified two-dimensional macrospin model. Our results may make it possible to
build spintronic devices driven by a fixed magnetic field. Our findings may
also motivate future studies to investigate the classical and quantum
applications based on nanoscale magnetic domains.

<h3>The First Direct Detection of Kirkwood Transitions in Concentrated  Aqueous Electrolytes using Small Angle X-ray Scattering</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ion-ion correlations, screening, and equilibrium bulk structure in various
concentrated electrolytes are investigated using synchrotron small angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS), theory, and molecular simulation. Utilizing SAXS
measurements we provide estimates of the Kirkwood Transition (KT) for a variety
of aqueous electrolytes (NaCl, CaCl$_2$, SrCl$_2$, and ErCl$_3$). The KT may be
defined as the concentration above which the ion-ion correlations cease to
decay exponentially with a single length scale given by the Debye length
$\lambda_{\rm D}$ and develop an additional length scale, $d=2\pi/Q_0$ that
reflects the formation of local domains of charge. Theoretical models of the KT
have been known for decades for highly idealized models of electrolytes, but
experimental verification of KT in real electrolytes has yet to be confirmed.
Herein, we provide consistent theoretical and experimental estimates of both
the inverse screening lengths $a_0$ and inverse domain size, $Q_0$ for the
aforementioned electrolyte systems. Taken together, $a_0$ and $Q_0$ are known
descriptors of the KT and provide a view into the complexity of ion-ion
interaction beyond the well-accepted Debye-H\"{u}ckel limit. Our findings
suggest a picture of interaction for real electrolytes that is more general
than that found in idealized models that is manifest in the precise form of the
non-local response function that we estimate through the interpretation of the
experimental SAXS signal. Importantly, the additional complexity of describing
ion-ion interaction of real electrolytes will implicate the short-range ion-ion
interactions that can only be computed via molecular simulation and provide a
quantitative approach to describe electrolyte phenomena beyond Debye-H\"{u}ckel
theory.

<h3>Plastic avalanches in metal-organic framework crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
The compressive properties of metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals are not
only crucial for their densification but also key in determining their
performance in many applications. We herein investigated the mechanical
responses of a classic crystalline MOF, HKUST-1 by using in situ compression
tests. A serrated flow accompanied by the unique strain avalanches was found in
individual and contacting crystals before their final flattening or fracture
with splitting cracks. The plastic flow with serrations is ascribed to the
dynamic phase mixing due to the progressive and irreversible local phase
transition in HKUST-1 crystals, as revealed by molecular dynamics and finite
element simulations. Such pressure-induced phase coexistence in HKUST-1
crystals also induces a significant loading-history dependence of their Young's
modulus. The observation of plastic avalanches in HKUST-1 crystals here not
only expands our current understanding of the plasticity of MOF crystals but
also unveils a novel mechanism for the avalanches and plastic flow in crystal
plasticity.

<h3>Structural phase transition, $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and magnetic stripe  order in the bilayered nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under  pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15276" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15276</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recently discovered high-temperature superconductor
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we comprehensively study this system using
density functional theory and the random phase approximation (RPA), focusing on
pressure effects. At low pressures, the Amam phase is stable, containing the
Y$^{2-}$ mode distortion from the Fmmm phase, while the Fmmm phase is unstable.
Because of small differences in enthalpy and a considerable Y$^{2-}$ mode
amplitude, the two phases may coexist in the range between 10.6 and 14 Gpa,
beyond which the Fmmm phase dominates. In addition, our density functional
theory and RPA calculations found that the magnetic stripe-type spin order with
wavevector ($\pi$, 0) becomes stable at intermediate Hubbard and Hund
couplings. Pairing is induced in the $s_{\pm}$-wave channel due to nesting
between the {\bf M}=$(\pi,\pi)$ and the {\bf X}=$(\pi,0)$ and {\bf Y}=$(0,\pi)$
points in the Brillouin zone. This order resembles results for iron-based
superconductors, but for the nickelate of our focus the orbital $d_{3z^2-r^2}$
dominates, establishing a fundamental difference with iron pnictides and
selenides. Within RPA, we predict that the critical temperature will
substantially increase if the Fmmm phase is stabilized at lower pressures than
currently achieved, via strain or growing on appropriate substrates, in
agreement with tendencies in recent experimental results.

The study of the ultracold atomic spin systems with long-range interaction
provides the possibility to search for magnetic supersolid phases in quantum
many-body scenarios. In this paper, we consider two-species Bose gases with
spin-orbit coupling and nearest-neighbor interaction confined in a
two-dimensional optical lattice. The competition between SOC and interactions
creates rich ground-state diagrams with supersolid phase exhibiting the phase
modulation or magnetic ordering. The combined effect of intraspecies
nearest-neighbor interaction and spin-orbit coupling results in the
phase-twisted paired checkboard supersolid and phase-striped paired checkboard
supersolid phases. The introduction of interspecies nearest-neighbor
interaction enriches the quantum phases of the system. The phase-twisted
lattice supersolid and phase-striped lattice supersolid phases are preferred.
We find that the appearance of some ground-state phases depending on
interspecies on-site interaction. A type of lattice supersolid phase with
supersolid in one spin species but insulating in the other that exists in the
miscible domain, while the paired stripe supersolid phase with stripe
structures in each spin species in the immiscible domain. Finally, to further
characterize each phase, we discuss their spin-dependent momentum distributions
and spin-texture structures. The magnetic textures such as antiferromagnetic,
spiral and stripe orders are shown in supersolid phases. The results here in
could help in the observe for these magnetic supersolid phases in ultracold
atomic experiments with nearest-neighbor interaction and spin-orbit coupling in
optical lattice.

<br>
<br>
We studied Ni50+xTi50-x with compositions up to x = 2, performing 47Ti and
49Ti nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements from 4 K to 400 K. For large
x in this system, a strain-glass appears in which frozen ferroelastic
nano-domains replace the displacive martensite structural transition. Here we
demonstrate that NMR can provide an extremely effective probe of the strain
glass freezing process, with large changes in NMR line-shape due to the effects
of random strains which become motionally narrowed at high temperatures. At the
same time with high-resolution x-ray diffraction we confirm the lack of
structural changes in x >= 1.2 samples, while we show that there is little
change in the electronic behavior across the strain glass freezing temperature.
NMR spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) measurements provide a further measure of
the dynamics of the freezing process, and indicate a predominantly thermally
activated behavior both above and below the strain-glass freezing temperature.
We show that the strain glass results are consistent with a very small density
of critically divergent domains undergoing a Vogel-Fulcher-type freezing
process, coexisting with domains exhibiting faster dynamics and stronger
pinning.

<br>
<br>
We generate compact localized states in an electrical diamond lattice,
comprised of only capacitors and inductors, via local driving near its flatband
frequency. We compare experimental results to numerical simulations and find
very good agreement. We also examine the stub lattice, which features a
flatband of a different class where neighboring compact localized states share
lattice sites. We find that local driving, while exciting the lattice at that
flatband frequency, is unable to isolate a single compact localized state due
to their non-orthogonality. Finally, we introduce lattice nonlinearity and
showcase the realization of nonlinear compact localized states in the diamond
lattice. Our findings pave the way of applying flatband physics to complex
electric circuit dynamics.

<h3>The nature of hypergraph $k$-core percolation problems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15346" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15346</a>
<br>
<i>Ginestra Bianconi, Sergey N. Dorogovtsev</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop the theory of $k$-cores in hypergraphs based on the assumption
that a hyperedge can only be intact if all its nodes are undamaged. This
scenario applies for instance to supply chains where the production of a
product requires all raw materials and all processing steps; in biology it
applies to protein-interaction networks where protein complexes can only
function if all the proteins are present, and it applies as well to chemical
reaction networks where a chemical reaction can take place only when all the
reactants are present. Formulating a message-passing theory for hypergraph
$k$-core percolation, and combining it with the theory of critical phenomena on
networks we demonstrate that the set of $k$-core problems for locally tree-like
hypergraphs is much richer than for ordinary graphs. In particular we define a
pruning process acting on nodes as well as on hyperedges depending on their
connectivity and we demonstrate sharp differences with previously studied
factor graph $k$-core percolation processes where it is allow for hyperedges to
have one or more damaged nodes and still be intact. Furthermore we define a set
of pruning processes that act either exclusively on nodes or exclusively on
hyperedges and depend of their second-neighborhood connectivity. We show that
the resulting second-neighbor $k$-core percolation problems are significantly
distinct with each other and we reveal their relation to hypergraph and factor
graph $k$-core percolation problems.

<h3>Simple solvable models with strong long-range correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15351" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15351</a>
<br>
<i>Marco Biroli, Hernán Larralde, Satya N. Majumdar, Grégory Schehr</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a set of $N$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)
random variables $\{X_1,\, X_2,\ldots, X_N\}$ whose common distribution has a
parameter $Y$ (or a set of parameters) which itself is random with its own
distribution. For a fixed value of this parameter $Y$, the $X_i$ variables are
independent and we call them conditionally independent and identically
distributed (c.i.i.d). However, once integrated over the distribution of the
parameter $Y$, the $X_i$ variables get strongly correlated, yet retaining a
solvable structure for various observables, such as for the sum and the
extremes of $X_i$'s. This provides a simple recipe to generate a class of
solvable strongly correlated systems. We illustrate how this recipe works via
three physical examples where $N$ particles on a line perform independent (i)
Brownian motions, (ii) ballistic motions with random initial velocities, and
(iii) L\'evy flights, but they get strongly correlated via simultaneous
resetting to the origin. Our results are verified in numerical simulations.
This recipe can be used to generate an endless variety of solvable strongly
correlated systems.

<h3>Berezinskii approach to disordered spin systems with asymmetric  scattering and application to the quantum boomerang effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15354" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15354</a>
<br>
<i>Jakub Janarek, Nicolas Cherroret, Dominique Delande</i>
<br>
<br>
We extend the Berezinskii diagrammatic technique to one-dimensional
disordered spin systems, in which time-reversal invariance is broken due to a
spin-orbit coupling term inducing left-right asymmetric scattering. We then use
this formalism to theoretically describe the dynamics of the quantum boomerang
effect, a recently discovered manifestation of Anderson localization. The
theoretical results are confirmed by exact numerical simulations of wave-packet
dynamics in a random potential.

<h3>Nonreciprocal charge transport and subharmonic structure in  voltage-biased Josephson diodes</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study charge transport in voltage-biased single-channel junctions
involving helical superconductors with finite Cooper pair momentum. For a
Josephson junction, the equilibrium current-phase relation shows a
superconducting diode effect: the critical current depends on the propagation
direction. We formulate a scattering theory for voltage-biased Josephson diodes
and show that multiple Andreev reflection processes cause a rich subharmonic
structure in the DC current-voltage curve at low temperatures and small
voltages which can be understood by accounting for Doppler shifts of the
spectral gap. We study Josephson diodes both in and out of equilibrium, in
particular the dependence of the nonlinear conductance (which determines the
rectification efficiency) on the contact transparency and on the Cooper pair
momentum. We also discuss charge transport for NS junctions between a normal
metal and a helical superconductor and comment on related models with
spin-orbit interactions and magnetic Zeeman fields.

<h3>Electronic structure and lattice dynamics of 1T-VSe$_2$: origin of the  3D-CDW</h3>

<br>
<br>
In order to characterize in detail the charge density wave (CDW) transition
of 1$T$-VSe$_2$, its electronic structure and lattice dynamics are
comprehensively studied by means of x-ray diffraction, angle resolved
photoemission (ARPES), diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), and
state-of-the-art first principles density functional theory calculations.
Resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS) does not show any resonant enhancement
at either V or Se K-edges, indicating that the CDW peak describes a purely
structural modulation of the electronic ordering. ARPES identifies (i) a
pseudogap at T$>$T$_{CDW}$, which leads to a depletion of the density of states
in the $ML-M'L'$ plane at T$<$T$_{CDW}$, and (ii) anomalies in the electronic
dispersion reflecting a sizable impact of phonons on it. A diffuse scattering
precursor, characteristic of soft phonons, is observed at room temperature (RT)
and leads to the full collapse of the low-energy phonon ($\omega_1$) with
propagation vector (0.25 0 -0.3) r.l.u. We show that the frequency and
linewidth of this mode are anisotropic in momentum space, reflecting the
momentum dependence of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI), hence
demonstrating that the origin of the CDW is, to a much larger extent, due to
the momentum dependence EPI with a small contribution from nesting. The
pressure dependence of the $\omega_1$ soft mode remains nearly constant up to
13 GPa at RT, with only a modest softening before the transition to the
high-pressure monoclinic $C2/m$ phase. The wide set of experimental data are
well captured by our state-of-the art first-principles anharmonic calculations
with the inclusion of van der Waals (vdW) corrections in the
exchange-correlation functional. The description of the electronics and
dynamics of VSe$_2$ reported here adds important pieces of information to the
understanding of the electronic modulations of TMDs.

<br>
<br>
The development of van der Waals heterostructures has introduced
unconventional phenomena that emerge at atomically precise interfaces. For
example, interlayer excitons in two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides show intriguing optical properties at low temperatures. Here we
report on room-temperature observation of interface excitons in
mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of two-dimensional tungsten
diselenide and one-dimensional carbon nanotubes. Bright emission peaks
originating from the interface are identified, spanning a broad energy range
within the telecommunication wavelengths. The effect of band alignment is
investigated by systematically varying the nanotube bandgap, and we assign the
new peaks to interface excitons as they only appear in type-II
heterostructures. Room-temperature localization of low-energy interface
excitons is indicated by extended lifetimes as well as small excitation
saturation powers, and photon correlation measurements confirm single-photon
emission. With mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures where band
alignment can be engineered, new opportunities for quantum photonics are
envisioned.

<h3>Electron-induced non-monotonic pressure dependence of the lattice  thermal conductivity of θ-TaN</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15407" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15407</a>
<br>
<i>Ashis Kundu, Yani Chen, Xiaolong Yang, Fanchen Meng, Jesús Carrete, Mukul Kabir, Georg K. H. Madsen, Wu Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent theoretical and experimental research suggests that $\theta$-TaN is a
semimetal with high thermal conductivity ($\kappa$), primarily due to the
contribution of phonons ($\kappa_\texttt{ph}$). By using first-principles
calculations, we show a non-monotonic pressure-dependence of the $\kappa$ of
$\theta$-TaN. $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ first increases until it reaches a maximum
at around 60 GPa, and then decreases. This anomalous behaviour is a consequence
of the competing pressure responses of phonon-phonon and phonon-electron
interactions, in contrast to the other known materials BAs and BP, where the
non-monotonic pressure dependence is caused by the interplay between different
phonon-phonon scattering channels. Although TaN has similar phonon dispersion
features to BAs at ambient pressure, its response to pressure is different and
an overall stiffening of the phonon branches takes place. Consequently, the
relevant phonon-phonon scattering weakens as pressure increases. However, the
increased electronic density of states around the Fermi level significantly
enhances phonon-electron scattering at high pressures, driving a decrease in
$\kappa_{\mathrm{ph}}$. At intermediate pressures ($\sim$20$-$70 GPa), the
$\kappa$ of TaN surpasses that of BAs. Our work provides deeper insight into
phonon transport in semimetals and metals where phonon-electron scattering is
relevant.

<h3>Magnetic-field periodic quantum Sondheimer oscillations in thin-film  graphite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15418" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15418</a>
<br>
<i>Toshihiro Taen, Andhika Kiswandhi, Toshihito Osada</i>
<br>
<br>
Materials with the mesoscopic scales have provided an excellent platform for
quantum-mechanical studies. Among them, the periodic oscillations of the
electrical resistivity against the direct and the inverse of the magnetic
fields, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Shubnikov-de Haas effect,
manifest the interference of the wavefunction relevant to the electron motion
perpendicular to the magnetic field. In contrast, the electron motion along the
magnetic field also leads to the magnetic-field periodicity, which is the
so-called Sondheimer effect. However, the Sondheimer effect has been understood
only in the framework of the semiclassical picture, and thereby its
interpretation at the quasiquantum limit was not clear. Here, we show that
thin-film graphite exhibits clear sinusoidal oscillations with a period of
about 1-3 T over a wide range of the magnetic fields (from around 10 T to 30
T), where conventional quantum oscillations are absent. In addition, the sample
with a designed step in the middle for eliminating the stacking disorder effect
verifies that the period of the oscillations is inversely proportional to the
thickness, which supports the emergence of the Sondheimer oscillations in the
quasiquantum limit. These findings suggest that the Sondheimer oscillations can
be reinterpreted as inter-Landau-level resonances even at the field range where
the semiclassical picture fails. Our results expand the quantum oscillation
family, and pave the way for the exploration of the out-of-plane wavefunction
motion.

<h3>Absence of the anomalous Hall effect in planar Hall experiments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15420" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15420</a>
<br>
<i>C. M. Wang, Z. Z. Du, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, the planar Hall effect has attracted tremendous interest. In
particular, an in-plane magnetization can induce an anomalous planar Hall
effect with a $2\pi/3$ period for hexagon-warped energy bands. This effect is
similar to the anomalous Hall effect resulting from an out-of-plane
magnetization. However, this anomalous planar Hall effect is absent in the
planar Hall experiments. Here, we explain its absence, by performing a
calculation that includes not only the Berry curvature mechanism as those in
the previous theories, but also the disorder contributions. The conventional
$\pi$-period planar Hall effect will occur if the mirror reflection symmetry is
broken, which buries the anomalous one. We show that an in-plane strain can
enhance the anomalous Hall conductivity and changes the period from $2\pi/3$ to
$2\pi$. We propose a scheme to extract the hidden anomalous planar Hall
conductivity from the experimental data. Our work will be helpful in detecting
the anomalous planar Hall effect and could be generalized to understand
mechanisms of the planar Hall effects in a wide range of materials.

We explore phase behaviour of a binary colloidal system under external
spatially periodic modulation. We perform Monte Carlo simulation on a binary
mixture of big and small repulsive Lennard-Jones particles with diameter ratio
1:2. We characterise structure by isotropic and anisotropic pair correlation
function, cluster size distribution, bond angle distribution, order parameter
and specific heat. We observe demixing of the species in the absence of the
external modulation. However, mixing of the species gets enhanced with
increasing potential strength. The de-mixing order parameter shows
discontinuity and the specific heat shows a peak with increasing modulation
strength, characterizing a first order phase transition.

Equilibrium thermodynamics describes the energy exchange of a body with its
environment. Here, we describe the global energy exchange of an ideal gas in
the Coutte flow in a thermodynamic-like manner. We derive a fundamental
relation between internal energy as a function of parameters of state. We
analyze a non-equilibrium transition in the system and postulate the extremum
principle, which determines stable stationary states in the system. The
steady-state thermodynamic framework resembles equilibrium thermodynamics.

<h3>Revisiting Néel 60 years on: the magnetic anisotropy of  $\mathrm{L}1_0$ FeNi (tetrataenite)</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of atomically ordered
$\mathrm{L}1_0$ FeNi (the meteoritic mineral tetrataenite) is studied within a
first-principles electronic structure framework. Two compositions are examined:
equiatomic Fe$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$ and an Fe-rich composition,
Fe$_{0.56}$Ni$_{0.44}$. It is confirmed that, for the single crystals modelled
in this work, the leading-order anisotropy coefficient $K_1$ dominates the
higher-order coefficients $K_2$ and $K_3$. To enable comparison with
experiment, the effects of both imperfect atomic long-range order and finite
temperature are included. While our computational results initially appear to
undershoot the measured experimental values for this system, careful scrutiny
of the original analysis due to N\'{e}el et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 35, 873 (1964)]
suggests that our computed value of $K_1$ is, in fact, consistent with
experimental values, and that the noted discrepancy has its origins in the
nanoscale polycrystalline, multivariant nature of experimental samples, that
yields much larger values of $K_2$ and $K_3$ than expected a priori. These
results provide fresh insight into the existing discrepancies in the literature
regarding the value of tetrataenite's uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy in
both natural and synthetic samples.

<h3>Non-Hermitian phase-biased Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by conventional
superconductors with a finite phase difference under non-Hermiticity naturally
appearing due to coupling to normal reservoirs. Depending on the structure of
non-Hermiticity, captured here in terms of retarded self-energies, the
low-energy spectrum hosts topologically stable exceptional points either at
zero or finite real energies as a function of the superconducting phase
difference. Interestingly, we find that the corresponding phase-biased
supercurrents acquire divergent profiles at such exceptional points, an
instance that turns out to be a natural and unique non-Hermitian effect that
signals a possible way to enhance the sensitivity of Josephson junctions. Our
work thus opens the way for realizing unique non-Hermitian phenomena due to the
interplay between non-Hermitian topology and the Josephson effect.

<br>
Optimal control is a valuable tool for quantum simulation, allowing for the
optimized preparation, manipulation, and measurement of quantum states. Through
the optimization of a time-dependent control parameter, target states can be
prepared to initialize or engineer specific quantum dynamics. In this work, we
focus on the tailoring of a unitary evolution leading to the stroboscopic
stabilization of quantum states of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical
lattice. We show how, for states with space and time symmetries, such an
evolution can be derived from the initial state-preparation controls; while for
a general target state we make use of quantum optimal control to directly
generate a stabilizing Floquet operator. Numerical optimizations highlight the
existence of a quantum speed limit for this stabilization process, and our
experimental results demonstrate the efficient stabilization of a broad range
of quantum states in the lattice.

We revisit the one-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising spin-chain with a finite
number of spins and periodic boundaries and derive analytically and verify
numerically its various stationary and dynamical properties at different
temperatures. In particular, we determine the probability distributions of
magnetization, the number of domain walls, and the corresponding residence
times for different chain lengths and magnetic fields. While we study finite
systems at thermal equilibrium, we identify several critical temperatures
similar to those for first-order phase transitions. At critical temperature
$T_{cr}^{(1)}$ the ferromagnetic state emerges as a metastable state, while at
$T_{cr}^{(2)}\leq T_{cr}^{(1)}$ it acquires the same probability as the
paramagnetic state. These two critical temperature merge for sufficiently
strong magnetic field that polarizes the spins. We also identify a dynamical
critical temperature $T_{cr}^{(\mathrm{d})}> T_{cr}^{(1)}$ below which the
ferromagnetic state has longer residence time, and thus is dynamically more
stable, than the paramagnetic state. We illustrate the utility of our results
by their application to structural transitions in biopolymers having
non-trivial intermediate equilibrium states.

<br>
Acoustic metamaterials, particularly the topological insulators, exhibit
exceptional wave characteristics that have sparked considerable research
interest. The study of imperfect interfaces affect is of significant importance
for the modeling of wave propagation behavior in topological insulators. This
paper models a soft Rayleigh beam system with imperfect interfaces, and
investigates its topological phase transition process tuned by mechanical
loadings. The model reveals that the topological phase transition process can
be observed by modifying the distance between imperfect interfaces in the
system. When a uniaxial stretch is applied, the topological phase transition
points for longitudinal waves decrease within a limited frequency range, while
they increase within a larger frequency scope for transverse waves. Enhancing
the rigidity of the imperfect interfaces also enables shifting of the
topological phase transition point within a broader frequency range for
longitudinal waves and a confined range for transverse waves. The transition of
topologically protected interface modes in the transmission performance of a
twenty-cell system is verified, which include altering frequencies, switching
from interface mode to edge mode. Overall, this study provides a new approach
and guideline for controlling topological phase transition in composite and
soft phononic crystal systems.

<h3>Machine Learning Potential for Modelling H$_2$ Adsorption/Diffusion in  MOF with Open Metal Sites</h3>

<br>
<br>
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating open metal sites (OMS) have
been identified as promising sorbents for many societally relevant-adsorption
applications including CO$_2$ capture, natural gas purification and H$_2$
storage. It is critical to derive generic interatomic potential to achieve
accurate and effective evaluation of MOFs for H$_2$ adsorption. On this path,
as a proof-of-concept, the Al-soc-MOF containing Al-OMS, previously envisaged
as a potential candidate for H$_2$ adsorption, was selected and a machine
learning potential (MLP) was derived from a dataset initially generated by
ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This MLP was further
implemented in MD simulations to explore the binding modes of H$_2$ as well as
its temperature dependence distribution in the MOFs pores from 10K to 90K.
MLP-Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were further performed to
predict the H$_2$ sorption isotherm of Al-soc-MOF at 77K that was further
confirmed by gravimetric sorption measurements. As a further step, MLP-based MD
simulations were conducted to anticipate the kinetics of H$_2$ in this MOF.
This work delivers the first MLP able to describe accurately the interactions
between the challenging H$_2$ guest molecule and MOFs containing OMS. This
innovative strategy applied to one of the most complex molecules owing to its
highly polarizable nature alongside its quantum-mechanical effects that are
only accurately described by quantum calculations, paves the way towards a more
systematic accurate and efficient in silico assessment of the MOFs containing
OMS for H$_2$ adsorption and beyond to the low-pressure capture/sensing of
diverse molecules.

<h3>A new approach to analyzing the spinor wave functions: Effect of strain  on the electronic structure and optical transitions in bulk CdSe</h3>

<i>A. I. Lebedev</i>
<br>
<br>
An approach to analyzing the spinor wave functions that appear in the
electronic structure calculations when taking the spin-orbit interaction into
account is developed. It is based on the projection analysis of angular parts
of wave functions onto irreducible representations of the point group and
analysis of the evolution of the energy levels upon the adiabatic turning on
the spin-orbit interaction. The technique is illustrated by an example of the
changes in the valence band structure in strained bulk CdSe with zinc-blende
structure. An analysis of the character of mixing of various branches of the
valence band supports the Luttinger-Kohn model of the valence band. It is shown
that the above calculations complemented by the Zeeman splitting in a magnetic
field make it possible to unambiguously determine the polarization of all
optical transitions. Using the spinor wave functions, matrix elements of
optical transitions between the valence subbands and the conduction band are
calculated.

While the collective dynamics of spherical active Brownian particles is
relatively well understood by now, the much more complex dynamics of
nonspherical active particles still raises interesting open questions. Previous
work has shown that the dynamics of rod-like or ellipsoidal active particles
can differ significantly from that of spherical ones. Here, we obtain the full
state diagram of active Brownian ellipsoids depending on the P\'eclet number
and packing density via computer simulations. The system is found to exhibit a
rich state behavior that includes cluster formation, local polar order, polar
flocks, and disordered states. Moreover, we obtain numerical results and an
analytical representation for the pair-distribution function of active
ellipsoids. This function provides useful quantitative insights into the
collective behavior of active particles with lower symmetry and has potential
applications in the development of predictive theoretical models.

Relative entropy is a powerful measure of the dissimilarity between two
statistical field theories in the continuum. In this work, we study the
relative entropy between Gaussian scalar field theories in a finite volume with
different masses and boundary conditions. We show that the relative entropy
depends crucially on $d$, the dimension of Euclidean space. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the mutual information between two disjoint regions in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is finite if and only if the two regions are separated by a
finite distance. We argue that the properties of mutual information in scalar
field theories can be explained by the Markov property of these theories.

In the presented work we study, by means of numerical simulations, the
behaviour of a suspension of active ring polymers in the bulk and under lateral
confinement. When changing the separation between the confining planes and the
polymers' density, we detect the emergence of a self-organised dynamical state,
characterised by the coexistence of slowly diffusing clusters of rotating disks
and faster rings moving in between them. This system represents a peculiar case
at the crossing point between polymer, liquid crystals and active matter
physics, where the interplay between activity, topology and confinement leads
to a spontaneous segregation of a one component solution.

Weyl semimetals have emerged as a promising quantum material system to
discover novel electrical and optical phenomena, due to their combination of
nontrivial quantum geometry and strong symmetry breaking. One crucial class of
such novel transport phenomena is the diode effect, which is of great interest
for both fundamental physics and modern technologies. In the electrical regime,
giant electrical diode effect (the nonreciprocal transport) has been observed
in Weyl systems. In the optical regime, novel optical diode effects have been
theoretically considered but never probed experimentally. Here, we report the
observation of the nonlinear optical diode effect (NODE) in the magnetic Weyl
semimetal CeAlSi, where the magnetic state of CeAlSi introduces a pronounced
directionality in the nonlinear optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). By
physically reversing the beam path, we show that the measured SHG intensity can
change by at least a factor of six between forward and backward propagation
over a wide bandwidth exceeding 250 meV. Supported by density-functional theory
calculations, we establish the linearly dispersive bands emerging from Weyl
nodes as the origin of the extreme bandwidth. Intriguingly, the NODE
directionality is directly controlled by the direction of magnetization. By
utilizing the electronically conductive semimetallic nature of CeAlSi, we
demonstrate current-induced magnetization switching and thus electrical control
of the NODE in a mesoscopic spintronic device structure with current densities
as small as 5 kA/cm$^2$. Our results advance ongoing research to identify novel
nonlinear optical/transport phenomena in magnetic topological materials. The
NODE also provides a way to measure the phase of nonlinear optical
susceptibilities and further opens new pathways for the unidirectional
manipulation of light such as electrically controlled optical isolators.

<h3>A quantitative phase-field model for void evolution in defect  supersaturated environments: a novel introduction of defect reaction  asymmetry</h3>

Voids develop in crystalline materials under energetic particle irradiation,
as in nuclear reactors. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of void
nucleation and growth is of utmost importance as it leads to dimensional
instability of the metallic materials. In the past two decades, researchers
have adopted the phase-field approach to study the phenomena of void evolution
under irradiation. The approach involves modeling the boundary between the void
and matrix with a diffused interface. However, none of the existing models are
quantitative in nature. This work introduces a thermodynamically consistent,
quantitative diffuse interface model based on KKS formalism to describe the
void evolution under irradiation. The model concurrently considers both
vacancies and self-interstitials in the description of void evolution. Unique
to our model is the presence of two mobility parameters in the equation of
motion of the phase-field variable. The two mobility parameters relate the
driving force for vacancy and self-interstitial interaction to the interface
motion, analogous to dislocation motion through climb and glide processes. The
asymptotic matching of the phase-field model with the sharp-interface theory
fixes the two mobility parameters in terms of the material parameters in the
sharp-interface model. The Landau coefficient, which controls the height of the
double-well function in the phase field variable, and the gradient coefficient
of the phase field variable are fixed based on the interfacial energy and
interface width of the boundary. With all the parameters in the model
determined in terms of the material parameters, we thus have a new phase field
model for void evolution. Simple test cases will show the void evolution under
various defect supersaturation to validate our new phase-field model.

<br>
<br>
The Zintl compound AIn2X2 (A = Ca, Sr, and X = P, As), as a theoretically
predicted new non-magnetic topological insulator, requires experiments to
understand their electronic structure and topological characteristics. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the crystal structures and electronic
properties of the Zintl compound SrIn2As2 under both ambient and high-pressure
conditions. Based on systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurements, we observed the topological surface states on its (001)
surface as predicted by calculations, indicating that SrIn2As2 is a strong
topological insulator. Interestingly, application of pressure effectively tuned
the crystal structure and electronic properties of SrIn2As2. Superconductivity
is observed in SrIn2As2 for pressure where the temperature dependence of the
resistivity changes from a semiconducting-like behavior to that of a metal. The
observation of nontrivial topological states and pressure-induced
superconductivity in SrIn2As2 provides crucial insights into the relationship
between topology and superconductivity, as well as stimulates further studies
of superconductivity in topological materials.

<h3>Theory of reactions between hydrogen and group-III acceptors in silicon</h3>

<br>
<br>
The thermodynamics of several reactions involving atomic and molecular
hydrogen with group-III acceptors is investigated. The results provide a
first-principles-level account of thermally- and carrier-activated processes
involving these species. Acceptor-hydrogen pairing is revisited as well. We
present a refined physicochemical picture of long-range migration, compensation
effects, and short-range reactions, leading to fully passivated
$\equiv\textrm{Si-H}\cdots X\equiv$ structures, where $X$ is a group-III
acceptor element. The formation and dissociation of acceptor-H and
acceptor-H$_{2}$ complexes is considered in the context of Light and elevated
Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID) of silicon-based solar cells. Besides
explaining observed trends and answering several fundamental questions
regarding the properties of acceptor-hydrogen pairing, we find that the
BH$_{2}$ complex is a by-product along the reaction of H$_{2}$ molecules with
boron toward the formation of BH pairs (along with subtraction of free holes).
The calculated changes in Helmholtz free energies upon the considered defect
reactions, as well as activation barriers for BH$_{2}$ formation/dissociation
(close to $\sim1$ eV) are compatible with the experimentally determined
activation energies of degradation/recovery rates of Si:B-based cells during
LeTID. Dihydrogenated acceptors heavier than boron are anticipated to be
effective-mass-like shallow donors, and therefore, unlikely to show similar
non-radiative recombination activity.

<h3>Spin Hall conductivity in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model at finite  temperature</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The Kane-Mele model is known to show a quantized spin Hall conductivity at
zero temperature. Including Hubbard interactions at each site leads to a
quantum phase transition to an XY antiferromagnet at sufficiently high
interaction strength. Here, we use the two-particle self-consistent approach
(TPSC), which we extend to include spin-orbit coupling, to investigate the
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model at finite temperature and half-filling. TPSC is a weak
to intermediate coupling approach capable of calculating a frequency- and
momentum-dependent self-energy from spin and charge fluctuations. We present
results for the spin Hall conductivity and correlation lengths for
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for different values of temperature,
spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction. The vertex corrections, which here
are analogues of Maki-Thompson contributions, show a strong momentum dependence
and give a large contribution in the vicinity of the phase transition at all
temperatures. Their inclusion is necessary to observe the quantization of the
spin Hall conductivity for the interacting system in the zero temperature
limit. At finite temperature, increasing the Hubbard interaction leads to a
decrease of the spin Hall conductivity. This decrease can be explained by
band-gap renormalization from scattering of electrons on antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations.

<h3>Premature jump-down mimicks nonlinear damping in nanoresonators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15656" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15656</a>
<br>
<i>Safvan Palathingal, Dominic Vella</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments on nano-resonators in a bistable regime use the
`jump-down' point between states to infer mechanical properties of the membrane
or a load, but often suggest the presence of some nonlinear damping. Motivated
by such experiments, we develop a mechanical model of a membrane subject to a
uniform, oscillatory load and linear damping. We solve this model numerically
and compare its jump-down behaviour with standard asymptotic predictions for a
one-dimensional Duffing oscillator with strain stiffening. We show that the
axisymmetric, but spatially-varying, problem can be mapped to the Duffing
problem with coefficients determined rationally from the model's Partial
Differential Equations. However, we also show that jump-down happens earlier
than expected (i.e.~at lower frequency, and with a smaller oscillation
amplitude). Although this premature jump-down is often interpreted as the
signature of a nonlinear damping in experiments, its appearance in numerical
simulations with only linear damping suggests instead that indicate that the
limitations of asymptotic results may, at least sometimes, be the cause. We
therefore suggest that care should be exercised in interpreting the results of
nano-resonator experiments.

<h3>Long-Range Hydrophobic Attraction Between Graphene and Water/Oil  Interfaces</h3>

Long-range hydrophobic attractions between mesoscopic surfaces in water play
an important role in many colloid and interface phenomena. Despite being
studied by several approaches, the origin of these forces has yet to be
adequately explained. While previous research has focused on solid/water/solid
and solid/water/air scenarios, we investigated a solid/water/liquid situation
to gain additional insight. We directly measured the long-range interactions
between a solid and a hydrophobic liquid separated by water using force
spectroscopy, where colloidal probes were coated with graphene oxide (GO) to
interact with immobilized heptane droplets in water. We detected attractions
with a range of ~0.5 {\mu}m that cannot be explained by standard
Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. When the GO was reduced to rGO
to become more hydrophobic, these forces increased in strength and ranged up to
1.2 {\mu}m. This suggests that the observed attractions result from long-range
hydrophobic forces. Based on our results, we propose air bubbles attached to
the colloidal probe and molecular rearrangement at the water/oil interface as
possible origins of the observed interactions. This knowledge will be useful to
understand and motivate the formation of emulsions using 2D materials and other
amphiphilic/hydrophobic particles.

<br>
<br>
We consider a one-dimensional driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensate
under incoherent pump, described by the stochastic generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. It was shown that the condensate phase dynamics maps under some
assumptions to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, and the temporal
coherence of the condensate follows a stretched exponential decay characterized
by KPZ universal exponents. In this work, we determine the main mechanisms
which lead to the departure from the KPZ phase, and identify three possible
other regimes: (i) a soliton-patterned regime at large interactions and weak
noise, populated by localized structures analogue to dark solitons; (ii) a
vortex-disordered regime at high noise and weak interactions, dominated by
point-like phase defects in space-time; (iii) a defect-free reservoir-textured
regime where the adiabatic approximation breaks down. We characterize each
regime by the space-time maps, the first-order correlations, the momentum
distribution and the density of topological defects. We thus obtain the phase
diagram at varying noise, pump intensity and interaction strength. Our
predictions are amenable to observation in state-of-art experiments with
exciton-polaritons.

<h3>Crossover from Non-Fermi-Liquid to Pseudogap Behavior in the Spectral of  Local Impurity in Power-Law Diverging Multichannel Kondo Model</h3>

<br>
Motivated by the emergence of higher-order van Hove singularities (VHS) with
power-law divergent density of states (DOS)
($\rho_c(\omega)=\rho_0/|\omega|^{r}$, $0<r<1$) in materials, we investigate a
multichannel Kondo model involving conduction electrons near the higher-order
van Hove filling. This model considers $M$ channel and $N$ spin degrees of
freedom. Employing a renormalization group analysis and dynamical large-$N$
approach, our results reveal a crossover from a non-Fermi liquid to pseudogap
behavior in the spectral properties of the local impurity at the overscreened
fixed point. At this critical fixed point, we precisely determine the
conditions under which the crossover occurs, either by tuning the exponent $r$
or the ratio $\kappa=M/N$ to a critical value. The results of this study
provide novel insights into the non-Fermi liquid and pseudogap behaviors
observed in strongly correlated systems, shedding light on the intriguing
interplay between higher-order van Hove singularities and multichannel Kondo
physics.

<br>

We investigate the classical ground state of a large number of charges
confined inside a disk and interacting via the Coulomb potential. By realizing
the important role that the peripheral charges play in determining the lowest
energy solutions, we have successfully implemented an algorithm that allows us
to work with configurations with a desired number of border charges. This
feature brings a consistent reduction in the computational complexity of the
problem, thus simplifying the search of global minima of the energy.
Additionally, we have implemented a divide and conquer approach which has
allowed us to study configurations of size never reached before (the largest
one corresponding to $N=40886$ charges). These last configurations, in
particular, are seen to display an increasingly rich structure of topological
defects as $N$ gets larger.

We study the structural phase transition associated with the highest
superconducting critical temperature measured in high-pressure sulfur hydride.
A quantitative description of its pressure dependence has been elusive for any
\emph{ab initio} theory attempted so far, raising questions on the actual
mechanism driving the transition. Here, we reproduce the critical pressure of
the hydrogen bond symmetrization in the Im$\bar{3}$m structure, in agreement
with experimental data, by combining quantum Monte Carlo simulations for
electrons with path integral molecular dynamics for quantum nuclei. For
comparison, we also apply the self-consistent harmonic approximation, which
underestimates the critical pressure by about 40 GPa even when the most
accurate potential energy surface is used, pinpointing the importance of an
exact treatment of nuclear quantum effects. They indeed play a major role in a
significant reduction ($\approx$ 100 GPa) of the classical transition pressure
and in a large isotope shift ($\approx$ 25 GPa) upon hydrogen-to-deuterium
substitution.

The topological characteristics of photonic crystals have been the subject of
intense research in recent years. Despite this, the basic question of whether
photonic band topology is rare or abundant -- i.e., its relative prevalence --
remains unaddressed. Here, we determine the prevalence of stable, fragile, and
higher-order photonic topology in the 11 two-dimensional crystallographic
symmetry settings that admit diagnosis of one or more of these phenomena by
symmetry analysis. Our determination is performed on the basis of a data set of
550000 randomly sampled, two-tone photonic crystals, spanning 11 symmetry
settings and 5 dielectric contrasts, and examined in both transverse electric
(TE) and magnetic (TM) polarizations. We report the abundance of nontrivial
photonic topology in the presence of time-reversal symmetry and find that
stable, fragile, and higher-order topology are generally abundant. Below the
first band gap, which is of primary experimental interest, we find that stable
topology is more prevalent in the TE polarization than the TM; is only weakly,
but monotonically, dependent on dielectric contrast; and that fragile topology
is near-absent. In the absence of time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial Chern
phases are also abundant in photonic crystals with 2-, 4-, and 6-fold
rotational symmetries but comparatively rare in settings with only 3-fold
symmetry. Our results elucidate the interplay of symmetry, dielectric contrast,
electromagnetic polarization, and time-reversal breaking in engendering
topological photonic phases and may inform general design principles for their
experimental realization.

<h3>Type II t-J model and shared antiferromagnetic spin coupling from Hund's  rule in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>

Recently a 80 K superconductor was observed in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high
pressure. Density function theory (DFT) calculations identify $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{z^2}$ as two active orbitals and a bilayer square lattice structure. The
averange valence of Ni is $d^{8-x}$ with $x=0.5$ per site. Naively one may
expect a description in terms of a two-orbital t-J model. However, there should
be significant inter-orbital repulsion $U'$ and Hund's coupling $J_H$ larger
than the bare value of $t$ and $J$. Especially the Hund's coupling can share
the inter-layer super-exchange $J_\perp$ of $d_{z^2}$ to $d_{x^2-y^2}$, an
effect beyond any perturbative and mean field treatment. In the limit that
$d_{z^2}$ is Mott localized, we integrate it out and deal with a bialyer t-J
model for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ only. We find strong inter-layer pairing due to the
transmitted $J_\perp$ which can survive to $50\%$ hole doping relevant to the
experiment. In real system we expect that $d_{z^2}$ orbital will also be
slightly hole doped and can not be simply ignored. To deal with this situation,
we take the $J_H\rightarrow +\infty$ limit and propose a type II t-J model with
four singlon ($d^7$) states and three spin-triplet doublon ($d^8$) states.
Through a parton mean field treatment of the constrained Hilbert space, we
derive the bilayer one-orbital t-J model for an emergent `$d_{x^2-y^2}$'
orbital with significant $J_\perp$, justifying our phenomenological treatment.
The type II t-J model can also describe the regime where the $d_{z^2}$ orbital
is also slightly hole doped through tuning an orbital energy splitting
$\Delta$. From our calculation the pairing strength decreases with the hole
doping $x$ and $x=0.5$ is likely larger than the optimal doping. We propose
future experiments to electron dope the system to further enhance $T_c$.

Topological defects in active polar fluids can organise spontaneous flows and
influence macroscopic density patterns. Both of them play, for example, an
important role during animal development. Yet the influence of density on
active flows is poorly understood. Motivated by experiments on cell monolayers
confined to discs, we study the coupling between density and polar order for a
compressible active polar fluid in presence of a +1 topological defect. As in
the experiments, we find a density-controlled spiral-to-aster transition. In
addition, biphasic orientational phases emerge as a generic outcome of such
coupling. Our results highlight the importance of density gradients as a
potential mechanism for controlling flow and orientational patterns in
biological systems.
