<p>The thermal resistance of a spin-polarized hydrodynamic Dirac plasma in
graphene is considered. A mechanism for the coupling of heat and spin flows is
discussed, demonstrating that spin diffusion and spin thermocurrent modify
viscous dissipation, leading to a significant enhancement of thermal
resistance. Practical calculations are then presented for graphene devices in

<h3>A systematic framework to construct unconventional superconducting  pairing scar states using multi-body interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02914</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shohei Imai, Naoto Tsuji</i>
<p>We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have
unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by
incorporating multi-body interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two
particles). The multi-body interactions are introduced in a form of the local
density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real
space has the same interaction energy by cancelling the two-body and multi-body
interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in
any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an
exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other
unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). We
verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with
the multi-body interactions has the $d$-wave pairing state as an energy
eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as
evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, the
entanglement entropy, and the level statistics. We also discuss other examples,
including $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice, $s$-wave pairing
states in a nearest-neighbor interacting system, and spinless $p$-wave pairing
states in one dimension.

<h3>A review: The Gor'kov-Teitel'baum thermal activation model for cuprates</h3>

</p><i>Navinder Singh</i>
<p>While closing their famous paper entitled "Pseudogap: friend or foe of
high-Tc?" Norman, Pines, and Kallin underlined that before we have a
microscopic theory, we must have a consistent phenomenology. This was in 2005.
As it turns out in 2006 a phenomenological theory of the pseudogap state was
proposed by Gor'kov and Teitel'baum. This originated from their careful
analysis of the Hall effect data, and it has been very successful model as
numerous investigations over the years has shown. In this mini-review the
essence of the idea of Gor'kov and Teitel'baum is presented. The pseudogap
obtained by them from the Hall effect data agrees very well with that obtained
from the ARPES data. This famous Gor'kov-Teitel'baum Thermal Activation model
(in short GTTA model) not only presents a consistent phenomenology of the
pseudogap state but also it rationalizes the Hall angle data and it presents a
strong case against the famous "two-relaxation times" idea of Anderson and
collaborators.

<h3>Comment on "Towards exact solutions for the superconducting $T_c$  induced by electron-phonon interaction"</h3>

</p><i>Grgur Palle</i>
<p>In a series of recent articles, Liu, Yang, Pan, et al. claim to have
determined the exact dressed electron-boson vertex for a number of very general
interacting many-body problems by inverting certain Ward-Takahashi identities.
Here, we point out that their Ward-Takahashi identities are missing terms which
make the inversion of the identities impossible. One therefore cannot formulate
exact self-contained integral equations for the dressed electron propagator. In
addition, the proposed vertex expressions do not reproduce well-established
results for the leading perturbative corrections.

<h3>Probing the band splitting near the Γ point in the van der Waals  magnetic semiconductor CrSBr</h3>

<p>This study investigates the electronic band structure of Chromium Sulfur
Bromide (CrSBr) through comprehensive photoluminescence (PL) characterization.
We clearly identify low-temperature optical transitions between two closely
adjacent conduction-band states and two different valence-band states. The
analysis of the PL data robustly unveils energy splittings, bandgaps and
excitonic transitions across different thicknesses of CrSBr, ranging from
monolayer to bulk. Temperature-dependent PL measurements elucidate the
stability of the band splitting below the N\'eel temperature, suggesting that
magnons coupled with excitons are responsible for the symmetry breaking and
brightening of the transitions from the secondary conduction band minimum
(CBM2) to the global valence band maximum (VBM1). Collectively, these results
not only reveal band splitting in both the conduction and valence bands, but
also point to an intricate interplay between the optical, electronic and
magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic two-dimensional van der Waals
crystals.

<p>Chiral crystals and molecules were recently predicted to form an intriguing
platform for unconventional orbital physics. Here, we report the observation of
chirality-driven orbital textures in the bulk electronic structure of CoSi, a
prototype member of the cubic B20 family of chiral crystals. Using circular
dichroism in soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission, we demonstrate the
formation of a bulk orbital-angular-momentum texture and monopole-like
orbital-momentum locking that depends on crystal handedness. We introduce the
intrinsic chiral circular dichroism, icCD, as a differential photoemission
observable and a natural probe of chiral electron states. Our findings render
chiral crystals promising for spin-orbitronics applications.

<h3>Unraveling the Mn $L_3$-edge RIXS spectrum of lightly manganese doped  Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$</h3>

<p>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiment was performed at the Mn
$L_3$ edge. A 10 $\%$ Mn-doped Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ compound, where the
Mn$^{3+}$ ions are in the 3$d^4$ state, were probed for $dd$ excitations. The
dilute doping concentration allows one to treat the dopant Mn$^{3+}$ ions as
effectively free in the host ruthenium compound. The local nature of $dd$ RIXS
spectroscopy permits one to use a single-site model to simulate the
experimental spectra. The simulated spectra reproduces the in-plane [100]
experimental RIXS spectrum. We also predict the intensity for the in-plane
[110] direction and the out-of-plane spin orientation configuration [001].
Based on our single-ion model we were able to fit the experimental data to
obtain the crystal field parameters, the 10Dq value, and the intra-orbital
spin-flip energy 2$\mathcal{J}$(or $3J_{H}$, where $J_{H}$ is the Hund's
energy) of the Mn$^{3+}$ ion. Utilizing our computed RIXS quantum transition
amplitudes between the various $d$ orbitals of the Mn$^{3+}$ ion, the
expression for the Kramers-Heisenberg cross section, and a self-consistent
fitting procedure we also identify the energy boundaries of the non-spin-flip
and spin-flip $dd$ excitations present in the experimental data. From our
fitting procedure we obtain $2\mathcal{J} (3J_{H})=2.06$ eV, a value which is
in excellent agreement with that computed from the free ion Racah parameters.
We also identified the charge transfer boundary. In addition to predicting the
microscopic parameters, we find a quantum spin-flip transition in the non-cross
($\sigma_{in}-\sigma_{out}$, $\pi_{in}-\pi_{out}$) x-ray polarization channels
of the $dd$ RIXS spectra. A similar transition, was previously predicted to
occur in the $\pi-\pi$ channel of the magnon spectrum in the non-collinear
non-coplanar Kagome compound composed of Cu$^{2+}$ 3d$^{9}$ ion.

<h3>Topological Data Analysis for Particulate Gels</h3>

</p><i>Alexander Smith, Gavin J. Donley, Emanuela Del Gado, Victor M. Zavala</i>
<p>Soft gels, formed via the self-assembly of particulate organic materials,
exhibit intricate multi-scale structures that provides them with flexibility
and resilience when subjected to external stresses. This work combines
molecular simulations and topological data analysis (TDA) to characterize the
complex multi-scale structure of soft gels. Our TDA analysis focuses on the use
of the Euler characteristic, which is an interpretable and
computationally-scalable topological descriptor that is combined with
filtration operations to obtain information on the geometric (local) and
topological (global) structure of soft gels. We reduce the topological
information obtained with TDA using principal component analysis (PCA) and show
that this provides an informative low-dimensional representation of gel
structure. We use the proposed computational framework to investigate the
influence of gel preparation (e.g., quench rate, volume fraction) on soft gel
structure and to explore dynamic deformations that emerge under oscillatory
shear in various response regimes (linear, nonlinear, and flow). Our analysis
identifies specific scales and extents at which hierarchical structures in soft
gels are affected; moreover, correlations between structural deformations and
mechanical phenomena (such as shear stiffening) are explored. In summary, we
show that TDA facilitates the mathematical representation, quantification, and
analysis of soft gel structures, extending traditional network analysis methods
to capture both local and global organization.

<h3>Incorporating non-linear effects in fast semi-analytical thermal  modelling of powder bed fusion</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03018</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shaun R. Cooke, Chadwick W. Sinclair, Daan M. Maijer</i>
<p>The usefulness of semi-analytical thermal models for predicting the
connection between process, microstructure and properties in powder bed fusion
has been well illustrated in recent years. Such an approach provides the
promise of accuracy comparable to tools that are orders of magnitude more
computationally expensive. The opportunity to make predictions that span
several orders of magnitude in space and time comes at the cost of significant
simplifications, limiting fully quantitative predictions without empirical
calibration. This approach relies on solving a linear problem meaning that
first order non-linear effects induced by e.g. the temperature dependence of
material properties and surface boundary conditions, are not incorporated.
Here, we revisit these limitations and highlight ways that temperature varying
material properties and radiative heat loss from the melt pool can be
systematically accounted for. These corrections, made with an eye to minimizing
additional computational overhead, bring the technique's predictive capability
much closer to that of high fidelity thermal simulations. Quantitative
comparisons to experiments are used to illustrate the important impact of
including such corrections.

<p>Recent experiments have pointed to the formation of a new state of matter,
the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ . The state
spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two
critical points, separating it from the superconducting and normal metal
states. The adjacent two critical points make acoustic effects a promising tool
to study such states because of their sensitivity to symmetry-breaking
transitions. We report a theory of the acoustic effects of systems with an
electron quadrupling phase and new ultrasound velocity measurements of
Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. The presented theory for the
electron quadrupling state gives the same type of singularities that are
observed in experiment.

<p>Magnetic topological materials with coexisting magnetism and non-trivial band
structures exhibit many novel quantum phenomena, including the quantum
anomalous Hall effect, the axion insulator state, and the Weyl semimetal phase.
As a stoichiometric layered antiferromagnetic topological insulator, thin films
of MnBi2Te4 show fascinating even-odd layer-dependent physics. In this work, we
fabricate a series of thin-flake MnBi2Te4 devices using stencil masks and
observe the Chern insulator state at high magnetic fields and a square
hysteresis loop near zero magnetic field in all these devices. Upon magnetic
field training, a large exchange bias effect is observed in odd but not in even
septuple layer (SL) devices. Our theoretical calculations interpret this
even-odd layer-dependent exchange bias effect as a consequence of contrasting
surface and bulk magnetic properties of MnBi2Te4 devices. Our findings reveal
the microscopic magnetic configuration of MnBi2Te4 thin flakes and highlight
the challenges in replicating the zero magnetic field quantum anomalous Hall
effect in odd SL MnBi2Te4 devices.

<h3>Enhancing Phase Stability and Coercivity of MnAl $τ$-L$1_0$ with Fe  and Ni Substitutions: \textit{ab initio} and Micromagnetic Modeling</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Churna Bhandari, Gavin N. Nope, Durga Paudyal</i>
<p>The binary manganese aluminium (MnAl) alloy with L$1_0$ crystal structure,
which exhibits exceptional magnetic properties, is a promising rare earth
element free permanent magnet material. However, according to experimental
reports, synthesizing it in a stable bulk form is extremely challenging. Here,
we propose and theoretically verify an alternative method of stabilizing the
material by partially substituting Mn and Al sites by Fe and Ni and identify
its stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties from density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. When considering a fixed ($50\%$)-Ni, the
magnetic anisotropy increases with the increasing Fe content, but the trend is
opposite in terms of formation energy. The calculated formation energies
demonstrate that all the binary and quaternary compositions are stable. Through
the analysis of calculated elastic constants and phonon frequencies, we confirm
that all compositions are mechanically and dynamically stable. Most
importantly, both magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropy constant in $50\%$-Fe
substituted composition (equiatomic phase) increases significantly as compared
to the MnAl. Predicted coercivity of equiatomic phase is larger than parent
compound obtained by combining DFT computed parameters with micromagnetic
simulations.

<p>We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with
nonlinear dynamics universally lead to a genuine realization of the
bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and
conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic
toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an
emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT
data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal
CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete
example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure
the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.

<h3>Computational Study Based Prediction of New Photocatalysts for water  splitting by systematic manipulation of MXene surfaces</h3>

</p><i>Swati Shaw, Subhradip Ghosh</i>
<p>The compositional and structural flexibility of functionalised
two-dimensional metal carbonitrides or MXenes has been exploited through a
combinatorial search for new materials that can act as catalysts for
photo-assisted water splitting by absorbing sunlight with energy in the
infra-red region. Detailed calculations on 49 Janus MXenes where two surfaces
are of asymmetric nature are carried out by first-principles Density Functional
Theory. A screening procedure is adopted to arrive at potential candidates. Our
calculations predict four new materials whose surfaces can activate both
hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions upon splitting water, two out of which
are infra-red active, and the rest are visible light-active. We have performed
a detailed microscopic analysis to find out the interrelations of the
structural model of surface functionalisation, the chemistry of the surfaces,
the electronic structure, and the alignment of bands with respect to the
reaction potentials that explain our results. Apart from these four compounds,
we find thirteen other compounds that are suitable for either hydrogen
evolution or oxygen reduction reactions. This study lays out a guideline for
the systematic discovery of potential new catalysts for water splitting under
sunlight irradiation.

<p>Exploring new strategies for controlling the magnetic domain propagation is
the key to realize ultrafast, high-density domain wall-based memory and logic
devices for next generation computing. These strategies include strain
modulation in multiferroic devices, geometric confinement and area-selective
pinning of domain wall. 2D Van der Waals materials introduce localized
modifications to the interfacial magnetic order, enabling control over the
propagation of magnetic domains. Here, using Lorentz-Transmission Electron
Microscopy (L-TEM) along with the Modified Transport of Intensity equations
(MTIE), we demonstrate controlled domain expansion with in-situ magnetic field
in a ferromagnet (Permalloy, NiFe) interfacing with a 2D Van der Waals material
Graphene (Gr). The Gr/NiFe interface exhibits distinctive domain expansion rate
with magnetic field selectively near the interface which is further analyzed
using micromagnetic simulations. Our findings are crucial for comprehending
direct visualization of interface controlled magnetic domain expansion,
offering insights for developing future domain wall-based technology.

<h3>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in a ferromagnetic  superfluid: effects of axial magnetization</h3>

<p>An easy-plane ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas undergoes two
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, associated with mass and
spin superfluidity respectively. We study the effect of axial magnetization on
the superfluid properties of this system. We find that nonzero axial
magnetization couples mass and spin superflow, via a mechanism analogous to the
Andreev-Bashkin effect present in two-component superfluids. With sufficiently
large axial magnetization mass and spin superfluidity arise simultaneously. The
cross-over to this phase provides a finite-temperature generalization of the
zero-temperature broken-axisymmetric to easy-axis transition. We present
analytic relations connecting mass and spin superfluidity with experimentally
observable coherence of the three spinor components and local magnetization.

<h3>$\frac{5}{2}$ fractional quantum Hall state in GaAs with Landau level  mixing</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Wenchen Luo, Muaath Abdulwahab, Xiang Liu, Hao Wang</i>
<p>The Landau level mixing is the key in understanding the mysterious 5/2
fractional quantum Hall effect in GaAs quantum well. Theoretical calculations
with and without Landau level mixing show striking differences. However, the
way to deal with the considerable strong Landau level mixing in GaAs is still
unsatisfactory. We develop a method combining the screening and the
perturbation theories to study the nature of the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall
effect in GaAs efficiently. The screening which has been succeed in explaining
ZnO systems integrates out the low-energy Landau levels close to the related
Landau level, while the other high-energy Landau levels are integrated out by
the perturbation theory. We find that the ground states still hold the
quasi-triplet degeneracy which implies the Pfaffian nature of the system.
Furthermore, the particle-hole symmetry is only weakly violated since the
particle-hole parity is close to unity. We propose that the ground state can be
described by the two-component trial state cluster constructed by the
superposition of the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states with varied weights
depending on the external conditions. In the experimental environment the two
weights are close, corresponding that its thermal conductance slightly biased
from 2.5 quanta can be understood straightforwardly.

<h3>Giant and controllable nonlinear magneto-optical effects in  two-dimensional magnets</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Dezhao Wu, Meng Ye, Haowei Chen, Yong Xu, Wenhui Duan</i>
<p>The interplay of polarization and magnetism in materials with light can
create rich nonlinear magneto-optical (NLMO) effects, and the recent discovery
of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets provides remarkable control over
NLMO effects due to their superb tunability. Here, based on first-principles
calculations, we reported giant NLMO effects in CrI3-based 2D magnets,
including a dramatic change of second-harmonics generation (SHG) polarization
direction (90 degrees) and intensity (on/off switch) under magnetization
reversal, and a 100% SHG circular dichroism effect. We further revealed that
these effects could not only be used to design ultra-thin multifunctional
optical devices, but also to detect subtle magnetic orderings. Remarkably, we
analytically derived conditions to achieve giant NLMO effects and propose
general strategies to realize them in 2D magnets. Our work not only uncovers a
series of intriguing NLMO phenomena, but also paves the way for both
fundamental research and device applications of ultra-thin NLMO materials.

<p>We investigated the magnetic and electric properties of nanometer-sized
vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) particles. VO$_2$ nanoparticles were formed by
milling VO$_2$ powder. We measured the magnetic field dependence of the
magnetization of the VO$_2$ powder and nanoparticles. The VO$_2$ powder did not
exhibit ferromagnetism, whereas the VO$_2$ nanoparticles exhibited
ferromagnetism. In addition, we fabricated samples by bridging between
electrodes with the VO$_2$ nanoparticles, and the temperature dependence of
their resistance was measured. Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) were
observed, and the temperature range where the MIT occurred was wider than that
in a typical bulk VO$_2$. The VO$_2$ nanoparticles exhibited these properties
of ferromagnetism and MIT possibly because of the surface and size effects of
the VO$_2$ nanoparticles. These results indicate the first observation of the
competitive coexistence of ferromagnetism and MIT of VO$_2$ nanoparticles.

<br>
</p><i>Jin-Xin Li, Xue-Jing Feng, Ying-Ying Zhang, Jing-Xue Liu, Lu Qin, Zun-Lue Zhu, Xing-Dong Zhao, Liang-Liang Wang</i>
<p>We systematically investigate unconventional superfluid phases of fermionic
dipolar particles lying in a double-wire setup with laser-assisted interwire
tunneling. Our numerical simulations, based on the nonlocal Kohn-Sham
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, reveal the existence of a large
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) region with a stripe phase under an
imbalance of particle densities between two wires. When the laser-assisted
interwire tunneling is present, it induces a transition from the FFLO phase to
the topological superfluid phase and the associated Majorana zero modes exhibit
an oscillation structure, which is significantly enhanced by the long-range
nature of the interwire dipolar interaction. This distinguishes itself from the
results obtained with usual contact interaction and offers new opportunities
for manipulating and reshaping Majorana zero modes by adjusting the degree of
the nonlocality and the interwire separation.

<h3>Geometry-induced friction at a soft interface</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03255</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aashna Chawla, Deepak Kumar</i>
<p>Soft and biological matter come in a variety of shapes and geometries. When
soft surfaces that do not fit into each other due to a mismatch in Gaussian
curvatures form an interface, beautiful geometry-induced patterns emerge. In
this paper, we study the effect of geometry on the dynamical response of soft
surfaces moving relative to each other. Using a novel experimental scheme, we
measure friction between a highly bendable thin polymer sheet and a hydrogel
substrate. At this soft and low-friction interface, we find a strong dependence
of friction on the relative geometry of the two surfaces - a flat sheet
experiences significantly larger friction on a spherical substrate than on
planar or cylindrical substrate. We show that the stress developed in the sheet
due to its geometrically incompatible confinement is responsible for the
enhanced friction. This mechanism also leads to a transition in the nature of
friction as the sheet radius is increased beyond a critical value. Our finding
reveals a hitherto unnoticed non-specific mechanism of purely geometrical
origin that may influence friction significantly in soft, biological, and
nano-scale systems. In particular, it provokes us to re-examine our
understanding of phenomena such as the curvature dependence of biological cell
mobility.

<p>We study the effect of the magnon-magnon interaction on the nonlinear magnon
transport. The magnon-magnon interaction induces nonreciprocal magnon decay
when the time-reversal symmetry is broken, and leads to nonlinear thermal
responses of magnons. We construct a theoretical framework to study the
nonlinear thermal responses due to the nonreciprocal magnon decay by using the
imaginary Dyson equation and quantum kinetic theory, which is then applied to a
model of honeycomb ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. An
order estimate shows that the nonlinear thermal response from the present
mechanism is feasible for experimental measurement.

<h3>Adsorption of Gases on Ti3C2Tx MXene: Implications from X-ray  Photoelectron Spectroscopy</h3>

<p>One of the most explored MXenes is the Ti3C2Tx, where Tx is designated to
inherently formed termination species. Among many applications, Ti3C2Tx is an
excellent material for energy storage, energy converting, and CO2-capturing
devices. However, active sites for adsorption and surface reactions on the
Ti3C2Tx-surface are still open questions to explore, which have implications
for preparation methods when to obtain correct and optimized surface
requirements. Here we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to study adsorption
of common gas molecules such as H2, CO2, and H2O, which all might be present in
energy storage, energy converting, and CO2-capturing devices based on 2D flakes
of Ti3C2Tx. The study shows that H2O, with a strong bonding to the Ti-Ti
bridge-sites, can be considered as a termination species. An H2O terminated
Ti3C2Tx-surface restricts the CO2 adsorption to the Ti on-top sites and reduces
the ability to store positive ions, such as Li+ and Na+. On the other hand, an
H2O terminated Ti3C2Tx-surface shows the capability to split water. The study
further shows that H2 has the ability to remove F at moderate temperatures. The
results from this study have implications for correct selection of MXene
preparations and the environment around the MXene in different implementations.

<br>
</p><i>Igor N. Karnaukhov</i>
<p>The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is studied in the semiclassical
limit in the framework of the Hofstadter model with a short-range interaction
between fermions. In the mean-field approximation, the repulsion between
fermions leads to a periodic potential. Numerical calculations show that in the
case of the periodic potential with a period that is a multiple on
$\frac{1}{\nu}$ of the magnetic cell ($\nu$ is filling of a separated band)
composite Hofstadter bands (HBs) are formed. The composite HBs are split into
$\frac{1}{\nu}$ subbands, which are separated by the Dirac points. The Chern
number of $\gamma$-full filled composite HBs is equal to the Chern number
$C_{\gamma}$ of the corresponding HB. The Chern number, equal to $\nu
C_{\gamma}$, corresponds to $\nu$-filling of $\gamma$-composite HB. Thus, FQHE
is realized by fractional filling of composite HBs.

<p>Manipulating point defects for tailored macroscopic properties remains a
formidable challenge in materials science. This study demonstrates a
proof-of-principle for a universal law involving element Mn, significantly
enhancing vacancy diffusion through an unprecedented anomalous Friedel
Oscillations phenomenon, across most metals in the periodic table. The
correlation between Mn-induced point-defect dynamic changes and intrinsic
macro-properties is robustly validated through the first-principles theory and
well-designed experiments. The physical origin stems from Mn's exceptionally
large effective intra-elemental 3d electron interactions, surpassing the
Coulomb attraction induced by vacancy and disrupting the electron screening
effect. Given the ubiquitous nature of vacancies and their recognition as the
most crucial defects influencing nearly all physical and mechanical properties
of crystalline materials, this outcome may drive advances in a broad domain.

<h3>Electronic structure of noncentrosymmetric B20 compound HfSn and tuning  of multifold band-crossing points</h3>

<p>We present a detailed theoretical study of the electronic structure of
hafnium tin HfSn crystallizing in a B$20$ structure, renowned for the diversity
of physical and peculiar topological properties. The chiral crystal structure
of these materials protects multifold band crossings located at high symmetry
points. We employ density functional methods to reveal basic features of the
band structure and Fermi surface topology of HfSn, on top of which an effective
tight-binding model is built. The compound exhibits a fourfold band crossing
pinned at the ${\Gamma}$ point. We investigate routes that can shift such
crossings towards the Fermi level, offering a unique way to possibly tune the
compound`s properties. Specifically, we show that the energy position of the
fourfold crossing can be easily manipulated via external perturbations such as
strain and pressure. Considering that this point carries a topological charge
larger than one, such tuning is of great importance. We anticipate that the
approach presented in the current study can be utilized to investigate symmetry
protected crossings in a wide class of materials.

<h3>Material design optimization for large-m 11B4C-based Ni/Ti supermirror  neutron optics</h3>

<p>State-of-the-art Ni/Ti supermirror neutron optics have limited reflected
intensity and a restricted neutron energy range due to the interface width.
Incorporating low-neutron-absorbing 11B4C enhances reflectivity and allows for
thinner layers to be deposited, with which more efficient supermirrors with
higher m-values can be realized. However, incorporating 11B4C reduces the
optical contrast, limiting the attainable reflectivity at low scattering
vectors, making this approach infeasible. This study explores various
approaches to optimize the material design of 11B4C-containing Ni/Ti
supermirrors to maintain high reflectivity at low scattering vectors and
achieve low interface widths at large scattering vectors. The scattering length
density contrast versus interface width is investigated for multilayer periods
of 30 {\AA}, 48 {\AA}, and 84 {\AA}, for designs involving pure Ni/Ti
multilayers, multilayers with 11B4C co-deposited in Ni and Ti layers,
multilayers with 11B4C co-deposited only in Ni layers, and multilayers with
11B4C as thin interlayers between Ni and Ti layers. Our results suggest that a
depth-graded hybrid material design by incorporating 11B4C inside the Ni and Ti
layers, below approximately 26 {\AA}, and introducing 1.5 {\AA} 11B4C
interlayers between the thicker Ni and Ti layers can achieve a higher
reflectivity than state-of-the-art Ni/Ti multilayers over the entire scattering
vector range.

<p>Trigonal Cr5Te8, a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet with an out of
plane magnetic anisotropy, has long been known to crystallise in a
centrosymmetric structure. Through detailed structural analysis together with
second harmonic generation experiments, we show that the compound actually
adopts a non-centrosymmetric structure. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of
102 {\Omega}^(-1) cm^(-1) at low temperature stems from intrinsic origin, which
is larger than any previously reported values in bulk Cr-Te system. In
addition, we observe a hump-like feature in the field-dependent Hall
resistivity data, resembling a typical topological Hall signal. We demonstrate
that the feature is highly tunable and is not related to topological Hall
effect even though we observe N\'eel-type skyrmions by Lorentz transmission
electron microscopy which is consistent with the non-centrosymmetric structure
of the compound.

<h3>Electronic ferroelectricity in monolayer graphene for multifunctional  neuromorphic electronics</h3>

<p>Ferroelectricity is intriguing for its spontaneous electric polarization,
which is switchable by an external electric field. Expanding ferroelectric
materials to two-dimensional limit will provide versatile applications for the
development of next-generation nonvolatile devices. Conventional
ferroelectricity requires the materials consisting of at least two constituent
elements associated with polar crystalline structures. Monolayer graphene as an
elementary two-dimensional material unlikely exhibits ferroelectric order due
to its highly centrosymmetric hexagonal lattices. Nevertheless, two-dimensional
moire superlattices offer a powerful way to engineer diverse electronic orders
in non-polar materials. Here, we report the observations of electronic
ferroelectricity in monolayer graphene by introducing asymmetric moire
superlattice at the graphene/h-BN interface. Utilizing Hall measurements, the
electric polarization is identified to stem from electron-hole dipoles,
suggesting the electronic dynamics of the observed ferroelectricity. Standard
polarization-electric field hysteresis loops, as well as unconventional
multiple switchable polarization states, have been achieved. By in-situ
comparing with control devices, we found that the electronic ferroelectricity
in graphene moire systems is independent of layer number of graphene and the
corresponding fine band structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
applications of this ferroelectric moire structures in multi-state non-volatile
data storage and the emulation of versatile synaptic behaviors, including
short-term plasticity, long-term potentiation and long-term depression. This
work not only enriches the fundamental understanding of ferroelectricity, but
also demonstrates the promising applications of graphene in multi-state
memories and neuromorphic computing.

<h3>Towards tailored magnetic anisotropy: A first-principles study of L1$_0$  FeNi ultrathin films</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03416" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03416</a>

</p><i>Joanna Marciniak, Mirosław Werwiński</i>
<p>In previous experiments, thin films of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi with different
surfaces, including (001), (110) and (111), were produced and studied. Each
surface defines a different alignment of the crystallographic tetragonal axis
with respect to the film's plane, resulting in different magnetic anisotropies.
In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to examine three
series of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with surfaces (001), (010), and (111), and
with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm (from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers). Our
results show that films (001) have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, while
(010) favor in-plane magnetization, with a clear preference for the tetragonal
axis [001]. We propose calling this type of in-plane anisotropy fixed in plane.
A film with surface (111) and a thickness of four atomic monolayers has the
magnetization easy axis almost perpendicular to the plane of the film. As the
thickness of the (111) film increases, the direction of magnetization rotates
towards a tetragonal axis [001], positioned at an angle of about 45$^{o}$ to
the plane of the film. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of ultrathin films
increases by a maximum of 5%, and the most significant changes in spin and
orbital magnetic moments occur at a depth of about three near-surface atomic
monolayers. The presented results could be useful for experimental efforts to
synthesize ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with different surfaces.
Ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with varying magnetic anisotropies may
find applications in spintronic devices.

<p>The superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides 2H-NbSe$_2$ and
2H-NbS$_2$ are intensively studied on account of their unique electronic
properties such as Ising superconductivity, found in multi- and monolayers,
with upper critical fields beyond the Pauli limit. Even in bulk crystals, there
are reports of multiband superconductivity and exotic states, such as the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. In this work, we investigate the
superconducting properties of 2H-NbS$_2$ through a detailed high-field mapping
of the phase diagram by means of magnetotransport and magnetostriction
experiments. We compare the phase diagram between bulk crystals and a 6~nm
thick flake of 2H-NbS$_2$ and find a drastically enhanced Maki parameter in the
flake, signifying a change of the relevant pair breaking mechanism from orbital
to paramagnetic pair breaking, which we attribute to an effect of enhanced
spin-orbit coupling.

negligible Peierls barrier. We report the first direct numeric evidence of
quantum shape fluctuations -- caused by superclimbing modes -- in simple

$^4$He adsorbed on graphite. Our data unambiguously reveals the defining

implication, i.e., that superfluid stiffness can be inferred from density
snapshots.

</p><i>Joel Diaz Maier, Katharina Gaus, Joachim Wagner</i>
<p>We exemplarily investigate how optical properties of single scatterers in
interacting multi-particle systems influence measurable structure factors. Both
particles with linear gradients of their scattering length density and
core-shell structures evoke characteristic deviations between the weighted sum
$\langle S(Q)\rangle$ of partial structure factors in a multicomponent system
and experimentally accessible, measurable structure factors
$S_{\mathrm{M}}(Q)$. While $\langle S(Q)\rangle$ contains only structural
information of self-organising systems, $S_{\mathrm{M}}(Q)$ additionally is
influenced by optical properties of their constituents resulting in features
such as changing amplitudes, additional peaks in the low wavevector region or
splitting of higher-order maxima which are not related to structural reasons.
Hence, a careful data analysis regarding size-distribution and optical
properties of single scatters is mandatory to avoid a misinterpretation of
measurable structure factors.

</p><i>Ohad Vilk, Michael Assaf</i>
<p>We study the long-time dynamics in non-Markovian single-population stochastic
models, where one or more reactions are modelled as a stochastic process with a
fat-tailed non-exponential distribution of waiting times, mimicking long-term
memory. We focus on three prototypical examples: genetic switching, population
establishment and population extinction, all with non-exponential production
rates. The system is studied in two regimes. In the first, the distribution of
waiting times has a finite mean. Here, the system approaches a
(quasi)stationary steady state at long times, and we develop a general WKB
approach for these non-Markovian systems. We derive explicit results for the
mean population size and mean escape time from the metastable state of the
stochastic dynamics. In this realm, we reveal that for sufficiently strong
memory, a memory-induced (meta)stable state can emerge in the system. In the
second regime, the waiting time distribution is assumed to have an infinite
mean. Here, for bistable systems we find two distinct scaling regimes,
separated by an exponentially long time which may strongly depend on the
initial conditions of the system.

<h3>Coupled harmonics due to time-modulated point scatterers</h3>

</p><i>Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, Bryn Davies</i>
<p>We consider the resonance and scattering properties of a composite medium
containing scatterers whose properties are modulated in time. When excited with
an incident wave of a single frequency, the scattered field consists of a
family of coupled harmonics at frequencies differing by the frequency of
temporal modulation. Similarly, the temporal modulation induces coupling
between the resonance frequencies, leading to exceptional points at certain
modulation amplitudes. Moreover, the lack of energy conservation causes
scattering coefficients to blow up when (complex) resonances cross the real
axis. We have developed an integral operator approach to characterize the
scattering problem and, for high-contrast scatterers, we present small-volume
asymptotic formulas analogous to the classical results for the static
(unmodulated) case. We conclude the paper with a boundary integral formulation
of the time-modulated problem, which gives an efficient numerical approach and
corroborates the asymptotic formulas.

</p><i>Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>Two recent electronic transport experiments from Columbia University and
Harvard University have reported record high mobility and low channel densities
in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$ monolayers [J. Pack, et al.,
arXiv:2310.19782; A. Y. Joe, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 056303 (2024)]. A
two-dimensional (2D) metal-insulator transition (MIT) is demonstrated in the
Columbia sample at low densities, a regime where the formation of a Wigner
crystal (WC) is theoretically anticipated in the absence of disorder. We employ
the finite-temperature Boltzmann theory to understand the low-temperature
transport properties of monolayer TMDs, taking into account realistic disorder
scattering. We analyze the experimental results, focusing on the 2D MIT
behavior and the influence of temperature and density on mobility and
resistivity in the metallic phase. We provide a discussion of the nontrivial
carrier density dependence of our transport results. Our analysis elucidates
the linear-in-$T$ resistivity in the metallic phase, attributing it to Friedel
oscillations associated with screened charged impurities. Furthermore, we
explore whether Coulomb disorder could lead to the MIT through either a quantum
Anderson localization transition or a classical percolation transition. Our
theoretical estimates of the disorder-induced MIT critical densities, although
smaller, are within a factor of ~2 of the experimental critical density. We
examine the exceptionally high melting temperature ~10 K of WCs observed
experimentally in the MoSe$_2$ systems at low density, an order of magnitude
larger than the pristine melting temperature. This suggests that the observed
2D low-density MIT behavior is likely a result of the complex interplay between
disorder effects and interaction-driven WC physics, offering a comprehensive
understanding of the low-temperature transport phenomena in TMD monolayers.

from communication to transportation, entertainment, and healthcare. Despite
the widespread and mainstream use, current silicon-based devices suffer
significant reliability issues at temperatures exceeding 125 {\deg}C. The
emergent technological frontiers of space exploration, geothermal energy
harvesting, nuclear energy, unmanned avionic systems, and autonomous driving
will rely on control systems, sensors, and communication devices which operate
at temperatures as high as 500 {\deg}C and beyond. At these extreme
temperatures, active (heat exchanger, phase change cooling) or passive (fins
and thermal interface materials) cooling strategies add significant mass and
complication which is often infeasible. Thus, new material solutions beyond
conventional silicon CMOS devices are necessary for high temperature, resilient

</p><i>Kisung Kang, David G. Cahill, André Schleife</i>
<p>Optical and magneto-optical properties of magnetic materials have been widely
exploited to characterize magnetic structures and phenomena, however, their
temperature dependence is not well understood. This study implements the
supercell approach with thermal lattice and magnetic disorders to obtain
optical and magneto-optical spectra at finite temperatures based on
Williams-Lax theory. Our results show that large optical spectrum signals are
generated at photon energies below 1 eV, originating from the phonon- and
magnon-assisted intraband transitions as lattice and magnetic temperatures
increase. In addition, the prominent peak near 2.7 eV is redshifted
proportionally to magnetic temperature but depends much less on lattice
temperature. By analyzing unfolded bands, we show that the reduction of
exchange splitting due to the thermal demagnetization causes this redshift. Our
unfolded electronic band structure with magnetic disorder shows band kinks,
which are characteristic evidence of the coupling between electrons and
magnetic excitations. First-order magneto-optical spectra at finite temperature
are also predicted, but due to their small magnitude suffer more from sampling
errors. We discuss the effect of zero-point vibrations and the connection of
these simulations to the Drude model for intraband transitions.

<h3>Enhanced mobility of quantum droplets in periodic lattices</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yaroslav V. Kartashov, Dmitry A. Zezyulin</i>
<p>We predict that one- and two-dimensional self-bound quantum droplets, forming
in Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) quantum
corrections to the mean-field energy, may demonstrate exceptional mobility in
periodic optical lattices and that they may exhibit considerable displacements
across the lattice, remaining dynamically stable, even under weak initial phase
kicks imparted to them. Mobility properties of quantum droplets are determined
by their internal structure and strongly depend on the number of particles in
them. We find that due to the peculiar effect of the LHY quantum corrections,
odd (i.e., on-site centered) and even (i.e., intersite-centered)
one-dimensional quantum droplets feature alternating mobility and immobility
bands closely corresponding to the regions, where translational perturbation
mode is unstable and stable, respectively. This picture becomes even richer in
two-dimensional case, where odd-odd, even-odd or even-even quantum droplets
also feature alternating mobility and immobility domains, and where,
surprisingly, the droplet may be mobile in one direction, but immobile in the
orthogonal direction. We link changes in mobility properties with multiple
intersections of energy $E(\mu)$ and norm $N(\mu)$ dependencies for droplets
with different internal structure.

intragranular lattice misorientation - present after many thermomechanical
processes - through three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical simulations of
forged Al-7085 with a modified T7452 temper. We utilize near-field high-energy
X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) to measure 3D spatial orientation fields,
and employ a novel reconstruction method that utilizes grain orientation
envelopes measured using far-field HEDM to enable reconstruction of grains with
intragranular orientation spreads >10{\deg}. We construct two primary virtual
polycrystalline specimens for use in crystal plasticity simulations to assess
the effect of appreciable intragranular misorientation on the predicted
deformation response: the first a faithful representation of the HEDM
reconstruction, the second a microstructure with no intragranular
misorientation (i.e., grain-averaged orientations). We find significant
differences in the predicted deformation mechanism activation, distribution of
stress, and distribution of plastic strain between simulations containing
intragranular misorientation and those with homogenized orientations. The
influence of elastic anisotropy is discussed, along with the effects of
intragranular misorientation on fatigue life through the calculation and
analysis of fatigue indicator parameters.

<p>The recent observation of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in the bilayer
nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has garnered significant interests.
While researches have predominantly focused on the role of electron-electron
interactions in the superconducting mechanism, the impact of electron-phonon
coupling (EPC) has remained elusive. In this work, we perform first-principles
calculations to study the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling within
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure and explore of the interplay between EPC and
electronic interactions on the superconductivity by employing functional
renormalization group approach. Our calculations reveal that EPC alone is
insufficient to trigger superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure.
We identify unique out-of-plane and in-plane breathing phonon modes which
selectively couple with the Ni $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, showcasing
an orbital-selective EPC. Within the bilayer two-orbital model, it is revealed
that solely electronic interactions foster $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing characterized
by notable frustration in the band space, leading to a low transition
temperature. Remarkably, we find that this out-of-plane EPC can act in concert
with electronic interactions to promote the onsite and interlayer pairing in
the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, partially releasing the pairing frustration and thus
elevating T$_c$. In contrast, the inclusion of in-plane EPC only marginally
affects the superconductivity, distinct from the cuprates. Potential
experimental implications in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are also discussed.

<p>The high-order Hall effects, which go beyond the ordinary, unlock more
possibilities of electronic transport properties and functionalities. Pioneer
works focus on the manufacture of complex nanostructures with low lattice
symmetry to produce them. In this paper, we theoretically show that such
high-order Hall effects can alternatively be generated by curving a conducting
nanomembrane which is highly tunable and also enables anisotropy. Its Hall
response can be tuned from first to fourth order by simply varying the
direction and magnitude of the applied magnetic field. The dominant Hall
current frequency can also be altered from zero to double, or even four times
that of the applied alternating electric field. This phenomenon is critically
dependent on the occurrence of high-order snake orbits associated with the
effective magnetic-field dipoles and quadruples induced by the curved geometry.
Our results offer pathways for spatially engineering magnetotransport, current
rectification, and frequency multiplication in the bent conducting
nanomembrane.
