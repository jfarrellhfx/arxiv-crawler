<h3>Symmetry-resolved entanglement in fermionic systems with dissipation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12120" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12120</a>

We investigate symmetry-resolved entanglement in out-of-equilibrium fermionic
systems subject to gain and loss dissipation, which preserves the
block-diagonal structure of the reduced density matrix. We derive a
hydrodynamic description of the dynamics of several entanglement-related
quantities, such as the symmetry-resolved von Neumann entropy and the
charge-imbalance-resolved fermionic negativity. We show that all these
quantities admit a hydrodynamic description in terms of entangled
quasiparticles. While the entropy is dominated by dissipative processes, the
resolved negativity is sensitive to the presence of entangled quasiparticles,
and it shows the typical ``rise and fall'' dynamics. Our results hold in the
weak-dissipative hydrodynamic limit of large intervals, long times and weak
dissipation rates.

<h3>Viscoelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (vCANNs) $-$ a  framework for data-driven anisotropic nonlinear finite viscoelasticity</h3>

The constitutive behavior of polymeric materials is often modeled by finite
linear viscoelastic (FLV) or quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) models. These
popular models are simplifications that typically cannot accurately capture the
nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of materials. For example, the success of
attempts to capture strain rate-dependent behavior has been limited so far. To
overcome this problem, we introduce viscoelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural
Networks (vCANNs), a novel physics-informed machine learning framework for
anisotropic nonlinear viscoelasticity at finite strains. vCANNs rely on the
concept of generalized Maxwell models enhanced with nonlinear strain
(rate)-dependent properties represented by neural networks. The flexibility of
vCANNs enables them to automatically identify accurate and sparse constitutive
models of a broad range of materials. To test vCANNs, we trained them on
stress-strain data from Polyvinyl Butyral, the electro-active polymers VHB 4910
and 4905, and a biological tissue, the rectus abdominis muscle. Different
loading conditions were considered, including relaxation tests, cyclic
tension-compression tests, and blast loads. We demonstrate that vCANNs can
learn to capture the behavior of all these materials accurately and
computationally efficiently without human guidance.

<h3>Open-tunneled oxides as intercalation host for multivalent ion (Ca and  Al) batteries: A DFT study</h3>

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are ubiquitous in everyday applications.
However, Lithium (Li) is a limited resource on the planet and is therefore not
sustainable. As an alternative to lithium, earth-abundant and cheaper
multivalent metals such as aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca) have been actively
researched in battery systems. However, finding suitable intercalation hosts
for multivalent-ion batteries is urgently needed. Open-tunneled oxides are a
particular category of microparticles distinguished by the presence of
integrated one-dimensional channels or nanopores. This work focuses on two
promising open-tunnel oxides, viz: Niobium Tungsten Oxide (NTO) and Molybdenum
Vanadium Oxide (MoVO). We find that the MoVO structure can adsorb greater
numbers of multivalent ions than NTO due to its larger surface area and
different shapes. The MoVO structure can adsorb Ca, Li, and Al ions with
adsorption potential at around 4 to 5 eV. However, the adsorption potential for
hexagonal channels of Al ion drops to 1.73 eV because of less channel area. NTO
structure has an insertion/adsorption potential of 4.4 eV, 3.4 eV, and 0.9 eV
for one Li, Ca, and Al, respectively. In general, Ca ion is more adsorbable
than Al ion in both MoVO and NTO structures. Bader charge analysis and charge
density plot reveals the role of charge transfer and ion size on the insertion
of multivalent ions such as Ca and Al into MoVO and NTO systems. Our results
provide general guidelines to explore other multivalent ions for battery
applications.

<h3>Magnetic tuning of the tunnel coupling in an optically active quantum  dot molecule</h3>

<br>
<br>
Self-assembled optically active quantum dot molecules (QDMs) allow the
creation of protected qubits via singlet-triplet spin states. The qubit energy
splitting of these states is defined by the tunnel coupling strength and is,
therefore, determined by the potential landscape and thus fixed during growth.
Applying an in-plane magnetic field increases the confinement of the hybridized
wave functions within the quantum dots, leading to a decrease of the tunnel
coupling strength. We achieve a tuning of the coupling strength by
$(53.4\pm1.7)$ %. The ability to fine-tune this coupling is essential for
quantum network and computing applications that require quantum systems with
near identical performance.

<h3>Universality of the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability by  single-vortex tracking</h3>

At the interface between two fluid layers in relative motion, infinitesimal
fluctuations can be exponentially amplified, inducing vorticity and the
breakdown of the laminar flow. This process, known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability, is responsible for many familiar phenomena observed in the
atmosphere, and the oceans, as well as in astrophysics, and it is one of the
paradigmatic routes to turbulence in fluid mechanics. While in classical
hydrodynamics the instability is ruled by universal scaling laws, to what
extent universality emerges in quantum fluids is yet to be fully understood.
Here, we shed light on this matter by triggering the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability in atomic superfluids across widely different regimes, ranging from
weakly-interacting bosonic to strongly-correlated fermionic pair condensates.
Upon engineering two counter-rotating flows with tunable relative velocity, we
observe how their contact interface develops into an ordered circular array of
quantized vortices, which loses stability and rolls up into clusters in close
analogy with classical Kelvin-Helmholtz dynamics. We extract the instability
growth rates by tracking the position of individual vortices and find that they
follow universal scaling relations, predicted by both classical hydrodynamics
and a microscopic point-vortex model. Our results connect quantum and classical
fluids revealing how the motion of quantized vortices mirrors the interface
dynamics and open the way for exploring a wealth of out-of-equilibrium
phenomena, from vortex-matter phase transitions to the spontaneous emergence of
two-dimensional quantum turbulence .

<h3>Current fluctuations in a semi-infinite line</h3>

<i>Soumyabrata Saha, Tridib Sadhu</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an application of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory to study
current fluctuations in diffusive systems on a semi-infinite line in contact
with a reservoir with a slow coupling. Within this hydrodynamic framework, we
show that the distribution of time-integrated current across the boundary at
large times follows a large deviation principle with a rate function that
depends on the coupling strength with the reservoir. The system exhibits a
long-term memory of its initial state which was earlier reported on an infinite
line and can be described using quenched and annealed averaging on the initial
state. We present an explicit expression of the rate function for independent
particles, which we verify using an exact solution of the microscopic dynamics.
For the symmetric exclusion process we present expression of the first three
cumulants for both quenched and annealed ensemble.

<h3>Viscous heat backflow and temperature resonances in graphite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12777" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12777</a>

Graphite's extreme ability to conduct heat is technologically relevant for a
variety of applications in electronics and thermal management, and
scientifically intriguing for violating Fourier's law. Striking non-diffusive
phenomena such as temperature waves -- where heat transiently backflows from
cooler to warmer regions -- have recently been observed in experiments.
Microscopic theoretical analyses suggested that these phenomena emerge when
momentum-conserving phonon collisions dominate over momentum-relaxing ones,
hinting that under these circumstances heat can behave hydrodynamic-like, and
raising fundamental questions on the existence, possible practical detection,
and technological exploitation of macroscopic hallmarks of viscous heat flow.
Here we rely on the viscous heat equations [Phys. Rev. X 10, 011019 (2020)]
parametrized from first principles to show that viscous heat backflow can
emerge in graphite. We predict the appearance of heat vortices in the
steady-state regime, and we rationalize recent measurements of temperature
waves. We discuss analogies and differences between the temperature waves
emerging from the viscous heat equations and from the inviscid dual-phase-lag
equation, showing that it is necessary to consider viscous effects to
quantitatively rationalize experiments. Finally, we show that viscous
temperature waves can be driven to resonance, proposing setups for their
amplification and detection.

<h3>Active particles with delayed attractions form quaking crystallites</h3>

Perception-reaction delays have experimentally been found to cause a
spontaneous circling of microswimmers around a targeted center. Here we
investigate the many-body version of this experiment with Brownian-dynamics
simulations of active particles in a plane. For short delays, the soft
spherical discs form a hexagonal colloidal crystallite around a fixed target
particle. Upon increasing the delay time, we observe a bifurcation to a chiral
dynamical state that we can map onto that found for a single active particle.
The different angular velocities at different distances from the target induce
shear stresses that grow with increasing delay. As a result, tangential and,
later, also radial shear bands intermittently break the rotating crystallite.
Eventually, for long delays, the discs detach from the target particle to
circle around it near the preferred single-particle orbit, while spinning and
trembling from tidal quakes

<h3>Quasiparticle and Optical Properties of Carrier-Doped Monolayer MoTe$_2$  from First Principles</h3>

The intrinsic weak and highly non-local dielectric screening of
two-dimensional materials is well known to lead to high sensitivity of their
optoelectronic properties to environment. Less studied theoretically is the
role of free carriers on those properties. Here, we use ab initio GW and
Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations, with a rigorous treatment of dynamical
screening and local-field effects, to study the doping-dependence of the
quasiparticle and optical properties of a monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenide, 2H MoTe$_2$. We predict a quasiparticle band gap
renormalization of several hundreds meV for experimentally-achievable carrier
densities, and a similarly sizable decrease in the exciton binding energy. This
results in an almost constant excitation energy for the lowest-energy exciton
resonance with increasing doping density. Using a newly-developed and
generally-applicable quasi-2D plasmon-pole model and a self-consistent solution
of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we reveal the importance of accurately
capturing both dynamical and local-field effects to understand detailed
photoluminescence measurements.

Whirling topological textures play a key role in exotic phases of magnetic
materials and offer promise for logic and memory applications. In
antiferromagnets, these textures exhibit enhanced stability and faster dynamics
with respect to ferromagnetic counterparts, but they are also difficult to
study due to their vanishing net magnetic moment. One technique that meets the
demand of highly sensitive vectorial magnetic field sensing with negligible
backaction is diamond quantum magnetometry. Here, we show that the archetypal
antiferromagnet, hematite, hosts a rich tapestry of monopolar, dipolar and
quadrupolar emergent magnetic charge distributions. The direct readout of the
previously inaccessible vorticity of an antiferromagnetic spin texture provides
the crucial connection to its magnetic charge through a duality relation. Our
work defines a novel paradigmatic class of magnetic systems to explore
two-dimensional monopolar physics, and highlights the transformative role that
diamond quantum magnetometry could play in exploring emergent phenomena in
quantum materials.

<h3>Transient dynamics and quantum phase diagram for the square lattice  Rashba-Hubbard model at arbitrary hole doping</h3>

Adding a Rashba term to the Hubbard Hamiltonian produces a model which can be
used to learn how spin-orbit interactions impact correlated electrons on a
lattice. Previous works have studied such a model using a variety of
theoretical frameworks, mainly close to half-filling. In this work, we
determine the magnetic phase-diagram for the Rashba-Hubbard model for arbitrary
hole doping using a sine square deformed lattice mean-field model with an
unrestricted ansatz, thus suppressing finite size effects. We find that the
introduction of Rashba spin-orbit coupling significantly alters the ground
state properties of the Hubbard model and we observe an increasing complexity
of the ground state phase composition for increasing spin-orbit strength. We
also introduce a gradual deformed envelope (GDE) technique building on the sine
square methodology to facilitate convergence towards ordered and defect-free
ground state configurations which is a challenge with the unrestricted ansatz
at high interaction strengths. We observe that the use of the GDE technique
significantly lowers the free energy of the obtained configurations. Moreover,
we consider transient dynamics in the Rashba-Hubbard model by quenching the
interaction strength. We find that the quench dynamics within a sine-square
methodology allows for the simulation of quasi-open systems by using the
zero-energy edge states as a particle reservoir. Interaction quenches at
half-filling show a tendency towards quench-induced spatial spin-magnitude
inhomogeneity and a non-equilibrium system magnetization lower than equilibrium
predictions, possibly related to a build-up of non-local correlations on the
lattice.

<h3>The topological Hall effect in CeAlGe</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The Weyl semimetal CeAlGe is a promising material to study non-trivial
topologies in real and momentum space due to the presence of a topological
magnetic phase. Our results at ambient pressure show that the electronic
properties of CeAlGe are extremely sensitive to small stoichiometric
variations. In particular, the topological Hall effect (THE) present in CeAlGe
is absent in some samples of almost identical chemical composition. The
application of external pressure favors the antiferromagnetic ground state. It
also induces a THE, where it was not visible at ambient pressure. Furthermore,
a small pressure is sufficient to drive the single region of the THE in
magnetic fields into two different ones. Our results reveal an extreme
sensitivity of the electronic properties of CeAlGe to tiny changes in its
chemical composition, leading to a high tunability by external stimuli. We can
relate this sensitivity to a shift of the Fermi level and to domain walls.

<h3>Comment on "Absence of Off-Diagonal Long- Range Order in hcp He-4  Dislocation Cores"</h3>

We contend that the arguments provided in Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 016001
(2023), purporting to show the absence of off-diagonal long-range order in hcp
He-4 dislocation cores are misleading and incorrect. In particular, the
one-body density matrix averaged over the whole crystalline sample provides no
useful information on the possible superfluid behavior inside the
quasi-one-dimensional core of a dislocation in the crystal.

<h3>Toward Accurate Interpretable Predictions of Materials Properties within  Transformer Language Models</h3>

Property prediction accuracy has long been a key parameter of machine
learning in materials informatics. Accordingly, advanced models showing
state-of-the-art performance turn into highly parameterized black boxes missing
interpretability. Here, we present an elegant way to make their reasoning
transparent. Human-readable text-based descriptions automatically generated
within a suite of open-source tools are proposed as materials representation.
Transformer language models pretrained on 2 million peer-reviewed articles take
as input well-known terms, e.g., chemical composition, crystal symmetry, and
site geometry. Our approach outperforms crystal graph networks by classifying
four out of five analyzed properties if one considers all available reference
data. Moreover, fine-tuned text-based models show high accuracy in the
ultra-small data limit. Explanations of their internal machinery are produced
using local interpretability techniques and are faithful and consistent with
domain expert rationales. This language-centric framework makes accurate
property predictions accessible to people without artificial-intelligence
expertise.

Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from those
observed in the bulk. To investigate the effect of nanoconfinement on water
compressibility, we performed water sorption experiments on two nanoporous
glass samples while concomitantly measuring the speed of longitudinal and shear
ultrasonic waves in these samples. These measurements yield the longitudinal
and shear moduli of the water laden nanoporous glass as a function of relative
humidity that we utilized in the Gassmann theory to infer the bulk modulus of
the confined water. This analysis shows that the bulk modulus (inverse of
compressibility) of confined water is noticeably higher than that of the bulk
water at the same temperature. Moreover, the modulus exhibits a linear
dependence on the Laplace pressure. The results for water, which is a polar
fluid, agree with previous experimental and numerical data reported for
non-polar fluids. This similarity suggests that irrespective of intermolecular
forces, confined fluids are stiffer than bulk fluids. Accounting for fluid
stiffening in nanopores may be important for accurate interpretation of wave
propagation measurements in fluid-filled nanoporous media, including in
petrophysics, catalysis, and other applications, such as in porous materials
characterization.

<h3>Intercalating Helium into A-site Vacant Perovskites</h3>

Evolutionary searches were employed to predict the most stable structures of
perovskites with helium atoms on their A-sites up to pressures of 10 GPa. The
thermodynamics associated with helium intercalation into [CaZr]F6, structure
that [He]2[CaZr]F6 adopts under pressure, and the mechanical properties of the
parent perovskite and helium-bearing phase were studied via density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. The pressure-temperature conditions where the
formation of HeAlF3, HeGaF3, HeInF3, HeScF3 and HeReO3 from elemental helium
and the vacant A-site perovskites is favored were found. Our DFT calculations
show that entropy can stabilize the helium-filled perovskites provided that the
volume that the noble gas atom occupies within their pores is larger than
within the elemental solid at that pressure. We find that helium incorporation
will increase the bulk modulus of AlF3 from a value characteristic of tin to
one characteristic of steel, and hinders rotations of its octahedra that occur
under pressure.

We investigate the crucial role played by a global symmetry in the
purification timescales and the phase transitions of monitored free fermionic
systems separating a mixed and a pure phase. Concretely, we study Majorana and
Dirac circuits with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and U(1) symmetries, respectively. In the
first case, we demonstrate the mixed phase of $L$ sites has a purification
timescale that scales as $\tau_P\sim L \ln L $. At $1\ll t\ll \tau_P$ the
system attains a finite residual entropy, that we use to unveil the critical
properties of the purification transition. In contrast, free fermions with U(1)
manifest a sublinear purification timescale at any measurement rate and an
apparent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criticality. We find the mixed phase
is characterized by $\tau_P\sim L^{\alpha(p)}$, with a continuously varying
exponent $\alpha(p)<1$.

We review recent developments in the research of nonlinear and nonequilibrium
phenomena in solids focusing on their geometrical aspects. We start with
introducing the basic concepts of geometrical phases of Bloch electrons and
Floquet theory for periodically driven systems. Then we review recent attempts
to engineer topological phases in nonequilibrium matters with circularly
polarized light irradiated to graphene, magnets, and superconductors. We next
review a bulk photovoltaic effect of inversion broken materials focusing on the
shift current response. The shift current is described with Berry connections
and has a close relationship to the modern theory of polarization. We further
review recent extensions of the shift current to correlated electron systems.
Finally we explain the geometric diabatic time evolution in Zenner tunneling
process and its consequences on the nonreciprocal transport.

<h3>Electronic Correlation Effects on Stabilizing a Perfect Kagome Lattice  and Ferromagnetic Fluctuation in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$</h3>

<br>
A perfect Kagome lattice features flat bands that usually lead to strong
electronic correlation effects, but how electronic correlation, in turn,
stabilizes a perfect Kagome lattice has rarely been explored. Here, we study
such effect in a superconducting ($T_c \sim 7.8$ K) Kagome metal LaRu$_3$Si$_2$
with a distorted Kagome plane consisting of pure Ru ions, using density
functional theory plus $U$ and plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that
increasing electronic correlation can stabilize a perfect Kagome lattice and
induce substantial ferromagnetic fluctuations in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$. By comparing
the calculated magnetic susceptibilities to experimental data, LaRu$_3$Si$_2$
is found to be on the verge of becoming a perfect Kagome lattice. It thus shows
moderate but non-negligible electronic correlations and ferromagnetic
fluctuations, which are crucial to understanding the experimentally observed
non-Fermi-liquid behavior and the pretty high superconducting $T_c$ of
LaRu$_3$Si$_2$.

Magnon spin transport in a metal-antiferromagnetic insulator-ferromagnetic
insulator heterostructure is considered. The spin current is generated via the
spin Seebeck effect and in the limit of clean sample where the effects of
interface imperfections and lattice defects are excluded. For NiO as an
antiferromagnetic insulator we have a magnetic order of antiferromagnetically
combined planes which are internally in ferromagnetic order. We find that the
sign of the spin current depends on the magnetization direction of the plane
next to the metal resulting in an even-odd effect for the spin current.
Moreover, as long as damping is excluded, this even-odd effect is the only
remaining dependence on the NiO thickness for high temperatures.

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have the potential to
unlock novel photonic and chemical technologies if their optoelectronic
properties can be understood and controlled. Yet, recent work has offered
contradictory explanations for how TMD absorption spectra change with carrier
concentration, fluence, and time. Here, we test our hypothesis that the large
broadening and shifting of the strong band-edge features observed in optical
spectra arise from the formation of negative trions. We do this by fitting an
ab initio based, many-body model to our experimental electrochemical data. Our
approach provides an excellent, global description of the potential-dependent
linear absorption data. We further leverage our model to demonstrate that trion
formation explains the non-monotonic potential dependence of the transient
absorption spectra, including through photoinduced derivative lineshapes for
the trion peak. Our results motivate the continued development of theoretical
methods to describe cutting-edge experiments in a physically transparent way.

Animal cells are both encapsulated and subdivided by lipid bilayer membranes.
Beyond just acting as boundaries, these membranes' shapes influence the
function of cells and their compartments. Physically, membranes are
two-dimensional fluids with complex elastic behavior, which makes it
impossible, for all but a few simple cases, to predict membrane shapes
analytically. Instead, the shape and behavior of biological membranes can be
determined by simulations. However, the setup and use of such simulations
require a significant programming background. The availability of open-source
and user-friendly packages for simulating biological membranes needs
improvement.Here, we present flippy, an open-source package for simulating
lipid membrane shapes, their interaction with proteins or external particles,
and the effect of external forces. Our goal is to provide a tool that is easy
to use without sacrificing performance or versatility. flippy is an
implementation of a dynamically triangulated membrane. We use a precise yet
fast algorithm for calculating the geometric properties of membranes and can
also account for local spontaneous curvature, a feature not all discretizations
allow. Finally, in flippy we can also include regions of purely elastic
(non-fluid) membranes and thus explore various shapes encountered in living
systems.

Holes drilled in a type-II superconductor trap the magnetic flux. Following
Clem's flux pinning model, we consider surface pinning as a mechanism for
compressing the magnetic flux in the holes. Estimations of the trapped magnetic
flux demonstrate that the holes with the diameter up to 2 mm are advantageous
for bulk single-crystal REBCO samples. The REBCO films and tapes can be
improved by the holes with diameter smaller than 10 $\mu$m.

Wave-function methods have offered a robust, systematically improvable means
to study ground-state properties in quantum many-body systems. Theories like
coupled cluster and their derivatives provide highly accurate approximations to
the energy landscape at a reasonable computational cost. Analogs of such
methods to study thermal properties, though highly desirable, have been lacking
because evaluating thermal properties involve a trace over the entire Hilbert
space, which is a formidable task. Besides, excited-state theories are
generally not as well studied as ground-state ones. In this mini-review, we
present an overview of a finite-temperature wave function formalism based on
thermofield dynamics to overcome these difficulties. Thermofield dynamics
allows us to map the equilibrium thermal density matrix to a pure state, i.e.,
a single wave function, albeit in an expanded Hilbert space. Ensemble averages
become expectation values over this so-called thermal state. Around this
thermal state, we have developed a procedure to generalize ground-state wave
function theories to finite temperatures. As explicit examples, we highlight
formulations of mean-field, configuration interaction, and coupled cluster
theories for thermal properties of fermions in the grand-canonical ensemble. To
assess the quality of these approximations, we also show benchmark studies for
the one-dimensional Hubbard model, while comparing against exact results. We
will see that the thermal methods perform similarly to their ground-state
counterparts, while merely adding a pre-factor to the asymptotic computational
cost. They also inherit all the properties, good or bad, from the ground-state
methods, signifying the robustness of our formalism and the scope for future
development.

<h3>Electronic origin of ferro quadrupole moment under antiferro quadrupole  orders and finite magnetic moment in $J_{\rm eff}=3/2$ systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Haruhiro Kubo, Takayuki Ishitobi, Kazumasa Hattori</i>
<br>
<br>
We study electronic origin of parasitic ferroic quadrupole moments in
antiferroic quadrupole orders by extending a model studied in G. Chen et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 82, 174440 (2010) with the effective angular momentum $J_{\rm
eff}=3/2$ quartet ground states. Taking account the first
crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excited doublet, cubic anisotropy in the
quadrupole moments emerges, which leads to the induced ferroic quadrupole
moments in the antiferro quadrupolar phases. The hybridization with the CEF
excited quartet states also causes finite magnetic moments compatible to the
observed size of the effective moment in typical $J_{\rm eff}=3/2$ systems, as
opposed to the naive expectation of vanishing moments in the $J_{\rm eff}=3/2$
systems. These results suggest the importance of the corrections arising from
the high-energy CEF excited states in the $J_{\rm eff}=3/2$ systems.

<h3>Time-resolved single-particle spectrum of the one-dimensional extended  Hubbard model after interaction quenches</h3>

<br>
<i>Yong-Guang Su, Ruifeng Lu, Hantao Lu, Can Shao</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional extended
Hubbard model after interaction quenches. In strong-coupling regime with large
on-site interaction, the ground states of this model with small and large
nearest-neighbor interactions are in spin-density-wave and charge-density-wave
phases, respectively. Combining twisted boundary conditions with the
time-dependent Lanczos method, we obtain snapshots of the time-dependent
single-particle spectrum after quenches. We find that for quench within the
same phase, the single-particle spectrum becomes close to that of the quenched
Hamiltonian immediately after the quench. While for quench across the critical
point, the afterward evolution process depends mainly on the distribution of
the initial state among the eigenstates of the quenched Hamiltonian. Our
finding may serve as a way to detect the phase transition in ultracold atom
systems with interactions.

<h3>Boltzmann entropy of a freely expanding quantum ideal gas</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the time evolution of the Boltzmann entropy of a microstate during
the non-equilibrium free expansion of a one-dimensional quantum ideal gas. This
quantum Boltzmann entropy, $S_B$, essentially counts the "number" of
independent wavefunctions (microstates) giving rise to a specified macrostate.
It generally depends on the choice of macrovariables, such as the type and
amount of coarse-graining, specifying a non-equilibrium macrostate of the
system, but its extensive part agrees with the thermodynamic entropy in thermal
equilibrium macrostates. We examine two choices of macrovariables: the
$U$-macrovariables are local observables in position space, while the
$f$-macrovariables also include structure in momentum space. For the quantum
gas, we use a non-classical choice of the $f$-macrovariables. For both choices,
the corresponding entropies $s_B^f$ and $s_B^U$ grow and eventually saturate.
As in the classical case, the growth rate of $s_B^f$ depends on the momentum
coarse-graining scale. If the gas is initially at equilibrium and is then
released to expand to occupy twice the initial volume, the per-particle
increase in the entropy for the $f$-macrostate, $\Delta s_B^f$, satisfies
$\log{2}\leq\Delta s_B^f\leq 2\log{2}$ for fermions, and $0\leq\Delta
s_B^f\leq\log{2}$ for bosons. For the same initial conditions, the change in
the entropy $\Delta s_B^U$ for the $U$-macrostate is greater than $\Delta
s_B^f$ when the gas is in the quantum regime where the final stationary state
is not at thermal equilibrium.

We have performed large-scale density-matrix renormalization group studies of
the lightly doped Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice on long three and
four-leg cylinders. We find that the ground state of the system upon lightly
doping is consistent with that of a superconducting state with coexisting
quasi-long-range superconducting and charge density wave orders. Both the
superconducting and charge density wave correlations decay as a power law at
long distances with corresponding exponents $K_{sc}<2$ and $K_c<2$. On the
contrary, the spin-spin and single-particle correlations decay exponentially,
although with relatively long correlation lengths.

<h3>Twisted bilayer graphene reveals its flat bands under spin pumping</h3>

<br>
<i>Sonia Haddad, Takeo Kato, Lassaad Mandhour</i>
<br>
<br>
The salient property of the electronic band structure of twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG), at the so-called magic angle (MA), is the emergence of flat
bands around the charge neutrality point. These bands are associated with the
observed superconducting phases and the correlated insulating states occurring
at the MA. Scanning tunneling microscopy combined with angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy are usually used to visualize the flatness of the
band structure of the TGB at the MA. Here, we theoretically argue that spin
pumping (SP) provides a direct probe of the flat bands of TBG and an accurate
determination of the MA. We consider a junction separating a ferromagnetic
insulator and an heterostructure of TBG adjacent to a monolayer of a transition
metal dichalcogenide. We show that the Gilbert damping of the ferromagnetic
resonance experiment through this junction depends on the twist angle of TBG,
and shows a sharp drop at the MA. Our results open the way to a twist
switchable spintronics in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

Understanding how a stressor applied on a biological system shapes its
evolution is key to achieving targeted evolutionary control. Here we present a
toy model of two interacting lattice proteins to quantify the response to the
selective pressure defined by the binding energy. We generate sequence data of
proteins and study how the sequence and structural properties of dimers are
affected by the applied selective pressure, both during the evolutionary
process and in the stationary regime. In particular we show that internal
contacts of native structures lose strength, while inter-structure contacts are
strengthened due to the folding-binding competition. We discuss how
dimerization is achieved through enhanced mutability on the interacting faces,
and how the designability of each native structure changes upon introduction of
the stressor.

The Letter studies the unoccupied states of Tl/Si(111) by spin-resolved
inverse photoemission (IPES) using a rotatable electron source. Authors claim
that the spin polarization rotates from an in-plane Rashba polarization at
$\Gamma$ to the surface normal at K(K') valleys. This Comment first indicates
that the in-plane polarization does not vanish at the valleys despite the
claims and the data representation. Second, it highlights that the out-of-plane
polarization cannot be straightforwardly measured. Hypothesis and/or
unspecified data treatment are needed to experimentally conclude on the
polarization rotation and the completely out-of-plane spin-polarized valleys.

<br>
<br>
We report crystal structure and magnetic behavior of the triangular
antiferromagnet KYbO$_2$, the A-site substituted version of the quantum spin
liquid candidate NaYbO$_2$. The replacement of Na by K introduces an
anisotropic tensile strain with 1.6% in-plane and 12.1% out-of-plane lattice
expansion. Compared to NaYbO$_2$, both Curie-Weiss temperature and saturation
field are reduced by about 20% as the result of the increased Yb--O--Yb angles,
whereas the $g$-tensor of Yb$^{3+}$ becomes isotropic with $g=3.08(3)$.
Field-dependent magnetization shows the plateau at 1/2 of the saturated value
and suggests the formation of the up-up-up-down field-induced order in the
triangular AYbO$_2$ oxides (A = alkali metal), in contrast to the isostructural
selenides that exhibit the 1/3 plateau and the up-up-down field-induced order.

The paper presents the low temperature expansion of the 2D Ising model in the
presence of the magnetic field in powers of $x=\exp(-J/(kT))$ and
$z=\exp(B/(kT))$ with full polynomials in $z$ up to $x^{88}$ and full
polynomials in $x^4$ up to $z^{-60}$, in the latter case the polynomials are
explicitly given. The new result presented in the paper is an expansion not in
inverse powers of $z$ but in $(z^2+x^8)^{-k}$ where the subsequent coefficients
(polynomials in $x^4$) turn out to be divisible by increasing powers of
$(1-x^4)$. The paper describes both the analytic expansions of the partition
function and the efficient combinatorial methods to get the coefficients of the
expansion.

Fluidic channels with physical dimensions approaching molecular sizes are
crucial for novel desalination, chemical separation, and sensing technologies.
However, fabrication of precisely controlled fluidic channels in the angstrom
size is extremely challenging. This, along with our limited understanding of
nanofluidic transport, hinders practical applications. Here, we fabricated
high-quality salt-intercalated vermiculite membranes with channel sizes 3-5
Angstrom, highly dependent on intercalant. Unlike pristine samples, the
salt-intercalated membranes are highly stable in water. We tested several such
membranes, of which 0.6 micron thick membranes showed dye rejection
efficiencies greater than 98 percent with exceptionally high water permeance of
5400 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 at a differential pressure of 0.9 bar. Interestingly, the
same membrane also rejected NaCl ions, with efficiencies of 95 percent. Our
highly confined channels exhibit sub-linear ionic conductance related to
hydration sizes, steric exclusion, K+ mobility enhancement, and conductance
saturation at concentrations less than or equal to 10 mM. This makes highly
confined channels interesting for both fundamental science and applications.

Functional materials that enable many technological applications in our
everyday lives owe their unique properties to defects that are carefully
engineered and incorporated into these materials during processing. However,
optimizing and characterizing these defects is very challenging in practice,
making computational modelling an indispensable complementary tool. We have
developed an automated workflow and code to accelerate these calculations
(AiiDA-defects), which utilises the AiiDA framework, a robust open-source
high-throughput materials informatics infrastructure that provides workflow
automation while simultaneously preserving and storing the full data provenance
in a relational database that is queryable and traversable. This paper
describes the design and implementation details of AiiDA-defects, the models
and algorithms used, and demonstrates its use in an application to fully
characterize the defect chemistry of the well known solid-state Li-ion
conductors LiZnPS 4 . We anticipate that AiiDA-defects will be useful as a tool
for fully automated and reproducible defect calculations, allowing detailed
defect chemistry to be obtained in a reliable and high-throughput way, and
paving the way toward the generation of defects databases for accelerated

All solids yield under sufficiently high mechanical loads. Below yield, the
mechanical responses of all disordered solids are nearly alike, but above yield
every different disordered solid responds in its own way. Brittle systems can
shatter without warning, like ordinary window glass, or exhibit strain
localization prior to fracture, like metallic or polymeric glasses. Ductile
systems, e.g. foams like shaving cream or emulsions like mayonnaise, can flow
indefinitely with no strain localization. While there are empirical strategies
for tuning the degree of strain localization, there is no framework that
explains their effectiveness or limitations. We show that
Structuro-Elastoplastic (StEP) models provide microscopic understanding of how
strain localization depends on the interplay of structure, plasticity and
elasticity.

We consider the problem of the development of steady states in
one-dimensional Bose gas tubes that are weakly coupled to one another through a
density-density interaction. We analyze this development through a Boltzmann
collision integral approach. We argue that when the leading order of the
collision integral, where single particle-hole excitations are created in
individual gases, is dominant, the state of the gas evolves first to a
non-thermal fixed point, i.e. a prethermalization plateau. This order is
dominant when a pair of tubes are inequivalent with, say, different
temperatures or different effective interaction parameters, $\gamma$. We
characterize this non-thermal prethermalization plateau, constructing both the
quasi-conserved quantities that control the existence of this plateau as well
as the associated generalized Gibbs ensemble.

In this article, we unravel the problem of interpreting the density scaling
exponent for the polyatomic molecules representing the real van der Waals
liquids. Our studies show that the density scaling exponent is a weighted
average of the exponents of the repulsive terms of all interatomic interactions
occurring between molecules, wherein the potential energy of a given
interaction represents its weight. It implies that potential energy is a key
quantity required to calculate the density scaling exponent value for real
molecules. Finally, we use the well-known method for potential energy
estimation and show that the density scaling exponent could be successfully
predicted from the liquid structure for fair representatives of the real
systems.

<br>
<br>
Barium zirconate (BaZrO$_3$) is one of the very few perovskites that is
claimed to retain an average cubic structure down to \SI{0}{\K}, while being
energetically very close to an antiferrodistortive phase obtained by
condensation of a soft phonon mode at the R point of the Brillouin zone
boundary. In this work, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study
of the temperature dependence of this soft phonon mode. Inelastic neutron and
x-ray scattering measurements on single crystals show that it softens
substantially from \SI{9.4}{\meV} at room temperature to \SI{5.6}{\meV} at
\SI{2}{\K}. In contrast, the acoustic mode at the same R point is nearly
temperature independent. The effect of the anharmonicity on the lattice
dynamics is investigated non-perturbatively using direct dynamic simulations as
well as a first-principles based self-consistent phonon theory, including
quantum fluctuations of the atomic motion. By adding cubic and quartic
anharmonic force constants, quantitative agreement with the neutron data for
the temperature dependence of the antiferrodistortive mode is obtained. The
quantum fluctuations of the atomic motion are found to be important to obtain
the proper temperature dependence at low temperatures. The mean squared
displacements of the different atoms are determined as function of temperature
and are shown to be consistent with available experimental data. Adding
anharmonicity to the computed fluctuations of the Ba-O distances also improves
the comparison with available EXAFS data at \SI{300}{\K}.

Single-crystal whiskers of REBa2Cu3Ox (RE-123, RE: rare earth element)
cuprate superconductors were successfully grown using Te-doped precursors
utilizing the concept of high-entropy-alloys (HEAs) at the RE site. The
obtained whiskers were 0.5-1.0 mm length with approximately 10 um thickness.
The width of the flat surface, which corresponds to the ab-plane, was 10-50 um.
The RE site of the grown whiskers could be easily substituted by large ionic
radius RE elements (Gd, Dy, and Ho). Substitution with small ionic radius RE
elements (Tm, Yb, and Lu) resulted in the opposite trend. The superconducting
transition temperature and superconducting anisotropy of the grown RE-123
whiskers were 89-93 K and 6-10, respectively. The mixed entropy at the RE site
in the RE-123 whiskers did not affect the superconducting transition
temperature and superconducting anisotropy.

The ferroelectric material usually exhibits temperature dependent spontaneous
polarization, known as pyroelectricity, which can be used to directly convert
thermal energy to electricity from ambient low-grade waste heat. When utilizing
the structural phase transformations of the material, the conversion capability
can be magnified, consequently the device performance can be strongly boosted
by orders of magnitude. However, common ferroelectric oxides suffer the
mechanical fatigue and functional degradation over cyclic phase
transformations, hindering widespread applications of the energy conversion
device. In this paper, we investigate the mechanical and functional
reversibility of the material by lattice tuning and grain coarsening. We
discover the lead-free compound
Ba(Ce$_{0.005}$Zr$_{0.005}$)Ti$_{0.99}$O3-0.10(Ba$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$)TiO$_3$
(BCZT-0.10BCT) satisfying the compatibility condition among all present phases
by its lattice parameters, making the phase transformations highly reversible.
We demonstrated that the energy conversion device with the equiaxial coarse
grains exhibits exceptional fatigue-resistance, with stable pyroelectric
current output at 4$\mu$A/cm$^2$ over 3,000 energy conversion cycles. Our work
opens a new way to fabricate high-performance material that advances the

We theoretically analyze phonon-assisted tunneling transport in a quantum dot
side-connected to a Majorana bound state in a topological superconducting
nanowire. We investigate the behavior of the current through the dot, for a
range of experimentally relevant parameters, in the presence of one long-wave
optical phonon. We consider the current-gate voltage, the current-bias voltage,
and the current-dot-Majorana coupling characteristics under the influence of
the electron-phonon coupling. In the absence of electron-phonon interaction,
the Majorana bound states suppress the current when the gate voltage matches
the Fermi level, but the increase of the bias voltage counteracts this effect.
In the presence of electron-phonon coupling, the current behaves similarly as a
function of the renormalized gate voltage. As an added feature at large bias
voltages, it presents a dip or a plateau, depending on the size of dot-Majorana
coupling. Lastly, we show that the currents are most sensitive to, and depend
non-trivially on the parameters of the Majorana circuit element, in the regime
of low temperatures combined with low voltages. Our results provide insights
into the complex physics of quantum dot devices used to probe Majorana bound
states.

Topological edge states have been widely investigated in different types of
lattices. In the present work, we report on topological edge states in
double-wave potential chains, which can be described by a generalized
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, applied to a driven-dissipative exciton
polariton system. We show that in such potential chains, different types of
edge states can form. For resonant optical excitation, the nonlinearity
resulting from the repulsive polariton-polariton interaction leads to a
multistability of different edge states that are stabilized for the same set of
system and excitation parameters. This includes topologically protected edge
states evolved directly from the individual linear eigenmodes of the system as
well as additional edge states that originate from the localization of bulk
states in the presence of nonlinearity. Generally, the interplay of topological
localization and nonlinearity opens up exciting prospects for functional
topological structures.

Inspired from electronic systems, topological photonics aims to engineer new
optical devices with robust properties. In many cases, the ideas from
topological phases protected by internal symmetries in fermionic systems are
extended to those protected by crystalline symmetries. One such popular
photonic crystal model was proposed by Wu and Hu in 2015 for realizing a
bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological crystalline insulator with robust
topological edge states, which led to intense theoretical and experimental
studies. However, rigorous relationship between the bulk topology and edge
properties for this model, which is central to evaluating its advantage over
traditional photonic designs, has never been established. In this work we
revisit the expanded and shrunken honeycomb lattice structures proposed by Wu
and Hu by using topological quantum chemistry tools and show that they are
topologically trivial in the sense that symmetric, localized Wannier functions
can be constructed. We show that the $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ type
classification of the Wu-Hu model are equivalent to the $C_2T$ protected Euler
class and the second Stiefel-Whitney class respectively, with the latter
characterizing the full valence bands of Wu-Hu model indicating only a higher
order topological insulator (HOTI) phase. We show that the Wu-Hu interface
states can be gapped by a uniform topology preserving $C_6$ and $T$ symmetric
perturbation, which demonstrates the trivial nature of the interface. Our
results reveals that topology is not a necessary condition for the reported
helical edge states in many photonics systems and opens new possibilities for
interface engineering that may not be constrained to require topological
designs.

Bilayer graphene (BLG) was recently shown to host a band-inverted phase with
unconventional topology emerging from the Ising-type spin--orbit interaction
(SOI) induced by the proximity of transition metal dichalcogenides with large
intrinsic SOI. Here, we report the stabilization of this band-inverted phase in
BLG symmetrically encapsulated in tungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) via hydrostatic
pressure. Our observations from low temperature transport measurements are
consistent with a single particle model with induced Ising SOI of opposite sign
on the two graphene layers. To confirm the strengthening of the inverted phase,
we present thermal activation measurements and show that the SOI-induced band
gap increases by more than 100% due to the applied pressure. Finally, the
investigation of Landau level spectra reveals the dependence of the
level-crossings on the applied magnetic field, which further confirms the
enhancement of SOI with pressure.

Non Efimovian $N$-body resonances are investigated in the regime of a large
two-body s wave scattering length. In view of a universal description of
low-energy bound and quasi-bound states, a contact model is introduced. The
modeling requires two parameters in addition to the scattering length. Using a
modified scalar product, the contact model provides a normalization of bound
states, possibly not square-integrable, that coincides with that of the
corresponding finite range model.

Crystal field level scheme of a uniaxial chiral helimagnet YbNi$_3$Al$_9$,
exhibiting a chiral magnetic soliton lattice state by Cu substitution for Ni,
has been determined by inelastic neutron scattering. The ground and the first
excited doublets are separated by 44 K and are simply expressed as $\alpha|\pm
7/2\rangle + \beta |\mp 5/2\rangle$ with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ nearly equal to
$\pm 1/\sqrt{2}$. The easy axis of the crystal field anisotropy is the $c$ axis
when the excited levels are populated at high temperatures and high magnetic
fields. On the other hand, the magnetism at low temperatures and low magnetic
fields, where only the ground doublet is populated, is described by an easy
plane anisotropy which may be treated as an $S=1/2$ system with an anisotropic
$g$-factor, $g_{xy}=3.02$ and $g_z=1.14$. An orbital dependent exchange
interaction is also discussed to explain the temperature dependence of the
magnetic susceptibility based on this level scheme.

At room temperature, bismuth undergoes several structural transitions with
increasing pressure before taking on a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase at
approximately 8 GPa. The bcc structure is stable to the highest measured
pressure and its simplicity, along with its high compressibility and atomic
number, make it an enticing choice as a pressure calibrant. We present three
data sets on the compression of bismuth in a diamond anvil cell in a neon
pressure medium, up to a maximum pressure of about 260 GPa. The use of a soft
pressure medium reduces deviatoric stress when compared to previous work. With
an expanded pressure range, higher point density, and a decreased uniaxial
stress component, we are able to provide more reliable equation of state (EOS)
parameters. We also conduct density functional theory (DFT)
electronic-structure calculations that confirm the stability of the bcc phase
at high pressure.

Characterizing crystal structures and interfaces down to the atomic level is
an important step for designing novel materials. Modern electron microscopy
routinely achieves atomic resolution and is capable to resolve complex
arrangements of atoms with picometer precision. Here, we present AI-STEM, an
automatic, artificial-intelligence based method, for accurately identifying key
characteristics from atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) images of polycrystalline materials. The method is based on a
Bayesian convolutional neural network (BNN) that is trained only on simulated
images. Excellent performance is achieved for automatically identifying crystal
structure, lattice orientation, and location of interface regions in synthetic
and experimental images. The model yields classifications and uncertainty
estimates through which both bulk and interface regions are identified.
Notably, no explicit information on structural patterns at the interfaces is
provided during training. This work combines principles from probabilistic
modeling, deep learning, and information theory, enabling automatic analysis of
experimental, atomic-resolution images.

<h3>Revisiting power-law distributions in empirical outage data of power  systems</h3>

The size distribution of planned and forced outages in power systems have
been studied for almost two decades and has drawn great interest as they
display heavy tails. Understanding of this phenomenon has been done by various
threshold models, which are self-tuned at their critical points, but as many
papers pointed out, explanations are intuitive, and more empirical data is
needed to support hypotheses. In this paper, the authors analyze outage data
collected from various public sources to calculate the outage energy and outage
duration exponents of possible power-law fits. Temporal thresholds are applied
to identify crossovers from initial short-time behavior to power-law tails. We
revisit and add to the possible explanations of the uniformness of these
exponents. By performing power spectral analyses on the outage event time
series and the outage duration time series, it is found that, on the one hand,
while being overwhelmed by white noise, outage events show traits of
self-organized criticality (SOC), which may be modeled by a crossover from
random percolation to directed percolation branching process with dissipation.
On the other hand, in responses to outages, the heavy tails in outage duration
distributions could be a consequence of the highly optimized tolerance (HOT)
mechanism, based on the optimized allocation of maintenance resources.
