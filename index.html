<h3>Tunable viscous layers in Corbino geometry using density junctions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00381" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00381</a>

</p><i>Ramal Afrose, Aydin Cem Keser, Oleg Sushkov, Shaffique Adam</i>
<p>In sufficiently clean materials where electron-electron interactions are
strong compared to momentum-relaxing scattering processes, electron transport
resembles the flow of a viscous fluid. We study hydrodynamic electron transport
across density interfaces (n-n junctions) in a 2DEG in the Corbino geometry.
From numerical simulations in COMSOL using realistic parameters, we show that
we can produce tunable viscous layers at the density interface by varying the
density ratio of charge carriers. We quantitatively explain this observation
with simple analytic expressions together with boundary conditions at the
interface. We also show signatures of these viscous layers in the
magnetoresistance. Breaking down viscous and ohmic contributions, we find that
when outer radial region of the Corbino has higher charge density compared to
the inner region, the viscous layers at the interface serve to suppress the
magneto-resistance produced by momentum-relaxing scattering. Conversely, the
magneto-resistance is enhanced when the inner region has higher density than
the outer. Our results add to the repertoire of techniques for engineering
viscous electron flows, which hold a promise for applications in future
electronic devices.

<p>Two of the most influential exact results for classical one-dimensional
diffusive transport are the exact results of current statistics for the
symmetric simple exclusion process in the stationary state on a finite line

<h3>Role of stress/strain in tailoring the magnetic and transport properties  of magnetic thin films and multilayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00049</a>

</p><i>Arun Singh Dev, Dileep Kumar</i>
<p>Magnetic anisotropy is a fundamental property of magnetic materials that
determines the alignment of the spins along the preferential direction, called
the easy axis of magnetization. Magnetic polycrystalline thin films offer
several advantages over magnetic epitaxial thin films because of fabrication
flexibility, higher coercivity and improved magnetic stability, higher
magnetoresistance (useful in magneto-resistive devices such as magnetic field
sensors and MRAM cells), cost-effectiveness and thermal stability, etc. In the
case of polycrystalline thin films or multilayers, Magneto-crystalline
anisotropy (MCA) is not expected due to the random orientation of grains.
Therefore, understanding the origin of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) is
generally difficult and can't be understood in terms of crystal orientation.
The origin of UMA in polycrystalline films is often related to the preparation
conditions and substrate properties. In the present thesis, we have provided
direct in-situ real-time evidence of the stress dependence of magnetic
anisotropy through the multibeam optical stress sensor (MOSS) technique. Also,
we have tuned the magnetic anisotropy in strength and direction using
externally applied stress. To further increase the strength of the magnetic
anisotropy, we have developed a new technique that creates a multilayer using a
single magnetic material through sequential oblique and normal depositions.
This oblique angle deposition technique also helps reduce the penetration of
the top ferromagnetic layer inside the organic semiconductor layer in organic
spin valve structures. We confirm our results through various in-situ (in UHV
and HV) and ex-situ temperature-dependent conventional and unconventional
structural, morphological, and magnetic measurements (both lab-based and
synchrotron-based) that include MOKE, KERR, GIXRD, AFM, RHEED, and GISAXS, etc.

<h3>Microstructural and Transport Characteristics of Triply Periodic  Bicontinuous Materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00057</a>
<br>
</p><i>Salvatore Torquato, Jaeuk Kim</i>
<p>3D bicontinuous two-phase materials are increasingly gaining interest because
of their unique multifunctional characteristics and advancements in techniques
to fabricate them. Due to their complex topological and structural properties,
it still has been nontrivial to develop explicit microstructure-dependent
formulas to predict accurately their physical properties. A primary goal of the
present paper is to ascertain various microstructural and transport
characteristics of five different models of triply periodic bicontinuous porous
materials at a porosity $\phi_1=1/2$: those in which the two-phase interfaces
are the Schwarz P, Schwarz D and Schoen G minimal surfaces as well as two
different pore-channel structures. We ascertain their spectral densities,
pore-size distribution functions, local volume-fraction variances, and
hyperuniformity order metrics and then use this information to estimate certain
effective transport properties via closed-form microstructure-property
formulas. Specifically, we estimate the recently introduced time-dependent
diffusion spreadability exactly from the spectral density. Moreover, we
accurately estimate the fluid permeability of such porous materials from the
second moment of the pore-size function and the formation factor, a measure of
the tortuosity of the pore space. We also rigorously bound the permeability
from above using the spectral density. For the five models with identical cubic
unit cells, we find that the permeability, inverse of the specific surface,
hyperuniformity order metric, pore-size second moment and long-time
spreadability behavior are all positively correlated and rank order the
structures in exactly the same way. We also conjecture what structures maximize
the fluid permeability for arbitrary porosities and show that this conjecture
must be true in the extreme porosity limits by identifying the corresponding
optimal structures.

<h3>Dipole-Obstructed Cooper Pairing: Theory and Application to $j=3/2$  Superconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00091" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00091</a>
<br>
</p><i>Penghao Zhu, Rui-Xing Zhang</i>
<p>Like electrons, Cooper pairs can carry a monopole charge if the pairing
electrons come from two or more Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers. In
such an instance, a superconductor is necessarily nodal due to an inherent
topological pairing obstruction. In this work, we show that a similar
obstruction is also possible when there is only one Fermi surface involved in
the pairing process. By developing a Chern-vorticity theorem, we have
identified a class of Fermi surfaces with a quantized dipolar Berry flux
pattern, where all intra-Fermi-surface Cooper pairings are ``dipole-obstructed"
and nodal. As a real-world application, we find that the dipole obstruction
plays a crucial role in stabilizing the superconducting nodal structure for
$j=3/2$ half-Heusler compounds.

<h3>Type II t-J model in charge transfer regime in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$  and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00092" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00092</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hanbit Oh, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</i>
<p>Recent observations of an 80 K superconductor in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high
pressure have attracted significant attention. Recent experiments indicate that
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may be in the charge transfer regime, challenging the
previous models based purely on the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. In
this study, we propose a low energy model that incorporates doped holes in the
oxygen $p$ orbitals. Given that the parent nickel state is in the $3d^{8}$
configuration with a spin-one moment, doped hole only screens it down to
spin-half, in contrast to the Zhang-Rice singlet in cuprate. We dub the single
hole state as Zhang-Rice spin-half and build an effective model which includes
three spin-one states ($d^8$) and two Zhang-Rice spin-half states ($d^8 L$). At
moderate pressure around $20$ GPa, the dominated oxygen orbital is an in-plane
Wannier orbital with the same lattice symmetry as the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital.
The resulting model reduces to the bilayer type II t-J model previously
proposed in the Mott-Hubbard regime. Notably, the hopping between the in-plane
$p$ orbitals of the two layers is still suppressed. Density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) simulation reveals a pairing dome with the optimal
hole doping level at $x=0.4\sim0.5$, distinct from the hole doped cuprate where
optimal doping occurs around $x=0.19$. Further increasing pressure initially
raises the critical temperature ($T_c$) until reaching an optimal pressure
beyond which the $p_z$ orbital of oxygen becomes favorable and
superconductivity is diminished. This shift from in-plane $p$ orbital to $p_z$
orbital may elucidate the experimentally observed superconducting dome with
varying pressure. As an extension, we also suggest a trilayer version of the
type II t-J model as the minimal model for pressured La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$,
which is distinct from the models in the Mott-Hubbard regime.

<h3>Quantum Entanglement In Mixed-Spin Trimmer: Effects of A Magnetic Field  And Heterogeneous g-Factors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00178</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zhirayr Adamyan, Vadim Ohanyan</i>
<p>Mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) trimmer with two different Land\'{e} g-factors and two
different exchange couplings is considered. The main feature of the model is
non-conserving magnetization. The Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized
analytically. We presented a detailed analysis of the ground state properties,
revealing several possible ground state phase diagrams and magnetization
profiles. The main focus is on how non-conserving magnetization affects quantum
entanglement. We have found that non-conserving magnetization can bring to the
continuous dependence of the entanglement quantifying parameter (negativity) on
magnetic field within the same eigenstate, while for the case of uniform
$g$-factors it is a constant. The main result is an essential enhancement of
the entanglement in case of uniform couplings for one pair of spins caused by
an arbitrary small difference in the values of $g$-factors. This enhancement is
robust and brings to almost 7-fold increasing of the negativity. We have also
found weakening of entanglement for other cases. Thus, non-conserving
magnetization offers a broad opportunity to manipulate the entanglement by
means of magnetic field.

<h3>A momentum-space theory for topological magnons in 2D ferromagnetic  skyrmion lattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00192" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00192</a>
<br>
</p><i>Doried Ghader, Bilal Jabakhanji</i>
<p>Magnon dynamics in skyrmion lattices have garnered significant interest due
to their potential applications in topological magnonics. Existing theories
often follow a single-momentum approach, assuming significant
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) to minimize the skyrmion's dimensions,
which can lead to oversimplification in describing magnon behavior. This study
introduces a multi-momentum operator theory for magnons in large 2D skyrmions,
where each skyrmion encompasses several thousand spins. The proposed theory
fully transforms the magnon Hamiltonian into momentum space, incorporating
off-diagonal terms to capture umklapp scattering caused by the skyrmion wave
vectors. Our results reveal deviations from single-momentum theories,
demonstrating that flat bands are not universal features of the skyrmionic
magnon spectrum. Additionally, we find that manipulating the skyrmion size with
an external magnetic field induces multiple topological phase transitions. At
high magnetic fields, the low-energy magnon spectrum becomes densely packed and
entirely topological, resembling a topological band continuum.

<h3>Room-temperature optomechanics with light-matter condensates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00195" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00195</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vladislav Yu. Shishkov, Evgeny S. Andrianov, Anton V. Zasedatelev</i>
<p>In this work, we develop an optomechanical formalism for macroscopic quantum
states in exciton-polariton systems with strong exciton-phonon interactions. We
show that polariton optomechanical interactions induce dynamical backaction,
resulting in dispersive and dissipative shifts in the complex vibrational
response functions. Unlike conventional optomechanical systems, polariton
optomechanics features high-dimensionality and phase-space confinement due to
the dispersion relations of exciton-polaritons. Consequently, vibrational modes
exhibit effective positive or negative mass depending on the detuning
parameter, and are capable for the vibrational Bose condensation under the
resonant conditions. We demonstrate the potential for vibrational control of
polariton condensates at room temperature.

<h3>Deposition of highly-crystalline AlScN thin films using synchronized  HiPIMS -- from combinatorial screening to piezoelectric devices</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jyotish Patidar, Kerstin Thorwarth, Thorsten Schmitz-Kempen, Roland Kessels, Sebastian Siol</i>
<p>Fueled by the 5G revolution, the demand for advanced radio frequency
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based on AlScN is growing rapidly.
However, synthesizing high-quality, textured AlScN thin films is challenging.
Current approaches typically rely on high temperatures and expensive compound
targets. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of ionized physical
vapor deposition to deposit highly oriented AlScN films with minimal defects at
lower temperatures. Using metal-ion synchronized high-power impulse magnetron
co-sputtering (MIS-HiPIMS) we can selectively bombard the growing film with Al
and/or Sc ions to enhance the adatom mobility while simultaneously providing
the ability to tune stress and coat complex structures conformally. We find
that the Sc solubility in wurtzite AlN is slightly reduced, whereas
crystallinity and texture are markedly improved. Disoriented grains, a key
challenge in growing AlScN films, are completely removed via substrate biasing,
while the residual stress can be tailored by adjusting the same. The measured
piezoelectric response of the films is in line with DFT predictions and on par
with the current state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate conformal deposition
of c-axis textured AlScN on structured Si wafers underlining the promise of
ionized PVD for the fabrication of advanced RF filters and next-generation MEMS
devices.

<h3>Analytical solutions of symmetric isotropic spin clusters</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Thomas D. Kühne</i>
<p>Spin models like the Heisenberg Hamiltonian effectively describe the
interactions of open-shell transition-metal ions on a lattice and can account
for various properties of magnetic solids and molecules. Numerical methods are
usually required to find exact or approximate eigenstates, but for small
clusters with spatial symmetry, analytical solutions exist, and a few
Heisenberg systems have been solved in closed form. This paper presents a
simple, generally applicable approach to analytically solve isotropic spin
clusters, based on adapting the basis to both total-spin and point-group
symmetry to factor the Hamiltonian matrix into sufficiently small blocks. We
demonstrate applications to small rings and polyhedra, some of which are
straightforward to solve by successive spin-coupling for Heisenberg terms only;
additional interactions, such as biquadratic exchange or multi-center terms
necessitate symmetry adaptation.

<p>Silicon-Germanium heterostructures are a promising quantum circuit platform,
but crucial aspects as the long-term charge dynamics and cooldown-to-cooldown
variations are still widely unexplored quantitatively. In this letter we
present the results of an extensive bias cooling study performed on gated
silicon-germanium quantum dots with an Al2O3-dielectric. Over 80 cooldowns were
performed in the course of our investigations. The performance of the devices
is assessed by low-frequency charge noise measurements in the band of 200 micro
Hertz to 10 milli Hertz. We measure the total noise power as a function of the
applied voltage during cooldown in four different devices and find a minimum in
noise at 0.7V bias cooling voltage for all observed samples. We manage to
decrease the total noise power median by a factor of 6 and compute a reduced
tunneling current density using Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. Furthermore,
we show the variation in noise from the same device in the course of eleven
different cooldowns performed under the nominally same conditions.

<h3>Message-Passing Interatomic Potentials Learn Non-Local Electrostatic  Interactions</h3>

</p><i>Sungwoo Kang</i>
<p>This work demonstrates that E(3)-equivariant graph neural network interatomic
potentials (GNN-IPs) effectively learn non-local electrostatic interactions and
charge transfers. Using a toy model with point charges, it is confirmed that
GNN-IPs adeptly interpolate and extrapolate electrostatic interactions,
independent of geometric coupling. It is also found that the electrostatic
energy between an atom pair is distributed among neighboring atoms, rather than
localized solely within the two atoms involved. Furthermore, GNN-IPs have
proven successful in capturing non-local interactions through charge transfer
on density functional theory reference data, as evidenced by comparative
analyses of the potential energy surfaces for Au clusters on both MgO and
Al-doped MgO substrates.

<h3>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin  density waves</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ying-Ming Xie, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<p>Recently, there has been growing interest in the impacts of phase shifts
within the triple-Q spin density wave (SDW) order parameters. Concurrently, it
is widely recognized that incommensurate triple-Q charge density waves (CDW)
are also prevalent in low-dimensional materials, where the phase degrees of
freedom in the order parameters are generally allowed. In this study, we
systematically investigate the pivotal effects arising from both triple-Q CDW
and SDW order parameters, with particular consideration given to possible phase
shifts. We show that the phase shifts play a crucial role in determining the
real-space topology of triple-Q density waves. More importantly, we show that
the triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters would influence the band geometry in
the momentum space, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced by the
triple-Q density wave order parameters near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we
explicitly establish that such nontrivial band geometry, combined with
symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing
linear and nonlinear responses.

<h3>Thermal stability and phase transformation of $α$-,  $κ(ε)$-, and $γ$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ thin films to  $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ under various ambient conditions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00299</a>
<br>
</p><i>J. Tang, K. Jiang, P. Tseng, R. C. Kurchin, L. M. Porter, R. F. Davis</i>
<p>Phase transitions in metastable $\alpha$-, $\kappa(\epsilon)$-, and
$\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films to thermodynamically stable $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
during annealing in air, N$_2$, and vacuum have been systematically
investigated via in-situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction and scanning
electron microscopy. These respective polymorphs exhibited thermal stability to
around 471-525$^\circ$C, 773-825$^\circ$C, and 490-575$^\circ$C before
transforming into $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, across all tested ambient conditions.
Particular crystallographic orientation relationships were observed before and
after the phase transitions, i.e., (0006) $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$
$(\overline{4}02)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, (004) $\kappa(\epsilon)$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
$\parallel$ (310) and $(\overline{4}02)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and (400)
$\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$ (400) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The phase
transition of $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ resulted in
catastrophic damage to the film and upheaval of the surface. The respective
primary and possibly secondary causes of this damage are the +8.6% volume
expansion and the dual displacive and reconstructive transformations that occur
during this transition. The $\kappa(\epsilon)$- and $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films
converted to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ via singular reconstructive transformations
with small changes in volume and unchanged surface microstructures.

<h3>Environment-adaptive machine learning potentials</h3>

</p><i>Ngoc Cuong Nguyen, Dionysios Sema</i>
<p>The development of interatomic potentials that can effectively capture a wide
range of atomic environments is a complex challenge due to several reasons.
Materials can exist in numerous structural forms (e.g., crystalline, amorphous,
defects, interfaces) and phases (solid, liquid, gas, plasma). Each form may
require different treatment in potential modeling to reflect the real physical
behavior correctly. Atoms interact through various forces such as
electrostatic, van der Waals, ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and metallic
bonding, which manifest differently depending on the chemical elements and
their electronic structures. Furthermore, the effective interaction among atoms
can change with external conditions like temperature, pressure, and chemical
environment. Consequently, creating an interatomic potential that performs well
across diverse conditions is difficult since optimizing the potential for one
set of conditions can lead to a trade-off in the accuracy of predicted
properties associated with other conditions. In this paper, we present a method
to construct accurate, efficient and transferable interatomic potentials by
adapting to the local atomic environment of each atom within a system. The
collection of atomic environments of interest is partitioned into several
clusters of atomic environments. Each cluster represents a distinctive local
environment and is used to define a corresponding local potential. We introduce
a many-body many-potential expansion to smoothly blend these local potentials
to ensure global continuity of the potential energy surface. This is achieved
by computing the probability functions that determine the likelihood of an atom
belonging to each cluster. We apply the environment-adaptive machine learning
potentials to predict observable properties for Ta element and InP compound,
and compare them with density functional theory calculations.

<h3>Planar Hall Effect in Quasi-Two-Dimensional Materials</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Koushik Ghorai, Sunit Das, Harsh Varshney, Amit Agarwal</i>
<p>The planar Hall effect in 3D systems is an effective probe for their Berry
curvature, topology, and electronic properties. However, the Berry
curvature-induced conventional planar Hall effect is forbidden in 2D systems as
the out-of-plane Berry curvature cannot couple to the band velocity of the
electrons moving in the 2D plane. Here, we demonstrate a unique 2D planar Hall
effect (2DPHE) originating from the hidden planar components of the Berry
curvature and orbital magnetic moment in quasi-2D materials. We identify all
planar band geometric contributions to 2DPHE and classify their crystalline
symmetry restrictions. Using gated bilayer graphene as an example, we show that
in addition to capturing the hidden band geometric effects, 2DPHE is also
sensitive to the Lifshitz transitions. Our work motivates further exploration
of hidden planar band geometry-induced 2DPHE and related transport phenomena
for innovative applications.

<h3>Low-temperature thermal transport in moiré superlattices</h3>

</p><i>Lukas P. A. Krisna, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino</i>
<p>We calculate the thermal conductivity of various moir\'e bilayer systems
using a continuum approach and the semiclassical transport theory. When the
twist angle is close to 0, we observe a significant reduction of thermal
conductivity in a particular low-temperature regime. This reduction is
attributed to a moir\'e-induced reconstruction of acoustic phonon bands and
associated decrease of the group velocity. Conversely, in the zero temperature
limit, the thermal conductivity is enhanced by moir\'e effect, surpassing the
original values in non-moir\'e counterparts. These changes result in a
characteristic temperature dependence which deviates from the quadratic
behavior in intrinsic two-dimensional systems.

<h3>Unconventional pairing in Ising superconductors: Application to  monolayer NbSe$_2$</h3>

</p><i>Subhojit Roy, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen, Shantanu Mukherjee</i>
<p>The presence of a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and in-plane mirror
symmetry allows an Ising spin-orbit coupling to form in some two-dimensional
materials. Examples include transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors
like monolayer NbSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, TaS$_2$, and PbTe$_2$, where a nontrivial
nature of the superconducting state is currently being explored. In this study,
we develop a microscopic formalism for Ising superconductors that captures the
superconducting instability arising from a momentum-dependent spin- and
charge-fluctuation-mediated pairing interaction. We apply our pairing model to
the electronic structure of monolayer NbSe$_2$, where first-principles
calculations reveal the presence of strong paramagnetic fluctuations. Our
calculations provide a quantitative measure of the mixing between the even- and
odd-parity superconducting states and its variation with Coulomb interaction.
Further, numerical analysis in the presence of an external Zeeman field reveals
the role of Ising spin-orbit coupling and mixing of odd-parity superconducting
state in influencing the low-temperature enhancement of the critical magnetic

<p>We study spontaneous photon decay into multiple photons triggered by strong
non-linearities in a superconducting quantum simulator of the boundary
sine-Gordon impurity model. Previously, spectroscopic signatures of
photon-conversion were reported and evidenced as resonances in the many-body
spectrum of these systems. Here, we report on the observation of multi-mode
fluorescence of a small Josephson junction embedded in a high impedance
superconducting transmission line. Measurement of the down-converted photons is
achieved using state-of-the-art broadband parametric amplifiers. Photon triplet
emission is explicitly demonstrated at a given frequency as the counterpart of
inelastic photon decay at three-times the emission frequency. These results
open exciting prospects for the burgeoning field of many-body quantum optics
and offer a direct signature of the ultra-strong light-matter coupling.

<h3>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the phase diagram of the two-dimensional  uniform electron liquid</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00425" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00425</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sam Azadi, N.D. Drummond, S.M. Vinko</i>
<p>We present a study of spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized two-dimensional
uniform electron liquids using variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo
(VMC and DMC) methods with Slater-Jastrow-backflow trial wave functions.
Ground-state VMC and DMC energies are obtained in the density range $1 \leq
r_\text{s} \leq 40$. Single-particle and many-body finite-size errors are
corrected using canonical-ensemble twist-averaged boundary conditions and
extrapolation of twist-averaged energies to the thermodynamic limit of infinite
system size. System-size-dependent errors in Slater-Jastrow-backflow DMC
energies caused by partially converged VMC energy minimization calculations are
discussed. We find that, for $1 \leq r_\text{s} \leq 5$, optimizing the
backflow function at each twist lowers the twist-averaged DMC energy at finite
system size. However, nonsystematic system-size-dependent effects remain in the
DMC energies, which can be partially removed by extrapolation from multiple
finite system sizes to infinite system size. We attribute these nonsystematic
effects to the close competition between fluid and defected crystal phases at
different system sizes at low density. The DMC energies in the thermodynamic
limit are used to parameterize a local spin density approximation correlation
functional for inhomogeneous electron systems. Our zero-temperature phase
diagram shows a single transition from a paramagnetic fluid to a hexagonal
Wigner crystal at $r_\text{s}=35(1)$, with no region of stability for a
ferromagnetic fluid.

<h3>Fractional domain wall statistics in spin chains with anomalous  symmetries</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00439" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00439</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jose Garre Rubio, Norbert Schuch</i>
<p>We study the statistics of domain wall excitations in quantum spin chains. We
focus on systems with finite symmetry groups represented by matrix product
unitaries (MPUs), i.e. finite depth quantum circuits. Such symmetries can be
anomalous, in which case gapped phases which they support must break the
symmetry. The lowest lying excitations of those systems are thus domain wall
excitations. We investigate the behavior of these domain walls under exchange,
and find that they can exhibit non-trivial exchange statistics. This statistics
is completely determined by the anomaly of the symmetry, and we provide a
direct relation between the known classification of MPU symmetry actions on
ground states and the domain wall statistics. Already for the simplest case of
a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, we obtain that the presence of an anomalous MPU
symmetry gives rise to domain wall excitations which behave neither as bosons
nor as fermions, but rather exhibit fractional statistics. Finally, we show
that the exchange statistics of domain walls is a physically accessible
quantity, by devising explicit measurement operators through which it can be
determined.

<p>We consider the Robin Hood dynamics, a one-dimensional extremal
self-organized critical model that describes the evolution of low-temperature
creep. One of the key quantities is the time evolution of the state variable
(force noise). To understand the temporal correlations, we compute the power
spectra of the local force fluctuations and apply finite-size scaling to get
scaling functions and critical exponents. We find a signature of the
$1/f^{\alpha}$ noise for the local force with a nontrivial value of the
spectral exponent $0< \alpha < 2$. We also examine temporal fluctuations in the
position of the extremal site and a local activity signal. We present results
for different local interaction rules of the model.

<br>
</p><i>Taro Sawada, Kazuki Sone, Kazuki Yokomizo, Yuto Ashida, Takahiro Sagawa</i>
<p>Bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle in topological
physics. In recent years, there have been considerable efforts in extending the
idea of geometry and topology to classical stochastic systems far from
equilibrium. However, it has been unknown whether or not the bulk-boundary
correspondence can be extended to the steady states of stochastic processes
accompanied by additional constraints such as the conservation of probability.
The present study reveals the general form of bulk-boundary correspondence in
classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we prove a correspondence between
the winding number and the number of localized steady states in both ergodic
and nonergodic systems. Furthermore, we extend the argument of the
bulk-boundary correspondence to a many-body stochastic model called the
asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). These results would provide a
guiding principle for exploring topological origin of localization in various
stochastic processes including biological systems.

<br>
</p><i>Thomas Gruner, Jiasheng Chen, Dongjin Jang, Jacintha Banda, Christoph Geibel, Manuel Brando, F. Malte Grosche</i>
<p>Commercial adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerators still employ the same
hydrated salts that were first introduced over 85 years ago. The inherent
limitations of these insulating magnetocalorics - poor thermal conductivity at
sub-Kelvin temperatures, low entropy density, corrosiveness - can be overcome
by a new generation of rare-earth based metallic magnetocalorics. Here, we
present the metallic magnetocaloric YbNi1.6 Sn as an attractive alternative to
conventional refrigerants. YbNi1.6Sn retains high entropy into the 100 mK
regime and avoids the noble metal constituents of alternative refrigerants.
Demagnetisation tests demonstrate that YbNi1.6Sn enables economical and durable
alternatives to traditional cooling devices for temperatures reaching below 120
mK. We find that the magnetocaloric properties of this material are facilitated
by unusually small Kondo and RKKY interactions, which position YbNi1.6Sn in the
extreme local moment limit on the generalised Kondo lattice phase diagram.

<h3>To restart, or not to restart, that is the question</h3>

<br>
</p><i>R. K. Singh</i>
<p>The mean time taken by a Brownian particle to cover a distance $L$ is
$L^2/2D$, with $D$ being its diffusion coefficient. We find that restarts
increase this mean time. This is because restarts naturally introduce time
overheads which need to be taken into account while addressing the escape
properties. In addition, restarts impose a constraint on allowed overhead
functions if they are to provide an advantage, that is, a reduced mean escape
time. We explicitly study these constraints for Poisson and sharp restarts.
Implementing an overhead function to control escape times means that the
physical properties of the Brownian particle need to be appropriately modified.
When restarts are non-instantaneous, an additional delay is introduced
increasing the mean escape time further. Can restarts overcome the delays
incurred due to finite return times? To restart, or not to restart, should be
the question.

<h3>Beyond the random phase approximation for calculating Curie temperatures  in ferromagnets: application to Fe, Ni, Co and monolayer CrI3</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00477" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00477</a>
<br>
</p><i>Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thorbjørn Skovhus, Thomas Olsen</i>
<p>The magnetic properties of solids are typically analyzed in terms of
Heisenberg models where the electronic structure is approximated by interacting
localized spins. However, even in such models the evaluation of thermodynamic
properties constitutes a major challenge and is usually handled by a mean field
decoupling scheme. The random phase approximation (RPA) comprises a common
approach and is often applied to evaluate critical temperatures although it is
well known that the method is only accurate well below the critical
temperature. In the present work we compare the performance of the RPA with a
different decoupling scheme proposed by Callen as well as the mean field
decoupling of interacting Holstein-Primakoff (HP) magnons. We consider
three-dimensional (3D) as well as two-dimensional (2D) model systems where the
Curie temperature is governed by anisotropy. In 3D, the Callen method is the
most accurate in the classical limit, and we show that the Callen decoupling
produces the best agreement with experiments for bcc Fe, fcc Ni and fcc Co with
exchange interactions obtained from first principles. In contrast, for low spin
systems where a quantum mechanical treatment in pertinent, the HP and RPA
methods appear are superior to the Callen decoupling. In 2D systems with
magnetic order driven by single-ion anisotropy, it is shown that HP fails
rather dramatically and both RPA and Callen approaches severely overestimates
Curie temperatures. The most accurate approach is then constructed by combining
RPA with the Callen decoupling of single-ion anisotropy, which yields the
correct lack of order for S=1/2. We exemplify this by the case of monolayer
CrI3 using exchange constant extracted from experiments.

<h3>Recoverable strain from reverse plasticity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00487" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00487</a>
<br>
</p><i>Henry A. Lockwood, Suzanne M. Fielding</i>
<p>Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a
body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date,
the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains
stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is
removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to
irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically recoverable and
unrecoverable strain within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing
the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We
consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held
constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery
is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature,
consistent with the usual intuition, we find that significant subsequent strain
recovery then arises not via further recoil of elasticity but instead by
`reverse plasticity', in a sense that we discuss carefully. Also unexpectedly,
although in rare parameter regimes, this plastic part of the strain post
switch-off does not always in fact recover in the negative direction, counter
to that of the previously imposed stress, but can sometimes continue to
accumulate in the forward direction. The recovery is then non-monotonic
overall, reminiscent of recent observations of non-monotonic stress relaxation
after straining, which have been attributed to complex material memory effects.
We elucidate the mechanisms underlying these behaviours in terms of the
evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements, and suggest
connections with the notion of `reversible plasticity', as discussed in the
recent physics literature.

<h3>Hyperuniformity in phase ordering: the roles of activity, noise, and  non-constant mobility</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00508" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00508</a>
<br>
</p><i>Filippo De Luca, Xiao Ma, Cesare Nardini, Michael E. Cates</i>
<p>Hyperuniformity emerges generically in the coarsening regime of
phase-separating fluids. Numerical studies of active and passive systems have
shown that the structure factor $S(q)$ behaves as $q^\varsigma$ for $q\to 0$,
with hyperuniformity exponent $\varsigma = 4$. For passive systems, this result
was explained in 1991 by a qualitative scaling analysis of Tomita, exploiting
isotropy at scales much larger than the coarsening length $\ell$. Here we
reconsider and extend Tomita's argument to address cases of active phase
separation and of non-constant mobility, again finding $\varsigma=4$. We
further show that dynamical noise of variance $D$ creates a transient
$\varsigma = 2$ regime for $\hat q\ll \hat{q}_\ast \sim \sqrt{D}
t^{[1-(d+2)\nu]/2}$, crossing over to $\varsigma = 4$ at larger $\hat{q}$.
Here, $\nu$ is the coarsening exponent, with $\ell\sim t^\nu$, and $\hat{q}
\propto q \ell$ is the rescaled wavenumber. In diffusive coarsening, $\nu=1/3$,
so the rescaled crossover wavevector $\hat{q}_\ast$ vanishes at large times
when $d\geq 2$. The slowness of this decay suggests a natural explanation for
experiments that observe a long-lived $\varsigma = 2$ scaling in
phase-separating active fluids (where noise is typically large). Conversely, in
$d=1$, we demonstrate that with noise the $\varsigma = 2$ regime survives as
$t\to\infty$, with $\hat{q}_\ast\sim D^{5/6}$. (The structure factor is not
then determined by the zero-temperature fixed point.) We confirm our analytical
predictions by numerical simulations of active and passive continuum theories
in the deterministic case and of Model B for the stochastic case. We also
compare them with related findings for a system near an absorbing-state
transition rather than undergoing phase separation. A central role is played
throughout by the presence or absence of a conservation law for the centre of
mass position of the order parameter field.

<h3>Contrasting Irradiation Behavior of Dual Phases in Ti-6Al-4V Alloy at  Low-Temperature Due to Omega-phase Precursors in Beta-phase Matrix</h3>

</p><i>Taku Ishida, Sho Kano, Eiichi Wakai, Tamaki Shibayama, Shunsuke Makimura, Hiroaki Abe</i>
<p>Aiming to simulate the radiation damage effect on a dual alpha+beta phase
Ti-6Al-4V alloy utilized as high-intensity accelerator beam window material, a
series of irradiation experiments were conducted with a 2.8 MeV-Fe^2+ ion beam
in several dpa regions at room temperature. The nano-indentation hardness
increased steeply at 1 dpa and unchanged up to 10 dpa, due to the saturation of
defect clusters and tangled dislocations in the dominant alpha-phase matrix
with a size of 2~3 nm and a density of about 1x10^23 m^-3. In contrast in the
intergranular beta-phase, larger loops of 20~30 nm diameter were observed with
much less density of about 5x10^20 m^-3. The diffraction pattern showed
rectilinear diffuse streaks between the beta-phase reflections, corresponding
to the omega-phase precursor, without dose dependency in its intensity.
FFT/I-FFT analysis of the HREM revealed a sub-nanometer-sized lattice disorder
with local fluctuations, not discrete but continuous, and homogeneously
distributed within the matrix beta-phase stably against the irradiation. The
significantly low dislocation density and the absence of phase transformation
in the beta-phase matrix could be attributed either to the strong sink effect
expected for this distinctive sub-nanometer-sized homogeneous lattice disorder
or to the anomalous point defect recombination induced by the high mobility of
vacancies, both of which are originated from the metastable omega-phase
precursors specifically formed in the beta(BCC) phase of group-4 transition
metals.

<h3>Non-Abelian line graph: A generalized approach to flat bands</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Rui-Heng Liu, Xin Liu</i>
<p>Line graph (LG) lattices are well known to host flat bands (FBs) with
isotropic hoppings in $s$-orbital models. Yet, higher-angular-momentum orbitals
with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which are more common in real materials, lack a
general approach for their inclusion in LG to achieve FBs. Here, we introduce a
non-Abelian LG theory to construct FBs in realistic systems, which incorporates
internal degrees of freedom and goes beyond real-valued isotropic hoppings. The
lattice edges and sites in the LG are modified to be associated with arbitrary
Hermitian matrices, refereed to as multiple LG. A crucial step is to map the
multiple LG Hamiltonian to a tight-binding (TB) model that respects the lattice
symmetry through appropriate local non-Abelian transformations in the internal
space. We find the general conditions to determine the local transformation.
Based on this mechanism, we discuss the realization of $d$-orbital FBs in the
Kagome lattice, which may serve as a minimal model for understanding the
high-orbital FBs with SOC in Kagome materials. Our approach bridges the known
FBs in pure lattice models and the realization in multi-orbital systems.

<p>Despite many reports of valley-related phenomena in graphene and its

without the application of external fields. Here we propose a gate-defined
valley splitter as a direct transport probe for valley phenomenon in graphene
multilayers. First, we show how the device works, its magnetotransport
response, and its robustness against fabrication errors. Secondly, we present
two applications for valley splitters: (i) resonant tunneling of quantum dots
probed by a valley splitter shows the valley polarization of dot levels; (ii) a
combination of two valley splitters resolves the nature of order parameters in
mesoscopic samples.

<h3>Spin-spin correlators on the $β$/$β^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D  Ising-like models: non-universality in the scaling region</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yizhuang Liu</i>
<p>In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions
on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$
and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without
reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are
usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are
normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$-blocked) versions.
Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries
considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative
Wiener-Hopf factorizations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$
do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, "logarithmic
divergences" and non-universal short distance contributions in the Wiener-Hopf
factors fail to factorize out completely in the re-scaled correlators. This
leads to non-universality of the leading large $r$ asymptotics at the order
$\frac {e^{-r}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, even when the constant terms are re-scaled
to be the same.

<h3>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jordan L. Shivers, Fred C. MacKintosh</i>
<p>Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction
along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these
strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases
or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched.
However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically
highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees
a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume
reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain
axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's
modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity
governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by
the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which
produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching
and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and
elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in
experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the
nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence
of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response,
including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.

</p><i>Anshu Thapa, Robert Malinowski, Matthew O. Blunt, Giorgio Volpe, Joe Forth</i>
<p>Capillary forces guide the motion of biomolecular condensates, water-borne
insects, and breakfast cereal. These surface-mediated interactions can be
harnessed to build units into materials with exotic properties deriving from
mesoscale structure. Droplets are promising building blocks for these
materials, finding applications in tissue engineering, adaptive optics, and
structural colour. However, the instability of water droplets at many
liquid-liquid interfaces hampers the use of capillarity for the assembly of
droplet-based materials. Here, we use nanoparticle surfactants to form
solid-like oil-water interfaces at which aqueous droplets sit for extended
periods. We find that microlitre-sized droplets at these interfaces attract
each other over millimetric scales. We rationalize this interaction with a
modified theory of capillarity. Applying printing methods allows us to finely
control initial droplet positions, from which they self-assemble into cellular
materials. Finally, by functionalising the interface with gold nanoparticles,
we use plasmon-assisted optofluidics to manipulate these droplet-based
materials with temperature gradients.

<h3>Metamagnetism and anomalous magnetotransport properties in  rare-earth-based polar semimetals $R$AuGe ($R =$ Dy, Ho, and Gd)</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Takashi Kurumaji, Masaki Gen, Shunsuke Kitou, Taka-hisa Arima</i>
<p>We report the magnetic, magnetoelastic, and magnetotransport properties of
single crystals of polar magnets $R$AuGe ($R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd), grown by Au-Ge
self-flux. Magnetization and magnetostriction measurements reveal multi-step
metamagnetic transitions for the $c$-axis magnetic field ($H\parallel c$) for
DyAuGe and HoAuGe, suggesting magnetic frustration in the triangular lattice of
$R$ ions. The magnetic phase diagrams have clarified a close connection between
the magnetoelastic property and the emergence of the intermediate metamagentic
phase. The magnetic-field dependence of the resistivity and Hall resistivity
reveal the semimetallic transport dominated by hole-type carriers, consistent
with the behavior in a nonmagnetic analogue YAuGe. We also identify a signature
of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) proportional to the field-induced
magnetization in $R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd. GdAuGe shows magnetic and transport
behavior as reported in a previous study using Bi-flux grown single crystals,
while the self-flux grown crystal shows larger magnetoresistance ($\sim$ 345\%,
at 1.8 K and 9 T) due to higher hole-type carrier mobility ($\sim$ 6400
cm$^2$/Vs). Using the two-band model analysis considering the mobility change
during the magnetization process, we extract the anomalous Hall conductivity:
$\sim 1200$ S/cm and $\sim 530$ S/cm for $R=$ Dy and Ho, respectively, at 1.8 K
with 9 T for $H\parallel c$. The magnitude of conductivity suggests a
contribution of intrinsic origin, possibly related to the Berry curvature in
the electron bands induced by the time-reversal symmetry breaking and the polar
lattice.

<h3>Vacancy-mediated transport and segregation tendencies of solutes in FCC  nickel under diffusional creep: A density functional theory study</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shehab Shousha, Sourabh Bhagwan Kadambi, Benjamin Beeler, Boopathy Kombaiah</i>
<p>The Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional creep theory postulates the
vacancy-mediated transport of atoms under a stress gradient as the creep
mechanism under low-stress and high-temperature conditions. In multicomponent
alloys, we premise that this stress-assisted flow of vacancies to and from
grain boundaries will produce elemental segregation. An observation of such
segregation, validated with theoretical predictions, can provide the necessary
experimental evidence for the occurrence of N-H creep. Theoretical calculations
of the segregation tendencies via analyzing the dominant solute diffusion
mechanisms and the difference in diffusivities of the elements are therefore
essential. To this end, this study applies density functional theory
calculations of migration barriers and solute-vacancy binding energies as input
to the self-consistent mean field theory to assess the vacancy-mediated
diffusion mechanisms, transport coefficients, and segregation tendencies of Co,
Cr, Mo, Re, Ta, and W solutes in face-centered cubic Ni. We find Co, Re, and W
to be slow diffusers at high temperatures and Cr, Mo, and Ta to be fast
diffusers. Further analysis shows that the slow diffusers tend to always enrich
at vacancy sinks over a wide range of temperatures. In contrast, the fast
diffusers show a transition from depletion to enrichment as the temperature
lowers. Furthermore, our analysis of the segregation tendencies under tensile
hydrostatic strains shows that slow diffusers are largely unaffected by the
strain and favor enrichment. On the other hand, the fast diffusers exhibit high
sensitivity to strain and their segregation tendency can transition from
depletion to enrichment at a given temperature. The transport coefficients
calculated in this work are expected to serve as input to mesoscale
microstructure models to provide a more rigorous assessment of solute
segregation under N-H creep conditions.

<p>Accurate prediction of electronic and optical excitations in van der Waals
(vdW) materials is a long-standing challenge for density functional theory. The
recently proposed Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated
hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional has proven successful in non-empirical
determination of electronic band gaps and optical absorption spectra for
various covalent and ionic crystals. However, for vdW materials the tuning of
the material- and structure-dependent functional parameters has, until now,
only been attained semi-empirically. Here, we present a non-empirical WOT-SRSH
approach applicable to vdW materials, with the optimal functional parameters
transferable between monolayer and bulk. We apply this methodology to
prototypical vdW materials: black phosphorus, molybdenum disulfide, and
hexagonal boron nitride (in the latter case including zero-point
renormalization). We show that the WOT-SRSH approach consistently achieves
accuracy levels comparable to experiments and ab initio many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) calculations for band structures and optical absorption spectra,
both on its own and as an optimal starting point for MBPT calculations.

<p>Cylindrical magnetic nanowires have been proposed as a means of storing and
processing information in a 3D medium, based on the motion of domain
walls~(DWs). Introducing short chemical modulations in such wires would allow
for reliable digital control of DWs. Here, we outline the intricate physics of
the interaction of domain walls with modulations to control their motion,
combining micromagnetic simulations and experimental evidence. This interaction
combines a long-range moderate magnetostatic repulsion with a local energy
well. The latter depends on the respective circulation sense of magnetization
in the domain wall and modulation. We also show that a modulation has the
ability to switch the internal circulation of a DW upon its propagation,
thereby acting as a polarizing component and opening the possibility to exploit
not only the position of walls, but also their internal structure.

<p>The bulk dynamics of dense granular materials arise through a combination of
particle-scale and mesoscale effects. Theoretical and numerical studies have
shown that collective effects are created by particle-scale anisotropic
structures such as grain connectivity (fabric), force transmission, and
frictional mobilization, all of which influence bulk properties like bulk
friction and the stress tensor through the Stress-Force-Fabric (SFF)
relationship. To date, establishing the relevance of these effects to
laboratory systems has remained elusive due to the challenge of measuring both
normal and frictional contact forces at the particle scale. In this study, we
perform experiments on a sheared photoelastic granular system in an quasi-2D
annular (Couette) cell. During these experiments, we measure particle
locations, contacts, and normal and frictional forces vectors during loading.
We reconstruct the angular distributions of the contact and force vectors, and
extract the corresponding emergent anisotropies for each of these metrics.
Finally, we show that the SFF relation quantitatively predicts the relationship
between particle scale anisotropies, the stress tensor components, and the bulk
friction coefficient, capturing even transient behaviors. As such, this method
shows promise for application to other dense particulate systems where fabric
anisotropy can provide a useful measure of bulk friction.
