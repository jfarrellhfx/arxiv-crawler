<h3>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Vortex Number in Binary Superfluid AC  Counterflow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03418" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03418</a>

<br>
In binary superfluid counterflow systems, vortex nucleation arises as a
consequence of hydrodynamic instabilities when the coupling coefficient and
counterflow velocity exceed critical value. When dealing with two identical
components, one might naturally anticipate that the number of vortices
generated would remain equal. However, our investigation has unveiled a
remarkable phenomenon: in AC counterflow systems, once the coupling coefficient
and frequency exceed certain critical values, a surprising symmetry-breaking
phenomenon occurs. This results in an asymmetry in the number of vortices in
the two components. We establish that this phenomenon represents a novel
continuous phase transition, which, as indicated by the phase diagram, is
exclusively observable in AC counterflow. We provide an explanation for this
intriguing phenomenon through soliton structures, thus shedding light on the
intricate and distinct characteristics of quantum fluid instability and its
rich spectrum of phenomena.

Conventional hydrodynamics describes systems with few long-lived excitations.
In one dimension, however, many experimentally relevant systems feature a large
number of long-lived excitations even at high temperature, because they are
proximate to integrable limits. Such models cannot be treated using
conventional hydrodynamics. The framework of generalized hydrodynamics (GHD)
was recently developed to treat the dynamics of one-dimensional models: it
combines ideas from integrability, hydrodynamics, and kinetic theory to come up
with a quantitative theory of transport. GHD has successfully settled several
longstanding questions about one-dimensional transport; it has also been
leveraged to study dynamical questions beyond the transport of conserved
quantities, and to systems that are not integrable. In this article we
introduce the main ideas and predictions of GHD, survey some of the most recent
theoretical extensions and experimental tests of the GHD framework, and discuss
some open questions in transport that the GHD perspective might elucidate.

We extend the kinetic operator formalism developed in the companion paper
[H.Guo,XXX] to study the general eigenvalues of the fluctuation normal modes.
We apply the formalism to calculate the optical conductivity of a critical
Fermi surface near the Ising-Nematic quantum critical point. We find that the
conductivity is the sum of multiple conduction channels including both the soft
and non-soft eigenvectors of the kinetic operator, and therefore it is not
appropriate to interpret the optical conductivity using extended Drude formula
for momentum conserved systems. We also show that the propagation of the FS
soft modes is governed by a Boltzmann equation from which hydrodynamics
emerges. We calculate the viscosity and it shows clear signature of the
non-Fermi liquid physics.

The strong coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity was found in rare
earth manganites, in which the electric polarization can be induced by special
magnetic ordering. We develop a ferroelectricity theory in multiferroics with
antisymmetric exchange interaction within the framework of many-particle
quantum hydrodynamics. It is applied for the study of clusters of magnetic
ions, where the electric dipole moment can be induced as a result of spin-orbit
coupling. Our approach is based on the many-particle Pauli equation, where the
influence of an external magnetic field is taken into consideration via the
Zeeman energy. A general model is formulated for the description of the
polarization dynamics. We consider the polarization switching in ferroelectric
magnets with the spiral spin-density-wave state, and demonstrate that the
proposed model yields predictable results. The dynamic magnetoelectric effect
can be studied by making use of the novel equation for the evolution of
polarization.

<h3>Goldilocks fluctuations: dynamic constraints on loop formation in  scale-free transport networks</h3>

<br>

Adaptive transport networks are known to contain loops when subject to
hydrodynamic fluctuations. However, fluctuations are no guarantee that a loop
will form, as shown by loop-free networks driven by oscillating flows. We
provide a complete stability analysis of the dynamical behaviour of any loop
formed by fluctuating flows. We find a threshold for loop stability that
involves an interplay of geometric constraints and hydrodynamic forcing mapped
to constant and fluctuating components. Loops require fluctuation in the
relative size of the flux between nodes, not just a temporal variation in the
flux at a given node. Hence, there is both a minimum and a maximum amount of
fluctuation relative to the constant-flux component where loops are supported.

<h3>Precision Measurement of Sub-Continuum Gas Conduction within  Micro-Confinements</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sub-continuum gas conduction is an essentially important phenomenon in
disparate fields of applications ranging from aerospace vehicles to biomedical
sensors, and has been the focus of many computational studies over the past
decades. These studies predicted that the energy exchange mechanisms are driven
by gas-surface interactions, strongly dependent on the gas and surface
characteristics. Despite its fundamental and practical importance, thermal
transport via gas conduction at non-continuum regimes mostly remains
experimentally unverified. Here, we report precision measurements of
sub-continuum gas conduction within parallel micro-cavities and elucidate its
dependence on the gas and surface characteristics. More importantly, we
demonstrate a systematic approach for extracting the energy accommodation
coefficient (EAC), which is necessary to establish gas-surface scattering
kernels or develop diffusive-specular solutions to the Boltzmann transport
equation. EACs are also required for calculating the temperature jump
coefficient in near-continuum conditions to solve classical hydrodynamical
equations. For the first time, we show a correction to the kinetic theory in
the transition to near-continuum regimes (particularly for non-monatomic gases)
by extracting a physical parameter representing the intermolecular collisions
within the Knudsen layer. Our results agree well with the kinetic theory
predictions and are expected to inform the development of technologies such as
thermal switches, gas sensors, and light-driven actuators.

<h3>Signatures of hidden octupolar order from nonlinear Hall effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03435" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03435</a>
<br>
<i>Sopheak Sorn, Adarsh S. Patri</i>

Detecting symmetry-breaking hidden orders with conventional probes has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of magnetism. Higher-rank multipolar
ordering $-$ anisotropic charge and magnetization distributions arising from a
combination of spin-orbit coupling and crystalline environments $-$ is a
quintessential example of such hidden orders, where new protocols of direct
detection remain highly desirable. In this work, we propose non-linear Hall
effects as a novel probe for multipolar ordering in metallic systems. Taking
inspiration from the family of Pr-based heavy-fermion compounds,
Pr(Ti,V)$_2$Al$_{20}$, we formulate a minimal cubic-lattice model of conduction
electrons coupled to a ferro-octupolar order parameter. The
time-reversal-breaking order leads to a band structure that supports strong
quadrupolar moments of the Berry curvature (BC). Using a semi-classical
Boltzmann formalism in conjunction with a symmetry analysis, we demonstrate
that the BC quadrupoles produce a third harmonic generation of the Hall voltage
$[V_H(3 \omega)]$ measurable in an AC Hall experiment. Properties of the Hall
response such as its anisotropy, its dissipationlessness, and its dependence on
the order parameter are also examined. Our work encourages a new realm of
investigation of multipolar ordering from non-linear transport experiments.

<h3>Topology of SmB6 revisited by means of topological quantum chemistry</h3>

The mixed-valence compound SmB6 with partially filled samarium 4f flat bands
hybridizing with 5d conduction bands is a paramount example of a correlated
topological heavy-fermion system. In this study we revisit the topology of SmB6
with the band theory paradigm and uncover previously overlooked aspects
resulting from the formation of multiple topological gaps in the electronic
structure. By invoking topological quantum chemistry (TQC) we provide a
detailed classification of the strong and crystalline topological features that
derive from the existence of such topological gaps. To corroborate this
classification, we calculate Wilson loops and simulate the surface electronic
structure using a minimal tight-binding model, allowing us to describe its
surface states and confirm the crystalline topology. We finally discuss its
implications for experiments.

Remarkable recent experiments on the moir\'e structure formed by pentalayer
rhombohedral graphene aligned with a hexagonal Boron-Nitride substrate report
the discovery of a zero field fractional quantum hall effect. These
``Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall'' (FQAH) phases occur for one sign of a
perpendicular displacement field, and correspond, experimentally, to full or
partial filling of a valley polarized Chern-$1$ band. Here we present
microscopic theoretical calculations demonstrating the emergence of a Chern-$1$
band and the FQAH phases in this system. We also study the four and six-layer
analogs and identify parameters where a nearly flat isolated Chern-$1$ band
emerges which may be suitable to host FQAH physics.

<h3>An integral algorithm of exponential observables for interacting  fermions in quantum Monte Carlo simulation</h3>

Exponential observables, formulated as $\log \langle e^{\hat{X}}\rangle$
where $\hat{X}$ is an extensive quantity, play a critical role in study of
quantum many-body systems, examples of which include the free-energy and
entanglement entropy. Given that $e^{X}$ becomes exponentially large (or small)
in the thermodynamic limit, accurately computing the expectation value of this
exponential quantity presents a significant challenge. In this Letter, we
propose a comprehensive algorithm for quantifying these observables in
interacting fermion systems, utilizing the determinant quantum Monte Carlo
(DQMC) method. We have applied this novel algorithm to the 2D half-filled
Hubbard model. At the strong coupling limit, our method showcases a significant
accuracy improvement compared to conventional methods that are derived from the
internal energy. We also illustrate that this novel approach delivers highly
efficient and precise measurements of the nth R\'enyi entanglement entropy.
Even more noteworthy is that this improvement comes without incurring increases
in computational complexity. This algorithm effectively suppresses exponential
fluctuations and can be easily generalized to other models.

<h3>A symmetry-based protocol to benchmark quantum simulation of many-body  physics</h3>

Quantum simulation of many-body systems, particularly using ultracold atoms
and trapped ions, presents a unique form of quantum control -- it is a direct
implementation of a multi-qubit gate generated by the Hamiltonian. As a
consequence, it also faces a unique challenge in terms of benchmarking, because
the well-established gate benchmarking techniques are unsuitable for this form
of quantum control. Here we show that the symmetries of the target many-body
Hamiltonian can be used to benchmark and even characterize experimental errors
in the quantum simulation. We consider two forms of errors: (i) unitary errors
arising out of systematic errors in the applied Hamiltonian and (ii) canonical
non-Markovian errors arising out of random shot-to-shot fluctuations in the
applied Hamiltonian. We show that the dynamics of the expectation value of the
target Hamiltonian itself, which is ideally constant in time, can be used to
characterize these errors. In the presence of errors, the expectation value of
the target Hamiltonian shows a characteristic thermalization dynamics, when it
satisfies the operator thermalization hypothesis (OTH). That is, an oscillation
in the short time followed by relaxation to a steady-state value in the long
time limit. We show that while the steady-state value can be used to
characterize the coherent errors, the amplitude of the oscillations can be used
to estimate the non-Markovian errors. We develop two experimental protocols to
characterize the unitary errors based on these results, one of which requires
single-qubit addressing and the other one doesn't. We also develop a protocol
to detect and partially characterize non-Markovian errors.

<h3>Is the Migdal-Eliashberg Theory for 2+1D Critical Fermi Surface Stable?</h3>

<i>Haoyu Guo</i>

We diagnose the stability of the Migdal-Eliashberg theory for a Fermi surface
coupled to a gapless boson in 2+1 dimensions. We provide a scheme for
diagonalizing the Bethe-Salpeter ladder when small-angle scattering mediated by
the boson plays a dominant role. We found a large number of soft modes which
correspond to shape fluctuations of the Fermi surface, and these shape
deformations follow a diffusion-like dynamics on the Fermi surface.
Surprisingly, the odd-parity deformations of a convex Fermi surface becomes
unstable near the non-Fermi liquid regime of the Ising-Nematic quantum critical
point and our finding calls for revisit of the Migdal-Eliashberg framework. The
implication of the Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalues in transport will be discussed in
the companion paper [H.Guo,XXX].

<h3>Effects of dilution in a 2D topological magnon insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03457" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03457</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel S. Oliveira, T. V. C. Antão, Eduardo V. Castro, Nuno Peres</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effect of diluting a two-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator
hosting a topological phase in the clean limit. By considering the
ferromagnetic Heisenberg model in the honeycomb lattice with second
nearest-neighbor Dzyanshikii-Moriya interaction, and working in the linear
spin-wave approximation, we establish the topological phase diagram as a
function of the fraction $p$ of diluted magnetic atoms. The topological phase
with Chern number $C=1$ is robust up to a moderate dilution $p_{1}^{*}$, while
above a higher dilution $p_{2}^{*}>p_{1}^{*}$ the system becomes trivial.
Interestingly, both $p_{1}^{*}$ and $p_{2}^{*}$ are below the classical
percolation threshold $p_{c}$ for the honeycomb lattice, which gives physical
significance to the obtained phases. In the topological phase for
$p<p_{1}^{*}$, the magnon spectrum is gapless but the states filling the
topological, clean-limit gap region are spatially localized. For energies above
and below the region of localized states, there are windows composed of
extended states. This is at odds with standard Chern insulators, where extended
states occur only at single energies. For dilutions $p_{1}^{*}<p<p_{2}^{*}$,
the two regions of extended states merge and a continuum of delocalized states
appears around the middle of the magnon spectrum. For this range of dilutions
the Chern number seems to be ill defined in the thermodynamic limit, and only
for $p>p_{2}^{*}$, when all states become localized, the system shows $C=0$ as
expected for a trivial phase. Replacing magnetic with non-magnetic atoms in a
systems hosting a magnon Chern insulator in the clean limit puts all the three
phases within experimental reach.

<h3>Homogeneous crystallization in four-dimensional Lennard-Jones liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03465" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03465</a>
<br>
<i>Robert S. Hoy</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the first observation of homogeneous crystallization in simulated
high-dimensional ($d > 3$) liquids that follow physically realistic dynamics
and have system sizes that are large enough to eliminate the possibility that
crystallization was induced by the periodic boundary conditions. Supercooled
four-dimensional (4D) Lennard-Jones liquids maintained at zero pressure and
constant temperatures $0.59 < T < 0.63$ crystallized within $\sim 2 \times
10^4\tau$, where $\tau$ is the LJ time unit. WCA liquids that were maintained
at the same densities and temperatures at which their LJ counterparts nucleated
did not crystallize even after $2.5\times 10^5\tau$, showing that the presence
of long-ranged attractive interactions dramatically speeds up 4D
crystallization, much as it does in 3D. However, the overlap of the liquid and
crystalline phases' local-bond-order distributions is much smaller for LJ than
for WCA systems, which is the opposite of the 3D trend. This implies that the
widely accepted hypothesis that increasing geometrical frustration rapidly
suppresses crystallization as the spatial dimension $d$ increases is only
generally valid in the absence of attractive interparticle forces.

<h3>Spatial Correlation at the Boson Peak Frequency in Amorphous Materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Boson peak (BP), an excess of vibrational density of states, is
ubiquitous for amorphous materials and is believed to hold the key to
understanding the dynamics of glass and glass transition. Previous studies have
established an energy scale for the BP, which is ~1-10 meV or ~THz in
frequency. However, so far, little is known about the momentum dependence or
spatial correlation of the BP. Here, we report the observation of the BP in
model Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses over a wide range of momentum transfer, using
inelastic neutron scattering, heat capacity, Raman scattering measurements, and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The BP energy is largely dispersionless;
however, the BP intensity was found to scale with the static structure factor.
Additional MD simulations with a generic Lennard-Jones potential confirmed the
same. Based on these results, an analytical expression for the dynamic
structure factor was formulated for the BP excitation. Further analysis of the
simulated disordered structures suggests that the BP is related to local
structure fluctuations (e.g., in shear strain). Our results offered insights
into the nature of the BP and provide guidance for the development of theories
of amorphous materials.

<h3>An exciton interacting with a moire lattice -- polarons, strings, and  optical probing of spin correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03482" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03482</a>
<br>
<i>Aleksi Julku, Shanshan Ding, Georg M. Bruun</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a general theory for how an exciton in an atomically thin
transition metal dichacogenide (TMD) monolayer couples to spin and charge
correlations in an adjacent moire lattice created by a TMD bi-layer. Virtual
tunneling of charge carriers, assumed for concreteness to be holes, between the
moire lattice and the monolayer combined with the presence of bound
hole-exciton states, i.e. trions, give rise to an effective interaction between
the moire holes and the exciton. In addition to the Umklapp scattering, we show
that this interaction is spin-dependent and therefore couples the exciton to
the spin correlations of the moire holes, which may be in- as well as
out-of-plane. We then use our theory to examine two specific examples where the
moire holes form in-plane ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic order. In both
cases, the exciton creates spin waves in the moire lattice, which we analyse by
using a self-consistent Born approximation that includes such processes to
infinite order. We show that the competition between magnetic order and exciton
motion leads to the formation of a well-defined quasiparticle consisting of the
exciton surrounded by a cloud of magnetic frustration in the moire lattice
sites below. For the anti-ferromagnet, we furthermore demonstrate the presence
of the elusive geometric string excitations and discuss how they can be
observed via their smoking gun energy dependence on the spin-spin coupling,
which can be tuned by varying the twist angle of the moire bi-layer. All these
phenomena have clear signatures in the exciton spectrum, and as such our
results illustrate that excitons are promising probes providing optical access
to the spin correlations of new quantum phases predicted to exist in TMD
materials.

<h3>Dimensionality crossover to 2D vestigial nematicity from 3D zigzag  antiferromagnetism in an XY-type honeycomb van der Waals magnet</h3>

Fluctuations and disorder effects are substantially enhanced in reduced
dimensionalities. While they are mostly considered as the foe for long-range
orders, fluctuations and disorders can also stimulate the emergence of novel
phases of matter, for example, vestigial orders. Taking 2D magnetism as a
platform, existing efforts have been focused on maintaining 2D long-range
magnetic orders by suppressing fluctuations, whereas the other side, exploiting
fluctuations for realizing new 2D magnetic phases, remains as an uncharted
territory. Here, using a combination of NV spin relaxometry, optical
spectroscopy, and Monte Carlo simulations, we report, in an XY-type honeycomb
magnet NiPS3, the phase transition from the zigzag AFM order in 3D bulk to a
new Z3 vestigial Potts-nematicity in 2D few layers. Spin fluctuations are shown
to significantly enhance over the GHz-THz range as the layer number of NiPS3
reduces, using the NV spin relaxometry and the optical Raman quasi-elastic
scattering. As a result, the Raman signatures of the zigzag AFM for bulk NiPS3,
a zone-folded phonon at ~30cm-1 from the broken translational symmetry (PBTS)
and a degeneracy lift of two phonons at ~180cm-1 for the broken 3-fold
rotational symmetry (PBRS), evolve into the disappearance of PBTS and the
survival of PBRS in few-layer NiPS3, with a critical thickness of ~10nm. The
optical linear dichroism microscopy images all three nematic domain states in a
single few-layer NiPS3 flake. The large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for
bilayer NiPS3 model confirms the absence of long-range zigzag AFM order but the
formation of the Z3 vestigial Potts-nematic phase, corroborating with the
experimental finding. Our results demonstrate the positivity of strong
fluctuations in creating new phases of matter after destroying more
conventional ones, and offer an unprecedented pathway for developing novel 2D
phases.

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnetism within atomically thin
structures derived from layered crystals has opened up a new realm for
exploring magnetic heterostructures. This emerging field provides a
foundational platform for investigating unique physical properties and
exquisite phenomena at the nanometer and molecular/atomic scales. By
engineering 2D interfaces using physical methods and selecting interlayer
interactions, we unlock the potential for extraordinary exchange dynamics. This
potential extends to high-performance and high-density magnetic memory
applications, as well as future advancements in neuromorphic and quantum
computing. This review delves into recent advances in 2D magnets, elucidates
the mechanisms behind 2D interfaces, and highlights the development of 2D
devices for spintronics and quantum information. Particular focus is placed on
2D magnetic heterostructures with topological properties, promising for a
resilient and low-error information system. Finally, we discuss the trends of
2D heterostructures for future electronics, considering the challenges and
opportunities from physics, material synthesis, and technological prospective.

correlations of the debris left behind after avalanches are destroyed by
re-arranging particles on the lattice between avalanches, without changing the
one-point particle density. It is found that the spatial correlations are not
relevant to small avalanches, while changing the scaling of the large
(system-wide) ones, yielding a crossover in the model's scaling behaviour. This
crossover breaks the simple scaling observed in normal SOC.

In magnetic insulators, the sense of rotation of the magnetization is
associated with novel phases of matter and exotic transport phenomena. Aimed to
find new sources of chiral magnetism rooted in intrinsic fields and geometry,
we study twisted square bilayers of magnetic dipoles with easy plane
anisotropy. For no twist, each lattice settles in the antiferromagnetic zig-zag
magnetic state and orders antiferromagnetically to the other layer. The moire
patterns that result from the mutual rotation of the two square lattices
influence such zig-zag order, giving rise to several magnetic phases that
depict non-collinear magnetic textures with chiral motifs that break both time
and inversion symmetry. For certain moire angles, helical and toroidal magnetic
orders arise. These novel phases can be further manipulated by changing the
vertical distance between layers. We show that the dipolar interlayer
interaction originates an emergent twist-dependent chiral magnetic field
orthogonal to the direction of the zig-zag chains, which is responsible for the
internal torques conjugated to the toroidal orders.

Many ionic surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) crystallize out
of solution if the temperature falls below the crystallization boundary. The
crystallization temperature is impacted by solution properties, and can be
decreased with the addition of salt. We have studied SDS crystallization a t
the liquid/vapor interfaces from solutions at high ionic strength (sodium
chloride). We show that the surfactant crystals at the surface grow from
adsorbed SDS molecules, as evidenced by the preferential orientation of the
crystals identified using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. We find a unique
timescale f or the crystal growth from the evolution of structure, surface
tension, and visual inspection, which can be controlled through varying the SDS
or NaCl concentrations.

We have studied LK-99 [Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O], alleged by Lee et al.
to exhibit superconductivity above room temperature and at ambient pressure,
and have reproduced all anomalies in electric and magnetic measurements that
they reported as evidence for the claim of LK-99 being an ambient-pressure,

with the structural transition of the Cu$_2$S impurity in their sample and not
with superconductivity.

Modeling microstructure evolution in electrochemical systems is vital for
understanding the mechanism of various electrochemical processes. In this work,
we propose a general phase field framework that is fully variational and thus
guarantees that the energy decreases upon evolution in an isothermal system.
The bulk and interface free energies are decoupled using a grand potential
formulation to enhance numerical efficiency. The variational definition of the
overpotential is used, and the reaction kinetics is incorporated into the
evolution equation for the phase field to correctly capture capillary effects
and eliminate additional model parameter calibrations. A higher-order kinetic
correction is derived to accurately reproduce general reaction models such as
the Butler-Volmer, Marcus, and Marcus-Hush-Chidsey models. Electrostatic
potentials in the electrode and the electrolyte are considered separately as
independent variables, providing additional freedom to capture the interfacial
potential jump. To handle realistic materials and processing parameters for
practical applications, a driving force extension method is used to enhance the
grid size by three orders of magnitude. Finally, we comprehensively verify our
phase field model using classical electrochemical theory.

<br>
<br>
The development of spin-orbitronic devices, such as magneto-electric
spin-orbit logic devices, calls for materials with a high resistivity and a
high spin-charge interconversion efficiency. One of the most promising
candidates in this regard is sputtered Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$. Although there are
several techniques to quantify spin-charge interconversion, to date reported
values for sputtered Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ have often been overestimated due to
spurious effects related to local currents combined with a lack of
understanding of the effect of the interfaces and the use of approximations for
unknown parameters, such as the spin diffusion length. In the present study,
non-local spin valves are used to inject pure spin currents into
Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$, allowing us to directly obtain its spin diffusion length as
well as its spin Hall angle, from 10 K up to 300 K. These values, which are
more accurate than those previously reported in sputtered Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$,
evidence that the efficiency of this material is not exceptional. Indeed, the
figure of merit for spin-charge interconversion, given by the product of these
two parameters, is slightly under 1 nm. Our work demonstrates the importance of
considering all material parameters and interfaces when quantifying the spin
transport properties of materials with strong spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Direct Observation of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity in Electron  Donor-Acceptor Molecules</h3>

<br>
<br>
The role of chirality in determining the spin dynamics of photoinduced
electron transfer in donor-acceptor molecules remains an open question.
Although chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been demonstrated in
molecules bound to substrates, experimental information about whether this
process influences spin dynamics in the molecules themselves is lacking. Here
we use time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that
CISS strongly influences the spin dynamics of isolated covalent donor-chiral
bridge-acceptor (D-B$\chi$-A) molecules in which selective photoexcitation of D
is followed by two rapid, sequential electron transfer events to yield
D$^+$-B$\chi$-A$^-$. Exploiting this phenomenon affords the possibility of
using chiral molecular building blocks to control electron spin states in
quantum information applications.

The cytoskeleton, consisting of biopolymer filaments, molecular motors, and
passive crosslinking proteins, provides the internal structure of cells that
facilitate movement, growth, and cell division. Understanding the microscopic
motor-filament kinetics and dynamics is essential for comprehending macroscopic
behaviors of reconstituted cytoskeletal assemblies, such as self-organized flow
and active stress. In this study, we employ an adaptive fast Chebyshev
approximation based on tree search alongside parallel computing to accurately
recover the equilibrium distribution of crosslinking proteins, thus satisfying
detailed balance in binding through kinetic Monte Carlo sampling, while
maintaining cost-effectiveness. Additionally, we offer expandable features,
including segregating the simulation process via pre-building and allowing the
free-loading of different explicit formulations of the motor's potential
energy. This research has the potential to better describe the evolution of
cytoskeletal active matter.

We analyze dynamical transport properties of a hybrid nanostructure,
comprising a correlated quantum dot embedded between the source and drain
electrodes, which are subject to an ac voltage, focusing on signatures
imprinted on the charge transport by the side-attached Majorana zero-energy
mode. The considerations are based on the Kubo formula, for which the relevant
correlation functions are determined by using the numerical renormalization
group approach, which allows us to consider the correlation effects due to the
Coulomb repulsion and their interplay with the Majorana mode in a
non-perturbative manner. We point out universal features of the dynamical
conductance, showing up in the Kondo-Majorana regime, and differentiate them
against the conventional Kondo and Majorana systems. In particular, we predict
that the Majorana quasiparticles give rise to universal fractional values of
the ac conductance in the well-defined frequency range below the peak at the
Kondo scale. We also show this Kondo scale to actually increase with
strengthening the coupling to the topological superconducting wire.

<br>
<br>
The chemical stability of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) is the Achilles' heel
of the research on state-of-the-art organic solar cells (OSC). The fragility of
the NFA is essentially due to the weak bond that links the central donor core
of the molecules with their acceptor moieties at the edges. Here we proposed
the replacement of thiophene at the outer-core position of traditional NFAs for
tellurophene, a hitherto unexplored modification. Since tellurium is a
distinctive element among chalcogens, the basic features of Te compounds cannot
be deduced straightforwardly from the properties of their lighter analogues, S
and Se. The modeled Te-based NFAs presented interesting features like stronger
intra- and intermolecular interactions induced by a distinctive secondary bond
effect between the end acceptor moiety and the outer chalcogen atom. This
design strategy resulted in stiffer molecules with red-shifted absorption
spectra and less susceptible to degradation verified through stress tests and
vibrational spectra analysis. Besides that, a weakened exciton binding energy
has been found, opening the possibility of blends with a lower driving force.
Our results shed light on several aspects of selenation and telluration of
traditional NFAs, providing valuable insights into the possible consequences
for OSCs applications.

<h3>Shortcomings of using the SCAN functional for point defects and polarons  in semiconductors</h3>

<br>
We find the recently developed strongly constrained and appropriately
normalized (SCAN) functional, now widely used in calculations of many
materials, is not able to reliably describe the properties of deep defects and
small polarons in several semiconductors and insulators. These shortcomings are
due to a failure to identify the large structural distortions and charge
localization that accompanies the presence of defects and the formation of
small polarons. Our results indicate the SCAN functional is insufficient to
yield quantitative and qualitatively accurate results for defect calculations.

<br>
<br>
The electronic structure of the $f$-based superconductor $\mathrm{CeIr_3}$
was studied by photoelectron spectroscopy. The energy distribution of the
$\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states were revealed by the $\mathrm{Ce}~3d-4f$ resonant
photoelectron spectroscopy. The $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states were mostly distributed
in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, suggesting the itinerant character of the
$\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states. The contribution of the $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states to the
density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy was estimated to be nearly half of
that of the $\mathrm{Ir}~5d$ states, implying that the $\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states
have a considerable contribution to the DOS at the Fermi energy. The
$\mathrm{Ce}~3d$ core-level and $\mathrm{Ce}~3d$ X-ray absorption spectra were
analyzed based on a single-impurity Anderson model. The number of the
$\mathrm{Ce}~4f$ states in the ground state was estimated to be $0.8-0.9$,
which is much larger than the values obtained in the previous studies (i.e.,
$0-0.4$).

<br>
<br>
The charge density wave (CDW) or nematicity has been found to coexist with
superconductivity in many systems. It is thus interesting that the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in the doped BaNi$_2$As$_2$ system
can be enhanced up to six times as the CDW or nematicity in the undoped
compound is suppressed. Here we show that the transverse acoustic phonons of
Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$ are strongly damped in a wide doping range and
over the whole $Q$ range, which excludes its origin from either CDW or
nematicity. The damping of TA phonons can be understood as large
electron-phonon coupling and possible strong hybridization between acoustic and
optical phonons as shown by the first-principle calculations. The
superconductivity can be quantitatively reproduced by the change of
electron-phonon coupling constant calculated by the McMillan equation in the
BCS framework, which suggests that no quantum fluctuations of any order is
needed to promote the superconductivity. On the contrary, the change of $T_c$
in this system should be understood as the six-fold suppression of
superconductivity in undoped compounds.

We report first-principles calculations that propose a nonvolatile spin field
effect transistor (spin- FET) based on a van der Waals multiferroic
heterostructure, i.e., VSi2N4/Sc2CO2. We find that the inversion of
ferroelectric polarization of monolayer Sc2CO2 can efficiently modulate the
electronic states of monolayer VSi2N4. A half-metal to half-semiconductor phase
translation of VSi2N4 can be efficiently realized, which leads to distinct
electronic transport properties. We additionally construct a spin-FET device
based on the multiferroic heterostructure. We find that the VSi2 N4 /Sc2 CO2
based Spin-FET has remarkable all-electric-controlled performance. A large
on-off current ratio of about 650% induced by the inversion of Sc2CO2
ferroelectric polarization can be obtained under a small bias voltage (0.02 V).
We also find an interesting spatially-separated spin-polarized transport
phenomenon, with the pure spin-up (spin-down) electrons transporting merely in
VSi2N4 (Sc2CO2). Our study provides a promising approach for constructing
low-energy-dissipation and nonvolatile FET devices.

Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces of superconducting states arise from point or line
nodes by breaking time-reversal symmetry. Because line and point nodes often
accompany topologically protected zero-energy surface Andreev bound states
(ASBSs) and thereby lead to a characteristic zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP)
in tunneling spectroscopy, we investigate how these properties change when the
line and point nodes deform into BFSs. In this paper, we consider spin-quintet
$J_{\rm pair}=2$ pairing states of spin-3/2 electrons with BFSs and calculate
the surface density of states and the charge conductance. Comparing the
obtained results with the cases of spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing states having
the same symmetry, we find that the ZBCP associated with point and/or line
nodes is blunted or split in accordance with the appearance of the BFSs. On the
other hand, when the spin-singlet $d$-wave state has point nodes but does not
have SABS on the surface, we obtain a nonzero small electron conductivity at
zero bias through the zero-energy states on the BFSs.

<h3>Carrier screening controls transport in conjugated polymers at high  doping concentrations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Transport properties of doped conjugated polymers (CPs) have been widely
analyzed with the Gaussian Disorder Model (GDM) in conjunction with hopping
transport between localized states. These models reveal that even in highly
doped CPs, a majority of carriers are still localized because dielectric
permittivity of CPs is well below that of inorganic materials, making Coulomb
interactions between carriers and dopant counter-ions much more pronounced.
However, previous studies within the GDM did not consider the role of screening
the dielectric interactions by carriers. Here we implement carrier screening in
the Debye-H\"uckel formalism in our calculations of dopant-induced energetic
disorder, which modifies the Gaussian density of states (DOS). Then we solve
the Pauli Master Equation using Miller-Abrahams hopping rates with states from
the resulting screened DOS to obtain conductivity and Seebeck coefficient
across a broad range of carrier concentrations and compare them to
measurements. Our results show that screening has significant impact on the
shape of the DOS and consequently on carrier transport, particularly at high
doping. We prove that the slope of Seebeck coefficient vs electric
conductivity, which was previously thought to be universal, is impacted by
screening and decreases for systems with small dopant-carrier separation,
explaining our measurements. We also show that thermoelectric power factor is
underestimated by a factor of $\sim10$ at higher doping concentrations if
screening is neglected. We conclude that carrier screening plays a crucial role
in curtailing dopant-induced energetic disorder, particularly at high carrier
concentrations.

The presence of random disorder in a metallic system accounts for the
localization of extended states in general. On the contrary, the presence of
disorder can induce topological phases hosting metallic boundary states out of
a non-topological system, giving birth to the topological Anderson insulator
phase. In this context, we theoretically investigate the generation of an out
of equilibrium higher-order topological Anderson phase in the presence of
disorder potential in a time-periodic dynamical background. In particular, the
time-dependent drive and the disorder potential concomitantly render the
generation of Floquet higher-order topological Anderson insulator~(FHOTAI)
phase, while the clean, undriven system is topologically trivial. We showcase
the generation of FHOTAI hosting both $0$- and $\pi$-modes. Most importantly,
we develop the real space topological invariant -- a winding number based on
chiral symmetry to characterize the Floquet $0$ -- and $\pi$-modes distinctly.
This chiral winding number serves the purpose of the indicator for the
topological phase transition in the presence of drive as well as disorder and
appropriately characterizes the FHOTAI.

Topological semimetals with massless Dirac and Weyl fermions represent the
forefront of quantum materials research. In two dimensions, a peculiar class of
fermions that are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular
direction was predicted fifteen years ago. These highly exotic quasiparticles -
the semi-Dirac fermions - ignited intense theoretical interest but remain
undetected. Using magneto-optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate the defining
feature of semi-Dirac fermions - B^(2/3) scaling of Landau levels - in a
prototypical nodal-line metal ZrSiS. In topological metals, including ZrSiS,
nodal-lines extend the band degeneracies from isolated points to lines, loops
or even chains in the momentum space. With ab initio calculations and
theoretical modeling, we pinpoint the observed semi-Dirac spectrum to the
crossing points of nodal-lines in ZrSiS. Crossing nodal-lines exhibit a
continuum absorption spectrum but with singularities that scale as B^(2/3) at
the crossing. Our work sheds light on the hidden quasiparticles emerging from
the intricate topology of crossing nodal-lines.

We investigate the low-frequency electrodynamics in the vortex state of two

Nitride (NbN) and a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe).
We employ a two-coil mutual inductance technique to extract the complex
penetration depth, $\tilde{\lambda}$. The sample response is studied through
the temperature variation of $\tilde{\lambda}$ in the mixed state, where we
employ a model developed by Coffey and Clem (CC model) to extract the different
vortex lattice (VL) parameters such as the restoring pinning force constant
(Labusch parameter), VL drag coefficient and pinning potential barrier. We
observe that a consistent description of the inductive and dissipative part of
the response is only possible when we take the viscous drag on the vortices to
be several orders of magnitudes larger than viscous drag estimated from the
Bardeen-Stephen model.

Initial conditions after quenching from a high-temperature paraelectric phase
to a low-temperature ferroelectric phase have a substantial impact on the
temporal development and formation of stable polarization domain structures
which eventually determine physical properties and the functionality of
ferroelectrics. Based on the recently advanced exactly solvable model of the
stochastic domain structure kinetics in a uniaxial ferroelectric [Phys. Rev. B
107, 144109 (2023)], we study the effect of the magnitude of the initial
disorder, its initial correlation length and polarization correlation function
on the system evolution. For different shapes of the initial correlation
function, the time-dependent correlation length and the two-point polarization
correlation coefficient are calculated analytically demonstrating universal
features and a good agreement with the available experimental data.
Particularly, the magnitude of the charge density correlation function reveals
a strong reduction of the bound charges at the nominally charged domain walls
which was recently observed experimentally in uniaxial ferroelectrics.
Consequently, the integrodifferential equations of evolution for the
polarization correlation function and the mean polarization are numerically
solved for different initial conditions. The temporal dependence of the
polarization mean value and variance are evaluated demonstrating the
bifurcation behavior depending on the applied electric field. The impact of the
initial state properties on the coercive field deciding between the single- and
multi-domain final states of the system is disclosed.

The interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder dramatically influences
system's localization properties, giving rise to intriguing quantum phenomena.
Although the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is robust against the
weak disorder even in a one-dimensional system, it becomes Anderson
localization under strong disorder. Here, we study a
localization-delocalization transition by coupling a strongly disordered
Hatano-Nelson (HN) chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with its disorder
correlated to that of HN chain. Regardless of the disorder strength, as the
coupling strength between HN and Hermitian chain increases, a delocalization
transition occurs. This leads to a reentrant NHSE due to the interplay of
non-Hermiticity and correlated disorder. We real the underlying mechanism for
the reentrant NHSE under correlated disorder. Moreover, the
localization-delocalization transition is well captured by the real-space
winding number.

We study classical spin models on the 1/1 Tsai-type approximant lattice using
Monte Carlo and mean-field methods. Our aim is to understand whether the phase
diagram differences between Gd- and Tb-based approximants can be attributed to
anisotropy induced by the crystal-electric field. To address this question, we
treat Gd ions as Heisenberg spins and Tb ions as Ising spins. Additionally, we
consider the presence of the RKKY interaction to replicate the experimentally
observed correlation between magnetic properties and electron concentration.
Surprisingly, our findings show that the transition between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic order remains unaltered by the anisotropy, even when
accounting for the dipole interaction. We conclude that a more comprehensive
model, extending beyond the free-electron gas RKKY interaction, is likely
required to fully understand the distinctions between Gd- and Tb-based
approximants. Our work represents a systematic exploration of the impact of
anisotropy on the ground-state properties of classical spin models in
quasicrystal approximants.

The present studies show that long-range magnetic order takes place in
RuBr$_3$ at $\approx$ 34 K. The observations of clear oscillations in the muon
time spectra demonstrate the presence of well-defined internal fields at the
muon sites. The magnetic ordering appears to be very robust and static
suggesting a more conventional nature of magnetic ordering in the RuBr$_3$

interactions are likely to be weakened at zero field in comparison to the
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ system. This proves that it is possible to tune the Kitaev
interactions by replacing Cl with heavier halogen elements such as Br.

<br>
Based on the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the axial approximation, the
transcendental equation determining the hole subband dispersions in a
cylindrical Ge nanowire is analytically derived. This equation is more general
than that derived using the spherical approximation, and is suitable to study
the growth direction dependence of the subband dispersions. The axial
approximation almost gives the accurate low-energy subband dispersions for high
symmetry nanowire growth directions [001] and [111]. The perturbation
corrections from the non-axial terms are negligible for these two directions.
The lowest two subband dispersions can be regarded as two shifted parabolic
curves with an energy gap at $k_{z}=0$ for both growth directions [001] and
[111]. At the site of the energy gap, the eigenstates for growth direction
[111] are inverted types of that for growth direction [001]. A nanowire growth
direction where the energy gap at $k_{z}=0$ closes is predicted to exist
between directions [001] and [111].

The dynamics of active smectic liquid crystals confined on a spherical
surface is explored through an active phase field crystal model. Starting from
an initially randomly perturbed isotropic phase, several types of topological
defects are spontaneously formed, and then annihilate during a coarsening
process until a steady state is achieved. The coarsening process is highly
complex involving several scaling laws of defect densities as a function of
time where different dynamical exponents can be identified. In general the
exponent for the final stage towards the steady state is significantly larger
than that in the passive and in the planar case, i.e., the coarsening is
getting accelerated both by activity and by the topological and geometrical
properties of the sphere. A defect type characteristic for this active system
is a rotating spiral of evolving smectic layering lines. On a sphere this
defect type also determines the steady state. Our results can in principle be
confirmed by dense systems of synthetic or biological active particles.

<br>
<br>
During the mechano-fusion process for dry particle coating,
(hetero)-aggregates are formed consisting of host particles which are coated by
smaller guest particles. During this process, the latter are exposed to intense
particle-particle interactions and particle-wall impacts, which lead to
deformation of the guest particles original shape. These deformations on the
nano- and microscale can heavily influence the effective macroscopic properties
of the resutling coated particles. We present a method to quantify the shape
deformation of guest particles during mechano-fusion based on measurements
acquired by atomic force microscopy before and after mechano-fusion. To this
end, we reconstruct the 3D shape of guest particles by means of an ellipsoidal
fit, constrained by the known volume of the guest particles. Using these
reconstructed shapes, we can quantify the degree of deformation by comparing
the aspect ratios of the ellipsoidal fits before and after mechano-fusion. Such
a quantification enhances the understanding of how process-related parameters
influence the geometric descriptors of the involved particles, which in turn
impact the overall macroscopic properties of the material.

<h3>Phase coexistence in a half-filled extended Hubbard model</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
In this Letter we analyze the coexisting ordered phases that arise in the
half-filled $\varepsilon$-t-U-V extended Hubbard Model on the square lattice
when tackled within the Kotliar andRuckenstein slave boson representation in
the thermodynamical limit. Particular emphasis is put on the dependence of the
quasiparticle dispersions, the gaps, the spin-resolved renormalization factors,
and the distribution of double occupancy on the microscopical parameters of the
model. Our calculations are performed in a parameter range that is most
suitable for resistive switching. In particular, the main contributions to the
gaps are shown to either arise from $\varepsilon$ in the weak coupling regime,
or from U and V when they are the largest scales. The gaps are thus from joint
spin and charge origin, and so are the order parameters.

<br>
We study the non-equilibrium steady states in a totally-asymmetric
simple-exclusion process with periodic boundary conditions, also incorporating
(i) an extra (nearest-neighbour) repulsive interaction and (ii) hopping rates
characterized by a smooth spatial inhomogeneity. We make use of a generalized
mean-field approach (at the level of nearest-neighbour pair clusters), in
combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. It turns out that the
so-called shock phase can exhibit a lot of qualitatively different subphases,
including multiple-shock phases, and a minimal-current shock phase. We argue
that the resulting, considerably rich phase diagram should be relatively
insensitive to minor details of either interaction or spatial inhomogeneity. As
a consequence, we also expect that our results help elucidate the nature of
shock subphases detected in previous studies.

<br>
<br>
In a class of periodically driven systems, multifractal states in
non-equilibrium conditions and robustness of dynamical localization when the
driving is made aperiodic have received considerable attention. In this paper,
we explore a family of one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models that are
quasi-periodically kicked with protocols following different binary
quasi-periodic sequences, which can be realized in ultracold atom systems. The
relationship between the systems' localization properties and the sequences'
mathematical features is established utilizing the Floquet theorem and the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We investigate the multifractality and
pre-thermalization of the eigenstates of the unitary evolution operator
combined with an analysis of the transport properties of initially localized
wave packets. We further contend that the quasi-periodically kicked
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model provides a rich phase diagram as the periodic case
but also brings the range of parameters to observe multifractal states and
pre-thermalization to a regime more amenable to experiments.

<br>
<br>
Thermal fatigue is a common failure mode in electronic solder joints, yet the
role of microstructure is incompletely understood. Here, we quantify the
evolution of microstructure and damage in Sn-3Ag-0.5Cu joints throughout a ball
grid array (BGA) package using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping
of localised subgrains, recrystallisation and heavily coarsened Ag3Sn. We then
interpret the results with a multi-scale modelling approach that links from a
continuum model at the package/board scale through to a crystal plasticity
finite element model at the microstructure scale accounting for the anisotropic
thermal expansion, elastic and plastic properties of beta-Sn with embedded
Ag3Sn and Cu6Sn5 particles. We measure and explain the dependence of damage
evolution on (i) the beta-Sn crystal orientation(s) in single and multigrain
joints, and (ii) the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between
tin grains in cyclic twinned multigrain joints. We further explore the relative
importance of the solder microstructure versus the joint location in the array.
The results provide a basis for designing optimum solder joint microstructures
for thermal fatigue resistance.

Rare-earth (RE) kagome-lattice magnets offer an excellent platform to
discover the novel magnetic phase as well as quantum phase transition tuned by
non-thermal control parameters, while the experimental realizations remain
largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of magnetic-field (B)-induced
anisotropic quantum phase transition in a distorted kagome antiferromagnet
Nd3BWO9 with TN~0.32 K. The isothermal magnetizations at 0.05 K exhibit the
spin-flop like metamagnetic crossover behaviors with different fractional
magnetization anomalies for B perpendicular (B // c-axis) and parallel (B //
a*-axis) to the kagome plane, respectively. In combination with the
thermodynamic measurements, the field-temperature (B-T) phase diagrams for both
field directions are constructed and that reveal the existence of several
field-induced magnetic states. Along the c-axis, a proximate quantum bicritical
point is observed near the metamagnetic crossover, which separates the
low-field antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and the intermediate AFM phase. While,
for B // a*, another intermediate magnetic phase (IAFM2) appears between the
low-field AFM phase and intermediate AFM (IAFM1) phase, giving rise to a
tetracritical point. These results support the anisotropic field-induced
metamagnetic quantum criticalities in Nd3BWO9, making it as a rare kagome
antiferromagnet to investigate the quantum multi-criticality driven by spin
frustration.

We study the topological entanglement entropy and scalar chirality of a
topologically ordered skyrmion formed in a two-dimensional triangular lattice.
Scalar chirality remains a smooth function of the magnetic field in both
helical and quantum skyrmion phases. In contrast, topological entanglement
entropy remains almost constant in the quantum skyrmion phase, whereas it
experiences enhanced fluctuations in the helical phase. Therefore, topological
entanglement entropy is an effective tool to distinguish between the two phases
and pinpoint the quantum phase transition in the system.

Dark field X-ray microscopy (DXFM) has enabled experiments to visualize
microstructural distortions in bulk crystals. Using the femtosecond X-ray
pulses generated by X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL), DFXM can achieve ~1-um
spatial resolution and <100 fs time resolution simultaneously. In this paper,
we present the first ultrafast DFXM measurements at the European XFEL. In this
work, we demonstrate DFXM of laser-induced phonon wavepackets propagating
through dislocations inside a diamond single crystal. In addition to
demonstrating this new capability, we present two new DFXM scanning techniques
for XFEL applications, 3D and axial-strain scans with sub-{\mu}m spatial
resolution. With this progress to XFEL DFXM, we discuss new opportunities to
study multi-timescale spatio-temporal dynamics of defects, strain waves, and
other localized phenomena deep inside crystals.

Knotted proteins, when forced through the pores, can get stuck if the knots
in their backbone tighten under force. Alternatively, the knot can slide off
the chain, making translocation possible. We construct a simple energy
landscape model of this process with a time-periodic potential that mimics the
action of a molecular motor. We calculate the translocation time as a function
of the period of the pulling force, discuss the asymptotic limits and
biological relevance of the results.

<h3>Sensitivity of solid phase stability to the interparticle potential  range: studies of a new Lennard-Jones like model</h3>

<i>Olivia S. Moro, Vincent Ballenegger, Tom L. Underwood, Nigel B. Wilding</i>
<br>
<br>
In a recent article, Wang et al (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 22, 10624 (2020))
introduced a new class of interparticle potential for molecular simulations.
The potential is defined by a single range parameter, eliminating the need to
decide how to truncate truly long-range interactions like the Lennard-Jones
(LJ) potential. The authors explored the phase diagram for a particular value
of the range parameter for which their potential is similar in shape to the LJ
12-6 potential. We have reevaluated the solid phase behaviour of this model
using both Lattice Switch Monte Carlo and thermodynamic integration. In
addition to finding that the boundary between hexagonal close packed (hcp) and
face centred cubic (fcc) phases presented by Wang et al was calculated
incorrectly, we show that owing to its finite range, the new potential exhibits
several 'artifact' reentrant transitions between hcp and fcc phases. The
artifact phases, which do not occur in the full (untruncated) LJ system, are
also found for typically adopted forms of the truncated and shifted LJ
potential. However, whilst in the latter case one can systematically
investigate and correct for the effects of the finite range on the calculated
phase behaviour, this is not possible for the new potential because the choice
of range parameter affects the entire potential shape. Our results highlight
that potentials with finite range may fail to represent the crystalline phase
behaviour of systems with long-range dispersion interactions, even
qualitatively.

<h3>The Binding Energy of Triplet Excitons in Non-Fullerene Acceptors: The  Effects of Fluorination and Chlorination</h3>

<br>
<br>
One strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of non-fullerene
acceptors (NFAs) is the rational fluorination or chlorination of those
molecules. Although this modification improves important acceptor properties,
little is known about the effects on the triplet states. Here, we combine the
polarizable continuum model with optimally tuned range-separated hybrid
functional to investigate this issue. We find that fluorination or chlorination
of NFAs decreases the degree of HOMO-LUMO overlap along these molecules.
Consequently, the energy gap between $T_{1}$ and $S_{1}$ states, $\Delta E_{ST}
= E_{S_{1}} - E_{T_{1}}$, also decreases. This effect simultaneously enhances
the generation of triplet excitons and reduce the binding energy of the triplet
excitons ($E_{b,T}$) which favor their dissociation into free charges.
Interestingly, although Cl has a lower electronegativity than F, the
chlorination is more effective to reduce $\Delta E_{ST}$. Since chlorination of
NFAs is easier than fluorination, Cl substitution can be a useful approach to
enhance solar energy harvesting using triplet excitons.

Based on the Wilson's criterion metal-insulator, extended to materials with
strong electronic correlations, we have identified a specific class of the
materials, which is not associated with their usual classification into
Mott-Hubbard and charge transfer dielectrics. The local symmetry of these
materials leads to a disappearance of quasiparticle states (so-called first
removal or fist extra states) in the Hubbard's gap. It's especially unusual for
the doped materials, where quasiparticles - charge carriers can disappear or
appear under external factors, but the Mott transition has not yet been
achieved. In the work we introduced the so-called a "quasiparticle
transparency", and also provided specific experiments to identify materials
with the low quasiparticle transparency. Some examples of these materials with
a spin crossover under high pressure and showing Jahn-Teller nature have been
observed.

<br>

The large variety of complex electronic structure materials and their alloys,
offer highly promising directions for improvements in thermoelectric (TE) power
factors (PF). Their electronic structure contains rich features, referred to as
'surface complexity', one of them being the highly anisotropic warped energy
surface shapes with elongated features and threads in some cases. In this work
we use Boltzmann transport simulations to quantify the influence that the shape
of the electronic structure energy surfaces has on the PF. Using both
analytical ellipsoidal bands, as well as realistic bands from the group of
half-Heuslers, we show that band shape complexity alone can offer an advantage
to the PF of ~3x in realistic cases. The presence of anisotropic scattering
mechanisms such as ionized impurity or polar optical phonon scattering,
however, can reduce these improvements by up to ~50%. We show that expressions
based on the simple ratio of the density-of-states to the conductivity
effective masses, mDOS/mC, together with the number of valleys, can capture the
anisotropy shape with a moderate to high degree of correlation. For this, we
use a convenient way to extract these masses by mapping the complex
bandstructures of materials to parabolic electronic structures, without the
need for Boltzmann transport codes. Despite the fact that the PF depends on
many parameters, information about the benefits of the band shape alone, would
be very useful for identifying and understanding the performance of novel
thermoelectric materials.

The minimum driving force strategy is applied to promote the exciton
dissociation in organic solar cells (OSCs) without significant loss of
open-circuit voltage. However, this strategy tends to promote F\"orster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the donor to the acceptor (D-A), a
consequence generally ignored until recently. In spite of the advances reported
on this topic, the correlation between charge-transfer (CT) state binding
energy and driving force remains unclear, especially in the presence of D-A
FRET. To address this question, we employ a kinetic approach to model the
charge separation in ten different D/A blends using non-fullerene acceptors.
The model considers the influence of FRET on photoluminescence (PL) quenching
efficiency. It successfully predicts the measured PL quenching efficiency for D
or A photoexcitation in those blends, including the ones for which the D-A FRET
process is relevant. Furthermore, the application of the model allows to
quantifying the fractions of quenching loss associated with charge transfer and
energy transfer. Fundamental relationships that controls the exciton
dissociation was derived evidencing the key roles played by the Marcus inverted
regime, exciton lifetime and mainly by the correlation between the driving
force and binding energy of CT state. Based on those findings, we propose some
strategies to maximize the quenching efficiency and minimize energy loss of
OSCs in the presence of D-A FRET.

Computing dynamical properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems poses a major challenge to theoretical approaches. Usually, one has to
resort to numerical analytic continuation of results on imaginary frequencies,
which is a mathematically ill-defined procedure. Here, we present an efficient
method to compute the spectral functions of the two-component Fermi gas near
the strongly interacting unitary limit directly in real frequencies. To this
end, we combine the Keldysh path integral that is defined in real time with the
self-consistent T-matrix approximation. The latter is known to predict
thermodynamic and transport properties in good agreement with experimental
observations in ultracold atoms. We validate our method by comparison with
thermodynamic quantities obtained from imaginary time calculations and by
transforming our real-time propagators to imaginary time. By comparison with
state-of-the-art numerical analytic continuation of the imaginary time results,
we show that our real-time results give qualitative improvements for dynamical
quantities. Moreover, we show that no significant pseudogap regime exists in
the self-consistent T-matrix approximation above the critical temperature
$T_c$, an issue that has been under significant debate. We close by pointing
out the versatile nature of our method as it can be extended to other systems,
like the spin- or mass-imbalanced Fermi gas, other Bose-Fermi models, 2D
systems as well as systems out of equilibrium.

Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell has emerged as one of the most
promising candidates for thin-film photovoltaics. However, severe charge losses
occurring at the grain boundaries (GBs) of Kesterite polycrystalline absorbers
has hindered the improvement of cell performance. Herein, we report a redox
reaction strategy involving palladium (Pd) to eliminate atomic vacancy defects
such as VSn and VSe in GBs of the Kesterite absorbers. We demonstrate that
PdSex compounds could form during the selenization process and distribute at
the GBs and the absorber surfaces; thereby aid in the suppression of Sn and Se
volatilization loss and inhibiting the formation of VSn and VSe defects.
Furthermore, Pd(II)/Pd(IV) serves as a redox shuttle, i.e., on one hand, Pd(II)
captures Se vapor from the reaction environment to produce PdSe2, on the other
hand, PdSe2 provides Se atoms to the Kesterite absorber by being reduced to
PdSe, thus contributing to the elimination of pre-existing VSe defects within
GBs. These effects collectively reduce defects and enhance the p-type
characteristics of the Kesterite absorber, leading to a significant reduction
in charge recombination loss within the cell. As a result, high-performance
Kesterite solar cells with a total-area efficiency of 14.5% have been achieved.
This remarkable efficiency increase benefited from the redox reaction strategy
offers a promising avenue for the precise regulation of defects in Kesterite
solar cells and holds generally significant implications for the exploration of
various other photovoltaic devices.

Novel topological properties that arose in the periodically driven system are
unique, in which there are two kinds of quasienergy gaps, the zero quasienergy
gap and the $\pi$ quasienergy gap. The corresponding edge modes would traverse
either the zero quasienergy gap or the $\pi$ quasienergy gap, or traverse both
two quasienergy gaps. And the characterization of these two kinds of edge modes
might not be the same. However, in this paper, we find that both the zero edge
modes and the $\pi$ edge modes in the Floquet Chern insulators can be
characterized by the same topological invariant, where the corresponding Dirac
mass term is periodically kicked. Particularly, we take the periodically kicked
Qi-Wu-Zhang model as an illustrative example. In this model, the topology is
characterized by the Floquet Chern number $C_F$, and there are six different
topological phases in total, denoted as $C_F=\{-1_0,-2,-1_\pi,1_\pi,2,1_0\}$.
Furthermore, we find that the Floquet operator associated with the periodically
kicked Qi-Wu-Zhang model reduces to a Dirac Hamiltonian in the low-energy
limit. Then, the phase diagram is uncovered by examining the topology of this
Dirac Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the orders of topological phase
transitions in the context of Floquet stationary states by analyzing the von
Neumann entropy of these states. Our work provides further insights into the
topological phases in periodically driven systems.

Quantum many-body systems are expected to relax to a thermal state over time,
with some exceptions such as systems with atypical eigenstates. In this study,
we investigate the effect of the existence of spatially localized eigenstates
on the relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons loaded into a one-dimensional
sawtooth lattice, which exhibits a flat band in the single-particle spectrum by
tuning the hopping rates. Using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm,
we simulate the time evolution of the local density profile based on the
Bose-Hubbard model with different initial conditions. Our results show the
presence of the flat band leads to a significant slowing down of diffusion for
weak interactions. Even for strong interaction, when the initial state includes
an isolated localized single-particle eigenstate in the superposition, remnants
of that state persist for a long time. This particular relaxation dynamics can
be tested using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

Starting from the {\em ab initio} many-body theory of electrons and phonons,
we go through a series of well defined simplifications to derive a set of
coupled equations of motion for the electronic occupations and polarizations,
nuclear displacements as well as phononic occupations and coherences. These are
the semiconductor electron-phonon equations (SEPE), sharing the same scaling
with system size and propagation time as the Boltzmann equations. At the core
of the SEPE is the {\em mirrored} Generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA) for
the Green's functions, an alternative to the standard GKBA which we show to
lead to unstable equilibrium states. The SEPE treat coherent and incoherent
degrees of freedom on equal footing, widen the scope of the semiconductor Bloch
equations and Boltzmann equations, and reduce to them under additional
simplifications. The new features of the SEPE pave the way for first-principles
studies of phonon squeezed states and coherence effects in time-resolved
absorption and diffraction experiments.

Charge transport in disordered two-dimensional (2D) systems showcases a
myriad of unique phenomenologies that highlight different aspects of the
underlying quantum dynamics. In the presence of disorder, 2D electrons
transition from a non-local ballistic propagation to an Anderson insulating
regime of suppressed transport, depending on the system's effective coherence
length. Between these two regimes, lies a diffusive crossover in which
transport becomes local and can be appropriately described by an intensive
conductivity. This rich physics stems from the coexistence of two relevant
length scales: the elastic mean-free path and the localization length. In
weakly disordered 2D systems, these scales diverge exponentially, which opens
the door to a smooth crossover where charge transport is effectively dominated
only by the elastic mean-free path.
In numerical studies, a clear observation of a diffusive crossover remains
elusive, as it requires fully coherent transport to be simulated across systems
that are large enough to meaningfully split the two relevant length scales. In
this paper, we employ time-resolved current simulations to solve this problem
in lattice systems with explicitly included (finite) leads. Importantly, we
introduce a new linearly-scaling approach that integrates stochastic trace
evaluation techniques with efficient Chebyshev quantum time-evolution, and a
bandwidth compression scheme of the leads, thus enabling the simulation of
sufficiently large system sizes. Our findings are demonstrated in a toy-model
of a square lattice nanoribbon with diagonal disorder that is inserted into a
two-contact mesoscopic device. All three of the expected 2D transport regimes -
ballistic, diffusive, and localized - are unambiguously observed within this
simple setup.

In this study, we aim to explore the effect of chirality on the phase
behavior of active helical particles driven by two-temperature scalar activity.
We first calculate the equation of state of soft helical particles of various
intrinsic chiralities using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In equilibrium,
the emergence of various liquid crystal (LC) phases such as nematic (N),
cholesteric ($N_{c}^{*}$), smectic (Sm), as well as crystal (K), crucially
depends on the presence of the walls, which induce homeotropic alignment. Next,
we introduce activity through the two-temperature model: keep increasing the
temperature of half of the helical particles (labeled as 'hot' particles) while
maintaining the temperature of the other half at a lower value (labeled as
'cold' particles). Starting from a homogeneous isotropic (I) phase, we find the
emergence of 2-TIPS: two temperature-induced phase separations between the hot
and cold particles. We also observe the cold particles undergo an ordering
transition to various LC phases even in the absence of a wall. This observation
reveals that the hot-cold interface in the active system plays the role of a
wall in the equilibrium system by inducing an alignment direction for the cold
particles. However, in the case of a cholesteric phase, we observe activity
destabilizes the $N_{c}^{*}$ phase by inducing smectic ordering in the cold
zone while isotropic structure in the hot zone. The smectic ordering in the
cold zone eventually transforms to a chiral crystal phase at high enough
activity.

We report X-ray diffraction and magnetic susceptibility studies of the
structural phase transition in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. By utilizing a single
crystal sample with predominantly single twin domain, we show that
$\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ goes from high-temperature C2/m structure to a rhombohedral
structure with R$\bar{3}$ symmetry at low temperature. While the defining
feature of the structural transition is changing the stacking direction from
the monoclinic a-axis to the b-axis, bond-anisotropy disappears when the
structural change occurs, indicating that the local $C_3$ symmetry is restored
within the honeycomb layer. The symmetry change is corroborated by the
vanishing magnetic anisotropy in the low-temperature structure. Our study
demonstrates that magnetic interaction is extremely sensitive to structural
details in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, which could explain the sample dependence found
in this material.

Hygro-responsive materials exhibit a complex structure-to-property
relationship. The interactions of water within these materials under varying
hygric and mechanical loads play a crucial role in their macroscopic
deformation and final application. While multiple models are available in
literature, many lack a comprehensive physical understanding of these
phenomena. In this study, we introduce a novel Stick-Slip Fiber Bundle Model
that captures the fundamental behaviors of hygro-responsive materials. We
incorporate moisture-dependent elements and rules governing the initiation and
relaxation of slip strains as well as failure to the statistical approach
offered by Fiber Bundle Models. The additional features are based on
well-founded interpretations of the structure-to-property relationship in
cellulosic materials. Slip strains are triggered by changes in load and
moisture, as well as by creep deformations. When subjected to moisture cycles,
the model accumulates slip strains, resulting in mechanosorptive behavior. When
the load is removed, slip strains are partially relaxed, and subsequent
moisture cycles trigger further relaxation, as expected from observations with
mechanosorptive material. Importantly, these slip strains are not considered
plastic strains; instead, they are unified, non-linear frozen strains,
activated by various stimuli. Failure of fibers is defined by a critical number
of slip events allowing for an integrated simulation from intact, via damaged,
failed states. We investigate the transition between these regimes upon changes
in the hygric and mechanical loading history for relevant parameter ranges. Our
enhanced Stick-Slip Fiber Bundle Model increases the understanding of the
intricate behavior of hygro-responsive materials and contributes to a more
robust framework for analyzing and interpreting their properties.

<h3>Quantum reaction-limited reaction-diffusion dynamics of noninteracting  Bose gases</h3>

We investigate quantum reaction-diffusion systems in one-dimension with
bosonic particles that coherently hop in a lattice, and when brought in range
react dissipatively. Such reactions involve binary annihilation ($A + A \to
\emptyset$) and coagulation ($A + A \to A$) of particles at distance $d$. We
consider the reaction-limited regime, where dissipative reactions take place at
a rate that is small compared to that of coherent hopping. In classical
reaction-diffusion systems, this regime is correctly captured by the mean-field
approximation. In quantum reaction-diffusion systems, for non-interacting
fermionic systems, the reaction-limited regime recently attracted considerable
attention because it has been shown to give universal power law decay beyond
mean-field for the density of particles as a function of time. Here, we address
the question whether such universal behavior is present also in the case of the
non-interacting Bose gas. We show that beyond mean-field density decay for
bosons is possible only for reactions that allow for destructive interference
of different decay channels. Furthermore, we study an absorbing-state phase
transition induced by the competition between branching $A\to A+A$, decay $A\to
\emptyset$ and coagulation $A+A\to A$. We find a stationary phase-diagram,
where a first and a second-order transition line meet at a bicritical point
which is described by tricritical directed percolation. These results show that
quantum statistics significantly impact on both the stationary and the
dynamical universal behavior of quantum reaction-diffusion systems.

<h3>Optical drive of amplitude and phase modes of the condensate in  excitonic insulators</h3>

Motivated by recent interests in exploring excitonic condensate as the ground
state of some narrow-bandgap semiconductors such as transition metal
dichalcogenides and layered chalcogenide material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, in this work
we theoretically study the dynamics of condensate in response to periodically
driven laser fields with different polarizations and intensities. In
particular, we consider laser light beams with bicircular and circular
polarizations breaking the time-revesal symmetry, and linear polarization. We
show that the amplitude of the condensate oscillates in time during irradiating
by light with a magnitude depending on the light intensity. The dynamics
survives even after the light is switched off. The phase mode however changes
linearly with time for a condensate originating from purely electronic
correlations. We further show that in the presence of electron-phonon coupling
the linear-in-time behavior is replaced by a harmonically oscillating behavior,
a manifestation of gapped phase modes due to relative band charge symmetry
breaking. Furthermore, we show that the primarily electronic and primarily
lattice cases corresponding to strong and weak electron-phonon coupling,
respectively, reveal distinct dynamics of the condensate, an observation which
can modify the optical response of an excitonic insulator by stimulating
amplitude and phase modes in the former case.

<h3>Dynamical exciton condensates in nonequilibrium electron-hole bilayers</h3>

Recent experiments have realized steady-state electrical injection of
interlayer excitons in electron-hole bilayers subject to a large bias voltage.
In the ideal case in which interlayer tunneling is negligibly weak, the system
is in quasi-equilibrium with a reduced effective band gap. Interlayer tunneling
introduces a current and drives the system out of equilibrium. In this work we
derive a nonequilibrium field theory description of interlayer excitons in
biased electron-hole bilayers. In the large bias limit, we find that p-wave
interlayer tunneling reduces the effective band gap and increases the effective
temperature for intervalley excitons. We discuss possible experimental
implications for InAs/GaSb quantum wells and transition metal dichalcogenide
bilayers.

<br>
<br>
The V-based kagome systems AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb and K) are unique by virtue of
the intricate interplay of non-trivial electronic structure, topology and
intriguing fermiology, rendering them to be a playground of many mutually
dependent exotic phases like charge-order and superconductivity. Despite
numerous recent studies, the interconnection of magnetism and other complex
collective phenomena in these systems has yet not arrived at any conclusion.
Using first-principles tools, we demonstrate that their electronic structures,
complex fermiologies and phonon dispersions are strongly influenced by the
interplay of dynamic electron correlations, non-trivial spin-polarization and
spin-orbit coupling. An investigation of the first-principles-derived
inter-site magnetic exchanges with the complementary analysis of q-dependence
of the electronic response functions and the electron-phonon coupling indicate
that the system conforms as a frustrated spin-cluster, where the occurrence of
the charge-order phase is intimately related to the mechanism of
electron-phonon coupling, rather than the Fermi-surface nesting.

Resetting is a renewal mechanism in which a process is intermittently
repeated after a random or fixed time. This simple act of stop and repeat
profoundly influences the behaviour of a system as exemplified by the emergence
of non-equilibrium properties and expedition of search processes. Herein, we
explore the ramifications of stochastic resetting in the context of a
single-file system called random average process (RAP) in one dimension. In
particular, we focus on the dynamics of tracer particles and analytically
compute the variance, equal time correlation, autocorrelation and unequal time
correlation between the positions of different tracer particles. Our study
unveils that resetting gives rise to rather different behaviours depending on
whether the particles move symmetrically or asymmetrically. For the asymmetric
case, the system for instance exhibits a long-range correlation which is not
seen in absence of the resetting. Similarly, in contrast to the reset-free RAP,
the variance shows distinct scalings for symmetric and asymmetric cases. While
for the symmetric case, it decays (towards its steady value) as $\sim e^{-r t}
/ \sqrt{t}$, we find $\sim t e^{-r t}$ decay for the asymmetric case ($r$ being
the resetting rate). Finally, we examine the autocorrelation and unequal time
correlation in the steady state and demonstrate that they obey interesting
scaling forms at late times. All our analytical results are substantiated by
extensive numerical simulations.

<br>
We have investigated the dynamical magnetic properties of the V-based kagome
stibnite compounds by combining the ab-initio calculated magnetic parameters of
a spin Hamiltonian like inter-site exchange parameters, magnetocrystalline
anisotropy and site projected magnetic moments, with full-fledged simulations
of atomistic spin-dynamics. Our calculations reveal that in addition to a
ferromagnetic order along the [001] direction, the system hosts a complex
landscape of magnetic configurations comprised of commensurate and
incommensurate spin-spirals along the [010] direction. The presence of such
chiral magnetic textures may be the key to solve the mystery about the origin
of the experimentally observed inherent breaking of the C6 rotational symmetry-
and the time-reversal symmetry.

We explore formation and dynamics of nonequilibrium bosonic exciton-polariton
condensates in annular optically induced traps. For the vicinity of
condensation pumping threshold, we develop the two-mode model, accounting for
counter-rotating quantized vortices and corresponding angular harmonics in the
incoherent excitonic reservoir density. Identifying the range of parameter, in
which adiabatic elimination of the reservoir is valid, we extend the analytic
model beyond the adiabatic approximation. In the circularly symmetric case, we
predict a neutral equilibrium phase due to spontaneous breaking of the
continuous symmetry, condensate multistability and limit cycle dynamics. We
also account for weak trap asymmetry to show that non-adiabaticity of the
coupled condensate-reservoir system prevents formation of giant vortices and
outline experimental conditions for their observation.

We introduce Spiral, a third-order integration algorithm for the rotational
motion of extended bodies. It requires only one force calculation per time
step, does not require quaternion normalization at each time step, and can be
formulated for both leapfrog and synchronous integration schemes, making it
compatible with many particle simulation codes. The stability and precision of
Spiral exceed those of state-of-the-art algorithms currently used in popular
DEM codes such as Yade, MercuryDPM, LIGGGHTS, PFC, and more, at only slightly
higher computational cost. Also, beyond DEM, we see potential applications in
all numerical simulations that involve the 3D rotation of extended bodies.

<h3>Buckyballs directly probe inter-valley coherence and intra-valley  pairing in moire heterostructures</h3>

Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich
playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can
be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via
twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that
the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting
level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation
of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged
interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence
(IVC). However, there is no direct experimental probe of this ubiquitous
ordering tendency. Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by
coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the
pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in
fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an
appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of
IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling
microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a
sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order
parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial
first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these
exotic `normal' states.

<br>
The upper critical field of multi-band superconductors can be an essential
quantity to unravel the nature of superconducting pairing and its interplay
with the electronic structure. Here we experimentally map out the complete
upper critical field phase diagram of FeSe for different magnetic field
orientations at temperatures down to 0.3 K using both resistivity and torque
measurements. The temperature dependence of the upper critical field reflects
that of a multi-band superconductor and requires a two-band description in the
clean limit with band coupling parameters favouring interband over intraband
interactions. Despite the relatively small Maki parameter in FeSe of $\alpha
\sim 1.6$, the multi-band description of the upper critical field is consistent
with the stabilization of a FFLO state below $T/T_{\rm c}\sim 0.3$. We find
that the anomalous behaviour of the upper critical field is linked to a
departure from the single-band picture, and FeSe provides a clear example where
multi-band effects and the strong anisotropy of the superconducting gap need to
be taken into account.

Excitons -- quasiparticles formed by the binding of an electron and a hole
through electrostatic attraction -- hold promise in the fields of quantum light
confinement and optoelectronic sensing. Atomically thin transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a versatile platform for hosting and
manipulating excitons, given their robust Coulomb interactions and exceptional
sensitivity to dielectric environments. In this study, we introduce a cryogenic
photoelectrical nanosensing platform, termed exciton-resonant microwave
impedance microscopy (ER-MIM). ER-MIM enables ultra-sensitive probing of
exciton polarons and their Rydberg states at the nanoscale. Utilizing this
technique, we explore the interplay between excitons and material properties at
the nanoscale, including carrier density, in-plane electric field, and
dielectric screening. Furthermore, we employ a neural network algorithm for
automated data analysis and quantitative extraction of nanoscale electrical
information, unveiling the potential of exciton-assisted nano-electrometry. Our
findings establish an invaluable sensing platform and readout mechanism,
advancing our understanding of exciton excitations and their applications in

<h3>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer  graphene in the moiréless limit and in Coulomb imprinted superlattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04217</a>

<i>Boran Zhou, Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently fractional quantum anomalous hall effects (FQAH) attract lots of
attentions due to their experimental realizations in the moir\'e systems. The
standard theoretical framework assumes an isolated flat Chern band in the
single particle level. But in this paper we challenges this paradigm for the
FQAH in the five layer rhombohedral stacked graphene aligned with hexagon boron
nitride(hBN). We show that the external moir\'e superlattice potential is
simply a perturbation in a model with continuous translation symmetry. Through
Hartree fock calculation, we find that interaction opens a sizable superlattice
gap, resulting an isolated narrow $C=1$ Chern band. From exact diagonalizations
we identify FQAH phases at various fillings. But they exist also in the
calculations with a zero external moir\'e potential. We suggest that the QAH
phase at filling $\nu=1$ in this system should be viewed as an interaction
driven QAH-Wigner crystal, which is then pinned by a small external moir\'e
potential. In the second part we propose a new setup with Coulomb generated
moir\'e superlattice. For example, we separate n-layer graphene and twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG) with a thin hBN and imprint the superlattice of the TBG
to the n-layer graphene. Now the superlattice potential is controlled by the
thickness d of the hBN and the superlattice period is controlled by the twist
angle of the TBG. Overall in both setups the $C=1$ QAH-Wigner crystal is more
robust with a superlattice constant slightly less than 10 nm in 4-layer,
5-layer, 6-layer and 7-layer graphene systems. Our work suggests a new
direction to explore the interplay of topology and FQAH with spontaneous Wigner
crystal formation in the vanishing moir\'e potential limit in hBN aligned and
Coulomb imprinted n-layer graphene superlattice systems.
