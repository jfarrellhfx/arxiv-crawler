<h3>Shell-shaped atomic gases</h3>

We review the quantum statistical properties of two-dimensional shell-shaped
gases, produced by cooling and confining atomic ensembles in thin hollow
shells. We consider both spherical and ellipsoidal shapes, discussing at zero
and at finite temperature the phenomena of Bose-Einstein condensation and of
superfluidity, the physics of vortices, and the crossover from the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The novel
aspects associated to the curved geometry are elucidated in comparison with
flat two-dimensional superfluids. We also describe the hydrodynamic excitations
and their relation with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition for
two-dimensional flat and curved superfluids. In the next years, shell-shaped
atomic gases will be the leading experimental platform for investigations of
quantum many-body physics in curved spatial domains.

<h3>Active actions: effective field theory for active nematics</h3>

Active matter consumes energy from the environment and transforms it into
mechanical work. Notable examples from biology include cell division, bacterial
swarms, and muscle contraction. In this work, we investigate the nature of
active matter systems using the powerful effective field theory toolbox. This
allows us to construct the most general theory without ambiguity up to a given
order in the derivative expansion. Our primary focus is active nematics --
liquid crystal systems that spontaneously break rotational but not
translational symmetry -- in two spatial dimensions. (Such spontaneous symmetry
breaking is allowed if the nematic is embedded in a higher dimensional space.)
While we focus on this one particular class of physical system, the tools
developed here can in principle be applied to any active matter system. Our
theories give unambiguous predictions for the relationship between fluctuations
and equations of motion in the presence of activity, generalizing the standard
fluctuation-dissipation relations characteristic of passive systems.

<h3>Kinetic Ferromagnetism and Topological Magnons of the Hole-Doped Kitaev  Spin Liquid</h3>

We study the effect of hole doping on the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and find
that for ferromagnetic (FM) Kitaev exchange $K$ the system is very susceptible
to the formation of a FM spin polarization. Through density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) simulations on finite systems, we uncover that the
introduction of a single hole with a hopping strength of just $t\sim{}0.28K$ is
enough to disrupt fractionalization and polarize the spins in the [001]
direction due to an order-by-disorder mechanism. Taking into account a material
relevant FM anisotropic spin exchange $\varGamma$ drives the polarization
towards the [111] direction via a reorientation transition into a topological
FM state with chiral magnon excitations. We develop a parton mean-field theory
incorporating fermionic holons and bosonic spinons/magnons, which accounts for
the doping induced FM phases and topological magnon excitations. We discuss
experimental signatures and implications for Kitaev candidate materials.

<h3>Anomalous Linear and Quadratic Nodeless Surface Dirac Cones in  Three-Dimensional Dirac Semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15154</a>

Surface Dirac cones in three-dimensional topological insulators have
generated tremendous and enduring interest for almost two decades owing to
hosting a multitude of exotic properties. In this work, we explore the
topological surface states in two representative types of three-dimensional
Dirac semimetals, and unveil the existence of two types of anomalous surface
Dirac cones on the largely overlooked surfaces where the projections of bulk
Dirac nodes overlap. These surface Dirac cones are found to display a number of
features remarkably different from that in topological insulators. The most
prominent one is the absence of Dirac node in them. In addition, the spin
textures of these nodeless surface Dirac cones are found to exhibit a unique
two-phase-angle dependence, leading to the presence of two different winding
numbers in the orbital-resolved spin textures, which is rather different from
the well-known spin-momentum locking in topological insulators. Despite the
absence of Dirac node, we find that the surface Dirac cones are also
characterized by quantized $\pi$ Berry phases, even though one type of the
surface Dirac cones takes a quadratic dispersion. In the presence of
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking fields, we find that the responses of the
surface and bulk Dirac cones display an interesting bulk-surface
correspondence. The uncovering of these nodeless surface Dirac cones broadens
our understanding of the topological surface states and bulk-boundary
correspondence in Dirac semimetals, and could further fuel the research
interest in Dirac physics.

<h3>Single-hole spectra of Kitaev spin liquids: From dynamical Nagaoka  ferromagnetism to spin-hole fractionalization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15157" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15157</a>

The dynamical response of a quantum spin liquid upon injecting a hole is a
pertinent open question. In experiments, the hole spectral function, measured
momentum-resolved in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or
locally in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), can be used to identify spin
liquid materials. In this study, we employ tensor network methods to simulate
the time evolution of a single hole doped into the Kitaev spin-liquid ground
state and reveal two fundamentally different scenarios. For ferromagnetic spin
couplings, the spin liquid is highly susceptible to hole doping: a Nagaoka
ferromagnet forms dynamically around the doped hole, even at weak coupling. By
contrast, in the case of antiferromagnetic spin couplings, the hole spectrum
demonstrates an intricate interplay between charge, spin, and flux degrees of
freedom, best described by a parton mean-field ansatz of fractionalized holons
and spinons. Moreover, we find a good agreement of our numerical results to the
analytically solvable case of slow holes. Our results demonstrate that
dynamical hole spectral functions provide rich information on the structure of
fractionalized quantum spin liquids.

<h3>Anomalous topology and synthetic flat band in multi-terminal Josephson  Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15159</a>
<br>
<i>Aabir Mukhopadhyay, Udit Khanna, Sourin Das</i>
<br>
<br>
Andreev bound states trapped in a multi-terminal Josephson junction (JJ) can
be assigned a synthetic band topology owing to their periodic dependence on the
Josephson phase bias. We demonstrate that the BdG symmetry adds a twist to this
topological character, i.e., gap closing points may or \textit{may not}
correspond to change of Chern number, hence extending the standard paradigm for
topological bands. We further show that the topology of Andreev bands depends
only on the scattering matrix of the junction and is independent of the
topological nature of superconductors forming the JJ hence indicating a
universal behaviour of multi-terminal JJ. We also show that the chiral
junction, supported by quantum Hall state at the junction region, leads to flat
Andreev bands (implying absence of DC Josephson effects) that are devoid of
Berry curvature ( implying absence of AC Josephson effects). Such electrically
inert JJ may be useful for storage of quantum information in future quantum
devices.

<h3>Symmetries as Ground States of Local Superoperators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15167" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15167</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be
understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators
that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that
these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a
local superoperator, which we refer to as a "super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate
this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the
symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well
as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of
Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show
that this super-Hamiltonian is exactly the superoperator that governs the
operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits. This physical
interpretation provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for
autocorrelation functions, and relates the low-energy excitations of the
super-Hamiltonian to approximate symmetries that determine slowly relaxing
modes in symmetric systems. We find examples of gapped/gapless
super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens
in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we
recover slow-modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in
the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of
quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the
commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of
symmetries and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.

<h3>Transformation of polar nematic phases in the presence of electric field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15250" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15250</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Only a few years have passed since discovery of polar nematics, and now they
are becoming the most actively studied liquid crystal materials. Despite
numerous breakthrough findings made recently, a theoretical systematization is
still lacking. In the present paper we are making a step on the way of
systematization. A powerful technique that molecular-statistical physics is has
been applied to an assembly of polar molecules influenced by electric field.
Totally, the three polar nematic phases were found to be stable at various
conditions: the double-splay ferroelectric nematic $N_F^{2D}$ (observed in the
lower-temperature range in the absence or at low electric field), the
double-splay antiferroelectric nematic $N_{AF}$ (observed at intermediate
temperature in the absence or at low electric field) and the single-splay
ferroelectric nematic $N_F^{1D}$ (observed at moderate electric field at any
temperature below transition into paraelectric nematic $N$ and in the
higher-temperature range (also below $N$) at low electric field or without it.
A paradoxal transition from $N_F^{1D}$ to $N$ induced by application of higher
electric field has been found and explained. A transformation of the structure
of polar nematic phases at application of electric field has also been
investigated by Monte Carlo simulations and experimentally by observation of
POM images. In particular, it has been realized that, at planar anchoring,
$N_{AF}$ in the presence of moderate out-of-plane electric field exhibits the
twofold splay modulation: antiferroelectric in the plane of the substrate and
ferroelectric in the plane normal to the substrate. Several additional
sub-transitions related to fitting confined geometry of the cell by the
structure of polar phases were detected.

<h3>Quantum Monte Carlo pair orbital wave functions for periodic systems  towards the thermodynamical limit: ground states, excitations and spinors</h3>

<br>
We derive many-body single- and multi-reference wave functions for quantum
Monte Carlo of periodic systems with an anti-symmetric portion that explicitly
integrates over the Brillouin zone of one-particle Bloch states. The wave
functions are BCS-like determinants for singlets and pfaffians for polarized
states built with appropriate pair orbitals. This ab initio formalism is
broadly applicable, eg, to description of quasi-particle band gaps, optical
excitations and to systems with complicated Fermi surfaces. It generalizes to
spin-dependent interactions using two-component spinor pairs.

<h3>Lithium plating induced degradation during fast charging of batteries  subjected to compressive loading</h3>

We report the lithium plating associated capacity loss during fast charging
of compressively loaded lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The charging and
discharging of LIB under compressive loading during service may affect the cell
performance or initiate localized defects in the electrodes. Pouch cells of
capacity 20mAh were compressively loaded to nominal pressures of 0-440 kPa and
subjected to 10 cycles of fast charging at 1C and 4C. Experimental results show
that cells charged at 4C-rate experienced significant capacity fade, and
applying compressive loads exacerbated the capacity loss. The coulombic
efficiency study shows that active lithium loss was higher for the initial
cycles before gradually reducing to a minimal capacity loss for the tenth
charging cycle. The cell voltage relaxation immediately after charging was
monitored to identify the stripping of plated lithium after fast charging
cycles and showed that the duration of lithium stripping was higher for cells
under mechanical compressive loading. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) characterization of the
anode showed significantly higher lithium deposits on the anodes charged at a
4C rate under compressive loads. These results indicate that applied mechanical
compression causes increased lithium plating during fast charging of batteries.

<h3>Spin-orbit excitons in a correlated metal: Raman scattering study of  Sr2RhO4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15299</a>
<br>
<i>Lichen Wang, Huimei Liu, Valentin Zimmermann, Arvind Kumar Yogi, Masahiko Isobe, Matteo Minola, Matthias Hepting, Giniyat Khaliullin, Bernhard Keimer</i>
<br>
<br>
Using Raman spectroscopy to study the correlated 4d-electron metal Sr2RhO4,
we observe pronounced excitations at 220 meV and 240 meV with A1g and B1g
symmetries, respectively. We identify them as transitions between the
spin-orbit multiplets of the Rh ions, in close analogy to the spin-orbit
excitons in Mott insulators Sr2IrO4 and $\alpha$-RuCl3. This observation
provides direct evidence for the unquenched spin-orbit coupling in Sr2RhO4. A
quantitative analysis of the data reveals that the tetragonal crystal field
$\Delta$ in Sr2RhO4 has a sign opposite to that in insulating Sr2IrO4, which
enhances the planar xy orbital character of the effective J = 1/2 wavefunction.
This supports a metallic ground state, and suggests that the c-axis compression
of Sr2RhO4 may transform it into a quasi-two dimensional antiferromagnetic
insulator.

<h3>Applications of the Peach-Koehler Force in Liquid Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15315" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15315</a>
<br>
<i>Cheng Long, Jonathan V. Selinger</i>
<br>
<br>
In solids, external stress induces the Peach-Koehler force, which drives
dislocations to move. Similarly, in liquid crystals, an external angular stress
creates an analogous force, which drives disclinations to move. In this work,
we develop a method to calculate the relevant angular stress either
analytically or numerically, and hence to determine the force on a
disclination. We demonstrate this method by applying the Peach-Koehler force
theory to four problems: (a) Single disclination in a liquid crystal cell
between two uniform in-plane alignments perpendicular to each other. (b) Array
of disclinations in a liquid crystal cell with patterned substrates. (c) Pair
of disclinations in a long capillary tube with homeotropic anchoring. (d)
Radial hedgehog or disclination loop inside a sphere with homeotropic
anchoring, and its response to an applied magnetic field. In all of these
problems, the Peach-Koehler force theory predicts the equilibrium defect
structure, and the predictions are consistent with the results of minimizing
the total free energy.

<h3>Atomistic simulations of thermodynamic properties of liquid gallium from  first principles</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the research of condensed matter, atomistic dynamic simulations play a
crucial role, particularly in revealing dynamic processes, phase transitions
and thermodynamic statistics macroscopic physical properties in systems such as
solids and liquids. For a long time, simulating complex and disordered liquids
has been a challenge compared to ordered crystalline structures. The primary
reasons for this challenge are the lack of precise force field functions and
the neglect of nuclear quantum effects. To overcome these two limits in
simulation of liquids, we use a deep potential (DP) with quantum thermal bath
(QTB) approach. DP is a machine learning model are sampled from density
functional theory and able to do large-scale atomic simulations with its
precision. QTB is a method which incorporates nuclear quantum effects by
quantum fluctuation dissipation. The application of this first principles
approach enable us to successfully describe the phase transition processes in
solid and liquid Gallium (Ga) as well as the associated dynamic phenomena. More
importantly, we obtain the thermodynamic properties of liquid Ga, such as
internal energy, specific heat, enthalpy change, entropy and Gibbs free energy,
and these results align remarkably well with experiments. Our research has
opened up a new paradigm for the study of dynamics and thermodynamics in
liquids, amorphous materials, and other disordered systems, providing valuable
insights and references for future investigations.

<h3>Structure and mechanical properties of monolayer amorphous carbon and  boron nitride</h3>

Amorphous materials exhibit various characteristics that are not featured by
crystals and can sometimes be tuned by their degree of disorder (DOD). Here, we
report results on the mechanical properties of monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC)
and monolayer amorphous boron nitride (maBN) with different DOD. The pertinent
structures are obtained by kinetic-Monte-Carlo (kMC) simulations using
machine-learning potentials (MLP) with density-functional-theory (DFT)-level
accuracy. An intuitive order parameter, namely the areal fraction Fx occupied
by crystallites within the continuous random network, is proposed to describe
the DOD. We find that Fx captures the essence of the DOD: Samples with the same
Fx but different sizes and distributions of crystallites have virtually
identical radial distributions functions as well as bond-length and bond-angle
distributions. Furthermore, by simulating the fracture process with molecular
dynamics, we found that the mechanical responses of MAC and maBN before
fracture are solely determined by Fx and are insensitive to the sizes and
specific arrangements of the crystallites. The behavior of cracks in the two
materials is analyzed and found to mainly propagate in meandering paths in the
CRN region and to be influenced by crystallites in distinct ways that toughen
the material. The present results reveal the relation between structure and
mechanical properties in amorphous monolayers and may provide a universal
toughening strategy for 2D materials.

<h3>Perfect Coulomb drag and exciton transport in an excitonic insulator</h3>

Strongly coupled two-dimensional electron-hole bilayers can give rise to
novel quantum Bosonic states: electrons and holes in electrically isolated
layers can pair into interlayer excitons, which can form a Bose-Einstein
condensate below a critical temperature at zero magnetic field. This state is
predicted to feature perfect Coulomb drag, where a current in one layer must be
accompanied by an equal but opposite current in the other, and counterflow
superconductivity, where the excitons form a superfluid with zero viscosity.
Electron-hole bilayers in the strong coupling limit with an excitonic insulator
ground state have been recently achieved in semiconducting transition metal
dichalcogenide heterostructures, but direct electrical transport measurements
remain challenging. Here we use a novel optical spectroscopy to probe the
electrical transport of correlated electron-hole fluids in MoSe2/hBN/WSe2
heterostructures. We observe perfect Coulomb drag in the excitonic insulator
phase up to a temperature as high as ~15K. Strongly correlated electron and
hole transport is also observed at unbalanced electron and hole densities,
although the Coulomb drag is not perfect anymore. Meanwhile, the counterflow
resistance of interlayer excitons remains finite. These results indicate the
formation of an exciton gas in the excitonic insulator which does not
condensate into a superfluid at low temperature. Our work also demonstrates
that dynamic optical spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for probing novel
exciton transport behavior and possible exciton superfluidity in correlated
quantum electron-hole fluids.

<h3>Stochastic Differential Equation for a System Coupled to a Thermostatic  Bath via an Arbitrary Interaction Hamiltonian</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15359</a>

The conventional Langevin equation offers a mathematically convenient
framework for investigating open stochastic systems interacting with their
environment or a bath. However, it is not suitable for a wide variety of
systems whose dynamics rely on the nature of the environmental interaction, as
the equation does not incorporate any specific information regarding that
interaction. Here, we present a universal formulation of the stochastic
differential equation (SDE) for an open system coupled to a thermostatic bath
via an arbitrary interaction Hamiltonian. This SDE encodes the interaction
information to a fictitious potential (mean force) and a position-dependent
damping coefficient. Surprisingly, we find that the conventional Langevin
equation can be recovered in the presence of arbitrary strong interactions
given two conditions: translational invariance of the potential and disjoint
separability of the bath particles. Our results provide a universal framework
for studying open stochastic systems with an arbitrary interaction Hamiltonian
and yield deeper insight into why various experiments fit the conventional
Langevin description regardless of the strength or type of interaction.

The field of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism has been proliferating over
the past few years, with ongoing interests in basic science and potential
applications in spintronic technology. However, a high-resolution spectroscopic
study of the 2D ferromagnet is still lacking due to the small size and air
sensitivity of the exfoliated nanoflakes. Here, we report a thickness-dependent
ferromagnetism in epitaxially grown Cr2Te3 thin films and investigate the
evolution of the underlying electronic structure by synergistic angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray absorption
spectroscopy, and first-principle calculations. A conspicuous ferromagnetic
transition from Stoner to Heisenberg-type is directly observed in the
atomically thin limit, indicating that dimensionality is a powerful tuning knob
to manipulate the novel properties of 2D magnetism. Monolayer Cr2Te3 retains
robust ferromagnetism, but with a suppressed Curie temperature, due to the
drastic drop in the density of states near the Fermi level. Our results
establish atomically thin Cr2Te3 as an excellent platform to explore the dual
nature of localized and itinerant ferromagnetism in 2D magnets.

<h3>Clean realization of the Hund physics near the Mott transition:  $\mathrm{NiS_2}$ under pressure</h3>

Strong correlation effects caused by Hund's coupling have been actively
studied during the past decade. Hund's metal, strongly correlated while far
from the Mott insulating limit, was studied as a representative example.
However, recently, it was revealed that a typical Mott system also exhibits a
sign of Hund physics by investigating the kink structure in the spectral
function of $\mathrm{NiS_{2-x}Se_x}$. Therefore, to understand the Hund physics
in a half-filled multi-orbital system near the metal-insulator transition, we
studied pressure-induced metallic states of $\mathrm{NiS_2}$ by using density
functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. Hund physics, responsible
for suppressing local spin fluctuation, gives low-energy effective
correlations, separated from Mott physics, which suppresses charge fluctuation
at higher energy. This effect is prominent when $J$ becomes comparable to the
quasiparticle kinetic energy, showing apparent scaling behavior of the kink
position $E_{kink} \sim J \cdot Z$. We suggest that the Hund effect can also be
observed in the optical conductivity as a non-Drude-like tail with $1/\omega$
frequency dependence and non-monotonic temperature evolution of the integrated
optical spectral weight at a fixed frequency. Our study demonstrates the
important role of Hund's coupling for electronic correlations even in a
half-filled system.

We have fabricated a 180$^\circ$-twisted bilayer ReSe$_2$ by stacking two
centrosymmetric monolayer ReSe$_2$ flakes in opposite directions, which is
expected to lose spatial inversion symmetry. By the second harmonic generation
and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we successfully observed spatial
inversion symmetry breaking and emergent band dispersions. The band calculation
shows the finite lifting of spin degeneracy (~50 meV) distinct from natural
monolayer and bilayer ReSe$_2$. Our results demonstrate that the spin-momentum
locked state, which leads to spintronic functions and Berry-curvature-related
phenomena, can be realized even with the stacking of centrosymmetric
monolayers.

Seminal Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules provide the inceptive
understanding of the superexchange interaction of two magnetic metal ions
bridged with an anion, and suggest fostered ferromagnetic interaction for
orthogonal bridging bonds. However, there are no examples of two-dimensional
(2D) materials with structure that optimizes the GKA arguments towards enhanced
ferromagnetism and its critical temperature. Here we reveal that an ideally
planar GKA ferromagnetism is indeed stable in selected tetragonal
transition-metal xenes (tTMXs), with Curie temperature above 300~K found in CrC
and MnC. We provide the general orbitally-resolved analysis of magnetic
interactions that supports the claims and sheds light at the mechanisms
dominating the magnetic exchange process in these structures. With recent
advent of epitaxially-grown tetragonal 2D materials, our findings earmark tTMXs
for facilitated spintronic and magnonic applications, or as a desirable
magnetic constituent of functional 2D heterostructures.

direction, in-plane Zeeman coupling strength and moir\'e superlattice potential
can all serve as control parameters to drive these phase transitions. For (001)
oriented Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films, a two dimensional Weyl semimetal phase
protected by $C_{2z} T$ symmetry can be realized using an in-plane magnetic
field, which has recently been reported in our companion paper
[PhysRevLett.131.046601]. We then put forth two pathways to achieve in-plane
anomalous Hall effects (IPAHE). By either introducing a $C_3$-symmetric moir\'e
superlattice potential or altering the growth orientation, the emergent $C_{2z}
T$ symmetry can be broken. Consequently, in the clean limit and at low
temperatures, quantized Hall plateaus induced by in-plane Zeeman fields become
observable.

We study temperature fluctuations in mesoscopic $N$-body systems undergoing
non-equilibrium processes from the perspective of stochastic thermodynamics. By
introducing a stochastic differential equation, we describe the evolution of
the system's temperature during an isothermal process, with the noise term
accounting for finite-size effects arising from random energy transfer between
the system and the reservoir. Our analysis reveals that these fluctuations make
the extensive quantities (in the thermodynamic limit) deviate from being
extensive for consistency with the theory of equilibrium fluctuation. Moreover,
we derive finite-size corrections to the Jarzynski equality, providing insights
into how heat capacity influences such corrections. Also, our results indicate
a possible violation of the principle of maximum work by an amount proportional
to $N^{-1}$. Additionally, we examine the impact of temperature fluctuations in
a finite-size quasi-static Carnot engine. We show that irreversible entropy
production resulting from the temperature fluctuations of the working substance
diminishes the average efficiency of the cycle as $\eta_{\rm{C}}-\left\langle
\eta\right\rangle \sim N^{-1}$, highlighting the unattainability of the Carnot
efficiency $\eta_{\rm{C}}$ for mesoscopic-scale heat engines even under the
quasi-static limit

<br>
Rare-earth (RE) atoms on top of 2D materials represent an interesting
platform with the prospect of tailoring the magnetic anisotropy for practical
applications. Here, we investigate the ground state and magnetic properties of
selected $4f$-atoms deposited on a graphene substrate in the framework of the
DFT+$U$ approach. The inherent strong spin-orbit interaction in conjunction
with crystal field effects acting on the localized $4f$-shells results in a
substantial magnetic anisotropy energy (tens of meVs), whose angular dependence
is dictated by the $C_{6v}$ symmetry of the graphene substrate. We obtain the
crystal field parameters and investigate spin-flip events via quantum tunneling
of magnetization in the view of achieving a protected quantum-spin behavior.
Remarkably, the large spin and orbital moments of the open $4f$-shells (Dy, Ho
and Tm) generate a strong magneto-elastic coupling which provides more
flexibility to control the magnetic state via the application of external
strain.

Ergodicity, a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics, is not yet a
fully understood phenomena for closed quantum systems, particularly its
connection with the underlying chaos. In this review, we consider a few
examples of collective quantum systems to unveil the intricate relationship of
ergodicity as well as its deviation due to quantum scarring phenomena with
their classical counterpart. A comprehensive overview of classical and quantum
chaos is provided, along with the tools essential for their detection.
Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical and experimental advancements in the
domain of ergodicity and its violations. This review aims to illuminate the
classical perspective of quantum scarring phenomena in interacting quantum
systems.

<h3>Large deviations for trajectory observables of diffusion processes in  dimension $d>1$ in the double limit of large time and small diffusion  coefficient</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15542</a>
<br>
<i>Cecile Monthus</i>
<br>
<br>
For diffusion processes in dimension $d>1$, the statistics of trajectory
observables over the time-window $[0,T]$ can be studied via the Feynman-Kac
deformations of the Fokker-Planck generator, that can be interpreted as
euclidean non-hermitian electromagnetic quantum Hamiltonians. It is then
interesting to compare the four regimes corresponding to the time $T$ either
finite or large and to the diffusion coefficient $D$ either finite or small.
(1) For finite $T$ and finite $D$, one needs to consider the full
time-dependent quantum problem that involves the full spectrum of the
Hamiltonian. (2) For large time $T \to + \infty$ and finite $D$, one only needs
to consider the ground-state properties of the quantum Hamiltonian to obtain
the generating function of rescaled cumulants and to construct the
corresponding canonical conditioned processes. (3) For finite $T$ and $D \to
0$, one only needs to consider the dominant classical trajectory and its action
satisfying the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, as in the semi-classical WKB
approximation of quantum mechanics. (4) In the double limit $T \to + \infty$
and $D \to 0$, the simplifications in the large deviations in $\frac{T}{D}$ of
trajectory observables can be analyzed via the two orders of limits, i.e.
either from the limit $D \to 0$ of the ground-state properties of the quantum
Hamiltonians of (2), or from the limit of long classical trajectories $T \to
+\infty$ in the semi-classical WKB approximation of (3). This general framework
is illustrated in dimension $d=2$ with rotational invariance.

<br>
<br>
Cyclic polymers display unique physical behaviors in comparison to their
linear counterparts. Theoretical, computational and experimental studies have
revealed that some of their distinctive properties are also observed in charged
variants of cyclic polymers, known as cyclic polyelectrolytes (PEs), especially
in terms of their structural responses to variations in the strength of
electrostatic interactions. In this study, we investigate the impact of cyclic
topology on the conformations of PE chains in dilute good solvent using scaling
analysis and coarse-grained bead-spring molecular dynamics simulations. Our
observations indicate that, in contrast to linear PE chains, cyclic topology
results in more compact conformations at low and intermediate Bjerrum lengths.
Moreover, two structural metrics, asphericity and prolateness, which quantify
deviations from spherical and flat molecular shapes, exhibit non-monotonic
behaviors for cyclic PEs. This stands in contrast to linear PEs, where these
shape characteristics exhibit a monotonic trend with increasing Bjerrum length.
A feasible analytical theory, developed to account for ionic distributions
around cyclic PE chains, suggests that the fundamental difference between
linear and cyclic chain conformations may be attributed to topological effects
influencing long-range electrostatic interactions.

<h3>Correlation of Blocking and Néel Temperatures in Ultra-thin Metallic  Antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
Nonvolatile spintronics-based devices that utilize electron spin both to
store and transport information face a great challenge when scaled to nano
dimensions due to loss of thermal stability and stray field induced disturbance
in closely packed magnetic bits. The potential replacement of ferromagnetic
materials with antiferromagnets may overcome some of these issues owing to the
superior robustness of sublattice spin orientations to magnetic field
disturbance as long as theyare kept well below the N\'eel temperature, which is
hard to measure with conventional methods, especially in the ultrathin limit.
In this work, we have employed spin pumping from a soft ferromagnetic NiFe
layer into widely used ultrathin metallic antiferromagnet Ir20Mn80, FeMn, PtMn,
PdMn or NiMn with thicknesses in the 0.7-3 nm range, as a probe to detect
damping enhancement during magnetic phase transitions. Independent measurements
of the blocking temperature with magnetometry reveal that temperature dependent
shifts in the resonance peaks can also be used to measure the blocking
temperature, allowing the analysis of the correlation between the N\'eel and
blocking temperatures in trilayers with permalloy and antiferromagnetic layer
separated by a 3 nm thick spacer layer. The thickness dependent
characterization of thermal stability in antiferromagnets provides a key
element for scalable and ultrafast antiferromagnetic spintronics.

<h3>Enhancing the Josephson diode effect with Majorana bound states</h3>

<br>
<i>Jorge Cayao, Naoto Nagaosa, Yukio Tanaka</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider phase-biased Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling under
external magnetic fields and study the emergence of the Josephson diode effect
in the presence of Majorana bound states. We show that junctions having middle
regions with Zeeman fields along the spin-orbit axis develop a low-energy
Andreev spectrum that is asymmetric with respect to the superconducting phase
difference $\phi=\pi$, which is strongly influenced by Majorana bound states in
the topological phase. This asymmetric Andreev spectrum gives rise to anomalous
current-phase curves and critical currents that are different for positive and
negative supercurrents, thus signaling the emergence of the Josephson diode
effect. While this effect exists even without Majorana states, it gets enhanced
in the topological phase as Majorana bound states become truly zero modes. Our
work thus establishes the utilization of topological superconductivity for
enhancing the functionalities of Josephson diodes.

<h3>Regulating spin dynamics in magnetic nanomaterials</h3>

Magnetic nanomaterials can be used in the construction of devices for
information processing and memory storage. For this purpose, they have to enjoy
two contradictory properties, from one side being able of keeping for long time
magnetization frozen, hence information stored, and from the other side
allowing for quick change of magnetization required for fast erasing of memory
and rewriting new information. Methods of resolving this dilemma are suggested
based on triggering resonance, dynamic resonance tuning, and on quadratic
Zeeman effect. These methods make it possible to realize effective regulation
of spin dynamics in such materials as magnetic nanomolecules and magnetic
nanoclusters.

<h3>Impact of surface anisotropy on the spin-wave dynamics in thin  ferromagnetic film</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spin-wave dynamics in the thin CoFeB film in Damon-Eshbach geometry are
studied in three cases of boundary conditions -- free boundary conditions,
symmetrical surface anisotropy, and one-sided surface anisotropy. The
analytical model created by Wolfram and De Wames was extended to include
perpendicular surface anisotropy in boundary conditions. Its comparison with
numerical simulations demonstrate perfect agreement between the approaches. The
analysis of the dispersion relation indicates that the presence of surface
anisotropy increases the avoided crossing size between Damon-Eshbach mode and
perpendicular standing modes. Additionally, asymmetrical one-sided surface
anisotropy induces nonreciprocity in the dispersion relation. In-depth analysis
of the avoided crossing size is conducted for systems with different boundary
conditions, different thicknesses, surface anisotropy constant values, and
external magnetic fields. It shows the significant role of the strength of
surface localization of Damon-Eshbach mode and the symmetry of perpendicular
standing modes in the avoided crossing broadening. Interestingly, for specific
set of parameters the interaction between the particular modes can be
suppressed, resulting in a mode crossing. Such a crossing, which occurs only on
one side of the dispersion relation in a one-sided surface anisotropy system,
can be utilized in nonreciprocal devices.

<h3>Microscopic mechanism of structural and volume relaxation below glass  transition temperature in a soda-lime silicate glass revealed by Raman  spectroscopy and its first principle calculations</h3>

<br>
<i>Taisuke Suzuki, Yuya Hamada, Masahiro Shimizu, Shingo Urata, Yasuhiko Shimotsuma, Kiyotaka Miura</i>
<br>
<br>
To elucidate the atomic structure and volume changes of soda-lime silicate
glass annealed below the glass transition temperature (Tg), the experimental
and calculated Raman spectra were compared. By decomposing the calculated Raman
spectra into a specific group of atoms, the Raman peak at 1050 cm-1 corresponds
to bridging oxygen with a small Si-O-Si bond angle. Based on these results, we
found that, during annealing below Tg, a homogenization reaction Q2+Q4->2Q3
proceeds in the early stage of structural relaxation. Then, the Si-O-Si units
with relatively small angles decrease even in the later stages, which means
that ring deformation occurs even after Qn exchange. We clarified how the
experimentally demonstrated decrease in small Si-O-Si angles contributes to
volume shrinkage. We found that decreasing small Si-O-Si angles can expand the
space inside the rings, and Na can be inserted into the ring center.

Advancements in semiconductor fabrication over the past decade have catalyzed
extensive research into all-optical devices driven by exciton-polariton
condensates. Preliminary validations of such devices, including transistors,
have shown encouraging results even under ambient conditions. A significant
challenge still remains for large scale application however: the lack of a
robust solver that can be used to simulate complex nonlinear systems which
require an extended period of time to stabilize. Addressing this need, we
propose the application of a machine-learning-based Fourier Neural Operator
approach to find the solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equations coupled with
extra exciton rate equations. This work marks the first direct application of
Neural Operators to an exciton-polariton condensate system. Our findings show
that the proposed method can predict final-state solutions to a high degree of
accuracy almost 1000 times faster than CUDA-based GPU solvers. Moreover, this
paves the way for potential all-optical chip design workflows by integrating
experimental data.

The cubic perovskite SrFeO$_3$ was recently reported to host hedgehog- and
skyrmion-lattice phases in a highly symmetric crystal structure which does not
support the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions commonly invoked to explain such
magnetic order. Hints of a complex magnetic phase diagram have also recently
been found in powder samples of the single-layer Ruddlesden-Popper analog
Sr$_2$FeO$_4$, so a reinvestigation of the bilayer material Sr$_3$Fe$_2$O$_7$,
believed to be a simple helimagnet, is called for. Our magnetization and
dilatometry studies reveal a rich magnetic phase diagram with at least 6
distinct magnetically ordered phases and strong similarities to that of
SrFeO$_3$. In particular, at least one phase is apparently
multiple-$\mathbf{q}$, and the $\mathbf{q}$s are not observed to vary among the
phases. Since Sr$_3$Fe$_2$O$_7$ has only two possible orientations for its
propagation vector, some of the phases are likely exotic multiple-$\mathbf{q}$
order, and it is possible to fully detwin all phases and more readily access
their exotic physics.

Polymer droplets subjected to a heated environment have significance in
several fields ranging from spray drying and powder formation to surface
coating. In the present work, we investigate the evaporation of a high
viscoelastic modulus aqueous polymeric droplet in an acoustically levitated
environment. Depending on the laser irradiation intensity, we observe
nucleation of a bubble in the dilute regime of polymer concentration, contrary
to the previously observed bubble nucleation in a semi-dilute entangled regime
for low viscoelastic modulus polymer droplets. After the bubble nucleation, a
quasi steady bubble growth occurs depending on the laser irradiation intensity
and concentrations. Our scaling analysis reveals that bubble growth follows
Plesset-Zwick criteria independent of the viscoelastic properties of the
polymer solution. Further, we establish that the onset of bubble growth has an
inverse nonlinear dependence on the laser irradiation intensity. At high
concentrations and laser irradiation intensities, we report the expansion and
collapse of polymer membrane without rupture, indicating the formation of an
interfacial skin with significant strength. The droplet oscillations are
primarily driven by the presence of multiple bubbles and, to some extent, by
the rotational motion of the droplet. Finally, depending on the nature of
bubble growth, different types of precipitate form contrary to the different
modes of atomization observed in low viscoelastic modulus polymer droplets.

The potential of graphene for hydrogen storage, coupled with the established
role of Platinum as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the
spillover effect, makes Pt-functionalized graphene a promising candidate for
near-ambient hydrogen storage. This paper focuses on examining the process of
Pt cluster formation on epitaxial graphene and assesses the suitability of the
system as hydrogen storage material. Scanning tunneling microscopy unveils two
primary pathways for Pt cluster growth. In the initial phase, up to ~1 ML of Pt
coverage, Pt tends to randomly disperse and cover the graphene surface, while
the cluster height remains essentially unchanged. Beyond a coverage of 3 ML,
the nucleation of new layers on existing clusters becomes predominant. Then,
the clusters mainly grow in height. Thermal desorption spectroscopy on
hydrogenated Pt-decorated graphene reveals the presence of multiple hydrogen
adsorption mechanisms, manifested as two Gaussian peaks superimposed on a
linearly increasing background. We attribute the first peak at 150{\deg}C to
hydrogen physisorbed on the surface of Pt clusters. The second peak at
430{\deg}C is attributed to chemisorption of hydrogen on the surface of the
clusters, while the linearly increasing background is assigned to hydrogen
bonded in the bulk of the Pt clusters. These measurements demonstrate the
ability of Pt-functionalized graphene to store molecular hydrogen at
temperatures that are high enough for stable hydrogen binding at room
temperature.

describe the behavior of Josephson junctions for various current and/or voltage
input waveforms, analog or digital, and for any operating temperature below the
critical temperature of the superconducting materials. We show a good agreement
between experimental and simulated IV curves of Josephson junctions, as well as
a relative increase of the grey zone width of an SFQ balanced comparator
between 4 and 20% due to the presence of quasiparticles, for McCumber
parameters comprised between 0.1 and 1, respectively.

Nowadays a wide number of applications based on magnetic materials relies on
the properties arising at the interface between different layers in complex
heterostructures engineered at the nanoscale. In ferromagnetic/heavy metal
multilayers, such as the [Co/Pt]$_N$ and [Co/Pd]$_N$ systems, the magnetic
proximity effect was demonstrated to be asymmetric, thus inducing a magnetic
moment on the Pt(Pd) layer that is typically higher at the top Co/Pt(Pd)
interface. In this work, advanced spectroscopic and imaging techniques were
combined with theoretical approaches to clarify the origin of this asymmetry
both in Co/Pt trilayers and, for the first time, in multilayer systems that are
more relevant for practical applications. The different magnetic moment induced
at the Co/Pt interfaces was correlated to the microstructural features, which
are in turn affected by the growth processes that induce a different
intermixing during the film deposition, thus influencing the interface magnetic
profile.

Classifying skyrmionic textures and extracting magnetic Hamiltonian
parameters are fundamental and demanding endeavors within the field of
two-dimensional (2D) spintronics. By using micromagnetic simulation and machine
learning (ML) methods, we theoretically realize the recognition of nine
skyrmionic textures and the mining of magnetic Hamiltonian parameters from
massive spin texture images in 2D Heisenberg model. For textures
classification, a deep neural network (DNN) trained according to transfer
learning is proposed to distinguish nine different skyrmionic textures. For
parameters extraction, based on the textures generated by different Heisenberg
exchange stiffness (J), Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya strength (D), and anisotropy
constant (K), we apply a multi-input single-output (MISO) deep learning model
(handling with both images and parameters) and a support vector regression
(SVR) model (dealing with Fourier features) to extract the parameters embedded
in the spin textures. The models for classification and extraction both achieve
great results with the accuracy of 98% (DNN),90% (MISO) and 80% (SVR).
Importantly, via our ML methods, the skyrmionic textures with blurred phase
boundaries can be effectively distinguished, and the concluded formation
conditions of various skyrmionic textures, especially the skyrmion crystal, are
consistent with previous reports. Besides, our models demonstrate the mapping
relationship between spin texture images and magnetic parameters, which proves
the feasibility of extracting microscopic mechanisms from experimental images
and has guiding significance for the experiments of spintronics.

<br>
<br>
A plethora of modern technologies rely on permanent magnets for their
operation, including many related to the transition towards a sustainable
future, such as wind turbines or electric vehicles. Despite the overwhelming
superiority of magnets based on rare-earth elements in terms of the magnetic
performance, the harmful environmental impact of the mining of these raw
materials, their uneven distribution on Earth and various political conflicts
among countries leave no option but seeking for rare-earth-free alternatives.
The family of the hexagonal ferrites or hexaferrites, and in particular the
barium and strontium M-type ferrites (BaFe12O19 and SrFe12O19), are strong
candidates for a partial rare-earth magnets substitution, and they are indeed
successfully implemented in multiple applications. The manufacturing of
hexaferrites into dense pieces (i.e. magnets) meeting the requirements of the
specific application (e.g. magnetic and mechanical properties, shape) is not
always straightforward, which has in many cases hampered the actual
substitution at the industrial level. Here, past and on-going research on
hexaferrites sintering is reviewed with a historical perspective, focusing on
the challenges encountered and the solutions explored, and correlating the
sintering approaches with the magnetic performance of the resulting ceramic
magnet.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the impact of impurity scattering on a generalized version of
the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency
detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is non-zero. Considering
a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) to unravel the dependence of the
associated complex correlation function on the strength of intra- and internode
scattering, frequency detuning and energy difference between the two Weyl
nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the optical response acquires
Drude-like features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective
scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the response in
presence of strong internode scattering if the latter has a fixed
proportionality factor to the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the
frequency detuning, we also find the imaginary part of the response function to
be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE-like" form, although the real part of the
response function is in general finite, and the total optical response
oscillates with time due to the finite frequency offset. We finally conclude
with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.

<h3>Surface superconductor-insulator transition: Reduction of the critical  electric field by Hartree-Fock potential</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, a surface superconductor-insulator transition has been predicted
for a bulk superconductor in an electric field applied perpendicular to its
surface. The related calculations were performed within a one-dimensional
Hubbard model by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations
without the Hartree-Fock (HF) interaction potential. The phase diagram of the
surface superconducting, metallic, and insulating states was obtained as
dependent on the electric field and temperature. This diagram was found to be
in agreement with experimental results reported previously for (Li,Fe)OHFeSe
thin flakes. In the present work, by taking into account the HF potential, we
find that the latter acts as a kind of an extra electrostatic potential that
enhances the electric-field effects on the surface states. The qualitative
features of the phase diagram remain the same but the surface
superconductor-insulator transition occurs at significantly lower electric
fields, which supports prospects of its experimental observation in bulk
samples.

<h3>Structural routes to stabilise superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at  ambient pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
The bilayer perovskite La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has recently been found to enter a
superconducting state under hydrostatic pressure at temperatures as high as
80~K. The onset of superconductivity is observed concurrent with a structural
transition which suggests that superconductivity is inherently related to this
specific structure. Here we perform density functional theory based structural
relaxation calculations and identify several promising routes to stabilise the
crystal structure which hosts the superconducting state at ambient pressure. We
find that the structural transition is controlled almost entirely by a
reduction of the $b$-axis lattice constant, which suggests that uniaxial
compression along the [010] direction or in-plane biaxial compression are
sufficient as tuning parameters to control this transition. Furthermore, we
show that increasing the size of the A-site cations can also induce the
structural transitions via chemical pressure and identify Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and
Ba$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as potential candidates for a high temperature
superconducting nickelate at ambient pressure.

Two-dimensional honeycomb antiferromagnet becomes an important class of
materials as it can provide a route to Kitaev quantum spin liquid,
characterized by massive quantum entanglement and fractional excitations. The
signatures of its proximity to Kitaev quantum spin liquid in the honeycomb
antiferromagnet includes anisotropic bond-dependent magnetic responses and
persistent fluctuation by frustration in paramagnetic regime. Here, we propose
Cu3Co2SbO6 heterostructures as an intriguing honeycomb antiferromagnet for
quantum spin liquid, wherein bond-dependent and frustrated spins interact with
optical excitons. This system exhibits antiferromagnetism at 16 K with
different spin-flip magnetic fields between a bond-parallel and
bond-perpendicular directions, aligning more closely with the generalized
Heisenberg-Kitaev than the XXZ model. Optical spectroscopy reveals a strong
excitonic transition coupled to the antiferromagnetism, enabling optical
detection of its spin states. Particularly, such spin-exciton coupling presents
anisotropic responses between bond-parallel and bond-perpendicular magnetic
field as well as a finite spin-spin correlation function around 40 K, higher
than twice its N\'eel temperature. The characteristic temperature that remains
barely changed even under strong magnetic fields highlights the robustness of
the spin-fluctuation region. Our results demonstrate Cu3Co2SbO6 as a unique
candidate for the quantum spin liquid phase, where the spin Hamiltonian and
quasiparticle excitations can be probed and potentially controlled by light.

<h3>Kitaev chain in an alternating quantum dot-Andreev bound state array</h3>

We propose to implement a Kitaev chain based on an array of alternating
normal and superconductor hybrid quantum dots embedded in semiconductors. In
particular, the orbitals in the dot and the Andreev bound states in the hybrid
are now on equal footing and both emerge as low-energy degrees of freedom in
the Kitaev chain, with the couplings being induced by direct tunneling. Due to
the electron and hole components in the Andreev bound state, this coupling is
simultaneously of the normal and Andreev types, with their ratio being tunable
by varying one or several of the experimentally accessible physical parameters,
e.g., strength and direction of the Zeeman field, as well as changing proximity
effect on the normal quantum dots. As such, it becomes feasible to realize a
two-site Kitaev chain in a simple setup with only one normal quantum dot and
one hybrid segment. Interestingly, when scaling up the system to a three-site
Kitaev chain, next-nearest-neighbor couplings emerge as a result of high-order
tunneling, lifting the Majorana zero energy at the sweet spot. This energy
splitting is mitigated in a longer chain, approaching topological protection.
Our proposal has two immediate advantages: obtaining a larger energy gap from
direct tunneling and creating a Kitaev chain using a reduced number of quantum
dots and hybrid segments.

A mathematical approach is adopted for optimizing the number of total device
elements required for obtaining high effective quantized resistances in
graphene-based quantum Hall array devices. This work explores an analytical
extension to the use of star-mesh transformations such that fractal-like, or
recursive, device designs can yield high enough resistances (like 1 E{\Omega},
arguably the highest resistance with meaningful applicability) while still
being feasible to build with modern fabrication techniques. Epitaxial graphene
elements are tested, whose quantized Hall resistance at the nu=2 plateau (R_H =
12906.4 {\Omega}) becomes the building block for larger effective, quantized
resistances. It is demonstrated that, mathematically, one would not need more
than 200 elements to achieve the highest pertinent resistances

<h3>Feshbach resonance in a strongly repulsive bilayer model: a possible  scenario for bilayer nickelate superconductors</h3>

Since the discovery of superconductivity in cuprate materials, the minimal
ingredients for high-T$_c$ superconductivity have been an outstanding puzzle.
Motivated by the recently discovered nickelate bilayer superconductor
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_3$ under pressure, we study a minimal bilayer model, in which,
as in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_3$, inter- and intralayer magnetic interactions but no
interlayer hopping are present: a mixed-dimensional (mixD) $t-J$ model. In the
setting of a mixD ladder, we show that the system exhibits a crossover
associated with a Feshbach resonance: from a closed-channel dominated regime of
tightly bound bosonic pairs of holes to an open-channel dominated regime of
spatially more extended Cooper pairs. The crossover can be tuned by varying
doping, or by a nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V$ that we include in our
model. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and
analytical descriptions of both regimes, we find that the ground state is a
Luther-Emery liquid, competing with a density wave of tetraparton plaquettes at
commensurate filling $\delta=0.5$ at large repulsion, and exhibits a pairing
dome where binding is facilitated by doping. Our observations can be understood
in terms of pairs of correlated spinon-chargon excitations constituting the
open channel, which are subject to attractive interactions mediated by the
closed channel of tightly bound chargon-chargon pairs. When the closed channel
is lowered in energy by doping or tuning $V$, a Feshbach resonance is realized,
associated with a dome in the binding energy. Our predictions can be directly
tested in state-of-the art quantum simulators, and we argue that the pairing
mechanism we describe may be realized in the nickelate bilayer superconductor
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_3$.

<h3>Modified Enskog equation for hard rods</h3>

We point out that Percus's collision integral for hard rods [J. K. Percus,
Physics of Fluids 12, 1560-1563 (1969)] does not preserve the thermal
equilibrium state in an external trapping potential. We derive a modified
Enskog equation for hard rods and show that it preserves this thermal state
exactly. In contrast to recent proposed kinetic equations for dynamics in
integrability-breaking traps, both our kinetic equation and its thermal states
are explicitly nonlocal in space. Our equation differs from earlier proposals
at third order in spatial derivatives and we attribute this discrepancy to the
molecular chaos assumption underlying our approach.
