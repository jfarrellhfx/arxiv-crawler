<h3>Topological properties in one-dimensional excitonic model: Effects of  charge transfer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18299</a>
<br>
<i>Jianhua Zhu, Wei Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
We have computed the topological phases (the Zak phase) for a one-dimensional
excitonic model. The model takes into account both the dimerisation effects and
the locally excited and charge-transfer states. There are four hopping
parameters, which can be varied to give rise to a rich spectrum of physics. By
studying the one-parameter model (only turning on one parameter), we can find
topologically non-trivial phases. By turning on more than one parameters, we
can find exotic fractional phases, which might be due to symmetry breaking. The
flat bands, depending on the number of parameters turned on, would consist of
two or four charge-transfer excitons that are not coupled in the Hamiltonian.

<h3>A multiscale generative model to understand disorder in domain  boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18325</a>
<br>
<i>Jiadong Dan, Moaz Waqar, Ivan Erofeev, Kui Yao, John Wang, Stephen J. Pennycook, N. Duane Loh</i>
<br>
<br>
A continuing challenge in atomic resolution microscopy is to identify
significant structural motifs and their assembly rules in synthesized materials
with limited observations. Here we propose and validate a simple and effective
hybrid generative model capable of predicting unseen domain boundaries in a
potassium sodium niobate thin film from only a small number of observations,
without expensive first-principles calculation. Our results demonstrate that
complicated domain boundary structures can arise from simple interpretable
local rules, played out probabilistically. We also found new significant
tileable boundary motifs and evidence that our system creates domain boundaries
with the highest entropy. More broadly, our work shows that simple yet
interpretable machine learning models can help us describe and understand the
nature and origin of disorder in complex materials.

<h3>Perturbative Page Curve Induced by External Impulse</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18329" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18329</a>
<br>
<i>Pengfei Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we extend the recent study of entropy dynamics induced by an
external impulse in open quantum systems, where the entropy response follows
the Page curve. For small system-bath coupling $\kappa$, we expect that the
entropy first increases exponentially $\kappa^2 e^{\varkappa t}$ in the
early-time regime $t\lesssim |\log \kappa|$ due to quantum many-body chaos, and
then decreases as $~e^{-\lambda_0 t}$ with $\lambda_0 \propto \kappa^2$ due to
the energy relaxation. These results are confirmed through explicit
calculations using two methods: 1) generalized Boltzmann equation for systems
with quasi-particles; 2) scramblon effective theory in the early-time regime
and perturbation theory in the late-time regime for 0+1-d systems. We also
prove that in the second stage, the entropy of the system is equal to the
coarse-grained entropy.

<h3>Kinetics of Graphene Growth on Liquid Copper by Chemical Vapor  Deposition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18331</a>

<i>Valentina Belova, Hao Gao, Wissal Sghaier, Anastasios Manikas, Mehdi Saedi, Hendrik H. Heenen, Costas Galiotis, Gilles Renaud, Oleg V. Konovalov, Irene M. N. Groot, Karsten Reuter, Maciej Jankowski</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a combined experimental and computational study of the kinetics of
graphene growth during chemical vapor deposition on a liquid copper catalyst.
The use of liquid metal catalysts offers bright perspectives for controllable
large-scale, high-quality synthesis technologies of two-dimensional materials.
We carried out a series of growth experiments varying CH4-to-H2 pressure ratios
and deposition temperature. By monitoring the graphene flake morphology in real
time during growth using in situ optical microscopy in radiation mode, we
explored the morphology and kinetics of the growth within a wide range of
experimental conditions. Following an analysis of the flakes' growth rates, we
conclude that the growth mode was attachment-limited. The attachment and
detachment activation energies of carbon species are derived as 1.9 +- 0.3 eV
and 2.0 +- 0.1 eV, respectively. We also conducted free-energy calculations by
a moment tensor potential trained to density functional theory data. Our
simulations propose that carbon dimers are most likely the active carbon
species during growth, with attachment and detachment barriers of 1.71 +- 0.15
eV and 2.09 +- 0.02 eV, respectively, being in good agreement with the
experimental results.

<h3>Dynamics of quasiholes and quasiparticles at the edges of small lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18364" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18364</a>

<br>
<br>
We study quench dynamics of bosonic fractional quantum Hall systems in small
lattices with cylindrical boundary conditions and low particle density. The
states studied have quasiholes or quasiparticles relative to the bosonic
Laughlin state at half filling. Pinning potentials are placed at edge sites (or
sites close to the edges) and are then turned off. Because the edges of
fractional quantum Hall systems host chiral edge modes, we expect chiral
dynamics, with motion in one direction for positive potentials pinning
quasiholes, and motion in the other direction for negative potentials pinning
quasiparticles. We numerically show that chiral motion of the density
distribution is observed and robust for the case with positive potentials
(quasiholes), but that there is no noticeable chiral motion for negative
potentials (quasiparticles). The comparison of the numerical ground states with
model lattice Laughlin wavefunctions suggests that both positive and negative
potentials do create and pin anyons that are not necessarily well-separated on
small lattices. Initializing the dynamics with the model state also shows the
lack of chiral dynamics of quasiparticles. Our results suggest that, in small
lattices with low particle density, quasiparticles are strongly adversely
affected in dynamical processes, whereas quasiholes are dynamically robust.

<h3>Influence of higher order electron-phonon interaction terms on the  thermal properties of 2D Dirac crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18369" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18369</a>
<br>
<i>Sina Kazemian, Giovanni Fanchini</i>
<br>
<br>
To understand the essential properties of Dirac crystals, such as their
thermal conductivity, we require models that consider the interaction between
Dirac electrons and dispersive acoustic phonons. The exceptionally high thermal
conductivity in 2D Dirac crystals is attributed to near-ideal phonon quantum
gases, while undesired limitations arise from electron-phonon (e-ph)
interactions which have been shown to limit the thermal conductivity up to
several microns away. The e-ph thermal conductivity is directly linked to the
phonon scattering rate. Conventional calculations overlook phonons with
short-dispersive wavelengths, rendering them inadequate for analyzing 2D Dirac
crystals. The phonon scattering rate is typically calculated up to the
first-order magnitude, considering 3-particle interactions involving the decay
of an electron and phonon (EP-E*) to create a new electron. However, processes
involving the decay of an electron and the creation of a new electron and
phonon (E-E*P*) are neglected. In this study, we present an accurate expression
for the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity in 2D Dirac
crystals, accounting for short-dispersive wavelength phonons. We demonstrate
the significance of the E-E*P* process even at room temperature in calculating
the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity, particularly for
first-order e-ph interactions. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of
incorporating second-order e-ph interactions, specifically the EP-E*P*
interaction involving the decay of an electron and phonon and the creation of a
new electron-phonon pair, to accurately determine the phonon scattering rate
and e-ph thermal conductivity at high temperatures and low Fermi energies. This
4-particle interaction process plays a crucial role in characterizing these
properties effectively.

<h3>The nonequilibrium evolution near the phase boundary</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18468" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18468</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaobing Li, Yuming Zhong, Ranran Guo, Mingmei Xu, Jinghua Fu, Yuanfang Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the nonequilibrium evolution near the phase boundary of the 3D Ising
model, and find that the average of relaxation time (RT) near the first-order
phase transition line (1st-PTL) is significantly larger than that near the
critical point (CP). As the system size increases, the average of RT near the
1st-PTL increases at a higher power compared to that near the CP. We further
show that RT near the 1st-PTL is not only non-self-averaging, but actually
self-diverging: relative variance of RT increases with system size. The
presence of coexisting and metastable states results in a substantial increase
in randomness near the 1st-PTL, making it difficult to achieve equilibrium.

<h3>Inverse spin-Hall effect and spin-swapping in spin-split superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18525</a>
<br>
<i>Lina Johnsen Kamra, Jacob Linder</i>
<br>
<br>
When a spin-splitting field is introduced to a thin film superconductor, the
spin currents polarized along the field couples to energy currents that can
only decay via inelastic scattering. We study spin and energy injection into
such a superconductor where spin-orbit impurity scattering yields inverse
spin-Hall and spin-swapping currents. We show that the combined presence of a
spin-splitting field, superconductivity, and inelastic scattering gives rise to
a renormalization of the spin-Hall and spin-swap angles. In addition to an
enhancement of the ordinary inverse spin-Hall effect, spin-splitting gives rise
to unique inverse spin-Hall and spin-swapping signals five orders of magnitude
stronger than the ordinary inverse spin-Hall signal. These can be completely
controlled by the orientation of the spin-splitting field, resulting in a
long-range charge and spin accumulations detectable much further from the
injector than in the normal-state. Our results demonstrate that superconductors
provide tunable inverse spin-Hall and spin-swapping signals with high detection
sensitivity.

<h3>Distinct Floquet topological classifications from color-decorated  frequency lattices with space-time symmetries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18532" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18532</a>
<br>
<i>Ilyoun Na, Jack Kemp, Robert-Jan Slager, Yang Peng</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider nontrivial topological phases in Floquet systems using unitary
loops and stroboscopic evolutions under a static Floquet Hamiltonian $H_F$ in
the presence of dynamical space-time symmetries $G$. While the latter has been
subject of out-of-equilibrium classifications that extend the ten-fold way and
systems with additional crystalline symmetries to periodically driven systems,
we explore the anomalous topological zero modes that arise in $H_F$ from the
coexistence of a dynamical space-time symmetry $M$ and antisymmetry $A$ of $G$,
and classify them using a frequency-domain formulation. Moreover, we provide an
interpretation of the resulting Floquet topological phases using a frequency
lattice with a decoration represented by color degrees of freedom on the
lattice vertices. These colors correspond to the coefficient $N$ of the group
extension $\tilde{G}$ of $G$ along the frequency lattice, given by $N=Z\rtimes
H^1[A,M]$. The distinct topological classifications that arise at different
energy gaps in its quasi-energy spectrum are described by the torsion product
of the cohomology group $H^{2}[G,N]$ classifying the group extension.

<h3>Majorana Loop Models for Measurement-Only Quantum Circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18559" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18559</a>
<br>
<i>Kai Klocke, Michael Buchhold</i>
<br>
<br>
Projective measurements in random quantum circuits lead to a rich breadth of
entanglement phases and extend the realm of non-unitary quantum dynamics. Here
we explore the connection between measurement-only quantum circuits in one
spatial dimension and the statistical mechanics of loop models in two
dimensions. While Gaussian Majorana circuits admit a microscopic mapping to
loop models, for non-Gaussian, i.e., generic Clifford, circuits a corresponding
mapping may emerge only on a coarse grained scale. We then focus on a
fundamental symmetry of loop models: the orientability of world lines. We
discuss how orientability enters in the measurement framework, acting as a
separatrix for the universal long-wavelength behavior in a circuit. When
orientability is broken, the circuit falls into the universality class of
closely packed loops with crossings (CPLC) and features a Goldstone phase with
a peculiar, universal $\log^2(L)$-scaling of the entanglement entropy. In turn,
when orientability is preserved, the long-wavelength behavior of the circuit
mimics that of (coupled) two-dimensional Potts models. We demonstrate the
strength of the loop model approach by numerically simulating a variety of
measurement-only Clifford circuits. Upon varying the set of measured operators,
a rich circuit dynamics is observed, ranging from CPLC to the $1$-state Potts
model (percolation), the $2$-state Potts model (Ising) and coupled Potts models
(BKT) universality class. Loop models thus provide a handle to access a large
class of measurement-only circuits and yield a blueprint on how to realize
desired entanglement phases by measurement.

<h3>Point Defects in Two-Dimensional RuCl3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18560" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18560</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Defects are crucial in determining a variety of material properties
especially in low dimensions. In this work, we study point defects in monolayer
alpha-phase Ruthenium (III) chloride (alpha-RuCl3), a promising candidate to
realize quantum spin liquid with nearly degenerate magnetic states. Our
first-principles simulations reveal that Cl vacancies, Ru vacancies, and oxygen
substitutional defects are the most energetically stable point defects.
Besides, these point defects break the magnetic degeneracy: Cl vacancies and
oxygen substitutional defects energetically favor the zigzag-antiferromagnetic
configuration while Ru vacancies favor the ferromagnetic configuration,
shedding light on understanding the observed magnetic structures and further
defect engineering of magnetism in monolayer {\alpha}-RuCl3. We further
calculated their electronic structures and optical absorption spectra. The
polarization symmetry of optical responses provides a convenient signature to
identify the point defect types and long-range magnetic orders.

<h3>Spin-Hall Current and Nonlocal Transport in Ferromagnet-Free Multi-band  models for Sr Ti O_3-Based Nanodevices in the presence of impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18588" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18588</a>
<br>
<i>Domenico Giuliano, Andrea Nava, Carmine Antonio Perroni, Manuel Bibes, Felix Trier, Marco Salluzzo</i>
<br>
<br>
We compute the spin-Hall conductance in a multiband model describing the
two-dimensional electron gas formed at a LaAlO_3/SrTiO_3 interface in the
presence of a finite concentration of impurities. Combining linear response
theory with a systematic calculation of the impurity contributions to the
self-energy, as well as to the vertex corrections of the relevant diagrams, we
recover the full spin-Hall vs. sheet conductance dependence of LaAlO_3/SrTiO_3
as reported in [Nano Lett. 20, 395 (2020)], finding a very good agreement with
the experimental data below and above the Lifshitz transition. In particular,
we demonstrate that the multiband electronic structure leads to only a partial,
instead of a complete, screening of the spin-Hall conductance, which decreases
with increasing the carrier density. Our method can be generalized to other
two-dimensional systems characterized by a broken inversion
symmetry and multiband physics.

<h3>Quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18626" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18626</a>
<br>
<i>Ashley M. Cook</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the problem of magnetic charges in $(2+1)$ dimensions for a torus
geometry in real-space, subjected to an inverted Lorentz force due to an
external electric field applied normal to the surface of the torus. We compute
the Hall conductivity associated with transport of these charges for the case
of negligible gapless excitations and global $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge
conservation symmetry, and find it is proportional to an integer-valued
topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, corresponding to a magnetic quantum Hall
effect (MQHE). We identify a lattice model realizing this physics in the
absence of an external electric field. Based on this, we identify a
generalization of the MQHE to be quantized transport of magnetic skyrmions, the
quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE), with a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ easy-plane
anisotropy of magnetic skyrmions and effective conservation of charge
associated with magnetic skyrmions yielding incompressibility, provided a
hierarchy of energy scales is respected. As the lattice model may be
characterized both by a total Chern number and the topological invariant
$\mathcal{Q}$, we furthermore outline a possible field theory for electric
charges, magnetic charges, and correlations between magnetic and electric
charges approximated as composite particles, on a two-torus, to handle the
scenario of intermediate-strength correlations between electric and magnetic
charges modeled as composite particles. We map this problem to a generalized
$(4+1)$D theory of the quantum Hall effect for the composite particles.

<h3>Higher-dimensional spin selectivity in chiral crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18637" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18637</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
This study aims to investigate the interplay between chiral-induced
spin-orbit coupling along the screw axis and antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling
(ASOC) in the normal plane within a chiral crystal, using both general model
analysis and first-principles simulations of InSeI, a chiral van der Waals
crystal. While chiral molecules of light atoms typically exhibit spin
selectivity only along the screw axis, chiral crystals with heavier atoms can
have strong ASOC effects that influence spin-momentum locking in all
directions. The resulting phase diagram of spin texture shows the potential for
controlling phase transition and flipping spin by reducing symmetry through
surface cleavage, thickness reduction or strain. We also experimentally
synthesized high-quality InSeI crystals of the thermodynamically stable achiral
analogue which showed exposed (110) facets corresponding to single-handed
helices to demonstrate the potential of material realization for
higher-dimensional spin selectivity in the development of spintronic devices.

<h3>Pyqcm: An open-source Python library for quantum cluster methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18643</a>

<i>Théo N. Dionne, Alexandre Foley, Moïse Rousseau, David Sénéchal</i>
<br>
<br>
Pyqcm is a Python/C++ library that implements a few quantum cluster methods
with an exact diagonalization impurity solver. Quantum cluster methods are used
in the study of strongly correlated electrons to provide an approximate
solution to Hubbard-like models. The methods covered by this library are
Cluster Perturbation Theory (CPT), the Variational Cluster Approach (VCA) and
Cellular (or Cluster) Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT). The impurity solver
(the technique used to compute the cluster's interacting Green function) is
exact diagonalization from sparse matrices, using the Lanczos algorithm and
variants thereof. The core library is written in C++ for performance, but the
interface is in Python, for ease of use and inter-operability with the
numerical Python ecosystem. The library is distributed under the GPL license.

<h3>Light-induced weak ferromagnetism through nonlinear magnonic  rectification</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18656" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18656</a>
<br>
<i>Tom Kahana, Dominik M. Juraschek</i>
<br>
<br>
Rectification describes the generation of a quasistatic component from an
oscillating field, such as an electric polarization in optical rectification,
or a structural distortion in nonlinear phononic rectification. Here, we
present a third fundamental process for magnetization, in which spin precession
is rectified along the coordinates of a nonlinearly driven magnon mode in an
antiferromagnet. We demonstrate theoretically that a quasistatic magnetization
can be induced by transient spin canting in response to the coherent excitation
of a chiral phonon mode that produces an effective magnetic field for the
spins. This mechanism, which we call nonlinear magnonic rectification, is
generally applicable to magnetic systems that exhibit degenerate chiral phonon
modes. Our result serves as an example of light-induced weak ferromagnetism and
provides a promising avenue to creating nonequilibrium spin configurations.

<h3>Local step-flow dynamics in thin film growth with desorption</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18661</a>

<br>
<br>
Desorption of deposited species plays a role in determining the evolution of
surface morphology during crystal growth when the desorption time constant is
short compared to the time to diffuse to a defect site, step edge or kink.
However, experiments to directly test the predictions of these effects are
lacking. Novel techniques such as \emph{in-situ} coherent X-ray scattering can
provide significant new information. Herein we present X-ray Photon Correlation
Spectroscopy (XPCS) measurements during diindenoperylene (DIP) vapor deposition
on thermally oxidized silicon surfaces. DIP forms a nearly complete
two-dimensional first layer over the range of temperatures studied (40 - 120
$^{\circ}$C), followed by mounded growth during subsequent deposition. Local
step flow within mounds was observed, and we find that there was a
terrace-length-dependent behavior of the step edge dynamics. This led to
unstable growth with rapid roughening ($\beta>0.5$) and deviation from a
symmetric error-function-like height profile. At high temperatures, the grooves
between the mounds tend to close up leading to nearly flat polycrystalline
films. Numerical analysis based on a 1 + 1 dimensional model suggests that
terrace-length dependent desorption of deposited ad-molecules is an essential
cause of the step dynamics, and it influences the morphology evolution.

<h3>Observation of non-Hermitian topology in a multi-terminal quantum Hall  device</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum devices characterized by non-Hermitian topology are predicted to show
highly robust and potentially useful properties, but realizing them has
remained a daunting experimental task. This is because non-Hermiticity is often
associated with gain and loss, which would require precise tailoring to produce
the signatures of nontrivial topology. Here, instead of gain/loss, we use the
nonreciprocity of the quantum Hall edge states to directly observe
non-Hermitian topology in a multi-terminal quantum Hall ring. Our transport
measurements evidence a robust, non-Hermitian skin effect: currents and
voltages show an exponential profile, which persists also across Hall plateau
transitions away from the regime of maximum non-reciprocity. Our observation of
non-Hermitian topology in a quantum device introduces a scalable experimental
approach to construct and investigate generic non-Hermitian systems.

<h3>Strain Relaxation in Core-Shell Pt-Co Catalyst Nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18686</a>
<br>
<i>Elliot Padgett, Megan E. Holtz, Anusorn Kongkanand, David A. Muller</i>
<br>
<br>
Surface strain plays a key role in enhancing the activity of Pt-alloy
nanoparticle oxygen reduction catalysts. However, the details of strain effects
in real fuel cell catalysts are not well-understood, in part due to a lack of
strain characterization techniques that are suitable for complex supported
nanoparticle catalysts. This work investigates these effects using strain
mapping with nanobeam electron diffraction and a continuum elastic model of
strain in simple core-shell particles. We find that surface strain is relaxed
both by lattice defects at the core-shell interface and by relaxation across
particle shells caused by Poisson expansion in the spherical geometry. The
continuum elastic model finds that in the absence of lattice dislocations,
geometric relaxation results in a surface strain that scales with the average
composition of the particle, regardless of the shell thickness. We investigate
the impact of these strain effects on catalytic activity for a series of Pt-Co
catalysts treated to vary their shell thickness and core-shell lattice
mismatch. For catalysts with the thinnest shells, the activity is consistent
with an Arrhenius dependence on the surface strain expected for coherent strain
in dislocation-free particles, while catalysts with thicker shells showed
greater activity losses indicating strain relaxation caused by dislocations as
well.

<h3>Quantum spin fluctuations and the stability of atomically-sized Bloch  points</h3>

<br>
<br>
We reveal the role of the spin variables' zero-point fluctuations (ZPFs) on
the stability of Bloch point (BP) singularities. As topological solitons, BPs
are important in topological transitions in nanomagnets. BPs present a
singularity at their core, where the long-length-scale approximation fails. We
found that ZPFs bloom nearby this core, reducing the effective magnetic moment
and increasing the BP's stability. As suggested by classical models, the
magnonic eigenmodes found by our methods fit with the bound state of an
electron surrounding a dyon, with a magnetic and an electric charge.

<h3>How Thermal Effect Regulates Cyclic Voltammetry of Supercapacitors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18713" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18713</a>
<br>
<i>Teng Zhao, Shuangliang Zhao, Shenggao Zhou, Zhenli Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a powerful technique for characterizing
electrochemical properties of electrochemical devices. During
charging-discharging cycles, thermal effect has profound impact on its
performance, but existing theoretical models cannot clarify such intrinsic
mechanism and often give poor prediction. Herein, we propose an interfacial
model for the electro-thermal coupling, based on fundamentals in
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. By incorporating molecular interactions,
our model shows a quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. The
integral capacitance shows a first enhanced then decayed trend against the
applied heat bath temperature. Such a relation is attributed to the competition
between electrical attraction and Born repulsion via dielectric inhomogeneity,
which is rarely understood in previous models. In addition, as evidenced in
recent experimental CV tests, our model predicts the non-monotonic dependence
of the capacitance on the bulk electrolyte density, further demonstrating its
high accuracy. This work demonstrates a potential pathway towards
next-generation thermal regulation of electrochemical devices.

This work proposes a semi-empirical model for the SEI growth process during
the early stages of lithium-ion battery formation cycling and aging. By
combining a full-cell model which tracks half-cell equilibrium potentials, a
zero-dimensional model of SEI growth kinetics, and a semi-empirical description
of macroscopic cell expansion, the resulting model replicated experimental
trends measured on a 2.5 Ah pouch cell, including the first-cycle efficiency,
cell thickness changes, and electrolyte reduction peaks during the first charge
dQ/dV signal. This work also introduces an SEI growth boosting formalism which
enables a unified description of SEI growth during both formation cycling and
aging. The model further provides a homogenized representation of
multi-component SEI reactions which enables the study of both solvent and
additive consumption during formation. This work bridges the gap between
electrochemical descriptions of SEI growth and applications towards industrial
battery manufacturing technology where battery formation is an essential but
time-consuming final step. We envision that the formation model can further be
used to predict the impact of formation protocols and electrolyte systems on
SEI passivation and resulting battery longevity.

<br>
<br>
In connection to the chirality induced spin-selectivity (CISS) effect, we
theoretically analyze the electron state of edges of a finite $p$-orbital
helical atomic chain with the intra-atomic spin orbit interaction (SOI). This
model can host the spin-filtering state in which two up spins propagate in one
direction and two down spins propagate in the opposite direction without
breaking the time-reversal symmetry. We found that this model can exhibit the
enhancement of charge density concentrated at the edges due to the evanescent
states induced by the spin and orbital flip by the SOI. Although the spin
density is absent because of the time reversal symmetry of the SOI, the charge
concentration at the edges may play a role in the enantioselective adsorption
of CISS molecules on the ferromagnetic surface.

We develop a numerical method for the time evolution of Gaussian wave packet
on a flat-band lattice in the presence of correlated disorder. We apply this to
the one-dimensional (1D) cross-stitch model. Reasonable agreements with
analytical results from the quantum master equation are found, for the decay
and dephasing process when the flat-band intersects with the dispersive band.
Extending the numerical method to the two dimensional (2D) $\alpha-T_3$ model,
we find the initial flat-band wave packet preserves its localization when
$\alpha = 0$ regardless of disorders and intersections; and it shifts in real
space when $\alpha\neq 0$. We point out a method to generate random on-site
energy with a prescribed correlation, derive the imaginary error function and
the coupled equations of the flat-band and dispersive-band in 1D.

<h3>Non-Hermitian Haldane-Hubbard model: effective description of one and  two-body dissipations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18762" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18762</a>
<br>
<i>Can Wang, Tian-Cheng Yi, Jian Li, Rubem Mondaini</i>
<br>
<br>
Using numerically exact diagonalization, we study the correlated
Haldane-Hubbard model in the presence of dissipation. Such dissipation can be
modeled at short times by the dynamics governed by an effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, of which we present a full characterization. If the dissipation
corresponds to a two-body loss, the repulsive interaction of the effective
Hamiltonian acquires an imaginary component. A competition between the
formation of a charge-ordered Mott insulator state and a topological insulator
ensues, but with the non-Hermitian contribution aiding in stabilizing the
topologically non-trivial regime, delaying the onset of the formation of a
local order parameter. Lastly, we analyze the robustness of the ordered phase
by following the full dissipative many-body real-time dynamics. An
exponentially fast melting of the charge order occurs, whose characteristic
rate is roughly independent of the interaction strength, for the case of
one-body dissipation.

<br>
<br>
We reported the quasiparticle relaxation dynamics of an optimally doped
triclinic iron-based superconductor
(Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ with bulk $T_c$
= 30 K using polarized ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. Our results
reveal anisotropic transient reflectivity induced by nematic fluctuations
develops below $T_{nem}$ $\approx$ 120 K and persists in the superconducting
states. Measurements under high pump fluence reveal three distinct, coherent
phonon modes at frequencies of 1.6, 3.5, and 4.7 THz, corresponding to
$A_{1g}(1)$, $E_g$, and $A_{1g}(2)$ modes, respectively. The high-frequency
$A_{1g}(2)$ mode corresponds to the $c$-axis polarized vibrations of FeAs
planes with a nominal electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda _{A_{1g}(2)}$
$\approx$ 0.139 $\pm$ 0.02. Our findings suggest that the superconductivity and
nematic state are compatible but competitive at low temperatures, and the
$A_{1g}$ phonons play an important role in the formation of Cooper pairs in
(Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$.

<br>
<br>
Layered magnetic materials are becoming a major platform for future
spin-based applications. Particularly the air-stable van der Waals compound
CrSBr is attracting considerable interest due to its prominent
magneto-transport and magneto-optical properties. In this work, we observe a
transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic behavior in CrSBr crystals
exposed to high-energy, non-magnetic ions. Already at moderate fluences, ion
irradiation induces a remanent magnetization with hysteresis adapting to the
easy-axis anisotropy of the pristine magnetic order up to a critical
temperature of 110 K. Structure analysis of the irradiated crystals in
conjunction with density functional theory calculations suggest that the
displacement of constituent atoms due to collisions with ions and the formation
of interstitials favors ferromagnetic order between the layers.

<br>
<br>
Terahertz (THz) time-domain emission spectroscopy was performed on layered
2H-MoSe2 and 2H-WSe2. The THz emission shows an initial cycle attributed to
surge currents and is followed by oscillations attributed to coherent
interlayer phonon modes. To obtain the frequencies of the interlayer
vibrations, analysis of the THz emission waveforms were performed, separating
the two contributions to the total waveform. Results of the fitting show
several vibrational modes in the range of 5.87 to 32.75 cm-1 for the samples,
attributed to infrared-active interlayer shear and breathing modes. This study
demonstrates that THz emission spectroscopy provides a means of observing these
low frequency vibrational modes in layered materials.

<h3>The effect of compression shock heating in collision welding</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
This work discusses the origin of temperature rise during the collision
welding process. The different physical irreversible and reversible mechanisms
which act as heat sources are described: isentropic compression work, shock
dissipation, plasticity, and phase transitions. The temperature increase due to
these effects is quantified in a continuum mechanics approach, and compared to
predictions of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Focusing on a single
impact scenario of 1100 aluminium at 700 m/s, our results indicate that shock
heating and plastic work only effect a temperature rise of 100 K, and that the
effects of phase change are not significant. This temperature rise cannot
explain welding. In consequence, the relevant mechanism which effects bonding
in collision welding must be due to the jet, which is only formed at oblique
impact angles.

<h3>Theoretical bound of the efficiency of learning with coarse-graining</h3>

<br>
<br>
A thermodynamic formalism describing the efficiency of information learning
is proposed, which is applicable for stochastic thermodynamic systems with
multiple internal degree of freedom. The learning rate, entropy production rate
(EPR), and entropy flow from the system to the environment under coarse-grained
dynamics are derived. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality has been applied to
demonstrate the lower bound on the EPR of an internal state. The inequality of
EPR is tighter than the Clausius inequality, leading to the derivative of the
upper bound on the efficiency of learning. The results are verified in cellular
networks with information processes.

The role and impact of spatial heterogeneity in two-dimensional quantum
materials represents one of the major research quests regarding the future
application of these materials in optoelectronics and quantum information
science. In the case of transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, in
particular, direct access to heterogeneities in the dark-exciton landscape with
nanometer spatial and ultrafast time resolution is highly desired, but remains
largely elusive. Here, we introduce ultrafast dark field momentum microscopy to
spatio-temporally resolve dark exciton formation dynamics in a twisted
WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$ heterostructure with 55 femtosecond time- and 500~nm spatial
resolution. This allows us to directly map spatial heterogeneity in the
electronic and excitonic structure, and to correlate these with the dark
exciton formation and relaxation dynamics. The benefits of simultaneous
ultrafast nanoscale dark-field momentum microscopy and spectroscopy is
groundbreaking for the present study, and opens the door to new types of
experiments with unprecedented spectroscopic and spatiotemporal capabilities.

<h3>Local field of spin-spin interactions in the nuclear spin system of  n-GaAs</h3>

<br>
<br>
At low lattice temperatures the nuclear spins in a solid form a closed
thermodynamic system that is well isolated from the lattice. Thermodynamic
properties of the nuclear spin system are characterized by the local field of
spin-spin interactions, which determines its heat capacity and the minimal
achievable nuclear spin temperature in demagnetization experiments. We report
the results of measurement of the local field for the nuclear spin system in
GaAs, which is a model material for semiconductor spintronics. The choice of
the structure, a weakly doped GaAs epitaxial layer with weak residual
deformations, and of the measurement method, the adiabatic demagnetization of
optically cooled nuclear spins, allowed us to refine the value of nuclear
spin-spin local field, which turned out to be two times less than one
previously obtained. Our experimental results are confirmed by calculations,
which take into account dipole-dipole and indirect (pseudodipolar and exchange)
nuclear spin interactions.

<h3>Universal bounds on the performance of information-thermodynamic engine</h3>

<br>
<i>Tomohiro Tanogami, Tan Van Vu, Keiji Saito</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate fundamental limits on the performance of information
processing systems from the perspective of information thermodynamics. We first
extend the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) to a subsystem.
Specifically, for a bipartite composite system consisting of a target system
and an auxiliary system, we show that the relative fluctuation of an arbitrary
current for the target system is lower bounded not only by the entropy
production associated with the target system but also by the information flow
between the two systems. As a direct consequence of this bipartite TUR, we
prove universal trade-off relations between the output power and efficiency of
an information-thermodynamic engine in the fast relaxation limit of the
auxiliary system. In this limit, we further show that the Gallavotti-Cohen
symmetry is satisfied even in the presence of information flow. This symmetry
leads to universal relations between the fluctuations of information flow and
entropy production in the linear response regime. We illustrate these results
with simple examples: coupled quantum dots and coupled linear overdamped
Langevin equations. Interestingly, in the latter case, the equality of the
bipartite TUR is achieved even far from equilibrium, which is a very different
property from the standard TUR. Our results are applicable to a wide range of
systems, including biological systems, and thus provide insight into the design
principles of biological systems.

<h3>Proximity effect of time-reversal symmetry broken non-centrosymmetric  superconductors</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
In non-centrosymmetric superconductors the pair potential has both
even-parity singlet and odd-parity triplet components. If time-reversal
symmetry is broken, the superconducting phase of these components is not the
same, for example in anapole superconductors. In this paper it is shown that
breaking time-reversal symmetry by a phase difference between the two
components significantly alters both the density of states and the conductance
in s+helical p-wave superconductors. The density of states and conductance in
s+chiral p-wave superconductors are less influenced by adding a phase
difference because time reversal symmetry is already broken in the s+p-wave
superconductor. The Tanaka-Nazarov boundary conditions are extended to 3D
superconductors, allowing to investigate a greater variety of superconductors,
such as B-W superconductors, in which the direction of the d-vector is parallel
to the direction of momentum. The results are important for the determination
of pair potentials in potentially time-reversal symmetry broken
non-centrosymmetric superconductors.

<h3>Topological Nanophononic Interface States Using High-Order Bandgaps in  the One-Dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological interface states in periodic lattices have emerged as valuable
assets in the fields of electronics, photonics, and phononics, owing to their
inherent robustness against disorder. Unlike electronics and photonics, the
linear dispersion relation of hypersound offers an ideal framework for
investigating higher-order bandgaps. In this work, we propose a design strategy
for the generation and manipulation of topological nanophononic interface
states within high-order bandgaps of GaAs/AlAs multilayered structures. These
states arise from the band inversion of two concatenated superlattices that
exhibit inverted spatial mode symmetries around the bandgap. By adjusting the
thickness ratio of the unit cells in these superlattices, we are able to
engineer interface states in different bandgaps, enabling the development of
versatile topological devices spanning a wide frequency range. Moreover, we
demonstrate that such interface states can also be generated in hybrid
structures that combine two superlattices with bandgaps of different orders
centered around the same frequency. These structures open up new avenues for
exploring topological confinement in high-order bandgaps, providing a unique
platform for unveiling and better understanding complex topological systems.

<br>
<br>
We report second-order Raman scattering spectra of copper iodide bulk single
crystals aside from the fundamental TO and LO mode. The spectral shape was
reproduced by a 2-phonon density of states calculated by DFT. Characteristic
multi-phonon features were identified and assigned to combination, overtone and
difference modes. In this way, the energy of acoustic zone-boundary phonons was
determined. The temperature dependence of those modes and the fundamental
optical phonons was analyzed by means of phonon-phonon interactions and lattice
expansion effects up to room temperature. Processes related to the mode energy
shift and width were identified for phonons at high symmetry points. The shifts
due to lattice expansion are in accordance with the predictions by DFT in
quasi-harmonic approximation using PBEsol functional.

We study the non equilibrium Casimir-Lifshitz force between graphene-based
parallel structures held at different temperatures and in presence of an
external thermal bath at a third temperature. The graphene conductivity, which
is itself a function of temperature, as well as of chemical potential, allows
us to tune in situ the Casimir-Lifshitz force. We explore different non
equilibrium configurations while considering different values of the graphene
chemical potential. Particularly interesting cases are investigated, where the
force can change sign going from attractive to repulsive or where the force
becomes non monotonic with respect to chemical potential variations, contrary
to the behaviour under thermal equilibrium.

<br>
<br>
We investigated the high temperature decomposition behavior of wurtzite phase
Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N films using experimental methods and first-principles
calculations. Single phase metastable wurtzite Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N (x = 0.65,
0.75, 085 and 0.95) solid solution films were grown by cathodic arc deposition
using low duty cycle pulsed substrate-bias voltage. First-principles calculated
elastic constants of the wurtzite Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N phase show a strong
dependence on alloy composition. The predicted phase diagram shows a
miscibility gap with an unstable region. High resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy and chemical mapping demonstrate decomposition of the films
after high temperature annealing (950$^{\circ}$C), which resulted in nanoscale
chemical compositional modulations containing Ti-rich and Al-rich regions with
coherent or semi coherent interfaces. This spinodal decomposition of the
wurtzite film causes age hardening of 1-2 GPa.

<br>
<i>Erik Schroedter, Björn Jakob Wurst, Jan-Philip Joost, Michael Bonitz</i>
<br>
<br>
The quantum dynamics of correlated fermionic or bosonic many-body systems
following external excitation can be successfully studied using nonequilibrium
Green functions (NEGF) or reduced density matrix methods. Approximations are
introduced via a proper choice of the many-particle selfenergy or decoupling of
the BBGKY-hierarchy, respectively. These approximations are based on Feynman's
diagram approaches or on cluster expansions into single-particle and
correlation operators. In a recent paper [E. Schroedter, J.-P. Joost, and M.
Bonitz, Cond. Matt. Phys. \textbf{25}, 23401 (2022)] we have presented a
different approach where, instead of equations of motion for the many-particle
NEGF (or density operators), equations for the correlation functions of
fluctuations are analyzed. In particular, we derived the stochastic GW and
polarization approximations that are closely related to the nonequilibrium GW
approximation. Here, we extend this approach to the computation of two-time
observables depending on the specific ordering of the underlying operators. In
particular, we apply this extension to the calculation of the density
correlation function and dynamic structure factor of correlated Hubbard
clusters in and out of equilbrium.

We characterize the equation of state (EoS) of the SU($N>2$) Fermi-Hubbard
Model (FHM) in a two-dimensional single-layer square optical lattice. We probe
the density and the site occupation probabilities as functions of interaction
strength and temperature for $N = 3, 4$ and 6. Our measurements are used as a
benchmark for state-of-the-art numerical methods including determinantal
quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and numerical linked cluster expansion (NLCE). By
probing the density fluctuations, we compare temperatures determined in a
model-independent way by fitting measurements to numerically calculated EoS
results, making this a particularly interesting new step in the exploration and
characterization of the SU($N$) FHM.

Ion irradiation can cause burrowing of nanoparticles in substrates, strongly
depending on the material properties and irradiation parameters. In this study,
we demonstrate that the sinking process can be accomplished with ion
irradiation of cube-shaped Ag nanoparticles on top of silicon; how ion
channeling affects the sinking rate; and underline the importance of the
amorphous state of the substrate upon ion irradiation. Based on our
experimental findings, the sinking process is described as being driven by
capillary forces enabled by ion-induced plastic flow of the substrate.

Synthetic ferrimagnets based on Co and Gd bear promise for directly bridging
the gap between volatile information in the photonic domain and non-volatile
information in the magnetic domain, without the need for any intermediary
electronic conversion. Specifically, these systems exhibit strong spin-orbit
torque effects, fast domain wall motion and single-pulse all-optical switching
of the magnetization. An important open challenge to bring these materials to
the brink of applications is to achieve long-term stability of their magnetic
properties. In this work, we address the time-evolution of the magnetic moment
and compensation temperature of magnetron sputter grown Pt/Co/Gd trilayers with
various capping layers. Over the course of three months, the net magnetic
moment and compensation temperature change significantly, which we attribute to
quenching of the Gd magnetization. We identify that intermixing of the capping
layer and Gd is primarily responsible for this effect, which can be alleviated
by choosing nitrides for capping as long as reduction of nitride to oxide is
properly addressed. In short, this work provides an overview of the relevant
aging effects that should be taken into account when designing synthetic
ferrimagnets based on Co and Gd for spintronic applications.

<h3>Elastic signatures of a spin-nematic</h3>

<br>
<i>Monica Bapna, Subhro Bhattacharjee</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the elastic signatures -- renormalisation of sound velocity and
magnetostriction -- of the spin-nematic phase of a spin-$1$ magnet on a
triangular lattice described by the bilinear-biquadratic spin Hamiltonian. We
show that at low temperatures, the scattering of the acoustic phonons from the
Goldstone modes of the nematic phase lead to a powerlaw renormalisation of the
fractional change in the sound velocity, $v$, as a function of temperature,
$T$, i.e. $\Delta v/v\propto T^3$ as opposed to the same in the high
temperature paramagnet where $\Delta v/v\propto T^{-1}$. At the generically
discontinuous nematic transition, there is a jump in magnetostriction as well
as $\Delta v/v$ along with enhanced $h^4$ dependence on the magnetic field,
$h$, near the nematic transition. These signatures can help positively
characterise the spin-nematic in general and in particular the realisation of
such a phase in the candidate material NiGa$_2$S$_4$.

<br>
<br>
Use of electrode materials that show phase change behavior and hence drastic
changes in electrochemical activity during operation, have not been explored
for Li-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the vanadium oxide (VO2) cathode that
undergoes metal-insulator transition due to first-order structural phase
transition at accessible temperature of 68{\deg}C for battery operation. Using
a suitable electrolyte operable across the phase transition range and
compatible with vanadium oxide cathodes, we studied the effect of electrode
structure change on lithium insertion followed by the electrochemical
characteristics above and below the phase transition temperature. The
high-temperature VO2 phase shows significantly improved capacitance, enhanced
current rate capabilities, improved electrical conductivity and lithium-ion
diffusivity compared to the insulating low temperature phase. This opens up new
avenues for electrode designs, allowing manipulation of electrochemical
reactions around phase transition temperatures, and in particular enhancing
electrochemical properties at elevated temperatures contrary to existing
classes of battery chemistries that lead to performance deterioration at
elevated temperatures.

The unique band structure in topological materials frequently results in
unusual magneto-transport phenomena, one of which is in-plane longitudinal
negative magnetoresistance (NMR) with the magnetic field aligned parallel to
the electrical current direction. This NMR is widely considered as a hallmark
of chiral anomaly in topological materials. Here we report the observation of
in-plane NMR in the topological material ZrTe5 when the in-plane magnetic field
is both parallel and perpendicular to the current direction, revealing an
unusual case of quantum transport beyond the chiral anomaly. We find that a
general theoretical model, which considers the combined effect of Berry
curvature and orbital moment, can quantitatively explain this in-plane NMR. Our
results provide new insights into the understanding of in-plane NMR in
topological materials.

We derive new bounds to the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in the
linear-response regime for steady-state transport in two-terminal systems when
time reversal symmetry (TRS) is broken. We find that such bounds are different
for charge and heat currents and depend on the details of the system, through
the Onsager coefficients, and on the ratio between applied voltage and
temperature difference. As a function of such a ratio, the bounds can take any
positive values. The bounds are then calculated for a hybrid coherent
superconducting system using the scattering approach, and the concrete case of
an Andreev interferometer is explored. Interestingly, we find that the bound on
the charge current is always smaller than 2 when the system operates as a heat
engine, while the bound on the heat current is always larger than 2 when the
system operates as a refrigerator.

The spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a myriad of exotic physical
phenomena, including the possession of three distinct superconducting phases at
ambient pressure for magnetic field $\mu_0 H \leq$ 40 T aligned in certain
orientations. However, contradictory reports between studies performed on
UTe$_2$ specimens of varying quality have severely impeded theoretical efforts
to understand the microscopic properties of this material. Here, we report high
magnetic field measurements on a new generation of ultraclean UTe$_2$
specimens, which possess enhanced superconducting critical temperatures and
fields compared to previous sample generations. Remarkably, for $H$ applied
close to the hard magnetic $b$ direction, we find that the angular extent of
magnetic field-reinforced superconductivity is significantly increased in these
high purity crystals. This suggests that, in proximity to a field-induced
metamagnetic transition, the enhanced role of magnetic fluctuations - that are
strongly suppressed by disorder - is likely responsible for tuning UTe$_2$
between two distinct spin-triplet superconducting phases. Our results reveal a
strong sensitivity to crystalline disorder of the field-reinforced
superconducting state of UTe$_2$.

<h3>Emergent Infrared Conformal Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Quantum  Gases</h3>

Conformal dynamics can appear in quantum gases when the interactions are fine
tuned to be scale symmetric. One well-known example of such a system is a
three-dimensional Fermi gas at a Feshbach resonance. In this letter, we
illustrate how conformal dynamics can also emerge in the infrared limit in
one-dimensional harmonically trapped Fermi gases, even though the system may
not have exactly scale symmetric interactions. The conformal dynamics are
induced by strong renormalization effects due to the nearby infrared stable
scale invariant interaction. When the system approaches the infrared limit, or
when the external harmonic trapping frequency $\omega_f \rightarrow 0$, the
dynamics are characterized by a unique vanishingly small dissipation rate,
$\Gamma \propto \omega_f$, rather than a constant as in generic interacting
systems. We also examine the work done in a two-quench protocol, $W$, and the
average power $\mathcal{P}$. In one dimension, the average power, $\mathcal{P}
\propto \omega_f$, becomes vanishingly small in the infrared limit, a signature
of emergent conformal dynamics.

Powder samples have been suggested as a pathway to fabricate isotropic
magnetoelectric (ME) materials which effectively only have a pseudoscalar or
monopole ME response. We demonstrate that random distribution of ME grains
alone does not warrant isotropic ME response because the activation of a
non-vanishing ME response requires a ME field cooling protocol which tends to
induce preferred axes. We investigate the evolution of ME susceptibility in
powder chromia samples for various ME field cooling protocols both
theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we work out the theoretical
expressions for ME susceptibility for powder Chromia in the framework of
statistical mechanics where Boltzmann factors weigh the orientation of the
N\'eel vector relative to the local orientation of the c-axis of a grain.
Previous approximations oversimplified the thermodynamic nature of the
annealing process giving rise to misleading conclusions on the role of the
magnitude of the applied product of electric and magnetic fields on the ME
response. In accordance with our refined theory, a strong dependence of the
functional form of $\alpha$ vs. $T$ of Chromia powders on the ME field cooling
protocol is observed. It shows that Chromia powder is not generically an
isotropic ME effective medium but provides a pathway to realize the elusive
isotropic ME response.

Color centers in diamond are one of the most promising tools for quantum
information science. Of particular interest is the use of single-crystal
diamond membranes with nanoscale-thickness as hosts for color centers. Indeed,
such structures guarantee a better integration with a variety of other quantum
materials or devices, which can aid the development of diamond-based quantum
technologies, from nanophotonics to quantum sensing. A common approach for
membrane production is what is known as "smart-cut", a process where membranes
are exfoliated from a diamond substrate after the creation of a thin
sub-surface amorphous carbon layer by He$^+$ implantation. Due to the high ion
fluence required, this process can be time-consuming. In this work, we
demonstrated the production of thin diamond membranes by neon implantation of
diamond substrates. With the target of obtaining membranes of $\sim$ 200 nm
thickness and finding the critical damage threshold, we implanted different
diamonds with 300 keV Ne$^+$ ions at different fluences. We characterized the
structural properties of the implanted diamonds and the resulting membranes
through SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. We also
found that a SRIM model based on a two-layer diamond/sp$^2$-carbon target
better describes ion implantation, allowing us to estimate the diamond critical
damage threshold for Ne$^+$ implantation. Compared to He$^+$ smart-cut, the use
of a heavier ion like Ne$^+$ results in a ten-fold decrease in the ion fluence
required to obtain diamond membranes and allows to obtain shallower smart-cuts,
i.e. thinner membranes, at the same ion energy.

The $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ has exceptional electronic properties with vast
potential in power and RF electronics. Despite the excellent demonstrations of
high-performance unipolar devices, the lack of p-type doping in
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ has hindered the development of Ga$_2$O$_3$-based bipolar
devices. The approach of p-n diodes formed by polycrystalline p-type oxides
with n-type $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can face severe challenges in further advancing
the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ bipolar devices due to their unfavorable band alignment
and the poor p-type oxide crystal quality. In this work, we applied the
semiconductor grafting approach to fabricate monocrystalline
Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diodes for the first time. With enhanced
concentration of oxygen atoms at the interface of Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$,
double side surface passivation was achieved for both Si and
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ with an interface Dit value of 1-3 x 1012 /cm2 eV. A
Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diode array with high fabrication yield was
demonstrated along with a diode rectification of 1.3 x 107 at +/- 2 V, a diode
ideality factor of 1.13 and avalanche reverse breakdown characteristics. The
diodes C-V shows frequency dispersion-free characteristics from 10 kHz to 2
MHz. Our work has set the foundation toward future development of
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based transistors.

<h3>Exploring interacting chiral spin chains in terms of black hole physics</h3>

In this paper we explore the properties of a 1-dimensional spin chain in the
presence of chiral interactions, focusing on the system's transition to
distinct chiral phases for various values of the chiral coupling. By employing
the mean field theory approximation we establish a connection between this
chiral system and a Dirac particle in the curved spacetime of a black hole.
Surprisingly, the black hole horizon coincides with the interface between
distinct chiral phases. We examine the chiral properties of the system for
homogeneous couplings and in scenarios involving position dependent couplings
that correspond to black hole geometries. To determine the significance of
interactions in the chiral chain we employ bosonization techniques and derive
the corresponding Luttinger liquid model. Furthermore, we investigate the
classical version of the model to understand the impact of the chiral operator
on the spins and gain insight into the observed chirality. Our findings shed
light on the behavior of the spin chain under the influence of the chiral
operator, elucidating the implications of chirality in various contexts,
including black hole physics.

<h3>Topologically-forced electro-modulation of friction</h3>

Controlling the friction between sliding surfaces via their electric
potential (electro-modulation) is a long-standing tribological goal.
Phospholipid assemblies, whether as continuous bilayers or as close-packed
vesicles (liposomes), form highly-lubricious surface boundary layers in aqueous
media, via the hydration lubrication mechanism at the lipid-lipid interfaces,
with friction coefficients {\mu}(= [force to slide]/load) down to 10-4, thus
offering scope for large friction changes. Here we show that the friction
between two such lipid-coated surfaces can be massively modulated through very
small potentials applied to one of them, changing reversibly by up to 200-fold
or more. Atomistic simulations indicate that this arises from (fully
reversible) electroporation of the lipid bilayers under the potential-driven
inter-surface electric fields. The porated topology of the bilayers leads to
increased dehydration-induced attraction between the headgroups of opposing
bilayers; at the same time, the porated bilayer structures may bridge the gap
between the sliding surfaces. These effects act in parallel to modulate the
friction by topologically-forcing the slip plane to pass through the
intra-bilayer acyl tail interface, for which {\mu}{\approx}0.1. This enables
facile, fully-reversible electro-modulation of the friction, with a dynamic
range up to some 2 orders of magnitude larger than achieved to date.

<h3>Long-lived Higgs modes in strongly correlated condensates</h3>

We investigate order parameter fluctuations in the Hubbard model within a
time-dependent Gutzwiller approach. While in the weak coupling limit we find
that the amplitude fluctuations are short-lived due to a degeneracy with the
energy of the edge of the quasiparticle continua (and in agreement with
Hartree-Fock + RPA theory), these are shifted below the edge upon increasing
the interaction. Our calculations therefore predict undamped amplitude (Higgs)
oscillations of the order parameter in strongly coupled superconductors, cold
atomic fermion condensates and in strongly interacting charge- and spin-density
wave systems. We propose an experimental realization for the detection of the
spin-type Higgs mode in undoped cuprates and related materials where, due to
the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, it can couple to an out-of plane
ferromagnetic excitation which is visible via the Faraday effect.

<h3>Classification of Classical Spin Liquids: Detailed Formalism and Suite  of Examples</h3>

The hallmark of highly frustrated systems is the presence of many states
close in energy to the ground state. Fluctuations between these states can
preclude the emergence of any form of order and lead to the appearance of spin
liquids. Even on the classical level, spin liquids are not all alike: they may
have algebraic or exponential correlation decay, and various forms of long
wavelength description, including vector or tensor gauge theories. Here, we
introduce a classification scheme, allowing us to fit the diversity of
classical spin liquids (CSLs) into a general framework as well as predict and
construct new kinds. CSLs with either algebraic or exponential
correlation-decay can be classified via the properties of the bottom flat
band(s) in their soft-spin Hamiltonians. The classification of the former is
based on the algebraic structures of gapless points in the spectra, which
relate directly to the emergent generalized Gauss's laws that control the low
temperature physics. The second category of CSLs, meanwhile, are classified by
the fragile topology of the gapped bottom band(s). Utilizing the classification
scheme we construct new models realizing exotic CSLs, including one with
anisotropic generalized Gauss's laws and charges with subdimensional mobility,
one with a network of pinch-line singularities in its correlation functions,
and a series of fragile topological CSLs connected by zero-temperature
transitions.

Despite significant advances in the last decade regarding the room
temperature stabilization of skyrmions or their current induced dynamics, the
impact of local material inhomogeneities still remains an important issue that
impedes to reach the regime of steady state motion of these spin textures.
Here, we study the spin-torque driven motion of skyrmions in synthetic
ferrimagnetic multilayers with the aim of achieving high mobility and reduced
skyrmion Hall effect. We consider Pt|Co|Tb multilayers of various thicknesses
with antiferromagnetic coupling between the Co and Tb magnetization. The
increase of Tb thickness in the multilayers allows to reduce the total magnetic
moment and increases the spin-orbit torques allowing to reach velocities up to
400 m.s-1 for skyrmions with diameters of about 160 nm. We demonstrate that due
to reduced skyrmion Hall effect, combined with the edge repulsion of the
magnetic track making the skyrmions moving along the track without any
transverse deflection. Further, by comparing the field-induced domain wall
motion and current-induced skyrmion motion, we demonstrate that the skyrmions
at the largest current densities present all the characteristics of a dynamical
flow regime.

We have found the first instance of a third-order topological Anderson
insulator (TOTAI). This disorder-induced topological phase is gapped and
characterized by a quantized octupole moment and topologically protected corner
states, as revealed by a detailed numerically exact analysis. We also find that
the disorder-induced transition into the TOTAI phase can be analytically
captured with remarkable accuracy using the self-consistent Born approximation.
For a larger disorder strength, the TOTAI undergoes a transition to a trivial
diffusive metal, that in turn becomes an Anderson insulator at even larger
disorder. Our findings show that disorder can induce third-order topological
phases in 3D, therefore extending the class of known higher-order topological
Anderson insulators.

<br>
The present study demonstrates a large enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient
and ultralow thermal conductivity (TE) in Sb$_2$Te$_3$-AgSbTe$_2$ nanocomposite
thin film. The addition of Ag leads to the in-situ formation of AgSbTe$_2$
secondary phase nanoaggregates in the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ matrix during the growth
resulting in a large Seebeck coefficient and reduction of the thermal
conductivity. A series of samples with different amounts of minor AgSbTe$_2$
phases are prepared to optimize the TE performance of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ thin films.
Based on the experimental and theoretical evidence, it is concluded that a
small concentration of Ag promotes the band flattening and induces a sharp
resonate-like state deep inside the valence band of Sb$_2$Te$_3$, concurrently
modifying the density of states (DOS) of the composite sample. In addition, the
electrical potential barrier introduced by the band offset between the host TE
matrix and the secondary phases promotes strong energy-dependent carrier
scattering in the composite sample, which is also responsible for enhanced TE
performance. A contemporary approach based on scanning thermal microscopy is
performed to experimentally obtain thermal conductivity values of both the
in-plane and cross-plane directions, showing a reduced in-plane thermal
conductivity value by ~ 58% upon incorporating the AgSbTe$_2$ phase in the
Sb$_2$Te$_3$ matrix. Benefitting from the synergistic manipulation of
electrical and thermal transport, a large ZT value of 2.2 is achieved at 375 K.
The present study indicates the importance of a combined effect of band
structure modification and energy-dependent charge carrier scattering along
with reduced thermal conductivity for enhancing TE properties.

<br>
The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is a method for the one-band
Hubbard model that can be both numerically efficient and reliable. However,
TPSC fails to yield physical results deep in the renormalized classical regime
of the bidimensional Hubbard model where the spin correlation length becomes
exponentially large. We address the limitations of TPSC with improved
approaches that we call TPSC+ and TPSC+SFM. In this work, we show that these
improved methods satisfy the Mermin-Wagner theorem and the Pauli principle. We
also show that they are valid in the renormalized classical regime of the 2D
Hubbard model, where they recover a generalized Stoner criterion at zero
temperature in the antiferromagnetic phase. We discuss some limitations of the
TPSC+ approach with regards to the violation of the f-sum rule and conservation
laws, which are solved within the TPSC+SFM framework. Finally, we benchmark the
TPSC+ and TPSC+SFM approaches for the one-band Hubbard model in two dimensions
and show how they have an overall better agreement with available diagrammatic
Monte Carlo results than the original TPSC approach.

We propose an analytical formulation for the Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM)
response to local tips with arbitrary strength in two dimensional
nanostructures.
The real space resolved conductance is expressed in terms of the unperturbed
quantities underlying the scattering problem.
Providing a non-dynamical approach for obtaining the SGM maps, the proposed
expression enables for a significant reduction in the computational cost of SGM
response calculations. This feature is particularly advantageous for deep
learning-based approaches which have been recently proposed for accessing local
properties and disorder landscapes from conductance measurements. This opens up
new possibilities for the SGM technique and holds exciting prospects for
quantum transport.
Further, the formula's versatility extends beyond this specific application,
offering a straightforward and computationally efficient method for obtaining
the SGM response in a more general context.

<br>

In this paper, we have examined the interplay between the lobby size $q$ in
the $q$-neighbor Ising model of opinion formation [Phys. Rev. E 92, 052105] and
the level of overlap $v$ of two fully connected graphs. Results suggest that
for each lobby size $q \ge 3$ there exists a specific level of overlap $v^*$
which destroys initially polarized clusters of opinions. By performing
Monte-Carlo simulations, backed by an analytical approach we show that the
dependence of the $v^*$ on the lobby size $q$ is far from trivial in the
absence of temperature $T \rightarrow 0$, showing a clear maximum that
additionally depends on the parity of $q$. On the other hand, the temperature
is a destructive factor, its increase leads to the earlier collapse of
polarized clusters but additionally brings a substantial decrease in the level
of polarization.

High upper-critical field superconducting alloys are required for
superconducting device applications. In this study, we extensively
characterized the structure and superconducting properties of alloys Ta$_{x}$
Hf$_{1-x}$ (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8). The substitution of Hf (T$_{C}$ =

shows an anomalous enhancement of T$_{C}$ with variation of composition.
Interestingly, all compositions exhibited strongly coupled bulk type-II
superconductivity with a high upper critical field. In particular, for
compositions x = 0.2, and 0.4, the upper critical field (H$_{C2}$) approached
the Pauli limiting field.
