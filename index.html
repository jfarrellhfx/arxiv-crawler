<h3>Ergodicity breaking from Rydberg clusters in a driven-dissipative  many-body system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07032" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07032</a>
<br>

<br>
It is challenging to probe ergodicity breaking trends of a quantum many-body
system when dissipation inevitably damages quantum coherence originated from
coherent coupling and dispersive two-body interactions. Rydberg atoms provide a
test bed to detect emergent exotic many-body phases and non-ergodic dynamics
where the strong Rydberg atom interaction competes with and overtakes
dissipative effects even at room temperature. Here we report experimental
evidence of a transition from ergodic towards ergodic breaking dynamics in
driven-dissipative Rydberg atomic gases. The broken ergodicity is featured by
the long-time phase oscillation, which is attributed from the formation of
Rydberg excitation clusters in limit cycle phases. The broken symmetry in the
limit cycle is a direct manifestation of many-body interactions, which is
verified by tuning atomic densities in our experiment. The reported result
reveals that Rydberg many-body systems are a promising candidate to probe
ergodicity breaking dynamics, such as limit cycles, and enable the benchmark of
non-equilibrium phase transition.

<h3>Quantum Oscillations in an Impurity-Band Anderson Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07047" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07047</a>
<br>
<i>N. R. Cooper, Jack Kelsall</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that for a system of localized electrons in an impurity band, which
form an Anderson insulating state at zero temperature, there can appear quantum
oscillations of the magnetization, i.e. the Anderson insulator can exhibit the
de Haas-van Alphen effect. This is possible when the electronic band from which
the localized states are formed has an extremum that traces out a nonzero area
in reciprocal space. Our work extends existing theories for clean band
insulators of this form to the situation where they host an impurity band. We
show that the energies of these impurity levels oscillate with magnetic field,
and compute the conditions under which these oscillations can dominate the de
Haas-van Alphen effect. We discuss our results in connection with experimental
measurements of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulators, and propose other
experimental systems where the impurity band contribution can be dominant.

<h3>Nodal semimetals in $d\geq3$ to sharp pseudo-Landau levels by  dimensional reduction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07051</a>

Non-uniform strain applied to graphene's honeycomb lattice can induce
pseudo-Landau levels in the single-particle spectrum. Various generalizations
have been put forward, including a particular family of hopping models in $d$
space dimensions. Here we show that the key ingredient for sharp pseudo-Landau
levels in higher dimensions is dimensional reduction. We consider particles
moving on a $d$-dimensional hyper-diamond lattice which displays a semimetallic
bandstructure, with a $(d-2)$-dimensional nodal manifold. By applying a
suitable strain pattern, the single-particle spectrum evolves into a sequence
of relativistic Landau levels. We develop and solve the corresponding field
theory: Each nodal point effectively generates a Landau-level problem which is
strictly two-dimensional to leading order in the applied strain. While the
effective pseudo-vector potential varies across the nodal manifold, the
Landau-level spacing does not. Our theory paves the way to strain engineering
of single-particle states via dimensional reduction and beyond global minimal
coupling.

<h3>Gaining insights on anyon condensation and 1-form symmetry breaking  across a topological phase transition in a deformed toric code model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07063" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07063</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We examine the condensation and confinement mechanisms exhibited by a
deformed toric code model proposed in [Castelnovo and Chamon, Phys. Rev. B,
2008]. The model describes both sides of a phase transition from a topological
phase to a trivial phase. Our findings reveal an unconventional confinement
mechanism that governs the behavior of the toric code excitations within the
trivial phase. Specifically, the confined magnetic charge can still be
displaced without any energy cost, albeit only via the application of
non-unitary operators that reduce the norm of the state. This peculiar
phenomenon can be attributed to a previously known feature of the model: it
maintains the non-trivial ground state degeneracy of the toric code throughout
the transition. We describe how this degeneracy arises in both phases in terms
of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a generalized (1-form) symmetry and explain
why such symmetry breaking is compatible with the trivial phase. The present
study implies the existence of subtle considerations that must be addressed in
the context of recently posited connections between topological phases and
broken higher-form symmetries.

<h3>Pattern formation under mechanical stress in active biological networks  confined inside evaporating droplets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07099</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Active networks made of biopolymers and motor proteins are valuable
bioinspired systems that have been used in the last decades to study the
cytoskeleton and its self-organization under mechanical stimulation. Different
techniques are available to apply external mechanical cues to such structures.
However, they often require setups that hardly mimic the biological
environment. In our study we use an evaporating sessile multi-component droplet
to confine and mechanically stimulate our active network made of microtubules
and kinesin motor proteins. Due to the well-characterized flow field inside an
evaporating droplet, we can fathom the coupling of the intrinsic activity of
the biological material with the shear stress generated by the flow inside the
droplet. We observe the emergence of a dynamic pattern due to this combination
of forces that vary during the evaporation period. We delineate the role that
the composition of the aqueous environment and the nature of the substrate play
in pattern formation. We demonstrate that evaporating droplets may serve as
bioreactors that supports cellular processes and allows investigation on the
dynamics of membraneless compartments. Such a setup is an original tool for
biological structures to understand the mechanisms underlying the activity of
the cytoskeleton under stress and, on the other hand, to investigate the
potential of such adaptive materials compared to conventional materials.

<h3>Detecting Fractionalization in Critical Spin Liquids using Color Centers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07112</a>
<br>
<i>So Takei, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are highly entangled ground states of insulating
spin systems, in which magnetic ordering is prevented down to the lowest
temperatures due to quantum fluctuations. One of the most extraordinary
characteristics of QSL phases is their ability to support fractionalized,
low-energy quasiparticles known as spinons, which carry spin-1/2 but bear no
charge. Relaxometry based on color centers in crystalline materials -- of which
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a well-explored example --
provides an exciting new platform to probe the spin spectral functions of
magnetic materials with both energy and momentum resolution and to search for
signatures of these elusive, fractionalized excitations. In this work, we
theoretically investigate the color-center relaxometry of two archetypal QSLs:
the two-dimensional U(1) QSL with a spinon Fermi surface and the spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic spin chain. The former is characterized by a metallic,
spin-split ground state of mobile, interacting spinons, which closely resembles
a spin-polarized Fermi liquid ground state but with neutral quasiparticles. We
show that the observation of the Stoner continuum and the collective spin wave
mode in the spin spectral function would provide a strong evidence for the
existence of spinons and fractionalization. In one dimension, mobile spinons
form a Luttinger liquid ground state. We show that the spin spectral function
exhibits strong features representing the collective density and spin-wave
modes, which are broadened in an algebraic fashion with an exponent
characterized by the Luttinger parameter. The possibilities of measuring these
collective modes and detecting the power-law decay of the spectral weight using
NV relaxometry are discussed. We also examine how the transition rates are
modified by marginally irrelevant operators in the Heisenberg limit.

<h3>Kwinking as the plastic forming mechanism of B19$^\prime$ NiTi  martensite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07125" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07125</a>
<br>
<i>Hanuš Seiner, Petr Sedlák, Miroslav Frost, Petr Šittner</i>
<br>
<br>
Irreversible plastic forming of B19$^\prime$ martensite of the NiTi shape
memory alloy is discussed within the framework of continuum mechanics. It is
suggested that the main mechanism arises from coupling between martensite
reorientation via twinning and a coordinated dislocation slip. A heuristic
model is proposed, showing that the ${(20\bar{1})_{\rm M}}$ deformation-twin
bands, commonly observed in experiments, can be interpreted as a combination of
dislocation-mediated kink bands, appearing due to strong plastic anisotropy,
and reversible twinning of martensite. For this combination of twinning and
plastic kinking in the B19$^\prime$ lattice, we introduce a term 'kwinking'.
The model is subsequently formulated using the tools of nonlinear elasticity
theory of martensite and crystal plasticity, and it is shown that the
${(20\bar{1})_{\rm M}}$ kwink bands may be understood as results of energy
minimization, and that their nucleation and growth and their pairing with
$(100)_{\rm M}$ twins into specific patterns enables low-energy plastic forming
of NiTi martensite.

<h3>Quantum phases of $sp^2$-orbital bosonic gases in a hexagonal lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07162</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Orbital degree of freedom plays an important role for understanding quantum
many-body phenomena. In this work, we study an experimentally related setup
with ultracold bosons loaded into hybridized bands of two-dimensional hexagonal
optical lattices. We find that the system supports various quantum many-body
phases at zero temperature, including chiral superfluid and chiral Mott
insulator by breaking time-reversal symmetry, and time-reversal-even insulating
phase, based on dynamical mean-field theory. To explain the time-reversal-even
phase, a fourth-order orbital-exchange model is derived to explain the
underlying mechanics. To relate to experimental situations, we make
band-structure calculations to obtain the Hubbard parameters, and show that
these orbital ordering phases persist also in the presence of
next-nearest-neighbor hopping.

<h3>Chess-board Acoustic Crystals with Momentum-space Nonsymmorphic  Symmetries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07174" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07174</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Spatial symmetries appearing in both real and momentum space are of
fundamental significance to crystals. However, in the conventional framework,
every space group in real space, either symmorphic or nonsymmorphic,
corresponds to a symmorphic dual in momentum space. Our experiment breaks the
framework by showing that in a 2D acoustic crystal with chess-board pattern of
$\pi$ and 0 fluxes, mirror reflections are manifested nonsymmorphically as
glide reflections in momentum space. These momentum-space nonsymmorphic
symmetries stem from projective, rather than ordinary, representations of the
real-space symmetries due to the peculiar flux pattern. Moreover, our
experiment demonstrates that the glide reflection can reduce the topological
type of the Brillouin zone from the torus to the Klein bottle, resulting in
novel topological phases with new topological invariants. Since crystalline
topologies are based on momentum-space symmetries, our work paves the way for
utilizing engineerable gauge fluxes over artificial crystals to extend the
current topological classifications into the broader regime of momentum-space
nonsymmorphic symmetries.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic structure of alkali metal superoxide CsO$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07189" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07189</a>
<br>
<i>Takehito Nakano, Shun Kontani, Masatoshi Hiraishi, Kaito Mita, Mizuki Miyajima, Takashi Kambe</i>
<br>
<br>
We have performed a powder neutron diffraction study on CsO$_2$, where the
unpaired electron with $s=1/2$ in the $\pi^*$ orbital of the O$_2^-$ ion is
responsible for the magnetism. The magnetic reflections 0 $\frac{1}{2}$ 0 and 0
$\frac{1}{2}$ 1 were observed below the N\'{e}el temperature of about 10 K. An
antiferromagnetic structure with a propagation vector of (0 ,$\frac{1}{2}$, 0)
and magnetic moments parallel to the $a$-axis is the most plausible. The
magnitude of the ordered moment is about 0.2 $\mu_B$, which is considered to be
strongly suppressed due to the one-dimensionality of the system. We propose a
possible $\pi^*$ orbital order that can explain the obtained magnetic
structure, and discuss its relation to the one-dimensionality.

<h3>Observation of 1D Fermi arc states in Weyl semimetal TaAs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07191" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07191</a>

<br>
<br>
Fermi arcs on Weyl semimetals exhibit many exotic quantum phenomena. Usually
considered on atomically-flat surfaces with approximate translation symmetry,
Fermi arcs are rooted in peculiar topology of bulk Bloch bands of
three-dimensional (3D) crystals. The fundamental question of whether a 1D Fermi
arc can be probed remains unanswered. Such answer could significantly broaden
potential applications of Weyl semimetals. Here, we report a direct observation
of robust edge states on atomic-scale ledges in TaAs using low-temperature
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. Spectroscopic signatures and
theoretical calculations reveal that the 1D Fermi arcs arise from the chiral
Weyl points of bulk crystal. The crossover from 2D Fermi arcs to eventual
complete localization on 1D edges was arrested experimentally on a sequence of
surfaces. Our results demonstrate extreme robustness of the bulk-boundary
correspondence, which offers topological protection for Fermi arcs, even in
cases in which the boundaries are down to atomic-scale. The persistent 1D Fermi
arcs can be profitably exploited in miniaturized quantum devices.

<h3>The dressed molecules theory for the quasi-two-dimensional quantum  anomaly</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07210" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07210</a>
<br>
<i>Fan Wu, Jian-shen Hu, Lianyi He</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, the dressed molecules theory is used to describe the
two-dimensional quantum anomaly of breathing mode in the recent experimental
system\cite{Holten2018,Peppler2018}. With the aid of a beyond mean-field,
Gaussian pair fluctuation theory, we employ the dressed molecules states to
characterize the axial excited states and the Feshbach molecular states, and
propose a complete low energy effective theory. We show that, in the whole
crossover from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC), our theory can describe the two-dimensional experimental
systems precisely in low energe region. We explain the the puzzling
experimental observations of the smaller than expected breathing mode frequency
perfectly. Our establishment of the dressed molecules theory for 2D fermions is
crucial to understand the conformal anomaly in the quasi low-dimensional
quantum systems.

<h3>Disconnection Flow-Mediated Grain Rotation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07211</a>
<br>
<i>Caihao Qiu, Marco Salvalaglio, David J. Srolovitz, Jian Han</i>
<br>
<br>
Interface migration in microstructures is mediated by the motion of line
defects with step and dislocation character, i.e., disconnections. We propose a
continuum model for arbitrarily-curved grain boundaries or heterophase
interfaces accounting for disconnections' role in grain rotation. Numerical
simulations show that their densities evolve as grain size and shape change,
generating stresses and increasing or decreasing misorientation; the
predictions agree with molecular dynamics simulations for pure
capillarity-driven evolution, and are interpreted through an extended
Cahn-Taylor model.

<h3>Spin-resolved electronic structure of ferromagnetic triple-layered  ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07222" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07222</a>
<br>
<i>Prosper Ngabonziza, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Alexei V. Fedorov, Gang Cao, J. W. Allen, G. Gebreyesus, Richard M. Martin</i>
<br>
<br>
High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals
new features of the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic triple-layered
ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. There are narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV
below the Fermi-level in two regions of the Brillouin zone: a hole-like band at
the zone-center and a saddle-point van Hove singularity at the zone edge. Below
T$_c$ each feature is almost completely spin-polarized, with opposite sign
polarization and with strong Kondo-coherence-like temperature-dependent
spectral weight variation suggestive of strong Hund's metal correlations. In
addition, there are distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority
spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi
surface contours around the zone corners. The origin of these features is in
general agreement with density functional calculations, if they are shifted to
reduce the exchange splitting, and scaled to take into account effects of
correlation. Furthermore, the deduced narrow band origins from the tri-layer
splitting of $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals implies a layer-specific spin-polarization
contribution from the narrow bands. Over a larger energy range, net
spin-majority polarization of incoherent Ru $d$-bands is observed to extend
down to the top of the oxygen bands, where additional narrow oxygen bands
contribute to the magnetism with spin-minority polarization.

<h3>Triangular vortex-lattices and giant vortices in rotating bubble  Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07237" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07237</a>
<br>
<i>Angela C White</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that three-dimensional spherical-shell condensates respond to
rotation by forming two aligned triangular Abrikosov-like vortex lattices on
each hemispherical surface. The centrifugal force due to rotation causes an
elliptical deformation of the spherical shell condensate shape and for faster
rotation rates, drives the formation of a central multi-charged
vortex-antivortex pair at the poles surrounded by a ring of singly charged
vortices in the bulk density. The vortex distributions observed in each
hemisphere take a similar form to those found in rotating harmonic plus quartic
traps.

<h3>Quantum coherent control of linear and nonlinear thermoelectricity on  graphene nanostructure heat engines</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07242</a>
<br>
<i>Yuga Kodama, Nobuhiko Taniguchi</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically show how structural modifications and controlling quantum
coherency can enhance linear and nonlinear thermoelectric performance in
graphene nanostructure heat engines. Although graphene has emerged as a
promising material for a nanoscale heat engine due to its high coherency and
tunable electronic properties, its large lattice thermal transport often limits
its thermal efficiency. Using the density-functional tight-binding method, we
demonstrate that one can suppress lattice thermal transport degrading the
thermal efficiency by deliberately manipulating the junction's bending angle at
low temperatures. We further argue that applying an optimal local gate voltage
unleashes its great potential in achieving excellent efficiency and reasonably
high output power that persist in the fully nonlinear regime.

Understanding material surfaces and interfaces is vital in applications like
catalysis or electronics. Ab initio simulations, combining energies from
electronic structure with statistical mechanics, can, in principle, predict the
structure of material surfaces as a function of thermodynamic variables.
However, accurate energy simulations are prohibitive when coupled to the vast
phase space that must be statistically sampled. Here, we present a bi-faceted
computational loop to predict surface phase diagrams of multi-component
materials that accelerates both the energy scoring and statistical sampling
methods. Fast, scalable, and data-efficient machine learning interatomic
potentials are trained on high-throughput density-functional theory
calculations through closed-loop active learning. Markov-chain Monte Carlo
sampling in the semi-grand canonical ensemble is enabled by using virtual
surface sites. The predicted surfaces for GaN(0001) and SrTiO3(001) are in
agreement with past work and suggest that the proposed strategy can model
complex material surfaces and discover previously unreported surface
terminations.

<h3>Strong-coupling Behaviour of Critical Temperature of Pb/Ag, Pb/Cu and  Pb/Al Nanocomposites Explained by Proximity Eliashberg Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07263" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07263</a>

<br>
<br>
The experimental critical temperature of systems of nanoparticles
superconducting (Pb) and normal (Ag, Cu and Al) with a random distribution and
sizes less than their respective coherence lengths, is governed by proximity
effect as the experimental data shown. At first glance the behaviour of the
variation of the critical temperature in function of the ratio of the volume
fractions of the superconducting and the normal metal components seems to
suggest a weak coupling behaviour for the superconductor. In reality, upon a
more careful analysis using Eliashberg's theory for the proximity effect, the
system instead shows a strong coupling nature. The most interesting thing is
that the theory has no free parameters and perfectly explains the behavior of
the experimental data just with the assumption, in the cases of nanoparticles
of $Ag$ and $Cu$, that the value of the density of states at the Fermi level of
silver and copper is equal to value of lead.

<h3>On automatic determination of quasicrystal orientations by indexing of  detected reflections</h3>

Automatic crystal orientation determination and orientation mapping are
important tools for research on polycrystalline materials. The most common
methods of automatic orientation determination rely on detecting and indexing
individual diffraction reflections. These methods, however, have not been used
for orientation mapping of quasicrystalline materials. The paper describes
necessary changes to existing software designed for orientation determination
of periodic crystals so that it can be applied to quasicrystals. The changes
are implemented in one of such programs. The functioning of the modified
program is illustrated by an example orientation map of an icosahedral
polycrystal.

<h3>Atypical sliding and Moire ferroelectricity in pure multilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07286" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07286</a>

<br>
<br>
Most non-ferroelectric two-dimensional materials can be endowed with
so-called sliding ferroelectricity via non-equivalent homo-bilayer stacking,
which is not applicable to mono-element systems like pure graphene bilayer with
inversion symmetry at any sliding vector. Herein we show first-principles
evidence that multilayer graphene with N>3 can all be ferroelectric, where the
polarizations of polar states stem from the symmetry breaking in stacking
configurations of across-layer instead of adjacent-layer, which are
electrically switchable via interlayer sliding. The non-polar states can also
be electrically driven to polar states via sliding, all nearly degenerate in
energy, and more diverse states with distinct polarizations will emerge in more
layers. In contrast to the ferroelectric Moire domains with opposite
polarization directions in twisted bilayers reported previously, the Moire
pattern in some multilayer graphene systems (e.g., twisted monolayer-trilayer
graphene) possess nonzero net polarizations with domains of the same direction
separated by non-polar regions, which can be electrically reversed upon
interlayer sliding. The distinct Moire bands of two polar states should
facilitate electrical detection of such sliding Moire ferroelectricity during
switching.

We show in detail how three one-body fluctuation profiles, namely the local
compressibility, the local thermal susceptibility, and the reduced density, can
be obtained from a statistical mechanical many-body description of classical
particle-based systems. We present several different and equivalent routes to
the definition of each fluctuation profile, facilitating their explicit
numerical calculation in inhomogeneous equilibrium systems. This underlying
framework is used for the derivation of further properties such as hard wall
contact theorems and novel types of inhomogeneous one-body Ornstein-Zernike
equations. The practical accessibility of all three fluctuation profiles is
exemplified by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations that we present for hard
sphere, Gaussian core and Lennard-Jones fluids in confinement.

The Interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IL-DMI) chirally couples
spins in different ferromagnetic layers of multilayer heterostructures. So far,
samples with IL-DMI have been investigated utilizing magnetometry and
magnetotransport techniques, where the interaction manifests as a tunable
chiral exchange bias field. Here, we investigate the nanoscale configuration of
the magnetization vector in a synthetic anti-ferromagnet (SAF) with IL-DMI,
after applying demagnetizing field sequences. We add different global magnetic
field offsets to the demagnetizing sequence in order to investigate the states
that form when the IL-DMI exchange bias field is fully or partially
compensated. For magnetic imaging and vector reconstruction of the remanent
magnetic states we utilize X-ray magnetic circular dichroism photoemission
electron microscopy, evidencing the formation of 360$^{\circ}$ domain wall
rings of typically 0.5-3.0 $\mu m$ in diameter. These spin textures are only
observed when the exchange bias field due to the IL-DMI is not perfectly
compensated by the magnetic field offset. From a combination of micromagnetic
simulations, magnetic charge distribution and topology arguments, we conclude
that a non-zero remanent effective field with components both parallel and
perpendicular to the anisotropy axis of the SAF is necessary to observe the
rings. This work shows how the exchange bias field due to IL-DMI can lead to
complex metastable spin states during reversal, important for the development
of novel spintronic devices.

Stability of thin liquid films on a surface can be controlled using an
external stimuli, such as electric field, temperature or light by manipulating
the total excess free energy of the system. It has been previously shown that
thin lubricating films on slippery surfaces can be destabilized via spinodal
mechanism using external electric field, which return to the original stable
configuration upon switching off the electric field. However, the role of the
frequency of the applied electric field is not clear, which is the main topic
of study in this report. When an ac electric field of fixed voltage and varying
frequency is applied across thin lubricating films of slippery surfaces,
different dewetting behavior is observed. Characteristic length and time scales
of dewetting depend strongly on the frequency of the applied voltage, which is
primarily due to the change in the dielectric behavior of the lubricating
fluid. In addition, the interplay of various time scales involved in the
dewetting process also depend on the frequency.

<h3>Rederivation of Nernst's equation without any additional assumptions</h3>

It is found that without any additional assumptions, Nernst's equation can be
re-deduced from the experimental data obtained from the thermodynamic systems
at ultra-low temperatures, and consequently, the physical content included by
Nernst's equation should not be referred to as Nernst's postulate or Nernst's
theorem. It should be called the Nernst statement. This discovery will play an
important role in improving the theoretical framework of thermodynamics. It can
effectively prevent some artificial assumptions into the third law of
thermodynamics, making which be a true reflection of the objective world. It
solves the awkward problem caused by using a thermodynamic theorem as the core
contents of a thermodynamic law for over a hundred years.

We report and rationalize the observation of a crossover from the classical
Lucas-Washburn dynamics to a long-lived anomalously slow regime for capillary
rise in simple glass tubes. We propose an analytical model considering the role
of thermal motion and the nanoscale surface topography to account for the
experimental observations. The proposed model indicates that the contact line
perimeter and the surface topography dimensions determine the crossover
condition and anomalous imbibition rate. Our findings have important
implications for the scientific understanding and technical application of
capillary imbibition and suggest strategies to control the adsorption of
specific liquids in porous materials.

We study the dynamics of a classical circuit corresponding to a discrete-time
deterministic kinetically constrained East model. We show that -- despite being
deterministic -- this "Floquet-East" model displays pre-transition behaviour,
which is a dynamical equivalent of the hydrophobic effect in water. By means of
exact calculations we prove: (i) a change in scaling with size in the
probability of inactive space-time regions (akin to the "energy-entropy"
crossover of the solvation free energy in water), (ii) a first-order phase
transition in the dynamical large deviations, (iii) the existence of the
optimal geometry for local phase separation to accommodate space-time solutes,
and (iv) a dynamical analog of "hydrophobic collapse". We discuss implications
of these exact results for circuit dynamics more generally.

<br>
<br>
BaAgAs is a ternary Dirac semimetal which can be tuned across a number of
topological orders. In this study we have investigated the bulk physical
properties of BaAgAs using density functional theory based computations. Most
of the results presented in this work are novel. The optimized structural
parameters are in good agreement with previous results. The elastic constants
indicate that BaAgAs is mechanically stable and brittle in nature. The compound
is moderately hard and possesses fair degree of machinability. There is
significant mechanical/elastic anisotropy in BaAgAs. The Debye temperature of
the compound is medium and the phonon thermal conductivity and melting
temperature are moderate as well. The bonding character is mixed with notable
covalent contribution. The electronic band structure calculations reveal clear
semimetallic behavior with a Dirac node at the Fermi level. BaAgAs has a small
ellipsoidal Fermi surface centered at the G-point of the Brillouin zone. The
phonon dispersion curves show dynamical stability. There is a clear phonon band
gap between the acoustic and the optical branches. The energy dependent optical
constants conform to the band structure calculations. The compound is an
efficient absorber of the ultraviolet light and has potential to be used as an
anti-reflection coating. Optical anisotropy of BaAgAs is moderate. The computed
repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential is low indicating that the electronic
correlations in this compound are not strong.

Quantum simulations of photoexcited low-dimensional systems are pivotal for
understanding how to functionalize and integrate novel two-dimensional (2D)
materials in next-generation optoelectronic devices. First principles
predictions are extremely challenging due to the simultaneous interplay of
light-matter, electron-electron and electron-nuclear interactions. We here
present an advanced ab initio many-body method which accounts for quantum
coherence and non-Markovian effects while treating electrons and nuclei on
equal footing, thereby preserving fundamental conservation laws like the total
energy. The impact of this advancement is demonstrated through real-time
simulations of the complex multivalley dynamics in a molybdenum disulfide
(MoS$_{2}$) monolayer pumped above gap. Within a single framework we provide a
parameter-free description of the coherent-to-incoherent crossover, elucidating
the role of microscopic and collective excitations in the dephasing and
thermalization processes.

<h3>Striation lines in intermittent fatigue crack growth in an Al alloy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Fatigue failure of crystalline materials is a difficult problem in science
and engineering, and recent results have shown that fatigue crack growth can
occur in intermittent jumps which have fat-tailed distributions. As fatigue
crack propagation is known to leave markings -- called striations -- on the
fracture surface, the distances between these should also have fat-tailed
distributions, if the crack propagation is intermittent. Here, we combine
macroscale crack tip tracking in fatigue crack growth measurements of aluminum
5005 samples with \emph{post-mortem} scanning electron microscopy imaging of
the striation lines. We introduce two different methods for extracting the
striation line spacing from the images. What we find is a similar distribution
of striation spacings as jump sizes using one of our methods, but the average
striation spacing does not correlate with the crack growth rate. We conclude
that we observe avalanche-like crack propagation, reflected in both the
macroscale crack tip tracking as well as the analysis of the fracture surfaces.
Our results show that the fracture surfaces can be used to study the
intermittency of fatigue crack propagation and in development of
crack-resistant materials. The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods
introduced are discussed.

<h3>Disclosing Early Excited State Relaxation Events in Prototypical Linear  Carbon Chains</h3>

<br>

One-dimensional (1D) linear nanostructures comprising sp-hybridized carbon
atoms, as derivatives of the prototypical allotrope known as carbyne, are
predicted to possess outstanding mechanical, thermal and electronic properties.
Despite recent advances in the synthesis, their chemical and physical
properties are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the photophysics
of a prototypical polyyne (i.e., 1D chain with alternating single and triple
carbon bonds), as the simplest model of finite carbon wire and as a prototype
of sp-carbon based chains. We perform transient absorption experiments with
high temporal resolution (<30 fs) on monodispersed hydrogen-capped hexayne
H$-$(C$\equiv$C)$_6-$H synthesized by laser ablation in liquid. With the
support of detailed computational studies based on ground state density
functional theory (DFT) and excited state time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations,
we provide a comprehensive description of the excited state relaxation
processes at early times following photoexcitation. We show that the internal
conversion from a bright high-energy singlet excited state to a low-lying
singlet dark state is ultrafast and takes place with a 200-fs time constant,
followed by thermalization on the picosecond timescale. We also show that the
timescale of these processes does not depend on the end-groups capping the
sp-carbon chain. The understanding of the primary photo-induced events in
polyynes is of key importance both for fundamental knowledge and for potential
opto-electronic and light-harvesting applications of nanostructured
carbon-based materials.

<h3>Bending Stiffness Collapse, Buckling, Topological Bands of Freestanding  Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>

The freestanding twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is unstable, below a critical
twist angle {\theta}_c~3.7 degrees, against a moire (2 \times 1) buckling
distortion at T=0. Realistic simulations reveal the concurrent unexpected
collapse of the bending rigidity, an unrelated macroscopic mechanical
parameter. An analytical model connects bending and buckling anomalies at T=0,
but as temperature rises the former fades, while buckling persists further. The
(2 \times 1) electronic properties are also surprising. The magic twist angle
narrow bands, now eight in number, fail to show zone boundary splittings
despite the new periodicity. Symmetry shows how this is dictated by an
effective single valley physics. These structural, critical, and electronic
predictions promise to make the freestanding state of TBG especially
interesting.

We wish to thank Stefan Boettcher for prompting us to further check and

reasonably larger number of initial spin configurations, our results agree with
the asymptotic scaling form assumed by finite-size corrections.

<br>
The recent successes of emerging photovoltaics (PV) such as organic and
perovskite solar cells are largely driven by innovations in material science.
However, closing the gap to commercialization still requires significant
innovation to match contradicting requirements such as performance, longevity
and recyclability. The rate of innovation, as of today, is limited by a lack of
design principles linking chemical motifs to functional microscopic structures,
and by an incapacity to experimentally access microscopic structures from
investigating macroscopic device properties. In this work, we envision a layout
of a Digital Twin for PV materials aimed at removing both limitations. The
layout combines machine learning approaches, as performed in materials
acceleration platforms (MAPs), with mathematical models derived from the
underlying physics and digital twin concepts from the engineering world. This
layout will allow using high-throughput (HT) experimentation in MAPs to improve
the parametrization of quantum chemical and solid-state models. In turn, the
improved and generalized models can be used to obtain the crucial structural
parameters from HT data. HT experimentation will thus yield a detailed
understanding of generally valid structure-property relationships, enabling
inverse molecular design, that is, predicting the optimal chemical structure
and process conditions to build PV devices satisfying a multitude of
requirements at the same time. After motivating our proposed layout of the
digital twin with causal relationships in material science, we discuss the
current state of the enabling technologies, already being able to yield insight
from HT data today. We identify open challenges with respect to the multiscale
nature of PV materials and the needed volume and diversity of data, and mention
promising approaches to address these challenges.

Spatial topology endows topological solitons, such as skyrmions and hopfions,
with fascinating dynamics. However, the temporal dimension has so far provided
a passive stage on which topological solitons evolve. Here we construct
spacetime magnetic hopfions: magnetic textures in two spatial dimensions that
when excited by a time-periodic drive develop spacetime topology. We uncover
two complementary construction routes using skyrmions by braiding their center
of mass position and by controlling their internal low-energy excitations.
Spacetime magnetic hopfions can be realized in nanopatterned grids to braid
skyrmions and in frustrated magnets under an applied AC electric field. Their
topological invariant, the spacetime Hopf index, can be tuned by the applied
electric field as demonstrated by our collective coordinate modeling and
micromagnetic simulations. The principles we have introduced to actively
control spacetime topology are not limited to magnetic solitons, opening
avenues to explore spacetime topology of general order parameters and fields.

We implemented, optimized and fully tested over multiple runs a
superconducting Josephson junction fabrication process tailored for the
integrated digital circuits that are used for control and readout of
superconducting qubits operating at millikelvin temperatures. This process was
optimized for highly energy efficient single flux quantum (ERSFQ) circuits with
the critical currents reduced by factor of ~10 as compared to those operated at
4.2 K. Specifically, it implemented Josephson junctions with 10 uA unit
critical current fabricated with a 10 uA/um2 critical current density. In order
to circumvent the substantial size increase of the SFQ circuit inductors, we
employed a NbN high kinetic inductance layer (HKIL) with a 8.5 pH/sq sheet
inductance. Similarly, to maintain the small size of junction resistive shunts,
we used a non-superconducting PdAu alloy with a 4.0 ohm/sq sheet resistance.
For integration with quantum circuits in a multi-chip module, 5 and 10 um
height bump processes were also optimized. To keep the fabrication process in
check, we developed and thoroughly tested a comprehensive Process Control
Monitor chip set.

<br>
<br>
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ has attracted a lot of attention due to its structural and
electronic similarities to La$_2$CuO$_4$ which is the parent compound of
high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. It was proposed to be a strong spin-orbit
coupled J$_{eff}$ = 1/2 Mott insulator, but the Mott nature of its insulating
ground state and the origin of the gap have not been conclusively established.
Here, we use ultrafast laser pulses to realize an insulator-metal transition in
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and probe the resulting dynamics using time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a closing of the gap and the formation
of weakly-renormalized electronic bands in the gap region. Comparing these
observations to the expected temperature and doping evolution of Mott gaps and
Hubbard bands provides clear evidence that the insulating state does not
originate from Mott correlations. We instead propose a correlated band
insulator picture, where antiferromagnetic correlations play a key role in the
opening of the gap. More broadly, our results demonstrate that energy-momentum
resolved nonequilibrium dynamics can be used to clarify the nature of
equilibrium states in correlated materials.

We investigate the second spectrum of charge carrier density fluctuations in
graphene within the McWorther model, where noise is induced by electron traps
in the substrate. Within this simple picture, we obtain a closed-form
expression including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctuations. We show that
a very extended distribution of switching rates of the electron traps in the
substrate leads to a carrier density power spectrum with a non-trivial
structure on the scale of the measurement bandwidth. This explains the
appearance of a $1/f$ component in the Gaussian part of the second spectrum,
which adds up to the expected frequency-independent term. Finally, we find that
the non-Gaussian part of the second spectrum can become quantitatively relevant
by approaching extremely low temperatures.

Ion implantation has been a key technology for the controlled surface
modification of materials in microelectronics and generally, for tribology,
biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and many more. To form shallow junctions
in Ge is a challenging task. In this work the formation and accumulation of
shallow damage profiles was studied by in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE)
for the accurate tracking and evaluation of void and damage fractions in
crystalline Ge during implantation of 200-keV Sb ions with a total fluence up
to 1E16 cm-2 and an ion flux of 2.1E12 cm-2 s-1. The consecutive stages of
damage accumulation were identified using optical multi-layer models with
quantitative parameters of the thickness of modified layers as well as the
volume fractions of amorphized material and voids. The effective size of
damaged zones formed from ion tracks initiated by individual bombarding ions
can be estimated by numerical simulation compared with the dynamics of damage
profiles measured by ion beam analysis and ellipsometry. According to our
observations, the formation of initial partial disorder was followed by
complete amorphization and void formation occurring at the fluence of about
1E15 cm-2, leading to a high volume fraction of voids and a modified layer
thickness of approx. 200 nm by the end of the irradiation process. This agrees
with the results of numerical simulations and complementary scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) measurements. In addition, we found a quasi-periodic time
dependent behavior of amorphization and void formation represented by
alternating accelerations and decelerations of different reorganization
processes, respectively.

Insulators with non-trivial topology support mid-gap modes localized at the
boundaries of the sample. We consider the spinless Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (SBHZ)
model, one of the simplest models of a Chern insulator, in contact with
external reservoirs (metallic leads) at its opposite ends. We study scattering
states formed by these edge modes using the non-equilibrium Green's function
(NEGF) formalism. These special states give rise to perfect transmission from
one lead to another, leading to quantized two-terminal conductance. We look at
the charge and current density profiles, associated to these modes, in the
insulator as well as in the leads. As expected, we find that the current inside
the insulator is localized along the edges of the sample. Surprisingly, we find
that even in the leads, the current density is localized and shows an
interesting zigzag pattern. We also look at finite-size effects on the
quantized two-terminal conductance and its dependence on system-reservoir
coupling.

We report resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS) of long-range magnetic
order in EuPtSi$_{\text{3}}$, combining different scattering geometries with
full linear polarization analysis to unambiguously identify magnetic scattering
contributions. At low temperatures, EuPtSi$_{\text{3}}$ stabilizes type A
antiferromagnetism featuring various long-wavelength modulations. For magnetic
fields applied in the hard magnetic basal plane, well-defined regimes of
cycloidal, conical, and fan-like superstructures may be distinguished that
encompass a pocket of commensurate type A order without superstructure. For
magnetic field applied along the easy axis, the phase diagram comprises the
cycloidal and conical superstructures only. Highlighting the power of polarized
REXS, our results reveal a combination of magnetic phases that suggest a highly
unusual competition between antiferromagnetic exchange interactions with
Dzyaloshinsky--Moriya spin--orbit coupling of similar strength.
