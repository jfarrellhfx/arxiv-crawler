<h3>Conformal four-point correlators of the 3D Ising transition via the  quantum fuzzy sphere</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04681</a>
<br>
<i>Chao Han, Liangdong Hu, W. Zhu, Yin-Chen He</i>
<br>
<br>
In conformal field theory (CFT), the four-point correlator is a fundamental
object that encodes CFT properties, constrains CFT structures, and connects to
the gravitational scattering amplitude in holography theory. However, the
four-point correlator of CFTs in dimensions higher than 2D remains largely
unexplored due to the lack of non-perturbative tools. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for directly computing four-point correlators of 3D
CFTs. Our method employs the recently proposed fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere
regularization, and we apply it to the paradigmatic 3D Ising CFT. Specifically,
we have computed three different four-point correlators: $\langle
\sigma\sigma\sigma\sigma\rangle$, $\langle
\sigma\sigma\epsilon\epsilon\rangle$, and $\langle \sigma\sigma T_{\mu\nu}
T_{\rho\eta}\rangle$. Additionally, we verify the crossing symmetry of $\langle
\sigma\sigma\sigma\sigma\rangle$, which is a notable property arising from
conformal symmetry. Remarkably, the computed four-point correlators exhibit
continuous crossing ratios, showcasing the continuum nature of the fuzzy sphere
regularization scheme. This characteristic renders them highly suitable for
future theoretical applications, enabling further advancements and insights in
3D CFT.

<h3>Tunable superdiffusion in integrable spin chains using correlated  initial states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04682</a>

<br>
<br>
Although integrable spin chains only host ballistically propagating particles
they can still feature diffusive spin transport. This diffusive spin transport
originates from quasiparticle charge fluctuations inherited from the initial
state's magnetization Gaussian fluctuations. We show that ensembles of initial
states with quasi-long range correlations lead to superdiffusive spin transport
with a tunable dynamical exponent. We substantiate our prediction with
numerical simulations and explain how deviations arise from finite time and
finite size effects.

<h3>Anderson Critical Metal Phase in Trivial States Protected by $C_{2z}T$  Symmetry on Average</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04683</a>
<br>
<i>Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen-Yu Xiao, Raquel Queiroz, B. Andrei Bernevig, Ady Stern, Zhi-Da Song</i>
<br>
<br>
The joint symmetry $C_{2z}T$ protects obstructed atomic insulators in 2D
translational invariant magnetic materials, where electrons form molecule
orbitals with charge centers away from the positions of atoms. The transitions
from these states to atomic insulators have to go through an intermediate
metallic phase accomplished by the emergence, evolution, and annihilation of
Dirac points. We show that, under (quenched) weak chemical potential disorder
that respects the $C_{2z}T$ symmetry on average, the intermediate metallic
phase remains delocalized, where every point in a finite transition process is
a scale-invariant critical metal in the thermodynamic limit. We thus refer to
the delocalized metallic phase as a crystalline-symmetry-associated critical
metal phase. The underlying mechanism cannot be explained by conventional
localization theories, such as weak anti-localization and topological phase
transition in the ten-fold way classification. Through a quantitative mapping
between lattice models and network models, we find that the critical metal
phase is equivalent to a quantum percolation problem with random fluxes. The
criticality can hence be understood through a semi-classical percolation
theory.

The realization of topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) solitons in real
materials is a major goal towards their use in information technology. While
they bear various advantages with respect to their ferromagnetic cousins, their
observation is scarce. Utilizing first-principles simulations, here we predict
new chiral particles in the realm of AFM topological magnetism, frustrated
multimeronic spin-textures hosted by a N\'eel magnetic state, arising in single
Mn layers directly grown on Ir(111) surface or interfaced with Pd-based films.
These topological structures are intrinsic, i.e. they form in a single AFM
material, can carry distinct topological charges and can combine in various
multimeronic sequences with enhanced stability against external magnetic
fields. We envision the frustrated N\'eel AFM multimerons as exciting
highly-sought after AFM solitons having the potential to be utilized in novel
spintronic devices hinging on non-synthetic AFM quantum materials.

<h3>Effects of Pressure on the Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Bulk  NiI$_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04729" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04729</a>
<br>
<i>Jesse Kapeghian, Danila Amoroso, Connor A. Occhialini, Luiz G. P. Martins, Qian Song, Jesse S. Smith, Joshua J. Sanchez, Jing Kong, Riccardo Comin, Paolo Barone, Bertrand Dupé, Matthieu J. Verstraete, Antia S. Botana</i>
<br>
<br>
Transition metal dihalides have recently garnered interest in the context of
two-dimensional van der Waals magnets as their underlying geometrically
frustrated triangular lattice leads to interesting competing exchange
interactions. In particular, NiI$_{2}$ is a magnetic semiconductor that has
been long known for its exotic helimagnetism in the bulk. Recent experiments
have shown that the helimagnetic state survives down to the monolayer limit
with a layer-dependent magnetic transition temperature that suggests a relevant
role of the interlayer coupling. Here, we explore the effects of hydrostatic
pressure as a means to enhance this interlayer exchange and ultimately tune the
electronic and magnetic response of NiI$_{2}$. We study first the evolution of
the structural parameters as a function of external pressure using
first-principles calculations combined with x-ray diffraction measurements. We
then examine the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic exchange
interactions via first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We
find that the leading interlayer coupling is an antiferromagnetic
second-nearest neighbor interaction that increases monotonically with pressure.
The ratio between isotropic third- and first-nearest neighbor intralayer
exchanges, which controls the magnetic frustration and determines the magnetic
propagation vector $\mathbf{q}$ of the helimagnetic ground state, is also
enhanced by pressure. As a consequence, our Monte Carlo simulations show a
monotonic increase in the magnetic transition temperature, indicating that
pressure is an effective means to tune the magnetic response of NiI$_{2}$.

<h3>Automatic graph representation algorithm for heterogeneous catalysis</h3>

One of the most appealing aspects of machine learning for material design is
its high throughput exploration of chemical spaces, but to reach the ceiling of
ML-aided exploration, more than current model architectures and processing
algorithms are required. New architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have seen significant research investments recently. For heterogeneous
catalysis, defining substrate intramolecular bonds and adsorbate/substrate
intermolecular bonds is a time-consuming and challenging process. Before
applying a model, dataset pre-processing, node/bond descriptor design, and
specific model constraints have to be considered. In this work, a framework
designed to solve these issues is presented in the form of an automatic graph
representation algorithm (AGRA) tool to extract the local chemical environment
of metallic surface adsorption sites is presented. This tool is able to gather
multiple adsorption geometry datasets composed of different systems and combine
them into a single model. To show AGRA's excellent transferability and reduced
computational cost compared to other graph representation methods, it was
applied to 5 different catalytic reaction datasets and benchmarked against the
Open Catalyst Projects (OCP) graph representation method. The two ORR datasets
with O/OH adsorbates obtained 0.053 eV RMSD when combined together, whereas the
three CO2RR datasets with CHO/CO/COOH obtained an average performance of 0.088
eV RMSD. To further display the algorithm's versatility and extrapolation
ability, a model was trained on a subset combination of all 5 datasets with an
RMSD of 0.105 eV. This universal model was then used to predict a wide range of
adsorption energies and an entirely new ORR catalyst system and then verified
through Density Functional Theory calculations

<h3>Entanglement Growth and Minimal Membranes in $(d+1)$ Random Unitary  Circuits</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Understanding the nature of entanglement growth in many-body systems is one
of the fundamental questions in quantum physics. Here, we study this problem by
characterizing the entanglement fluctuations and distribution of $(d+1)$ qubit
lattice evolved under a random unitary circuit. Focusing on Clifford gates, we
perform extensive numerical simulations of random circuits in $1\le d\le 4$
dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that properties of growth of bipartite
entanglement entropy are characterized by the roughening exponents of a
$d$-dimensional membrane in a $(d+1)$ elastic medium.

<h3>A nonequilibrium system on a restricted scale-free network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04780" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04780</a>
<br>
<i>R. A. Dumer, M. Godoy</i>
<br>
<br>
The nonequilibrium Ising model on a restricted scale-free network has been
studied with one- and two-spin flip competing dynamics employing Monte Carlo
simulations. The dynamics present in the system can be defined by the
probability $q$ in which the one-spin flip process simulate the contact with a
heat bath at a given temperature $T$, and with a probability ($1-q$) the
two-spin flip process mimics the system subjected to an external flux of energy
into it. The system network is described by a power-law degree distribution in
the form $P(k)\sim k^{-\alpha}$, and the restriction is made by fixing the
maximum, $k_{m}$, and minimum, $k_{0}$, degree on distribution for the whole
network size. This restriction keeps finite the second and fourth moment of
degree distribution, allowing us to obtain a finite critical point for any
value of $\alpha$. For these critical points, we have calculated the
thermodynamic quantities of the system, such as, the total ${m}_{N}^{F}$ and
staggered ${m}_{N}^{AF}$ magnetizations per spin, susceptibility $\chi_{N}$,
and reduced fourth-order Binder cumulant ${U}_{N}$, for several values of
lattice size $N$ and exponent $1\le\alpha\le5$. Therefore, the phase diagram
was built and a self-organization phenomena is observed from the transitions
between antiferromagnetic AF to paramagnetic P, and P to ferromagnetic F
phases. Using the finite-size scaling theory, we also obtained the critical
exponents for the system, and a mean-field critical behavior is observed,
exhibiting the same universality class of the system on the equilibrium and out
of it.

<h3>Compressibility and speeds of sound across the superfluid to supersolid  phase transition of an elongated dipolar gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04794" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04794</a>
<br>
<i>P. B. Blakie, L. Chomaz, D. Baillie, F. Ferlaino</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the excitation spectrum and compressibility of a dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensate in an infinite tube potential in the parameter regime
where the transition between superfluid and supersolid phases occurs. Our study
focuses on the density range in which crystalline order develops continuously
across the transition. Above the transition the superfluid shows a single
gapless excitation band, phononic at small momenta and with a roton at a finite
momentum. Below the transition, two gapless excitations branches (three at the
transition point) emerge in the supersolid. We examine the two gapless
excitation bands and their associated speeds of sound in the supersolid phase.
Our results show that the speeds of sound and the compressibility are
discontinuous at the transition, indicating a second-order phase transition.
These results provide valuable insights into the identification of supersolid
phenomena in dipolar quantum gases and the relationship to supersolidity in
spin-orbit coupled gases.

<h3>Emergent Magnetic Phases and Piezomagnetic Effects in  Mn$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$F$_2$ Thin Film Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04809" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04809</a>
<br>
<i>Ryan Van Haren, Nessa Hald, David Lederman</i>
<br>
<br>
The effect of random competing single-ion anisotropies in antiferromagnets
was studied using epitaxial Mn$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$F$_2$ antiferromagnetic thin film
alloys grown via molecular beam epitaxy. The crystal structure of this material
is tetragonal for all values of $x$, and the Mn sites have a magnetic easy axis
single-ion anisotropy while the Ni sites have an easy plane anisotropy
perpendicular to the Mn easy axis. Crystallographic and magnetization
measurements demonstrated that the thin film alloys were homogeneously mixed
and did not phase-separate into their constituent parts. Pure MnF$_2$ thin
films epitaxially grown on MgF$_2$ exhibited compressive strain along all three
crystallographic axes which resulted in piezomagnetic effects. The
piezomagnetism disappeared if the film was grown on a (MnNi)F$_2$ graded buffer
layer. A mean-field theory fit to the transition temperature as a function of
the Mn concentration $x$, which takes into account piezomagnetic effects, gave
a magnetic exchange constant between Mn and Ni ions of $J_{\text{MnNi}} = 0.305
\pm 0.003$~meV. Mean-field theory calculations also predicted the existence of
an oblique antiferromagnetic phase in the Mn$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$F$_2$ alloy which
agreed with the experimental data. A magnetic phase diagram for
Mn$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$F$_2$ thin film alloys was constructed and showed evidence for
the existence of two unique magnetic phases, in addition to the ordinary
antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases: an oblique antiferromagnetic phase,
and an emergent magnetic phase proposed to be either a magnetic glassy phase or
a helical phase. The phase diagram is quantitatively different from that of
Fe$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$F$_2$ because of the much larger single-ion anisotropy of
Fe$^{2+}$ compared to Mn$^{2+}$.

<h3>The Performance of VQE across a phase transition point in the  $J_1$-$J_2$ model on kagome lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04851</a>

<br>
<br>
Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an efficient classical-quantum
hybrid method to take advantage of quantum computers in the Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work we test the performance of
VQE by studying the $J_1$-$J_2$ anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the
kagome lattice, which is found to display a first order phase transition at
$J_2 / J_1 \approx 0.01$. By comparing the VQE states with the exact
diagonalization results, we find VQE energies agree well with the exact values
in most region of parameters for the 18-site system we studied. However, near
the phase transition point, VQE tends to converge to the excited states when
the number of variational parameters is not large enough. For the system
studied in this work, this issue can be solved by either increasing the number
of parameters or by initializing the parameters with converged values for
$J_2/J_1$ away from the phase transition point. Our results provide useful
guidance for the practical application of VQE on real quantum computers to
study strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.

<h3>Charge Order Evolution of Superconducting BaNi2As2 Under High Pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
BaNi$_2$As$_2$, a non-magnetic superconductor counterpart to BaFe$_2$As$_2$,
has been shown to develop nematic order, multiple charge orders, and a dramatic
six-fold enhancement of superconductivity via isovalent chemical substitution
of Sr for Ba. Here we present high pressure single-crystal and powder x-ray
diffraction measurements of BaNi$_2$As$_2$ to study the effects of tuning
lattice density on the evolution of charge order in this system. Single-crystal
X-ray experiments track the evolution of the incommensurate (Q=0.28) and
commensurate (Q=0.33 and Q=0.5) charge orders, and the tetragonal-triclinic
distortion as a function of temperature up to pressures of 10.4 GPa, and powder
diffraction experiments at 300 K provide lattice parameters up to 17 GPa. We
find that applying pressure to BaNi$_2$As$_2$ produces a similar evolution of
structural and charge-ordered phases as found as a function of chemical
pressure in Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$As$_2$ , with coexisting commensurate
charge orders appearing on increasing pressure. These phases also exhibit a
similar abrupt cutoff at a critical pressure of (9 $\pm$ 0.5) GPa, where powder
diffraction experiments indicate a collapse of the tetragonal structure at
higher temperatures. We discuss the relationship between this collapsed
tetragonal phase and the discontinuous phase boundary observed at the optimal
substitution value for superconductivity in Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$As$_2$

<h3>Non-coplanar helimagnetism in the layered van-der-Waals metal DyTe$_3$</h3>

Magnetic materials with highly anisotropic chemical bonding can be exfoliated
to realize ultrathin sheets or interfaces with highly controllable optical or
spintronics responses, while also promising novel cross-correlation phenomena
between electric polarization and the magnetic texture. The vast majority of
these van-der-Waals magnets are collinear ferro-, ferri-, or antiferromagnets,
with a particular scarcity of lattice-incommensurate helimagnets of defined
left- or right-handed rotation sense, or helicity. Here we use polarized
neutron scattering to reveal cycloidal, or conical, magnetic structures in
DyTe$_3$, where insulating double-slabs of dysprosium square nets are separated
by highly metallic tellurium layers. We identify a hierarchy of energy scales
with -- in order of decreasing strength -- antiferromagnetic exchange
interactions, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and periodic modulations of the
exchange energy. The latter are attributed to magneto-elastic coupling to the
unconventional charge order in DyTe$_3$. This easily cleavable metallic
helimagnet also hosts a complex magnetic phase diagram indicative of competing
interactions. Our work paves the way for twistronics research, where
helimagnetic layers can be combined to form complex spin textures on-demand,
using the vast family of rare earth chalcogenides and beyond.

<h3>Low-Scaling Algorithm for the Random Phase Approximation using Tensor  Hypercontraction with k-point Sampling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04880</a>
<br>
<i>Chia-Nan Yeh, Miguel A. Morales</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a low-scaling algorithm for the random phase approximation (RPA)
with \textbf{k}-point sampling in the framework of tensor hypercontraction
(THC) for electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). The THC factorization is
obtained via a revised interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) procedure
with a momentum-dependent auxiliary basis for generic single-particle Bloch
orbitals. Our formulation does not require pre-optimized interpolating points
nor auxiliary bases, and the accuracy is systematically controlled by the
number of interpolating points. The resulting RPA algorithm scales linearly
with the number of \textbf{k}-points and cubically with the system size without
any assumption on sparsity or locality of orbitals. The errors of ERIs and RPA
energy show rapid convergence with respect to the size of the THC auxiliary
basis, suggesting a promising and robust direction to construct efficient
algorithms of higher-order many-body perturbation theories for large-scale
systems.

<h3>Three consecutive quantum anomalous Hall gaps in a metal-organic network</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, chiral edge states are present in
the absence of magnetic fields due to the intrinsic band topology. In this
work, we predict that a synthesized two-dimensional metal-organic material, a
Fe(biphenolate)$_3$ network, can be a unique QAH insulator, in which there are
three consecutive nontrivial bandgaps. Based on first-principles calculations
with effective model analysis, we reveal such nontrivial topology is from the
$3$d$_{xz}$ and $3$d$_{yz}$ orbitals of Fe atoms. Moreover, we further study
the effect of substrates, and the results shows that the metallic substrates
used in the experiments (Ag and Cu) are unfavorable for observing the QAH
effect whereas a hexagonal boron nitride substrate with a large bandgap may be
a good candidate, where the three consecutive QAH gaps appear inside the
substrate gap. The presence of three consecutive bandgaps near the Fermi level
will significantly facilitate observations of the QAH effect in experiments.

Monolayer germanium sulfide is gaining significant attention for its
exceptional anisotropic electronic conductance, notable excitonic effects, and
wide range of potential applications. In our study, we used density functional
theory, many-body perturbation theory, and non-equilibrium Green function to
investigate electronic transport properties and exciton radiative lifetime of
single-layer germanium sulfide. Our theoretical findings showed that applying
up to 8 percent compressive strain increased carrier mobility by nearly
threefold, and thus, dramatically enhance the device's current intensity.
Moreover, we observed that strain engineering allowed fine-tuning of the
electron-hole recombination time. At 6 percent tensile strain, the effective
radiative lifetime was as short as 19 picoseconds, which is 4.5 times faster
than the intrinsic state and 80 times faster than at 8 percent compressive
strain. These results highlight the potential of strain engineering to
customize the electronic and optical properties of GeS monolayer for specific
electronic, optoelectronic, and photovoltaic device requirements

<h3>Triplet State and Auger-Type Excitation Originating from Two-Electron  Tunneling in Field Emission Resonance on Ag(100)</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this study, we discovered that the energy gap above the vacuum level in
the projected bulk band structure of Ag(100) prevents electrons in the
first-order field emission resonance (FER) from inducing the surface plasmons.
This mechanism allows light emission from FER to reveal characteristics of
triplet states and Auger-type excitation resulting from two-electron tunneling
in FER. According to optical spectra, surface plasmons can be induced by
electrons in the zeroth-order FER. However, corresponding radiative decay can
also trigger Auger-type excitation, whose energy state is influenced by the
sharpness-dependent image potential acting on the scanning tunneling microscope
tip.

Amorphous solids yield upon crossing a strain threshold, after an initial
elastic response, when subjected to mechanical deformation. The yielding
process is characterized by local plastic events leading to non-affine
displacements, and their interactions. Despite the lack of long-range
structural order, these disordered materials exhibit long-range spatial
correlations in the non-affine displacement fields, which stems from the
underlying elasticity. Measuring a correlation length scale in deformed
amorphous solids, during the plastic process, is a non-trivial challenge, often
requiring an ad-hoc definition of localized regions. In this paper, we
introduce a novel computational approach called the "soft matrix" that enables
systematic analysis of mechanical response of local regions within a disordered
solid. In this method, we subject the amorphous solid to a quasistatic shear
and allow a local region of interest to relax freely while allowing for elastic
relaxation of the background. The dependence of the yield strain upon the size
of the probe region naturally reveals the existence of an intrinsic length
scale ($\zeta$) that governs the elasto-plastic properties, as observed in four
distinct model amorphous solids. This finding demonstrates the universality of
this characteristic length scale across a wide range of materials. We
investigate the dependence of this length scale on the material's preparation
history and find that $\zeta$ increases with better annealing. Furthermore, the
local mechanical properties measured within this framework provide more
accurate estimates compared to existing techniques. Our study paves the way for
a comprehensive understanding of amorphous solids and facilitates improved
characterization and design of these materials.

<h3>Correspondence between excited energy eigenstates and local minima of  energy landscape in quantum spin systems</h3>

The quantum-classical correspondence between local minima on the classical
energy landscape and excited eigenstates in the energy spectrum is studied
within the context of many-body quantum spin systems. In mean-field
approximations of a quantum problem, one usually focuses on attaining the
global minimum of the resulting energy function, while other minimum solutions
are usually ignored. For frustrated systems, a strict distinction between
global and local minimum is often not tenable since first-order type
transitions can interchange the roles played by two different minima. This begs
the question of whether there is any physical interpretation for the local
minima encountered in mean-field approximations of quantum systems. We look at
the problem from the perspective of quantum spin systems. Two models are
studied, a frustrated model with quenched disorder, and a pure system without
frustration. Accurate classical energies of the minima are compared with the
full spectrum of energy levels, allowing us to search for signs of
correspondence between them. It is found that the local minima can generally be
interpreted as excited energy eigenstates. Instances of spurious minima are
also reported.

The thermal conductivity (k) of polycrystalline silicon carbide thin films is
relevant for thermal management in emerging silicon carbide applications like
MEMS and optoelectronic devices. In such films k can be substantially reduced
by microstructure features including grain boundaries, thin film surfaces, and
porosity, while these microstructural effects can also be manipulated through
thermal annealing. Here, we investigate these effects by using microfabricated
suspended devices to measure the thermal conductivities of nine LPCVD silicon
carbide films of varying thickness (from 120 - 300 nm) and annealing conditions
(as-grown and annealed at 950 degrees Celsius and 1100 degrees Celsius for 2
hours, and in one case 17 hours). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra and density measurements are also
used to characterize the effects of the annealing on the microstructure of
selected samples. Compared to as-deposited films, annealing at 1100 degrees
Celsius typically increases the estimated grain size from 5.5 nm to 6.6 nm
while decreasing the porosity from around 6.5% to practically fully dense. This
corresponds to a 34% increase in the measured thin film thermal conductivity
near room temperature, from 5.8 W/m-K to 7.8 W/m-K. These thermal conductivity
measurements show good agreement of better than 3% with fits using a simple
theoretical model based on kinetic theory combined with a Maxwell-Garnett
porosity correction. Grain boundary scattering plays the dominant role in
reducing the thermal conductivity of these films compared to bulk
single-crystal values, while both grain size increase and porosity decrease
play important roles in the partial k recovery of the films upon annealing.
This work demonstrates the effects of modifying the microstructure and thus the
thermal conductivity of silicon carbide thin films by thermal annealing.

<h3>Identifying Subcascades From The Primary Damage State Of Collision  Cascades</h3>

The morphology of a collision cascade is an important aspect in understanding
the formation of defects and their distribution. While the number of
subcascades is an essential parameter to describe the cascade morphology, the
methods to compute this parameter are limited. We present a method to compute
the number of subcascades from the primary damage state of the collision
cascade. Existing methods analyse peak damage state or the end of ballistic
phase to compute the number of subcascades which is not always available in
collision cascade databases. We use density based clustering algorithm from
unsupervised machine learning domain to identify the subcascades from the
primary damage state. To validate the results of our method we first carry out
a parameter sensitivity study of the existing algorithms. The study shows that
the results are sensitive to input parameters and the choice of the time-frame
analyzed. On a database of 100 collision cascades in W, we show that the method
we propose, which analyzes primary damage state to predict number of
subcascades, is in good agreement with the existing method that works on the
peak state. We also show that the number of subcascades found with different
parameters can be used to classify and group together the cascades that have
similar time-evolution and fragmentation.

<h3>Temperature anomalies of oscillating diffusion in ac-driven periodic  systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
We analyse the impact of temperature on the diffusion coefficient of an
inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric periodic potential and driven
by a symmetric time-periodic force. Recent studies have revealed the low
friction regime in which the diffusion coefficient shows giant damped
quasi-periodic oscillations as a function of the amplitude of the time-periodic
force [I. G. Marchenko et al., Chaos 32, 113106 (2022)]. We find out that when
temperature grows the diffusion coefficient increases at its minima, however,
it decreases at the maxima within a finite temperature window. This curious
behavior is explained in terms of the deterministic dynamics perturbed by
thermal fluctuations and mean residence time of the particle in the locked and
running trajectories. We demonstrate that temperature dependence of the
diffusion coefficient can be accurately reconstructed from the stationary
probability to occupy the running trajectories.

<h3>Influence of native defects on magneto-optoelectronic properties of  $α$-MoO$_{3}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Semiconducting oxides possess a variety of intriguing electronic, optical,
and magnetic properties, and native defects play a crucial role in these
systems. In this study, we study the influence of native defects on these
properties of $\alpha$-MoO$_{3}$ using the first-principles density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. From the formation energy calculations, it is
concluded that Mo vacancies are difficult to form in the system, while O and
Mo-O co-vacancies are energetically quite favorable. We further find that
vacancies give rise to mid-gap states (trap states) that remarkably affect the
magneto-optoelectronic properties of the material. Our calculations indicate
that a single Mo vacancy leads to half-metallic behavior, and also induces a
large magnetic moment of 5.98 $\mu_{B}$. On the other hand, for the single O
vacancy case, the band gap disappears completely, but the system remains in a
non-magnetic state. For Mo-O co-vacancies of two types considered in this work,
a reduced band gap is found, along with an induced magnetic moment of 2.0
$\mu_{B}$. Furthermore, a few finite peaks below the main band edge are
observed in the absorption spectra of configurations with Mo and O vacancies,
while they are absent in the Mo-O co-vacancies of both types, just like in the
pristine state. From the ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, stability
and sustainability of induced magnetic moment at room temperate is verified.
Our findings will enable the development of defect strategies that maximize the
functionality of the system, and further help in designing highly efficient
magneto-optoelectronic and spintronic devices.

<h3>Ultraviolet Photodetectors based on GaN and AlGaN/AlN Nanowire  Ensembles: Effects of Planarization with Hydrogen Silsesquioxane and Nanowire  Architecture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04986</a>
<br>
<i>E. Akar, I. Dimkou, A. Ajay, Martien I. den Hertog, E. Monroy</i>
<br>
<br>
The interest in nanowire photodetectors stems from their potential to improve
the performance of a variety of devices, including solar cells, cameras,
sensors, and communication systems. Implementing devices based on nanowire
ensembles requires a planarization process which must be conceived to preserve
the advantages of the nanowire geometry. This is particularly challenging in
the ultraviolet (UV) range, where spin coating with hydrogen silsesquioxane
(HSQ) appears as an interesting approach in terms of transmittance and
refractive index. Here, we report a comprehensive study on UV photodetectors
based on GaN or AlGaN/AlN nanowire ensembles encapsulated in HSQ. We show that
this material is efficient for passivating the nanowire surface, it introduces
a compressive strain in the nanowires and preserves their radiative efficiency.
We discuss the final performance of planarized UV photodetectors based on three
kinds of nanowire ensembles: (i) non-intentionally-doped (nid) GaN nanowires,
(ii) Ge-doped GaN nanowires, and (iii) nid GaN nanowires terminated with an
AlGaN/AlN superlattice. The incorporation of the superlattice allows tuning the
spectral response with bias, which can enhance the carrier collection from the
AlGaN/AlN superlattice or from the GaN stem. In all the cases, the performance
of the planarized devices remains determined by the nanowire nature, since
their characteristics in terms of linearity and spectral selectivity are closer
to those demonstrated in single nanowires than those of planar devices. Thus,
the visible rejection is several orders of magnitude and there is no indication
of persistent photocurrent, which makes all the samples suitable for
UV-selective photodetection applications.

We study the influence of quantum fluctuations on the macroscopic quantum
tunneling and self-trapping of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate in a
double-well trap. Quantum fluctuations are described by the Lee-Huang-Yang term
in the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Employing the modified
Gross-Pitaevskii equation in scalar approximation, we derive the dimer model
using a two-mode approximation. The frequencies of Josephson oscillations and
self-trapping conditions under quantum fluctuations are found analytically and
proven by numerical simulations of the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The
tunneling and localization phenomena are investigated also for the case of the
Lee-Huang-Yang fluid loaded in the double-well potential.

<br>
<br>
The adsorption and diffusion of hydrogen atoms on Cu(001) are studied using
first-principles calculations. By taking into account the contribution of
zero-point energy (ZPE), the originally identical barriers are shown to be
different for H and D, which are respectively calculated to be ~ 158 meV and ~
139 meV in height. Using the transfer matrix method (TMM), we are able to
calculate the accurate probability of transmission across the barriers. The
crucial role of quantum tunneling is clearly demonstrated at low-temperature
region. By introducing a temperature-dependent attempting frequency prefactor,
the rate constants and diffusion coefficients are calculated. The results are
in agreement with the experimental measurements at temperatures from ~ 50 K to
80 K.

The pairing symmetry of superconducting states is a critical topic in the
realm of topological superconductivity. However, the pairing symmetry of the
$\mathrm{AV_3Sb_5}$ family, wherein $\mathrm{A=K,Rb,Cs}$, remains
indeterminate. To address this issue, we formulate an effective model on the
kagome lattice to describe topological superconducting states featuring chiral
charge density wave. Through this model, we explore the topological phase
diagrams and thermal Hall conductivity under various parameters, with and
without spin-orbit coupling. Our analysis reveals that the disparities in
thermal Hall conductivity curves between different pairing symmetries are
safeguarded by the topology resulting from the interplay of spin-orbital
coupling and superconducting states. Remarkably, this theoretical prediction
can potentially enable the differentiation of various superconducting pairing
symmetries in materials via experimental measurements of thermal Hall
conductivity curves.

<h3>Highly spin-polarized carriers and strong ferromagnetism in doped  perovskite antiferromagnetic semiconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
In semiconductor spintronics, the generation of highly spin-polarized
carriers and the efficient probe of spin order (due to strong ferromagnetism)
-- at or above room temperature -- are crucial because it allows for the design
of spin-based semiconductor devices. Usually, such goals were fulfilled in
room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors, being rare materials in nature.
While room-temperature antiferromagnetic semiconductors are plentiful, the
possibility for creating highly spin-polarized carriers and strong
ferromagnetism in these materials remain to be unraveled. Here, we explore such
a possibility by first-principles simulations, working with CaTcO$_3$ and
NaOsO$_3$ perovskites -- being room-temperature antiferromagnetic
semiconductors. We find that doping them by electrons or holes results in these
materials to be highly spin-polarized, carrying enormous ferromagnetic moments.
Doping electrons with moderate carrier density can yield strong ferromagnetism
in them, with the ferromagnetic moments being comparable to that in typical
ferromagnetic semiconductors. Our work thus indicates the merit of perovskite
antiferromagnetic semiconductors in spintronics -- for a possible replacement
of ferromagnetic semiconductors.

We consider in this work the different possible stationary flows of a one

regime where a transition from a time dependent flow to a stationary
diffractive flow occurs at a given critical velocity. We give nonperturbative
results for this critical velocity in the presence of a localised obstacle of
arbitrary size and strength. In addition, we discuss the existence of
superfluid-like solution in the supersonic regime due to resonant transport and
provide a complete map of the different regimes of stationary transport of a
quantum fluid.

The influence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on superconducting
correlations in thin-film superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) structures with
compensated interfaces is studied. A unique effect of anisotropic enhancement
of proximity-induced triplet correlations by the SOC is predicted. It manifests
itself in the anisotropy of the superconducting critical temperature Tc with
respect to orientation of the Neel vector relative to the S/AF interface, which
is opposite to the behaviour of Tc in superconductor/ferromagnet structures. We
show that the anisotropy is controlled by the chemical potential of the
superconductor and, therefore, can be adjusted in (quasi)2D structures.

Recently gained insights into equilibrium squeezing and entanglement harbored
by magnets point towards exciting opportunities for quantum science and
technology, while concrete protocols for exploiting these are needed. Here, we
theoretically demonstrate that a direct dispersive coupling between a qubit and
a noneigenmode magnon enables detecting the magnonic number states' quantum
superposition that forms the ground state of the actual eigenmode -
squeezed-magnon - via qubit excitation spectroscopy. Furthermore, this unique
coupling is found to enable control over the equilibrium magnon squeezing and a
deterministic generation of squeezed even Fock states via the qubit state and
its excitation. Our work demonstrates direct dispersive coupling to
noneigenmodes, realizable in spin systems, as a general pathway to exploiting
the equilibrium squeezing and related quantum properties thereby motivating a
search for similar realizations in other platforms.

<h3>Selenium and the role of defects for photovoltaic applications</h3>

We present first principles calculations of the electronic properties of
trigonal selenium with emphasis on photovoltaic applications. The band gap and
optical absorption spectrum of pristine selenium is calculated from many-body
perturbation theory yielding excellent agreement with experiments. We then
investigate the role of intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects and estimate the
equilibrium concentrations resulting from realistic synthesis conditions. The
intrinsic defects are dominated by vacancies, which act as acceptor levels and
implies $p$-doping in agreement with previous predictions and measurements, and
we show that these do not give rise to significant non-radiative recombination.
The charge balance remains dominated by vacancies when extrinsic defects are
included, but these may give rise to sizable non-radiative recombination rates,
which could severely limit the performance of selenium based solar cells. Our
results thus imply that the pollution by external elements is a decisive factor
for the photovoltaic efficiency, which will be of crucial importance when
considering synthesis conditions for any type of device engineering.

Two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb ferromagnets, such as monolayer

giving rise to a thermal magnon Hall effect. Here we report the behavior of the
topological magnons in monolayer CrI$_3$ under external stimuli, including
biaxial and uniaxial strain, electric gating, as well as in-plane and
out-of-plane magnetic field, revealing that one can thereby tailor the magnetic

Motivated by the report of superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at
high pressure, we examine the interacting electrons in this system.
First-principles many-body theory is utilized to study the normal-state
electronic properties. Below 100\,K, a multi-orbital non-Fermi liquid state
resulting from loss of Ni-ligand coherence within a flat-band dominated
low-energy landscape is uncovered. The incoherent low-temperature Fermi surface
displays strong mixing between Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital
character. In a model-Hamiltonian picture, spin fluctuations originating mostly
from the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital give rise to strong tendencies towards a
superconducting instability with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order parameter. The dramatic
enhancement of $T_{\rm c}$ in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is due to stronger
Ni-$d_{z^2}$ correlations compared to those in the infinite-layer nickelates.

<br>
<br>
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional
superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body
physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional
superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence
of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called
magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05^{\circ}$, which are nevertheless very
fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the
topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an
interval of approximately $0.8^{\circ}<\theta<1.3^{\circ}$. As highlighted by a
simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking, induced by the
chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the
isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. The efficiency of the
cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter
coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results
demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical
devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic
phases in Moir\'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.

<br>
Dynamical mean-field theory describes the impact of strong local correlation
effects in many-electron systems. While the single-particle spectral function
is directly obtained within the formalism, two-particle susceptibilities can
also be obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The solution requires
handling infinite matrices in Matsubara frequency space. This is commonly
treated using a finite frequency cut-off, resulting in slow linear convergence.
We show that decomposing the two-particle response in local and non-local
contributions enables a reformulation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation inspired
by the dual boson formalism. The re-formulation has a drastically improved
cubic convergence with respect to the frequency cut-off, facilitating the
calculation of susceptibilities in multi-orbital systems considerably. The dual
Bethe-Salpeter equation uses the fully reducible vertex which is free from
vertex divergences. We benchmark the approach on several systems including the
spin susceptibility of strontium ruthenate Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, a strongly correlated
Hund's metal with three active orbitals. We propose the dual Bethe-Salpeter
equation as a new standard for calculating two-particle response within
dynamical mean-field theory.

<br>
<br>
We study the effects of the uniaxial tensile strain and shear deformation as
well as their combinations on the electronic properties of single-layer black
phosphorene. The evolutions of the strain-dependent band gap are obtained using
the numerical calculations within the tight-binding (TB) model as well as the
first-principles (DFT) simulations and compared with previous findings. The
TB-model-based findings show that the band gap of the strain-free phosphorene
agrees with the experimental value and linearly depends on both stretching and
shearing: increases (decreases) as the stretching increases (decreases),
whereas gradually decreases with increasing the shear. A linear dependence is
less or more similar as compared to that obtained from the ab initio
simulations for shear strain, however disagrees with a non-monotonic behaviour
from the DFT-based calculations for tensile strain. Possible reasons for the
discrepancy are discussed. In case of a combined deformation, when both strain
types (tensile/compression + shear) are loaded simultaneously, their mutual
influence extends the realizable band gap range: from zero up to the values
respective to the wide-band-gap semiconductors. At a switched-on combined
strain, the semiconductor-semimetal phase transition in the phosphorene is
reachable at a weaker (strictly non-destructive) strain, which contributes to
progress in fundamental and breakthroughs.

The experimental control of synergistic chemomechanical dynamics of

design of adaptive and biomimetic materials. Here, we report a minimalistic
model of feedback-controlled microreactors based on the coupling between the

for the internal chemical conversion. We categorize regimes of mono- and
bistability, excitability, damped oscillations, as well as sustained
oscillatory states with tunable amplitude, as indicated by experiments and
representable by the FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics for neurons. We summarize the
features of such a colloidal neuron in bifurcation diagrams with respect to
microgel design parameters, such as permeability and relaxation times, as a
guide for experimental synthesis.

We study the Wannier-Stark (WS) localization in one-dimensional
amplitude-chirped lattices with the $j$th onsite potential modulated by a
function $Fj\cos(2\pi \alpha j)$, where $F$ is the external field with a period
determined by $\alpha=p/q$ ($p$ and $q$ are co-prime integers). In the
Hermitian (or non-Hermitian) systems with real (or imaginary) fields, we can
obtain real (or imaginary) WS ladders in the eigenenergy spectrum. In most
cases with $q \geq 2$, there are multiple WS ladders with all the eigenstates
localized in the strong field limit. However, in the lattices with $q=4$, the
energy-dependent localization phenomenon emerges due to the competition between
spatially periodic and linearly increasing behaviors in the onsite potential.
About half the number of eigenstates are gathered at the band center and can
extend over a wide region or even the full range of the lattice, even when the
field becomes very strong. Moreover, in the non-Hermitian lattices with odd
$q$, some of the WS ladders become doubly degenerate, where the eigenstates are
evenly distributed at two neighboring sites in a wide regime of field strength.
Our work opens an avenue for exploring WS localization in both Hermitian and
non-Hermitian amplitude-chirped lattices.

Liquid metal batteries (LMBs) are a promising alternative for large-scale
stationary energy storage for renewable applications. Using high-abundance
electrode materials such as Sodium and Zinc is highly desirable due to their
low cost and excellent cell potential. LMBs undergo multiple complex mass
transport dynamics and as a result, their operation limits and other critical
parameters are not fully understood yet. In this work, a multiphase numerical
model was developed to resolve electrode and electrolyte components in 1D and
simulate the discharge process of a Na-Zn battery including the interfacial
displacement of the molten metal electrodes. The variation in electrolyte
composition was predicted throughout the process, including the species
distribution and its effect on the cell conductivity and capacity. Volume
change and species redistribution were found to be important in predicting the
maximum theoretical capacity of the cell when neglecting convective phenomena.

<h3>Phonon-phonon coupling in bismuth vanadate over a large temperature  range across the monoclinic phase</h3>

In this work we study phonon-phonon coupling in bismuth vanadate (BiVO4),
known for its second-order transition involving a variety of coupling
mechanisms. Using Raman spectroscopy as a probe, we identify two optical
coupled phonon modes of the VO4 tetrahedron and study them by varying light
polarization and temperature. The coupling manifests in non-Lorentzian
line-shapes of Raman peaks and frequency shifts. We use theoretical framework
of coupled damped harmonic oscillators to model the coupling and capture the
phenomena in the temperature evolution of the coupling parameters. The coupling
is negligible at temperatures below 100 K and later increases in magnitude with
temperature until 400 K. The sign of the coupling parameter depends on the
light polarization direction, causing either phonon attraction or repulsion.
After 400 K the phonon-phonon coupling diminishes when approaching phase
transition at which the phonon modes change their symmetry and the coupling is
no longer allowed.

We model the influence of an in-plane magnetic field on the orbital motion of
electrons in rhombohedral graphene multilayers. For zero field, the low-energy
band structure includes a pair of flat bands near zero energy which are
localized on the surface layers of a finite thin film. For finite field, we
find that the zero-energy bands persist and that level bifurcations occur at
energies determined by the component of the in-plane wave vector $q$ that is
parallel to the external field. The occurrence of level bifurcations is
explained by invoking semiclassical quantization of the zero field Fermi
surface of rhombohedral graphite. We find parameter regions with a single
isoenergetic contour of Berry phase zero corresponding to a conventional Landau
level spectrum and regions with two isoenergetic contours, each of Berry phase
$\pi$, corresponding to a Dirac-like spectrum of levels. We write down an
analogous one-dimensional tight-binding model and relate the persistence of the
zero-energy bands in large magnetic fields to a soliton texture supporting
zero-energy states in the Su-Schreiffer-Heeger model. We show that different
states contributing to the zero-energy flat bands in rhombohedral graphene
multilayers in a large field, as determined by the wave vector $q$, are
localized on different bulk layers of the system, not just the surfaces.

<br>
<br>
We study the frequency non-reciprocity of the spin waves in symmetric
CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnets stacks set in the scissors state by
in-plane applied fields. Using a combination of Brillouin Light Scattering and
propagating spin wave spectroscopy experiments, we show that the acoustical
spin waves in synthetic antiferromagnets possess a unique feature if their
wavevector is parallel to the applied field: the frequency non-reciprocity can
be so large that the acoustical spin waves transfer energy in a unidirectional
manner for a wide and bipolar interval of wavevectors. Analytical modeling and
full micromagnetic calculations are conducted to account for the dispersion
relations of the optical and acoustical spin waves for arbitrary field
orientations. Our formalism provides a simple and direct method to understand
and design devices harnessing propagating spin waves in synthetic
antiferromagnets.

<h3>Domain convexification: a simple model for invasion processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05273" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05273</a>
<br>
<i>David Martin-Calle, Olivier Pierre-Louis</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an invasion model where domains grow up to their convex hulls and
merge when they overlap. This model can be seen as a continuum and isotropic
counterpart of bootstrap percolation models. From numerical investigations of
the model starting with randomly scattered discs in two dimensions, we find an
invasion transition that occurs via macroscopic avalanches. The disc
concentration threshold and the sharpness of the transition are found to
decrease as the system size is increased. Our results are consistent with a
vanishing threshold in the limit of infinitely large system sizes. However this
limit could not be investigated by simulations. For finite initial
concentrations of discs, the cluster size distribution presents a power-law
tail characterized by an exponent that varies approximately linearly with the
initial concentration of discs. These results at finite initial concentration
open novel directions for the understanding of the transition in systems of
finite size. Furthermore, we find that the domain area distribution has
oscillations with discontinuities. In addition, the deviation from circularity
of large domains is constant. Finally, we compare our results to experimental
observations on de-adhesion of graphene induced by the intercalation of
nanoparticles.

<h3>Spin squeezing in mixed-dimensional anisotropic lattice models</h3>

<br>
<i>Mikhail Mamaev, Diego Barberena, Ana Maria Rey</i>
<br>
<br>
We describe a theoretical scheme for generating scalable spin squeezing with
nearest-neighbour interactions between spin-1/2 particles in a 3D lattice,
which are naturally present in state-of-the-art 3D optical lattice clocks. We
propose to use strong isotropic Heisenberg interactions within individual
planes of the lattice, forcing the constituent spin-1/2s to behave as large
collective spins. These large spins are then coupled with XXZ anisotropic
interactions along a third direction of the lattice. This system can be
realized via superexchange interactions in a 3D optical lattice subject to an
external linear potential, such as gravity, and in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) to generate spin anisotropic interactions. We show there is a
wide range of parameters in this setting where the spin squeezing improves with
increasing system size even in the presence of holes.

<h3>A physically motivated analytical expression for the temperature  dependence of the zero-field splitting of the nitrogen-vacancy center in  diamond</h3>

<br>
<br>
The temperature dependence of the zero-field splitting (ZFS) between the
$|m_{s}=0\rangle$ and $|m_{s}=\pm 1\rangle$ levels of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
center's electronic ground-state spin triplet can be used as a robust nanoscale
thermometer in a broad range of environments. However, despite numerous
measurements of this dependence in different temperature ranges, to our
knowledge no analytical expression has been put forward that captures the
scaling of the ZFS of the NV center across all relevant temperatures. Here we
present a simple, analytical, and physically motivated expression for the
temperature dependence of the NV center's ZFS that matches all experimental
observations, in which the ZFS shifts in proportion to the occupation numbers
of two representative phonon modes. In contrast to prior models our expression
does not diverge outside the regions of fitting. We show that our model
quantitatively matches experimental measurements of the ZFS from 15 to 500 K in
single NV centers in ultra-pure bulk diamond, and we compare our model and
measurements to prior models and experimental data.

<h3>Spontaneous Self-Constraint in Active Nematic Flows</h3>

Active processes drive and guide biological dynamics across scales -- from
subcellular cytoskeletal remodelling, through tissue development in
embryogenesis, to population-level bacterial colonies expansion. In each of
these, biological functionality requires collective flows to occur while
self-organized structures are protected; however, the mechanisms by which
active flows can spontaneously constrain their dynamics to preserve structure
have not previously been explained. By studying collective flows and defect
dynamics in active nematic films, we demonstrate the existence of a
self-constraint -- a two-way, spontaneously arising relationship between
activity-driven isosurfaces of flow boundaries and mesoscale nematic
structures. Our results show that self-motile defects are tightly constrained
to viscometric surfaces -- contours along which vorticity and strain-rate
balance. This in turn reveals that self-motile defects break mirror symmetry
when they move along a single viscometric surface, in contrast with
expectations. This is explained by an interdependence between viscometric
surfaces and bend walls -- elongated narrow kinks in the orientation field.
Although we focus on extensile nematic films, numerical results show the
constraint holds whenever activity leads to motile half-charge defects. This
mesoscale cross-field self-constraint offers a new framework for tackling
complex 3D active turbulence, designing dynamic control into biomimetic
materials, and understanding how biological systems can employ active stress
for dynamic self-organization.

<h3>Simulation of mechanical effects of hydrogen in bicrystalline Cu using  DFT and bond order potentials</h3>

<br>

Hydrogen embrittlement is a prime cause of several degradation effects in
metals. Since grain boundaries (GBs) act efficiently as sinks for hydrogen
atoms, H is thought to segregate in these regions, affecting the local
formation of dislocations. However, it remains unclear at which concentrations
H begins to play any role in the mechanical properties of Cu. In the current
study, we use density functional theory (DFT) to assess the accuracy of a bond
order potential (BOP) in simulating the segregation of H in Cu GB. BOP
accurately predicts the most favorable segregation sites of H in Cu GB, along
with the induced lattice relaxation effects. H is found to weaken the crystal
by reducing the GB separation energy. Classical molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations using BOP are performed to evaluate the concentration of H in
bicrystalline Cu required to substantially impact the crystal's mechanical
strength. For concentrations higher than 10 mass ppm, H significantly reduces
the yield strength of bicrystalline Cu samples during uniaxial tensile strain
application. This effect was attributed to the fact that H interstitials within
the GB promoted the formation of partial dislocations.

<h3>Olympicene radicals as building blocks of two-dimensional anisotropic  networks</h3>

I propose monoradical nanographenes without C3 symmetry as building blocks to
design two-dimensional (2D) carbon crystals. As representative examples I study
the honeycomb and Kagome lattices, showing that by replacing the sites with
olympicene radicals the band dispersion near the Fermi energy corresponds,
respectively, to that of Kekul\'e/anti-Kekul\'e graphene and breathing Kagome
tight-binding models. As a consequence, finite islands of these new crystals
present corner states close to the Fermi energy, just like the parent models.
In the case of Kekul\'e/anti-Kekul\'e graphene, such states are topologically
protected, standing as examples of second-order topological insulators with a
non-zero Z2- or Z6-Berry phase. Differently, those of the breathing Kagome
lattice are of trivial nature, but the ground state has been predicted to be a
spin liquid in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Hence, 2D systems made
of low-symmetric nanographenes may be convenient platforms to explore exotic
physics in carbon materials.

<h3>Athermal quasistatic cavitation in amorphous solids: effect of random  pinning</h3>

Amorphous solids are known to fail catastrophically via fracture, wherein
cavitation at nano-metric scales is known to play a significant role.
Micro-alloying via inclusions is often used as a means to increase the fracture
toughness of amorphous solids. Modeling such inclusions as randomly pinned
particles that move only affinely and do not participate in plastic relaxation,
we study how the pinning influences the process of cavitation-driven fracture
in an amorphous solid. Using extensive numerical simulations and probing in the
athermal quasistatic limit, we show that just by pinning a very small fraction
of particles, the tensile strength is increased and also the cavitation is
delayed. Further, the cavitation that is expected to be spatially heterogeneous
becomes spatially homogeneous by forming a large number of small cavities
instead of a dominant cavity.

Electroluminescence, a non-thermal radiative process, is ubiquitous in
semi-conductors and insulators but fundamentally precluded in metals. We show
here that this restriction can be circumvented in high-quality graphene. By
investigating the radiative emission of semi-metallic graphene field-effect
transistors over a broad spectral range, spanning the near- and mid-infrared,
we demonstrate direct far-field electroluminescence from hBN-encapsulated
graphene in the mid-infrared under large bias in ambient conditions. Through a
series of test experiments ruling out its incandescence origin, we determine
that the electroluminescent signal results from the electrical pumping produced
by interband tunneling. We show that the mid-infrared electroluminescence is
spectrally shaped by a natural quarter-wave resonance of the heterostructure.
This work invites a reassessment of the use of metals and semi-metals as
non-equilibrium light emitters, and the exploration of their intriguing
specificities in terms of carrier injection and relaxation, as well as emission
tunability and switching speed.

<h3>Epitaxial thin films of binary Eu-compounds close to a valence  transition</h3>

Intermetallic binary compounds of europium reveal a variety of interesting
phenomena due to the interconnection between two different magnetic and 4f
electronic (valence) states, which are particularly close in energy. The
valence states or magnetic properties are thus particularly sensitive to
strain-tuning in these materials. Consequently, we grew epitaxial EuPd$_2$
(magnetic Eu$^{2+}$) and EuPd$_3$ (nonmagnetic Eu$^{3+}$) thin films on
MgO(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Ambient X-ray diffraction
confirms an epitaxial relationship of cubic Laves-type (C15) EuPd$_2$ with an
(111)-out-of plane orientation, whereby four distinct in-plane crystallographic
domains develop. For simple cubic EuPd$_3$ two different out-of-plane
orientations can be obtained by changing the substrate annealing temperature
under ultra-high vacuum conditions from 600{\deg} C to 1000{\deg} C for one
hour. A small resistance minimum evolves for EuPd$_3$ thin films grown with low
temperature substrate annealing, which was previously found even in single
crystals of EuPd$_3$ and might be attributed to a Kondo or weak localization
effect. Absence of influence of an applied magnetic fields and magnetotransport
measurements suggest always a nonmagnetic ground state for EuPd$_3$ thin films,
i. e., a purely trivalent Eu valence, as previously found in EuPd3 single
crystals. For EuPd$_2$ magnetic ordering below ~72 K is observed, quite similar
to single crystal behaviour. Additional field dependent measurements of the
magnetoresistance and the Hall effect show hysteresis effects below ~0.4 T and
an anomalous Hall effect below ~70 K, which saturates around 1.4 T, thus
proving a ferromagnetic ground state of the divalent Eu.

Periodic boundary conditions are commonly applied in molecular dynamics
simulations in the microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT) and
isothermal-isobaric (NpT) ensembles. In their simplest application, a
biological system of interest is placed in the middle of a solvation box, which
is chosen 'sufficiently large' to minimize any numerical artefacts associated
with the periodic boundary conditions. This practical approach brings
limitations to the size of biological systems that can be simulated. Here, we
study simulations of effectively infinitely-long nucleic acids, which are
solvated in the directions perpendicular to the polymer chain, while periodic
boundary conditions are also applied along the polymer chain. We study the
effects of these asymmetric periodic boundary conditions (APBC) on the
simulated results, including the mechanical properties of biopolymers and the
properties of the surrounding solvent. To get some further insights into the
advantages of using the APBC, a coarse-grained worm-like chain model is first
studied, illustrating how the persistence length can be extracted from local
properties of the polymer chain, which are less affected by the APBC than some
global averages. This is followed by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of
DNA in ionic solutions, where we use the APBC to investigate sequence-dependent
properties of DNA molecules and properties of the surrounding solvent.

Quantum gas microscopes are versatile and powerful tools for fundamental
science as well as promising candidates for enticing applications such as in
quantum simulation or quantum computation. Here we present a quantum gas
microscopy setup for experiments with highly magnetic atoms of the lanthanoid
elements erbium and dysprosium. Our setup features a non-magnetic,
non-conducting, large-working-distance, high-numerical-aperture, in-vacuum
microscope objective, mounted inside a glue-free quartz glass cell. The quartz
glass cell is enclosed by a compact multi-shell ferromagnetic shield that
passively suppresses external magnetic field noise by a factor of more than a
thousand. Our setup will enable direct manipulation and probing of the rich
quantum many-body physics of dipolar atoms in optical lattices, and bears the
potential to put exciting theory proposals -- including exotic magnetic phases
and quantum phase transitions -- to an experimental test.
