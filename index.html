<h3>Phonon-mediated Hydrodynamic Transport in a Weyl Semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13245" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13245</a>

We analyze from a microscopic point of view the feasibility of a hydrodynamic
regime in a type-I Weyl semimetal driven by electron-electron interactions
mediated by virtual phonons. Considering also the effects of of impurities and
the absorption/emission of real phonons, the electric and thermal
conductivities are derived. At temperatures $T$ above the Bloch-Gr\"uneisen
temperature $T_\textrm{BG}$, virtual phonons behave similarly to real phonons,
but the Lorenz ratio is modified by a constant prefactor dependent on the Fermi
surface geometry. For temperatures below $T_\textrm{BG}$, processes that do not
conserve chirality induce a $T^2$ dependence in the electric resistivity,
opening a window where momentum-conserving interactions dominate transport
signatures. We quantitatively discuss this hydrodynamic window and put it into
context with recent experimental literature on the subject.

<br>
<br>
Controlling the temperature distribution inside catalytic fixed bed reactors
is crucial for yield optimization and process stability. Yet, in situ
temperature measurements with spatial and temporal resolution are still
challenging. In this work, we perform temperature measurements in a cylindrical
fixed bed reactor by combining the capabilities of real-time magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) with the temperature-dependent proton resonance frequency (PRF)
shift of water. Three-dimensional (3D) temperature maps are acquired while
heating the bed from room temperature to 60~$^{\circ}$C using hot air. The
obtained results show a clear temperature gradient along the axial and radial
dimensions and agree with optical temperature probe measurements with an
average error of $\pm$ 1.5~$^{\circ}$C. We believe that the MR thermometry
methodology presented here opens new perspectives for the fundamental study of
mass and heat transfer in gas-solid fixed beds and in the future might be
extended to the study of reactive gas-solid systems.

<h3>Inverted Sedimentation of Active Particles in Unbiased ac Fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13686</a>

<br>
<br>
Achieving control of the motion of active particles is crucial for
applications ranging from targeted cargo delivery to nanomedicine. While much
progress has been made recently to control active motion based on external
forces, flows or gradients in concentration or light intensity, which all have
a well-defined direction or bias, little is known about how to steer active
particles in situations where no permanent bias can be realized. Here, we show
that ac fields with a vanishing time average provide an alternative route to
steering active particles. We exemplify this route for inertial active
particles in a gravitational field, observing that a substantial fraction of
them persistently travels in the upward direction upon switching on the ac
field, resulting in an inverted sedimentation profile at the top wall of a
confining container. Our results offer a generic control principle which could
be used in the future to steer active motion, to direct collective behaviors
and to purify mixtures.

<h3>Atomistic modelling of all dislocations and twins in HCP and BCC Ti</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14072</a>
<br>
<i>Tongqi Wen, Anwen Liu, Rui Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Jian Han, Han Wang, David J. Srolovitz, Zhaoxuan Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Ti exhibits complex plastic deformation controlled by active dislocation and
twinning systems. Understandings on dislocation cores and twin interfaces are
currently not complete or quantitative, despite extensive experimental and
simulation studies. Here, we determine all the core and twin interface
properties in both HCP and BCC Ti using a Deep Potential (DP) and DFT. We
determine the core structures, critical resolved shear stresses and mobilities
of <a>, <c+a>, <c> dislocations in HCP and <111>/2 dislocations in BCC Ti. The
<a> slip consists of slow core migration on pyramidal-I planes and fast
migration on prism-planes, and is kinetically limited by cross-slips among
them. This behaviour is consistent with "locking-unlocking" phenomena in TEM
and is likely an intrinsic property. Large-scale DFT calculations provide a
peek at the screw <c+a> core and glide behaviour, which is further quantified
using DP-Ti. The screw <c+a> is unstable on pyramidal-II planes. The mixed
<c+a> is nearly sessile on pyramidal-I planes, consistent with observations of
long dislocations in this orientation. The edge and mixed <c+a> are unstable
against a pyramidal-to-basal (PB) transition and become sessile at high
temperatures, corroborate the difficulties in <c>-axis compression of Ti.
Finally, in BCC Ti, the <111>/2 screw has a degenerate core with average glide
on {112} planes; the <111>/2 edge and mixed dislocations have non-dissociated
cores on {110} planes. This work paints a self-consistent, complete picture on
all dislocations in Ti, rationalises previous experimental observations and
points to future HRTEM examinations of unusual dislocations such as the mixed
and PB transformed <c+a> cores.

<h3>Active responsive colloids driven by intrinsic dichotomous noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14164" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14164</a>
<br>
<i>Nils Göth, Upayan Baul, Joachim Dzubiella</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the influence of intrinsic noise on the structure and dynamics of
responsive colloids (RCs) which actively change their size and mutual
interactions. The colloidal size is explicitly resolved in our RC model as an
internal degree of freedom (DOF) in addition to the particle translation. A
Hertzian pair potential between the RCs leads to repulsion and shrinking of the
particles, resulting in an explicit responsiveness of the system to
self-crowding. To render the colloids active, their size is internally driven
by a dichotomous noise, randomly switching ('breathing') between growing and
shrinking states with a predefined rate, as motivated by recent experiments on
synthetic active colloids. The polydispersity of this dichotomous active
responsive colloid (D-ARC) model can be tuned by the parameters of the noise.
Utilizing stochastic computer simulations, we study crowding effects on the
spatial distributions, relaxation times, and self-diffusion of dense
suspensions of the D-ARCs. We find a substantial influence of the 'built-in'
intrinsic noise on the system's behavior, in particular, transitions from
unimodal to bimodal size distributions for an increasing colloid density as
well as intrinsic noise-modified diffusive translational dynamics. We conclude
that controlling the noise of internal DOFs of a macromolecule or cell is a
powerful tool for active colloidal materials to enable autonomous changes in
the system's collective structure and dynamics towards the adaption of
macroscopic properties to external perturbations.

<h3>Structural studies of the silica sol-gel glasses doped with copper  selenide nanoparticles with plasmonic resonance absorption</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14166</a>
<br>
<i>Valerij S. Gurin, Alexander A. Alexeenko</i>
<br>
<br>
Background: Semiconductor-doped glasses are treated actively through many
years and continue to be of great interest because challenged features of
nanosized semiconductors of various chemical nature. Copper chalcogenides have
discovered the plasmonic properties in line with quantum confinement effects
specific for major of semiconductor nanoparticles. Objective: The aim of this
work is to study structural and optical features of the sol-gel derived silica
glasses with copper selenide nanoparticles demonstrating appearance of the
plasmonic light absorption in the near IR range. Method: The samples under
study were fabricated through an original sol-gel technique realizing the
simultaneous synthesis of copper selenide and sintering of mesoporous silica.
The copper selenide glasses were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical absorption spectroscopy.
Results: Formation of nanocrystalline Cu2-xSe particles of the size range from
tens nm through 100-150 nm is established with XRD and TEM techniques. The
principal optical properties are presented by the featured absorption in the
visible and near-IR ranges. Eg was evaluated for the direct transitions in the
range of 2.10-2.36 eV. The plasmonic resonance in the nanoparticles due to
increased carrier concentration originated by intrinsic defectness of Cu2-xSe
nanoparticles with variable stoichiometry. Its energy can be controlled by
Cu/Se ratio in the synthesis procedure.

<h3>Reconfiguration, swelling and tagged monomer dynamics of a single  polymer chain in Gaussian and non-Gaussian active baths</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14224" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14224</a>
<br>
<i>Koushik Goswami, Subhasish Chaki, Rajarshi Chakrabarti</i>
<br>
<br>
In this topical review, we give an overview of the structure and dynamics of
a single polymer chain in active baths, Gaussian or non-Gaussian. The review
begins with the discussion of single flexible or semiflexible linear polymer
chains subjected to two noises, thermal and active. The active noise has either
Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution but has a memory, accounting for the
persistent motion of the active bath particles. This finite persistence makes
the reconfiguration dynamics of the chain slow as compared to the purely
thermal case and the chain swells. The active noise also results superdiffusive
or ballistic motion of the tagged monomer. We present all the calculations in
details but mainly focus on the analytically exact or almost exact results on
the topic, as obtained from our group in recent years. In addition, we briefly
mention important works of other groups and include some of our new results.
The review concludes with pointing out the implications of polymer chains in
active bath in biologically relevant context and its future directions.

<h3>Internal stresses analysis on welded joint in Grade 91 steel under creep  test: synchrotron DRX tests and modelling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13263" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13263</a>

<br>
<br>
The analysis and understanding of creep damage of Grade 91 steel welded
joints is an important topic in the energy industry. Creep tests on welded
joints were carried out at 600$^{\circ}$C, 100MPa and then interrupted at 0%,
10%, 30%, 50%, 80% of the expected life and after failure. Creep damage is
characterised by cavity bands located exclusively in the core of the sample in
the InterCritical Heat Affected Zone (ICHAZ). These samples were tested using
\textit{in situ} synchrotron XRD along the welded joint under creep conditions
for the different creep life time. The experimental results show a significant
strain evolution and creep damage characteristic on the welded joint, with a
local maximum at the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ). Following this, a finite element
creep strain analysis was performed for comparison with the experimental
results.

<h3>Understanding the impact of physicality on network structure</h3>

<br>
The emergence of detailed maps of physical networks, like the brain
connectome, vascular networks, or composite networks in metamaterials, whose
nodes and links are physical entities, have demonstrated the limits of the
current network science toolset. Indeed, link physicality imposes a
non-crossing condition that affects both the evolution and the structure of a
network, in a way that is not captured by the adjacency matrix alone, the
starting point of all graph-based approaches. Here we introduce a meta-graph
that helps us discover an exact mapping between linear physical networks and
independent sets, a central concept in graph theory. The mapping allows us to
analytically derive both the onset of physical effects and the emergence of a
jamming transition, and show that physicality impacts the network structure
even when the total volume of the links is negligible. Finally, we construct
the meta-graphs of several real physical networks, allowing us to predict
functional features, like synapse formation in the brain connectome, in
agreement with the empirical data. Overall, we find that once present,
physicality fundamentally alters the structure of a network, changes that must
be quantified to understand the underlying systems.

<h3>Asperity Shape and Gradient Elasticity in Flexoelectric/Triboelectric  Contacts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13275</a>
<br>
<i>Karl P. Olson, Laurence D. Marks</i>
<br>
<br>
The underlying mechanisms responsible for triboelectricity have yet to be
completely understood. We have previously proposed a model which explains
charge transfer in non-metals via band bending due to electromechanical,
especially flexoelectric, effects at deformed asperities coupled with work
function differences. Here, we investigate whether the shape of asperities is
important for triboelectricity. The results indicate that the shape is
important in general, since how the electromechanical response scales with
force and asperity size depends on the shape. This is qualitatively in
agreement with experimental results. Further, we discuss how the impact of the
shape depends on material, geometric, and electronic transport details.
Additionally, gradient elasticity is incorporated into the model. As asperity
contact is a nanoscale phenomenon, size-dependent mechanics can become
significant and give more physically reasonable results. In some cases, the
impact of gradient elasticity terms on the electromechanical potentials is very
large, indicating that standard elasticity theory is not enough to cover some
relevant cases in modelling triboelectricity.

<h3>Universal scaling in fractional dimension</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The concept of universality has shaped our understanding of many-body
physics, but is mostly limited to homogenous systems. Here, we present a first
study of universality on a non-homogeneous graph, the long-range diluted graph
(LRDG). Its scaling theory is controlled by a single parameter, the spectral
dimension $d_s$, which plays the role of the relevant parameter on complex
geometries. The graph under consideration allows us to tune the value of the
spectral dimension continuously and find the universal exponents as continuous
functions of the dimension. By means of extensive numerical simulations, we
probe the scaling exponents of a simple instance of O(N) symmetric models on
the LRDG showing quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction of
universal scaling in fractional dimensions.

<h3>Electronic structure, magnetic properties, spin orientation, and doping  effect in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13321</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
<br>
The layered material Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, with alternating stacking honeycomb
and triangular layers, is attracting considerable attention due to its rich
physical properties. Here, using density functional theory and classical Monte
Carlo (MC) methods, we systematically study this system. Near the Fermi level,
the states are mainly contributed by Te $5p$ orbitals hybridized with Mn $3d$
orbitals, resembling a charge transfer system. Furthermore, the spin
orientations of the ferrimagnetic (FiM) ground state display different
conductive behaviors when along the $ab$ plane or out-of-plane directions:
insulating vs. metallic states. The energy difference between the FiM [110]
insulating and FiM [001] metallic phases is very small($ \sim 0.71$ meV/Mn).
Changing the angle $\theta$ of spin orientation from in-plane to out-of-plane
directions, the band gaps of this system are gradually reduced, leading to an
insulator-metal transition, resulting in an enhanced electrical conductivity,
related to the colossal angular magnetoresistance (MR) effect. In addition, we
also constructed the magnetic phase diagram using the classical $XY$ spin model
studied with the MC method. Three magnetic phases were obtained including
antiferromagnetic order, noncollinear spin patterns, and FiM order. Moreover,
we also investigated the Se- and Ge- doping into the Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ system:
the FiM state has the lowest energy among the magnetic candidates for both Se-
or Ge- doped cases. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) decreases in the
Se-doped case because the Mn orbital moment is reduced as the doping $x$
increases. Due to the small spin-orbital coupling effect of Se, the
insulator-metal transition caused by the spin orientation disappears in the
Se-doped case, resulting in an insulating phase in the FiM [001] phase. This
causes a reduced colossal angular MR.

<h3>Simulating Superconducting Properties of Overdoped Cuprates: the Role of  Inhomogeneity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13338" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13338</a>
<br>
<i>Mainak Pal, Andreas Kreisel, W.A. Atkinson, P.J. Hirschfeld</i>
<br>
<br>
Theoretical studies of disordered $d$-wave superconductors have focused, with
a few exceptions, on optimally doped models with strong scatterers. Addressing
recent controversies about the nature of the overdoped cuprates, however,
requires studies of the weaker scattering associated with dopant atoms. Here we
study simple models of such systems in the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes
(BdG) framework, and compare to disorder-averaged results using the
self-consistent-T-matrix-approximation (SCTMA). Despite surprisingly linear in
energy behavior of the low-energy density of states even for quite disordered
systems, the superfluid density in such cases retains a quadratic
low-temperature variation of the penetration depth, unlike other BdG results
reported recently. We trace the discrepancy to smaller effective system size
employed in that work. Overall, the SCTMA performs remarkably well, with the
exception of highly disordered systems with strongly suppressed superfluid
density. We explore this interesting region where gap inhomogeneity dominates
measured superconducting properties, and compare with overdoped cuprates.

<h3>Quadristor: a novel device for superconducting electronics</h3>

We designed and experimentally demonstrated a four-terminal superconducting
device which can function as a non-latching (reversible) superconducting switch
from the diode regime to the resistive state by applying a control current much
smaller than the main transport current. The device utilizes a vortex-based
superconducting diode mechanism which is switched back and forth via the
injection of flux quanta through auxiliary current leads. Various applications
in superconducting electronics can be foreseen.

<h3>Properties of condensed matter from fundamental physical constants</h3>

<br>
Fundamental physical constants play a profound role in physics. For example,
they govern nuclear reactions, formation of stars, nuclear synthesis and
stability of biologically vital elements. These are high-energy processes
discussed in theoretical particle physics. More recently, it was realised that
fundamental physical constants extend their governing reach to low-energy
processes and properties operating in condensed matter systems, often in an
unexpected way. These properties are those we experience daily and can
routinely measure, including viscosity, thermal conductivity, elasticity and
sound. Here, we review this work. We start with the lower bound on liquid
viscosity, its origin and show how to relate the bound to fundamental physical
constants. The lower bound of kinematic viscosity represents the global minimum
on the phase diagram. We show how this result answers the long-standing
question considered by Purcell and Weisskopf, namely why viscosity never falls
below a certain value. An accompanying insight is that water viscosity and
water-based life are well attuned to fundamental constants. We then discuss
viscosity minima in liquid He above and below the $\lambda$-point. We
subsequently consider a very different property, thermal diffusivity, and show
that it has the same minimum fixed by fundamental physical constants as
viscosity. We also discuss bounds related to elastic properties, elastic moduli
and their analogues in low-dimensional systems, and show how these bounds are
related to the upper bound for the speed of sound. We conclude with listing
ways in which the discussion of fundamental constants and bounds advance
physical theories.

<h3>Topological phonon analysis of the 2D buckled honeycomb lattice: an  application to real materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13346" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13346</a>
<br>
<i>Martin Gutierrez-Amigo, Maia G. Vergniory, Ion Errea, J. L. Mañes</i>
<br>
<br>
By means of group theory, topological quantum chemistry, first-principles and
Monte Carlo calculations, we analyze the topology of the 2D buckled honeycomb
lattice phonon spectra. Taking the pure crystal structure as an input, we show
that eleven distinct phases are possible, five of which necessarily have
non-trivial topology according to topological quantum chemistry. Another four
of them are also identified as topological using Wilson loops in an analytical
model that includes all the symmetry allowed force constants up to third
nearest neighbors, making a total of nine topological phases. We then compute
the ab initio phonon spectra for the two-dimensional crystals of Si, Ge, P, As
and Sb in this structure and construct its phase diagram. Despite the large
proportion of topological phases found in the analytical model, all of the
crystals lie in a trivial phase. By analyzing the force constants space using
Monte Carlo calculations, we elucidate why topological phonon phases are
physically difficult to realize in real materials with this crystal structure.

<h3>Scattering Expansion for Localization in One Dimension: from Disordered  Wires to Quantum Walks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13368</a>
<br>
<i>Adrian B. Culver, Pratik Sathe, Rahul Roy</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a perturbative approach to a broad class of disordered systems in
one spatial dimension. Considering a long chain of identically disordered
scatterers, we expand in the reflection strength of any individual scatterer.
This expansion accesses the full range of phase disorder from weak to strong.
We apply this expansion to several examples, including the Anderson model, a
general class of periodic-on-average-random potentials, and a two-component
discrete-time quantum walk, showing analytically in the latter case that the
localization length can depend non-monotonically on the strength of phase
disorder (whereas expanding in weak disorder yields monotonic decrease).
Returning to the general case, we extend the perturbative derivation of
single-parameter scaling to another order and obtain to all orders a particular
non-separable form for the joint probability distribution of the
log-transmission and reflection phase. Furthermore, we show that for weak local
reflection strength, a version of the scaling theory of localization holds: the
joint distribution is determined by just three parameters.

<h3>Structural, hydrogen bonding and dipolar properties of alkyl  imidazolium-based ionic liquids: a classical and first-principles molecular  dynamics study</h3>

<br>
Ionic liquids (ILs) feature a tailorable and wide range of structural,
chemical and electronic properties that make this class of materials suitable
to a broad variety of forefront applications in next-generation electronics.
Yet, their intrinsic complexity call for special attention and experimental
probes have still limitations in unraveling the interactions occurring both in
the bulk IL and at the interface with the solid substrates used to build the
devices. This works provides an atomistic insight into these fundamental
interactions by molecular modeling to complement the information still not
accessible to experiments. In particular, we shed some light on the nature of
the chemical bonding, structure, charge distribution and dipolar properties of
a series of alkyl-imidazolium-based ILs by a synergy of classical and
first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Special emphasis is given to
the crucial issue of the hydrogen bond network formation ability depending
either on the nature of the anion or on the length of the alkyl chain of the
cation. The hydrogen bond strength is a fundamental indicator of the cohesive
and ordering features of the ILs and, in this respect, might be exploited to
foster a different behaviour of the IL used a bulk medium or when used in
electronic devices.

Nanoscale BaTiO$_3$ particles (~10 nm) prepared by ball-milling a mixture of
oleic acid and heptane have been reported to have an electric polarization
several times larger than that for bulk BaTiO$_3$. In this work, detailed
local, intermediate, and long-range structural studies are combined with
spectroscopic measurements to develop a model structure of these materials. The
X-ray spectroscopic measurements reveal large Ti off-centering as the key
factor producing the large spontaneous polarization in the nanoparticles.
Temperature-dependent lattice parameter changes reveal the sharpening of the
structural phase transitions in these BaTiO$_3$ nanoparticles compared to the
pure nanoparticle systems. Sharp crystalline-type peaks in the barium oleate
Raman spectra suggest that this component in the composite core-shell matrix, a
product of mechanochemical synthesis, stabilizes an enhanced polar structural
phase of the BaTiO$_3$ core nanoparticles.

<h3>Large Magnetic-Field-Induced Strains in Sintered Chromium Tellurides</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sintered samples of Cr3Te4 and Cr2Te3 are found to show large strains
accompanied by large volume changes under a magnetic field. In Cr3Te4, volume
increases of deltaV/V = 500-1170 ppm by applying a magnetic field of 9 T are
observed over the entire temperature range below 350 K. At room temperature,
the deltaV/V value exceeds 1000 ppm, which is considerably larger than the
maximum values reported for Cr-based magnets thus far and is comparable to the
room-temperature value of forced-volume magnetostriction in invar alloys.
Cr2Te3 show a large deltaV/V of 680 ppm when applying a magnetic field of 9 T
at 200 K. Both samples display particularly large volume increases around the
Curie temperature, where they also show negative thermal expansion due to
microstructural effects, suggesting that the cooperation between anisotropic
lattice deformation associated with the magnetic ordering and microstructural
effects is essential for the manifestation of the large magnetic-field-induced
volume changes.

Cubic CeZn shows a structural phase transition under pressure, and it
modifies the ground state from an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to a
ferromagnetic (FM) state. To investigate how the FM state terminates at a
quantum phase transition, we measured the electrical resistivity under pressure
for a single crystal CeZn. The transition temperature into the FM state
decreases monotonously with increasing pressure, accompanied by the pronounced
Kondo effect, but a drastic change in the field response occurs before the
ordered phase terminates. This result suggests that the FM quantum critical
point is avoided by the appearance of an AFM-like state.

The mixed valence Cr compound NaCr$_2$O$_4$, synthesized using a
high-pressure technique, offers a unique playground for investigating
unconventional physical properties in condensed matter. In the present study,
muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) and high-resolution neutron powder
diffraction (NPD) measurements were carried out to clarify the true magnetic
ground state of this interesting compound. Our detailed study brings new
insight, allowing us to confirm the existence of a commensurate
antiferromagnetic order (C-AFM) and to extract its ordered Cr moment $\mu^{\rm
C}_{\rm Cr}=(4.30\pm0.01)\mu_B$. Such a value of the ordered moment is in fact
compatible with the existence of high-spin Cr sites. Further, the value of the
canting angle of the Cr spin axial vector is refined as $\theta_{\rm
c}=(8.8\pm0.5)^{\circ}$. Employing high-quality samples in combination with
time-of-flight NPD, a novel magnetic supercell was also revealed. Such
supercell display an incommensurate (IC)-AFM propagation vector
(0~0~${\textstyle \frac{1}{2}-}\delta$), having an ordered moment $\mu^{\rm
IC}_{\rm Cr}=(2.20\pm0.03)\mu_B$. It is suggested that the C-AFM and IC-AFM
modulations are due to itinerant and localized contributions to the magnetic
moment, respectively. Finally, the direct measurement of the magnetic order
parameter provided a value of the critical exponent $\beta = 0.245 \approx
\frac{1}{4}$, suggesting a non conventional critical behavior for the magnetic
phase transition in NaCr$_2$O$_4$.

We study the crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) regime to the
Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime in a quasi-two-dimensional quantum gas
of ultracold fermionic atoms. Using an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian
with renormalized interactions between atoms and dressed molecules within a
Gaussian pair fluctuation theory, we investigate how Fermi superfluidity is
affected by reduced dimensionality at zero temperature in a wide range of
crossover. We observe that the order parameter and pair size show universal
relations with the chemical potential on the BCS side, irrespective of
dimensionality. However, such universal dependences break down towards the BEC
limit with increasing interaction strength. This results reveal the notable
effect of reduced dimenionality on pairing physics, which can also be observed
in the sound velocity and convexity parameter of the Goldstone mode. We compare
our results with the latest experiments in both ${}^{6}$Li atomic gases and
layered nitrides LixZrNCl and find good agreements.

<h3>Critical behaviour of the extended-ballistic transition for pulled  self-avoiding walks</h3>

In order to study the competition of pulling a long chain polymer with its
other system properties models of lattice polymers accomodate an applied
pulling force to some part of a lattice polymer in addition to features such as
energetic interaction between the lattice polymer and a surface. However, the
critical behaviour of the pulling force alone is less well studied, such as
characterizing the nature of the phase transition and particularly the values
of the associated exponents. We investigate a simple model of lattice polymers
subject to forced extension, namely self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on the square
and simple cubic lattices with one endpoint attached to an impermeable surface
and a force applied to the other endpoint acting perpendicular to the surface.
In the thermodynamic limit the system undergoes a transition to a ballistic
phase as the force is varied and it is known that this transition occurs
whenever the magnitude of the force is positive, i.e. $f>f_\text{c}=0$. Using
well established scaling arguments we show that the crossover exponent $\phi$
for the finite-size model is identical to the well-known exponent $\nu_d$,
which controls the scaling of the size of the polymer in $d$-dimensions. With
extensive Monte Carlo simulations we test this conjecture and show that the
value of $\phi$ is indeed consistent with the known values of $\nu_2 = 3/4$ and
$\nu_3 = 0.587 597(7)$. Scaling arguments, in turn, imply the specific heat
exponent $\alpha$ is $2/3$ in two dimensions and $0.29815(2)$ in three
dimensions.

<h3>Influence of non-local damping on magnon properties of ferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the influence of non-local damping on magnon properties of Fe, Co,
Ni and Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ ($x=30\%,50\%$) alloys. The Gilbert damping parameter
is typically considered as a local scalar both in experiment and in theoretical
modelling. However, recent works have revealed that Gilbert damping is a
non-local quantity that allows for energy dissipation between atomic sites.
With the Gilbert damping parameters calculated from a state-of-the-art
real-space electronic structure method, magnon lifetimes are evaluated from
spin dynamics and linear response, where a good agreement is found between
these two methods. It is found that non-local damping affects the magnon
lifetimes in different ways depending on the system. Specifically, we find that
in Fe, Co, and Ni the non-local damping decreases the magnon lifetimes, while
in $\rm Fe_{70}Co_{30}$ and Fe$_{50}$Co$_{50}$ an opposite, non-local damping
effect is observed, and our data show that it is much stronger in the former.

<h3>Shape matters: Competing mechanisms of particle shape segregation</h3>

<br>
<br>
It is well-known that granular mixtures that differ in size or shape
segregate when sheared. In the past, two mechanisms have been proposed to
describe this effect, and it is unclear if both exist. To settle this question,
we consider a bidisperse mixture of spheroids of equal volume in a rotating
drum, where the two mechanisms are predicted to act in opposite directions. We
present the first evidence that there are two \emph{distinct} segregation
mechanisms driven by relative \emph{over-stress}. Additionally, we showed that
for non-spherical particles, these two mechanisms can act in different
directions leading to a competition between the effects of the two. As a
result, the segregation intensity varies non-monotonically as a function of
$AR$, and at specific points, the segregation direction changes for both
prolate and oblate spheroids, explaining the surprising segregation reversal
previously reported. Consistent with previous results, we found that the
kinetic mechanism is dominant for (almost) spherical particles. Furthermore,
for moderate aspect ratios, the kinetic mechanism is responsible for the
spherical particles segregation to the periphery of the drum, and the gravity
mechanism plays only a minor role. Whereas, at the extreme values of $AR$, the
gravity mechanism notably increases and overtakes its kinetic counterpart.

Highly uniform quantum systems are essential for the practical implementation
of scalable quantum processors. While quantum dot spin qubits based on
semiconductor technology are a promising platform for large-scale quantum
computing, their small size makes them particularly sensitive to their local
environment. Here, we present a method to electrically obtain a high degree of
uniformity in the intrinsic potential landscape using hysteretic shifts of the
gate voltage characteristics. We demonstrate the tuning of pinch-off voltages
in quantum dot devices over hundreds of millivolts that then remain stable at
least for hours. Applying our method, we homogenize the pinch-off voltages of
the plunger gates in a linear array for four quantum dots reducing the spread
in pinch-off voltage by one order of magnitude. This work provides a new tool
for the tuning of quantum dot devices and offers new perspectives for the
implementation of scalable spin qubit arrays.

Microstructure reconstruction, a major component of inverse computational
materials engineering, is currently advancing at an unprecedented rate. While
various training-based and training-free approaches are developed, the majority
of contributions are based on generative adversarial networks. In contrast,
diffusion models constitute a more stable alternative, which have recently
become the new state of the art and currently attract much attention. The
present work investigates the applicability of diffusion models to the
reconstruction of real-world microstructure data. For this purpose, a highly
diverse and morphologically complex data set is created by combining and
processing databases from the literature, where the reconstruction of realistic
micrographs for a given material class demonstrates the ability of the model to
capture these features. Furthermore, a fiber composite data set is used to
validate the applicability of diffusion models to small data set sizes that can
realistically be created by a single lab. The quality and diversity of the
reconstructed microstructures is quantified by means of descriptor-based error
metrics as well as the Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) score. Although not
present in the training data set, the generated samples are visually
indistinguishable from real data to the untrained eye and various error metrics
are computed. This demonstrates the utility of diffusion models in
microstructure reconstruction and provides a basis for further extensions such
as 2D-to-3D reconstruction or application to multiscale modeling and
structure-property linkages.

<h3>Kauzmann Paradox: a crossover due to diminishing local excitations?</h3>

<br>
<br>
The configurational entropy of supercooled liquids extrapolates to zero at
the Kauzmann temperature, causing a crisis called the Kauzmann paradox. Here,
using a class of multicomponent lattice glass models, we study a resolution of
the paradox characterized by a sudden but smooth turn in the entropy as
temperature goes sufficiently low. A scalar variant of the models reproduces
the Kauzmann paradox with thermodynamic properties at very low temperatures
dominated by correlations. An exactly solvable vector variant without
correlation illustrates that a sudden entropy turn occurs when discrete local
excitations are largely suppressed. Despite being disordered and infinitely
degenerate, the ground states have zero entropy per particle.

<h3>Unravelling the role of Sm 4f electrons in the magnetism of SmFeO$_3$</h3>

<br>
Magnetic rare-earth orthoferrites $R$FeO$_3$ host a variety of functional
properties from multiferroicity and strong magnetostriction, to
spin-reorientation transitions and ultrafast light-driven manipulation of
magnetism, which can be exploited in spintronics and next-generation devices.
Among these systems, SmFeO$_3$ is attracting a particular interest for its rich
phase diagram and the high temperature Fe-spin magnetic transitions, which
combines with a very low temperature and as yet unclear Sm-spin ordering.
Various experiments suggest that the interaction between the Sm and Fe magnetic
moments (further supported by the magnetic anisotropy), is at the origin of the
complex cascade of transitions, but a conclusive and clear picture has not yet
been reached. In this work, by means of comprehensive first-principles
calculations, we unravel the role of the magnetic Sm ions in the Fe-spin
reorientation transition and in the detected anomalies in the lattice
vibrational spectrum, which are a signature of a relevant spin-phonon coupling.
By including both Sm-$f$ electrons and non-collinear magnetism, we find
frustrated and anisotropic Sm interactions, and a large magnetocrystalline
anisotropy mediated by the SOC of the Sm-$4f$ electrons, which drive the
complex magnetic properties and phase diagram of SmFeO$_3$.

<h3>Detachment of a rigid flat punch from a viscoelastic material</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that the detachment of a flat punch from a viscoelastic substrate has
a relatively simple behavior, framed between the Kendall's elastic solution at
the relaxed modulus and at the instantaneous modulus, and the cohesive strength
limit. We find hardly any dependence of the pull-off force on the details of
the loading process, including maximum indentation at preload and loading rate,
resulting much simpler than the case of a spherical punch. Pull-off force peaks
at the highest speeds of unloading, when energy dissipation is negligible,
which seems to be in contrast with what suggested by the theories originated by
de Gennes of viscoelastic semi-infinite crack propagation which associated
enhanced work of adhesion to dissipation. Further qualitative differences with
the dissipation-based model occur to explain the finite size effect.

We study the features of the superconductivity nucleation and vortex
configurations in superconductors with modulated disorder. Using the
Ginzburg-Landau-type theory with spatially varying diffusion coefficient, we
uncover and explain the switching between the vortex-defect attraction to the
repulsion upon the increase in the external magnetic field. It is shown that
for rather weak applied magnetic fields, a superconducting nucleus localized
near the region with the suppressed diffusion coefficient possesses a nonzero
vorticity whereas the increase in the magnetic field can lead to a transition
into the state with zero winding number. We demonstrate the manifestations of
this switching phenomenon in superconductors with a large number of defects by
performing numerical simulations of the vortex structures in superconductors
with periodic spatial profiles of the diffusion coefficient. The obtained
results clarify the physics of the vortex arrangement in several classes of the
superconducting materials including one-dimensional superlattices and
nanopatterned superconductors with regular arrays of the defects characterized
by the increased concentration of nonmagnetic impurities.

We consider a gas of repulsive $N$-component fermions confined in a
ring-shaped potential, subject to an effective magnetic field. For large
repulsion strengths, we work out a Bethe ansatz scheme to compute the two-point
correlation matrix and then the one-particle density matrix. Our results holds
in the mesoscopic regime of finite but sufficiently large number of particles
and system size that are not accessible by numerics. We access the momentum
distribution of the system and analyse its specific dependence of interaction,
magnetic field and number of components $N$. In the context of cold atoms, the
exact computation of the correlation matrix to determine the interference
patterns that are produced by releasing cold atoms from ring traps is carried
out.

Experiments have observed superconductivity in atomically-thin metallic
layers deposited on semiconducting substrates. As in any superconductor, it is
important to determine the structure of the superconducting pairing function in
order to reveal the mechanism responsible for superconductivity. To that end,
we study the possible superconducting states of two-dimensional triangular
lattices. We calculate the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns which
would result from various nearest-neighbor pairing order parameters, and show
how the QPI can be used to distinguish between those order parameters. The QPI
patterns are the momentum-space representations of real-space local
density-of-states fluctuations: the QPI signal at momentum $q$ reveals the
strength of scattering processes at that momentum transfer. We show how
characteristic differences between scattering from charge disorder (i.e.
impurities) and from order-parameter disorder (i.e. vortices) can be used to
identify the angular momentum of the superconducting pairs.

<h3>Topological features of Haldane model on a dice lattice: role of flat  band on transport properties</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the topological properties of a Haldane model on a band deformed
dice lattice, which has three atoms per unit cell (call them as A, B and C) and
the spectrum comprises of three bands, including a flat band. The bands are
systematically deformed with an aim to study the evolution of topology and the
transport properties. The deformations are induced through hopping anisotropies
and are achieved in two distinct ways. In one of them, the hopping amplitudes
between the sites of B and C sublattices and those between A and B sublattices
are varied along a particular direction, and in the other, the hopping between
the sites of A and B sublattices are varied (keeping B-C hopping unaltered)
along the same direction. The first case retains some of the spectral features
of the familiar dice lattice and yields Chern insulating lobes in the phase
diagram with $C=\pm2$ till a certain critical deformation. The topological
features are supported by the presence of a pair of chiral edge modes at each
edge of a ribbon and the plateaus observed in the anomalous Hall conductivity
support the above scenario. Whereas, a selective tuning of only the A-B hopping
amplitudes distorts the flat band and has important ramifications on the
topological properties of the system. The insulating lobes in the phase diagram
have distinct features compared to the case above, and there are dips observed
in the Hall conductivity near the zero bias. The dip widens as the hopping
anisotropy is made larger, and thus the scenario registers significant
deviation from the familiar plateau structure observed in the anomalous Hall
conductivity. However, a phase transition from a topological to a trivial
insulating region demonstrated by the Chern number changing discontinuously
from $\pm2$ to zero beyond a certain critical hopping anisotropy remains a
common feature in the two cases.

Alchemical free energy calculations are widely used in predicting pKa, and
binding free energy calculations in biomolecular systems. These calculations
are carried out using either Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) or Thermodynamic
Integration (TI). Numerous efforts have been made to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of such calculations, especially by boosting conformational
sampling. In this paper, we use a technique that enhances the conformational
sampling by temperature acceleration of collective variables for alchemical
transformations and applies it to the prediction of pKa of the buried Asp 26
residue in thioredoxin protein. We discuss the importance of enhanced sampling
in the pKa calculations. The effect of the solvent models in the computed pKa
values is also presented.

Sorbent materials are a promising alternative to advance hydrogen storage
technologies. The general disadvantage is the relatively weak solid-gas
interaction and adsorption energy, providing low gravimetric and volumetric
capacities and extreme operational conditions. Here we propose Au-doped carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) as an efficient alternative for reversible hydrogen capture at
high temperatures. This work investigates the properties of several modified
CNTs using density functional theory. We analyze the binding and formation
energies of the uniformed Au-doped CNTs and assess their adsorption capability.
The hydrogen storage mechanisms of the nanostructures are studied in depth
using partial density of states and charge transfer analysis showing that the
increase of diameter has a positive effect on the outcome. Our findings show
that the modified structures are able to capture from six to nine hydrogen
molecules per gold atom, achieving volumetric capacities ranging from 154 to
330 g/l, surpassing the DOE target. In addition, the calculated desorption
temperatures indicate high performance of Au-doped CNTs, obtaining hydrogen
capture-release working conditions above 200 K.

Motivated by recent experiments and computational results on pyrochlore
iridates, we compare single-particle properties of Y2Ir2O7 obtained from
single-site dynamical mean-field calculations with results within the TRILEX
approximation, where the latter takes non-local correlations into account. Our
calculations are all based on ab-initio calculations within density-functional
theory, and take spin-orbit coupling into account. In order to make the
treatment within TRILEX feasible, we first define a single-band jeff = 1/2
model, by comparing its spectral features within DMFT to a three-band model
that includes both jeff = 1/2 and jeff = 3/2 orbitals. Our calculations show
consistently a paramagnetic metallic phase at small interaction values, and an
insulating antiferromagnetic phase at larger interaction values. The critical
interactions, however, differ between single-site and TRILEX calculations. The
antiferromagnetic phase shows the already predicted all-in/all-out magnetic
ordering. Different to the single-site results, the TRILEX calculation gives
also evidence for the Weyl-semimetal regime in the vicinity of the
metal-insulator transition.

Solid state wafers are indispensable components in material science as
substrates for epitaxial homo- or hetero-structures or carriers for
two-dimensional materials. However, a reliable determination of magnetic
properties of nanomaterials in volume magnetometry is frequently affected by
unexpectedly rich magnetism of these substrates, including significant magnetic
anisotropy. Here, we describe a simplified experimental routine of magnetic
anisotropy assessment, which we exemplify and validate for epi-ready sapphire
wafers from various sources. Both the strength and the sign of magnetic
anisotropy is obtained from carefully designed temperature dependent
measurements, which mitigate all known pitfalls of volume SQUID magnetometry
and are substantially faster than traditional approaches. Our measurements
indicate that in all the samples two types of net paramagnetic contributions
coexists with diamagnetism. The first one can be as strong as 10% of the base
diamagnetism of sapphire [-3.7(1) x 10-7 emu/gOe], and, when exceeds 2% mark,
it exhibits pronounced magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis oriented
perpendicularly to the face of c-plane wafers. The other is much weaker but
exhibit ferromagnetic-like appearance. These findings form an important message
that non-standard magnetism of common substrates can significantly influence
the results of precise magnetometry of nanoscale materials and its existence
must be taken for granted by both industry and academia.

Studies of structure-property relationships in spintronics are essential for
the design of materials that can fill specific roles in devices. For example,
materials with low symmetry allow unconventional configurations of
charge-to-spin conversion which can be used to generate efficient spin-orbit
torques. Here, we explore the relationship between crystal symmetry and
geometry of the Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) that causes spin accumulation in
response to an applied electric current. Based on a symmetry analysis performed
for 230 crystallographic space groups, we identify classes of materials that
can host conventional or collinear REE. Although transverse spin accumulation
is commonly associated with the so-called 'Rashba materials', we show that the
presence of specific spin texture does not easily translate to the
configuration of REE. More specifically, bulk crystals may simultaneously host
different types of spin-orbit fields, depending on the crystallographic point
group and the symmetry of the specific $k$-vector, which, averaged over the
Brillouin zone, determine the direction and magnitude of the induced spin
accumulation. To explore the connection between crystal symmetry, spin texture,
and the magnitude of REE, we perform first-principles calculations for
representative materials with different symmetries. We believe that our results
will be helpful for further computational and experimental studies, as well as
the design of spintronics devices.

Recent years have seen a growing interest in topological phases beyond the
standard paradigm of gapped, isolated systems. One recent direction is to
explore topological features in non-hermitian systems that are commonly used as
effective descriptions of open systems. Another direction explores the fate of
topology at critical points, where the bulk gap collapses. One interesting
observation is that both systems, though very different, share certain
topological features. For instance, both systems can host half-integer
quantized winding numbers and have very similar entanglement spectra. Here, we
make this similarity explicit by showing the equivalence of topological
invariants in critical systems with non-hermitian point-gap phases, in the
presence of sublattice symmetry. This correspondence may carry over to other
features beyond topological invariants, and may even be helpful to deepen our
understanding of non-hermitian systems using our knowledge of critical systems,
and vice versa.

We demonstrate that Cherenkov radiation can be manipulated in terms of
operation frequency, bandwidth, and efficiency by simultaneously controlling
the properties of drifting electrons and the photonic states supported by their
surrounding media. We analytically show that the radiation rate strongly
depends on the momentum of the excited photonic state, in terms of magnitude,
frequency dispersion, and its variation versus the properties of the drifting
carriers. This approach is applied to design and realize miniaturized,
broadband, tunable, and efficient terahertz and far-infrared sources by
manipulating and boosting the coupling between drifting electrons and
engineered hyperbolic modes in graphene-based nanostructures. The broadband,
dispersive, and confined nature of hyperbolic modes relax momentum matching
issues, avoid using electron beams, and drastically enhance the radiation rate
- allowing that over 90% of drifting electrons emit photons. Our findings open
a new paradigm for the development of solid-state terahertz and infrared
sources.

<h3>Realizability of Iso-$g_2$ Processes via Effective Pair Interactions</h3>

An outstanding problem in statistical mechanics is the determination of
whether prescribed functional forms of the pair correlation function $g_2(r)$
[or equivalently, structure factor $S(k)$] at some number density $\rho$ can be
achieved by $d$-dimensional many-body systems. The Zhang-Torquato conjecture
states that any realizable set of pair statistics, whether from a
nonequilibrium or equilibrium system, can be achieved by equilibrium systems
involving up to two-body interactions.
In light of this conjecture, we study the realizability problem of the
nonequilibrium iso-$g_2$ process, i.e., the determination of density-dependent
effective potentials that yield equilibrium states in which $g_2$ remains
invariant for a positive range of densities.
Using a precise inverse methodology that determines effective potentials that
match hypothesized functional forms of $g_2(r)$ for all $r$ and $S(k)$ for all
$k$, we show that the unit-step function $g_2$, which is the zero-density limit
of the hard-sphere potential, is remarkably numerically realizable up to the
packing fraction $\phi=0.49$ for $d=1$. For $d=2$ and 3, it is realizable up to
the maximum ``terminal'' packing fraction $\phi_c=1/2^d$, at which the systems
are hyperuniform, implying that the explicitly known necessary conditions for
realizability are sufficient up through $\phi_c$.
For $\phi$ near but below $\phi_c$, the large-$r$ behaviors of the effective
potentials are given exactly by the functional forms $\exp[-\kappa(\phi) r]$
for $d=1$, $r^{-1/2}\exp[-\kappa(\phi) r]$ for $d=2$, and
$r^{-1}\exp[-\kappa(\phi) r]$ (Yukawa form) for $d=3$, where
$\kappa^{-1}(\phi)$ is a screening length, and for $\phi=\phi_c$, the
potentials at large $r$ are given by the pure Coulomb forms in the respective
dimensions, as predicted by Torquato and Stillinger [\textit{Phys. Rev. E}, 68,
041113 1-25 (2003)].

<h3>Metrics for the violation of detailed balance in microwave circuits:  theory and experiment</h3>

<i>Alexandre Dumont, Pierre Février, Christian Lupien, Bertrand Reulet</i>

<br>
We propose a new approach to detailed balance violation in electrical
circuits by relying on the scattering matrix formalism commonly used in
microwave electronics. This allows to include retardation effects which are
paramount at high frequencies. We define the spectral densities of phase space
angular momentum, heat transfer and cross power, which can serve as criteria
for detailed balance violation. We confirm our theory with measurements in the
4-8 GHz frequency range on several two port circuits of varying symmetries, in
space and time. This validates our approach, which will allow to treat quantum
circuits at ultra-low temperature.

<h3>Two-dimensional diffusiophoretic colloidal banding: Optimizing the  spatial and temporal design of solute sinks and sources</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13795" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13795</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In this work, we numerically investigate the impact of two-dimensional solute
gradients on the distribution of colloidal particles, i.e., colloidal banding,
induced via diffusiophoresis. The solute gradients are generated by spatially
arranged sources and sinks that emit/absorb a time-dependent solute flux. First
we study a dipole system, i.e., one source and one sink, and discover that
interdipole diffusion and flux decay timescales dictate colloidal banding. At
timescales shorter than the interdipole diffusion timescale, we observe a rapid
enhancement in particle enrichment around the source due to repulsion from the
sink. However, at timescales longer than the interdipole diffusion timescale,
the source and sink screen each other, leading to a slower enhancement. If the
solute flux decays at the timescale of interdipole diffusion, an optimal
separation distance is obtained such that particle enrichment is maximized. We
find that the partition coefficient between solute inside the source and the
bulk strongly impacts the optimal separation distance. Surprisingly, the
diffusivity ratio between solute in the source and bulk has a much weaker
impact on the optimal dipole separation distance. We also examine an octupole
configuration, i.e., four sinks and four sources, arranged in a circle, and
demonstrate that the geometric arrangement that maximizes enrichment depends on
the radius of the circle. If the radius of the circle is small, it is preferred
to have sources and sinks arranged in an alternating fashion. However, if the
radius of the circle is large, a consecutive arrangement of sources and sinks
is optimal. Our numerical framework introduces a novel method for spatially and
temporally designing the banded structure of colloidal particles in two
dimensions using diffusiophoresis and opens up new avenues in a field that has
primarily focused on one-dimensional solute gradients.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by several claims of spin-orbit driven spin-liquid physics in
hexagonal Ba$_3$Ti$_{3-x}$Ir$_x$O$_9$ hosting Ir2O9 dimers, we report on
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ir L3 edge for different x.
We demonstrate that magnetism in Ba$_3$Ti$_{3-x}$Ir$_x$O$_9$ is governed by an
unconventional realization of strong disorder, where cation disorder affects
the character of the local moments. RIXS interferometry, studying the RIXS
intensity over a broad range of transferred momentum q, is ideally suited to
assign different excitations to different Ir sites. We find pronounced Ir-Ti
site mixing. Both ions are distributed over two crystallographically
inequivalent sites, giving rise to a coexistence of quasimolecular singlet
states on Ir2O9 dimers and spin-orbit entangled j=1/2 moments of 5d$^5$
Ir$^{4+}$ ions. RIXS reveals different kinds of strong magnetic couplings for
different bonding geometries, highlighting the role of cation disorder for the
suppression of long-range magnetic order in this family of compounds.

Multi-principal element materials (MPEMs) have been attracting a rapidly
growing interest due to their exceptional performance under extreme conditions,
from cryogenic conditions to extreme-high temperatures and pressures. Despite
the simple conceptual premise behind their formation, computational
high-throughput first-principles design of such materials is extremely
challenging due to the large number of realizations required for sufficient
statistical sampling of their design space. Furthermore, MPEMs are also known
to develop short-ranged orderings (SROs) which can play a significant role in
their stability and properties. Here, we present an expedient and efficient
first-principles computational framework for assessing the compositional and
mechanical properties of MPEMs, including SRO effects. This heuristic
methodology systematically corrects phase-averaged free-energies of MPEMs to
include SRO phases, while imposing constraints for materials design. To
illustrate the methodology, we study the stability and mechanical properties of
equi-molar refractory-metal high-entropy alloy carbonitrides (RHEA-CNs) such as
ZrNbMoHfTaWC3N3. We show that SRO, arising due to preferential neighboring
among refractory metals, is necessary for thermodynamic and mechanical
stability and to satisfy the imposed design criteria, leading to complex
compositions for which their molar fraction and mechanical properties are
predicted.

<h3>Chiral magnons in altermagnetic RuO2</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnons in ferromagnets have one chirality, and typically are in the GHz
range and have a quadratic dispersion near the zero wavevector. In contrast,
magnons in antiferromagnets are commonly considered to have bands with both
chiralities that are degenerate across the entire Brillouin zone, and to be in
the THz range and to have a linear dispersion near the center of the Brillouin
zone. Here we theoretically demonstrate a new class of magnons on a
prototypical $d$-wave altermagnet RuO$_2$ with the compensated antiparallel
magnetic order in the ground state. Based on density-functional-theory
calculations we observe that the THz-range magnon bands in RuO$_2$ have an
alternating chirality splitting, similar to the alternating spin splitting of
the electronic bands, and a linear magnon dispersion near the zero wavevector.
We also show that, overall, the Landau damping of this metallic altermagnet is
suppressed due to the spin-split electronic structure, as compared to an
artificial antiferromagnetic phase of the same RuO$_2$ crystal with
spin-degenerate electronic bands and chirality-degenerate magnon bands.

<h3>Non-monotonic behavior of timescales of passage in heterogeneous media:  Dependence on the nature of barriers</h3>

Usually time of passage across a region may be expected to increase with the
number of barriers along the path. Can this intuition fail depending on the
special nature of the barrier? We study experimentally the transport of a
robotic bug which navigates through a spatially patterned array of obstacles.
Depending on the nature of the obstacles we call them either entropic or
energetic barriers. For energetic barriers we find that the timescales of first
passage vary non-monotonically with the number of barriers, while for entropic
barriers first passage times increase monotonically. We perform an exact
analytic calculation to derive closed form solutions for the mean first passage
time for different theoretical models of diffusion. Our analytic results
capture this counter-intuitive non-monotonic behaviour for energetic barriers.
We also show non-monotonic effective diffusivity in the case of energetic
barriers. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show this non-monotonic
behaviour for energetic barriers continues to hold true for super-diffusive
transport. These results may be relevant for timescales of intra-cellular
biological processes.

<h3>Reentrant phase transitions involving glassy and superfluid orders in  the random hopping Bose-Hubbard model</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study a system of strongly correlated bosons with off-diagonal disorder,
i.e., randomness in the kinetic energy, and find a family of reentrant phase
transitions that occur as a function of the on-site interaction. We model the
system using the paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with a random hopping
term and solve it employing the replica trick and Trotter-Suzuki expansion
known from quantum spin-glasses. From subsequent numerical calculations, we
find three distinct phase boundaries at which the reentrant transitions occur:
between glass and disordered phase, between superglass and superfluid ones, and
between superfluid and disordered phases. All three happen at temperatures
slightly above critical temperatures of corresponding non-interacting systems.
When the emerging and disappearing order is glassy, this corresponds to the
interplay of the thermal energy and the spread of hoppings. When superfluidity
is involved, thermal fluctuations must slightly overcome the mean hopping in
turn for the reentrance to occur.

Superconducting quantum interference device arrays have been extensively
studied for their high magnetic field sensitivity. The performance of these
devices strongly depends on the characteristic parameters of their Josephson
junctions, i.e. their critical currents and shunt resistances. Using a
resistively shunted junction model and including thermal noise, we perform a
numerical investigation of the effects of asymmetric Josephson junctions by
independently studying variations in the critical currents and junction
resistances. We compare the voltage response of a dc-SQUID with a 1D parallel
SQUID array and study the maximum transfer function dependence on the number of
junctions in parallel, the screening parameter and thermal noise strength. Our
results show that the maximum transfer function and linearity increase with the
number of junctions in parallel for arrays with different junction resistances,
in contrast to SQUID arrays with identical junctions or with spreads in the
critical currents.

<h3>Optimizing Transport of Majorana Zero Modes in One-Dimensional  Topological Superconductors</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Topological quantum computing is based on the notion of braiding non-Abelian
anyons, such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), to perform gate operations. A
crucial building block of these protocols is the adiabatic shuttling of MZMs
through topological superconductors. Here, we consider the "piano key"
approach, where MZMs are transported using local electric gates to tune
sections ("keys") of a wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial
phases. We numerically simulate this transport on a single wire and calculate
the diabatic error corresponding to exciting the system. We find that this
error is typically reduced when transport is facilitated by using multiple keys
as one may expect from modelling each piano key press as an effective
Landau-Zener process. However, further increasing the number of keys increases
errors; thus, there exists a non-trivial optimal number of keys that minimizes
the diabatic error given a fixed total shuttle time. As we show, this optimal
number of keys can be explained by modelling each key press as an effective
Landau-Zener process while paying careful attention to power-law corrections
that arise due to the non-analytic behaviour of the time-dependent modulation
of the chemical potential at the beginning and end of each key press.

<h3>Single-walled Ising nanotube with opposite sign of interactions using  Wang-Landau algorithm</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Arul Anne Elden, M. Ponmurugan</i>
<br>
<br>
The effect of opposite sign of interactions in a single-walled Ising nanotube
is investigated using the Wang-Landau algorithm. The thermodynamic observables
are calculated from the estimated density of states (DOS) with and without the
presence of an external magnetic field. Irrespective of the applied magnetic
field, a symmetric trend of DOS is observed for opposite sign of interactions
which is in contrast to the asymmetric trend for same sign of interactions.
Further, two types of anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) orderings, namely A-type and
C-type anti-ferromagnetic order, are observed for opposite sign of
interactions. These AFM spin orientations are switched to ferromagnetic (FM)
phase by increasing the applied magnetic field ($B$). However, the spin
ordering changes from the ordered AFM/FM phase to a disordered paramagnetic
phase by increasing the temperature. Phase diagram shows that these three
phases coexist around $B=2.0$. This study indicates that, by properly tuning
the magnetic properties, the single-walled nanotube can be used for fabrication
of new types of magnetic storage nano materials.

<h3>Non-local spin correlation as a signature of Ising anyons trapped in  vacancies of the Kitaev spin liquid</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the Kitaev chiral spin liquid, Ising anyons are realized as Majorana zero
modes bound in $Z_2$ fluxes, which, however, are thermal excitations with
finite decay rates. On the other hand, a lattice vacancy traps a $Z_2$ flux
even in the ground state, resulting in the stable realization of a Majorana
zero mode in the $Z_2$ flux. We demonstrate that spin-spin correlation
functions between two vacancy sites exhibit long-range correlation arising from
the fractionalized character of Majorana zero modes, in spite of the strong
decay of bulk spin correlations. Remarkably, this non-local spin correlation
does not decrease as the distance between two vacancy sites increases,
signaling teleportation of Majorana zero modes. Furthermore, we clarify that
the non-local correlation can be detected electrically via the measurement of
non-local conductance between two vacancy sites, which is also utilized for the
readout of Majorana qubits. These findings pave the way to the
measurement-based quantum computation with Ising anyons trapped in vacancies of
the Kitaev spin liquid.

Understanding the interplay of structural and electronic symmetry breaking in
Fe-based high temperature superconductors remains of high interest. In this
work we grow strain-patterned multilayer FeSe thin films in a range of
thicknesses using molecular beam epitaxy. We study the formation of electronic
nematic domains and spatially-varying strain using scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy. We directly visualize the formation of edge
dislocations that give rise to a two-dimensional edge dislocation network in
the films. Interestingly, we observe a 45 degree in-plane rotation of the
dislocation network as a function of film thickness, yielding antisymmetric
strain along different directions. This results in different coupling ratios
between electronic nematic domains and antisymmetric strain. Lastly, we are
able to distinguish between different orthogonal nematic domains by revealing a
small energy-dependent difference in differential conductance maps between the
two regions. This could be explained by orbital-selective tip-sample tunneling.
Our observations bring new insights into the dislocation network formation in
epitaxial thin films and provide another nanoscale tool to explore electronic
nematicity in Fe-based superconductors.

We systematically synthesized perovskite-type oxides Sr1-xCaxCoO3 containing
unusually high valence Co4+ ions by a high pressure technique, and investigated
the effect of systematic lattice change on the magnetic and electronic
properties. As the Ca content x exceeds about 0.6, the structure changes from
cubic to orthorhombic, which is supported by the first-principles calculations
of enthalpy. Upon the orthorhombic distortion, the ground state remains to be
apparently ferromagnetic with a slight drop of the Curie temperature.
Importantly, the compounds with x larger than 0.8 show antiferromagnetic
behavior with positive Weiss temperatures and nonlinear magnetization curves at
lowest temperature, implying that the ground state is noncollinear
antiferromagnetic or helimagnetic. Considering the incoherent metallic behavior
and the suppression of the electronic specific heat at high x region, the
possible emergence of a helimagnetic state in Sr1-xCaxCoO3 is discussed in
terms of the band-width narrowing and the double-exchange mechanism with the
negative charge transfer energy as well as the spin frustration owing to the
next-nearest neighbor interaction.

While undergoing gelation transition, a material passes through a distinctive
state called the critical gel state. In the neighborhood of this critical gel
state, how viscosity, equilibrium modulus, and relaxation times evolve are
correlated by scaling relations, and their universality has been validated for
materials undergoing the sol to gel transition. In this work, we extend this
approach for the gel to sol transition of a thermoresponsive polymeric system
of aqueous Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) gel that passes through the critical
state upon increasing temperature. We observe that, in the neighborhood of the
critical gel state, the equilibrium modulus and viscosity demonstrate a power
law dependence on the relative distance from the critical state in terms of
normalized temperature. Furthermore, the relaxation times in the gel and the
sol state shows symmetric power law divergence near the critical state. The
corresponding critical power law exponents and the dynamic critical exponents
computed at the critical gel to sol transition state validate the scaling and
hyperscaling relations originally proposed for the critical sol to gel
transition very well. Remarkably, the dependence of complex viscosity on
frequency at different temperatures shows a comprehensive mastercurve
irrespective of the temperature ramp rate independently in the gel and the sol
state. This observation demonstrates how the shape of relaxation time spectrum
is independent of both the temperature as well as the ramp rate. Since sol to
gel as well as the gel to sol transitions are opposite to each other, the
applicability of the scaling relations validated in this work suggests broader
symmetry associated with how the structure evolves around the critical state
irrespective of the direction.

<br>
The present work aims to address the electronic and magnetic properties of
the intermetallic compound GdPd$_2$Bi through a comprehensive study of the
structural, magnetic, electrical and thermal transport on a polycrystalline
sample, followed by theoretical calculations. Our findings indicate that the
magnetic ground state is antiferromagnetic in nature. Magnetotransport data
present prominent hysteresis loop hinting a structural transition with further
support from specific heat and thermopower measurements, but no such signature
is observed in the magnetization study. Temperature dependent powder x-ray
diffraction measurements confirm martensitic transition from the
high-temperature (HT) cubic Heusler $L2_1$ structure to the low-temperature
(LT) orthorhombic $Pmma$ structure similar to many previously reported shape
memory alloys. The HT to LT phase transition is characterized by a sharp
increase in resistivity associated with prominent thermal hysteresis. Further,
we observe robust Bain distortion between cubic and orthorhombic lattice
parameters related by $a_{orth} = \sqrt{2}a_{cub}$, $b_{orth} = a_{cub}$ and
$c_{orth} = a_{cub}/\sqrt{2}$, that occurs by contraction along $c$-axis and
elongation along $a$-axis respectively. The sample shows an unusual
`non-saturating' $H^2$-dependent negative magnetoresistance for magnetic field
as high as 150 kOe. In addition, non-linear field dependence of Hall
resistivity is observed below about 30 K, which coincides with the sign change
of the Seebeck coefficient. The electronic structure calculations confirm
robust metallic states both in the LT and HT phases. It indicates complex
nature of the Fermi surface along with the existence of both electron and hole
charge carriers. The anomalous transport behaviors can be related to the
presence of both electron and hole pockets.

The conductance of graphene nanoribbons and nanoconstrictions under the
effect of a scanning gate microscopy tip is systematically studied. Using a
scattering approach for noninvasive probes, the first- and second-order
conductance corrections caused by the tip potential disturbance are expressed
explicitly in terms of the scattering states of the unperturbed structure.
Numerical calculations confirm the perturbative results, showing that the
second-order term prevails in the conductance plateaus, exhibiting a universal
scaling law for armchair graphene strips. For stronger tips, at specific probe
potential widths and strengths beyond the perturbative regime, the conductance
corrections reveal the appearance of resonances originated from states trapped
below the tip. The zero-transverse-energy mode of an armchair metallic strip is
shown to be insensitive to the long-range electrostatic potential of the probe.
For nanoconstrictions defined on a strip, scanning gate microscopy allows to
get insight into the breakdown of conductance quantization. The first-order
correction generically dominates at low tip strength, while for Fermi energies
associated with faint conductance plateaus, the second-order correction becomes
dominant for relatively small potential tip strengths. In accordance with the
spatial dependence of the partial local density of states, the largest
tip-effect occurs in the central part of the constriction, close to the edges.
Nanoribbons and nanoconstrictions with zigzag edges exhibit a similar response
than in the case of armchair nanostructures, except when the intervalley
coupling induced by the tip potential destroys the chiral edge states.

Topological electromagnetism owing to nontrivial momentum-space topology of
electrons in insulators gives rise to diverse anomalous magnetoelectric
responses. While conventional inductors and capacitors are based on classical
electromagnetism described by Maxwell's equations, here we show that
topological electromagnetism in combination with spin dynamics in magnets also
generates an inductance or a capacitance. We build a generic framework to
extract the complex impedance on the basis of topological field theory, and
demonstrate the emergence of an inductance or a capacitance in several
heterostructure setups. In comparison with the previously-studied emergent
inductances in metallic magnets, insulators highly suppress the power loss,
because of the absence of Joule heating. We show that the inductance from
topological electromagnetism is achieved at low current and high frequency, and
is also advantageous in its power efficiency, as characterized by the high
quality factor (Q-factor).

The one-band and three-band Hubbard models which describe the electronic
structure of cuprates indicate very different values of effective electronic
parameters (EPs), such as the Cu on-site Coulomb energy and the Cu-O
hybridization strength. In contrast, a comparison of EPs of several cuprates
with corresponding values from spectroscopy and scattering experiments
indicates similar values in the three-band model and cluster model calculations
used to simulate experimental results. To explore this relation in detail, a
Cu$_2$O cluster model calculation was carried out to obtain an expression for
the Heisenberg exchange coupling $J$ between Cu sites using a downfolding
method, taking into account Cu and O on-site correlations ($U_d$ and $U_p$),
the charge-transfer energy $\Delta$ and the hopping $t$ between Cu and O sites.
A quantitative analysis provides a consistent description of $J$ from neutron
scattering experiments, using the three-band model and spectroscopic EPs. In
addition, $J$ can be expressed in the one-band Hubbard model form with
$\tilde{U}$ and $\tilde{t}$, which denote renormalized $U$ and $t$ using
$\Delta$ and $U_p$, and their values indicate a large $\tilde{U}/\tilde{t}$, in
agreement with reported values. The large $\tilde{U}/\tilde{t}$ arising from a
combination of $U_d$, $U_p$ and $\Delta$ is thus hidden in the effective
one-band Hubbard model. The ground-state singlet weights obtained from an exact
diagonalization show the importance of the Cu-O Zhang-Rice singlet in the
effective one-band Hubbard model. The results provide a consistent method to
connect EPs obtained from spectroscopy and the three-band model with values of
$J$ obtained from scattering experiments, band dispersion measurements and the
effective one-band Hubbard model.

Efficient numerical algorithm for stochastic differential equation has been
an important object in the research of statistical physics and mathematics for
a long time. In this paper we study the highly accurate numerical algorithm of
the overdamped Langevin equation. In particular, our interest is the behaviour
of the numerical schemes for solving the overdamped Langevin equation in the
harmonic system. Three algorithms are obtained for overdamped Langevin
equation, from the large friction limit of the schemes for underdamped Langevin
dynamics. We derive the explicit expression of the stationary distribution of
each algorithm by analysing the discrete time trajectory, for both
one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases. The accuracy of the stationary
distribution of each algorithm is illustrated by comparing to the exact
Boltzmann distribution. Our results demonstrate that, the "BAOA-limit"
algorithm generates the exact distribution for the harmonic system in the
canonical ensemble, within the stable regime of the time interval. The other
algorithms do not produce the exact distribution of the harmonic system.

Background: The determination of yield stress curves for ductile metals from
uniaxial material tests is complicated by the presence of tri-axial stress
states due to necking. A need exists for a straightforward solution to this
problem. Objective: This work presents a simple solution for this problem
specific to axis-symmetric specimens. Equivalent uniaxial true strain and true
stress, corrected for triaxiality effects, are calculated without resorting to
inverse analysis methods. Methods: A computer program is presented which takes
shadow images from tensile tests, obtained in a backlight configuration. A
single camera is sufficient as no stereoscopic effects need to be addressed.
The specimen's contours are digitally extracted, and strain is calculated from
the contour change. At the same time, stress triaxiality is computed using a
novel curvature fitting algorithm. Results: The method is accurate as
comparison with manufactured solutions obtained from Finite Element simulations
show. Application to 303 stainless steel specimens at different levels of
stress triaxiality show that equivalent uniaxial true stress -- true strain
relations are accurately recovered. Conclusions: The here presented computer
program solves a long-standing challenge in a straightforward manner. It is
expected to be a useful tool for experimental strain analysis.

<h3>Potts model with invisible states on a scale-free network</h3>

<br>
<i>P. Sarkanych, M. Krasnytska</i>
<br>
<br>
Different models are proposed to understand magnetic phase transitions
through the prism of competition between the energy and the entropy. One of
such models is a $q$-state Potts model with invisible states. This model
introduces $r$ invisible states such that if spin lies in one of them, it does
not interact with the rest. We consider such a model using the mean field
approximation on an annealed scale-free network where the probability of a
randomly chosen vertex having a degree $k$ is governed by the power-law
$P(k)\propto k^{-\lambda}$. Our results confirm that $q,r$ and $\lambda$ play a
role of global parameters that influence the critical behaviour of the system.
Depending on their values the phase diagram is divided into three regions with
different critical behaviour. However, the topological influence, presented by
the marginal value of $\lambda_c(q)$, has proven to be dominant over the
entropic one, governed by the number of invisible states $r$.

<br>
<br>
We consider dense, associative neural-networks trained with no supervision
and we investigate their computational capabilities analytically, via a
statistical-mechanics approach, and numerically, via Monte Carlo simulations.
In particular, we obtain a phase diagram summarizing their performance as a
function of the control parameters such as the quality and quantity of the
training dataset and the network storage, valid in the limit of large network
size and structureless datasets. Moreover, we establish a bridge between
macroscopic observables standardly used in statistical mechanics and loss
functions typically used in the machine learning. As technical remarks, from
the analytic side, we implement large deviations and stability analysis within
Guerra's interpolation to tackle the not-Gaussian distributions involved in the
post-synaptic potentials while, from the computational counterpart, we insert
Plefka approximation in the Monte Carlo scheme, to speed up the evaluation of
the synaptic tensors, overall obtaining a novel and broad approach to
investigate neural networks in general.

<h3>Dynamic correlations in the conserved Manna sandpile</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14070" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14070</a>
<br>
<i>Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan</i>
<br>
<br>
We study dynamic correlations for current and mass, as well as the associated
power spectra, in the one-dimensional conserved Manna sandpile. We show that,
in the thermodynamic limit, the variance of cumulative bond current up to time
$T$ grows subdiffusively as $T^{1/2-\mu}$ with the exponent $\mu \ge 0$
depending on the density regimes considered and, likewise, the power spectra of
current and mass at low frequency $f$ varies as $f^{1/2+\mu}$ and
$f^{-3/2+\mu}$, respectively; our theory predicts that, far from criticality,
$\mu = 0$ and, near criticality, $\mu = (\beta+1)/2 \nu_{\perp} z > 0$ with
$\beta$, $\nu_{\perp}$ and $z$ being the order-parameter, correlation-length
and dynamic exponents, respectively. The anomalous suppression of fluctuations
near criticality signifies a ``dynamic hyperuniformity'', characterized by a
set of fluctuation relations, in which current, mass and tagged-particle
displacement fluctuations are shown to have a precise quantitative relationship
with the density-dependent activity (or, it's derivative). In particular, the
relation, ${\mathcal{D}}_s(\bar{\rho}) = a(\bar{\rho}) / \bar{\rho}$, between
the self-diffusion coefficient ${\mathcal{D}}_s(\bar{\rho})$, activity
$a(\bar{\rho})$ and density $\bar{\rho}$ explains a previous simulation
observation [Eur. Phys. J. B \textbf{72}, 441 (2009)] that, near criticality,
the self-diffusion coefficient in the Manna sandpile has the same scaling
behavior as the activity.

We numerically study the general valley polarization and anomalous Hall
effect in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on monolayer jacutingaite
family materials Pt$_{2}$AX$_{3}$ (A = Hg, Cd, Zn; X = S, Se, Te). We perform a
systematic study on the atomic, electronic, and topological properties of vdW
heterostructures composed of monolayer Pt$_{2}$AX$_{3}$ and two-dimensional
ferromagnetic insulators. We show that four kinds of vdW heterostructures
exhibit valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase, i.e.,
Pt$_{2}$HgS$_{3}$/NiBr$_{2}$, Pt$_{2}$HgSe$_{3}$/CoBr$_{2}$,
Pt$_{2}$HgSe$_{3}$/NiBr$_{2}$, and Pt$_{2}$ZnS$_{3}$/CoBr$_{2}$, with a maximum
valley splitting of 134.2 meV in Pt$_{2}$HgSe$_{3}$/NiBr$_{2}$ and sizable
global band gap of 58.8 meV in Pt$_{2}$HgS$_{3}$/NiBr$_{2}$. Our findings

field parallel to the three principal crystallographic directions, revealing
anisotropies and magnetic transitions in this material. To account for the
observed results, we formulate a microscopic spin model with a bi-axial
single-ion anisotropy and inter-plane exchange. Theoretical calculations give
an excellent description of full magnon spectra enabling us to precisely

<h3>Symmetric Exclusion Process under Stochastic Power-law Resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14120" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14120</a>
<br>
<i>Seemant Mishra, Urna Basu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the behaviour of a symmetric exclusion process in the presence of
non-Markovian stochastic resetting, where the configuration of the system is
reset to a step-like profile at power-law waiting times with an exponent
$\alpha$. We find that the power-law resetting leads to a rich behaviour for
the currents, as well as density profile. We show that, for any finite system,
for $\alpha<1$, the density profile eventually becomes uniform while for
$\alpha >1$, an eventual non-trivial stationary profile is reached. We also
find that, in the limit of thermodynamic system size, at late times, the
average diffusive current grows $\sim t^\theta$ with $\theta = 1/2$ for $\alpha
\le 1/2$, $\theta = \alpha$ for $1/2 < \alpha \le 1$ and $\theta=1$ for $\alpha
> 1$. We also analytically characterize the distribution of the diffusive
current in the short-time regime using a trajectory-based perturbative
approach. Using numerical simulations, we show that in the long-time regime,
the diffusive current distribution follows a scaling form with an
$\alpha-$dependent scaling function. We also characterise the behaviour of the
total current using renewal approach. We find that the average total current
also grows algebraically $\sim t^{\phi}$ where $\phi = 1/2$ for $\alpha \le 1$,
$\phi=3/2-\alpha$ for $1 < \alpha \le 3/2$, while for $\alpha > 3/2$ the
average total current reaches a stationary value, which we compute exactly. The
variance of the total current also shows an algebraic growth with an exponent
$\Delta=1$ for $\alpha \le 1$, and $\Delta=2-\alpha$ for $1 < \alpha \le 2$,
whereas it approaches a constant value for $\alpha>2$. The total current
distribution remains non-stationary for $\alpha<1$, while, for $\alpha>1$, it
reaches a non-trivial and strongly non-Gaussian stationary distribution, which
we also compute using the renewal approach.

<br>
Silicon offers the enticing opportunity to integrate hybrid quantum-classical
computing systems on a single platform. For qubit control and readout,
high-frequency signals are required. Therefore, devices that can facilitate its
generation are needed. Here, we present a quantum dot-based radiofrequency
multiplier operated at cryogenic temperatures. The device is based on the
non-linear capacitance-voltage characteristics of quantum dot systems arising
from their low-dimensional density of states. We implement the multiplier in a
multi-gate silicon nanowire transistor using two complementary device
configurations: a single quantum dot coupled to a charge reservoir and a
coupled double quantum dot. We study the harmonic voltage conversion as a
function of energy detuning, multiplication factor and harmonic phase noise and
find near ideal performance up to a multiplication factor of 10. Our results
demonstrate a method for high-frequency conversion that could be readily
integrated into silicon-based quantum computing systems and be applied to other
semiconductors.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the ability of selective cavity coupling to a topological
chain for tailoring the connectivity of Majorana fermions. We show how
topological qubits (TQs), associated with non-local Majorana fermion pairing,
can be moved from the edge to the bulk of a topological chain through selective
access to light-matter interaction with specific physical sites. In particular,
we present a comprehensive DMRG study of ground-state features in different
chain-cavity coupling geometries and validate analytical insights in the strong
coupling regime. This new kind of Majorana fermion correlation generation
process comes with new cavity photon features. Moreover, by considering the
time evolution after a sudden quench of the cavity-matter coupling strength, we
show that the development of high non-trivial matter (Majorana) correlations
leaves off measurable non-classical photon imprints in the cavity. New ways to
dynamically generate TQ nonlocal correlations in topological chains of
arbitrary length are thus provided, opening alternative routes to controllable
long-range entanglement in hybrid photonic solid-state systems.

<h3>Electronic phase diagram of Cr-doped VO2 epitaxial films studied by in  situ photoemission spectroscopy</h3>

<i>D. Shiga, X. Cheng, T. T. Kim, T. Kanda, N. Hasegawa, M. Kitamura, K. Yoshimatsu, H. Kumigashira</i>
<br>
<br>
Through in situ photoemission spectroscopy (PES), we investigated the changes
in the electronic structure of Cr-doped VO2 films coherently grown on TiO2
(001) substrates. The electronic phase diagram of CrxV1-xO2 is drawn by a
combination of electric and spectroscopic measurements. The phase diagram is
similar to that of bulk CrxV1-xO2, while the temperature of metal-insulator
transition (TMIT) is significantly suppressed by the epitaxial strain effect.
In the range of x = 0-0.04, where TMIT remains unchanged as a function of x,
the PES spectra show dramatic change across TMIT, demonstrating the
characteristic spectral changes associated with the Peierls phenomenon. In
contrast, for x > 0.04, the TMIT linearly increases, and the metal-insulator
transition (MIT) may disappear at x = 0.08-0.12. The PES spectra at x = 0.08
exhibit pseudogap behavior near the Fermi level, whereas the characteristic
temperature-induced change remains almost intact, suggesting the existence of
local V-V dimerization. The suppression of V-V dimerization with increasing x
was confirmed by polarization-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy. These
spectroscopic investigations reveal that the energy gap and V 3d states are
essentially unchanged with 0 $\le$ x $\le$ 0.08 despite the suppression of V-V
dimerization. The invariance of the energy gap with respect to x suggests that
the MIT in CrxV1-xO2 arises primarily from the strong electron correlations,
namely the Peierls-assisted Mott transition. Meanwhile, the pseudogap at x =
0.08 eventually evolves to a full gap (Mott gap) at x = 0.12, which is
consistent with the disappearance of the temperature-dependent MIT in the
electronic phase diagram. These results demonstrate that a Mott insulating
phase without V-V dimerization is stabilized at x > 0.08 as a result of the
superiority of Mott instability over the Peierls one.

<h3>Universality of grain boundary phases in fcc metals: Case study on  high-angle [111] symmetric tilt grain boundaries</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Grain boundaries often exhibit ordered atomic structures. Increasing amounts
of evidence have been provided by transmission electron microscopy and
atomistic computer simulations that different stable and metastable grain
boundary structures can occur. Meanwhile, theories to treat them
thermodynamically as grain boundary phases have been developed. Whereas atomic
structures were identified at particular grain boundaries for particular
materials, it remains an open question if these structures and their
thermodynamic excess properties are material specific or generalizable to,
e.g., all fcc metals. In order to elucidate that question, we use atomistic
simulations with classical interatomic potentials to investigate a range of
high-angle [111] symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Au, Al, and
Pb. We could indeed find two families of grain boundary phases in all of the
investigated grain boundaries, which cover most of the standard fcc materials.
Where possible, we compared the atomic structures to atomic-resolution electron
microscopy images and found that the structures match. This poses the question
if the grain boundary phases are simply the result of sphere-packing geometry
or if material-specific bonding physics play a role. We tested this using
simple model pair potentials and found that medium-ranged interactions are
required to reproduce the atomic structures, while the more realistic material
models mostly affect the grain boundary (free) energy. In addition to the
structural investigation, we also report the thermodynamic excess properties of
the grain boundaries, explore how they influence the thermodynamic stability of
the grain boundary phases, and detail the commonalities and differences between
the materials.

<br>
<br>
We establish a two-parameter state diagram for soft spherical particles at
the limit where grain inertia can be ignored. At high packing densities, the
occurrence of repetitive quaking in an intermediate range of dimensionless
shear rates is a direct consequence of our amendment to the classic Coulomb
model with a speed-dependent local friction. Such behavior accompanies the
transition between states of fully frictional "solid" and those of free
slipping "liquid". In addition, contact counting (the coordination number)
allows us to divide the quaking states into two sub-regimes on the parameter
space, and to characterize the collapse of granular packing at decreasing
densities. These studies generalize our prior laboratory work [Phys. Rev. Lett.
2021, 126 (12), 128001] and suggest new avenues in understanding the buildup of
catastrophic events, such as earthquakes and their precursors.

Diffusion of small particles is omnipresent in a plentiful number of
processes occurring in Nature. As such, it is widely studied and exerted in
almost all branches of sciences. It constitutes such a broad and often rather
complex subject of exploration that we opt here to narrow down our survey for
the case of the diffusion coefficient for a Brownian particle which can be
modeled in the framework of Langevin dynamics. Our main focus will center on
the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient for several fundamental
models of diverse physical systems. Starting out with diffusion in equilibrium
for which the Einstein theory holds we consider a number of physical situations
away from free Brownian motion and end with surveying nonequilibrium diffusion
for a time-periodically driven Brownian particle dwelling randomly in a
periodic potential. For this latter situation the diffusion coefficient
exhibits an intriguingly non-monotonic dependence on temperature.

<br>
<br>
While the pseudogap dominates the phase diagram of hole-doped cuprates,
connecting the antiferromagnetic parent insulator at low doping to the strange
metal at higher doping, its origin and relation to superconductivity remains
unknown. In order to proceed, a complete understanding of how the single hole -
initially localized in the Mott state - becomes mobile and ultimately evolves
into a coherent quasiparticle at the end of the superconducting dome is
required. In order to affect this development, we examine recent transport and
spectroscopic studies of hole-doped cuprates across their phase diagram. In the
process, we highlight a set of empirical correlations between the superfluid
density and certain normal state properties of hole-doped cuprates that offer
fresh insights into the emergence of metallicity within the CuO_2 plane and its
influence on the robustness of the superconducting state. We conclude by
arguing that the overall behavior is best understood in terms of two distinct
current-carrying fluids, only one of which dominates the superconducting
condensate and is gapped out below the pseudogap endpoint at a critical hole
concentration p^\ast.

<br>
Our ability to efficiently detect and generate far-infrared (i.e., terahertz)
radiation is vital in areas spanning from biomedical imaging to interstellar
spectroscopy. Despite decades of intense research, bridging the terahertz gap
between electronics and optics remains a major challenge due to the lack of
robust materials that can efficiently operate in this frequency range, and
two-dimensional (2D) type-II heterostructures may be ideal candidates to fill
this gap. Herein, using highly accurate many-body perturbation theory within
the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, we predict that a type-II
heterostructure consisting of an electron rich C3N and an electron deficient
C3B monolayers can give rise to extraordinary optical activities in the mid- to
far-infrared range. C3N and C3B are two graphene-derived 2D materials that have
attracted increasing research attention. Although both C3N and C3B monolayers
are moderate gap 2D materials, and they only couple through the rather weak van
der Waals interactions, the bilayer heterostructure surprisingly supports
extremely bright, low-energy interlayer excitons with large binding energies of
0.2 ~ 0.4 eV, offering an ideal material with interlayer excitonic states for
mid-to far-infrared applications at room temperature. We also investigate in
detail the properties and formation mechanism of the inter- and intra-layer
excitons.

We propose a protocol to certify the presence of entanglement in artificial
on-surface atomic and molecular spin arrays using electron spin resonance
carried by scanning tunnel microscopes (ESR-STM). We first generalize the
theorem that relates global spin susceptibility as an entanglement witness to
the case of anisotropic Zeeman interactions, relevant for surfaces. We then
propose a method to measure the spin susceptibilities of surface-spin arrays
combining ESR-STM with atomic manipulation. Our calculations show that
entanglement can be certified in antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains with
an odd-number of spins using state of the art spectral resolution of ESR-STM
magnetometry.

<br>
<i>Samuel L. Rudge, Yaling Ke, Michael Thoss</i>
<br>
<br>
A new approach to calculating current-induced forces in charge transport
through nanosystems is introduced. Starting from the fully quantum mechanical
hierarchical equations of motion formalism, a timescale separation between
electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom is used to derive a classical
Langevin equation of motion for the vibrational dynamics as influenced by
current-induced forces, such as the electronic friction. The resulting form of
the friction is shown to be equivalent to previously derived expressions. The
numerical exactness of the hierarchical equations of motion approach, however,
allows the investigation of transport scenarios with strong intrasystem and
system-environment interactions. As a demonstration, the electronic friction of
three example systems is calculated and analyzed: a single electronic level
coupled to one classical vibrational mode, two electronic levels coupled to one
classical vibrational mode, and a single electronic level coupled to both a
classical and quantum vibrational mode.

We propose a data-driven approach based on information about structural
fluctuations of polymer chains, which clearly identifies the glass transition
temperature $T_g$ of polymer melts of weakly semiflexible chains. We use
principal component analysis (PCA) with clustering to distinguish between
liquid and glassy states and predict $T_g$ in the asymptotic limit. Our method
indicates that for temperatures approaching $T_g$ from above it is sufficient
to consider short molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, which just reach
into the Rouse-like monomer displacement regime. The first eigenvalue of PCA
and participation ratio show sharp changes around $T_g$. Our approach requires
minimum user inputs and is robust and transferable.

cell density, and is a constant as the density is increased further. The
increase in the viscosity as a function of the cell area fraction ({\phi})
follows the behavior familiar in glass forming systems but the saturation at
high {\phi} is a surprise, especially in a living system. To determine the
mechanism of this unexpected behavior of viscosity, we perform extensive
simulations using an agent-based model of a dense non-confluent two-dimensional
tissue. We show that polydispersity in the cell size, and the propensity of the
cells to deform, results in the available free area per cell to saturate beyond
a critical density. Saturation in the free space not only explains the
viscosity plateau but also links equilibrium geometrical packing to dramatic
increase in the relaxation dynamics.

Theory of the Linear photogalvanic effect is developed for direct optical
transitions between surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators.
The photocurrent governed by the orientation of the polarization plane of light
and caused by the warping of the energy dispersion of two-dimensional carriers
is calculated. It is shown that both the shift contribution caused by
coordinate shifts of the particle wavepackets during the optical transitions
and the ballistic contribution caused by interference of the optical absorption
and scattering by disorder have generally the same order of magnitude. The
ballistic contribution is present owing to electron-hole asymmetry of
topological surface states and has a frequency dependence in contrast to the
shift photocurrent. In the nonlinear in the light intensity regime appearing
due to saturation of the direct optical transitions the ballistic contribution
dominates. The nontrivial dependence of the photocurrent on the polarization
plane orientation in the nonlinear regime appears solely due to the ballistic
contribution. Our findings allow separating the ballistic and shift
contributions to the Linear photogalvanic current in experiments.

Short-time dynamics of many-body systems may exhibit non-analytical behavior
of the systems' properties at particular times, thus dubbed dynamical quantum
phase transition. Simulations showed that in the presence of disorder new
critical times appear in the quench evolution of the Ising model. We study the
physics behind these new critical times. We discuss the spectral features of
the Ising model responsible for the disorder-induced phase transitions. We
found the critical value of the disorder sufficient to induce the dynamical
phase transition as a function of the number of spins. Most importantly, we
argue that this dynamical phase transition while non-topological lacks a local
order parameter.

Superconducting diodes are a recently-discovered quantum analogueue of
classical diodes. The superconducting diode effect relies on the breaking of
both time-reversal and inversion symmetry. As a result, the critical current of
a superconductor can become dependent on the direction of the applied current.
The combination of these ingredients naturally occurs in proximitized
semiconductors under a magnetic field, which is also predicted to give rise to
exotic physics such as topological superconductivity. In this work, we use InSb
nanowires proximitized by Al to investigate the superconducting diode effect.
Through shadow-wall lithography, we create short Josephson junctions with gate
control of both the semiconducting weak link as well as the proximitized leads.
When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the nanowire axis, the
superconducting diode effect depends on the out-of-plane angle. In particular,
it is strongest along a specific angle, which we interpret as the direction of
the spin-orbit field in the proximitized leads. Moreover, the electrostatic
gates can be used to drastically alter this effect and even completely suppress
it. Finally, we also observe a significant gate-tunable diode effect when the
magnetic field is applied parallel to the nanowire axis. Due to the
considerable degree of control via electrostatic gating, the
semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson diode emerges as a promising
element for innovative superconducting circuits and computation devices.

We introduce a general mechanism for obtaining Weyl points in a stack of 2D
quasicrystals, which can be extended to any stack of aperiodic layers. To do
so, we drive a topological phase transition with the vertical crystal-momentum
as the tuning parameter, which leads to gap closures at the critical points. We
illustrate this in a simple 3D generalization of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model defined
on a Penrose quasicrystal. We establish the presence of Weyl points via the
local Chern marker, projected band structure and density of states.
Interestingly, we also uncover an analogue of Fermi arcs in the
quasicrystalline setting, which we deem Fermi-Bragg arcs, densely distributed
lines connecting the band degeneracies at the same Fourier momenta as the Bragg
peaks. We also discuss connections to the recently observed band crossings in a
stack of chalcogenide quasicrystals and the prospect of a fully
quasicrystalline Weyl system. The flexibility of our proposal opens the way for
the realization of other gapless topological phases in aperiodic platforms,
thereby significantly expanding the scope of topological band theory.
