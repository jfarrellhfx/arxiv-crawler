<h3>Hydrodynamics of Multicomponent Vesicles Under Strong Confinement</h3>

We numerically investigate the hydrodynamics and membrane dynamics of
multicomponent vesicles in two strongly confined geometries. This serves as a
simplified model for red blood cells undergoing large deformations while
traversing narrow constrictions. We propose a new parameterization for the
bending modulus that remains positive for all lipid phase parameter values. For
a multicomponent vesicle passing through a stenosis, we establish connections
between various properties: lipid phase coarsening, size and flow profile of
the lubrication layers, excess pressure, and the tank-treading velocity of the
membrane. For a multicomponent vesicle passing through a contracting channel,
we find that the lipid always phase separates so that the vesicle is stiffer in
the front as it passes through the constriction. For both cases of confinement,
we find that lipid coarsening is arrested under strong confinement and proceeds
at a high rate upon relief from extreme confinement. The results may be useful
for efficient sorting lipid domains using microfluidic flows by controlled
release of vesicles passing through strong confinement

Hydrodynamics provides a successful framework to effectively describe the
dynamics of complex many-body systems ranging from subnuclear to cosmological
scales by introducing macroscopic quantities such as particle densities and
fluid velocities. According to textbook knowledge, it requires coarse graining
over microscopic constituents to define a macroscopic fluid cell, which is
large compared to the interparticle spacing and the mean free path. In
addition, the entire system must consist of many such fluid cells. The latter
requirement on the system size has been challenged by experiments on
high-energy heavy-ion collisions, where collective particle emission, typically
associated with the formation of a hydrodynamic medium, has been observed with
few tens of final-state particles. Here, we demonstrate emergence of
hydrodynamics in a system with significantly less constituents. Our observation
challenges the requirements for a hydrodynamic description, as in our system
all relevant length scales, i.e. the system size, the inter-particle spacing,
and the mean free path are comparable. The single particle resolution,
deterministic control over particle number and interaction strength in our
experiment allow us to explore the boundaries between a microscopic description
and a hydrodynamic framework in unprecedented detail.

<h3>Gas in external fields: the weird case of the logarithmic trap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08568" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08568</a>
<br>
<i>Loris Ferrari</i>
<br>
<br>
The effects of an attractive logarithmic potential $u_0\ln(r/r_0)$ on a gas
of $N$ non interacting particles (Bosons or Fermions), in a box of volume
$V_D$, are studied in $D=2,3$ dimensions. The unconventional behavior of the
gas challenges the current notions of thermodynamic limit and size
independence. When $V_D$ and $N$ diverge, with finite density $N/V_D<\infty$
and finite trap strength $u_0>0$, the gas collapses in the ground state,
independently from the bosonic/fermionic nature of the particles, at \emph{any}
temperature. If, instead, $N/V_D\rightarrow0$, there exists a critical
temperature $T_c$, such that the gas remains in the ground state at any
$T<T_c$, and "evaporates" above, in a non-equilibrium state of borderless
diffusion. For the gas to exhibit a conventional Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) or a finite Fermi level, the strength $u_0$ must vanish with
$V_D\rightarrow\infty$, according to a complicated exponential relationship, as
a consequence of the exponentially increasing density of states, specific of
the logarithmic trap.

<h3>Improving the Cramér-Rao bound with the detailed fluctuation theorem</h3>

<br>
<br>
In some non-equilibrium systems, the distribution of entropy production
$p(\Sigma)$ satisfies the detailed fluctuation theorem (DFT),
$p(\Sigma)/p(-\Sigma)=\exp(\Sigma)$. When the distribution $p(\Sigma)$ shows
time-dependency, the celebrated Cram\'{e}r-Rao (CR) bound asserts that the mean
entropy production rate is upper bounded in terms of the variance of $\Sigma$
and the Fisher information with respect to time. In this letter, we employ the
DFT to derive an upper bound for the mean entropy production rate that improves
the CR bound. We show that this new bound serves as an accurate approximation
for the entropy production rate in the heat exchange problem mediated by a
weakly coupled bosonic mode. The bound is saturated for the same setup when
mediated by a weakly coupled qubit.

<h3>Asymmetric discrete random walk and drift-diffusion with unequal jump  times, lengths, and probabilities</h3>

Random walk has wide applications in many fields, such as machine learning,
biology, physics, and chemistry. Random walk can be discrete or continuous in
time and space. Asymmetric random walk could be described by drift-diffusion
equation. The discrete asymmetric random walk provides a basis for
understanding biased drift-diffusion. However, the current reported theoretical
results for discrete random walks do not give a general theoretical treatment
for the asymmetry due to unequal jump times. In this paper, the theoretical
expressions for asymmetric random walks with unequal jump probabilities, times,
and lengths are derived. The obtained theoretical results can be reduced to
reported results when jump times are equal. Additionally, discrete random walk
simulations are performed to verify the obtained theoretical results. There are
good agreements between the theoretical predictions and simulation results.

<h3>First-principles determination of the phonon-point defect scattering and  thermal transport due to fission products in ThO2</h3>

<br>
<br>
This work presents the first principles calculations of the lattice thermal
conductivity degradation due to point defects in thorium dioxide using an
alternative solution of the Pierels-Boltzmann transport equation. We have used
the non-perturbative Green's function methodology to compute the phonon point
defect scattering rates that consider the local distortion around the point
defect, including the mass difference changes, interatomic force constants and
structural relaxation near the point defects. The point defects considered in
the work include the vacancy of thorium and oxygen, substitution of helium,
krypton, zirconium, iodine, xenon, in the thorium site, and the three different
configuration of the Schottky defects. The results of the phonon-defect
scattering rate reveals that among the considered intrinsic defects, the
thorium vacancy and helium substitution in the thorium site scatter the phonon
most due to substantial changes in the force constant and structural
distortions. The scattering of phonons due to the substitutional defects
unveils that the zirconium atom scatters phonons the least, followed by xenon,
iodine, krypton, and helium. This is contrary to the intuition that the
scattering strength follows HeTh > KrTh > ZrTh > ITh > XeTh based on the mass
difference. This striking difference in the zirconium phonon scattering is due
to the local chemical environment changes. Zirconium is an electropositive
element with valency similar to thorium and, therefore, can bond with the
oxygen atoms, thus creating less force constant variance compared to iodine, an
electronegative element, noble gas helium, xenon, and krypton. These results
can serve as the benchmark for the analytical models and help the
engineering-scale modeling effort for nuclear design.

Cavity materials are a frontier to investigate the role of light-matter
interactions on the properties of electronic phases of matter. In this work, we
raise a fundamental question: can non-local interactions mediated by cavity
photons destabilize a topological electronic phase? We investigate this
question by characterizing entanglement, energy spectrum and correlation
functions of the topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain interacting with
an optical cavity mode. Employing density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
and exact diagonalization (ED), we demonstrate the stability of the edge state
and establish an area law scaling for the ground state entanglement entropy,
despite long-range correlations induced by light-matter interactions. These
features are linked to gauge invariance and the scaling of virtual photon
excitations entangled with matter, effectively computed in a low-dimensional
Krylov subspace of the full Hilbert space. This work provides a framework for
characterizing novel equilibrium phenomena in topological cavity materials.

<h3>Understanding Symmetry Breaking in Twisted Bilayer Graphene from Cluster  Constraints</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08590" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08590</a>

Twisted bilayer graphene is an exciting platform for exploring correlated
quantum phases, extremely tunable with respect to both the single-particle
bands and the interaction profile of electrons. Here, we investigate the phase
diagram of twisted bilayer graphene as described by an extended Hubbard model
on the honeycomb lattice with two fermionic orbitals (valleys) per site.
Besides the special extended {\it cluster interaction} $Q$, we incorporate the
effect of gating through an onsite Hubbard-interaction $U$. Within Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC), we find valence-bond-solid, N\'eel-valley antiferromagnetic
or charge-density wave phases. Further, we elucidate the competition of these
phases by noticing that the cluster interaction induces an exotic constraint on
the Hilbert space, which we dub {\it the cluster rule}, in analogy to the
famous pyrochlore spin-ice rule. Formulating the perturbative Hamiltonian by
projecting into the cluster-rule manifold, we perform exact diagonalization and
construct the fixed-point states of the observed phases. Finally, we compute
the local electron density patterns as signatures distinguishing these phases,
which could be observed with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our work
capitalizes on the notion of cluster constraints in the extended Hubbard model
of twisted bilayer graphene, and suggests a scheme towards realization of
several symmetry-breaking insulating phases in a twisted-bilayer graphene
sheet.

<h3>Confinement in 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theories at Finite  Temperature</h3>

<br>
<br>
Confinement is a paradigmatic phenomenon of gauge theories, and its
understanding lies at the forefront of high-energy physics. Here, we study
confinement in a simple one-dimensional \Zt lattice gauge theory at finite
temperature and filling, which is within the reach of current cold-atom and
superconducting-qubit platforms. By employing matrix product states (MPS)
calculations, we investigate the decay of the finite-temperature Green's
function and uncover a smooth crossover between the confined and deconfined
regimes. This is furthermore confirmed by considering the Friedel oscillations
and string length distributions obtained from snapshots sampled from MPS, both
of which are experimentally readily available. Finally, we verify that confined
mesons remain well-defined at finite temperature by probing their quench
dynamics with exact diagonalization. Our results shed new light on confinement
at finite temperature from an experimentally relevant standpoint.

<h3>Automatic Order Detection and Restoration Through Systematically  Improvable Variational Wave Functions</h3>

<br>

Variational wave function ansatze are an invaluable tool to study the
properties of strongly correlated systems. We propose such a wave function,
based on the theory of auxiliary fields and combining aspects of
auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo and modern variational optimization
techniques including automatic differentiation. The resulting ansatz,
consisting of several slices of optimized projectors, is highly expressive and
systematically improvable. We benchmark this form on the two-dimensional
Hubbard model, using both cylindrical and large, fully periodic supercells. The
computed ground-state energies are competitive with the best variational
results. Moreover, the optimized wave functions predict the correct
ground-state order with near full symmetry restoration (i.e. translation
invariance) despite initial states with incorrect orders. The ansatz can become
a tool for local order prediction, leading to a new paradigm for variational
studies of bulk systems. It can also be viewed as an approach to produce
accurate and systematically improvable wave functions in a convenient form of
non-orthogonal Slater determinants (e.g., for quantum chemistry) at polynomial
computational cost.

<h3>Universal Fluctuations of Local Measurement in Low-Dimensional Systems</h3>

Probes perform local measurements by interacting with the surrounding system.
This often occurs in a dilute system whose effective macroscopic dynamics are
diffusive. It is analytically shown here that, for dimensions two or less, the
relative uncertainty of any such measurement converges to an explicit universal
power law in the long-time limit. The dynamical exponent depends on the
dimension, and the prefactor depends solely on the bulk density and the
effective mass diffusivity. Simulations of four distinct microscopic models
support the results. The results imply that saturation of thermodynamic
uncertainty relations cannot be approached for local measurements.

<h3>Anomalous shift and optical vorticity in the steady photovoltaic current</h3>

<br>
<br>
Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk
photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements
(`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The
shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received
the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far
outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the
shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This
outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband
Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they
scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the
interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic
current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the
light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order
$mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap,
or joint density of states.

<h3>Two-dimensional altermagnets: A minimal microscopic model</h3>

<br>
<i>Bjørnulf Brekke, Arne Brataas, Asle Sudbø</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a minimal toy model for a two-dimensional altermagnet. The model
unravels altermagnetic properties at a microscopic level. We find spin-split
electron- and non-degenerate magnon bands with a $d$-wave symmetry. We use the
model to explore magnon-mediated superconductivity in altermagnets. The
dominant superconducting state is spin-polarized with a $p$-wave symmetry. The
state adopts its characteristics from the spin-split electron bands.
Furthermore, we find that the superconducting critical temperature of
altermagnets can be significantly enhanced by tuning the chemical potential.

<h3>Pair density wave superconductivity: a microscopic model in two  dimensions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductivity is a long-sought exotic state with
oscillating superconducting order parameter without the need of applying
external magnetic field. So far it has been rare in establishing a
two-dimensional (2D) microscopic model with such exotic long-range order in its
ground state. Here we propose to study PDW superconductivity in a minimal model
of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with nearest-neighbor (NN) and
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $V_1$ and $V_2$, respectively. By
performing a state-of-the-art density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study
of this $t$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model at finite doping on six-leg and eight-leg
honeycomb cylinders, we showed that the ground state exhibits PDW ordering
(namely quasi-long-range order with a divergent PDW susceptibility). Remarkably
this PDW state persists on the wider cylinder with 2D-like Fermi surfaces (FS).
To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical
evidence of PDW in systems with 2D-like FS.

<h3>Influence of magnetism, strain and pressure on the band topology of  EuCd$_2$As$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the wealth of proposals and realizations of nontrivial
topological phases in EuCd$_2$As$_2$, such as a Weyl semimetallic state and the
recently discussed semimetallic versus semiconductor behavior in this system,
we analyze in this work the role of the delicate interplay of Eu magnetism,
strain and pressure on the realization of such phases. For that we invoke a
combination of a group theoretical analysis with ab initio density functional
theory calculations and uncover a rich phase diagram with various non-trivial
topological phases beyond a Weyl semimetallic state, such as axion and
topological crystalline insulating phases, and discuss their realization.

<h3>Local probe investigation of the spin dynamics in the kagome and  inter-layers of orthorhombic barlowite Cu$_4$(OD)$_6$FBr: $^{79}$Br and  $^{63}$Cu NQR study</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report $^{79}$Br and $^{63}$Cu nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) in the
paramagnetic state above $T_\text{N} = 15$ K of the antiferromagnetic
orthorhombic phase of barlowite Cu$_4$(OD)$_6$FBr consisting of a layered
kagome structure. The divergent behavior of the longitudinal $^{79}(1/T_{1})$
and transverse $^{79}(1/T_{2})$ relaxation rates observed at $^{79}$Br sites
evidences that critical slowing down of Cu spin fluctuations sets in below
$\sim20$ K. This means that one or more Cu sites, most likely at the interlayer
Cu(3,4,5) sites between the kagome planes, undergo the antiferromagnetic phase
transition in a fairly conventional way. On the other hand, the $^{63}$Cu NQR
signal intensity is gradually wiped out below $\sim30$ K, pointing toward
gradual spin freezing of the kagome layers instead. These contrasting findings
suggest significant roles played by magnetic frustration effects within the
kagome layers.

<h3>Phase separation and phase transitions in undoped and Rh3+ doped iron  pnictide CaFe2As2: a Raman scattering study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08633</a>
<br>
<i>V. P. Gnezdilov, A. Yu. Glamazda, P. Lemmens, K. Kudo, M. Nohara</i>
<br>
<br>
Iron-pnictides Ca(Fe1-xRhx)2As2 (x = 0, 0.035, and 0.19) were studied across
the tetragonal-orthorhombic and uncollapsed to collapsed tetragonal phase
transitions using Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the phase separation was
observed in the high-temperature phase for the first time. Two phases with the
low-spin and high-spin states of the Fe2+ ions coexist in the undoped (x = 0)
and doped (x = 0.035) samples at ambient conditions. These two phases are
present on a larger length scale and they are not limited to the local
distortions. Both phases in the undoped sample successfully undergo
tetra-to-ortho phase transitions approximately at the same temperature T0 = 160
K. In doped samples, a cascade of phase transitions is observed at temperatures
T* = 100 K and Tc = 72 K with cooling for the first time. A complex type of the
re-entrant magnetic structure is realized in the x = 0.035 sample at
temperatures below Tc, which is distinct from the usual orthorhombic twofold
one. The overdoped sample (x = 0.19) also shows phase separation at
temperatures 7 - 295 K in Raman spectra similar to these of the remnant phase.

<h3>Polarized and narrow excitonic emission from graphene-capped monolayer  WS$_2$ through resonant phonon relaxation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08637" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08637</a>
<br>
<i>Garima Gupta, Kausik Majumdar</i>
<br>
<br>
The broadening and polarization of excitonic luminescence in monolayer TMDs
largely suffer from inhomogeneity and temperature - an unresolved problem to
date. In this work, through few-layer-graphene encapsulation of monolayer
WS$_2$, we reduce the inter-excitonic energy separation, which then can have a
narrow resonance with a specific phonon mode of our choice. The resulting
single-step exciton relaxation with the resonating phonon mode significantly
suppresses the inhomogeneous broadening, allowing us to achieve the narrowest
exciton linewidth of 1.06 meV (which translates to 0.19 meV after deconvolution
with the excitation laser linewidth). The single-phonon resonance helps to
achieve a high quantum efficiency despite graphene encapsulation. The technique
is powerful in tuning the exciton polarization during relaxation by choosing a
specific resonating phonon mode. For example, the valley coherence
(polarization) improves from $\sim$68% ($\sim$40%) to $\sim$90% ($\sim$75%) on
resonance with 2$A_1$' and $A_1$' modes respectively. We further demonstrate a
strong polarization reversal on resonance with a chiral phonon mode.
Strikingly, the above features remain robust against temperature (up to 200 K)
and sample age (few months in ambient condition). The findings will lead to
clean excitonic measurements without requiring cryogenic cooling.

<h3>Maximally mixing active nematics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Active nematics are an important new paradigm in soft condensed matter
systems. They consist of rod-like components with an internal driving force
pushing them out of equilibrium. The resulting fluid motion exhibits chaotic
advection, in which a small patch of fluid is stretched exponentially in
length. Using simulation, this Letter shows that this system can exhibit stable
periodic motion when sufficiently confined to a square with periodic boundary
conditions. Moreover, employing tools from braid theory, we show that this
motion is maximally mixing, in that it optimizes the (dimensionless)
``topological entropy'' -- the exponential stretching rate of a material line
advected by the fluid. That is, this periodic motion of the defects,
counterintuitively, produces more chaotic mixing than chaotic motion of the
defects. We also explore the stability of the periodic state. Importantly, we
show how to stabilize this orbit into a larger periodic tiling, a critical
necessity for it to be seen in future experiments.

<h3>Robust superconductivity and the suppression of charge-density wave in  $\text{Ca}_{3}(\text{Ir}_{1-x}\text{Rh}_{x})_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$ single  crystals at ambient pressure</h3>

Single crystals of Ca$_3$(Ir$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_4$Sn$_{13}$ (3-4-13) were
synthesized by flux growth and characterized by X-ray diffraction, EDX,
magnetization, resistivity and radio frequency magnetic susceptibility tunnel
diode resonator (TDR) techniques. Compositional variation of the Rh/Ir ratio
was used to study the coexistence and competition between the charge density
wave (CDW) and superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature
varies from approximately 7 K in pure Ir ($x=0$) to approximately 8.3 K in pure
Rh ($x=1$). Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity reveals monotonic
suppression of the CDW transition temperature, $T_{\text{CDW}}(x)$. The CDW
starts in pure Ir, $x=0$, with $T_{\text{CDW}}\approx40$~K and extrapolates
roughly linearly to zero at $x_c=0.58$ under the dome of superconductivity.
Magnetization and transport measurements show a significant influence of CDW on
the superconducting and normal state. Vortex pinning is substantially enhanced
in the CDW region, and the resistivity is larger in this part of the phase
diagram. The London penetration depth is attenuated exponentially upon cooling
at low temperatures for all compositions, indicating a fully-gapped Fermi
surface. We conclude that a novel
$\text{Ca}_3(\text{Ir}_{1-x}\text{Rh}_x)_4\text{Sn}_{13}$ alloy with
coexisting/competing CDW and superconductivity, is a good candidate to look for
a composition-driven quantum critical point at ambient pressure.

In this work we examine synthetic antiferromagnetic structures consisting of
two, three, and four antiferromagnetic coupled layers, i.e., bilayers,
trilayers, and tetralayers. We vary the thickness of the ferromagnetic layers
across all structures and, using a macrospin formalism, find that the nearest
neighbor exchange interaction between layers is consistent across all
structures for a given thickness. Our model and experimental results
demonstrate significant differences in how the magnetostatic equilibrium states
of even and odd-layered structures evolve as a function of the external field.
Even layered structures continuously evolve from a collinear antiferromagnetic
state to a spin canted non-collinear magnetic configuration that is
mirror-symmetric about the external field. In contrast, odd-layered structures
begin with a ferrimagnetic ground state; at a critical field, the ferrimagnetic
ground state evolves into a non-collinear state with broken symmetry.
Specifically, the magnetic moments found in the odd-layered samples possess
stable static equilibrium states that are no longer mirror-symmetric about the
external field after a critical field is reached. Our results reveal the rich
behavior of synthetic antiferromagnets.

Local dissipation of RF power in superconducting radio frequency cavities
create so called hot spots, primary precursors of cavity quench driven by
either thermal or magnetic instability. These hot spots are detected by a
temperature mapping system, and a large increase in temperature on the outer
surface is detected during cavity quench events. Here, we have used combined
magnetic and temperature mapping systems using anisotropic magnetoresistance
(AMR) sensors and carbon resisters to locate the hot spots and areas with high
trapped flux on a 3.0 GHz single-cell Nb cavity during the RF tests at 2.0 K.
The quench location and hot spots were detected near the equator when the
residual magnetic field in the Dewar is kept < 1 mG. The hot spots and quench
locations moved when the magnetic field is trapped locally, as detected by
T-mapping system. No significant dynamics of trapped flux is detected by AMR
sensors, however, change in magnetic flux during cavity quench is detected by a
flux gate magnetometer, close to the quench location. The result provides the
direct evidence of hot spots and quench events due to localized trapped
vortices.

Synthesis of thin films has traditionally relied upon slow, sequential
processes carried out with substantial human intervention, frequently utilizing
a mix of experience and serendipity to optimize material structure and
properties. With recent advances in autonomous systems which combine synthesis,
characterization, and decision making with artificial intelligence (AI), large
parameter spaces can be explored autonomously at rates beyond what is possible
by human experimentalists, greatly accelerating discovery, optimization, and
understanding in materials synthesis which directly address the grand
challenges in synthesis science. Here, we demonstrate autonomous synthesis of a
contemporary 2D material by combining the highly versatile pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) technique with automation and machine learning (ML). We
incorporated in situ and real-time spectroscopy, a high-throughput methodology,
and cloud connectivity to enable autonomous synthesis workflows with PLD.
Ultrathin WSe2 films were grown using co-ablation of two targets and showed a
10x increase in throughput over traditional PLD workflows. Gaussian process
regression and Bayesian optimization were used with in situ Raman spectroscopy
to autonomously discover two distinct growth windows and the process-property
relationship after sampling only 0.25% of a large 4D parameter space. Any
material that can be grown with PLD could be autonomously synthesized with our
platform and workflows, enabling accelerated discovery and optimization of a
vast number of materials.

Nanoscale quantum dots in microwave cavities can be used as a laboratory for
exploring electron-electron interactions and their spin in the presence of
quantized light and a magnetic field. We show how a simple theoretical model of
this interplay at resonance predicts complex but measurable effects. New
polariton states emerge that combine spin, relative modes, and radiation. These
states have intricate spin-space correlations and undergo polariton transitions
controlled by the microwave cavity field. We uncover novel topological effects
involving highly correlated spin and charge density, that display
singlet-triplet and inhomogeneous Bell-state distributions. Signatures of these
transitions are imprinted in the photon distribution, which will allow for
optical read out protocols in future experiments and nanoscale quantum
technologies.

Electronic nematicity, a state in which rotational symmetry is spontaneously
broken, has become a familiar characteristic of many strongly correlated
materials. One widely studied example is the discovered Ising-nematicity and
its interplay with superconductivity in tetragonal iron pnictides. Since
nematic directors in crystalline solids are restricted by the underlying
crystal symmetry, recently identified quantum material systems with three-fold
rotational (C3) symmetry offer a new platform to investigate nematic order with
three-state Potts character. Here, we report reversible strain tuning of the
three-state Potts nematicity in a zigzag antiferromagnetic insulator, FePSe3.
Probing the nematicity via optical linear dichroism, we demonstrate either
2{\pi}/3 or {\pi}/2 rotation of nematic director by uniaxial strain. The nature
of the nematic phase transition can also be controlled such that it undergoes a
smooth crossover transition, a Potts nematic transition, or a Ising nematic
flop transition. The ability to tune the nematic order with in-situ strain
further enables the extraction of nematic susceptibility, which exhibits a
divergent behavior near the magnetic ordering temperature. Our work points to
an active control approach to manipulate and explore nematicity in three-state
Potts correlated materials.

<h3>Is the glassy dynamics same in 2D as in 3D? The Adam Gibbs relation test</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08743</a>

<br>
<br>
It has been recognized of late that even amorphous, glass-forming materials
in two dimensions (2D) are significantly affected by Mermin-Wagner type long
wavelength thermal fluctuation which is inconsequential in three (3D) and
higher dimensions. Thus any study of glassy dynamics in 2D should first remove
the effect of such fluctuations. The present work considers the question of
whether the role of spatial dimension on glassy dynamics is only limited to
such fluctuations, or whether the nature of glassy dynamics is intrinsically
different in 2D. We address this issue by studying the relationship between
dynamics and thermodynamics within the framework of the Adam-Gibbs (AG)
relation and its generalization the Random First Order Transition (RFOT)
theory. Using two model glass-forming liquids we find that even after removing
the effect of long wavelength fluctuations, the AG relation breaks down in two
dimensions. Then we consider the effect of anharmonicity of vibrational entropy
- a second factor highlighted recently that can qualitatively change the nature
of dynamics. We explicitly compute the configurational entropy both with and
without the anharmonic correction. We show that the anharmonic correction
reduces the extent of deviation from the AG relation, but even after taking
into account its effects, the AG relation still breaks down in 2D. It is also
more prominent if one considers diffusion coefficient rather than
$\alpha$-relaxation time. Overall, the impact of the anharmonicity of vibration
is larger than the long wavelength fluctuation in determining the qualitative
relation between timescales and entropy. The extent and nature of deviation
from the AG relation crucially depends on the attractive vs. repulsive nature
of the inter-particle interaction. Thus our results suggest that the glassy
dynamics in 2D may be intrinsically different from that in 3D.

<h3>Continuum model of strong light-matter coupling for molecular polaritons</h3>

Strong coupling between light and matter generates hybrid polaritons. We
present a continuum model that describes the polaritons by light and matter
densities of states (DOS) that only depend on the refractive index of the
material. This model is applied to molecular polaritons derived from molecules
with broad spectral absorption. While the photonic DOS has a complex spectral
distribution, the matter DOS is largely unmodified by strong coupling. We argue
that bright states cannot be partitioned from dark states, and instead the
photonic DOS is shared over a vast number of matter states.

The ideal kagome lattice shows an electronic structure with intriguing
correlated and topological electronic states. In realistic materials, however,
the kagome atomic layer is generally buried inside a bulk while little is known
about the kagome layer on a surface. In this work, we reveal that the kagome
layer of the recently discovered kagome metals $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$ = Y and
rare-earth elements) exhibits strong lattice instabilities when exposed on the
surface, despite that it is stable inside the bulk. Exemplified by
TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ without bulk charge density waves, surface kagome layers present
$\sqrt 3 \times \sqrt 3$ and $2 \times 2$ surface charge orders (SCOs). In
contrast, SCOs disappear when kagome surfaces are covered by a Sn or TbSn
atomic layer. These SCOs exhibit clover-like patterns with trimers of V atoms,
different from known bulk CDWs. Furthermore, we find that SCOs are generally
present (absent) in thin films of $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ terminated with kagome
(non-kagome) sublattices, indicating its surface origin. The SCOs distort the
kagome lattice and sensitively modify kagome surface bands. Our work reveals
unexpected surface instability of kagome materials and calls for
surface-sensitive measurements such as scanning tunneling microscopy.

In a stack of atomically-thin Van der Waals layers, introducing interlayer
twist creates a moir\'e superlattice whose period is a function of twist angle.
Changes in that twist angle of even hundredths of a degree can dramatically
transform the system's electronic properties. Setting a precise and uniform
twist angle for a stack remains difficult, hence determining that twist angle
and mapping its spatial variation is very important. Techniques have emerged to
do this by imaging the moir\'e, but most of these require sophisticated
infrastructure, time-consuming sample preparation beyond stack synthesis, or
both. In this work, we show that Torsional Force Microscopy (TFM), a scanning
probe technique sensitive to dynamic friction, can reveal surface and shallow
subsurface structure of Van der Waals stacks on multiple length scales: the
moir\'es formed between bilayers of graphene and between graphene and hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN), and also the atomic crystal lattices of graphene and hBN.
In TFM, torsional motion of an AFM cantilever is monitored as the it is
actively driven at a torsional resonance while a feedback loop maintains
contact at a set force with the surface of a sample. TFM works at room
temperature in air, with no need for an electrical bias between the tip and the
sample, making it applicable to a wide array of samples. It should enable
determination of precise structural information including twist angles and
strain in moir\'e superlattices and crystallographic orientation of VdW flakes
to support predictable moir\'e heterostructure fabrication.

In many physical or biological systems, diffusion can be described by
Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). Recently,
specific models of the motions have been proposed for anomalous diffusion. In
the present study, we investigate properties of the diffusion with a broad
class of stochastic DCs using the Fokker-Planck formalism. We show that for a
finite time, the propagator is non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed. This means that
when the mean square displacements are the same, for a finite time, some of the
diffusing particles with stochastic DCs diffuse farther than the particles with
deterministic DCs or exhibiting a fractional Brownian motion.

Ferroic orders describe spontaneous polarization of spin, charge, and lattice
degrees of freedom in materials. Materials featuring multiple ferroic orders,
known as multiferroics, play important roles in multi-functional electrical and
magnetic device applications. 2D materials with honeycomb lattices offer
exciting opportunities to engineer unconventional multiferroicity, where the
ferroic orders are driven purely by the orbital degrees of freedom but not
electron spin. These include ferro-valleytricity corresponding to the electron
valley and ferro-orbital-magnetism supported by quantum geometric effects. Such
orbital multiferroics could offer strong valley-magnetic couplings and large
responses to external fields-enabling device applications such as
multiple-state memory elements, and electric control of valley and magnetic
states. Here we report orbital multiferroicity in pentalayer rhombohedral
graphene using low temperature magneto-transport measurements. We observed
anomalous Hall signals Rxy with an exceptionally large Hall angle (tan{\Theta}H
> 0.6) and orbital magnetic hysteresis at hole doping. There are four such
states with different valley polarizations and orbital magnetizations, forming
a valley-magnetic quartet. By sweeping the gate electric field E we observed a
butterfly-shaped hysteresis of Rxy connecting the quartet. This hysteresis
indicates a ferro-valleytronic order that couples to the composite field E\cdot
B, but not the individual fields. Tuning E would switch each ferroic order
independently, and achieve non-volatile switching of them together. Our
observations demonstrate a new type of multiferroics and point to electrically
tunable ultra-low power valleytronic and magnetic devices.

We investigated the effect of Fe segregated from partially Fe-substituted MgO
(MgFeO) on the magnetic properties of CoFeB/MgFeO multilayers. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as magnetic measurements revealed that
the segregated Fe was reduced to metal and exhibited ferromagnetism at the
CoFeB/MgFeO interface. The CoFeB/MgFeO multilayer showed more than 2-fold
enhancement in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) energy density compared
with a standard CoFeB/MgO multilayer. The PMA energy density was further
enhanced by inserting an ultrathin MgO layer in between CoFeB and MgFeO layers.
Ferromagnetic resonance measurement also revealed a remarkable reduction of
magnetic damping in the CoFeB/MgFeO multilayers.

The electron transport in current-biased superconducting nano-bridges is
determined by the motion of the quantum vortex confined in the internal
disorder landscape. Here we consider a simple case of a single or two
neighbouring linear defects crossing a nano-bridge. The strong anharmonicity of
the vortex motion along the defect leads, upon RF-excitation, to fractional
Shapiro steps. In the case of two defects, the vortex motion becomes
correlated, characterized by metastable states that can be locked to a resonant
RF-drive. The lock-unlock process causes sudden voltage jumps and drops in the
voltage-current characteristics observed in experiments. We analyze the
parameters promoting these metastable dynamic states and discuss their
potential applications in quantum devices.

Calculating the electronic structure of materials at finite temperatures is
important for rationalizing their physical properties and assessing their
technological capabilities. However, finite-temperature calculations typically
require large system sizes or long simulation times. This is challenging for
non-empirical theoretical methods because the involved bottleneck of performing
many first-principles calculations can pose a steep computational barrier for
larger systems. While machine-learning molecular dynamics enables
large-scale/long-time simulations of the structural properties, the difficulty
of computing in particular the electronic structure of large and disordered
materials still remains. In this work, we suggest an adaptation of the
tight-binding formalism which allows for computationally efficient calculations
of temperature-dependent properties of semiconductors. Our dynamic
tight-binding approach utilizes hybrid-orbital basis functions and a modeling
of the distance dependence of matrix elements via numerical integration of
atomic orbitals. We show that these design choices lead to a dynamic
tight-binding model with a minimal amount of parameters which are
straightforwardly optimized using density functional theory. Combining dynamic
tight-binding with machine learning molecular dynamics and hybrid density
functional theory, we find that it accurately describes finite-temperature
electronic properties in comparison to experiment for the prototypical
semiconductor gallium-arsenide.

<h3>On the role of selective nucleation and growth to recrystallization  texture development in a Mg-Gd-Zn alloy</h3>

One of the main material properties altered by rare earth additions in
magnesium alloys is texture, which can be specifically adjusted to enhance
ductility and formability. The current study aims at illuminating the texture
selection process in a Mg-0.073at%Gd-0.165at%Zn alloy by investigating
recrystallization nucleation and early nucleus growth during static
recrystallization. An as-cast sample of the investigated alloy was deformed in
uniaxial compression at 200{\deg}C till 40% strain and was then cut into two
halves for subsequent microstructure characterization via ex-situ and quasi
in-situ EBSD investigations. In order to gain insights into the evolution of
texture during recrystallization, the contributions from dynamic and static
recrystallization were initially separated and the origin of the non-basal
orientation of recrystallization nuclei was traced back to several potential
nucleation sites within the deformed matrix. Considering the significant role
of double-twin band recrystallization in determining the recrystallization
texture, this type of recrystallization nucleation was further investigated via
quasi-in-situ EBSD on a deformed sample, annealed at 400{\deg} for different
annealing times. With progressive annealing a noticeable trend was observed, in
which the basal nuclei gradually diminished and eventually vanished from the
annealed microstructure. In contrast, the off-basal nuclei exhibited continuous
growth, ultimately becoming the dominant contributors to the recrystallization
texture. The study therefore emphasizes the importance of particular nucleation
sites that generate favorably oriented off-basal nuclei, which over the course
of recrystallization outcompete the neighboring basal-oriented nuclei in terms
of growth, and thereby dominate the recrystallization texture.

atomistic simulations. The (1-105) planar faults with a displacement vector of

Frank-Kasper packing and therefore enable the accommodation of plastic strain
at low temperatures without requiring atomic diffusion. The intersections
between the (1-105) planar faults and basal slip result in stress concentration
and crack nucleation during loading.

Permanent magnets are of great importance due to their vast applications.
MnBi has been proposed to be a potential permanent magnet that can be widely
used while past efforts have been focused on optimizing the ferromagnetic
low-temperature phase of MnBi. Herein, we report a series of new materials,
CuxMn1-xBi, crystallizing in a high-temperature-phase (HTP) MnBi-related
structure. We synthesized single crystals of CuxMn1-xBi and found that they
crystallize in an unreported trigonal structure (P -31c). Magnetic properties
measurements imply high-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering and
low-temperature ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic (FM/FiM) ordering. By analyzing
the doping effect on crystal structure and magnetic properties, we established
a magnetic phase diagram for Cu-doped MnBi and attributed the AFM and FM/FiM to
two different atomic sites of Mn. The newly found materials can help interpret
the structure-magnetism relation in HTP-MnBi and open a new way for
investigating future MnBi permanent magnets.

Recently, intriguing physical properties have been unraveled in anisotropic
semiconductors, in which the in-plane electronic band structure anisotropy
often originates from the low crystallographic symmetry. The atomic chain is
the ultimate limit in material downscaling for electronics, a frontier for
establishing an entirely new field of one-dimensional quantum materials.
Electronic and structural properties of chain-like InTe are essential for
better understanding of device applications such as thermoelectrics. Here, we
use scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements and
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to directly image the in-plane
structural anisotropy in tetragonal Indium Telluride (InTe). As results, we
report the direct observation of one-dimensional In1+ chains in InTe. We
demonstrate that InTe exhibits a band gap of about 0.40 +-0.02 eV located at
the M point of the Brillouin zone. Additionally, line defects are observed in
our sample, were attributed to In1+ chain vacancy along the c-axis, a general
feature in many other TlSe-like compounds. Our STS and DFT results prove that
the presence of In1+ induces localized gap state, located near the valence band
maximum (VBM). This acceptor state is responsible for the high intrinsic p-type
doping of InTe that we also confirm using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy.

Destructive interference between electron wavefunctions on the
two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattice induces an electronic flat band, which
could host a variety of interesting many-body quantum states. Key to realize
these proposals is to demonstrate the real space localization of kagome flat
band electrons. In particular, the extent to which the often more complex
lattice structure and orbital composition of realistic materials counteract the
localizing effect of destructive interference, described by the 2D kagome
lattice model, is hitherto unknown. We used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
to visualize the non-trivial Wannier states of a kagome flat band at the
surface of CoSn, a kagome metal. We find that the local density of states
associated with the flat bands of CoSn is localized at the center of the kagome
lattice, consistent with theoretical expectations for their corresponding
Wannier states. Our results show that these states exhibit an extremely small
localization length of two to three angstroms concomitant with a strongly
renormalized quasiparticle velocity, which is comparable to that of moir\'e
superlattices. Hence, interaction effects in the flat bands of CoSn could be
much more significant than previously thought. Our findings provide fundamental
insight into the electronic properties of kagome metals and are a key step for
future research on emergent many-body states in transition metal based kagome
materials.

We study the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of bcc Fe and fcc Co using the
recently suggested heat-conserving three-temperature model (HC3TM), together
with atomistic spin- and lattice dynamics simulations. It is shown that this
type of Langevin-based simulation is able to reproduce observed trends of the
ultrafast magnetization dynamics of fcc Co and bcc Fe, in agreement with
previous findings for fcc Ni. The simulations are performed by using parameters
that to as large extent as possible are obtained from electronic structure
theory. The one parameter that was not calculated in this way, was the damping
term used for the lattice dynamics simulations, and here a range of parameters
were investigated. It is found that this term has a large influence on the
details of the magnetization dynamics. The dynamics of iron and cobalt is
compared with previous results for nickel and similarities and differences in
the materials' behavior are analysed following the absorption of a femtosecond
laser pulse. Importantly, for all elements investigated so far with this model,
we obtain a linear relationship between the value of the maximally demagnetized
state and the fluence of the laser pulse, which is in agreement with
experiments.

We complete the kinetic theory of inhomogeneous systems with long-range
interactions initiated in previous works. We use a simpler and more physical
formalism. We consider a system of particles submitted to a small external
stochastic perturbation and determine the response of the system to the
perturbation. We derive the diffusion tensor and the friction by polarization
of a test particle. We introduce a general Fokker-Planck equation involving a
diffusion term and a friction term. When the friction by polarization can be
neglected, we obtain a secular dressed diffusion (SDD) equation sourced by the
external noise. When the external perturbation is created by a discrete
collection of $N$ field particles, we obtain the inhomogeneous Lenard-Balescu
kinetic equation reducing to the inhomogeneous Landau kinetic equation when
collective effects are neglected. We consider a multi-species system of
particles. When the field particles are at statistical equilibrium (thermal
bath), we establish the proper expression of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem for systems with long-range interactions relating the power spectrum of
the fluctuations to the response function of the system. In that case, the
friction and diffusion coefficients satisfy the Einstein relation and the
Fokker-Planck equation reduces to the inhomogeneous Kramers equation. We also
consider a gas of Brownian particles with long-range interactions described by
$N$ coupled stochastic Langevin equations and determine its mean and mesoscopic
evolution. We discuss the notion of stochastic kinetic equations and the role
of fluctuations possibly triggering random transitions from one equilibrium
state to the other. Our presentation parallels the one given for
two-dimensional point vortices in a previous paper [P.H. Chavanis, Eur. Phys.

Recently, charge density wave (CDW) has been observed well below the order of
antiferromagnetism (AFM) in kagome FeGe in which magnetism and CDW are
intertwined to form an emergent quantum ground state. The mechanism of CDW
precipitating from an A-type AFM of Fe kagome sublattice is intensively
debated. The structural distortion originating from the CDW has yet to be
accurately determined in FeGe. Here we resolved the structure model of the CDW
in annealed FeGe crystals through single crystal x-ray diffraction via a
synchrotron radiation source. The annealed crystals exhibit strong CDW
transition signals exemplified by sharp magnetic susceptibility drop and
specific heat jump, as well as intense superlattice reflections from 2 $\times$
2 $\times$ 2 CDW order. Occupational disorder of Ge atoms resulting from
short-range CDW correlations above $T_\mathrm{CDW}$ has also been identified
from the structure refinements. The dimerization of Ge atoms along c axis has
been demonstrated to be the dominant distortion for CDW. The Fe kagome and Ge
honeycomb sublattices only undergo subtle distortions. Occupational disorder of
Ge atoms is also proved to exist in the CDW phase due to the random selection
of partial Ge sites to be dimerized to realize the structural distortion. Our
work paves the way to understanding the unconventional nature of CDW in FeGe
not only by solving the structural distortion below $T_\mathrm{CDW}$ and
identifying fluctuations above it but also by rationalizing the synthesis of
high-quality crystals for in-depth investigations in the future.

<h3>High-$T_c$ superconductivity by mobilizing local spin singlets and  possible route to higher $T_c$ in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09044" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09044</a>

<i>Qiong Qin, Yi-feng Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We clarify the pairing mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in bilayer
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure by employing the static auxiliary field
Monte Carlo approach to simulate a minimal effective model that contains local
$d_{z^2}$ inter-layer spin singlets and metallic $d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands.
Superconductivity is induced when the local spin singlet pairs are mobilized
and attain long-distance phase coherence by hybridization with the metallic
bands. We find a dual role of hybridization that not only induces global phase
coherence but also competes with the spin singlet formation. This lead to a
tentative phase diagram where $T_c$ varies nonmonotonically with the
hybridization, in good correspondence with experimental observation. A roughly
linear relation is obtained for realistic hopping and hybridization parameters:
$T_c\approx 0.05 J$, where $J$ is the inter-layer superexchange interaction. We
emphasize the peculiar tunability of the bilayer structure and propose that
$T_c$ may be further enhanced by applying uniaxial pressure along the $c$ axis
on superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our work provides numerical evidences for
the pairing mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and
points out a potential route to achieve even higher $T_c$.

Transduction of quantum information between distinct quantum systems is an
essential step in various applications, including quantum networks and quantum
computing. However, quantum transduction needs to mediate between photons with
vastly different frequencies, making it challenging to design high-performance
transducers, due to multifaceted and sometimes conflicting requirements. In
this work, we first discuss some general principles for quantum transducer
design, and then propose solid-state anti-ferromagnetic topological insulators
to serve as highly effective transducers. First, topological insulators exhibit
band-inversion, which can greatly enhance their optical responses. Coupled with
their robust spin-orbit coupling and high spin density, this property leads to
strong nonlinear interaction in topological insulators, thereby substantially
improving transduction efficiency. Second, the anti-ferromagnetic order can
minimize the detrimental influence on other neighboring quantum systems due to
magnetic interactions. Using $\rm MnBi_2Te_4$ as an example, we showcase that
unit transduction fidelity can be achieved with modest experimental
requirements, while the transduction bandwidth can reach the GHz range. The
strong nonlinear interaction in magnetic topological insulators can find
diverse applications, including the generation of entanglement between photons
of distinct frequencies.

<br>
Recent experiments and calculations in topological semimetals have observed
anomalously strong second-order optical nonlinearity, but yet whether the
enhancement also occurs at surfaces of topological semimetals in general
remains an open question. In this work, we tackle this problem by measuring
polarization-dependent and rotational-anisotropy optical second harmonic
generation (SHG) from centrosymmetric type-II Dirac semimetal PdTe$_2$. We
found the SHG to follow C$_{3v}$ surface symmetry with a time-varying intensity
dictated by the oxidation kinetics of the material after its surface cleavage,
indicating the surface origin of SHG. Quantitative characterization of the
surface nonlinear susceptibility indicates a large out-of-plane response of
PdTe$_2$ with $|\chi_{ccc}^{(2)}|$ up to 25 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ m$^2$/V. Our
results support the topological surfaces/interfaces as a new route toward
applications of nonlinear optical effects with released symmetry constraints,
and demonstrate SHG as a viable means to in situ study of kinetics of
topological surfaces.

The development of multidimensional, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques calls
for the development of efficient computational schemes that allow for the
simulation of such experiments and thus for the interpretation of the
corresponding results. In this work, we present the development of a fully
first-principles scheme to compute two-dimensional electron spectroscopy maps
based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory. The interface of
this approach with the Ehrenfest scheme for molecular dynamics enables the
inclusion of vibronic effects in the calculations. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method by applying it to prototypical molecules such as
benzene, pyridine, and pyrene. We discuss the role of the approximations that
inevitably enter the adopted theoretical framework and set the stage for
further extensions of the proposed method.

<h3>Charging capacitors from thermal fluctuations using diodes</h3>

<br>
We theoretically consider a graphene ripple as a Brownian particle coupled to
an energy storage circuit. When circuit and particle are at the same
temperature, the second law forbids harvesting energy from the thermal motion
of the Brownian particle, even if the circuit contains a rectifying diode.
However, when the circuit contains a junction followed by two diodes wired in
opposition, the approach to equilibrium may become ultraslow. Detailed balance
is temporarily broken as current flows between the two diodes and charges
storage capacitors. The energy harvested by each capacitor comes from the
thermal bath of the diodes while the system obeys the first and second laws of
thermodynamics.

<h3>Barrier and finite size effects on the extension of topological  surface-states into magnetic insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>Eirik Holm Fyhn, Hendrik Bentmann, Jacob Linder</i>
<br>
<br>
The interplay between magnetic and topological order can give rise to
phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The extension of
topological surface states into magnetic insulators (MIs) has been proposed as
an alternative to using intrinsically magnetic topological insulators (TIs).
Here, we theoretically study how this extension of surface states into a
magnetic insulator are influenced both by the interface barrier potential
separating a topological insulator and a magnetic insulator and by finite size
effects in such structures. We find that the the gap in the surface states
depends non-monotonically on the barrier strength. A small, but finite, barrier
potential turns out to be advantageous as it permits the surface states to
penetrate even further into the MI. Moreover, we find that due to finite size
effects in thin samples, increasing the spin-splitting in the MI can actually
decrease the gap of the surface states, in contrast to the usual expectation
that the gap opens as the spin-splitting increases.

<br>
Nonlocal and quantum mechanical phenomena in noble metal nanostructures
become increasingly crucial when the relevant length scales in hybrid
nanostructures reach the few-nanometer regime. In practice, such mesoscopic
effects at metal-dielectric interfaces can be described using exemplary
surface-response functions (SRFs) embodied by the Feibelman $d$-parameters.
Here we show that SRFs dramatically influence quantum electrodynamic phenomena
-- such as the Purcell enhancement and Lamb shift -- for quantum emitters close
to a diverse range of noble metal nanostructures interfacing different
homogeneous media. Dielectric environments with higher permittivities are shown
to increase the magnitude of SRFs calculated within the specular-reflection
model. In parallel, the role of SRFs is enhanced in nanostructures
characterized by large surface-to-volume ratios, such as thin planar metallic
films or shells of core-shell nanoparticles. By investigating emitter quantum
dynamics close to such plasmonic architectures, we show that decreasing the
width of the metal region, or increasing the permittivity of the interfacing
dielectric, leads to a significant change in the Purcell enhancement, Lamb
shift, and visible far-field spontaneous emission spectrum, as an immediate
consequence of SRFs. We anticipate that fitting the theoretically modelled
spectra to experiments could allow for experimental determination of the
$d$-parameters.

<h3>Bowstring effect as a trigger for flux instabilities in thin  superconductors</h3>

Magnetic vortices resemble bowstrings stretched across a corner at the
initial stage of their penetration into a flat superconducting sample of a
rectangular cross-section. As the external magnetic field $H_e$ reaches the
threshold level $H_{th}$, a bowstring is "released" and instantaneously
contracted in length with a substantial heat generation. This heat can serve as
a trigger for nucleation of a flux instability (avalanche). At $H_e \approx
\sqrt{2}H_{th}$ a usual vortex penetration starts at flat edges, and the
bowstring mechanism is no longer effective. We describe the geometry of
bowstring-like vortices, find $H_{th}$ for disk and strip shaped
superconductors as a function of their thickness to width ratio, and determine
the heat effect related to a bowstring release. Our results enable a novel
treatment of numerous experimental data on flux instabilities and avalanche
type penetration in flat superconducting samples. A moderate anisotropy of a
superconducting penetration depth ($\lambda_c > \lambda_{ab}$) diminishes or
even completely removes the bowstring effect. This explains the absence of
spontaneous instabilities in epitaxial
$\mathrm{YBa}_{2}\mathrm{Cu}_{3}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta }$ films at all
temperatures and in $\mathrm{MgB_{2}}$ above 10 K.

The inverse Faraday effect is an opto-magnetic phenomenon that describes the
ability of circularly polarized light to induce magnetism in solids. The
capability of light to control magnetic order in solid state materials and
devices is of interest for a variety of applications, such as magnetic
recording, quantum computation and spintronic technologies. However,
significant gaps in understanding about the effect persist, such as what
material properties govern the magnitude of the effect in metals. In this work,
we report time-resolved measurements of the specular inverse Faraday effect in
non-magnetic metals, i.e., the magneto-optic Kerr effect induced by circularly
polarized light. We measure this specular inverse Faraday effect in Cu, Pd, Pt,
W, Ta, and Au at a laser wavelength of 783 nm. For Ta and W, we investigate
both {\alpha} and \{beta} phases. We observe that excitation of these metals
with circularly polarized light induces significant circular dichroism. This
nonlinear magneto-optical response to circularly polarized light is an order of
magnitude larger in {\alpha}-W than other metals, e.g., Pt, Au, and is greater
than nearly all other reported values for IFE in other materials. Our results
benchmark the range of IFE that can be observed in non-magnetic metals and
provide insight into what material properties govern the inverse Faraday effect
in metals.

<h3>Dielectric Screening and Electric Field Control of Ferromagnetism at the  CaMnO$_3$/CaRuO$_3$ Interface</h3>

<br>
<br>
Control of magnetism by an applied electric field is a desirable technique
for the functionalization of magnetic materials. Motivated by recent
experiments, we study the electric field control of the interfacial magnetism
of CaRuO$_3$/CaMnO$_3$ (CRO/CMO) (001), a prototype interface between a
non-magnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Even without the
electric field, the interfacial CMO layer acquires a ferromagnetic moment due
to a spin-canted state, caused by the Anderson-Hasegawa double exchange (DEX)
between the Mn moments and the leaked electrons from the CRO side. An electric
field would alter the carrier density at the interface, leading to the
possibility of controlling the magnetism, since DEX is sensitive to the carrier
density. We study this effect quantitatively usingdensity-functional
calculations in the slab geometry. We find a text-book like dielectric
screening of the electric field, which introduces polarization charges at the
interfaces and the surfaces. The extra charge at the interface enhances the
ferromagnetism via the DEX interaction, while away from the interface the
original AFM state of the Mn layers remains unchanged. The effect could have
potential application in spintronics devices.

We present a comprehensive study of the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in a
family of kagome magnets with formula RMn6Sn6 (R=Tb, Ho, Er, and Lu). These
materials have a small rare-earth content and tunable magnetic ordering, hence
they provide a venue to study the fundamentals of the MCE. We examine the
effect of different types of order (ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and
antiferromagnetic) and the presence of a metamagnetic transition on the MCE. We
extend the study to a high-entropy rare-earth alloys of the family, and
conclude with several guidelines for enhancing the MCE in tunable magnetic
materials with a small rare-earth content.

In a recent publication [Wurdack et al., Nat. Comm. 14:1026 (2023)], it was
shown that in microcavities containing atomically thin semiconductors
non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can lead to negative exciton polariton masses.
We show that mass-sign reversal can occur generally in radiative resonances in
two dimensions (without cavity) and derive conditions for it (critical
dephasing threshold etc.). In monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, this
phenomenon is not invalidated by the strong electron-hole exchange interaction,
which is known to make the exciton massless.

A spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet is a prototypical frustrated
quantum magnet, which exhibits remarkable quantum many-body effects that arise
from the synergy between geometric spin frustration and quantum fluctuations.
It can host quantum frustrated magnetic topological phenomena like quantum spin
liquid (QSL) states, highlighted by the presence of fractionalized
quasiparticles within a continuum of magnetic excitations. In this work, we use
neutron scattering to study CoZnMo$_3$O$_8$, which has a triangular lattice of
Jeff = 1/2 Co2+ ions with octahedral coordination. We found a
wave-vector-dependent excitation continuum at low energy that disappears with
increasing temperature. Although these excitations are reminiscent of a spin
excitation continuum in a QSL state, their presence in CoZnMo$_3$O$_8$
originates from magnetic intersite disorder-induced dynamic spin states with
peculiar excitations. Our results, therefore, give direct experimental evidence
for the presence of a disorder-induced spin excitation continuum.

Chiral topological orders formed in correlated fermion systems have been
widely explored. However, the mechanism on how they emerge from interacting
fermions is still unclear. Here, we propose a susceptibility condition. Under
this condition, we show that chiral topological orders can spontaneously take
place in correlated fermion systems. The condition leads to a low-energy
effective theory of bosons with strong frustration, mimicking the flat band
systems. The frustration then melts the long-range orders and results in
topological orders with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We apply the theory to
strongly-correlated semiconductors doped to the metallic phase. A novel
excitonic topological order with semionic excitations and chiral excitonic edge
state is revealed, which goes beyond the common knowledge that excitonic phases
are generally formed in semimetals or semiconductors. These results demonstrate
an unprecedented indicator for chiral topological orders, which bridges the
existing gap between interacting fermions and correlated topological matter.

Carbon, as one of the most common element in the earth, constructs hundreds
of allotropic phases to present rich physical nature. In this work, by
combining the ab inito calculations and symmetry analyses method, we
systematically study a large number of allotropes of carbon (703), and
discovered 315 ideal topological phononic materials and 32 topological
electronic materials. The ideal topological phononic nature includes single,
charge-two, three, four Weyl honons, the Dirac or Weyl nodal lines phonons, and
nodal surfaces phonons. And the topological electron nature ncludes topological
insulator, (Type-II) Dirac points, triple nodal points, the Dirac (Weyl) nodal
lines, quadratic nodal lines and so on. For convenience, we take the uni in SG
178 and pbg in SG 230 as the examples to describe the topological features in
the main. We find that it is the coexistence of single pair Weyl phonons and
one-nodal surfaces phonons in the uni in SG 178, which can form the single
surface arc in the (100) surface BZ and isolated double-helix surface states
(IDHSSs)in the (110) surface BZ. In topological semimetal pbg in SG 230, we
find that the perfect triple degenerate nodal point can be found in the near
Fermi level, and it can form the clear surface states in the (001) and (110)
surface BZ. Our work not only greatly expands the topological features in all
allotropes of carbon, but also provide many ideal platforms to study the
topological electrons and phonons.

A nonmagnetic phase transition at $T_0 \sim 12$ K in the tetragonal system
CeCoSi with a Kramers doublet ground state is reminiscent of an electric
quadrupole ordering, even though its well-separated crystal-electric-field
(CEF) levels are unlikely to acquire higher-order multipole degrees of freedom.
Here, we report $^{59}$Co nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies that are
highly compatible with a ferroic quadrupole ordering below $T_0$. Changes in
the NMR spectra below $T_0$ suggest that an external magnetic field induces
ferroic Ce dipole moments orthogonal to the field, enabling domain selection in
the nonmagnetic phase. Our findings suggest the presence of a ferroic
$O_{zx}$-type quadrupole component in CeCoSi and demonstrate that quadrupole
ordering may occur under well-separated CEF levels in tetragonal systems.

Phase separation naturally occurs in a variety of magnetic materials and it
often has a major impact on both electric and magnetotransport properties. In
resistive switching systems, phase separation can be created on demand by
inducing local switching, which provides an opportunity to tune the electronic
and magnetic state of the device by applying voltage. Here we explore the
magnetotransport properties in the ferromagnetic oxide (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)
during the electrical triggering of an intrinsic metal-insulator transition
(MIT) that produces volatile resistive switching. This switching occurs in a
characteristic spatial pattern, i.e., the formation of an insulating barrier
perpendicular to the current flow, enabling an electrically actuated
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase separation. At the threshold
voltage of the MIT triggering, both anisotropic and colossal magnetoresistances
exhibit anomalies including a large increase in magnitude and a sign flip.
Computational analysis revealed that these anomalies originate from the
coupling between the switching-induced phase separation state and the intrinsic
magnetoresistance of LSMO. This work demonstrates that driving the MIT material
into an out-of-equilibrium resistive switching state provides the means to
electrically control of the magnetotransport phenomena.

The nanoconfinement of water can result in dramatic differences in its
physical and chemical properties compared to bulk water. However, a detailed
molecular-level understanding of these properties is still lacking. Vibrational
spectroscopy, such as Raman and infrared, is a popular experimental tool for
studying the structure and dynamics of water, and is often complemented by
atomistic simulations to interpret experimental spectra, but there have been
few theoretical spectroscopy studies of nanoconfined water using
first-principles methods at ambient conditions, let alone under extreme
pressure-temperature conditions. Here, we computed the Raman and IR spectra of
water nanoconfined by graphene at ambient and extreme pressure-temperature
conditions using ab intio simulations. Our results revealed alterations in the
Raman stretching and low-frequency bands due to the graphene confinement. We
also found spectroscopic evidence indicating that nanoconfinement considerably
changes the tetrahedral hydrogen bond network, which is typically found in bulk
water. Furthermore, we observed an unusual bending band in the Raman spectrum
at ~10 GPa and 1000 K, which is attributed to the unique molecular structure of
confined ionic water. Additionally, we found that at ~20 GPa and 1000 K,
confined water transformed into a superionic fluid, making it challenging to
identify the IR stretching band. Finally, we computed the ionic conductivity of

This work analyzes the propagation of a transverse domain wall (DW) motion
under the action of an electric current along a nanowire (NW) with a curvature
gradient. Our results evidence that the curvature gradient induces a chiral
spin-transfer torque (CSTT) whose effect on the DW motion depends on the
direction along which the DW points. The origin of the CSTT is explained in
terms of a position and phase-dependent effective field associated with the DW
profile and the electric current direction. Finally, our results reveal that
this chiral mechanism can also affect the behavior of other magnetization
collective modes, such as spin waves. This work shows the emergence of
curvature-induced chiral spin transport and highlights a new phenomenon to be
considered for designing spintronic devices.

<h3>Reconciling magnetoelectric response and time-reversal symmetry in  non-magnetic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators</h3>

A delicate tension complicates the relationship between the topological
magnetoelectric effect in three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
insulators (TIs) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS). TRS underlies a particular
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification of the electronic ground state of a
bulk insulator and the associated quantization of the magnetoelectric
coefficient calculated using linear response theory, but according to standard
symmetry arguments simultaneously forbids any physically meaningful
magnetoelectric response. This tension between theories of magnetoelectric
response in bulk and finite-sized materials originates from the distinct
approaches required to introduce notions of polarization and orbital
magnetization in those fundamentally different environments. In this work we
argue for a modified interpretation of the bulk linear response calculations in
non-magnetic TIs that is more plainly consistent with TRS, and use this
interpretation to discuss the effect's observation - still absent over a decade
after its prediction. Our analysis is reinforced by microscopic bulk and thin
film calculations carried out using a simplified but still realistic model for
the well established V$_2$VI$_3$ (V $=$ (Sb,Bi) and VI $=$ (Se,Te)) family of
non-magnetic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TIs. We conclude that the topological
magnetoelectric effect in non-magnetic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TIs is activated by
magnetic surface dopants, and that the charge density response to magnetic
fields and the orbital magnetization response to electric fields in a given
sample are controlled in part by the configuration of those dopants.

<h3>Localization-delocalization Transition in an electromagnetically induced  photonic lattice</h3>

We investigate the localization-delocalization transition (LDT) in an
electromagnetically induced photonic lattice. A four-level tripod-type scheme
in atomic ensembles is proposed to generate an effective photonic moir\'{e}
lattice through the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) mechanism.
By taking advantage of the tunable atomic coherence, we show that both periodic
(commensurable) and aperiodic (incommensurable) structure can be created in
such a photonic moir\'{e} lattice via adjusting the twist angle between two
superimposed periodic patterns with square primitive. Furthermore, we also find
that by tuning the amplitudes of these two superimposed periodic patterns, the
localization-delocalization transition occurs for the light propagating in the
aperiodic moir\'{e} lattice. Such localization is shown to link the fact that
the flat bands of moir\'{e} lattice support quasi-nondiffracting localized
modes and thus induce the localization of the initially localized beam. It
would provide a promising approach to control the light propagation via the
electromagnetically induced photonic lattice.

<h3>A fresh view on Frenkel excitons: Electron-hole pair exchange and  many-body formalism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09299</a>
<br>
<i>Shiue-Yuan Shiau, Monique Combescot</i>
<br>
<br>
We here present a fresh approach to Frenkel excitons in cubic semiconductor
crystals, with a special focus on the spin and spatial degeneracies of the
electronic states. This approach uses a second quantization formulation of the
problem in terms of creation operators for electronic states on all lattice
sites -- their creation operators being true fermion operators in the
tight-binding limit valid for semiconductors hosting Frenkel excitons. This
operator formalism avoids using cumbersome ($6N_s$ x $6N_s$) Slater
determinants -- 2 for spin, 3 for spatial degeneracy and $N_s$ for the number
of lattice sites -- to represent state wave functions out of which the Frenkel
exciton eigenstates are derived. A deep understanding of the tricky Coulomb
physics that takes place in the Frenkel exciton problem, is a prerequisite for
possibly diagonalizing this very large matrix analytically. This is done in
three steps: (i) the first diagonalization, with respect to lattice sites,
follows from transforming excitations on the $N_s$ lattice sites
$\mathbf{R}_\ell$ into $N_s$ exciton waves $\mathbf{K}_n$, by using appropriate
phase prefactors; (ii) the second diagonalization, with respect to spin,
follows from the introduction of spin-singlet and spin-triplet electron-hole
pair states, through the commonly missed sign change when transforming
electron-absence operators into hole operators; (iii) the third
diagonalization, with respect to threefold spatial degeneracy, leads to the
splitting of the exciton level into one longitudinal and two transverse modes,
that result from the singular interlevel Coulomb scattering in the small
$\mathbf{K}_n$ limit.

<h3>Transonic and supershear crack propagation driven by geometric  nonlinearities</h3>

Linear elastic fracture mechanics theory predicts that the speed of crack
growth is limited by the Rayleigh wave speed. Although many experimental
observations and numerical simulations have supported this prediction, some
exceptions have raised questions about its validity. The underlying reasons for
these discrepancies and the precise limiting speed of dynamic cracks remain
unknown. Here, we demonstrate that tensile (mode I) cracks can exceed the
Rayleigh wave speed and propagate at supershear speeds. We show that taking
into account geometric non-linearities, inherent in most materials, is
sufficient to enable such propagation modes. These geometric non-linearities
modify the crack-tip singularity, resulting in different crack-tip opening
displacements, cohesive zone behavior, and energy flows towards the crack tip.

<h3>Non-Adiabatic Effect in Topological and Interacting Charge Pumping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09316</a>
<br>
<i>Fan Yang, Xingyu Li, Hui Zhai</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological charge pumping occurs in the adiabatic limit, and the
non-adiabatic effect due to finite ramping velocity reduces the pumping
efficiency and leads to deviation from quantized charge pumping. In this work,
we discuss the relation between this deviation from quantized charge pumping
and the entanglement generation after a pumping circle. In this simplest
setting, we show that purity $\mathcal{P}$ of the half system reduced density
matrix equals to $\mathcal{R}$ defined as $(1-\kappa)^2+\kappa^2$, where
$\kappa$ denotes the pumping efficiency. In generic situations, we argue
$\mathcal{P}<\mathcal{R}$ and the pumping efficiency can provide an upper bound
for purity and, therefore, a lower bound for generated entanglement. To support
this conjecture, we propose a solvable pumping scheme in the
Rice--Mele--Hubbard model, which can be represented as brick-wall type quantum
circuit model. With this pumping scheme, numerical calculation of charge
pumping only needs to include at most six sites, and therefore, the interaction
and the finite temperature effects can be both included reliably in the exact
diagonalization calculation. The numerical results using the solvable pumping
circle identify two regimes where the pumping efficiency is sensitive to
ramping velocity and support the conjecture $\mathcal{P}<\mathcal{R}$ when both
interaction and finite temperature effects are present.

<br>
<br>
Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain the conformational
phase diagram of a charged polymer in the presence of oppositely charged
counterions and neutral attractive crowders for monovalent, divalent and
trivalent counterion valencies. We demonstrate that the charged polymer can
exist in three phases: (1) an extended phase for low charge densities and weak
polymer-crowder attractive interactions ($CE$), (2) a collapsed phase for high
charge densities and weak polymer-crowder attractive interactions, primarily
driven by counterion condensation ($CCI$), and (3) a collapsed phase for strong
polymer-crowder attractive interactions, irrespective of the charge density,
driven by crowders acting as bridges or crosslinks ($CCB$). Importantly, the
simulations reveal that the interaction with crowders can induce collapse,
despite the presence of strong repulsive electrostatic interactions, and can
replace condensed counterions to facilitate a direct transition from the $CCI$
and $CE$ phases to the $CCB$ phase.

The study of the electromagnetic properties of 2D materials is an area of
intensive research. Most of the efforts in the subject have been oriented
towards the understanding and modelling of the microscopic behaviour of the
charge carriers within the medium. Albeit there is a well established manner to
express London's equations in the language of differential geometry, an
effective geometric theory of the macroscopic phenomenon is still lacking. In
this work we concentrate in obtaining the underlying geometric structure of
superconductivity in two dimensional materials. To this effect, we produce an
intrinsic framework which allows us to clearly identify the geometric
assumptions leading to London's equations and the Meissner state. Specifically,
we show that any two-dimensional medium whose response to an externally applied
electromagnetic field results in a divergence free geodesically flowing induced
current must be a superconductor. In this manner, we conclude that the
underlying geometry of this type of media is that of a three dimensional
Lorentzian contact manifold. Moreover, we show that the geometric condition
macroscopically encoding the superconducting phenomena emerges from a
variational principle, exhibiting that the macroscopic hallmark of
superconductivity is expressed as the non-vanishing of the induced current's
helicity.

The response of superfluids to the external rotation, evidenced by emergence
of quantised vortices, distinguishes them from conventional fluids. In this
work, we demonstrate that the number of vortices in a stirred polariton
condensate depends on the characteristic size of the employed rotating
potential induced by the nonresonant laser excitation. For smaller sizes, a
single vortex with a topological charge of +-1 corresponding to the stirring
direction is formed. However, for larger optical traps, clusters of two or
three co-rotating vortices appear in the narrow range of GHz stirring speed.

The tensor network representation of a state in higher dimensions, say a
projected entangled-pair state (PEPS), is typically obtained indirectly through
variational optimization or imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolution. Here, we
propose a divide-and-conquer approach to directly construct a PEPS
representation for free-fermion states admitting descriptions in terms of
filling exponentially localized Wannier functions. Our approach relies on first
obtaining a tree tensor network description of the state in local subregions.
Next, a stacking procedure is used to combine the local trees into a PEPS.
Lastly, the local tensors are compressed to obtain a more efficient
description. We demonstrate our construction for states in one and two
dimensions, including the ground state of an obstructed atomic insulator on the
square lattice.

<h3>Spin-wave dispersion and magnon chirality in multiferroic TbMnO3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Inelastic neutron scattering experiments combining time-of-flight and
polarized techniques yield a comprehensive picture of the magnon dispersion in
multiferroic TbMnO3 including the dynamic chirality. Taking into account only
Mn3+ moments, spin-wave calculations including nearest-neighbor interactions,
frustrating next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as single-ion anisotropy and
antisymmetric terms describe the energy dispersion and the distribution of
neutron scattering intensity in the multiferroic state very well. Polarized
neutron scattering reveals strong dynamic chirality of both signs that may be
controlled by external electric fields in the multiferroic phase. Also above
the onset of long-range multiferroic order in zero electric field, a small
inelastic chiral component can be inverted by an electric field. The
microscopic spin-wave calculations fully explain also the dynamic chirality of
magnetic excitations, which is imprinted by the static chirality of the
multiferroic phase. The ordering of Tb3+ moments at lower temperature reduces
the broadening of magnons but also renders the magnon dispersion more complex.

Bistable mechanisms are prevalent across a broad spectrum of applications due
to their ability to maintain two distinct stable states. Their energy
consumption is predominantly confined to the process of state transitions,
thereby enhancing their efficiency. However, the transition often requires two
distinct inputs, implicating the requirement of multiple actuators. Here, we
propose an elastic and contactless design strategy for inducing state
transitions in bistable mechanisms, requiring only a single cyclic input. The
strategy leverages internal information, interpreted as system state, as an
extra input to make a weighted decision for transitioning to the subsequent
state. We characterize the behavior using a spring-based rigid-body model,
consisting of a column near bifurcation, combined with a non-linear spring
connected to a bistable element that represents the information state. The
results show that a nonlinear spring with a quadratic stiffness function, i.e.,
representing internal instability, is crucial for regulating state-switching
behavior. We then demonstrate this design strategy by developing a monolithic
and compliant design embodiment and experimentally evaluate its behavior.

<h3>Ab initio quantum approach to electron-hole exchange for semiconductors  hosting Wannier excitons</h3>

We propose a quantum approach to "electron-hole exchange", better named
electron-hole pair exchange, that makes use of the second quantization
formalism to describe the problem in terms of Bloch-state electron operators.
This approach renders transparent the fact that such singular effect comes from
interband Coulomb processes. We first show that, due to the sign change when
turning from valence-electron destruction operator to hole creation operator,
the interband Coulomb interaction only acts on spin-singlet electron-hole
pairs, just like the interband electron-photon interaction, thereby making
these spin-singlet pairs optically bright. We then show that when written in
terms of reciprocal lattice vectors ${\bf G}_m$, the singularity of the
interband Coulomb scattering in the small wave-vector transfer limit entirely
comes from the ${\bf G}_m = 0$ term, which renders its singular behavior easy
to calculate. Comparison with the usual real-space formulation in which the
singularity appears through a sum of "long-range processes" over all ${\bf
R}\not= 0$ lattice vectors once more proves that periodic systems are easier to
handle in terms of reciprocal vectors ${\bf G}_m$ than in terms of lattice
vectors $\bf R$. Well-accepted consequences of the electron-hole exchange on
excitons and polaritons are reconsidered and refuted for different major
reasons.

Single-particle traces of the diffusive motion of molecules, cells, or
animals are by-now routinely measured, similar to stochastic records of stock
prices or weather data. Deciphering the stochastic mechanism behind the
recorded dynamics is vital in understanding the observed systems. Typically,
the task is to decipher the exact type of diffusion and/or to determine system
parameters. The tools used in this endeavor are currently revolutionized by
modern machine-learning techniques. In this Perspective we provide an overview
over recently introduced methods in machine-learning for diffusive time series,
most notably, those successfully competing in the
Anomalous-Diffusion-Challenge. As such methods are often criticized for their
lack of interpretability, we focus on means to include uncertainty estimates
and feature-based approaches, both improving interpretability and providing
concrete insight into the learning process of the machine. We expand the
discussion by examining predictions on different out-of-distribution data. We
also comment on expected future developments.

<h3>Dimensional measures of generalized entropy</h3>

Entropy is useful in statistical problems as a measure of irreversibility,
randomness, mixing, dispersion, and number of microstates. However, there
remains ambiguity over the precise mathematical formulation of entropy,
generalized beyond the additive definition pioneered by Boltzmann, Gibbs, and
Shannon (applicable to thermodynamic equilibria). For generalized entropies to
be applied rigorously to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, we suggest that
there is a need for a physically interpretable (dimensional) framework that can
be connected to dynamical processes operating in phase space. In this work, we
introduce dimensional measures of entropy that admit arbitrary invertible
weight functions (subject to curvature and convergence requirements). These
"dimensional entropies" have physical dimensions of phase-space volume and
represent the extent of level sets of the distribution function. Dimensional
entropies with power-law weight functions (related to R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis
entropies) are particularly robust, as they do not require any internal
dimensional parameters due to their scale invariance. We also point out the
existence of composite entropy measures that can be constructed from
functionals of dimensional entropies. We calculate the response of the
dimensional entropies to perturbations, showing that for a structured
distribution, perturbations have the largest impact on entropies weighted at a
similar phase-space scale. This elucidates the link between dynamics
(perturbations) and statistics (entropies). Finally, we derive corresponding
generalized maximum-entropy distributions. Dimensional entropies may be useful
as a diagnostic (for irreversibility) and for theoretical modeling (if the
underlying irreversible processes in phase space are understood) in chaotic and
complex systems, such as collisionless systems of particles with long-range
interactions.

<h3>Eulerian framework for contact between solids represented as phase  fields</h3>

Mechanical contact between solids is almost exclusively modeled in Lagrangian
frameworks. While these frameworks have been developed extensively and applied
successfully to numerous contact problems, they generally require complex
algorithms for contact detection and resolution. These challenges become
particularly important when contact appears between solids with evolving
boundaries, such as in systems where crystals grow in a constrained space. In
this work, we introduce a fully Eulerian finite element framework for modeling
contact between elastic solids tailored towards problems including evolving and
intricate surfaces. The proposed approach uses a phase-field method that
involves a diffuse representation of geometries on a fixed mesh, simplifying
the modeling of evolving surfaces. Our methodology introduces a novel
volumetric contact constraint based on penalty body forces, efficiently
resolving the interpenetration of solids. We showcase the validity and
versatility of our method through numerical examples, highlighting its ability
to accurately capture complex solid-solid interactions. The Eulerian
phase-field formulation greatly simplifies contact detection and its
resolution. Furthermore, the framework can be straightforwardly coupled with
other physical phenomena through the inclusion of multiple energy terms in the
evolution of the phase-field. This enables multiphysics modeling, potentially
providing a valuable tool for a wide range of applications involving chemically
or physically evolving deformable solids in contact, as they commonly occur in
deterioration processes of porous media.

Topological materials are at the forefront of quantum materials research,

Recognizing the pivotal role of sustainability in addressing global pollution,
carbon emissions, resource conservation, and ethical labor practices, we

sustainability and environmental impact. Our approach involves a hierarchical
analysis encompassing cost, toxicity, energy demands, environmental impact,
social implications, and resilience to imports. By applying this framework to

At optimal doping, different cuprate compounds can exhibit vastly different
critical temperatures for superconductivity ($T_c$), ranging from about 20 K to
about 135 K. The precise properties of the lattice that determine the magnitude
of the $T_c$ are currently unknown. In this paper, we investigate the
dependence of the optimal doping $T_c$ on the parameters of the Emery ($d-p$)
model for the CuO$_2$ planes in the cuprates. We show that the best scaling is
obtained not with the parameters of the model written in the real
($d/p$-orbital) space, but rather written in the space of effective Wannier
orbitals. In this basis, one obtains a model of three sublattices coupled
through all possible 4-point interactions. We identify multiple predictor
variables that fit the experimental $T_c$ to about $\pm4$ K and that depend on
the coupling constants in the transformed Hamiltonian.

The charge transport has been analyzed theoretically across a T-shaped and
series-configured double quantum dots Josephson junction by implementing the
Slave Boson mean field approximation at an infinite-U limit. It has been shown
that Andreev Bound states (ABS) and Josephson current can be tuned by varying
the interdot tunneling (t) and quantum dots energy level. For the T-shape
configuration of the quantum dots, an extra path is available for the transport
of electrons which causes the interference destruction between two paths. For
decoupled quantum dots with $\epsilon_{d1}=\epsilon_{d2}=0$, the energy of ABS
crosses at $\omega=0$ and Josephson current shows a discontinuity at $\phi=\pm
\pi$. On the other hand, for coupled quantum dots the lower and upper ABS has a
finite spacing, the Josephson current exhibits sinusoidal nature and its
magnitude suppresses with increasing interdot tunneling strength. While in the
series configuration, with increment in t, Josephson current increases and
shows a discontinuity at $\phi=\pm \pi$, once the system gets resonant
tunneling for $t=0.5\Gamma$ with $\epsilon_{d1}=\epsilon_{d2}=0.5\Gamma$.
Further, we also analyze the nature of the energy of ABS and Josephson current
with the quantum dots energy level in both configurations.

<h3>Two Kinetically Different Supercooled Liquids -- Potential Energy  Landscape Perspective</h3>

During the process of rapid cooling, two distinct types of supercooled
liquids are found. One kind of supercooled liquids destines to crystallize (the
crystal-forming liquid (GFL)), and the other forms a glass (the glass-forming
liquid (GFL)). Despite having no significant differences in conventional
physical quantities such as structure and energy, the distribution of the
potential energy after short-time averaging reveals the emergence of
distinction. By analyzing the skewness of the potential energy distribution
after the short-time average, a new characteristic time ($\Delta_{CTS)}$)
emerges. For a given temperature, the skewness reaches an extremum when the
duration of the short-time average equals this characteristic time.
Interestingly, this characteristic time scale follows a Curie-like law
($\Delta_{CTS}\sim 1/(T-T^{*})^{{\gamma}}$) with an exponent $\gamma$, which
effectively distinguishes these two types of supercooled liquids. The value of
$\gamma$ undergoes a discontinuous transition at the critical cooling rate. The
value of $\gamma_{g}$, corresponding to GFL, is always greater than
$\gamma_{c}$ associated with CFL. Remarkably, $T^{*}$ precisely represents the
glass transition temperature (Tg ) or the crystallization temperature (Tc ) for
GFL and CFL, respectively. Theoretical analysis suggests that, the Curie-like
law implies a kinetic phase transition. The essential difference between these
two types of supercooled liquids lies in the different in local potential
energy landscapes. First, the atomic motion in GFL may have more strong
correlation than that in CFL. Second, CFL may possess a lower configurational
entropy than GFL. The current study not only delineates the differentiation
between the two types of supercooled liquids, but also provides a new
perspective for exploring the nature of glasses.

Odd viscosity (OV) is a transport coefficient in, for example, fluids of
self-spinning (active) particles or electrons in an external magnetic field.
The key feature of OV is that it does not contribute to dissipation in two
spatial dimensions. In contrast, we explicitly show that in the
three-dimensional case, OV can contribute indirectly to dissipation by
modifying the fluid flow. We quantify the dissipation rate of a single
spherical particle moving through a fluid with OV via an exact analytical
solution of the generalised stationary creeping flow equations. Our results
provide a novel way to quantify the effects of OV by measuring the solid-body
motion of a single spherical particle. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate how
complex fluids can be designed in terms of their rheological properties by
mixing passive particles with self-spinning active particles.

Engineering surfaces and interfaces of materials promises great potential in
the field of heterostructures and quantum matter designer, with the opportunity
of driving new many-body phases that are absent in the bulk compounds. Here, we
focus on the magnetic Weyl kagome system Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ and show how for
different sample's terminations the Weyl-points connect also differently, still
preserving the bulk-boundary correspondence. Scanning-tunnelling microscopy has
suggested such a scenario indirectly. Here, we demonstrate this directly for
the fermiology of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, by linking it to the system real space
surfaces distribution. By a combination of micro-ARPES and first-principles
calculations, we measure the energy-momentum spectra and the Fermi surfaces of
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ for different surface terminations and show the existence of
topological features directly depending on the top-layer electronic
environment. Our work helps to define a route to control bulk-derived
topological properties by means of surface electrostatic potentials, creating a
realistic and reliable methodology to use Weyl kagome metals in responsive
magnetic spintronics.

The topology of the electronic band structure of solids can be described by
its Berry curvature distribution across the Brillouin zone. We theoretically
introduce and experimentally demonstrate a general methodology based on the
measurement of energy- and momentum-resolved optical transition rates, allowing
to reveal signatures of Berry curvature texture in reciprocal space. By
performing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of atomically
thin WSe$_2$ using polarization-modulated excitations, we demonstrate that
excitons become an asset in extracting the quantum geometrical properties of
solids. We also investigate the resilience of our measurement protocol against
ultrafast scattering processes following direct chiroptical transitions.

The spin Hall (SH) effect, the conversion of the electric current to the spin
current along the transverse direction, relies on the relativistic spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). Here, we develop microscopic mechanisms of the SH effect in
magnetic metals, where itinerant electrons are coupled with localized magnetic
moments via the Hund exchange interaction and the SOC. Both antiferromagnetic
metals and ferromagnetic metals are considered. It is shown that the spin Hall
conductivity can be significantly enhanced by the spin fluctuation when
approaching the magnetic transition temperature of both cases. For
antiferromagnetic metals, the pure SHE appears in entire temperature range,
while for ferromagnetic metals, the pure SHE is expected to be replaced by the
anomalous Hall effect below the transition temperature. We also discuss
possible experimental realizations and the effect of the quantum criticality
when the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is tuned to zero temperature.

The bulk photovoltaic effect is an experimentally verified phenomenon by
which a direct charge current is induced within a non-centrosymmetric material
by light illumination. Calculations of its intrinsic contribution, the shift
current, are nowadays amenable from first-principles employing plane-waves
bases. In this work we present a general method for evaluating the shift
conductivity in the framework of localized Gaussian basis sets that can be
employed in both the length and velocity gauges, carrying the idiosyncrasies of
the quantum-chemistry approach. The (possibly magnetic) symmetry of the system
is exploited in order to fold the reciprocal space summations to the
representation domain, allowing to reduce computation time and unveiling the
complete symmetry properties of the conductivity tensor under general light
polarization.

Double perovskite oxide materials have garnered tremendous interest due to
their strong spin-lattice-charge coupling. Interesting in their own right,
rare-earth-based DPOs have yet to be subjected to high-pressure studies. In
this paper, we have investigated the structural response of Nd$_2$CoFeO$_6$ to
pressure by XRD and Raman spectroscopic measurements. From XRD data, we have
observed pressure-induced structural transition from the orthorhombic phase to
the monoclinic phase at about 13.8~\si{\giga\pascal}. An anomalous increase in
compressibility at a much lower pressure($\sim$1.1~\si{\giga\pascal}) is seen
where no structural transition occurs. At about the same pressure, a sudden
drop in the slope of Raman modes is observed. Further investigation at low
temperatures reveals that the B$_g$ Raman mode is strongly affected by magnetic
interactions. Additional high-pressure Raman experiments with the application
of a magnetic field indicated that the mentioned anomaly around
1.1~\si{\giga\pascal} can be explained by a high-spin to low-spin transition of
Co$^{3+}$.

Neural-network quantum states (NQSs), variationally optimized by combining
traditional methods and deep learning techniques, is a new way to find quantum
many-body ground states and gradually becomes a competitor of traditional
variational methods. However, there are still some difficulties in the
optimization of NQSs, such as local minima, slow convergence, and sign
structure optimization. Here, we split a quantum many-body variational wave
function into a multiplication of a real-valued amplitude neural network and a
sign structure, and focus on the optimization of the amplitude network while
keeping the sign structure fixed. The amplitude network is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with residual blocks, namely a ResNet. Our method is
tested on three typical quantum many-body systems. The obtained ground state
energies are lower than or comparable to those from traditional variational
Monte Carlo (VMC) methods and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).
Surprisingly, for the frustrated Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model, our results are
better than those of the complex-valued CNN in the literature, implying that
the sign structure of the complex-valued NQS is difficult to be optimized. We
will study the optimization of the sign structure of NQSs in the future.

Sintering is an important processing step in both ceramics and metals
processing. The microstructure resulting from this process determines many
materials properties of interest. Hence the accurate prediction of the
microstructure, depending on processing and materials parameters, is of great
importance. The phase-field method offers a way of predicting this
microstructural evolution on a mesoscopic scale. The present paper employs this
method to investigate concurrent densification and grain growth and the
influence of stress on densification. Furthermore, the method is applied to
simulate the entire freeze-casting process chain for the first time ever by
simulating the freezing and sintering processes separately and passing the
frozen microstructure to the present sintering model.

<h3>Topological Elasticity in Physical Gels with Limited Valence</h3>

Understanding the connection between a material's microscopic network
topology and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental open challenge across
a wide range of physical systems. Here, we investigate the elasticity of DNA
nanostar hydrogels - a model system for networks with limited valence - by
coupling rheology measurements, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics
simulations. We discover that these networks display a large degree of
interpenetration and that loops within the network are topologically linked,
forming a percolating network-within-network structure. Strikingly, we discover
that the onset of topological links between shortest loops fully determines the
elasticity of these physical gels. We thus argue that the elasticity of limited
valence gels is not dictated by their fractal microstructure, but by the
topology of looped motifs. Our findings highlight the emergence of "topological
elasticity" as a previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming
liquids and physical gels and will inspire the design of
topologically-controllable material behaviours.

The exploration of nontrivial transport phenomena associated with the
interplay between magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), particularly in
van der Waals (vdW) systems has gained a resurgence of interest due to their
easy exfoliation, ideal for two-dimensional (2D) spintronics. We report the
near room temperature quasi-2D ferromagnet, Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ from the iron-based
vdW family (Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$, $n$=3,4,5), exhibiting a large anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC), $\sigma^A_{xy}$ $\sim$ 490 $\Omega^{-1}\textrm{cm}^{-1}$ at
2 K. The near quadratic behavior of anomalous Hall resistivity
($\rho^{A}_{xy}$) with the longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) suggests that
a dominant AHC contribution is coming from an intrinsic Berry curvature (BC)
mechanism. Concomitantly, the electronic structure calculations reveal a large
BC arising from SOC induced gaped nodal lines around the Fermi level, governing
such large AHC property. Moreover, we also report an exceptionally large
anomalous Hall angle ($\simeq$ 10.6\%) and Hall factor ($\simeq$ 0.22 V$^{-1}$)
values which so far, are the largest in compared to those for other members in
this vdW family.

We investigate the moir\'e band structures and the strong correlation effects
in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ for a wide range of twist angles, employing a
combination of various techniques. Using large-scale first principles
calculations, we pinpoint realistic continuum modeling parameters, subsequently
deriving the maximally localized Wannier functions for the top three moir\'e
bands. Simplifying our model with reasonable assumptions, we obtain a minimal
two-band model, encompassing Coulomb repulsion, correlated hopping, and spin
exchange. Our minimal interaction models pave the way for further exploration
of the rich many-body physics in twisted MoTe$_2$. Furthermore, we explore the
phase diagrams of the system through Hartree-Fock approximation and exact
diagonalization. Our two-band exact diagonalization analysis underscores
significant band-mixing effects in this system, which enlarge the optimal twist
angle for fractional quantum anomalous Hall states.

<h3>Correlation Effects and Concomitant Two-Orbital $s_\pm$-Wave  Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under High Pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
Possible high-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC) has been found experimentally in
the bilayer material La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure recently, in which
the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are expected to play a key
role in the electronic structure and the SC. Here we study the two-orbital
electron correlations and the nature of the SC using the bilayer two-orbital
Hubbard model downfolded from the band structure of La3Ni2O7 in the framework
of the dynamical mean-field theory. We find that each of the two orbitals forms
$s_\pm$-wave SC pairing. Because of the nonlocal inter-orbital hoppings, the
two-orbital SCs are concomitant and they transition to Mott insulating states
simultaneously when tuning the system to half filling. The Hund's coupling
induced local inter-orbital spin coupling enhances the electron correlations
pronouncedly and is crucial to the SC.

<h3>Optical conductivity of tilted higher pseudospin Dirac-Weyl cones</h3>

We investigate the finite-frequency optical response of systems described at
low energies by Dirac-Weyl Hamiltonians with higher pseudospin $\mathcal{S}$
values. In particular, we examine the situation where a tilting term is applied
in the Hamiltonian, which results in tilting of the Dirac electronic band
structure. We calculate and discuss the optical conductivity for the cases
$\mathcal{S}=1$, $3/2$, and $2$, in both two and three dimensions in order to
demonstrate the expected signatures in the optical response. We examine both
undertilted (type I) and overtilted (type II) as well as the critically-tilted
case (type III). Along with the well-known case of $\mathcal{S} =1/2$, a
pattern emerges for any $\mathcal{S}$. We note that in situations with multiple
nested cones, such as happens for $\mathcal{S}>1$, the possibility of having
one cone being type I while the other is type II allows for more rich
variations in the optical signature, which we will label as type IV behavior.
We also comment on the presence of optical sum rules in the presence of
tilting. Finally, we discuss tilting in the $\alpha$-T$_3$ model in two
dimensions, which is a hybrid of the $\mathcal{S}=1/2$ (honeycomb lattice) and
$\mathcal{S}=1$ (dice or T$_3$ lattice) model with a variable Berry's phase. We
contrast this model's conductivity with that of $\mathcal{S}=3/2$ and
$\mathcal{S}=2$ as the resultant optical response has some similarities,
although there are clear distinguishing features between the these cases.

<h3>Non-Abelian quantum Hall states in multi-layer rhombohedral stacked  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09702" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09702</a>

<br>

It is known that $n$-degenerate Landau levels with the same spin-valley
quantum number can be realized by $n$-layer graphene with rhombohedral stacking
under magnetic field $B$. We find that the wave functions of degenerate Landau
levels are concentrated at the surface layers of the multi-layer graphene if
the dimensionless ratio $\eta = \gamma_1/(v_F\sqrt{2e\hbar B/c}) \approx 9/
\sqrt{B[\text{Tesla}]} \gg 1$, where $\gamma_1$ is the interlayer hopping
energy and $v_F$ the Fermi velocity of single-layer graphene. This allows us to
suggest that: 1) filling fraction $\nu=\frac12$ (or $\nu_n = 5\frac12$)
non-Abelian state with Ising anyon can be realized in three-layer graphene for
magnetic field $ B \lesssim 9$ Tesla; 2) filling fraction $\nu=\frac23$ (or
$\nu_n = 7\frac13$) non-Abelian state with Fibonacci anyon can be realized in
four-layer graphene for magnetic field $ B \sim 2 - 9 $ Tesla. Here, $\nu$ is
the total filling fraction in the degenerate Landau levels, and $\nu_n$ is the
filling fraction measured from charge neutrality point which determines the
measured Hall conductance. We have assumed the following conditions to obtain
the above results: the exchange effective of Coulomb interaction polarizes the
$SU(4)$ spin-valley quantum number and effective dielectric constant $\epsilon
\gtrsim 10$ to reduce the Coulomb interaction. The high density of states of
multi-layer graphene helps to reduce the Coulomb interaction via screening.

Magic-angle helical trilayer graphene relaxes into commensurate moir\'e
domains, whose topological and well-isolated set of narrow bands possess ideal
characteristics for realizing robust correlated topological phases, compared
with other graphene-based moir\'e heterostructures. Combining strong-coupling
analysis and Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate the ground states at
integer fillings $\nu$, and uncover a rich phase diagram of correlated
insulators tuned by an external displacement field $D$. For small $D$, the
system realizes several competing families of symmetry-broken generalized
flavor ferromagnets, which exhibit various anomalous Hall signatures and Chern
numbers as high as $|C|=6$. The interaction-induced dispersion renormalization
is weak, so that the band flatness and the validity of strong-coupling theory
are maintained at all integer fillings. For experimentally accessible
displacement fields, the strong-coupling insulators at all $\nu$ undergo
topological phase transitions, which appear continuous or weakly first-order.
For larger $D$, we also find translation symmetry-broken phases such as
Kekul\'e spiral order. Our results demonstrate the robust capability of helical
trilayer graphene to host gate-tunable topological and symmetry-broken
correlated phases, and lay the groundwork for future theoretical studies on
other aspects such as fractional topological states.

Semiconductor moir\'e superlattices provide a highly tunable platform to
study the interplay between electron correlation and band topology. For
example, the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model can be simulated by the
topological moir\'e flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides
homobilayers. For this system, we obtain the filling factor, twist angle, and
electric field-dependent quantum phase diagrams with a plethora of phases,
including the quantum spin Hall insulator, the in-plane antiferromagnetic
state, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic Chern insulator, the spin-polarized
Chern insulator, the in-plane ferromagnetic state, and the 120$^\circ$
antiferromagnetic state. We predict that a gate-defined junction formed between
the quantum spin Hall insulator phase with proximitized superconductivity and
magnetic phases with in-plane magnetization (either ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic) can realize one-dimensional topological superconductor with
Majorana zero modes. Our proposal introduces semiconductor moir\'e homobilayers
as an electrically tunable Majorana platform with no need of an external
magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
We investigate quantum phase transitions in the transverse field Ising chain
with algebraically decaying long-range antiferromagnetic interactions by using
the variational Monte Carlo method with the restricted Boltzmann machine being
employed as a trial wave function ansatz. In the finite-size scaling analysis
with the order parameter and the second R\'enyi entropy, we find that the
central charge deviates from 1/2 at a small decay exponent $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$
in contrast to the critical exponents staying very close to the short-range
(SR) Ising values regardless of $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$ examined, supporting the
previously proposed scenario of conformal invariance breakdown. To identify the
threshold of the Ising universality and the conformal symmetry, we perform two
additional tests for the universal Binder ratio and the conformal field theory
(CFT) description of the correlation function. It turns out that both indicate
a noticeable deviation from the SR Ising class at $\alpha_\mathrm{LR} < 2$.
However, a closer look at the scaled correlation function for
$\alpha_\mathrm{LR} \ge 2$ shows a gradual change from the asymptotic line of
the CFT verified at $\alpha_\mathrm{LR} = 3$, providing a rough estimate of the
threshold being in the range of $2 \lesssim \alpha_\mathrm{LR} < 3$.
