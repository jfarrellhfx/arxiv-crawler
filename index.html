Superfluidity in Fermi systems is not destroyed by a flow exceeding the
Landau velocity threshold. The overcritical state acquires normal component
even at zero temperature. We explore peculiar hydrodynamics of this system and
discover two sound modes, for which the explicit universal dispersion relations

<h3>Poles of hydrodynamic spectral functions and Einstein-Helfand formulas  for transport coefficients</h3>

<br>
<br>
The local-equilibrium approach to transport processes is related to the
approach based on time-dependent correlation functions and their associated
spectral functions characterizing the equilibrium fluctuations of particle,
momentum and other densities. On the one hand, the transport coefficients are
calculated with the Einstein-Helfand formulas derived in the local-equilibrium
approach. On the other hand, the poles of the spectral functions at complex
frequencies give the damping rates of the hydrodynamic modes. Since these rates
also depend on the transport coefficients, their values can be compared to the
predictions of the local-equilibrium approach. This comparison is
systematically carried out for the hard-sphere fluid by computing numerically
the transport coefficients, the spectral functions, and their poles as a
function of the wave number in the hydrodynamic limit. The study shows the
consistency between the two approaches for the determination of the transport
properties.

<h3>Microscopic theory for hyperuniformity in two-dimensional chiral active  fluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06298" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06298</a>

<i>Yuta Kuroda, Kunimasa Miyazaki</i>
<br>
<br>
Some nonequilibrium systems exhibit anomalous suppression of the large-scale
density fluctuations, so-called hyperuniformity. Recently, hyperuniformity was
found numerically in a simple model of chiral active fluids [Q.-L. Lei et al.,
Sci. Adv. 5, eaau7423 (2019)]. We revisit this phenomenon and put forward a
microscopic theory to explain it. An effective fluctuating hydrodynamic
equation is derived for a simple particle model of chiral active matter. We
demonstrate that the linear analysis of the obtained hydrodynamic equation
captures the hyperuniformity. Our theory yields hyperuniformity characterized
by the same exponents as the numerical observation, but the agreement with the
numerical data is qualitative. We also argue that the hydrodynamic equation for
the effective particle representation, in which each rotating trajectory is
regarded as an effective particle, has the same form as the macroscopic
description of the random organization model with the center of mass
conservation.

<h3>Nagaoka ferromagnetism in doped Hubbard models in optical lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05683</a>
<br>
<i>Rhine Samajdar, R. N. Bhatt</i>
<br>
<br>
The search for ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has been a problem of
outstanding interest since Nagaoka's original proposal in 1966. Recent advances
in quantum simulation have today enabled the study of tunable doped Hubbard
models in ultracold atomic systems. Here, we examine a realistic variant of
such a model wherein any second electron on a single lattice site is weakly
bound compared to the first one. Employing large-scale density-matrix
renormalization group calculations, we establish the existence of high-spin
ground states on square and triangular lattices, analyze the microscopic
mechanisms behind their origin, and investigate the interplay between
ferromagnetism and other competing orders, such as stripes. Our results also
explain$\unicode{x2014}$and shed new light on$\unicode{x2014}$the intriguing
observations of ferromagnetic correlations in recent optical-lattice
experiments.

<h3>Second Dome of Superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ at High Pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05715</a>
<br>
<i>Johannes Nokelainen, Matthew E. Matzelle, Christopher Lane, Nabil Atlam, Ruiqi Zhang, Robert S. Markiewicz, Bernardo Barbiellini, Jianwei Sun, Arun Bansil</i>
<br>
<br>
Evidence is growing that a second dome of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$
superconductivity can be accessed in the cuprates by increasing the doping
beyond the first dome. Here we use \emph{ab initio} methods without invoking
any free parameters such as the Hubbard $U$, to reveal that pressure could turn
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ into an ideal candidate for second-dome-superconductivity,
displaying the predicted signature of strongly hybridized $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Notably, pressure is found to induce a phase transition
replacing the antiferromagnetic phases with an orbitally-degenerate $d$-$d$
phase. We find an interesting doping-dependence of the oxygen-hole fraction in
the CuO$_2$ planes, which suggests the presence of a second dome.

<h3>Reciprocal space temperature-dependent phonons method from ab-initio  dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Ibrahim Buba Garba, Tommaso Morresi, Charles Bouillaguet, Michele Casula, Lorenzo Paulatto</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a robust reciprocal-space implementation of the
temperature-dependent effective potential method. Our implementation can scale
easily to large cell and long sampling time. It is interoperable with standard
ab-initio molecular dynamics and with Langevin dynamics. We prove that both
sampling methods can be efficient and accurate if a thermostat is used to
control temperature and dynamics parameters are used to optimize the sampling
efficiency. By way of example, we apply it to study anharmonic phonon
renormalization in weakly and strongly anharmonic materials, reproducing the
temperature effect on phonon frequencies, crossing of phase transition, and
stabilization of high-temperature phases.

<h3>Imaging and structure analysis of ferroelectric domains, domain walls,  and vortices by scanning electron diffraction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Direct electron detectors in scanning transmission electron microscopy give
unprecedented possibilities for structure analysis at the nanoscale. In
electronic and quantum materials, this new capability gives access to, for
example, emergent chiral structures and symmetry-breaking distortions that
underpin functional properties. Quantifying nanoscale structural features with
statistical significance, however, is complicated by the subtleties of dynamic
diffraction and coexisting contrast mechanisms, which often results in low
signal-to-noise and the superposition of multiple signals that are challenging
to deconvolute. Here we apply scanning electron diffraction to explore local
polar distortions in the uniaxial ferroelectric Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$. Using a
custom-designed convolutional autoencoder with bespoke regularization, we
demonstrate that subtle variations in the scattering signatures of
ferroelectric domains, domain walls, and vortex textures can readily be
disentangled with statistical significance and separated from extrinsic
contributions due to, e.g., variations in specimen thickness or bending. The
work demonstrates a pathway to quantitatively measure symmetry-breaking
distortions across large areas, mapping structural changes at interfaces and
topological structures with nanoscale spatial resolution.

<h3>Interaction of $\langle a \rangle$ prismatic screw dislocations with the  $α-β$ interface side face in $α-β$ Ti alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05737" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05737</a>
<br>
<i>Ali Rida, Satish I. Rao, Jaafar A. El-Awady</i>
<br>
<br>
Slip transmission across $\alpha-\beta$ interfaces is of great significance
in understanding the strength of $\alpha-\beta$ Ti alloys for aerospace
applications. Molecular statics (MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
were conducted to investigate the mechanisms of slip transmission of $\langle a
\rangle$ prismatic screw dislocations across the $\alpha-\beta$ interface side
face. In these simulations, the $\alpha$ phase consisted of pure HCP Ti whereas
the $\beta$ phase was modeled as Ti$_{60}$Nb$_{40}$ BCC random alloy using a
Ti-Nb interatomic potential. Firstly, the misfit dislocations structure on the
$\alpha-\beta$ interface side face has been characterized from MS simulations.
This predicted dislocation structure is in good agreement with experimental
observations in Ti-alloys. Secondly, MD simulations of the interaction of
$[a_1]$, $[a_2]$, and $[a_3]$ prismatic screw dislocations with the interface
side face in an $\alpha-\beta$ bi-crystal were performed at different
temperatures. A distinct barrier of the interface side face to different types
of dislocation transmission was found. The origin of this anisotropy in the
slip transmission is due to the relative misalignment of the slip systems
between the $\alpha$ and the $\beta$ phases from the Burgers orientation
relationship. Finally, the mechanisms of slip transmission of each dislocation
type were analyzed in a detailed atomistic description and compared to
experimental observations.

<h3>Noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional Weyl semimetals in porous Si/Ge  structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05756" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05756</a>
<br>
<i>Emmanuel V. C. Lopes, Rogerio J. Baierle, Roberto H. Miwa, Tome M. Schmidt</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we predict a family of noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional (2D)
Weyl semimetals composed by porous Ge and SiGe structures. These systems are
energetically stable graphenylene-like structures with a buckling,
spontaneously breaking the inversion symmetry. The nontrivial topological phase
for these 2D systems occurs just below the Fermi level, resulting in
nonvanishing Berry curvature around the Weyl nodes. The emerged Weyl semimetals
are protected by $C_3$ symmetry, presenting one-dimensional edge Fermi-arcs
connecting Weyl points with opposite chiralities. Our findings complete the
family of Weyl in condensed-matter physics, by predicting the first
noncentrosymmetric class of 2D Weyl semimetals.

<h3>Fusion Surface Models: 2+1d Lattice Models from Fusion 2-Categories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05774</a>
<br>
<i>Kansei Inamura, Kantaro Ohmori</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct (2+1)-dimensional lattice systems, which we call fusion surface
models. These models have finite non-invertible symmetries described by general
fusion 2-categories. Our method can be applied to build microscopic models
with, for example, anomalous or non-anomalous one-form symmetries, 2-group
symmetries, or non-invertible one-form symmetries that capture non-abelian
anyon statistics. The construction of these models generalizes the construction
of the 1+1d anyon chains formalized by Aasen, Fendley, and Mong. Along with the
fusion surface models, we also obtain the corresponding three-dimensional
classical statistical models, which are 3d analogues of the 2d
Aasen-Fendley-Mong height models. In the construction, the "symmetry TFTs" for
fusion 2-category symmetries play an important role.

<h3>Robust negative longitudinal magnetoresistance and spin-orbit torque in  sputtered Pt3Sn topological semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05801" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05801</a>

<br>
<br>
Contrary to topological insulators, topological semimetals possess a
nontrivial chiral anomaly that leads to negative magnetoresistance and are
hosts to both conductive bulk states and topological surface states with
intriguing transport properties for spintronics. Here, we fabricate
highly-ordered metallic Pt3Sn and Pt3SnxFe1-x thin films via sputtering
technology. Systematic angular dependence (both in-plane and out-of-plane)
study of magnetoresistance presents surprisingly robust quadratic and linear
negative longitudinal magnetoresistance features for Pt3Sn and Pt3SnxFe1-x,
respectively. We attribute the anomalous negative longitudinal
magnetoresistance to the type-II Dirac semimetal phase (pristine Pt3Sn) and/or
the formation of tunable Weyl semimetal phases through symmetry breaking
processes, such as magnetic-atom doping, as confirmed by first-principles
calculations. Furthermore, Pt3Sn and Pt3SnxFe1-x show the promising performance
for facilitating the development of advanced spin-orbit torque devices. These
results extend our understanding of chiral anomaly of topological semimetals
and can pave the way for exploring novel topological materials for spintronic
devices.

<h3>Quantum Fokker-Planck structure of the Lindblad equation</h3>

<br>
<i>Mário J. de Oliveira</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the quantum Fokker-Planck equation, obtained by a canonical
quantization of its classical version, can be transformed into an equation of
the Lindblad form. This result allows us to conclude that the quantum
Fokker-Planck equation preserves the trace and positivity of the density
operator. The Fokker-Planck structure gives explicit expression for the quantum
equivalence of probability current as well as the quantum equivalence of
detailed balance. We also propose expression for the rate of entropy production
and show that it does not vanish for a closed system except in equilibrium.

<h3>Inverse orbital Hall effect and orbitronic terahertz emission observed  in the materials with weak spin-orbit coupling</h3>

<i>Ping Wang, Zheng Feng, Yuhe Yang, Delin Zhang, Quancheng Liu, Zedong Xu, Zhiyan Jia, Yong Wu, Guoqiang Yu, Xiaoguang Xu, Yong Jiang</i>
<br>
<br>
The Orbital Hall effect, which originates from materials with weak spin-orbit
coupling, has attracted considerable interest for spin-orbitronic applications.
Here, we demonstrate the inverse effect of the orbital Hall effect and observe
orbitronic terahertz emission in the Ti and Mn materials. Through spin-orbit
transition in the ferromagnetic layer, the generated orbital current can be
converted to charge current in the Ti and Mn layers via the inverse orbital
Hall effect. Furthermore, the inserted W layer provides an additional
conversion of the orbital-charge current in the Ti and Mn layers, significantly
enhancing the orbitronic terahertz emission. Moreover, the orbitronic terahertz
emission can be manipulated by cooperating with the inverse orbital Hall effect
and the inverse spin Hall effect in the different sample configurations. Our
results not only discover the physical mechanism of condensed matter physics
but also pave the way for designing promising spin-orbitronic devices and
terahertz emitters.

<h3>Quartet Superfluid in Two-component Fermions with Mass Imbalance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05831" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05831</a>
<br>
<i>Ruijin Liu, Wei Wang, Xiaoling Cui</i>
<br>
<br>
Quartet superfluid (QSF) is a distinct type of fermion superfluidity that
features high-order correlation beyond the conventional BCS pairing paradigm.
However, such state is hard to produce and its studies so far rely on stringent
conditions such as multi-components and/or multi-body interactions. Here we
report the emergent QSF in mass-imbalanced two-component fermions with simple
two-body (contact) interactions. This is facilitated by the formation of
tetramer bound state in vacuum (a quartet) consisting of a light atom and three
heavy fermions. We have constructed a variational ansatz to describe QSF as the
quartet condensation in heavy-light mixtures with number ratio $3:1$. In a
considerable range of mass imbalance and 2D coupling strength, QSF is found to
be the ground state as compared to all other phases involving pairing
superfluid and trimer liquid. Moreover, the unique high-order correlation in
QSF is shown to manifest itself in the momentum-space crystallization of
pairing field and density-density distribution of heavy fermions. Such QSF and
its characteristic correlations can be readily probed in a number of
Fermi-Fermi mixtures now realized in cold atoms laboratories.

<h3>Vibronic effect on resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of cubic iridium  hexahalides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05853</a>
<br>
<i>Naoya Iwahara, Wataru Furukawa</i>
<br>
<br>
Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of K$_2$IrCl$_6$ show a splitting
of the $j=3/2$ states resembling non-cubic crystal-field splitting although the
compound is cubic down to 0.3 K. Here we theoretically describe the RIXS
spectra based on the interplay of the spin-orbit interaction and the dynamic
Jahn-Teller effect. We found that the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in the $j=3/2$
multiplet states gives rise to the splitting of the RIXS spectra and the
broadening of the spectra in raising the temperature. With the same approach,
we could quantitatively reproduce the difference in the gap between the peaks
of K$_2$IrCl$_6$ and K$_2$IrBr$_6$. We also showed that the interaction
parameters used for the simulations agree well with our {\it ab initio}
coupling parameters. Our results suggest that, in the excited $j=3/2$ multiplet
of K$_2$IrCl$_6$, the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect develops and keeps the
compound cubic.

<h3>Electron doping induced stable ferromagnetism in two-dimensional GdI_3  monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05872" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05872</a>
<br>
<i>Rong Guo, Yilv Guo, Yehui Zhang, Xiaoshu Gong, Tingbo Zhang, Xing Yu, Shijun Yuan, Jinlan Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
As a two-dimensional material with a hollow hexatomic ring structure,
N\'eel-type anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) GdI3 can be used as a theoretical model to
study the effect of electron doping. Based on first-principles calculations, we
find that the Fermi surface nesting occurs when more than 1/3 electron per Gd
is doped, resulting in the failure to obtain a stable ferromagnetic (FM) state.
More interestingly, GdI3 with appropriate Mg/Ca doping (1/6 Mg/Ca per Gd) turns
to be half-metallic FM state. This AFM-FM transition results from the transfer
of doped electrons to the spatially expanded Gd-5d orbital, which leads to the
FM coupling of local half-full Gd-4f electrons through 5d-4f hybridization.
Moreover, the shortened Gd-Gd length is the key to the formation of the stable
ferromagnetic coupling. Our method provides new insights into obtaining stable
FM materials from AFM materials.

<h3>Geometrical optics of large deviations of Brownian motion in  inhomogeneous media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05942" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05942</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Geometrical optics provides an instructive insight into Brownian motion,
``pushed" into a large-deviations regime by imposed constraints. Here we extend
geometrical optics of Brownian motion by accounting for diffusion inhomogeneity
in space. We consider three simple model problems of Brownian motion on the
line or in the plane in situations where the diffusivity of the Brownian
particle depends on one spatial coordinate. One of our results describes
``Brownian refraction": an analog of refraction of light passing through a
boundary between two media with different refraction indices.

<h3>Simultaneous depletion and adsorption in polymer solutions near a solid  wall</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05960</a>

<i>Suzanne Lafon, Tiago Outerelo-Corvo, Marion Grzelka, Arnaud Hélary, Philipp Gutfreund, Liliane Léger, Alexis Chennevière, Frédéric Restagno</i>
<br>
<br>
Polymer solutions exhibit peculiar properties near surfaces: polymer chains
either adsorb onto or can be repelled by the wall. Only a few techniques are
able to probe their structure in the vicinity of solid substrates, because of
the small length scales over which liquids are influenced by the wall. In this
paper, we use neutron reflectivity measurements at the interface between a
polystyrene semidilute solution in a good solvent and a smooth sapphire
surface. We show that polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid
surface, but contrary to what is generally assumed, this does not prevent some
chains to still adsorb on the wall. We also observe that the Newtonian flow of
the solution has a negligible effect on the size of the depletion layer, which
is a hypothesis often made but rarely measured in the literature.

<h3>Multi-Hill Strategy in Metadynamics for Interstitial Diffusion in  Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05978" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05978</a>
<br>
<i>Kazuaki Toyoura</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an efficient and general strategy of metadynamics (MetaD) for
investigating interstitial diffusion in a crystal by exploiting
crystallographic symmetry. Assuming complete ignorance of the diffusion
phenomenon of interest, the three-dimensional coordinates of the interstitial
atom with the periodic boundaries are chosen as the collective variables (CVs).
Multiple potential hills are simultaneously deposited at all
crystallographically-equivalent positions on the free energy surface (FES)
defined in the CV space. As a result, the proposed multi-hill strategy highly
accelerates atomic jumps in comparison with the single-hill strategy in the
conventional MetaD. The key features are that the FES estimated from the final
bias potential is exactly satisfied with the symmetry of the host crystal and
that all elementary processes of interstitial diffusion are obtained by the
single MetaD simulation without any prior knowledge on the diffusion mechanism.
The high efficiency and efficacy of the multi-hill strategy are demonstrated,
taking the proton diffusion in barium zirconate with the cubic perovskite
structure as a model case.

<h3>Wave function and spatial structure of polarons in an antiferromagnetic  bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05980" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05980</a>
<br>
<i>Jens H. Nyhegn, Georg M. Bruun, Kristian K. Nielsen</i>
<br>
<br>
Adding a dopant to an antiferromagnetic spin background disturbs the magnetic
order and leads to the formation of a quasiparticle coined the magnetic
polaron, which plays a central role in understanding strongly correlated
materials. Recently, remarkably detailed insights into the spatial properties
of such polarons have been obtained using atoms in optical lattices. Motivated
by this we develop a non-perturbative scheme for calculating the wave function
of the magnetic polaron in a bilayer antiferromagnet using the self-consistent
Born approximation. The scheme includes an infinite number of spin waves, which
is crucial for an accurate description of the most interesting regime of strong
correlations. Utilizing the developed wave function, we explore the spatial
structure of the polaron dressing cloud consisting of magnetically frustrated
spins surrounding the hole. Mimicking the non-monotonic behavior of the
antiferromagnetic order, we find that the dressing cloud first decreases and
then increases in size with increasing interlayer hopping. The increase
reflects the decrease in the magnetic order as a quantum phase transition to a
disordered state is approached for large interlayer hopping. We, furthermore,
find that the symmetry of the ground state dressing cloud changes as the
interlayer coupling increases. Our results should be experimentally accessible
using quantum simulation with optical lattices.

<h3>Competition between lanes and transient jammed clusters in driven binary  mixtures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05990" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05990</a>
<br>
<i>Honghao Yu, Robert L. Jack</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider mixtures of oppositely driven particles, showing that their
non-equilibrium steady states form lanes parallel to the drive, which coexist
with transient jammed clusters where particles are temporarily immobilised. We
analyse the interplay between these two types of non-equilibrium pattern
formation, including their implications for macroscopic demixing perpendicular
to the drive. Finite-size scaling analysis indicates that there is no critical
driving force associated with demixing, which appears as a crossover in finite
systems. We attribute this effect to the disruption of long-ranged order by the
transient jammed clusters.

<br>
<br>
The local ordering of alloys directly influences their electronic and optical
properties. In this work, the atomic arrangement in optoelectronic-grade GeSn
epitaxial layers featuring a Sn content in the 5-14% range is investigated. By
using polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory
calculations, different local environments for Ge atoms, induced by the Sn
atoms and their corresponding distortion of the atomic bond, are identified,
giving rise to two spectral features at different energies. Furthermore, all
the other observed vibrational modes are associated with a combination of Ge
and Sn displacement. This analysis provides a valuable framework for advancing
the understanding of the vibrational properties in (Si)GeSn alloys,
particularly with regard to the impact of local ordering of the different
atomic species.

<h3>Correlations of spin splitting and orbital fluctuations due to 1/f  charge noise in the Si/SiGe Quantum Dot</h3>

Fluctuations of electric fields can change the position of a gate-defined
quantum dot in a semiconductor heterostructure. In the presence of magnetic
field gradient, these stochastic shifts of electron's wavefunction lead to
fluctuations of electron's spin splitting. The resulting spin dephasing due to
charge noise limits the coherence times of spin qubits in isotopically purified
Si/SiGe quantum dots. We investigate the spin splitting noise caused by such
process caused by microscopic motion of charges at the semiconductor-oxide
interface. We compare effects of isotropic and planar displacement of the
charges, and estimate their densities and typical displacement magnitudes that
can reproduce experimentally observed spin splitting noise spectra. We predict
that for defect density of $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, visible correlations between
noises in spin splitting and in energy of electron's ground state in the
quantum dot, are expected.

<br>
<br>
We study theoretically the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states
appearing locally in a superconducting thin film with a small circular magnetic
cluster. The pair potential, the pairing correlations, the free-energy density,
and the quasiparticle density of states are calculated for several cluster
sizes and the exchange potentials by solving the Eilenberger equation in two
dimensions. The number of nodes in the pair potential increases with increasing
the exchange potential and cluster size. The local FFLO states are stabilized
by the superconducting condensate away from the magnetic cluster even though
the free-energy density beneath the ferromagnet exceeds locally the
normal-state value. The analysis of the pairing-correlation functions shows
that the spatial variation of the spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential
generates $p$-wave Cooper pairs, and that odd-frequency Cooper pairs govern the
inhomogeneous subgap spectra in the local density of states. We also discuss a
way of detecting the local FFLO states based on the calculated quasiparticle
density of states.

<br>
<br>
We analyze theoretically the origin of the spin Nernst and thermal Hall
effects in FePS3 as a realization of two-dimensional antiferromagnet (2D AFM).
We find that a strong magnetoelastic coupling, hybridizing magnetic excitation
(magnon) and elastic excitation (phonon), combined with
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, results in a Berry curvature hotspots in the
region of anticrossing between the two distinct hybridized bands. Furthermore,
large spin Berry curvature emerges due to interband transitions between two
magnon-like bands, where a small energy gap is induced by magnetoelastic
coupling between such bands that are energetically distant from anticrossing of
hybridized bands. These nonzero Berry curvatures generate topological
transverse transport (i.e., the thermal Hall effect) of hybrid excitations,
dubbed magnon-polaron, as well as of spin (i.e., the spin Nernst effect)
carried by them, in response to applied longitudinal temperature gradient. We
investigate the dependence of the spin Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities
on the applied magnetic field and temperature, unveiling very large spin Nernst
conductivity even at zero magnetic field. Our results suggest FePS3 AFM, which
is already available in 2D form experimentally, as a promising platform to
explore the topological transport of the magnon-polaron quasiparticles at THz
frequencies.

Using a nonperturbative classical model for ionic motion through
one-dimensional (1D) solids, we explore how thermal lattice vibrations affect
ionic transport properties. Based on analytic and numerical calculations, we
find that the mean dissipation experienced by the mobile ion is similar to that
of the non-thermal case, with thermal motion only contributing stochastic
noise. A nonmonotonic dependence of drag on speed, predicted in earlier work,
persists in the presence of thermal motion. The inverse relation between drag
and speed at high speeds results in non-Fickian diffusion dominated by L\'{e}vy
flights. This suppression of drag at high speeds, combined with enhanced
activation frequency, improves the particle mobility at high temperatures,
where typical particles move faster.

Polymers confined in corrugated channels, i.e. channels of of varying
amplitude, display, upon increasing their degree of polymerization $N$, a
non-monotonic behavior in the diffusion coefficient. We propose a theoretical
effective free energy for linear polymers based on a Fick-Jacobs approach. We
validate the predictions against numerical data, obtaining quantitative
agreement for different observables. Finally, we employ the effective free
energy to compute the polymer lengths $N_{min}$ at which the diffusion
coefficient presents a minimum: we find a scaling expression that we
rationalize with a blob model. Our results could be useful to design porous
adsorbers, that separate polymers of different sizes without the action of an
external flow.

We study if the interplay between dynamical localization and interactions in
periodically driven quantum systems can give rise to anomalous thermalization
behavior. Specifically, we consider one-dimensional models with interacting
spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor hopping and density-density
interactions, and a periodically driven on-site potential with spatial
periodicity $\boldsymbol{m=2}$ and $\boldsymbol{m=4}$. At a dynamical
localization point, these models evade thermalization either due to the
presence of an extensive number of conserved quantities (for weak interactions)
or due to the kinetic constraints caused by drive-induced resonances (for
strong interactions). Our models therefore illustrate interesting mechanisms
for generating constrained dynamics in Floquet systems which are difficult to
realize in an undriven system.

Viscous flows are laminar and deterministic. Robust linear laws accurately
predict their streamlines in structures as complex as blood vessels, porous
media and pipe networks. However, biological and synthetic active fluids defy
these fundamental laws. Irrespective of their microscopic origin, confined
active flows are intrinsically bistable, and therefore non-linear. As a
consequence, their emergent patterns in channel networks are out of reach of
available theories, and lack quantitative experiments. Here, we lay out the
basic laws of active hydraulics. We show that active hydraulic flows are
non-deterministic and yield degenerate streamline patterns ruled by frustration
at nodes with an odd coordination number. More precisely, colloidal-roller
experiments in trivalent networks reveal how active-hydraulic flows realize
dynamical spin ices. The resulting streamline patterns split into two distinct
classes of self-similar loops, which reflect the fractionalization of
topological defects at the subchannel scales. Informed by our measurements, we
formulate the laws of active hydraulics as a double spin model. A series of
mappings on loop O(n) models then allow us to exactly predict the geometry of
the degenerate streamlines. We expect our fundamental understanding to provide
robust design rules for active microfluidic devices, and to offer unanticipated
avenues to understand the motion of living cells and organisms in complex
habitats.

Superconducting properties of thin films can be vastly different from those
of bulk materials. Seminal work has shown the critical temperature Tc of
elemental superconductors decreases with decreasing film thickness when the
normal-state sheet resistance is lower than the quantum resistance h/(4e2).
Sporadic examples on disordered films, however, hinted an enhancement in Tc
although, structural and strain characterization was not possible since samples
were prepared on a cold substrate in situ. To clarify the role of reduced
dimensionality and disorder on the superconducting properties of thin films we
employed molecular beam epitaxy to grow wafer-scale high-quality aluminum (Al)
nanofilms with normal-state sheet resistance at least 20 times lower than
h/(4e2) and investigated their electronic and structural properties ex situ.
Defying general expectations, Tc increases with decreasing Al film thickness,
reaching 2.4 K for 3.5-nm-thick Al film grown on GaAs: twice that of bulk Al
(1.2 K). DFT calculations indicate surface phonon softening impacts
superconductivity in pure ultra-thin films, offering a new route for materials
engineering in two dimensions.

boarder. This behavior is totally unexpected within simple scenario of sub-gate

The pressure-induced color change in the nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride has
triggered extensive discussions about the underlying physics. Here, we study
the optical response of LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$ in a broad frequency range at
ambient pressure and its evolution with pressure in the visible spectral range.
The broad-band optical spectra at ambient pressure reveal a Drude component
associated with intra-band electronic transitions and two Lorentz components
(L1 and L2) arising from inter-band electronic transitions. The application of
pressure causes a spectral weight transfer from L1 to the Drude component,
leading to a blue shift of the plasma edge in the reflectivity spectrum
alongside a reduction of the high-frequency reflectivity. Our results suggest
that the pressure-induced color change in LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$ is closely
related to the transformation between intra- and inter-band electronic
transitions, providing new insights into the mechanism of the pressure-induced
color change in LuH$_{2 \pm x}$N$_{y}$.

Multiferroic tunnel junctions (MFTJs) based on two-dimensional (2D) van der
Waals heterostructures with sharp and clean interfaces at the atomic scale are
crucial for applications in nanoscale multi-resistive logic memory devices. The
recently discovered sliding ferroelectricity in 2D van der Waals materials has
opened new avenues for ferroelectric-based devices. Here, we theoretically
investigate the spin-dependent electronic transport properties of
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/graphene/bilayer-$h$-BN/graphene/CrI$_3$ (FGT/Gr-BBN-Gr/CrI)
all-vdW MFTJs by employing the nonequilibrium Green's function combined with
density functional theory. We demonstrate that such FGT/Gr-BBN-Gr/CrI MFTJs
exhibit four non-volatile resistance states associated with different staking
orders of sliding ferroelectric BBN and magnetization alignment of
ferromagnetic free layer CrI$_3$, with a maximum tunnel magnetoresistance
(electroresistance) ratio, i.e., TMR (TER) up to $\sim$$3.36\times10^{4}$\%
($\sim$$6.68\times10^{3}$\%) at a specific bias voltage. Furthermore, the
perfect spin filtering and remarkable negative differential resistance effects
are evident in our MFTJs. We further discover that the TMR, TER, and spin
polarization ratio under an equilibrium state can be enhanced by the
application of in-plane biaxial strain. This work shows that the giant
tunneling resistance ratio, multiple resistance states, and excellent
spin-polarized transport properties of sliding ferroelectric BBN-based MFTJs
indicate its significant potential in nonvolatile memories.

We consider the kinetics of the imperfect narrow escape problem, i.e. the
time it takes for a particle diffusing in a confined medium of generic shape to
reach and to be adsorbed by a small, imperfectly reactive patch embedded in the
boundary of the domain, in two or three dimensions. Imperfect reactivity is
modeled by an intrinsic surface reactivity $\kappa$ of the patch, giving rise
to Robin boundary conditions. We present a formalism to calculate the exact
asymptotics of the mean reaction time in the limit of large volume of the
confining domain. We obtain exact explicit results in the two limits of large
and small reactivities of the reactive patch, and a semi-analytical expression
in the general case. Our approach reveals an anomalous scaling of the mean
reaction time as the inverse square root of the reactivity in the large
reactivity limit, valid for an initial position near the extremity of the
reactive patch. We compare our exact results with those obtained within the
``constant flux approximation''; we show that this approximation turns out to
give exactly the next-to-leading order term of the small reactivity limit, and
provides a good approximation of the reaction time far from the reactive patch
for all reactivities, but not in the vicinity of the boundary of the reactive
patch due to the above mentioned anomalous scaling. These results thus provide
a general framework to quantify the mean reaction times for the imperfect
narrow escape problem.

We report the observation of an unexpected quadratic temperature dependence
of the heat capacity in the vanadium sulphide metal V5S8 at low temperatures
which is independent of applied magnetic field. We find that the behaviour of
the heat capacity is consistent with an unconventional phonon spectrum which is
linear in wavevector in the c direction but quadratic in the a-b plane,
indicating a form of geometrical elastic criticality. In the case of V5S8 we
also observe an unusual intermediate transition at high magnetic fields between
the expected spin-flop and spin-flip transitions. We demonstrate that the
intermediate field-induced transition is in agreement with a model of two
sublattices with frustrated inter- and intra-sublattice spin couplings.

<h3>Anchoring-mediated stick-slip winding of cholesteric liquid crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
The stick-slip phenomenon widely exists in contact mechanics, from the
macroscale to the nanoscale. During cholesteric-nematic unwinding by external
fields, there is controversy regarding the role of planar surface anchoring,
which may induce discontinuous stick-slip behaviors despite the well-known
continuous transitions observed in past experiments. Here, we observe three
regimes, namely constrained, stick-slip, and sliding-slip, under mechanical
winding with different anchoring conditions, and measure the responded forces
by the Surface Force Balance. These behaviors result from a balance of
cholesteric elastic torque and surface torque, reminiscent of the slip
morphology on frictional substrates [T. G. Sano et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118,
178001 (2017)], and provide evidence of dynamics in static rotational friction.

<br>
<br>
Permeative flows, known for the explanation of the anomalous viscosity (10^5
Poise) in cholesterics at low shear rates, are still under debate due to the
difficulty of experiments. Here we use the Surface Force Balance, in which
uniform domains with regular circular defects are formed, to probe the forces
generated by compression in the direction of the helical axis. At the
quasi-static speed of the surface approach, the measured forces are shown to be
elastic (not dissipative), arising from the twist elastic deformation when the
planar anchoring at the walls is strong. A mechanism involving frictional
surface torque under strong planar surface anchoring will be proposed. The
results indicate that the strong resistance to flow observed, previously
interpreted as an enormous apparent viscosity, may in fact originate from the
intrinsic non-linear increase of elasticity when the molecules are rotated away
from equilibrium. The system is found to store energy (the force is
reversible), without dissipation, as long as the applied stress is below the
threshold for nucleating new defects. Our study underpins the importance of
boundary conditions that may dramatically change the rheology of other
viscoelastic materials and sheds light on the rational design of
strain-stiffening materials, nanomotors, and artificial muscles involving
helical architectures.

<i>Weichao Zheng</i>
<br>
<br>
Structural superlubricity, one of the most important concepts in modern
tribology, has attracted lots of interest in both fundamental research and
practical applications. However, despite promising theoretical models, such as
the Prandtl-Tomlinson and Frenkel-Kontorova models, and great success in
structural lubricant experiments with two-dimensional materials and colloids,
these models have not been directly tested. Here, with the cholesteric liquid
crystals confined under the Surface Force Balance, we measure the surface
torque during rotational friction, and the molecular rotation from the
commensurate to incommensurate configuration, at the onset of structural
lubricity. Furthermore, by changing the surface potential, the Aubry transition
is confirmed. The results agree well with the description by a modified
three-dimensional version of the above models and provide molecular evidence
for rupture nucleation during static friction. Our study bridges the gap
between theories and experiments, and reinforces the connection between
friction and fracture.

We study the coherent dynamic interaction of a time-dependent spin-splitting
field with the homogeneous superconducting order parameter $\Delta(t)$ mediated
by spin-orbit coupling using the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory. In
the first part of the work we show that linear response of the superconductor
is strongly affected by the Zeeman field and spin-flip processes, giving rise
to multiple resonant frequencies of the superconducting Higgs modes. These
modes can be excited either by a quench, or by an additional non-stationary
component of the spin-splitting field, which couples linearly to the Higgs
modes. In the second part, we analyze the nonadiabatic dynamics of
quasiparticle states arising from the intersection of spectral branches from
different spin subbands, which can be provoked by a linearly growing Zeeman
field. We provide insights into the dependence of the order parameter
$\Delta(t)$ on this field and interference effects caused by tunneling of
states at the avoided crossing points. We also show that since the nonadiabatic
tunneling is related to spin-flip processes, the quasiparticle gas experiences
a dynamic magnetization that contributes to its spin susceptibility.

Considerable attention has been devoted to microscopic heat engines in both
theoretical and experimental aspects. Notably, fundamental limits pertaining to
power and efficiency have been intensively studied, as well as trade-off
relations between these two quantities. This Letter aims to shed further light
on the ultimate limits of heat engines by exploring the relationship between
the geometric length along the path of cyclic heat engines operating at
arbitrary speeds and their power and efficiency. We reveal that the power of a
heat engine is always upper bounded by the product of its geometric length and
the statistics of energy. This finding implies that increasing both the energy
gap and the energy fluctuation is necessary for achieving high power output.
Moreover, we establish a trade-off relation between power and efficiency using
the geometric length and the timescale of the heat engine. Our results provide
a comprehensive framework for the performance of cyclic heat engines and are
universally applicable to both classical and quantum heat engines driven far
from equilibrium.

Dynamical quantum phase transitions occur in dynamically evolving quantum
systems when non-analyticities occur at critical times in the return rate, a
dynamical analogue of the free energy. This extension of the concept of phase
transitions can be brought into contact with another, namely that of
topological phase transitions in which the phase transition is marked by a
change in a topological invariant. Following a quantum quench dynamical quantum
phase transitions can happen in topological matter, a fact which has already
been explored in one dimensional topological insulators and in two dimensional
Chern insulators. Additionally in one dimensional systems a dynamical bulk
boundary correspondence has been seen, related to the periodic appearance of
zero modes of the Loschmidt echo itself. Here we extend both of these concepts
to two dimensional higher order topological matter, in which the topologically
protected boundary modes are corner modes. We consider a minimal model which
encompasses all possible forms of higher order topology in two dimensional
topological band structures. We find that DQPTs can still occur, and can occur
for quenches which cross both bulk and boundary gap closings. Furthermore a
dynamical bulk boundary correspondence is also found, which takes a different
form to that in one dimension.

<h3>Eigenmodes of magnetic skyrmion lattices</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We explore the interplay between topology and eigenmodes by changing the
stabilizing mechanism of skyrmion lattices (skX). We focus on two prototypical
ultrathin films hosting an hexagonal (Pd/Fe/Ir(111)) and a square (Fe/Ir(111))
skyrmion lattice, which can both be described by an extended Heisenberg
Hamiltonian. We first examine whether the Dzyaloshinkskii-Moriya, or the
exchange interaction as the leading energy term affects the modes of the
hexagonal skX of Pd/Fe/Ir(111). In all cases, we find that the lowest frequency
modes correspond to internal degrees of freedom of individual skyrmions, and
suggest a classification based on azimuthal and radial numbers $(l,p)$, with up
to $l=6$, and $p=2$. We also show that the gyration behavior induced by an
in-plane field corresponds to the excitation of $l=1$ deformation modes with
varying radial numbers. Second, we examine the square lattice of skyrmions of
Fe/Ir(111). Its stabilization mechanism is dominated by the 4-spin interaction.
After relaxation, the unit cell does not carry a topological charge, and the
eigenmodes do not correspond to internal skyrmion deformations. By reducing the
4-spin interaction, the integer topological charge is recovered, but the charge
carriers do not possess internal degrees of freedom, nor are they separated by
energy barriers. We conclude that a 4-spin dominated Hamiltonian does not yield
skyrmion lattice solutions, and that therefore, a nontrivial topology does not
imply the existence of skyrmions.

Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry were
used to study the role of the dynamics of biomolecules decoupled from solvent
effects. Lyophilised sucrose exhibited steadily increasing absorption with
temperature as anharmonic excitations commence as the system emerges from a
deep minimum of the potential energy landscape where harmonic vibrations
dominate. The polypeptide bacitracin and two globular proteins, lysozyme and
human serum albumin, showed a more complex temperature dependence. Further
analysis focused on the spectral signature below and above the boson peak. We
found evidence for the onset of anharmonic motions that are characteristic for
partial unfolding and molecular jamming in the dry biomolecules. The activation
of modes of the protein molecules at temperatures comparable to the protein
dynamical transition temperature was observed in the absence of hydration. No
evidence for Fr\"ohlich coherence, postulated to facilitate biological
function, was found in our experiments.

The use of a complex ferromagnetic system to manipulate GHz surface acoustic
waves is a rich current topic under investigation, but the high-power nonlinear
regime is under-explored. We introduce focused surface acoustic waves, which
provide a way to access this regime with modest equipment. Symmetry of the
magneto-acoustic interaction can be tuned by interdigitated transducer design
which can introduce additional strain components. Here, we compare the impact
of focused acoustic waves versus standard unidirectional acoustic waves in
significantly enhancing the magnon-phonon coupling behavior. Analytical
simulation results based on modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory show good
agreement with experimental findings. We also report nonlinear input power
dependence of the transmission through the device. This experimental
observation is supported by the micromagnetic simulation using mumax3 to model
the nonlinear dependence. These results pave the way for extending the
understanding and design of acoustic wave devices for exploration of
acoustically driven spin wave resonance physics.

Analyzing phase transitions using the inherent geometrical attributes of a
system has garnered enormous interest over the past few decades. The usual
candidate often used for investigation is graphene -- the most celebrated
material among the family of tri co-ordinated graphed lattices. We show in this
report that other inhabitants of the family demonstrate equally admirable
structural and functional properties that at its core are controlled by their
topology. Two interesting members of the family are Cylooctatrene(COT) and
COT-based polymer: poly-bi-[8]-annulenylene both in one and two dimensions that
have been investigated by polymer chemists over a period of 50 years for its
possible application in batteries exploiting its conducting properties. A
single COT unit is demonstrated herein to exhibit topological solitons at sites
of a broken bond similar to an open one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
chain. We observe that Poly-bi-[8]-annulenylene in 1D mimics two coupled SSH
chains in the weak coupling limit thereby showing the presence of topological
edge modes. In the strong coupling limit, we investigate the different
parameter values of our system for which we observe zero energy modes. Further,
the application of an external magnetic field and its effects on the
band-flattening of the energy bands has also been studied. In 2D,
poly-bi-[8]-annulenylene forms a square-octagon lattice which upon breaking
time-reversal symmetry goes into a topological phase forming noise-resilient
edge modes. We hope our analysis would pave the way for synthesizing such
topological materials and exploiting their properties for promising
applications in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and renewable energy sources.

We study dipole-mode and scissors-mode oscillations of a harmonically-trapped
dipolar supersolid, composed of dipolar droplets arranged on a one-dimensional
(1D) or a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, to establish the robustness of its
crystalline structure under translation and rotation, using a beyond-mean-field
model including a Lee-Huang-Yang interaction. The dipolar atoms are polarized
along the $z$ direction with the supersolid crystalline structure lying in the
$x$-$y$ plane. A stable dipole-mode oscillation was possible in case of both
quasi-1D and quasi-2D dipolar supersolids, whereas a sustained angular
scissors-mode oscillation was possible only in the case of a quasi-1D dipolar
supersolid between a maximum and a minimum of trap anisotropy in the $x$-$y$
plane. In both cases there was no visible deformation of the crystalline
structure of the dipolar supersolid during the oscillation. The theoretical
estimate of the scissors-mode-oscillation frequency was in good agreement with
the present results and the agreement improved with an increase of the number
of droplets in the supersolid and also with an increase in the confining trap
frequencies. The results of this study can be tested experimentally with
present knowhow.

A case study of the non-equilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems in the
markovian approximation is presented for two dynamical models based on a single
harmonic oscillator in an external field. Specified through distinct forms of
ohmic damping, their quantum Langevin equations are derived from an identical
set of physical criteria, namely the canonical commutator between position and
momentum, the Kubo formula, the virial theorem and the quantum equilibrium
variance. The associated Lindblad equations are derived but only one of them is
completely positive. Transforming those into Fokker-Planck equations for the
Wigner functions, both models are shown to evolve towards the same Gibbs state,
for a vanishing external field. The phenomenological differences between the
models are illustrated through their quantum relaxations and through the phase
diagrammes derived from their re-interpretation as mean-field approximations of
an interacting many-body system.

Currently, solid interfaces composed of two-dimensional materials (2D) in
contact with metal surfaces (m-surf) have been the subject of intense research,
where the borophene bilayer (BBL) has been considered a prominent material for
the development of electronic devices based on 2D platforms. In this work, we
present a theoretical study of the energetic, structural, and electronic
properties of the BBL/m-surf interface, with m-surf = Ag, Au, and Al (111)
surfaces, and the electronic transport properties of BBL channels connected to
the BBL/m-surf top contacts. We find that the bottom-most BBL layer becomes
metalized, due to the orbital hybridization with the metal surface states,
resulting in BBL/m-surf ohmic contacts, meanwhile, the inner and top-most boron
layers kept their semiconducting character. The net charge transfers reveal
that BBL has become $n$-type ($p$-type) doped for m-surf = Ag, and Al (= Au). A
thorough structural characterization of the BBL/m-surf interface, using a
series of simulations of the X-ray photoelectron spectra, shows that the
formation of BBL/m-surf interface is characterized by a redshift of the B-$1s$
spectra. Further electronic transport results revealed the emergence of a
Schottky barrier between 0.1 and 0.2\,eV between the BBL/m-surf contact and the
BBL channels. We believe that our findings are timely, bringing important
contributions to the applicability of borophene bilayers for developing 2D
electronic devices.

A new concept in magnonics studies the dynamics of spin waves (SWs) in
three-dimensional nanosystems. It is a natural evolution from conventionally
used planar systems to explore magnetization configurations and dynamics in 3D
nanostructures with lengths near intrinsic magnetic scales. In this work, we
perform broadband ferromagnetic resonance (BBFMR) measurements and
micromagnetic simulations of nanoscale magnetic gyroids - a periodic chiral
structure consisting entirely of chiral triple junctions. Our results show
unique properties of the network, such as the localization of the SW modes,
evoking their topological properties, and the substantial sensitivity to the
direction of the static magnetic field. The presented results open a wide range
of applications in the emerging field of 3D magnonic crystals and spintronics.
