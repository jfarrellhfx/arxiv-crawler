<h3>Trapping of an active Brownian particle at a partially absorbing wall</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09105" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09105</a>

<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>

Active matter concerns the self-organization of energy consuming elements
such as motile bacteria or self-propelled colloids. A canonical example is an
active Brownian particle (ABP) that moves at constant speed while its direction
of motion undergoes rotational diffusion. When ABPs are confined within a
channel, they tend to accumulate at the channel walls, even when inter-particle
interactions are ignored. Each particle pushes on the boundary until a tumble
event reverses its direction. The wall thus acts as a sticky boundary. In this
paper we consider a natural extension of sticky boundaries that allows for a
particle to be permanently killed (absorbed) whilst attached to a wall. In
particular, we investigate the first passage time (FPT) problem for an ABP in a
two-dimensional channel where one of the walls is partially absorbing.
Calculating the exact FPT statistics requires solving a non-trivial two-way
diffusion boundary value problem (BVP). We follow a different approach by
separating out the dynamics away from the absorbing wall from the dynamics of
absorption and escape whilst attached to the wall. Using probabilistic methods,
we derive an explicit expression for the MFPT of absorption, assuming that the
arrival statistics of particles at the wall are known. Our method also allows
us to incorporate a more general encounter-based model of absorption.

<h3>Can room temperature data for tunneling molecular junctions be analyzed  within a theoretical framework assuming zero temperature?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09156" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09156</a>

Routinely, experiments on tunneling molecular junctions report values of
conductances ($G_{RT}$) and currents ($I_{RT}$) measured at room temperature.
On the other side, theoretical approaches based on simplified models provide
analytic formulas for the conductance ($G_{0K}$) and current ($I_{0K}$) valid
at zero temperature. Therefore, interrogating the applicability of the
theoretical results deduced in the zero temperature limit to real experimental
situations at room temperature i.e., $G_{RT} \approx G_{0K}$ and $I_{RT}
\approx I_{0K}$) is a relevant aspect. Quantifying the pertaining temperature
impact on the transport properties computed within the ubiquitous single level
model with Lorentzian transmission is the specific aim of the present work.
Comprehensive results are presented for broad ranges of the relevant parameters
(level's energy offset $\varepsilon_0$ and width $\Gamma_a $, and applied bias
$V$) that safely cover values characterizing currently fabricated junctions.
They demonstrate that the strongest thermal effects occur at biases below
resonance ($2 \left\vert \varepsilon_0 \right\vert - \delta\varepsilon_0 \alt
\vert e V\vert \alt 2 \left\vert \varepsilon_0 \right\vert$). At fixed $V$,
they affect an $\varepsilon_0$-range whose largest width $\delta\varepsilon_0 $
is about nine times larger than the thermal energy ($\delta\varepsilon_0
\approx 3 \pi k_B T$) at $\Gamma_a \to 0$. The numerous figures included aim at
conveying a quick overview on the applicability of the zero temperature limit
to a specific real junction. In quantitative terms, the conditions of
applicability are expressed as mathematical inequalities involving elementary
functions. They constitute the basis of an interactive data fitting procedure
proposed, which aims at guiding experimentalists interested in data processing
in a specific case.

<h3>Emergence of synchronised rotations in dense active matter with disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09439" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09439</a>

We consider the rich variety of collective motion patterns emerging when
aligning active particles move in the presence of randomly distributed
obstacles - representing quenched noise in two dimensions. In order to get
insight into the involved complex flows and the transitions between them we use
a simple model allowing the observation and analysis of behaviors that are less
straightforwardly accessible by experiments or analytic calculations. We find a
series of symmetry breaking states in spite of the applied disorder being
isotropic. In particular, as the level of perturbations is increased, the
system of self-propelled particles changes its collective motion patterns from
i) directed flow ii) through a mixed state of locally directed or locally
rotating flow to iii) a novel, globally synchronized rotating state thereby the
system violating overall chiral symmetry. Finally, this phase crosses over to a
state in which iv) clusters of locally synchronized rotations are observed. The
way of change from polar flow to overall synchronization can be interpreted as
indicating a non-reciprocal phase transition. Our simulations suggest that when
both present, quenched rather than shot noise dominates the behaviors.

<h3>Interacting semi-flexible self-avoiding walks studied on a fractal  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09530" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09530</a>
<br>
<i>Dušanka Marčetić</i>
<br>
<br>
Self-avoiding walks are studied on the 3-simplex fractal lattice as a model
of linear polymer conformations in a dilute, non-homogeneous solution. A model
is supplemented with bending energies and attractive-interaction energies
between non-consecutively visited pairs of nearest-neighboring sites
(contacts). It captures the main features of a semi-flexible polymer subjected
to variable solvent conditions. Hierarchical structure of the fractal lattice
enabled determination of the exact recurrence equations for the generating
function, through which universal and local properties of the model were
studied. Analysis of the recurrence equations showed that for all finite values
of the considered energies and non-zero temperatures, polymer resides in an
expanded phase. Critical exponents of the expanded phase are universal and the
same as those for ordinary self-avoiding walks on the same lattice found
earlier. As a measure of local properties, the mean number of contacts per mean
number of steps as well as persistence length, are calculated as functions of
Boltzmann weights associated with bending energies and attractive interactions
between contacts. Both quantities are monotonic functions of stiffness weights
for fixed interaction, and in the limit of infinite stiffness the number of
contacts decreases to zero, while the persistence length increases unboundedly.

<h3>Dynamic phase transition induced by active molecules simulating a  facilitation mechanism in a supercooled liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09675" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09675</a>
<br>
<i>Victor Teboul</i>
<br>
<br>
The purpose of this work is to use active particles to study the effect of
facilitation on supercooled liquids. To this end we investigate the behavior of
a model supercooled liquid doped with intermittently active and intermittently
slowed particles. To simulate a facilitation mechanism, the active particles
are submitted intermittently to a force following the mobility of the most
mobile molecule around, while the slowed particles are submitted to a friction
force. We observe upon activation, a fluidization of the whole medium
simultaneously to a large increase of the dynamic heterogeneity. This effect is
reminiscent of the fluidization observed with molecular motors doping of the
medium. When the mobility characteristic time used in the facilitation
mechanism matches the physical time characterizing the spontaneous mobility
aggregation of the material, we observe a phase transition associated with a
structural aggregation of active molecules. This transition is accompanied by a
sharp increase of the fluidization and dynamic heterogeneity.

<h3>Active nematics on flat surfaces: from droplet motility and scission to  active wetting</h3>

<br>
We consider the dynamics of active nematics droplets on flat surfaces, based
on the continuum hydrodynamic theory. We investigate a wide range of dynamical
regimes as a function of the activity and droplet size on surfaces
characterized by strong anchoring and a range of equilibrium contact angles.
The activity was found to control a variety of dynamical regimes, including the
self-propulsion of droplets on surfaces, scission, active wetting and droplet
evaporation. Furthermore, we found that on a given surface (characterized by
the anchoring and the equilibrium contact angle) the dynamical regimes may be
controlled by the active capillary number of suspended droplets. We also found
that the active nematics concentration of the droplets varies with the
activity, affecting the wetting behaviour weakly but ultimately driving droplet
evaporation. Our analysis provides a global description of a wide range of
dynamical regimes reported for active nematics droplets and suggests a unified
description of droplets on surfaces. We discuss the key role of the finite size
of the droplet and comment on the suppression of these regimes in the infinite
size limit, where the active nematics is turbulent at any degree of activity.

<h3>Anomalous Skin Effects in Disordered Systems with a Single non-Hermitian  Impurity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09081</a>
<br>
<i>Paolo Molignini, Oscar Arandes, Emil J. Bergholtz</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore anomalous skin effects at non-Hermitian impurities by studying
their interplay with potential disorder and by exactly solving a minimal
lattice model. A striking feature of the solvable single-impurity model is that
the presence of anisotropic hopping terms can induce a scale-invariant
accumulation of all eigenstates opposite to the bulk hopping direction,
although the non-monotonic behavior is fine-tuned and further increasing such
hopping weakens and eventually reverses the effect. The interplay with bulk
potential disorder, however, qualitatively enriches this phenomenology leading
to a robust non-monotonic localization behavior as directional hopping
strengths are tuned. These phenomena persist even in the limit of an entirely
Hermitian bulk with a single non-Hermitian impurity.

<h3>Magnetic fragmentation and fractionalized Goldstone modes in a bilayer  quantum spin liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09088" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09088</a>
<br>
<i>Aayush Vijayvargia, Emilian Marius Nica, Roderich Moessner, Yuan-Ming Lu, Onur Erten</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the phase diagram of a bilayer quantum spin liquid model with
Kitaev-type interactions on a square lattice. We show that the low energy limit
is described by a $\pi$-flux Hubbard model with an enhanced SO(4) symmetry. The
antiferromagnetic Mott transition of the Hubbard model signals a magnetic
fragmentation transition for the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the
bilayer. The fragmented "N\'eel order" features a non-local string order
parameter for an in-plane N\'eel component, in addition to an anisotropic local
order parameter. The associated quantum order is characterized by an emergent
$\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ gauge field when the N\'eel vector is
along the $\hat{z}$ direction, and a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field otherwise. We
underpin these results with a perturbative calculation, which is consistent
with the field theory analysis. We conclude with a discussion on the low energy
collective excitations of these phases and show that the Goldstone boson of the
$\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ phase is fractionalized and non-local.

<h3>A Scaling Function for the Particle Entanglement Entropy of Fermions</h3>

Entanglement entropy under a particle bipartition provides complementary
information to mode entanglement as it is sensitive to interactions and
particle statistics at leading order and does not depend on any externally
imposed length scale. In this paper, we investigate the particle entanglement
entropy in a system of $N$ interacting spinless lattice fermions in one spatial
dimension by combining bosonization techniques with exact and approximate
numerical methods. We introduce a general scaling form for the fermionic
particle entanglement entropy captured by a shape function that enters as a
extensive interaction induced correction to a known free fermion result. A
general asymptotic expansion in the total number of particles demonstrates that
its form is robust for different values of the R\'enyi index and highlights how
quantum correlations are encoded in the $n$-particle density matrix of a pure
many-body quantum state.

<h3>Measurement-induced entanglement transitions in quantum circuits of  non-interacting fermions: Born-rule versus forced measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09094</a>
<br>
<i>Chao-Ming Jian, Hassan Shapourian, Bela Bauer, Andreas W. W. Ludwig</i>
<br>
<br>
We address entanglement transitions in monitored random quantum circuits of
non-interacting fermions, in particular, the question of whether Born-rule and
forced measurements yield the same universality class. For a generic circuit
with no symmetry other than fermion parity, acting on a one-dimensional
Majorana chain, we numerically obtain several critical exponents, providing
clear evidence that the two transitions with Born-rule and forced measurements
are in different universality classes. We provide a theoretical understanding
for our numerical results by identifying the underlying statistical mechanics
model which follows from the general correspondence, established in Jian et
al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 134206, between non-unitary circuits of non-interacting
fermions and the ten-fold Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) symmetry classes. The AZ class
is the same for Born-rule and forced measurements of the circuits. For the
circuit under consideration (in AZ class DIII), the statistical mechanics model
describing the transition is the principal chiral non-linear sigma model whose
field variable is an ${\rm SO}(n)$ matrix in the replica limits $n\to 0$ and
$n\to 1$ for forced and Born-rule measurements, respectively. The former is in
an Anderson localization universality class while we show that the latter is in
a novel universality class beyond Anderson localization. Both entanglement
transitions are driven by proliferation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological defects.
The different replica limits account for the difference in the universality
classes. Furthermore, we provide numerical and symmetry-based arguments that
the entanglement transition in the previously-studied monitored circuit of
Majorana fermions based on the loop model with crossings, a highly fine-tuned
circuit, belongs to a universality class different from both transitions in the
generic circuits discussed in this paper.

<h3>Electronic nonequilibrium effect in ultrafast-laser-irradiated solids</h3>

<br>
This paper describes the effects of electronic nonequilibrium in a simulation
of ultrafast laser irradiation of materials. The simulation scheme based on
tight-binding molecular dynamics, in which the electronic populations are
traced with a combined Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation, enables the modeling
of nonequilibrium, nonthermal, and nonadiabatic (electron-phonon coupling)
effects simultaneously. The electron-electron thermalization is described
within the relaxation-time approximation, which automatically restores various
known limits such as instantaneous thermalization (the thermalization time
${\tau}_{e-e} \rightarrow 0$) and Born-Oppenheimer approximation (${\tau}_{e-e}
\rightarrow \infty$). The results of the simulation suggest that the
non-equilibrium state of the electronic system slows down electron-phonon
coupling with respect to the electronic equilibrium case in all studied
materials: metals, semiconductors, insulators. In semiconductors and
insulators, it also alters the damage threshold of ultrafast nonthermal phase
transitions induced by modification of the interatomic potential due to
electronic excitation.

<h3>Universality and the thermoelectric transport properties of a double  quantum dot system: Seeking for conditions that improve the thermoelectric  efficiency</h3>

<br>
<br>
Employing universal relations for the Onsager coefficients in the linear
regime at the symmetric point of the single impurity Anderson model, we
calculate the conditions under which the quantum scattering phase shift should
satisfy to produce the asymptotic Carnot's limit for the thermoelectric
efficiency. We show that a single quantum dot connected by metallic leads at
the Kondo regime cannot achieve the conditions that cause the best
thermoelectric efficiency. We study a system of serial double quantum dots
without inter-dot correlations. We show that maintaining one dot in the
electron-hole symmetric point makes it possible to obtain conditions for the
quantum phase shift linked to charge fluctuations in the other quantum dot that
satisfy the conditions associated with enhancing the thermoelectric efficiency.
We also discuss the presence of bound states in the continuum (BICs) and
quasi-BICs associated with the quantum scattering interference process that
improves thermoelectric efficiency. We identify two types of quasi-BICs that
occur at low and high temperatures: The first is associated with single Fano
resonances, and the last is with several Fano processes. We also discussed
possible temperature values and conditions that could be linked with the
experimental realization of our results.

<h3>Evolution of ferromagnetic stripes in FePt films at low temperature</h3>

<br>
<br>
Patterns of ferroic domains and domain walls are being intensively studied to
implement new logic schemes. Any technological application of such objects
depends on a detailed understanding of them. This study analyzes patterns of
ferromagnetic stripes on equiatomic FePt films at low temperatures. Since FePt
is known to develop a transition from in-plane homogeneous magnetization to
stripes upon varying its thickness, multiple samples are studied to consider
the critical value within the analyzed range. Stripes' width demonstrates the
well-known Murayama's law while a non-trivial dependence on temperature is also
reported. Moreover, a room-temperature uniform distribution of the pattern
evolves into a distorted one upon temperature cycling. Finally, dissimilar
stripe patterns are obtained upon reducing and increasing temperature
indicating the states are dependent on the history of applied stimuli rather
than the parametric conditions.

DNA origami is a widely used method to construct nanostructures by
self-assembling designed DNA strands. These structures are often used as
"breadboards" for templated assembly of proteins, gold nanoparticles, aptamers,
and other molecules, with applications ranging from therapeutics and
diagnostics to plasmonics and photonics. Imaging these structures using AFM or
TEM is not capable to capture their full conformation ensemble as they only
show their structure flattened on a surface. However, certain conformations of
the nanostructure can position guest molecules into distances unaccounted for
in their intended design, thus leading to spurious interactions between guest
molecules that are designed to be separated. Here, we use molecular dynamics
simulations to capture conformational ensemble of 2D DNA origami tiles and show
that introducing single-stranded overhangs, which are typically used for
functionalization of the origami with guest molecules, induces a curvature of
the tile structure in the bulk. We show that the shape deformation is of
entropic origin, with implications for design of robust DNA origami breadboards
as well as potential approach to modulate structure shape by introducing
overhangs.

<h3>Density dependence of elastic properties of graphynes</h3>

Graphyne is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope of graphene. Its structure is
composed of aromatic rings and/or carbon-carbon bonds connected by one or more
acetylene chains. As some graphynes present the most of the excellent
properties of graphene and non-null bandgap, they have been extensively
studied. Recently, Kanegae and Fonseca reported calculations of four elastic
properties of 70 graphynes, ten members of the seven families of graphynes
[Carbon Trends 7, 100152 (2022)]. They showed that the acetylene chain length
dependence of these properties can be simply modelled by a serial association
of springs. Here, based on those results, we present the density dependence of
these properties and show that the elastic moduli, $E$, of graphyne are less
dependent on density, $\rho$, than porous cellular materials with an exponent
of $E \sim \rho^{n}$, smaller than 2. We discuss the results in terms of the
shape of the pores of the graphyne structures.

<h3>Rapid Design of Top-Performing Metal-Organic Frameworks with Qualitative  Representations of Building Blocks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09184" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09184</a>

Data-driven materials design often encounters challenges where systems
require or possess qualitative (categorical) information. Metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) are an example of such material systems. The representation
of MOFs through different building blocks makes it a challenge for designers to
incorporate qualitative information into design optimization. Furthermore, the
large number of potential building blocks leads to a combinatorial challenge,
with millions of possible MOFs that could be explored through time consuming
physics-based approaches. In this work, we integrated Latent Variable Gaussian
Process (LVGP) and Multi-Objective Batch-Bayesian Optimization (MOBBO) to
identify top-performing MOFs adaptively, autonomously, and efficiently without
any human intervention. Our approach provides three main advantages: (i) no
specific physical descriptors are required and only building blocks that
construct the MOFs are used in global optimization through qualitative
representations, (ii) the method is application and property independent, and
(iii) the latent variable approach provides an interpretable model of
qualitative building blocks with physical justification. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, we considered a design space with more than 47,000
MOF candidates. By searching only ~1% of the design space, LVGP-MOBBO was able
to identify all MOFs on the Pareto front and more than 97% of the 50
top-performing designs for the CO$_2$ working capacity and CO$_2$/N$_2$
selectivity properties. Finally, we compared our approach with the Random
Forest algorithm and demonstrated its efficiency, interpretability, and
robustness.

Hybrid functional calculations are presented for defects in LiGaO$_2$ with
the fraction of non-local exchange adjusted to reproduce the recently reported
exciton gap of 6.0 eV. We study how the defect transition levels of the main
native defects change with respect to the band edges compared to earlier
calculations which assumed a smaller band gap near 5.1 eV. In addition, we
consider defect complexes formed by combining the main native donor
Ga$_\mathrm{Li}$ with the main acceptors, $V_\mathrm{Li}$ and Li$_\mathrm{Ga}$
antisites as function of their relative position. These results are used to
tentatively identify the photoluminescence bands previous assigned to
donor-acceptor-pair recombination.

<h3>Giant twist-angle dependence of thermal conductivity in bilayer graphene  originating from strong interlayer coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09213</a>
<br>
<i>H. F. Feng, B. Liu, Zhi-Xin Guo</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, the twist-angle effect on 2D van der Walls (vdW) materials, such as
bilayer graphene, has attracted great attention. Many novel electronic,
magnetic and even optical properties induced by such effect have been
discovered. However, the twist-angle effect on phononic property is not so
remarkable. By investigating the thermal conductivity of twist bilayer graphene
(TBG), here we reveal that the trivial twist-angle effect on phononic property
observed in previous studies is owing to the non-localization nature of
phonons. This characteristic makes phonons hardly trapped by the weak
interlayer potentials induced by the twist-angle dependent Moir\'e pattern. We
propose that the twist-angle effect can be effectively enhanced by increasing
the interface coupling. In use of a sandwich structure composed of h-BN and
TBG, we demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of TBG can be either
significantly increased or dramatically decreased, under the synergistic
modulation of interlayer coupling strength and twist angle. Particularly, the
twist-angle effect can lead to a nontrivial reduction of thermal conductivity
up to 78% when a strong interlayer coupling is applied. The reduction is
several times larger than that observed in the freestanding TBG where the
reduction is attributed to the twist-angle dependent phonon scatterings induced
by the edge phonons. The underlying mechanism for the giant twist-angle
dependence of thermal conductivity is further revealed on the basis of phonon
transport theory. Our findings provide a platform for achieving efficient
twist-angle modulation on phonon transport property of vdW materials.

Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac bands and flat bands are characteristics of a
kagome lattice. However, experimental studies on their electrical transport are
few, because three-dimensional (3D) bulk bands of kagome materials, consisting
of stacked 2D kagome layers, dominate the transport. We report a
magnetoresistance (MR) study of a kagome material, Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. Based on
analysis of the temperature, magnetic field, and field angle dependence of the
resistivity, we obtain a complete anatomy of MR. Besides a magnon MR, a
chirality-dependent MR, and a chiral-anomaly-induced MR, the most intriguing
feature is an orbital MR that scales only with the out-of-plane field, which
strongly indicates its 2D nature. We attribute it to the Dirac band of the

We introduce a simplified model of magnetic friction, and investigate its
behavior using both numerical and analytical methods. When resistance
coefficient $\gamma$ is large, the movement of the system obeys the thermally
activated process. In contrast, when $\gamma$ is sufficiently small, the slip
and stick states behave as separate metastable states, and the lattice velocity
depends on the probability that the slip state appears. We evaluate the
velocities in both cases using several approximations and compare the results
with those of numerical simulations.

<br>
The electronic structure of various (001), (110), and (111)B surfaces of
n-type InSb were studied with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.
The InSb(111)B (3x1) surface reconstruction is determined to be a disordered
(111)B (3x3) surface reconstruction. The surface Fermi-level of the In rich and
the equal In:Sb (001), (110), and (111)B surface reconstructions was observed
to be pinned near the valence band edge. This observed pinning is consistent
with a charge neutrality level lying near the valence band maximum. Sb
termination was observed to shift the surface Fermi-level position by up to
$254 \pm 35$ meV towards the conduction band on the InSb (001) surface and $60
\pm 35$ meV towards the conduction band on the InSb(111)B surface. The surface
Sb on the (001) can shift the surface from electron depletion to electron
accumulation. We propose the shift in the Fermi-level pinning is due to charge
transfer from Sb clusters on the Sb terminated surfaces. Additionally, many
sub-gap states were observed for the (111)B (3x1) surface, which are attributed
to the disordered nature of this surface. This work demonstrates the tuning of
the Fermi-level pinning position of InSb surfaces with Sb termination.

<br>
<br>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique for imaging
atomic structure and inferring information on local elemental composition,
chemical bonding, and electronic excitations. However, traditional methods of
visual inspection can be challenging for such determination in multi-component
alloys, particularly beyond the dilute limit due to chemical disorder and
electronic inhomogeneity. One viable solution is to use machine learning to
analyze STM data and identify patterns and correlations that may not be
immediately apparent through visual inspection alone. Here, we apply this
approach to determine the Se/S concentration in superconducting single-layer
FeSe1-xSx alloy epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(100) substrate by molecular beam
epitaxy. First, defect-related dI/dV tunneling spectra are identified by the
K-means clustering method, followed by singular value decomposition to
distinguish between those from S and Se. Such analysis provides an efficient
and reliable determination of local elemental composition, and further reveals
correlations of nanoscale chemical inhomogeneity to superconductivity in
single-layer iron chalcogenide films.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate a new focused ion beam sample preparation method for atom
probe tomography. The key aspect of the new method is that we use a neon ion
beam for the final tip shaping after conventional annulus milling using gallium
ions. This dual-ion approach combines the benefits of the faster milling
capability of the higher current gallium ion beam with the chemically inert and
higher precision milling capability of the noble gas neon ion beam. Using a
titanium-aluminum alloy and a layered aluminum/aluminum oxide material as test
cases, we show that atom probe tips prepared using the combined gallium and
neon ion approach are free from the gallium contamination that typically
frustrates composition analysis of these materials due to implantation,
diffusion, and embrittlement effects. We propose that by using a focused ion
beam from a noble gas species, such as the neon ions demonstrated here, atom
probe tomography can be more reliably performed on a larger range of materials
than is currently possible using conventional techniques.

<br>
<br>
In this work we provide a first principles description of the electronic and
optical properties of bilayers C$_3$N, with different stacking motifs AB, AB$'$
and AA$'$. Starting from quasi-particle electronic band-structures, we solve
the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE) to access the excitonic properties of these
bilayers. For all stacking sequences, we see strong optical absorption at
energies lower than but close to that of the monolayer. Most relevant, we
predict a strong quenching of the low-energy optical absorption, with
negligible oscillator strength of low-lying bound excitons. This is a unique
phenomenology that does not arise in the monolayer case, nor in other common
homo-bilayers. We explain these findings in terms of the small interband dipole
matrix elements associated to the valence-conduction transitions involved in
these excitons, and discuss them in view of the different stacking motifs.

<br>
<br>
Electronic states within superconducting vortices hold crucial information
about paring mechanisms and topology. While scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy(STM/S) can image the vortices, it is difficult to
isolate the intrinsic electronic states from extrinsic effects like subsurface
defects and disorders. We combine STM/S with unsupervised machine learning to
develop a method for screening out the vortices pinned by embedded disorder in
Fe-based superconductors. The approach provides an unbiased way to reveal
intrinsic vortex-core states and may address puzzles on Majorana zero modes.

We analyze functionals that characterize the distribution of eigenstates in
Fock space through a tool derived from algebraic topology: persistent homology.
Drawing on recent generalizations of the localization landscape applicable to
mid-spectrum eigenstates, we introduce several novel persistent homology
observables in the context of many-body localization that exhibit transitional
behavior near the critical point. We demonstrate that the persistent homology
approach to localization landscapes and, in general, functionals on the Fock
space lattice offer insights into the structure of eigenstates unobtainable by
traditional means.

<h3>Towards a quasiphase transition in the single-file chain of water  molecules: Simple lattice model</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, X.Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 027402 (2017)] have suggested
that water molecules encapsulated in (6,5) single-wall carbon nanotube
experience a temperature-induced quasiphase transition around 150 K interpreted
as changes in the water dipoles orientation. We discuss further this
temperature-driven quasiphase transition performing quantum chemical
calculations and molecular dynamics simulations and, most importantly,
suggesting a simple lattice model to reproduce the properties of the
one-dimensionally confined finite arrays of water molecules. The lattice model
takes into account not only the short-range and long-range interactions but
also the rotations in a narrow tube and the both ingredients provide an
explanation for a temperature-driven orientational ordering of the water
molecules, which persists within a relatively wide temperature range.

<h3>Comparing zero-parameter theories for the WCA and harmonic-repulsive  melting lines</h3>

<br>
<br>
The melting line of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) system was recently
determined accurately and compared to the predictions of four analytical
hard-sphere approximations [Attia et al., J. Chem. Phys. 157, 034502 (2022)].
Here, we study an alternative zero-parameter prediction based on the isomorph
theory, the input of which relate to properties at a single reference state
point on the melting line. The two central assumptions made are that the
harmonic-repulsive potential approximates the WCA potential and that pair
collisions are uncorrelated. The new approach gives excellent predictions at
high temperatures, while the hard-sphere-theory based predictions are better at
lower temperatures. Supplementing the WCA investigation, the
face-centered-crystal to fluid coexistence line is determined for a system of
harmonic-repulsive particles and compared to the zero-parameter theories. The
results indicate that the excellent isomorph-theory predictions for the WCA
potential at higher temperatures may be partly due to a cancellation of errors
between the two above-mentioned assumptions.

<h3>Intrinsically disordered protein's coil-to-globule transition and  adsorption onto a hydrophobic surface at different temperatures and pressures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or proteins with intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs) can modulate the cellular response to external
changes by coil-to-globule transition and liquid-liquid phase separation. Here
we consider a model that explicitly accounts for the water contribution to the
proteins' conformational changes at different thermodynamic conditions. By
performing Monte Carlo free-energy calculations of an IDP near a surface, both
hydrophobic, we study the protein's adsorption and structural response to
thermodynamic changes. We find that the hydrophobic interface increases the
IDP's propensity to unfold and induces adsorption in both the coil and globule
conformations. We show that the hydration water regulates this process as a
function of the thermodynamic state point. These results could be relevant for
understanding the protein structural stability when forming a biomolecular
corona around nanoparticles or the IDPs' and IDRs' responses to crowders and
thermodynamic or mechanical stresses.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we present {\ae}net-PyTorch, a PyTorch-based implementation for
training artificial neural network-based machine learning interatomic
potentials. Developed as an extension of the atomic energy network ({\ae}net),
{\ae}net-PyTorch provides access to all the tools included in {\ae}net for the
application and usage of the potentials. The package has been designed as an
alternative to the internal training capabilities of {\ae}net, leveraging the
power of graphic processing units to facilitate direct training on forces in
addition to energies. This leads to a substantial reduction of the training
time by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the CPU implementation,
enabling direct training on forces for systems beyond small molecules. Here we
demonstrate the main features of {\ae}net-PyTorch and show its performance on
open databases. Our results show that training on all the force information
within a data set is not necessary, and including between 10% to 20% of the
force information is sufficient to achieve optimally accurate interatomic
potentials with the least computational resources.

We propose a circuit-level model combining the Marcus-Hush-Chidsey electron

When a quantum dot is attached to a metallic reservoir and a superconducting
contact Andreev processes leads to a finite subgap current at the normal lead
and the creation or destruction of Cooper pairs. Andreev-reflection engines
profit from the destruction of Cooper pairs to provide the work needed to set a
charge current at the normal-conductor contact generating electrical power. For
this power-transduction device high power and large efficiencies in
quantum-mechanically enhanced regimes are demonstrated. There thermodynamic
trade-off relations between power, efficiency and stability, valid for any
classical engine are overcome, and kinetic constraints on the engine precision
are largely surpassed in arbitrary far from equilibrium conditions.

We report the nature of magnetic structure, microscopic spin-spin
correlations and their dependence on the underlying crystal structure of the
geometrically frustrated layered spin-3/2 maple-leaf-lattice (MLL)
antiferromagnet Na2Mn3O7 by a comprehensive neutron diffraction study. Crystal
structural studies by x-ray and neutron diffractions reveal that the MLL layers
(constituted by Mn3O72- units) are well separated by non-magnetic Na layers.
The studies also conclude the presence of stacking faults (in-plane sliding of
magnetic MLL layers) as well as a distortion in the MLL of Mn4+. Temperature
dependent magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron diffraction data
yield a short-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below ~ 100 K without a
long-range magnetic ordering down to 1.5 K. The analysis of the diffuse
magnetic neutron scattering patterns by reverse Monte Carlo method reveals 2D
spin-spin correlations within the MLL layers. Additionally, we establish a
relation between the correlation length of the short-range magnetic ordering
with the stacking faults through a varying synthesis condition. The present
study, therefore, explores a microscopic picture of the crystal- and
spin-structures, as well as their correlation, hence, provides an experimental
insight of the magnetic ordering in a MLL AFM. Further, we have outlined the
formation of several 2D frustrated lattice geometry having triangular
plaquettes, including the MLL, by crystal engineering of the triangular lattice
and their role on the stabilization of multiple novel chiral spin states which
opens up a door for study of novel chiral spin states.

<br>
The most promising solid electrolytes for all-solid-state Li batteries are
oxide and sulfide ceramics. Current ceramic solid electrolytes are brittle and
lack the toughness to withstand the mechanical stresses of repeated charge and
discharge cycles. Solid electrolytes are susceptible to crack propagation due
to dendrite growth from Li metal anodes and to debonding processes at the
cathode/electrolyte interface due to cyclic variations in the cathode lattice
parameters. In this perspective, we argue that solutions to the mechanics
challenges of all-solid-state batteries can be borrowed from the aerospace
industry, which successfully overcame similar hurdles in the development of
thermal barrier coatings of superalloy turbine blades. Their solution was to
exploit ferroelastic and transformation toughening mechanisms to develop
ceramics that can withstand cyclic stresses due to large variations in
temperature. This perspective describes fundamental materials design principles
with which to search for solid electrolytes that are ferroelastically
toughened.

Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, in Two-Dimensional Hybrid Organic
Inorganic Perovskites (2D HOIPs) are capable of forming hybrid light-matter
states known as exciton-polaritons (E-Ps) when the excitonic medium is confined
in an optical cavity. In the case of 2D HOIPs, they can self-hybridize into
E-Ps at specific thicknesses of the HOIP crystals that form a resonant optical
cavity with the excitons. However, the fundamental properties of these
self-hybridized E-Ps in 2D HOIPs, including their role in ultrafast energy
and/or charge transfer at interfaces, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that
> 0.5 um thick 2D HOIP crystals on Au substrates are capable of supporting
multiple-orders of self-hybridized E-P modes. These E-Ps have high Q factors (>
100) and modulate the optical dispersion for the crystal to enhance sub-gap
absorption and emission. Through varying excitation energy and ultrafast
measurements, we also confirm energy transfer from higher energy upper E-Ps to
lower energy, lower E-Ps. Finally, we also demonstrate that E-Ps are capable of
charge transport and transfer at interfaces. Our findings provide new insights
into charge and energy transfer in E-Ps opening new opportunities towards their
manipulation for polaritonic devices.

Mesoscale simulations of woven composites using parameterized analytical
geometries offer a way to connect constituent material properties and their
geometric arrangement to effective composite properties and performance.
However, the reality of as-manufactured materials often differs from the ideal,
both in terms of tow geometry and manufacturing heterogeneity. As such,
resultant composite properties may differ from analytical predictions and
exhibit significant local variations within a material.
We employ mesoscale finite element method simulations to compare idealized
analytical and as-manufactured woven composite materials and study the
sensitivity of their effective properties to the mesoscale geometry.
Three-dimensional geometries are reconstructed from X-ray computed tomography,
image segmentation is performed using deep learning methods, and local fiber
orientation is obtained using the structure tensor calculated from image scans.
Suitable approximations to composite properties, using analytical unit cell
calculations and effective media theory, are assessed. Our findings show that
an analytical geometry and sub-unit cell geometry provide reasonable
predictions for the effective thermal properties of a multi-layer production
composite.

<h3>Hysteresis and training effect in the electric control of spin current  in Pt/Y3Fe5O12 heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have reported on the hysteresis and training effect of spin current in
Pt/Y3Fe5O12 heterostructures during subsequent cycles of ionic liquid gate
voltage Vg. The inverse spin Hall effect voltage in spin pumping and spin Hall
magnetoresistance exhibit diode-like behaviors in the first half cycle of Vg
andalsoshowhysteresisinthe first cycle of Vg. Both the diode-like behavior and
the hysteresis become weak and even vanish in the second cycle of Vg due to the
training effect. The above experimental results can be well explained by the
screening charge doping model, in which the charge and the local magnetic
moment are asymmetrically distributed in the Pt layer. The applicability of
this model is further confirmed by measurements of anisotropic
magnetoresistance and ferromagnetic resonance. The diode-like behavior is
attributed to interplay between the asymmetrically distributed local magnetic
moment and the spin current relaxation in the Pt layer. The hysteresis and the
training effect arise from the incompletely reversible process between
oxidation and reduction of Pt atoms and the evolution of the surface morphology
at the ionic liquid/Pt interface under electric gating. This work provides new
insights to improve the functional performance of electrically controlled spin
current devices.

The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is a second-order optical process in
noncentrosymmetric materials that converts the light into DC currents. BPVE is
classified into shift current and injection current according to the generation
mechanisms, whose dependence on the polarization of light is sensitive to the
spatial and time-reversal symmetry of materials. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study on the BPVE response of $EuSn_2As_2$ with different
magnetic structures through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculation.
We demonstrate that the interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) $EuSn_2As_2$ of
even-layer breaks the inversion symmetry and has the second-order optical
responses. Moreover, the bilayer AFM $EuSn_2As_2$ not only displays distinct
BPVE responses when magnetic moments align in different directions, but also
shows symmetry-related responses in two phases which have mutually
perpendicular in-plane magnetic moments. Due to the dependence of BPVE
responses on the polarization of light and magnetic symmetry, these magnetic
structures can be distinguished by the circular polarized light with
well-designed experiments. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of the BPVE
response as a tool to probe the magnetic structure.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are currently considered a successor to silicon in
future nanoelectronic devices. To realize this, controlled growth of
defect-free semiconducting nanotubes is required. Until now, the understanding
of atomic-scale CNT growth mechanisms provided by molecular dynamics
simulations has been hampered by their short timescales. Here, we develop an
efficient and accurate machine learning force field, DeepCNT-22, to simulate
the complete growth of defect-free single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) on iron
catalysts at near-microsecond time scales. We provide atomic-level insight into
the nucleation and growth processes of SWCNTs, including the evolution of the
tube-catalyst interface and the mechanisms underlying defect formation and
healing. Our simulations highlight the maximization of SWCNT-edge
configurational entropy during growth and how defect-free CNTs can grow
ultralong if carbon supply and temperature are carefully controlled.

State-of-the-art techniques for simulating deeply supercooled liquids require
a high degree of size polydispersity to be effective. While these techniques
have enabled great insight into the microscopic dynamics near the glass
transition, the effect of the artificially introduced polydispersity on the
dynamics has remained largely unstudied. Here we show that a particle's size
not only has a strong correlation with its mobility, but we also observe that,
as the mode-coupling temperature is crossed and the system becomes more deeply
supercooled, a dynamic separation between small mobile and larger quiescent
particles emerges at timescales corresponding to cage escape. Our results
suggest that the cage escape of this population of mobile particles facilitates
the later structural relaxation of the quiescent particles. This indicates that
it is of vital importance to account for particle size effects when
generalizing results to other glass-forming systems.

Antiferromagnetic (AF) materials hold potential for use in spintronic devices
with fast operation frequencies and robustness against magnetic field
perturbations. However, the precise tuning of material properties such as
magnetic anisotropy and domain structure is crucial for efficient device
functionality, yet poorly understood in fully compensated antiferromagnets.
This study clarifies the mechanisms governing domain formation in
antiferromagnetic devices by investigating the AF domains in patterned
structures fabricated from CuMnAs and Mn$_2$Au thin films, which are key
materials in antiferromagnetic spintronics research. The results reveal that
patterned edges have a significant impact on the magnetic anisotropy and AF
domain structure over long ranges, which can be modeled through the
consideration of short-range edge anisotropy and long-range magnetoelastic
interactions. The non-trivial interaction of magnetostriction, substrate
clamping, and edge anisotropy leads to specific equilibrium AF domain
configurations in devices. This study explores the use of antiferromagnetic
domain engineering through patterning to enhance device performance in both
CuMnAs and Mn$_2$Au materials, which are the only known materials clearly
associated with N\'eel spin orbit torques. By comparing two materials with the
same magnetocrystalline symmetry but different elastic and magnetic anisotropy
constants, the study disentangles the magnetic and elastic interactions which
result in specific antiferromagnetic domain formation. These principles are
applicable to all antiferromagnetic films grown on non-magnetic substrates as
required for applications.

Suppression of the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$

cuprates. This effect is most dramatic in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$, in which it
coincides with a transition from a low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) to a
low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) structure that hosts stripe order. It is
observed in experiments that anisotropic pressure influences both the LTO-LTT
phase transition temperature and $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. To gain a microscopic
understanding of this phenomenon, we use density-functional theory to calculate
the relative stability of LTO and LTT phases under different conditions of
uniaxial strain. Our calculations focus on La$_2$CuO$_4$ and La$_2$MgO$_4$, the
latter being a recently-synthesised surrogate with the same sequence of
structural phase transitions as La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$, but without
the difficulties associated with simulating systems with strong electron
correlations. Strikingly, we find that compressive strain applied diagonally to
the in-plane metal-oxygen bonds dramatically stabilises the LTO phase. Given
the mutual exclusivity of three-dimensional superconductivity and long-range
static stripe order, our results provide a structural mechanism for
understanding experimentally observed trends in $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ under uniaxial
pressure, and suggest principles for tuning it.

Point defects in diamond may act as quantum bits. Recently, oxygen-vacancy
related defects have been proposed to the origin of the so-called ST1 color
center in diamond that can realize a long-living solid-state quantum memory.
Motivated by this proposal we systematically investigate oxygen-vacancy
complexes in diamond by means of first principles density functional theory
calculations. We find that all the considered oxygen-vacancy defects have a
high-spin ground state in their neutral charge state, which disregards them as
an origin for the ST1 color center. We identify a high-spin metastable
oxygen-vacancy complex and characterize their magnetooptical properties for
identification in future experiments.

This work put forward a comprehensive study of moire pattern in commensurate
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) to determine the connection of moire period with
corresponding twist angle. Using the understanding of moire pattern,
computational codes are developed to simulate the planar positions of carbon
atoms lying in a large specimen of commensurate twisted bilayer graphene (CTBG)
with any commensurate twist angle. With the help of simulated moire patterns of
CTBG it is demonstrated that for many commensurate twist angles the apparent
moire period may be quite different from the actual moire period, and the same
moire pattern may have multiple slightly different values of the apparent moire
period. These multiple slightly different values of the apparent moire period
show that strain and broken rotational symmetry in moire pattern of CTBG are
intrinsic. From various values of apparent moire period, the apparent strain in
moire pattern of CTBG is calculated for many commensurate twist angles; the
calculated values of apparent strain are in good agreement with experimentally
reported values. Taking some insight from available experimental data related
to twisted bilayer graphene systems and conventional bilayer graphene systems,
corrugation in CTBG is modelled and incorporated with the simulated positions
of carbon atoms.

<br>
Anharmonicity and disorder are ubiquitous in the physics of perovskites and
give rise to several unique phenomena observed in scattering and spectroscopy
experiments with profound consequences for device applications. Several of
these phenomena still lack interpretation from a first-principles perspective
since, hitherto, no approach is available to account for anharmonicity and
disorder in the phonon dynamics and electron-phonon couplings. Here, relying on
the special displacement method, we develop a unified framework for the
treatment of both and demonstrate that electron-phonon coupling in cubic oxide
and halide perovskites is strongly influenced by the multi-well potential
energy landscape. We uncover that disorder is at the origin of phonon bunching
and overdamping in halide perovskites leading to vibrational dynamics far from
the ideal phonon picture. We also clarify a long standing problem in electronic
structure calculations of cubic perovskites and show that band gap corrections
arising from disorder, spin-orbit coupling, more accurate exchange-correlation
functionals, and electron-phonon coupling are all essential. Our results are in
excellent agreement with scattering and optical spectroscopy measurements,
suggesting that disorder is the key to address pending questions on
perovskites' technological applications.

The films of FeSe on substrates have attracted attention because of their
unusually high-temperature (Tc) superconducting properties whose origins
continue to be debated. To disentangle the competing effects of the substrate
and interlayer and intralayer processes, we present here results of density
functional theory (DFT)-based analysis of the electronic structure of
unsupported FeSe films consisting of 1 to 5 layers (1L-5L). Furthermore, by
solving the Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper (BCS) equation with spin-wave exchange
attraction derived from the Hubbard model, we find the superconducting critical
temperature Tc for 1L-5L and bulk FeSe systems in reasonable agreement with
experimental data. Our results point to the importance of correlation effects
in superconducting properties of single- and multi-layer FeSe films,
independently of the role of substrate.

An equation describing subdiffusion with possible immobilization of particles
is derived by means of the continuous time random walk model. The equation
contains a fractional time derivative of Riemann--Liouville type which is a
differential-integral operator with the kernel defined by the Laplace
transform. We propose the method for calculating the inverse Laplace transform
providing the kernel in the time domain. In the long time limit the
subdiffusion--immobilization process reaches a stationary state in which the
probability density of a particle distribution is an exponential function.

The Kondo lattice is one of the classic examples of strongly correlated
electronic systems. We conduct a controlled study of the Kondo lattice in one
dimension, highlighting the role of excitations created by the composite
fermion operator. Using time-dependent matrix-product-state methods we compute
various correlation functions and contrast them with both large-N mean-field
theory and the strong-coupling expansion. We show that the composite fermion
operator creates long-lived, charge-e and spin-1/2 excitations, which cover the
low-lying single-particle excitation spectrum of the system. Furthermore, spin
excitations can be thought to be composed of such fractionalized
quasi-particles with a residual interaction which tend to disappear at weak
Kondo coupling.

susceptibility in the normal state of Iron-based superconductors in presence of

selectivity toward localization of $xy$ orbitals and its interplay with

valence bond theory of superconductivity in Iron-based superconductors with the
more conventional $s_\pm$ pairing and show that both favor a superconductivity

Microcapsules with liquid cores encapsulated by thin membranes have many
applications in science, medicine and industry. In this paper, we design a
suspension of microcapsules which flow and deform like red blood cells (RBCs),
as a valuable tool to investigate microhaemodynamics. A reconfigurable and
easy-to-assemble 3D nested glass capillary device is used to robustly fabricate
water-oil-water double emulsions which are then converted into spherical
microcapsules with hyperelastic membranes by cross-linking the
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer coating the droplets. The resulting capsules
are monodisperse to within 1% and can be made in a wide range of size and
membrane thickness. We use osmosis to deflate by 36% initially spherical
capsules of diameter 350 {\mu}m and a membrane thickness of 4% of their radius,
in order to match the reduced volume of biconcave RBCs. We compare the
propagation of initially spherical and deflated capsules under constant
volumetric flow in cylindrical capillaries of different confinements. We find
that only deflated capsules deform broadly similarly to RBCs over a similar
range of capillary numbers (Ca) -- the ratio of viscous to elastic forces.
Similarly to the RBCs, the microcapsules transition from a symmetric
'parachute' to an asymmetric 'slipper'-like shape as Ca increases within the
physiological range, demonstrating intriguing confinement-dependent dynamics.
In addition to biomimetic RBC properties, high-throughput fabrication of
tunable ultra-soft microcapsules could be further functionalized and find
applications in other areas of science and engineering

CeCoSi with no local inversion symmetric crystal structure ($P4/nmm$)
exhibits a phase transition of unknown origin (Hidden Order: HO) at about 12~K
($T_0$) above the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_{\rm N}=9.4$~K).
We investigated the electronic structure at the HO phase with high-precision
reflection spectroscopy. Below the photon energy $\hbar \omega$ of 300~meV,
except for optical phonon peaks at $\hbar \omega \sim 20$ and 40~meV, a typical
metallic behavior above $T_0$ changes to an energy-gap-like structure at around
15 meV overlaid on the Drude component below $T_0$, implying the slight change
of the electronic structure near the Fermi level. The electronic structure
modification at the HO phase is considered to originate from the
electronic/valence instability.

To investigate the possibility of measuring the intermolecular and
intramolecular anharmonic coupling of balk water, we calculate third-order
two-dimensional (2D) infrared (IR) spectra and fifth-order 2D IR-IR-Raman-Raman
spectra expressed in terms of four-body correlation functions of optical
observables. For this purpose, a multimode Brownian oscillator model of four
interacting anharmonic oscillators strongly coupled to their respective heat
baths is employed. The nonlinearity of the system-bath interactions is
considered to describe thermal relaxation and vibrational dephasing. The linear
and nonlinear spectra are then computed in a non-Markovian and nonperturbative
regime in a rigorous manner using the discretized hierarchical equations of
motion in mixed Liouville-Wigner space (DHEOM-MLWS). The calculated 2D spectra
for stretching-bending, bending-librational, stretching-librational, and
stretching-translational modes consist of various positive and negative peaks
exhibiting essential details of the intermolecular and intramolecular mode-mode
interactions under thermal relaxation and dephasing at finite temperature.

Building materials such as concretes and mortar are formed by solidifying
granular slabs. Such materials are often fractured by giant forces such as
during earthquakes, leading to the collapse of structures and potentially
casualties. One avenue of enquiry to prevent cracking would be to realize a
material that can maintain a stable shape without being solidified. Here, we
focus on sand grains coated with silicone oil, experimentally investigating the
Young's modulus of a granular slab where ordinary grains and the coated grains
are mixed in a mixing ratio $\alpha$. It is found that the Young's modulus
increases rapidly at $\alpha \ge 0.6$. We use numerical simulation to show that
this sudden increase in the Young's modulus is caused by a rigidity percolation
transition. Furthermore, we are able to show that granular slabs containing
coated sand have outstanding deformability without collapsing under large
external stress. We believe this may lead to the development of granular
materials that are rigid under usual pressures but deformable under more
extreme conditions, such as during seismic activity.

Magnetic properties of thin films differs from that of the corresponding bulk

Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a

fabricated using monolayer $\mathrm{WTe_2}$. We find that consideration of the
two dimensional superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of
magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. Our fabrication procedures
suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically

Understanding the phonon properties in GaN nanostructures is critical for
thermal transport tuning in the near-junction thermal management of GaN
electronics, especially the topological phonon properties related to the
low-dissipative surface phonon states. In this work, a comprehensive study on
phonon modes and topological phonon properties is performed from the first
principles in (GaN)x/(AlN)x and (AlGaN)x/(GaN)x (x=1,2,3) superlattices. Phonon
modes including the dispersion relation, the density of state, and the
participation ratio are calculated for six GaN superlattices. Localized phonon
mode is not found based on the participation ratio results. In topological
phonon analyses, it is found that single Weyl phonons are present in all six
GaN superlattice structures consisting of the trivial (GaN) and nontrivial (AlN
and AlGaN) combinations and are located at two sides of the kz=0 plane
symmetrically in the Brillouin zone. With the increase of the phonon branches
in superlattices, the number of Weyl phonon points also increases from dozens
to hundreds. One Weyl phonon with significant and clean surface states is
selected and analyzed for each GaN superlattice. Among them, the Weyl phonon in
(GaN)2/(AlN)2 superlattice mainly results from the lattice vibration of Al and
Ga atoms, while the Weyl phonons in other superlattices mainly result from the
lattice vibration of N atoms. And the Weyl phonons at opposite kz planes are
formed into a pair in (GaN)2/(AlN)2, AlGaN/GaN, and (AlGaN)2/(GaN)2. The
investigation in this work is promising to provide a deeper understanding of
phonon properties and the topological effects of phonons in GaN nanostructures.

The control of electron spin, which is crucial to the stability of matter,
offers new possibilities for manipulating the properties of molecules and
materials with potential applications in spintronics and chemical reactions.
Recent experiments have demonstrated that electron transmission through chiral
molecules depends on the electron spin orientation, a phenomenon known as
chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we show that CISS can be
observed in achiral systems driven by an external circularly polarized laser
field in the framework of Floquet engineering. By using the Floquet theory for
a time-periodically driven system to investigate spin-dependent electron
transport in a two-terminal setup, we demonstrate that the spin polarization
can approach unity if the light intensity is sufficiently strong, the rate of
dephasing is sufficiently small, and the average chemical potential of the two
leads is within an appropriate range of values, which is narrow because of the
high frequency of the laser field. To obtain a wider range of energies for
large spin polarization, a combination of chiral molecules and light-matter
interactions is considered and the spin polarization of electrons transported
through a helical molecule driven by a laser field is evaluated.

Efficient and fast manipulation of antiferromagnets has to date remained a
challenging task, hindering their application in spintronic devices. For
ultrafast operation of such devices, it is highly desirable to be able to
control the antiferromagnetic order within picoseconds - a timescale that is
difficult to achieve with electrical circuits. Here, we demonstrate that bursts
of spin-polarized hot-electron currents emerging due to laser-induced ultrafast
demagnetization are able to efficiently excite spin dynamics in
antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Au by exerting a spin-transfer torque on femtosecond
timescales. We combine quantitative superdiffusive transport and atomistic
spin-model calculations to describe a spin-valve-type trilayer consisting of
Fe$|$Cu$|$Mn$_2$Au. Our results demonstrate that femtosecond spin-transfer
torques can switch the Mn$_2$Au layer within a few picoseconds. In addition, we
find that spin waves with high frequencies up to several THz can be excited in
Mn$_2$Au.

Interactions between electrons and phonons play a crucial role in quantum
materials. Yet, there is no universal method that would simultaneously
accurately account for strong electron-phonon interactions and electronic
correlations. By combining methods of the variational quantum eigensolver and
the variational non-Gaussian solver, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical
algorithm suitable for this type of correlated systems. This hybrid method
tackles systems with arbitrarily strong electron-phonon coupling without
increasing the number of required qubits and quantum gates, as compared to
purely electronic models. We benchmark the new method by applying it to the
paradigmatic Hubbard-Holstein model at half filling, and show that it correctly
captures the competition between charge density wave and antiferromagnetic
phases, quantitatively consistent with exact diagonalization.

The recent measurement of the de Haas-van Alphen effect in the spin-triplet
superconductor UTe2 [D. Aoki et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 91, 083704 (2002)]
supports cylindrical electron and hole Fermi surfaces, which implies that UTe2
is trivial as a 3D time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor. Inspired
by this observation, we investigate the possible realization of a topological
crystalline superconductor protected by the crystalline symmetry of UTe2. We
examine Majorana surface states protected by mirror and two-fold rotational
symmetries for all symmetry-allowed odd-parity pairing states with
time-reversal symmetry and clarify the corresponding topological invariants. It
is found that topological crystalline superconductivity can be realized for all
irreducible representations of odd-parity pairing states of UTe2 even for
cylindrical Fermi surfaces.

We investigate magnetotransport across an interface between two Weyl
semimetals whose Weyl nodes project onto different interface momenta. Such an
interface generically hosts Fermi arcs that connect Weyl nodes of identical
chirality in different Weyl semimetals (homochiral connectivity) -- in contrast
to surface Fermi arcs that connect opposite-chirality Weyl nodes within the
same Weyl semimetal (heterochiral connectivity). We show that electron
transport along the arcs with homochiral connectivity, in the presence of a
longitudinal magnetic field, leads to a universal longitudinal
magnetoconductance of $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum. Furthermore, a weak
tunnel coupling can result in a close encounter of two homochiral-connectivity
Fermi arcs, enabling magnetic breakdown. Above the breakdown field the
interface Fermi arc connectivity is effectively heterochiral, leading to a
saturation of the conductance.

We consider a model of free fermions in a ladder geometry coupled to a
non-uniform cavity mode via Peierls substitution. Since the cavity mode
generates a magnetic field, no-go theorems on spontaneous photon condensation
do not apply, and we indeed observe a phase transition to a superradiant phase.
We consider both square and triangular ladder geometries, and characterize the
transition by studying the energy structure of the system, light-matter
entanglement, the properties of the photon mode, and chiral currents. The
superradiant transition is of first order and corresponds to a sudden change in
the fermionic band structure as well as the number of its Fermi points. Thanks
to the quasi-one dimensional geometry we scrutinize the accuracy of (mean
field) cavity-matter decoupling against large scale density-matrix
renormalization group simulations. We find that light-matter entanglement is
essential for capturing corrections to matter properties at finite sizes and
for the description of the correct photon state. The latter remains Gaussian in
the the thermodynamic limit both in the normal and superradiant phases.

Materials design requires systematic and broadly applicable methods to
extract structure--property relationships. In the context of molecules,
physics-based representations are key ingredients for the subsequent machine
learning of various properties. We focus here on thermodynamic properties of
(complex) molecular liquids: establishing links between condensed-phase
intermolecular structures and thermodynamic properties. Compared to electronic
properties, they pose two challenges: ($i$) a Boltzmann-ensemble representation
and ($ii$) the relevance of the environment. We address these aspects by
adapting the Spectrum of London and Axilrod-Teller-Muto representation (SLATM).
Atomic representations describe both covalent and non-covalent interactions,
which we sum over all constituents of a molecule. We further ensemble-average
the representation to relate it to thermodynamic properties. As an application,
we focus here on a challenging biomolecular system: lipid selectivity of small
molecules in mitochondrial membranes. We rely on coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulations. Dimensionality reduction of the ensemble SLATM using
principal components reveals simple, interpretable relationships between
structure and free energy. Our methodology offers a systematic route to connect
higher-order intermolecular interactions with thermodynamics.

For bosons with flat energy dispersion, condensation can occur in different

hopping, which in the presence of mean-field interactions exhibit degenerate
condensates in the $\Gamma$- and the $K$-point. We analyze the excitation above
both condensates and find strikingly different properties: For the $K$-point
condensate, the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian has broken particle-hole
symmetry (PHS) and exhibits a topologically trivial quasiparticle band
structure. However, band flatness plays a key role in breaking the time
reversal symmetry (TRS) of the BdG Hamiltonian for a $\Gamma$-point condensate.
Consequently, its quasiparticle band structure exhibits non-trivial topology,
characterized by non-zero Chern numbers and the presence of edge states.
Although quantum fluctuations energetically favor the $K$-point condensate, the
interesting properties of the $\Gamma$-point condensate become relevant for
anisotropic hopping. The topological properties of the $\Gamma$-point
condensate get even richer in the presence of extended Bose-Hubbard
interactions. We find a topological phase transition into a topological
condensate characterized by high Chern number and also comment on the
realization and detection of such excitations.

We investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the atomic and
electronic structure of a twisted MoSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ heterobilayer using a
combination of classical molecular dynamics and \textit{ab-initio} density
functional theory calculations. Our calculations reveal that thermally excited
phason modes give rise to an almost rigid motion of the moir\'e lattice.
Electrons and holes in low-energy states are localized in specific stacking
regions of the moir\'e unit cell and follow the thermal motion of these
regions. In other words, charge carriers surf phason waves that are excited at
finite temperatures. Small displacements at the atomic scale are amplified at
the moir\'e scale, which gives rise to significant surfing speeds. We also show
that such surfing survives in the presence of a substrate and disorder. This
effect has potential implications for the design of charge and exciton
transport devices based on moir\'e materials.

<h3>Combination effect of growth enhancers and carbon sources on synthesis  of single-walled carbon nanotubes from solid carbon growth seeds</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the synthesis of highly crystalline single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs), high growth temperatures are preferred, while the formation of
impurity amorphous carbon (a-C) causes the termination of SWCNT growth and
degrades its properties. To remove this by-product, H2O and CO2 have been
employed in metal-catalyzed SWCNT growth systems because of their oxidizing
ability. Recently, nonmetallic nanoparticles have become one of the growth seed
candidates because of their high melting points and fewer metal impurities. In
this study, by using nanodiamond-derived carbon nanoparticles as the solid
growth seeds, we investigated the effect of CO2 and H2O on high-temperature
SWCNT growth with two types of carbon-source supplies: C2H2 and C2H4. In this
growth system, H2O showed oxidizing ability to etch a-C with either carbon
sources. CO2 exhibited a similar a-C formation-preventing role in C2H4-supplied
growth and achieved higher-purity SWCNTs with higher concentration of C2H4 than
the case of H2O. However, in contrast to the other combinations, CO2 injection
in the C2H2-supplied growth significantly enhanced the formation of a-C rather
than the removal of it while the yield of SWCNTs was also increased, indicating
the occurrence of the dehydration reaction between CO2 and C2H2. The present
findings will lead to efficient growth of high-quality SWCNTs from nonmetallic
growth seeds with the use of growth enhancers.

<h3>Adiabatic computing for optimal thermodynamic efficiency of information  processing</h3>

Handling information in the physical world requires energy: Landauer's
principle makes a strong connection between information theory and
thermodynamics by stating that the erasure of a one-bit memory requires a work
larger than $W_{LB}=k_BT_0 \ln2=3.10^{-21}\,\mathrm{J}$ at room temperature
$T_0$, with $k_B$ Boltzmann's constant. This tiny limit has been experimentally
illustrated, using quasi-static processes in model experiments. However when
decreasing the duration of operations, an energy overhead proportional to the
processing speed appears. Bypassing this overhead for fast operations would be
a huge step towards efficient information processing. We show that underdamped
systems are the winning strategy to reduce this energetic cost. We prove both
experimentally and theoretically that, in the limit of vanishing dissipation
mechanisms in the memory, the physical system is thermally insulated from its
environment during fast erasures, i.e. fast protocols are adiabatic as no heat
is exchanged with the bath. Using a fast optimal erasure protocol we also show
that these adiabatic processes produce a maximum adiabatic temperature
$T_a=2T_0$, and that Landauer's bound for fast erasures in underdamped systems
becomes the adiabatic bound: $W_a = k_B T_0$.

We use a combination of variable-temperature / variable-pressure neutron
powder diffraction, variable-pressure inelastic neutron scattering, and quantum
chemical calculations to interrogate the behaviour of the negative thermal
expansion (NTE) material $^{114}$Cd(CN)$_2$ under hydrostatic pressure. We
determine the equation of state of the ambient-pressure phase, and discover the
so-called `warm hardening' effect whereby the material becomes elastically
stiffer as it is heated. We also identify a number of high-pressure phases, and
map out the phase behaviour of Cd(CN)$_2$ over the range $0\leq p\leq0.5$\,GPa,
$100\leq T\leq300$\,K. As expected for an NTE material, the low-energy phonon
frequencies are found to soften under pressure, and we determine an effective
Gr{\"u}neisen parameter for these modes. Finally, we show that the elastic
behaviour of Cd(CN)$_2$ is sensitive to the local Cd coordination environment,
which suggests an interplay between short- (phononic) and long-timescale
(cyanide flips) fluctuations in Cd(CN)$_2$.

a uniform magnetic field $\hat{\bm B}$, as this is the simplest instance in
which a transverse spatially-varying $\hat{\bm A}({\bm r})$ is at play. We show
that when the molecules are in the Van Vleck paramagnetic regime, an

<h3>On the Kemeny time for continuous-time reversible and irreversible  Markov processes with applications to stochastic resetting and to  conditioning towards forever-survival</h3>

<i>Alain Mazzolo, Cecile Monthus</i>
<br>
<br>
For continuous-time ergodic Markov processes, the Kemeny time $\tau_*$ is the
characteristic time needed to converge towards the steady state $P_*(x)$ : in
real-space, the Kemeny time $\tau_*$ corresponds to the average of the
Mean-First-Passage-Time $\tau(x,x_0) $ over the final configuration $x$ drawn
with the steady state $P_*(x)$, which turns out to be independent of the
initial configuration $x_0$; in the spectral domain, the Kemeny time $\tau_*$
corresponds to the sum of the inverses of all the non-vanishing eigenvalues
$\lambda_n \ne 0 $ of the opposite generator. We describe many illustrative
examples involving jumps and/or diffusion in one dimension, where the Kemeny
time can be explicitly computed as a function of the system-size, via its
real-space definition and/or via its spectral definition : we consider both
reversible processes satisfying detailed-balance where the eigenvalues are
real, and irreversible processes characterized by non-vanishing steady currents
where the eigenvalues can be complex. In particular, we study the specific
properties of the Kemeny times for Markov processes with stochastic resetting,
and for absorbing Markov processes conditioned to survive forever.

<br>
Density Functional Theory has allowed us to reach scales unattainable with
exact theories, however, when it comes to accuracy, it has some fundamental
limitations, exactly due to the fact that it is based on the density functional
approximation. Herein, we propose a high-throughput benchmarking technique for
the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals and
pseudopotentials applied to bulk SnS. It is shown that, contrary to the popular
view that the local density approximation can best describe layered materials,
a semi-local pseudopotential with a functional having a gradient dependence
better described lattice vectors and `tetragonicity' of the lattice. We
compared the hybridization between the orbitals related to the `revised lone
pair model' using a high-throughput wannierization process and found that the
choice of the pseudopotential affects the results in a different way than
choosing different anions in Sn(II) compounds. Furthermore, the largest Born
effective charge values were given by the approximation that produced the
highest lattice symmetry, but also the highest Sn-S charge imbalance. Our work
proposes a connection between a quantum chemistry problem and its practical
application, to be used for testing the efficacy of different methods in
describing controversial intrinsic material properties.

<h3>Observation of near room temperature thin film superconductivity of  atmospherically stable Ag-Au mesoscopic thin film</h3>

An environmentally stable mesoscopic thin film of Au of certain thickness has
been deposited thermally on top of a Ag+ implanted oxide substrate to develop a
close to room temperature superconductor. This thin film has been deposited in
two different stages. Initially, a sol-gel derived ion conducting metal oxide
(ICMO) thin film has been deposited by spin coating. Afterward, Ag+ has been
introduced inside ICMO thin film by a chemical method. Following this, a thin
layer of Au has been deposited on top of that Ag ion-implanted oxide via
thermal evaporation. The temperature dependent resistivity (R-T) has been
studied by four probe method. During high-to-low temperature sweep, around 240
K this thin film sample shows a sudden drop of resistance from 0.7 Ohm to 0.1
micro-Ohm. This 6-7 orders drop of resistance has been observed instantly
within <0.1 K temperature variation of the sample. This transition temperature
(TC) has been shifted toward the higher temperature by 5-6 degrees when
temperature has been increased from low to the higher side. During 2nd and 3rd
temperature cycling, both these transitions have been shifted by ~10 K towards
room temperature w.r.t the earlier. However, after three successive temperature
cycles, TC becomes stable and transitions occur close to 0 oC repeatedly. At
the low resistance phase, current level has been varied from +100 mA to -100 mA
which shows a random fluctuation of voltage drop within 10 nV range, indicating
resistance under such circumstance is too low to measure by Delta mode
electrical measurement (0.1 micro-Ohm). Besides, transition temperature reduces
to lower temperature by 4 K, after applying 1 tesla magnetic field
perpendicular to the thin film. Few YouTube video links of temperature
dependent electrical characterization of such a thin film is given next to the
acknowledgement section.

4$f$ electron-based topological Kondo insulators have long been researched
for their potential to conduct electric current via protected surface states,
while simultaneously exhibiting unusually robust insulating behavior in their
interiors. To this end, we have investigated the electrical transport of the
3$d$-based correlated insulators FeSi and FeSb$_2$, which have exhibited enough
similarities to their $f$ electron cousins to warrant investigation. By using a
double-sided Corbino disk transport geometry, we show unambiguous evidence of
surface conductance in both of these Fe-based materials. In addition, by using
a 4-terminal Corbino inverted resistance technique, we extract the bulk
resistivity as a function of temperature. Similar to topological Kondo
insulator SmB$_6$, the bulk resistivity of FeSi and FeSb$_2$ are confirmed to
exponentially increase by up to 9 orders of magnitude from room temperature to
the lowest accessible temperature. This demonstrates that these materials are
excellent bulk insulators, providing an ideal platform for studying correlated
2D physics.

<h3>Properties of Laughlin states on fractal lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Laughlin states have recently been constructed on fractal lattices and have
been shown to be topological in such systems. Some of their properties are,
however, quite different from the two-dimensional case. On the Sierpinski
triangle, for instance, the entanglement entropy shows oscillations as a
function of particle number and does not obey the area law despite being
topologically ordered, and the particle density is non-uniform in the bulk.
Here, we investigate these deviant properties in greater detail on the
Sierpinski triangle, and we also study the properties on the Sierpinski carpet
and the T-fractal. We find that the density variations across the fractal are
present for all the considered fractal lattices and for most choices of the
number of particles. The size of anyons inserted into the lattice Laughlin
state also varies with position on the fractal lattice. We observe that
quasiholes and quasiparticles have similar sizes and that the size of the
anyons typically increases with decreasing Hausdorff dimension. As opposed to
periodic lattices in two dimensions, the Sierpinski triangle and carpet have
inner edges. We construct trial states for both inner and outer edge states. We
find that oscillations of the entropy as a function of particle number are
present for the T-fractal, but not for the Sierpinski carpet. Finally, we
observe deviations from the area law for several different bipartitions on the
Sierpinski triangle.

<h3>Inertia in spatial public goods games under weak selection</h3>

<br>
<br>
Due to limited cognitive skills for perceptual error or other emotional
reasons, players may keep their current strategies even if there is a more
promising choice. Such behavior inertia has already been studied, but its
consequences remained unexplored in the weak selection limit. To fill this gap,
we consider a spatial public goods game model where inertia is considered
during the imitation process. By using the identity-by-descent method, we
present analytical forms of the critical synergy factor $r^\star$, which
determines when cooperation is favored. We find that inertia hinders
cooperation, which can be explained by the decelerated coarsening process under
weak selection. Interestingly, the critical synergy conditions for different
updating protocols, including death-birth and birth-death rules, can be
formally linked by the extreme limits of the inertia factor. To explore the
robustness of our observations, calculations are made for different lattices
and group sizes. Monte Carlo simulations also confirm the results.

<h3>Dimensional crossover and symmetry transformation of the charge density  waves in VSe2</h3>

<br>
<br>
Collective phenomena in solids can be sensitive to the dimensionality of the
system; a case of special interest is VSe2, which shows a (r7 x r3) charge
density wave (CDW) in the single layer with the three-fold symmetry in the
normal phase spontaneously broken, in contrast to the (4 x 4) in-plane CDW in
the bulk. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) from VSe2 ranging
from a single layer to the bulk reveals the evolution of the electronic
structure including the Fermi surface contours and the CDW gap. At a thickness
of two layers, the ARPES maps are already nearly bulklike, but the transition
temperature TC for the (4 x 4) CDW is much higher than the bulk value of 110 K.
These results can be understood as a result of dimensional crossover of phonon
instability driven by a competition of nesting vectors. Our study provides key
insights into the CDW mechanisms and offers a perspective in the search and
control of emergent phases in quantum materials.

<br>
<br>
We compute the transmission coefficients and zero-temperature conductance for
chiral quasiparticles, propagating through various geometries, which consist of
junctions of three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals. In the first scenario,
we consider a potential step with two Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl or two birefringent
semimetals, which are tilted with respect to the other on the two sides of the
junction. The second set-up consists of a junction between a doped Dirac
semimetal and a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, where an intrinsic magnetization
present in the latter splits the degenerate Dirac nodes into a pair of Weyl
nodes. A scalar potential is also applied in the region where the Weyl
semimetal phase exists. Finally, we study sandwiches of Weyl/multi-Weyl
semimetals, with the middle region being subjected to both electric and vector
potentials. Our results show that a nonzero transmission spectrum exists where
the areas, enclosed by the Fermi surface projections (in the plane
perpendicular to the propagation axis) of the incidence and transmission
regions, overlap. Such features can help engineer unidirectional carrier
propagation, topologically protected against impurity backscattering, because
of the chiral nature of the charge carriers.

<h3>Infrared ellipsometry study of the charge dynamics in  K$_3$\,\!p-terphenyl</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report an infrared ellipsometry study of the charge carrier dynamics in
polycrystalline K$_{x}$\,\!p-terphenyl samples with nominal $x=3$, for which
signatures of high-temperature superconductivity were previously reported. The
infrared spectra are dominated by two Lorentzian bands with maxima around
4\,000\,cm$^{-1}$ and 12\,000\,cm$^{-1}$ which, from a comparison with
calculations based on a H\"uckel model are assigned to intra-molecular
excitations of $\pi$ electrons of the anionic p-terphenyl molecules. The
inter-molecular electronic excitations are much weaker and give rise to a Drude
peak and a similarly weak Lorentzian band around 220\,cm$^{-1}$. A dc
resistivity of about 0.3 $\Omega$cm at 300 K is deduced from the IR data,
comparable to values measured by electrical resistivity on a twin sample. The
analysis of the temperature dependence of the low-frequency response reveals a
gradual decrease of the plasma frequency and the scattering rate of the Drude
peak below 300 K that gets anomalously enhanced below {90}{K}. The
corresponding missing spectral weight of the Drude peak appears blue-shifted
towards the Lorentz-band at 220\,cm$^{-1}$. This characteristic blue-shift
signifies an enhanced localization of the charge carriers at low temperatures
and contrasts the behavior expected for a bulk superconducting state for which
the missing spectral weight would be redshifted to a delta-function at zero
frequency that accounts for the loss-free response of the superconducting
condensate. Our data might still be compatible with a filamentary
superconducting state with a volume fraction well below the percolation limit
for which the spatial confinement of the condensate can result in a plasmonic
resonance at finite frequency.

Exotic quantum phases and phase transition in the strongly interacting Dirac
systems has attracted tremendous interests. On the other hand, non-Hermitian
physics, usually associated with dissipation arising from the coupling to
environment, emerges as a frontier of modern physics in recent years. In this
letter, we investigate the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and strong
correlation in Dirac-fermion systems. We develop a sign-problem-free projector
quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) algorithm for the non-Hermitian interacting fermionic
systems. Employing state-of-the-art projector QMC simulation, we decipher the
ground-state phase diagram of the Honeycomb Hubbard model in the presence
non-Hermitian asymmetric spin resolved hopping processes. Intriguingly, the
antiferromagnetic ordering induced by Hubbard interaction is enhanced by the
non-Hermitian asymmetric hopping. More remarkably, our study reveals that
critical properties of the quantum phase transition between Dirac semi-metal
and AF ordered phases are consistent with the XY universality class in
Hermitian system, implying Hermiticity is emergent at the quantum critical
point. The numerically-exact QMC approach utilized in this study is easily
applied to other non-Hermitian interacting fermionic models, hence paving a new
avenue to investigating quantum many-body physics in non-Hermitian systems.

We analyze propagation of quantum information along chiral Majorana edge
states in two-dimensional topological materials. The use of edge states may
facilitate the braiding operation, an important ingredient in topological
quantum computations. For the edge of the Kitaev honeycomb model in a
topological phase, we discuss how the edge states can participate in
quantum-information processing, and consider a two-qubit logic gate between
distant external qubits coupled to the edge. Here we analyze the influence of
disorder and noise on properties of the edge states and quantum-gate fidelity.
We find that realistically weak disorder does not prevent one from
implementation of a high-fidelity operation via the edge.

We present a quantum inspired image augmentation protocol which is applicable
to classical images and, in principle, due to its known quantum formulation
applicable to quantum systems and quantum machine learning in the future. The
augmentation technique relies on the phenomenon Anderson localization. As we
will illustrate by numerical examples the technique changes classical wave
properties by interference effects resulting from scatterings at impurities in
the material. We explain that the augmentation can be understood as
multiplicative noise, which counter-intuitively averages out, by sampling over
disorder realizations. Furthermore, we show how the augmentation can be
implemented in arrays of disordered waveguides with direct implications for an
efficient optical image transfer.

<br>
<br>
We analyze pros and cons of the recently introduced theoretical framework,
within which the dynamics of nonequilibrium diffusion processes is related to
the fully Euclidean version of the Schr\"{o}dinger quantum mechanics with a
minimal electromagnetic coupling. The arising "magnetic" affinity is set
against the standard theory of the Brownian motion in a magnetic field. The
benefit is that the existing exact formulas for transition probability density
functions of the involved Markovian diffusion processes, can be mapped into
their (merely formal) path integral counterparts in the non-Hermitean setting
of [Phys. Rev. E 107,014101, (2023)]. This allows to discriminate beween the
standard Brownian magnetic lore and potentially useful electromagnetic
analogies appearing in the study of nonconservative diffusion processes, which
do not necessarily embody the very concept of electromagnetic perturbations of
diffusing charged particles, but extend far beyond this setting.

In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, the
entropy of a subsystem (smaller than half the system size) thermalizes if at
long times, it is to leading order equal to the thermodynamic entropy of the
subsystem at the same energy. In this paper, we prove entropy thermalization
for a nearly integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model initialized in a pure product
state. The model is obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body interactions
as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model.

Today, spinel ferrite nanoparticles are widely used in the medical field for
cancer treatment, drug delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent
due to their superior magnetic properties and biocompatibility. Due to the
strong dependence of magnetic properties on morphology and other structural
aspects, the magnetic properties of these nanoparticles depend on their
manufacturing process. One of the goals of the researchers is to improve the
magnetic properties of these nanoparticles by substituting elements such as
manganese, cobalt, zinc, nickel, magnesium and iron. In this research, first,
magnetic Zn0.3Fe0.6O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method in
the presence of citric acid as a reducing agent. In order to reduce the amount
of impurity and obtain the pure spinel phase and reduce the size of magnetic
nanoparticles, the hydrothermal process was carried out in the presence of
different concentrations of the reducing agent and pH level of the medium. The
structural investigations of the resulting nanoparticles were carried out by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results
showed that in order to obtain pure and single-phase spinel nanoparticles with
appropriate particle size and size distribution, it is necessary to control the
concentration of reducing agent and pH.

In recent years, two-dimensional Dirac materials patterned with a
superlattice structure have emerged as a rich platform for exploring correlated
and topological quantum matter. In this work, we propose that by subjecting
Dirac electrons to a periodic magnetic field with triangular lattice symmetry
it is possible to realize a quantum critical phase of $N_f=3$ Dirac fermion
species strongly coupled to an emergent gauge field, or 2+1-D quantum
electrodynamics (QED$_3$). We demonstrate explicitly that the QED$_3$ phase
naturally arises from a Dirac composite fermion (CF) picture, where the
periodic magnetic field manifests as a periodic CF potential and transforms the
CF Fermi surface into gapless Fermi points. We further show that by breaking
the particle-hole symmetry of the TI surface -- either by doping or by
introducing a periodic electrostatic potential with zero mean -- our quantum
critical phase gives way to a sequence of fractional Chern insulator phases.
Our theory illustrates the rich menagerie of quantum phases possible around
half filling of a flat Chern band.

Understanding the nature of charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity
in kagome metal AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs,Rb,K) is a recent subject of intensive
study. Due to the presence of van Hove singularities, electron-electron
interaction has been suggested to play an important role in the formation of
such broken symmetry states. Recent experiments show that the CDW order is
three-dimensional and it is staggered across different kagome layers. However,
the experimental interpretation for the precise structure of CDW varies in
terms of whether it is the star of David (SD), inverse star of David (ISD) or
the alternation of the two among neighboring layers. In this work, we show that
the origin of these distinct CDW orders can be understood in a unified picture
by considering intra- and inter-layer electron-electron interactions as well as
the coupling between electrons and lattice distortions. Utilizing an effective
9-band model with V $d$ orbitals and out-of-plane Sb $p$ orbitals, it is
demonstrated that the repulsive electron-electron interaction favors charge
bond order which induces either SD or ISD upon including lattice distortions.
As the inter-layer interaction is introduced, $\pi$-shifted CDW develops with
the staggered ordering along the $c$-axis. We also find that the phase with
alternating SD and ISD can be stabilized as the ground state under strong
inter-layer interaction.
