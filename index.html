<h3>Noncoplanar and chiral spin states on the way towards Néel ordering in  fullerene Heisenberg models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01496</a>

Using high-accuracy variational Monte Carlo based on group-convolutional
neural networks (GCNNs), we obtain the symmetry-resolved low-energy spectrum of
the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on several highly symmetric fullerene geometries,
including the famous C$_{60}$ buckminsterfullerene. We argue that as the degree
of frustration is lowered in large fullerenes, they display characteristic
features of incipient magnetic ordering: correlation functions show
high-intensity Bragg peaks consistent with N\'eel-like ordering, while the
low-energy spectrum is organised into a tower of states. Competition with
frustration, however, turns the simple N\'eel order into a noncoplanar one.
Remarkably, we find and predict chiral incipient ordering in a large number of
fullerene structures.

Spin-split superconductors offer new functionality compared to conventional
superconductors such as diode-effects and efficient thermoelectricity. The
superconducting state can nevertheless only withstand a small amount of
spin-splitting $m$. Here, we self-consistently determine the spin transport
properties and the phase diagram of a spin-split superconductor in the presence
of an injected spin accumulation. Energy and spin relaxation are accounted for
in the relaxation time approximation via a single effective inelastic
scattering parameter. We find that the spin-splitting field in the
superconductor enables a spin diode effect in the presence of such spin
relaxation. Moreover, we consider the superconducting phase diagram of such a
system when it is in contact with a spin accumulation, and find that the
inclusion of energy and spin relaxation alters the phase diagram qualitatively.
In particular, these mechanisms turn out to induce a superconducting state in
large parts of the phase diagram where a normal state would otherwise be the
ground-state. We identify an FFLO-like state even in the presence of impurity
scattering which can be controllably tuned on and off via the electrically
induced spin accumulation. We explain the underlying physics from how the
superconducting order parameter depends on the non-equilibrium modes in the
system as well as the behavior of these modes in the presence of energy and
spin relaxation when a spin-splitting field is present.

<h3>Expanded stability of layered SnSe-PbSe alloys and evidence of  displacive phase transformation from rocksalt in heteroepitaxial thin films</h3>

Bulk PbSnSe has a two-phase region or miscibility gap as the crystal changes
from a Van der Waals-bonded orthorhombic 2D layered structure in SnSe-rich
compositions to the related 3D-bonded rocksalt structure in PbSe-rich
compositions with large contrast in the electrical, optical, and thermal
properties across this transition. With an aim to understand and harness this
transition in thin films devices, we epitaxially integrate PbSnSe on GaAs by
molecular beam epitaxy using an in-situ PbSe surface treatment and show a
significantly reduced two-phase region by stabilizing the Pnma layered
structure out to Pb$_{0.45}$Sn$_{0.55}$Se, beyond the bulk-limit of
Pb$_{0.25}$Sn$_{0.75}$Se. Pushing further, we directly access metastable
two-phase epitaxial films of layered and rocksalt grains that are nearly
identical in composition around Pb$_{0.5}$Sn$_{0.5}$Se and entirely circumvent
the miscibility gap. We present microstructural evidence for an incomplete
displacive transformation from rocksalt to layered structure in these films
that we speculate occurs during the sample cool down to room temperature after
synthesis. In-situ x-ray diffraction measurement of an as-grown
Pb$_{0.56}$Sn$_{0.44}$Se rocksalt film under cryogenic cooling reproduces the
key attributes of this transition and validates our hypothesis. Notably, we
find well-defined orientation relationships between the phases forming in the
process and unconventional strain-relief mechanisms involved in the crystal
structure transformation by transmission electron microscopy. Overall, our work
adds a scalable thin film integration route to harnessing metastable layered
compositions as well as the dramatic contrast in material properties in PbSnSe
across a potentially ultrafast structural transition.

<h3>Signatures of dissipative quantum chaos</h3>

Understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative quantum
systems, where dissipation and decoherence coexist with unitary dynamics, is an
enormous challenge with immense rewards. Often, the only realistic approach is
to forgo a detailed microscopic description and search for signatures of
universal behavior shared by collections of many distinct, yet sufficiently
similar, complex systems. Quantum chaos provides a powerful statistical
framework for addressing this question, relying on symmetries to obtain
information not accessible otherwise. This thesis examines how to reconcile
chaos with dissipation, proceeding along two complementary lines. In Part I, we
apply non-Hermitian random matrix theory to open quantum systems with Markovian
dissipation and discuss the relaxation timescales and steady states of three
representative examples of increasing physical relevance: single-particle
Lindbladians and Kraus maps, open free fermions, and dissipative
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. In Part II, we investigate the symmetries,
correlations, and universality of many-body open quantum systems, classifying
several models of dissipative quantum matter. From a theoretical viewpoint,
this thesis lays out a generic framework for the study of the universal
properties of realistic, chaotic, and dissipative quantum systems. From a
practical viewpoint, it provides the concrete building blocks of dynamical
dissipative evolution constrained by symmetry, with potential technological
impact on the fabrication of complex quantum structures.

<h3>Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of money/energy exchange models</h3>

Many-body dynamical models in which Boltzmann statistics can be derived
directly from the underlying dynamical laws without invoking the fundamental
postulates of statistical mechanics are scarce. Interestingly, one such model
is found in econophysics and in chemistry classrooms: the money game, in which
players exchange money randomly in a process that resembles elastic
intermolecular collisions in a gas, giving rise to the Boltzmann distribution
of money owned by each player. Although this model offers a pedagogical example
that demonstrates the origins of Boltzmann statistics, such demonstrations
usually rely on computer simulations - a proof of the exponential steady-state
distribution in this model has only become available in recent years. Here, we
study this random money/energy exchange model, and its extensions, using a
simple mean-field-type approach that examines the properties of the
one-dimensional random walk performed by one of its participants. We give a
simple derivation of the Boltzmann steady-state distribution in this model.
Breaking the time-reversal symmetry of the game by modifying its rules results
in non-Boltzmann steady-state statistics. In particular, introducing "unfair"
exchange rules in which a poorer player is more likely to give money to a
richer player than to receive money from that richer player, results in an
analytically provable Pareto-type power-law distribution of the money in the
limit where the number of players is infinite, with a finite fraction of
players in the "ground state" (i.e., with zero money). For a finite number of
players, however, the game may give rise to a bimodal distribution of money and
to bistable dynamics, in which a participant's wealth jumps between poor and
rich states. The latter corresponds to a scenario where the player accumulates
nearly all the available money in the game.

<h3>Quantifying chemical short-range order in metallic alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01545</a>
<br>
<i>Killian Sheriff, Yifan Cao, Tess Smidt, Rodrigo Freitas</i>
<br>
<br>
Metallic alloys often form phases - known as solid solutions - in which
chemical elements are spread out on the same crystal lattice in an almost
random manner. The tendency of certain chemical motifs to be more common than
others is known as chemical short-range order (SRO) and it has received
substantial consideration in alloys with multiple chemical elements present in
large concentrations due to their extreme configurational complexity (e.g.,
high-entropy alloys). Short-range order renders solid solutions "slightly less
random than completely random", which is a physically intuitive picture, but
not easily quantifiable due to the sheer number of possible chemical motifs and
their subtle spatial distribution on the lattice. Here we present a multiscale
method to predict and quantify the SRO state of an alloy with atomic
resolution, incorporating machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between
electronic-structure calculations and the characteristic length scale of SRO.
The result is an approach capable of predicting SRO length scale in agreement
with experimental measurements while comprehensively correlating SRO with
fundamental quantities such as local lattice distortions. This work advances
the quantitative understanding of solid-solution phases, paving the way for SRO
rigorous incorporation into predictive mechanical and thermodynamic models.

<h3>Real-space Formalism for the Euler Class and Fragile Topology in  Quasicrystals and Amorphous Lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01557" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01557</a>
<br>
<i>Dexin Li, Citian Wang, Huaqing Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a real-space formalism of the topological Euler class, which
characterizes the fragile topology of two-dimensional systems with real wave
functions. This real-space description is characterized by local Euler markers
whose macroscopic average coincides with the Euler number, and it applies
equally well to periodic and open boundary conditions for both crystals and
noncrystalline systems. We validate this by diagnosing topological phase
transitions in clean and disordered crystalline systems with the reality
endowed by the space-time inversion symmetry $\mathcal{I}_{ST}$. Furthermore,
we demonstrated the topological Euler phases in quasicrystals and even in
amorphous lattices lacking any spatial symmetries. Our work not only provides a
local characterization of the fragile topology but also significantly extends
its territory beyond $\mathcal{I}_{ST}$-symmetric crystalline materials.

<h3>Sign-problem-free effective models of triangular lattice quantum  antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01572" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01572</a>
<br>
<i>Henry Shackleton, Subir Sachdev</i>
<br>
<br>
The triangular lattice antiferromagnet with $S=1/2$ spins and nearest
neighbor interactions is known to have long-range antiferromagnetic order, with
nearest-neighbor spins at an angle of 120 degrees. Numerical studies of quantum
phases proximate to this state have been limited to small systems because the
of the sign-problem in Monte Carlo simulations in imaginary time. We propose an
effective lattice model for quantum fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic
order, and a sign-problem free Monte Carlo algorithm, enabling studies in large
systems sizes. The model is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to
gauge-charged scalars which have a relativistic dispersion in the continuum
limit. Crucially, the gauge theory is odd, i.e. there is a static, background
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge on each site, accounting for the Berry phases of
the half-odd-integer spins on each site. We present results of simulations on
lattices of sizes up to $36 \times 36 \times 36$. Along with the
antiferromagnetically ordered phase, our phase diagram has a valence bond solid
state with a $\sqrt{12} \times \sqrt{12}$ unit cell, and a gapped
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid. Deconfined critical points or phases in
intermediate regions are not ruled out by our present simulations.

<h3>On the Electride Nature of Na-hP4</h3>

Early quantum mechanical models suggested that pressure drives solids towards
free-electron metal behavior where the ions are locked into simple close-packed
structures. The prediction and subsequent discovery of high-pressure electrides
(HPEs), compounds assuming open structures where the valence electrons are
localized in interstitial voids, required a paradigm shift. Our quantum
chemical calculations on the iconic insulating Na-hP4 HPE show that increasing
density causes a 3s -> 3pd electronic transition due to Coulomb repulsion
between the 1s2s and 3s states, and orthogonality of the 3pd states to the
core. The large lobes of the resulting Na-pd hybrid orbitals point towards the
center of an 11-membered penta-capped trigonal prism and overlap
constructively, forming multi-centered bonds, which are responsible for the
emergence of the interstitial charge localization in Na-hP4. These
multi-centered bonds facilitate the increased density of this phase, which is
key for its stabilization under pressure.

<h3>Controllable single spin evolution at sub-harmonics of electric dipole  spin resonance enhanced by four-level Landau-Zener-St{ü}ckelberg-Majorana  interference</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sub-harmonics of electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) mediated by
Landau-Zener-St{\"u}ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) tunneling transitions are studied
numerically and analytically in a Zeeman-split four level system with strong
spin-orbit coupling that can be realized, for example, in a GaAs-based double
quantum dot in a single-hole regime. The spin qubit is formed in one of the
dots and the second dot is used as an auxiliary element to enhance
functionality of the spin qubit. In particular, it is found that the spin
rotation rate can be essentially enhanced due to the tunnel coupling with the
auxiliary dot on both the main EDSR frequency and at its high sub-harmonics
allowing the coherent spin $\pi$-rotations on a 10-ns time scale. Spin
manipulation on high sub-harmonics is promising for new time-efficient schemes
of the spin control and readout in qubit devices operating at high magnetic
fields where the main harmonic is inaccessible due to hardware limitations.

<br>
The $5d^1$ ordered double perovskites present an exotic playground for
studying novel multi-polar physics due to large spin-orbit coupling. We present
Re L3 edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) results that reveal the
presence of the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in the A$_2$MgReO$_6$ (A = Ca, Sr,
Ba) family of $5d^1$ double perovskites. The spin-orbit excitations in these
materials show a strongly asymmetric lineshape and exhibit substantial
temperature dependence, indicating that they are dressed with lattice
vibrations. Our experimental results are explained quantitatively through a
RIXS calculation based on a spin-orbit-lattice entangled electronic ground
state with the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect taken into consideration. We find
that the spin-orbit-lattice entangled state is robust against magnetic and
structural phase transitions as well as against significant static Jahn-Teller
distortions. Our results illustrate the importance of including vibronic
coupling for a complete description of the ground state physics of $5d^1$
double perovskites. Usage: Secondary publications and information retrieval
purposes.

<h3>Correlation between spin state and activity for hydrogen evolution</h3>

Spin plays a key role in physical and chemical reactions, such as oxygen
evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER); but the spin-activity
correlation has remained unclear. Based on a transition metal (TM)-doped PtN2
monolayer model with a well-defined spin center as adsorption site, we here
reveal that only active spin state can enhance the strength of hydrogen
adsorption, while inert spin state offers very little influence. Specifically,
the unpaired electron along the out-of-plane direction such as in dZ2 orbital,
acting as an active spin state, will strongly hybridize with hydrogen,
resulting in enhanced hydrogen binding energy because dZ2 orbital is just
enough to accommodate two electrons to form a bonding orbital. While the
in-plane unpaired electron such as in dX2-Y2 orbital, plays a negligible role
in adsorbing hydrogen atom. This is verified by a series of single atom
catalysts comprising of PtN2 monolayer by replacing Pt atom with a TM (Fe, Co,
Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, or Ir) atom, or subsequent adsorbing a Cl atom. One of the
most promising materials is Pd@PtN2-Cl that offers superior HER activity, even
better than pure Pt. This work uncovers the nature of spin-activity
correlation, thus paving the way for the design of high-performance catalysts
through spin-engineering.

<h3>Hydride Units Filled B--C Clathrate: A New Pathway for High-Temperature  Superconductivity at Ambient Pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01656" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01656</a>

<i>Ying Sun, Li Zhu</i>
<br>
<br>
The pursuit of room-temperature superconductors has recently advanced with
the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides,
although sustaining the superconductivity of hydrides at ambient pressure
remains challenging. In parallel, $sp^3$-bonded frameworks comprising
lightweight elements (\textit{e.g.}, boron and carbon) have emerged as another
avenue for developing ambient-pressure superconductors. However, despite their
stability at low pressures, the critical temperature ($T_\text{c}$) values
observed in these materials have not yet reached the impressive benchmarks set
by hydride-based superconductors. Here we propose a novel design strategy for
achieving high-temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure by integrating
hydride units into B-C clathrate structures. This approach exploits the
beneficial properties of hydrogen, the lightest element, to enhance the
superconductivity beyond that of the parent compounds. For instance, our
computational predictions indicate that doping SrB$_3$C$_3$ with ammonium
(NH$_4$) yields a SrNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$ compound with an estimated $T_\text{c}$ of
73 K at ambient pressure -- more than double that of its precursor (31 K).
Extensive substitution across the periodic table results in a family of
MNHNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$ superconductors that are predicted to be superconducting at
ambient pressure. These compounds can potentially be synthesized using
high-pressure techniques and then quenched to ambient conditions, with the
highest predicted ambient-pressure $T_\text{c}$ of 86 K in PbNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$.
Our findings present a promising strategy for discovering high-$T_\text{c}$
superconductors at ambient pressure, potentially revolutionizing technologies
reliant on superconducting materials.

<h3>Numerical Investigations of the Extensive Entanglement Hamiltonian in  Quantum Spin Ladders</h3>

Entanglement constitutes one of the key concepts in quantum mechanics and
serves as an indispensable tool in the understanding of quantum many-body
systems. In this work, we perform extensive numerical investigations of
extensive entanglement properties of coupled quantum spin chains. This setup
has proven useful for e.g. extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to open
systems, and contrasts the majority of previous research where the entanglement
cut has one lower dimension than the system. We focus on the cases where the
entanglement Hamiltonian is either gapless or exhibits spontaneous symmetry
breaking behavior. We further employ conformal field theoretical formulae to
identify the universal behavior in the former case. The results in our work can
serve as a paradigmatic starting point for more systematic exploration of the
largely uncharted physics of extensive entanglement, both analytical and
numerical.

<h3>Cryogenic spin Peltier effect detected by a RuO$_2$-AlO$_x$ on-chip  microthermometer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01711</a>

<br>
<br>
We report electric detection of the spin Peltier effect (SPE) in a bilayer
consisting of a Pt film and a Y$_{3}$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) single crystal at the
cryogenic temperature $T$ as low as 2 K based on a RuO$_2$$-$AlO$_x$ on-chip
thermometer film. By means of a reactive co-sputtering technique, we
successfully fabricated RuO$_2$$-$AlO$_x$ films having a large temperature
coefficient of resistance (TCR) of $\sim 100\% ~\textrm{K}^{-1}$ at around
$2~\textrm{K}$. By using the RuO$_2$$-$AlO$_x$ film as an on-chip temperature
sensor for a Pt/YIG device, we observe a SPE-induced temperature change on the
order of sub-$\mu \textrm{K}$, the sign of which is reversed with respect to
the external magnetic field $B$ direction. We found that the SPE signal
gradually decreases and converges to zero by increasing $B$ up to
$10~\textrm{T}$. The result is attributed to the suppression of magnon
excitations due to the Zeeman-gap opening in the magnon dispersion of YIG,
whose energy much exceeds the thermal energy at 2 K.

<br>
<br>
We study the two-dimensional disordered topological superconductor with
Hubbard interactions. When the magnitude of the pairing potential is tuned to
special values, this interacting model is exactly solvable even when disorders
are imposed on the potential term or coupling constants. The topology of this
model is investigated in detail by the real space Chern number formula, which
computes the topological index of disordered systems to high precisions. It is
found that the disorders can drive the system from topological trivial phase to
a non-trivial phase, which generalizes the topological Anderson phenomena to
interacting models. The self-consistent Born approximation is also employed to
understand the influence of the disorders on the parameters of the interacting
topological superconductor. It provide an alternative way to understand the
topological transitions at weak disordered region.

<br>
The coexistence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order at room
temperature in single-phase van der Waals materials, particularly within the
two-dimensional limit, has attracted significant research interest.
Nonetheless, such materials are rare. In this work, we introduce an itinerant
van der Waals antiferromagnet (Fe0.56Co0.44)5GeTe2, where the ferromagnetic
order of its exfoliated flakes remains discernible up to room temperature,
extending down to the monolayer limit. A notable phenomenon observed is the
evident odd-even layer-number effect at high temperature (e.g., T = 150 K).
Such behaviour can be expounded by a linear-chain model. Of particular interest
is the robust ferromagnetic order observed in even-layer flakes at low
temperature (e.g., T = 2 K), which could potentially be attributed to
spin-polarized defects. The intricate interplay among magnetic field strength,
layer number, and temperature gives rise to a diverse array of phenomena,
holding promise not only for new physics but also for practical applications.

<h3>Impact of nuclear effects on the ultrafast dynamics of an  organic/inorganic mixed-dimensional interface</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electron dynamics at weakly bound interfaces of organic/inorganic materials
are easily influenced by large-amplitude nuclear motion. In this work, we
investigate the effects of different approximations to the equilibrium nuclear
distributions on the ultrafast charge-carrier dynamics of a laser-excited
hybrid organic/inorganic interface. By considering a prototypical system
consisting of pyrene physisorbed on a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, we analyze linear
absorption spectra, electronic density currents, and charge-transfer dynamics
induced by a femtosecond pulse in resonance with the frontier-orbital
transition in the molecule. The calculations are based on \textit{ab initio}
molecular dynamics with classical and quantum thermostats, followed by
time-dependent density-functional theory coupled to multi-trajectory Ehrenfest
dynamics. We impinge the system with a femtosecond (fs) pulse of a few hundred
GW/cm$^2$ intensity and propagate it for 100 fs. We find that the optical
spectrum is insensitive to different nuclear distributions in the energy range
dominated by the excitations localized on the monolayer. The pyrene resonance,
in contrast, shows a small blue shift at finite temperatures, hinting at an
electron-phonon-induced vibrational-level renormalization. The electronic
current density following the excitation is affected by classical and quantum
nuclear sampling through suppression of beating patterns and faster decay
times. Interestingly, finite temperature leads to a longer stability of the
ultrafast charge transfer after excitation. Overall, the results show that the
ultrafast charge-carrier dynamics are dominated by electronic rather than by
nuclear effects at the field strengths and time scales considered in this work.

<h3>Path-dependent correlations in dynamically tuned Ising models and its  short-time behavior: application of Magnus expansion</h3>

We study the buildup of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlation in the dynamically
tuned Ising models which are realized by the Rydberg atomic system. In
short-time scale, we apply Magnus expansion (ME) to derive the high-order
analytic expression of the connected correlation functions and compare it with
exactly numerical results for the different lattice geometries, e.g., 1D chain,
$2 \times n$ lattice, and $n \times n$ lattice. It is shown that the high-order
expansion is required to describe accurately the buildup of AF correlation in
the quench dynamics. Moreover, through a 2D square lattice, we find that the
magnitude of AF correlation for the same Manhattan distance is proportional to
the number of the shortest paths in a sufficiently long time until long and
distinct paths are involved significantly with the buildup of the correlation.
Finally, we propose an applicable experimental setup to realize our findings.

A unique attribute of atomically thin quantum materials is the in-situ
tunability of their electronic band structure by externally controllable
parameters like electrostatic doping, electric field, strain, electron
interactions, and displacement or twisting of atomic layers. This unparalleled
control of the electronic bands has led to the discovery of a plethora of
exotic emergent phenomena. But despite its key role, there is currently no
versatile method for mapping the local band structure in advanced 2D materials
devices in which the active layer is commonly embedded in various insulating
layers and metallic gates. Utilizing a scanning superconducting quantum
interference device, we image the de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations in a
model system, the Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene with dual gates, which
displays multiple highly-tunable bands. By resolving thermodynamic quantum
oscillations spanning over 100 Landau levels in low magnetic fields, we
reconstruct the band structure and its controllable evolution with the
displacement field with unprecedented precision and spatial resolution of 150
nm. Moreover, by developing Landau level interferometry, we reveal
shear-strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields and map their spatial dependence. In
contrast to artificially-induced large strain, which leads to pseudomagnetic
fields of hundreds of Tesla, we detect naturally occurring pseudomagnetic
fields as low as 1 mT corresponding to graphene twisting by just 1 millidegree
over one {\mu}m distance, two orders of magnitude lower than the typical angle
disorder in high-quality twisted bilayer graphene devices. This ability to
resolve the local band structure and strain on the nanoscale opens the door to
the characterization and utilization of tunable band engineering in practical
van der Waals devices.

<br>
The Haldane-Hubbard model is a prime example of the combined effects of band
topology and electronic interaction. We revisit its spinful phase diagram at
half-filling as a consensus on the presence of SU($2$) symmetry is currently
lacking. To start, we utilize the Hartree-Fock mean-field method, which offers
a direct understanding of symmetry breaking through the effective mass term
that can acquire spin dependence. Our results, in agreement with previous
studies, provide an instructive insight into the regime where the Chern number
$C=1$, with only one spin species remaining topological. Besides that, we
numerically study the phase diagram of the Haldane-Hubbard model via a
large-scale infinite-density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) method. The
phase boundaries are determined by the Chern number and the correlation lengths
obtained from the transfer-matrix spectrum. Unlike previous studies, the iDMRG
method investigates the Haldane-Hubbard model on a thin and infinitely long
cylinder and examines scenarios consistent with the two-dimensional
thermodynamic limit. Here, the phase diagram we obtained qualitatively goes
beyond the Hartree-Fock scope, particularly in the $C=1$ region, and serves as
a quantitative benchmark for further theoretical and experimental
investigations.

<br>
<br>
$\rm{PtSe_2}$ is a van der Waals material transiting from an indirect
semiconductor to a semimetal with increasing thickness. Its absorption
threshold has been conjectured to originate from interband indirect
transitions. By quantitative comparison between wideband optical absorption
($0.8 - 3.0\,\rm{eV}$) of high-quality exfoliated crystals and ab-initio
simulations, we prove instead that the optical absorption arises only from
direct transitions. This understanding allows us to revisit the semiconductor
to semimetal transition and to explore the effect of stacking and excitons on
optical absorption.

Frustration-induced strong quantum fluctuations accompanied by spin-orbit
coupling and crystal electric field can give rise to rich and diverse magnetic
phenomena associated with unconventional low-energy excitations in rare-earth
based quantum magnets. Herein, we present crystal structure, magnetic
susceptibility, specific heat, muon spin relaxation(muSR), and electron spin
resonance (ESR) studies on the polycrystalline samples of Ba6Yb2Ti4O17 in which
Yb3+ ions constitute a perfect triangular lattice in ab-plane without
detectable anti-site disorder between atomic sites. The Curie-Weiss fit of
low-temperature magnetic susceptibility data suggest the spin-orbit entangled
Jeff = 1/2 degrees of freedom of Yb3+ spin with weak antiferromagnetic exchange
interactions in the Kramers doublet ground state. The zero-field specific heat
data reveal the presence of long-range magnetic order at TN = 77 mK which is
suppressed in a magnetic field 1 T. The broad maximum in specific heat is
attributed to the Schottky anomaly implying the Zeeman splitting of the Kramers
doublet ground state. The ESR measurements suggest the presence of anisotropic
exchange interaction between the moments of Yb3+ spins and the well separated
Kramers doublet state. muSR experiments reveal a fluctuating state of Yb3+
spins in the temperature range 0.1 K-100 K owing to depopulation of crystal
electric field levels, which suggests that the Kramers doublets are well
separated consistent with thermodynamic and ESR results. In addition to the
intraplane nearest-neighbor superexchange interaction, the interplane exchange
interaction and anisotropy are expected to stabilize the long-range ordered
state in this triangular lattice antiferromagnet.

FeCrAl ODS steels for accident tolerant fuel claddings are designed to bear
high-Cr and Al for enhancing oxidation resistance. In this study, we
investigated the effects of Cr content on ion-irradiation hardening of three
ODS ferritic steels with different Cr contents added with 9 wt\% Al, Fe12Cr9Al
(SP12), Fe15Cr9Al (SP13), and Fe18Cr9Al (SP14). The specimens were irradiated
with 6.4MeV Fe\textsuperscript{3+} at 300 \textdegree C to nominal 3 dpa. The
irradiation hardening was measured by nanoindentation method, and the Nix-Gao
plots were used to evaluate the bulk-equivalent hardness. The results showed
that the irradiation hardening decreased with increasing Cr content. The reason
is due to the growth of dislocation loops hindered by solute Cr atoms. TEM
observations showed both $\langle 100\rangle$ and $1/2\langle 111\rangle$
dislocation loops existed in the irradiated area. The irradiation hardening was
estimated by dispersed barrier hardening (DBH) model with dislocation loops.

<h3>Topological phases of strongly-interacting time-reversal invariant  topological superconducting chains under a magnetic field</h3>

Using the density-matrix renormalization group, we determine the different
topological phases and low-energy excitations of a time-reversal invariant
topological superconducting (TRITOPS) wire with extended s-wave
superconductivity, Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and on-site repulsion $U$,
under an externally applied Zeeman field $J$. For the case in which $J$ is
perpendicular to the SOC, the model describes a chain of Shiba impurities on
top of a superconductor with extended superconductor pairing. We identify the
different topological phases of the model at temperature $T=0$, and in
particular study the stability of the TRITOPS phase against the Zeeman field
$J$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, for different values of $U$. In the case
where the magnetic field $J$ is perpendicular to the SOC axis, the pair of
Kramers-degenerate Majorana zero modes at the edges of the system that exist
for $J=0$, remain degenerate until a critical value of the magnetic field is
reached. For $J$ parallel to the SOC and up to moderate values of $U$, the
fractional spin projection $\langle S_y \rangle=1/4$ at the ends, found for
non-interacting wires at $U=0$, is recovered. In addition, the analytic
expression that relates $\langle S_y \rangle$ with $J$ for finite
non-interacting chains is shown to be universal up to moderate values of $U$.

<br>

The Shuttleworth equation: a linear stress-strain relation ubiquitously used
in modeling the behavior of soft surfaces. Its validity in the realm of
materials subject to large deformation is a topic of current debate. Here, we
zoom out to derive the constitutive behavior of the surface from the general
framework of finite kinematics. We distinguish cases of finite and
infinitesimal surface relaxation prior to an infinitesimal applied deformation.
The Shuttleworth equation identifies as the Cauchy stress measure in the fully
linearized setting. We show that in both finite and linearized cases, measured
elastic constants depend on the utilized stress measure. In addition, we
discuss the physical implications of our results and analyze the magnitude of
surface relaxation in the light of two different test cases.

<h3>Purcell-Enhanced Single-Photon Emission in the Telecom C-Band</h3>

<br>
<br>
Purcell-enhanced quantum dot single-photon emission in the telecom C-band
from InAs quantum dots inside circular Bragg grating cavities is shown. The
InAs quantum dots are grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy on an InP
substrate and are embedded into a quaternary
$\mathrm{In}_{0.53}\mathrm{Al}_{0.23}\mathrm{Ga}_{0.24}\mathrm{As}$ membrane
structure. In a post-growth flip-chip process with subsequent substrate removal
and electron beam-lithography, circular Bragg grating ("bullseye") resonators
are defined. Micro-photoluminescence studies of the devices at cryogenic
temperatures of T = 5 K reveal individual quantum dot emission lines into a
pronounced cavity mode. Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements
under above-band gap excitation yield Purcell-enhanced excitonic decay times of
$\tau = (180 \pm 3)$ ps corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P = (6.7 \pm
0.6)$. Pronounced photon antibunching with a background limited $g^{(2)}(0) =
(0.057 \pm 0.004)$ is observed, which demonstrates that the light originated
mostly from one single quantum dot.

<h3>From conductance viewed as transmission to resistance viewed as  reflection. An extension of Landauer quantum paradigm to the classical case  at finite temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01942" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01942</a>
<br>
<i>Lino Reggiani, Eleonora Alfinito, Federico Intini</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we present an extension of Landauer paradigm, conductance is
transmission, to the case of macroscopic classical conductors making use of a
description of conductance and resistance based on the application of the
fluctuation dissipation (FD) theorem. The main result is summarized in the
expressions below for conductance $G$ and resistance $R$ at thermodynamic
equilibrium, with the usual meaning of symbols. $G$ is given in terms of the
variance of total carrier number fluctuations between two ideal transparent
contacts in an open system described by a grand canonical ensemble as
$$ G =\frac{e^2 \overline{v_x'^2} \tau}{L^2 K_BT} \overline{\delta N^2} %=
\frac{e^2 \sqrt{\overline{v_x'^2}} \Gamma }{L K_BT} \overline{\delta %N^2} %=
\frac{e^2 \overline{N} \Gamma } {Lm\sqrt{\overline{v_x'^2}}} \ \ \ \ $$
By contrast $R$ is given in terms of the variance of carrier drift-velocity
fluctuations due to the instantaneous carrier specular reflection at the
internal contact interfaces of a closed system described by a canonical
ensemble as
$$ R= \frac{(m L)^2}{e^2 K_BT \tau} \overline{\delta v_d^2} %= \frac
{Lm\sqrt{\overline{v_x'^2}}} {e^2 \overline{N} \Gamma } $$
The FD approach gives evidence of the duality property of conductance related
to transmission and resistance related to reflection. Remarkably, the
expressions above are shown to recover the quantum Landauer paradigm in the
limit of zero temperature for a one-dimensional conductor.

Switching interacting particle systems studied in probability theory are the
stochastic processes of hopping particles on a lattice consisting of slow
particles and fast particles, where the switching between these two types of
particles happens randomly with a given transition rate. In the present paper,
we show that such stochastic processes of many particles are useful in modeling
group behaviors of ants. Recently the situation-depending switching between two
distinct types of primarily relied cues for ants in selecting foraging paths
has been experimentally studied by the research group of the last author of
this paper. We propose a discrete-time interacting random-walk model on a
square lattice, in which two kinds of hopping rules are included. We report the
numerical simulation results which exhibit the global changes in selected
homing paths from trailing paths of the `pheromone road' to
nearly-optimal-paths depending on the switching parameters. By introducing two
kinds of order parameters characterizing the switching-parameter dependence of
homing-duration distributions, we discuss such global changes as phase
transitions realized in path selections of ants. Critical phenomena associated
with the continuous phase transitions are also studied.

<h3>Emergence of odd elasticity in a microswimmer using deep reinforcement  learning</h3>

<br>

We investigate the emergence of odd elasticity in an elastic microswimmer
model by using Deep Q-Network with a reinforcement learning method. Although
the swimming velocity decreases for an elastic microswimmer with prescribed
dynamics in the large-frequency regime, the fully trained elastic microswimmer
adapts a waiting strategy to avoid the velocity decrease. For the trained
microswimmers, we evaluate the performance of the cycles by the product of the
loop area (called non-reciprocality) and the loop frequency, and show that the
average swimming velocity is proportional to the performance. By calculating
the force-displacement correlations, we obtain the effective odd elasticity of
the microswimmer to characterize its non-reciprocal dynamics. The emergent odd
elasticity is closely related to the loop frequency of the cyclic deformation.
The present work provides us with a clue to reveal the emergence of various
non-reciprocal phenomena in active systems by using machine learning.

Charges and their contribution to protein-protein interactions are essential
for the key structural and dynamic properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb)
solutions. In fact, they influence the apparent molecular weight, the static
structure factor, the collective diffusion coefficient or the relative
viscosity and their concentration dependence. Further, charges play an
important role in the colloidal stability of mAbs. There exist standard
experimental tools to characterise mAb net charges such as the measurement of
the electrophoretic mobility, the second virial coefficient, or the diffusion
interaction parameter. However, the resulting values are difficult to be
directly related to the actual overall net charge of the antibody and to
theoretical predictions based on its known molecular structure. Here, we report
the results of a systematic investigation of the solution properties of a
charged IgG1 mAb as a function of concentration and ionic strength using a
combination of electrophoretic measurements, static and dynamic light
scattering, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and tracer particle-based
microrheology. We analyse and interpret the experimental results using
established colloid theory and coarse-grained computer simulations. We discuss
the potential and limits of colloidal models for the description of interaction
effects of charged mAbs, in particular pointing out the importance of
incorporating shape and charge anisotropy when attempting to predict structural
and dynamic solution properties at high concentrations.

Although density functional theory (DFT) has aided in accelerating the
discovery of new materials, such calculations are computationally expensive,
especially for high-throughput efforts. This has prompted an explosion in
exploration of machine learning assisted techniques to improve the
computational efficiency of DFT. In this study, we present a comprehensive
investigation of the broader application of Finetuna, an active learning
framework to accelerate structural relaxation in DFT with prior information
from Open Catalyst Project pretrained graph neural networks. We explore the
challenges associated with out-of-domain systems: alcohol ($C_{>2}$) on metal
surfaces as larger adsorbates, metal-oxides with spin polarization, and
three-dimensional (3D) structures like zeolites and metal-organic-frameworks.
By pre-training machine learning models on large datasets and fine-tuning the
model along the simulation, we demonstrate the framework's ability to conduct
relaxations with fewer DFT calculations. Depending on the similarity of the
test systems to the training systems, a more conservative querying strategy is
applied. Our best-performing Finetuna strategy reduces the number of DFT
single-point calculations by 80% for alcohols and 3D structures, and 42% for
oxide systems.

<br>
<br>
The proximity effect of superconductivity on confined states in
semiconductors gives rise to various bound states such as Andreev bound states
(ABSs), Andreev molecules and Majorana zero modes. While such bound states do
not conserve charge, their Fermion parity is a good quantum number. One way to
measure parity is to convert it to charge first, which is then sensed. In this
work, we sense the charge of ABSs and Andreev molecules in an InSb-Al hybrid
nanowire using an integrated quantum dot operated as a charge sensor. We show
how charge sensing measurements can resolve the even and odd states of an
Andreev molecule, without affecting the parity. Such an approach can be further
utilized for parity measurements of Majorana zero modes in Kitaev chains based
on quantum dots.

<br>
<i>Matthias Hecker, Rafael M. Fernandes</i>
<br>
<br>
In the fluctuation regime that precedes the onset of pairing in
multi-component superconductors, such as nematic and chiral superconductors,
the normal state is generally unstable towards the formation of charge-$4e$
order $-$ an exotic quantum state in which electrons form coherent quartets
rather than Cooper pairs. However, charge-$4e$ order is often suppressed by
other competing composite orders, such as nematics. Importantly, the formation
of nematic domains is unavoidable due to the long-range strains generated,
leading to one-dimensional regions where the competing nematic order is
suppressed. Here, we employ a real-space variational approach to demonstrate
that, in such nematic domain walls, charge-$4e$ order is locally condensed via
a vestigial-order mechanism. We explore the experimental manifestations of this
effect and discuss materials in which it can be potentially observed.

Random matrix theory allows for the deduction of stability criteria for
complex systems using only a summary knowledge of the statistics of the
interactions between components. As such, results like the well-known
elliptical law are applicable in a myriad of different contexts. However, it is
often assumed that all components of the complex system in question are
statistically equivalent, which is unrealistic in many applications. Here, we
introduce the concept of a finely-structured random matrix. These are random
matrices with element-specific statistics, which can be used to model systems
in which the individual components are statistically distinct. By supposing
that the degree of `fine structure' in the matrix is small, we arrive at a
succinct `modified' elliptical law. We demonstrate the direct applicability of
our results to the niche and cascade models in theoretical ecology, as well as
a model of a neural network, and a directed network with arbitrary degree
distribution. The simple closed form of our central results allow us to draw
broad qualitative conclusions about the effect of fine structure on stability.

<br>
A large body of literature within the additive manufacturing (AM) community
has focused on successfully creating stable tungsten (W) microstructures due to
significant interest in its application for extreme environments. However,
solidification cracking and additional embrittling features at grain boundaries
have resulted in poorly performing microstructures, stymying the application of
AM as a manufacturing technique for W. Several alloying strategies, such as
ceramic particles and ductile elements, have emerged with the promise to
eliminate solidification cracking while simultaneously enhancing stability
against recrystallization. In this work, we provide new insights regarding the
defects and microstructural features that result from the introduction of ZrC
for grain refinement and NiFe as a ductile reinforcement phase - in addition to
the resulting thermophysical and mechanical properties. ZrC is shown to promote
microstructural stability with increased hardness due to the formation of ZrO2
dispersoids. Conversely, NiFe forms into micron-scale FCC phase regions within
a BCC W matrix, producing enhanced toughness relative to pure AM W. A
combination of these effects is realized in the WNiFe+ZrC system and
demonstrates that complex chemical environments coupled with the tuning of AM
microstructures provides an effective pathway for enabling laser AM W materials
with enhanced stability and performance.

<br>
We propose a data-driven framework for identifying coarse-grained (CG)
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential parameters in confined systems for simple liquids.
Our approach involves the use of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that is trained to
approximate the solution of the Inverse Liquid State (ILST) problem for
confined systems. The DNN model inherently incorporates essential physical
characteristics specific to confined fluids, enabling accurate prediction of
inhomogeneity effects. By utilizing transfer learning, we predict single-site
LJ potentials of simple multiatomic liquids confined in a slit-like channel,
which effectively replicate both the fluid structure and molecular force of the
target All-Atom (AA) system when the electrostatic interactions are not
dominant. In addition, we showcase the synergy between the data-driven approach
and the well-known Bottom-Up coarse-graining method utilizing Relative-Entropy
(RE) Minimization. Through sequential utilization of these two methods, the
robustness of the iterative RE method is significantly augmented, leading to a
remarkable enhancement in convergence.
