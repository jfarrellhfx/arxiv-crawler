<h3>Biophysical Fluid Dynamics in a Petri Dish</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08374</a>

<i>George T. Fortune, Eric Lauga, Raymond E. Goldstein</i>
<p>The humble Petri dish is perhaps the simplest setting in which to examine the
locomotion of swimming organisms, particularly those whose body size is tens of
microns to millimetres. The fluid layer in such a container has a bottom
no-slip surface and a stress-free upper boundary. It is of fundamental interest
to understand the flow fields produced by the elementary and composite
singularities of Stokes flow in this geometry. Building on the few particular
cases that have previously been considered in the literature, we study here the
image systems for the primary singularities of Stokes flow subject to such
boundary conditions - the stokeslet, rotlet, source, rotlet dipole, source
dipole and stresslet - paying particular attention to the far-field behavior.
In several key situations, the depth-averaged fluid flow is accurately captured
by the solution of an associated Brinkman equation whose screening length is
proportional to the depth of the fluid layer. The case of hydrodynamic bound
states formed by spinning microswimmers near a no-slip surface, discovered
first using the alga $Volvox$, is reconsidered in the geometry of a Petri dish,
where the power-law attractive interaction between microswimmers acquires
unusual exponentially screened oscillations.

<h3>Quasicrystalline Spin Liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07971" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07971</a>
<br>
<i>Sunghoon Kim, Mohammad Saad, Dan Mao, Adhip Agarwala, Debanjan Chowdhury</i>
<p>The interplay of electronic interactions and frustration in crystalline
systems leads to a panoply of correlated phases, including exotic Mott
insulators with non-trivial patterns of entanglement. Disorder introduces
additional quantum interference effects that can drive localization phenomena.
Quasicrystals, which are neither disordered nor perfectly crystalline, are
interesting playgrounds for studying the effects of interaction, frustration,
and quantum interference. Here we consider a solvable example of a quantum spin
liquid on a tri-coordinated quasicrystal. We extend Kitaev's original
construction for the spin model to our quasicrystalline setting and perform a
large scale flux-sampling to find the ground-state configuration in terms of
the emergent majorana fermions and flux excitations. This reveals a fully
gapped quantum spin liquid, regardless of the exchange anisotropies,
accompanied by a tendency towards non-trivial (de-)localization at the edge and
the bulk. The advent of moir\'e materials and a variety of quantum simulators
provide a new platform to bring phases of quasicrystalline quantum matter to
life in a controlled fashion.

<h3>Superconductivity in atomically thin films: 2D critical state model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07973</a>
<br>
<i>Filippo Gaggioli, Gianni Blatter, Kostya S. Novoselov, Vadim B. Geshkenbein</i>
<p>The comprehensive understanding of superconductivity is a multi-scale task
that involves several levels, starting from the electronic scale determining
the microscopic mechanism, going to the phenomenological scale describing
vortices and the continuum-elastic scale describing vortex matter, to the
macroscopic scale relevant in technological applications. The prime example for
such a macro-phenomenological description is the Bean model that is hugely
successful in describing the magnetic and transport properties of bulk
superconducting devices. Motivated by the development of novel devices based on
superconductivity in atomically thin films, such as twisted-layer graphene,
here, we present a simple macro-phenomenological description of the critical
state in such two-dimensional (2D) thin films. While transverse screening and
demagnetization can be neglected in these systems, thereby simplifying the task
in comparison with usual film- and platelet shaped samples, surface and bulk
pinning are important elements to be included. We use our 2D critical state
model to describe the transport and magnetic properties of 2D thin-film
devices, including the phenomenon of non-reciprocal transport in devices with
asymmetric boundaries and the superconducting diode effect.

<h3>Stochastic Integration of the Cahn-Hilliard Phase Field Equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08034</a>
<br>
<i>Qianran Yu, Nicholas Julian, Jaime Marian, Enrique Martinez</i>
<p>In this work we develop a stochastic algorithm to integrate the Cahn-Hilliard
equations. The algorithm is based on Gillespie's stochastic simulation
algorithm, also known as kinetic Monte Carlo. The deterministic integration of
the phase field equations leads to the closest minimum of free energy and does
not overcome free energy barriers. However, in the nucleation and growth regime
of the phase diagram, free energy barriers need to be thermally overcome for
the system to phase separate to reach equilibrium. We show in this work that
the proposed stochastic integration algorithm indeed allows the system to
overcome free energy barriers. We discuss the results in terms of fluctuation
distributions, grid sizes and efficiency.

<h3>Compressive-Sensing-Enhanced First-Principles Calculation of  Photoluminescence Spectra in Color Centers: A Comparison between Theory and  Experiment for the G Center in Silicon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08067" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08067</a>
<br>
<i>Jiongzhi Zheng, Lukasz Komza, Yihuang Xiong, Natalya Sheremetyeva, Changpeng Lin, Sin√©ad M. Griffin, Alp Sipahigil, Geoffroy Hautier</i>
<p>Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are a versatile tool for exploring the
electronic and optical properties of quantum defect systems. In this work, we
investigate the PL spectra of the G center in silicon by combining
first-principles computations with a machine-learned compressive-sensing
technique and experiment. We show that the compressive-sensing technique
provides a speed up of approximately 20 times compared with the
finite-displacement method with similar numerical accuracy. We compare theory
and experiment and show good agreement for the historically proposed
configuration B of the G center. In particular, we attribute the experimentally
observed E-line of the G center to a local vibration mode mainly involving two
substitutional C atoms and one interstitial Si atom. Our theoretical results
also well reproduce and explain the experimental E-line energy shifts
originating from the carbon isotopic effect. In addition, our results
demonstrate that some highly anharmonic modes that are apparent in computed
spectra could be absent experimentally because of their short lifetime. Our
work not only provides a deeper understanding of the G-center defect but also
paves the way to accelerate the calculation of PL spectra for color centers.

<h3>Continuum of magnetic excitations in the Kitaev honeycomb iridate  D$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$</h3>

<p>Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements of powder
D$_3(^{7}$Li)($^{193}$Ir)$_2$O$_6$ reveal low energy magnetic excitations with
a scattering cross section that is broad in $|Q|$ and consistent with a Kitaev
spin-liquid (KSL) state. The magnetic nature of the excitation spectrum is
demonstrated by longitudinally polarized neutron studies. The total magnetic
moment of 1.7(2)$\mu_B$/Ir inferred from the total magnetic scattering cross
section is consistent with the effective moment inferred from magnetic
susceptibility data and expectations for the $J_{\rm eff}=1/2$ single ion
state. The rise in the dynamic correlation function ${\cal S}(Q,\omega)$ for
$\hbar\omega<5~$meV can be described by a nearest-neighbor Kitaev model with
interaction strength $K\approx-13(5)$~meV. Exchange disorder associated with
the mixed D-Li site could play an important role in stabilizing the low $T$
quantum fluctuating state.

<h3>Nonperturbative Simulation of Anharmonic Rattler Dynamics in Type-I  Clathrates with Vibrational Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08087" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08087</a>
<br>
<i>Dipti Jasrasaria, Timothy C. Berkelbach</i>
<p>We use vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to study the
vibrational structure of type-I clathrate solids, specifically
X$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where X=Ba,Sr. These materials are cage-like chemical
structures hosting loosely bound guest atoms, resulting in strong
anharmonicity, short phonon lifetimes, and ultra-low thermal conductivities.
Presenting the methodological developments necessary for this first application
to three-dimensional, atomistic materials, we validate our approach through
comparison to molecular dynamics simulations and show that VDMFT is extremely
accurate at a fraction of the cost. We find that anharmonicity causes rattler
modes to shift up in frequency by 50% (10 cm$^{-1}$) and to have lifetimes of
less than 1 ps. Furthermore, we analyze the phonon self-energy and find that
anharmonicity mixes guest rattling modes and cage acoustic modes, significantly
changing the character of the harmonic phonons.

<h3>High Pressure Suppression of Plasticity due to Over-Nucleation of Shear  Strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08104" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08104</a>
<br>
<i>Brenden W. Hamilton, Timothy C. Germann</i>
<p>High pressure shear band formation is a critical phenomenon in energetic
materials due to its influence on both mechanical strength and mechanochemical
activation. While shear banding is know to occur in a variety of these
materials, the governing dynamics of the mechanisms is not well defined for
molecular crystals. We conduct molecular dynamics simulations of shock wave
induced shear band formation in the energetic material
1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) to assess shear band nucleation
processes. We find, that at high pressures, the initial formation sites for
shear bands 'over-nucleate' and rapidly lower deviatoric stresses prior to
shear band formation and growth. This results in the suppression of plastic
deformation. A local cluster analysis is used to quantify and contrast this
mechanism with a more typical shear banding seen at lower pressures. These
results demonstrate a mechanism that is reversible in nature and that
supersedes shear band formation at increased pressures. We anticipate that
these results will have a broad impact on the modeling and development of high
strain rate application materials such as those for high explosives and
hypersonic systems.

<h3>Topological excitations in a spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein  condensate under sinusoidally varying magnetic fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08118" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08118</a>
<br>
<i>Arpana Saboo, Soumyadeep Halder, Subrata Das, Sonjoy Majumder</i>
<p>We present a theoretical study of a spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate under the influence of sinusoidally varying magnetic fields. In the
ground state of the ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate, we investigate topological
excitations in the system arising due to the combined effect of Rashba
spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane sinusoidally varying magnetic field. In
this work, we offer a comparative study for various choices of magnetic fields
in the $x\rm{-}y$ plane. For a fixed field strength, the spin-orbit coupled
system sustains a rich variety of exotic vortex structures ranging from
vortex-antivortex lattices to vortex clusters as we increase the coupling
strength.

<h3>Comparative study on high temperature mechanical behavior in 3YTZP  containing SWCNTs or MWCNTs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08130" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08130</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Castillo-Rodr√≠guez, Antonio Mu√±oz, Arturo Dom√≠nguez-Rodr√≠guez</i>
<p>Effects on mechanical properties of the presence of either single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in a 3YTZP
matrix have been investigated in this work. Thus, monolithic 3YTZP and 3YTZP
containing 2.5 vol% either SWCNTs or MWCNTs were fabricated by Spark Plasma
Sintering (SPS) at 1250 C. Samples were crept at temperatures between 1100 and
1200 C and stresses between 5 and 230 MPa. Raman spectroscopy measurements
indicate the absence of severe damages in the CNTs structure after sintering
and testing. Scanning electron microscopy studies show that microstructures do
not evolve during creep tests. Mechanical results point out that monolithic
3YTZP exhibits a higher creep resistance than composites since CNTs facilitate
grain boundary sliding during high-temperature deformation. SWCNTs and MWCNTs
have a similar effect on the high temperature mechanical behavior in 3YTZP
where the bundle length and the level of dispersion of CNTs play a crucial
role.

<h3>Effect of electron-phonon coupling on thermal transport in metals: a  Monte Carlo approach for solving the coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann  transport equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08150</a>
<br>
<i>Jie Peng, W. Ryan Deskins, Maria Helena Braga, Anter El-Azab</i>
<p>In this work, the effect of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling on both electron
and phonon transport of metals is investigated via first principles
calculations. A Monte-Carlo (MC) approach for solving the coupled
electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equations is developed to investigate
thermal conductivity of metals. In this approach, the anisotropic electron band
structure, phonon dispersion in the full Brillouin zone, and mode-dependent
thermal relaxation time of electrons and phonons are calculated from first
principles. Using this approach, MC simulations of coupled e-ph thermal
transport at different temperatures in {\alpha}-U and Ag are performed. These
two materials were selected as a way to demonstrate the applicability of the
method in different fields. The results indicate that the electron relaxation
time due to phonon scattering is orders of magnitude smaller than the phonon
relaxation time due to electron scattering. The results also show that, in
phonon thermal transport, the impact of ph-e scattering is almost negligible
and the ph-ph scattering dominates phonon transport. At high temperature, the
electrons dominate thermal transport in both {\alpha}-U and Ag. However, at low
temperature, the phonon contribution to the total thermal conductivity of
{\alpha}-U is significant. Moreover, the Lorenz ratio deviates from the
Sommerfeld value at low to intermediate temperatures, where the Wiedemann-Franz
law is not applicable. Finally, we show that the Ag electronic thermal
conductivity shows a stronger size effect than its phonon thermal conductivity.

<h3>Rational Design of Efficient Defect-Based Quantum Emitters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08257</a>
<br>
<i>Mark E. Turiansky, Kamyar Parto, Galan Moody, Chris G. Van de Walle</i>
<p>Single-photon emitters are an essential component of quantum networks, and
defects or impurities in semiconductors are a promising platform to realize
such quantum emitters. Here we present a model that encapsulates the essential
physics of coupling to phonons, which governs the behavior of real
single-photon emitters, and critically evaluate several approximations that are
commonly utilized. Emission in the telecom wavelength range is highly
desirable, but our model shows that nonradiative processes are greatly enhanced
at these low photon energies, leading to a decrease in efficiency. Our results
suggest that reducing the phonon frequency is a fruitful avenue to enhance the
efficiency.

<h3>Crossed Andreev Reflection in altermagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08263" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08263</a>
<br>
<i>Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori</i>
<p>Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a scattering phenomenon occurring in
superconductors (SCs) connected to two metallic leads, where an incident
electron on one side of the SC emerges on the opposite side as a hole. Despite
its significance, CAR detection is often impeded by the prevalent electron
tunneling (ET), where electrons exit on the opposing side. One approach to
augment CAR over ET involves employing two antiparallel ferromagnets across the
SC. However, this method is constrained by the low polarization in ferromagnets
and necessitates the application of a magnetic field. Altermagnets (AMs)
present a promising avenue for detecting and enhancing CAR due to their
distinct Fermi surfaces for each spin. Here, we propose a novel configuration
utilizing two AMs rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to each other on either
side of an SC to enhance CAR. We calculate local and nonlocal conductivities
across the AM-SC-AM junction using the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering approach.
Our findings reveal that in the strong phase of AMs, CAR overwhelmingly
dominates nonlocal transport. In the weak phase, CAR can exhibit significant
enhancement for larger values of the altermagnetic parameter compared to the
scenario where AMs are in the normal metallic phase. As a function of the
length of SC, the conductivities exhibit oscillations reminiscent of
Fabry-P\'erot interference.

<h3>Tuning residual stress, directional memory and aging in soft glassy  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08293" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08293</a>
<br>
<i>Paolo Edera, Minaspi Bantawa, Stefano Aime, Roger T Bonnecaze, Michel Cloitre</i>
<p>When glassy materials are rapidly quenched from the liquid to the solid state
upon flow cessation or cooling, they solidify in an out-of-equilibrium
configuration, retaining the memory of the processing conditions for very long
times. This is the origin of various phenomena, such as residual stresses and
directional memory, which greatly affect their properties. At the same time,
annealing the mechanical history encoded in disordered materials constitute a
great challenge. Here, we address this problem for the case of colloidal
glasses made of soft particles densely packed at a high volume fraction, using
experiments and particle dynamic simulations. We demonstrate that periodically
training soft particle glasses with a sequence of stress-controlled
oscillations successfully anneals residual stress and directional memory when
the stress amplitude corresponds to the yield point. At the microscopic level,
annealing provides a fine tuning of the local distribution of the stress
carried by the particles. Through the simulations, we show that the first
moments of this distribution have precise physical meaning: the mean value of
the distribution corresponds to the macroscopic stress; the skewness carries
information about directional memory; and the standard deviation is related to
mechanical aging. The same methodology is successfully applied to silica gels
with thixotropic properties, suggesting that it is general and may be extended
to other classes of disordered materials.

<p>The relation between crystal symmetries, electron correlations, and
electronic structure steers the formation of a large array of unconventional
phases of matter, including magneto-electric loop currents and chiral
magnetism. Detection of such hidden orders is a major goal in condensed matter
physics. However, to date, nonstandard forms of magnetism with chiral
electronic ordering have been experimentally elusive. Here, we develop a theory
for symmetry-broken chiral ground states and propose a methodology based on
circularly polarized spin-selective angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy
to probe them. We exploit the archetypal quantum material Sr2RuO4 and reveal
spectroscopic signatures which, even though subtle, may be reconciled with the
formation of spin-orbital chiral currents at the material surface. As we shed
light on these chiral regimes, our findings pave the way for a deeper
understanding of ordering phenomena and unconventional magnetism.

<h3>Effect of Interface on Density and Elastic Moduli of  $\textbf{Al/C}_{60}$ Nanocomposites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08326" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08326</a>
<br>
<i>V.V. Reshetniak, A.V Aborkin, A.V. Filippov</i>
<p>The paper analyzes theoretically the influence of fullerenes on the
characteristics of $\mathrm{Al/C}_{60}$ composites. The molecular dynamics
method is used to study the dependences of density and stiffness constants on
the concentration of inclusions, and to calculate the values of the bulk and
shear moduli for isotropic polycrystalline nanocomposites. The analysis shows
that interfacial interaction significantly affects the properties of
nanocomposites. This effect can be taken into account within the framework of
the theory of heterogeneous media using the interphase layer model. The
properties of the interphase layer are determined by interfacial interaction
and can be calculated by approximating the results of molecular dynamics
calculations. Using assumptions about the simplified form of the two-particle
distribution function allows the interfacial interaction energy to be
calculated and the interphase layer properties to be assessed analytically. The
paper compares numerical results and analytical estimates, and discusses the
validity of the approximations used. The analysis performed on the example of
an $\mathrm{Al/C}_{60}$ composite material demonstrates the feasibility of
using the analytical model of the interphase layer to estimate the effective
density and elastic moduli of heterogeneous media with nano-inhomogeneities.

<i>Jan Homberg, Alexander Weismann, Richard Berndt</i>
<p>Lead phthalocyanine (PbPc), a non-planar molecule, is studied on Pb(100)
using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. A rigid shift of the molecular orbitals
is found between molecules with the central Pb ion pointing to
(PbPc$\downarrow$) or away (PbPc$\uparrow$) from the substrate and understood
from the interaction between the molecules and their image charges. Inside the
superconducting energy gap, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonances are observed for
PbPc$\uparrow$ molecules in islands indicating the presence of a magnetic
moment. Such bound states are neither present on PbPc$\downarrow$ molecules nor
isolated PbPc$\uparrow$ or molecules that lost the Pb ion during deposition
(H$_0$Pc). The YSR energies vary depending on the orientation and type of the
molecular neighbors. We analyze the role of the out-of-plane dipole moment of
PbPc.

<p>Quantum gases of doubly-polar molecules represent appealing frameworks for a
variety of cross-disciplinary applications, encompassing quantum simulation and
computation, controlled quantum chemistry and precision measurements. Through a
joint experimental and theoretical study, here we explore a novel class of
ultracold paramagnetic polar molecules combining lithium alkali and chromium
transition metal elements. Focusing on the specific bosonic isotopologue
$^{6}$Li$^{53}$Cr, leveraging on the Fermi statistics of the parent atomic
mixture and on suitable Feshbach resonances recently discovered, we produce up
to $50\times10^3$ ultracold LiCr molecules at peak phase-space densities
exceeding 0.1, prepared within the least-bound rotationless level of the LiCr
electronic $sextet$ ground state $X^6\Sigma^+$. We thoroughly characterize the
molecular gas, demonstrating the paramagnetic nature of LiCr dimers and the
precise control of their quantum state. We investigate their stability against
inelastic processes and identify a parameter region where pure LiCr samples
exhibit lifetimes exceeding 0.2 s. Parallel to this, we employ state-of-the-art
quantum-chemical calculations to predict the properties of LiCr ground and
excited electronic states. We identify efficient paths to coherently transfer
weakly-bound LiCr dimers to their absolute ground state, to deliver ultracold
gases of doubly-polar molecules with significant electric (3.3 D) and magnetic
($5\,\mu_\text{B}$) dipole moments.

<h3>Pressure-dependent bandgap study of MBE grown {CdO/MgO} short period SLs  using diamond anvil cell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08354" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08354</a>
<br>
<i>Abinash Adhikari, Pawel Strak, Piotr Dluzewski, Agata Kaminska, Ewa Przezdziecka</i>
<p>Semiconductor superlattices have found widespread applications in electronic
industries. In this work, short-period superlattice structure (SLs) composed of
CdO and MgO layers was grown using the plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy
(PA-MBE) technique. The optical property of the SLs was investigated by
absorption measurement at room temperature. The ambient-pressure direct bandgap
was found to be 2.76 eV. The pressure dependence of fundamental bandgap has
been studied using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) technique. It has been found that
the band-to-band transition shifts toward higher energy with applied pressure.
The bandgap of SLs was varied from 2.76 eV to 2.87 eV with applied pressure
varied from 0 to 5.9 GPa. The pressure coefficient for the direct bandgap of
SLs was found to be 26 meV/GPa. The obtained experimental result was supported
by theoretical results obtained using DFT calculations. The volume deformation
potential was estimated using the empirical rule. We believe our findings may
provide valuable insight for a better understanding of {CdO/MgO} SLs towards
their future applications in optoelectronics.

<i>Arijit Maitra, M. P. Gururajan</i>
<p>Crystallographic twinning dynamics exhibit nanoscale force fluctuations that,
when probed by dynamic force spectroscopy, reveal the underlying interactions
within the lattice. We explore twinning in single crystalline titanium nickel,
a type of lattice instability mediated by a martensitic phase transition, which
creates mirror planes in the lattice. Exploiting the responses generated under
imposed strain ramps, we show that the dynamic force spectra of the twinning
rate process across various applied strain rates can be reconciled using a
statistical mechanics-based framework, demonstrating a more effective
utilisation of stochastic responses. The twinning mechanism is mapped onto a
free energy landscape to model the microscopic evolution of atomic
configurations under imposed time-dependent deformation. The framework enables
consistent inference of the relevant fundamental properties that define the
structural transition rate process. The study demonstrates how the statistical
characterisation of nanomechanical response-stimulus patterns can offer
microscopic insights into the deformation behaviours of crystalline materials.

<h3>Towards the Densest Polydisperse Disk Packing</h3>

<br>
<i>Sangwoo Kim, Sascha Hilgenfeldt</i>
<p>Understanding the way disordered particle packings transition between jammed
(rigid) and unjammed (fluid) states is of both great practical importance and
strong fundamental interest. The values of critical packing fraction (and other
state variables) at the jamming transition are known to be protocol dependent.
Here, we demonstrate that this variability at transition can be systematically
traced to structural measures of packing, as well as to energy measures inside
the jamming regime. Unlike annealing simulations from the fluid state, we use a
novel generalized simultaneous particle swap algorithm in the jammed regime to
construct states of desired energy, which upon decompression lead to
predictable critical packing fractions. Thus, jamming states with
extraordinarily high critical packing fraction can be found with little
computational effort. These states can sustain substantial shear strain and
preserve their special packing structure over the entire jammed domain. The
close relation revealed here between the energy landscape of overjammed
soft-particle packings and the behavior near the jamming transition points
towards new ways of understanding and constructing disordered materials with
exceptional properties.

<i>Xueqian Sun, Ermin Malic, Yuerui Lu</i>
<p>Highly customizable interfaces created by van der Waals stacked 2D materials
provide an extremely flexible opportunity for engineering and effectively
controlling material properties. The atomic-thin nature and strong scalability
of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the star family of two-dimensional
semiconducting materials, allow for the modulation of their inherent optical
and electrical characteristics by utilizing various environmental stimuli. In
such a material system, the stacking mechanism with spatial separation in the
structure enables recent observations of dipolar many-body complexes with the
interplay of multi-particles, leading to some exotic and novel excitonic
phenomena and enabling the closer study of high-correlated quantum physics. The
presence of powerful dipole-dipole interactions among long-lived interlayer
excitons can cause the system to enter unique classical and quantum phases with
multiparticle correlations, such as dipolar liquids, dipolar crystals and
superfluids. The strong binding energy of interlayer excitons in TMD-based
hetero-bilayers especially enhances the critical temperature of these exotic
phenomena. Here, we provide a concise summary of the recent frontier research
progress on dipolar complexes and many-body effects in TMD double layers,
encompassing fundamental theory and properties modulation. We reveal the
significance and current challenges of this research field and present the
potential developing directions of the hetero-bilayers in quantum physics and
quantum devices by adding new levels of external control or integration.

<h3>The breakdown of the direct relation between the density scaling  exponent and the intermolecular interaction potential for molecular systems  with purely repulsive intermolecular forces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08444" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08444</a>
<br>
<i>Filip Ka≈õkosz, Kajetan Koperwas, Andrzej Grzybowski, Marian Paluch</i>
<p>In this work, we question the generally accepted statement that the character
of intermolecular interactions can be directly determined from the scaling
exponent. Based on detailed studies of polyatomic molecular systems with
precisely defined and purely repulsive intermolecular potential, we show that
the value of the density scaling exponent evidently differs from the one
predicted by the intermolecular virial-potential-energy correlation. Since the
latter value directly results from the intermolecular potential, information on
the interactions between molecules within the system cannot be immediately
gained from the density scaling exponent value. Moreover, we suggest that the
recently proposed "molecular force" method also returns the value that varies
from the one scaling the dynamics. Finally, basing on our results, it might be
deduced that the intramolecular interactions influence the density scaling
value for real liquids.

<br>
<i>Ngoc Linh Nguyen, Hung The Dang, Tien Lam Pham, Thi Minh Hoa Nghiem</i>
<p>In this study, we employ a first-principles approach to conduct a
comprehensive investigation of the properties of nine common native point
defects in cubic boron nitride. This analysis combines standard semi-local and
dielectric hybrid density-exchange-correlation functional calculations,
encompassing vacancies, interstitials, antisites, and their complexes. Our
findings elucidate the influence of these defects on the structural and
electronic characteristics of cubic boron nitride, such as local structures,
formation energy, magnetism, and the energies of defect states within the band
gap. Notably, we accurately simulate the photoluminescent spectra of cubic
boron nitride induced by these defects, demonstrating excellent agreement with
experimental observations. This outcome indicates that the prominent peaks in
the photoluminescent spectrum at 2.5 and 2.8 eV can be attributed to the
nitrogen to boron antisite (N$_{\rm B}$) and boron interstitial (B$_{\rm i}$)
defects, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the energetic stability of
defects under various charge states, providing valuable references for
benchmarking purposes.

<h3>Solving Free Boundary Problems in Alloy Solidification under Universal  Cooling Conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08465" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08465</a>
<br>
<i>Chuanqi Zhu</i>
<p>The kinetics of interfaces in alloy solidification pose a classic free
boundary problem. This paper introduces an approach that amalgamates the
distinctive characteristics of sharp and diffuse interface models. The motion
of the diffuse interface is governed by the phase-field equation featuring a
traveling wave function [I. Steinbach, Modell. Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 17(7),
073001 (2009)]. To emulate solute rejection in the sharp interface model, the
concept of the middle-obstacle and the casting operation are employed.
Moreover, the undercooling along the interface normal is flattened to minimize
the impact of bulk undercooling in the interface and the associated effects,
such as stretching and arc-length diffusion. Notably, the results for interface
kinetics under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions closely
approximate their analytical solutions, all achieved with artificially wide
interfaces and comparatively low computational cost.

<i>Atri Goswami, Rohn Chatterjee, Sudip Mukherjee</i>
<p>We consider an inhomogeneous asymmetric exclusion processes in a closed
geometry with a point and an extended defects across which the hopping rates
are less than elsewhere. We study the stationary density profiles that result
from the competition between the point and extended defects. By using a minimum
current principle, we identify the conditions of the existence of a localised
shock or a localised domain wall. We further elucidate delocalisation of these
localised domain walls, when the strengths of the point and extended defects
follow a certain mutual relationship, which originates again from the minimum
current principle. We show that in that case the system admits a pair of
delocalised domain walls, none of which can penetrate the extended defect. We
calculate the fluctuation properties of the domain walls and obtain the long
time averaged shapes of the delocalised domain walls.

<h3>Electric field dependent thermal conductivity of relaxor ferroelectric  PMN-33PT through changes in the phonon spectrum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08516" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08516</a>
<br>
<i>Delaram Rashadfar, Brandi L. Wooten, Joseph P. Heremans</i>
<p>In ferroelectric materials, an applied electric field has been shown to
change the phonon dispersion relation sufficiently to alter the lattice thermal
conductivity, opening the theoretical possibility that a heat gradient could
drive a polarization flux, and technologically, also opening a new avenue
toward all solid-state heat switching. In this report, we confirm
experimentally the validity of the theory originally developed for Pb(Zr,Ti)O_3
(PZT) on the ferroelectric relaxor 0.66Pb[Mg_(1/3)Nb_(2/3)]O_3-0.33PbTiO_3
(PMN-33PT). In the theory, the relative change in sound velocity and thermal
conductivity with applied electric field relates to the piezoelectric
coefficients (d_33 and d_31) and the Gr\"uneisen parameter ({\gamma}). The
theory predicts that in PMN-33PT the effect should be an order of magnitude
larger, and of opposite sign as in PZT; this is confirmed here. The effect is
measured on samples that undergo multiple field sweep cycles and pass through 2
phase transitions. The thermal conductivity changes are closely linked to
variations in the piezoelectric coefficients. A null experiment on paraelectric
SrTiO_3 confirms the link between ferroelectricity and phonon spectrum changes.
Changes in heat conduction as large as 10% can be achieved over large
temperature ranges, opening a possibility for practical heat switches based on
phonon spectrum changes.

<h3>Algorithmic Analysis for Reproducible Thickness Determination of  Semiconducting 2D Nanomaterials based on UV/VIS Extinction Spectroscopy</h3>

<i>Nico Kubetschek, Claudia Backes, Stuart Goldie</i>
<p>Rapid and reliable analysis of liquid dispersions of 2D materials is
essential for fully harnessing their potential, allowing size and quality
validation before subsequent processing or device fabrication. Existing UV/VIS
extinction spectroscopy-based metrics, particularly those related to thickness,
have shown promise but rely on manual data processing, which can introduce
irreproducibility and user errors. To address this challenge and enable uniform
analysis across laboratories, we have developed a freely available program for
the reproducible analysis of nanosheet dispersions. Specifically, we apply a
smoothing routine to the spectral data, take the second derivative and use
integral areas to find the wavelength of exciton transitions. Our program
enables rapid measurement of nanosheet concentration, length and thickness by
UV/VIS spectroscopy and we have refined thickness metrics for eight common 2D
nanomaterials. The program and methodology are freely available for use, and
allow metrics for new materials to be implemented easily in the future.

<h3>Toward Mass-Production of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Solar Cells:  Scalable Growth of Photovoltaic-Grade Multilayer WSe2 by Tungsten  Selenization</h3>

<p>Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising for
high-specific-power photovoltaics due to desirable band gaps, high absorption
coefficients, and ideally dangling-bond-free surfaces. Despite their potential,
the majority of TMD solar cells are fabricated in a non-scalable fashion using
exfoliated materials due to the absence of high-quality, large-area, multilayer
TMDs. Here, we present the scalable, thickness-tunable synthesis of multilayer
tungsten diselenide (WSe$_{2}$) films by selenizing pre-patterned tungsten with
either solid source selenium or H$_{2}$Se precursors, which leads to smooth,
wafer-scale WSe$_{2}$ films with a layered van der Waals structure. The films
have charge carrier lifetimes up to 144 ns, over 14x higher than large-area TMD
films previously demonstrated. Such high carrier lifetimes correspond to power
conversion efficiency of ~22% and specific power of ~64 W g$^{-1}$ in a
packaged solar cell, or ~3 W g$^{-1}$ in a fully-packaged solar module. This
paves the way for the mass-production of high-efficiency multilayer WSe$_{2}$
solar cells at low cost.

<h3>Chemical tuning of photo- and persistent luminescence of Cr3+-activated  beta-Ga2O3 by alloying with Al2O3 and In2O3</h3>

<p>An effect of alloying of the monoclinic beta- Ga2O3 with Al2O3 and In2O3 on
the photoluminescent, thermoluminescent and persistent luminescent properties
of Cr3+ ions has been comprehensively investigated. For this purpose, various
series of Cr3+ and Ca2+ co-doped microcrystalline phosphors were synthesized by
the solution combustion method, including pseudobinary compounds like
(Ga-Al)2O3 with up to 20% Al and (Ga-In)2O3 with up to 50% In as well as
pseudoternary compounds (Ga Al In)2O3 with balanced proportion of Al, Ga and
In. The phase composition and crystal structure of the obtained materials were
examined by X-ray powder diffraction technique. Detailed luminescence studies
were conducted for the (Ga-Al)2O3 and (Ga-In)2O3 compounds which exhibited a
single-phase monoclinic structure. Low-temperature and time-resolved
photoluminescence investigations of the Cr-doped pseudobinary compounds
unveiled several types of Cr3+ centres, attributed to the Al-, Ga- and
In-centred octahedra in the studied alloys. The obtained results underscore the
benefit of bandgap engineering through alteration in the host lattice chemical
composition for efficient tuning of the thermoluminescent and persistent
luminescent properties of the near-infrared-emitting beta Ga2O3:Cr based
phosphors. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that modification of the chemical
composition of the host lattice also adjusts the thermometric performance of
the studied phosphors. Indeed, the specific sensitivity of the beta- Ga2O3:Cr3+
decay time luminescence thermometer showed nearly twofold enhancement when the
host lattice was alloyed with 30% of In2O3.

<h3>Incidence of the Brownian relaxation process on the magnetic properties  of ferrofluids</h3>

<br>
<i>Lili Vajtai, Ferenc Simon, Maria del Puerto Morales, Kolos Moln√°r, Bal√°zs G√°bor Pinke, Norbert Marcel Nemes</i>
<p>Ferrofluids containing magnetic nanoparticles represent a special class of
magnetic materials due to the added freedom of particle tumbling in the fluids.
We studied this process, known as Brownian relaxation, and its effect on the
magnetic properties of ferrofluids with controlled magnetite nanoparticle
sizes. For small nanoparticles (below 10 nm diameter) the N\'eel process is
expected to dominate the magnetic response, whereas for larger particles,
Brownian relaxation becomes important. Temperature- and magnetic
field-dependent magnetization studies, differential scanning calorimetry, and
AC susceptibility measurements were carried out for 6, 8, 10.6, and 13.5 nm
diameter magnetite nanoparticles suspended in water. We identify clear
fingerprints of the Brownian relaxation for the sample of the large diameter
nanoparticles as both magnetic and thermal hysteresis develop at the water
freezing temperature, whereas the samples of small diameter nanoparticles
remain hysteresis-free down to the magnetic blocking temperature. This is
supported by the temperature-dependent AC susceptibility measurements: above
273 K, the data show a low-frequency Debye peak, which is characteristic of the
Brownian relaxation. This peak vanishes below 273 K.

<h3>Real-space analysis of Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction</h3>

<br>
<i>Jan Skolimowski</i>
<p>The Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction model has gained a lot of attention in
recent years, due to the fact it is exactly solvable in momentum space in any
dimension while capturing some key features of the Mott phase. Here a
one-dimensional lattice model with this interaction is approached from the
real-space perspective, to explore how breaking the translation invariance of a
lattice affects the intuition built by studying the exact solution in
$k$-space. The ground state properties of chains with periodic and open
boundary conditions are calculated and compared with both the exact solution in
momentum space, as well as with analogous solutions of the Hubbard model. The
results show that introducing hard edges enhances the ferromagnetic
correlations and the system undergoes a magnetic transition before reaching the
strong coupling limit. Understanding the impact of hard edges is a crucial step
toward answering the looming question of the existence of edge states and other
topological phenomena in systems with this type of interaction.

<i>Noah Schnitzer, Berit H. Goodge, Gregory Powers, Jaewook Kim, Sang-Wook Cheong, Ismail El Baggari, Lena F. Kourkoutis</i>
<p>Charge order pervades the phase diagrams of many quantum materials where it
competes with superconducting and magnetic phases, hosts electronic phase
transitions and topological defects, and couples to the lattice generating
intricate structural distortions. Incommensurate charge order is readily
stabilized in manganese oxides where it is associated with anomalous electronic
and magnetic properties, but its nanoscale structural inhomogeneity complicates
precise characterization and understanding of these phases. Leveraging
atomic-resolution variable temperature cryogenic scanning transmission electron
microscopy (cryo-STEM), we characterize the thermal evolution of charge order
in a model manganite system, finding that mobile networks of topological
defects generate phase inhomogeneity and induce incommensuration in an
otherwise lattice-locked modulation. The melting of charge order at high
temperatures is accompanied by generation of additional defects which decouple
large areas of the order from the lattice.

<br>
<i>R. R. Hartmann, M. E. Portnoi</i>
<p>We show that the (2+1)-dimensional massless Dirac equation, which includes a
tilt term, can be reduced to the biconfluent Heun equation for a broad range of
scalar confining potentials, including the well-known Morse potential. Applying
these solutions, we investigate a bipolar electron waveguide in 8-$Pmmn$
borophene, formed by a well and barrier, both described by the Morse potential.
We demonstrate that the ability of two-dimensional materials with tilted Dirac
cones to localize electrons in both a barrier and a well can be harnessed to
create pseudogaps in their electronic spectrum. These pseudogaps can be tuned
through varying the applied top-gate voltage. Potential opto-valleytronic and
terahertz applications are discussed.

<h3>Electron cooling in graphene thermal transistors</h3>

<i>Federico Paolucci, Federica Bianco, Francesco Giazotto, Stefano Roddaro</i>
<p>In the emergent field of quantum technology, the ability to manage heat at
the nanoscale and in cryogenic conditions is crucial for enhancing device
performance in terms of noise, coherence, and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate
the active cooling and refrigeration of the electron gas in a graphene thermal
transistor, by taking advantage of nanoscale superconductive tunnel contacts
able to pump or extract heat directly from the electrons in the device. Our
prototypes achieved a top cooling of electrons in graphene of about 15 mK at a
bath temperature of about 450 mK, demonstrating the viability of the proposed
device architecture. Our experimental findings are backed by a detailed thermal
model that accurately replicated the observed device behavior. Alternative
cooling schemes and perspectives are discussed in light of the reported
results. Finally, our graphene thermal transistor could find application in
superconducting hybrid quantum technologies.

<h3>Anomalous Casimir effect in an expanding ring</h3>

<br>
<i>Baptiste Bermond, Adolfo G. Grushin, David Carpentier</i>
<p>The Casimir effect is macroscopic evidence of the quantum nature of the
vacuum, and it is triggered by boundary conditions in space or time. For a
massless field on a ring, an experimentally accessible model of an expanding
universe, the Casimir effect changes the groundstate energy through a
correction that depends on the ring's radius. In this work, we show that the
ring's energy and pressure acquire additional, sizable corrections, when the
ring's radius is increased fast enough. This effect is distinct from the
dynamical Casimir effect: it is a manifestation of the conformal anomaly,
originating from the spacetime curvature induced by the evolution in time of
the ring's geometry. This anomalous Casimir effect is measurable through the
work necessary to increase the ring size, which becomes non-monotonous in time.

<p>Open-shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent promising
building blocks for carbon-based functional magnetic materials. Their magnetic
properties stem from the presence of unpaired electrons localized in radical
states of $\pi$ character. Consequently, these materials are inclined to
exhibit spin delocalization, form extended collective states, and respond to
the flexibility of the molecular backbones. However, they are also highly
reactive, requiring structural strategies to protect the radical states from
reacting with the environment. Here, we demonstrate that the open-shell ground
state of the diradical 2-OS survives on a Au(111) substrate as a global singlet
formed by two unpaired electrons with anti-parallel spins coupled through a
conformational dependent interaction. The 2-OS molecule is a protected
derivative of the Chichibabin's diradical, featuring a non-planar geometry that
destabilizes the closed-shell quinoidal structure. Using scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM), we localized the two interacting spins at the molecular
edges, and detected an excited triplet state a few millielectronvolts above the
singlet ground state. Mean-field Hubbard simulations reveal that the exchange
coupling between the two spins strongly depends on the torsional angles between
the different molecular moieties, suggesting the possibility of influencing the
molecule's magnetic state through structural changes. This was demonstrated
here using the STM tip to manipulate the molecular conformation, while
simultaneously detecting changes in the spin excitation spectrum. Our work
suggests the potential of these PAHs for a new class of all-carbon
spin-crossover materials.

<p>Living materials adapt their shape to signals from the environment, yet the
impact of shape changes on signal processing and the associated feedback
dynamics remain unclear. We derive coarse-grained equations for droplets that
adjust their interfacial tension in response to signals exchanged at contact
surfaces, from the microscopic biophysics of adhesion and signaling. We find
that droplet pairs exhibit symmetry-breaking, excitability, and oscillations.
The underlying critical points reveal novel mechanisms for physical signal
processing through shape adaptation in soft active materials.

<h3>Coarse-Graining in Space versus Time</h3>

<br>
<i>Jaehyeok Jin, David R. Reichman, Jeppe C. Dyre, Ulf R. Pedersen</i>
<p>Understanding the structure and dynamics of liquids is pivotal for the study
of larger spatiotemporal processes, particularly for glass-forming materials at
low temperatures. The so-called thermodynamic scaling relation, validated for
many molecular systems through experiments, offers an efficient means to
explore a vast range of time scales along a one-dimensional phase diagram.
Isomorph theory provides a theoretical framework for thermodynamic scaling
based on strong virial-potential energy correlations, but this approach is most
successful for simple point particles. In particular, isomorph theory has
resisted extension to complex molecular liquids due to the existence of
high-frequency intramolecular interactions. To elucidate the microscopic origin
of density scaling for molecular systems, we employ two distinct approaches for
coarse-graining in space or in time. The former eliminates fast degrees of
freedom by reducing a molecule to a center-of-mass-level description, while the
latter involves temporally averaged fluctuations or correlation functions over
the characteristic time scale. We show that both approaches yield a consistent
density scaling coefficient for ortho-terphenyl, which is moreover in agreement
with the experimental value. Building upon these findings, we derive the
density scaling relationship exhibiting a single-parameter phase diagram from
fully atomistic simulations. Our results unravel the microscopic nature
underlying thermodynamic scaling and shed light on the role of coarse-graining
for assessing the slow fluctuations in molecular systems, ultimately enabling
the extension of systematic bottom-up approaches to larger and more complex
molecular liquids that are experimentally challenging to probe.

<i>Aravind Devarakonda, Alan Chen, Shiang Fang, David Graf, Markus Kriener, Austin J. Akey, David C. Bell, Takehito Suzuki, Joseph G. Checkelsky</i>
<p>Electronic properties of crystals can be manipulated using spatially periodic
modulations. Long-wavelength, incommensurate modulations are of particular
interest, exemplified recently by moir\'e patterned van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructures. Bulk vdW superlattices hosting interfaces between clean 2D
layers represent scalable bulk analogs of vdW heterostructures and present a
complementary venue to explore incommensurately modulated 2D states. Here we
report the bulk vdW superlattice SrTa$_2$S$_5$ realizing an incommensurate 1D
modulation of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) $H$-TaS$_2$ layers.
High-quality electronic transport in the $H$-TaS$_2$ layers, evidenced by
quantum oscillations, is made anisotropic by the modulation and shows
commensurability oscillations akin to lithographically modulated 2D systems. We
also find unconventional, clean-limit superconductivity (SC) in SrTa$_2$S$_5$
with a pronounced suppression of interlayer coherence relative to intralayer
coherence. Such a hierarchy can arise from pair-density wave (PDW) SC with
mismatched spatial arrangement in adjacent superconducting layers. Examining
the in-plane magnetic field $H_{ab}$ dependence of interlayer critical current
density $J_c$, we find anisotropy with respect to $H_{ab}$ orientation: $J_c$
is maximized (minimized) when $H_{ab}$ is perpendicular (parallel) to the
stripes, consistent with 1D PDW SC. From diffraction we find the structural
modulation is shifted between adjacent $H$-TaS$_2$ layers, suggesting
mismatched 1D PDW is seeded by the striped structure. With a high-mobility
Fermi liquid in a coherently modulated structure, SrTa$_2$S$_5$ is a promising
host for novel phenomena anticipated in clean, striped metals and
superconductors. More broadly, SrTa$_2$S$_5$ establishes bulk vdW superlattices
as macroscopic platforms to address long-standing predictions for modulated
electronic phases.

Leveraging the Bass diffusion model, we derive a Gompertz-like function
explaining the long-term innovation trends. The validity of our model is
confirmed using citation data, Google trends, and a recurrent neural network,
which also reveals short-term fluctuations. Further analysis through an
