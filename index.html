<h3>How general is the Jensen--Varadhan large deviation functional for 1D  conservation laws?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08371" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08371</a>
<br>
<i>Julien Barré, Ouassim Feliachi</i>
<p>Starting from a microscopic particle model whose hydrodynamic limit under
hyperbolic space-time scaling is a 1D conservation law, we derive the large
deviation rate function encoding the probability to observe a density profile
which is a non entropic shock, and compare this large deviation rate function
with the classical Jensen-Varadhan functional, valid for the totally asymmetric
exclusion process and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process in the strong
asymmetry limit. We find that these two functionals have no reason to coincide,
and in this sense Jensen-Varadhan functional is not universal. However, they do
coincide in a small Mach number limit, suggesting that universality is restored
in this regime. We then compute the leading order correction to the
Jensen-Varadhan functional.

<h3>Effect of Dispersion and Different Carrier Transitions on Absorption  Characteristics of GaAs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06773" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06773</a>
<br>
<i>Subarna Alam, Mohammad Jahangir Alam</i>
<p>One of the basic optoelectronic characteristics is the absorption of any
optoelectronic device or material. We present the characteristics of pure GaAs
and the deviation of ideal spectra. Due to crystal defects, vacancies,
impurities, etc., energy states exist in the semiconductor other than the
allowed bands (conduction and valence bands). In this research, the effect of
transitions between these states on absorption spectra and how the absorption
coefficients change with the density and location of those states are analyzed
numerically. Among the cases of 0.07 eV, 0.12 eV, and 0.17 eV with the density
of 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, the minimum deviation occurs for the states
located 0.07 eV below the conduction band and when the energy states have the
minimum density of 2% and the deviation increases for the cases of 0.12 eV and
0.17 eV with higher densities.

<p>Large scale molecular dynamics simulations on polyvinyl alcohol were used to
investigate the distribution of unoccupied space under different heat
treatments. Representative volume elements consisting of 3600 chains of 300
monomers were equilibrated at melt state and cooled by different cooling rates.
The positions of center of mass of the monomers were extracted and a series of
spatial analysis were conducted to estimate the distribution of free volume or
unoccupied space by Voronoi tessellation algorithm. An open-source software was
employed which incorporates both compilers of Matlab and C programing languages
to reduce the computational costs associated with Voronoi calculations and
statistical analysis. The results confirmed that low free volume content is
achievable through annealing while high free volume content is achievable
through quenching samples at high cooling rates. An appreciable degree of
short-range order in the packing of chains is revealed in annealed samples.

<h3>Fermi-Level Pinning and Barrier Height Control at epitaxially grown  ferromagnet/ZnO/metal Schottky Interfaces for opto-spintronics applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06778" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06778</a>

<i>Mohamed Belmoubarik</i>
<p>Schottky contacts (SC) at the ferromagnet/ZnO interface are good candidates
for the realization and control of several semiconductor emerging magnetic
phenomena such spin injection and spin-controlled photonics. In this work, we
demonstrate the epitaxial growth of single-phase and wurtzite-ZnO thin films on
fcc Pt/Co$_{0.30}$Pt$_{0.70}$ (111) electrodes by MBE technique. While the
magnetic properties of the Pt/Co$_{0.30}$Pt$_{0.70}$ buffer remain unchanged
after the ZnO growth, the electric measurements of back-to-back Schottky diodes
revealed a Schottky barrier height at the metal/ZnO interfaces in the range of
590-690 meV using Cu, Pt and Co$_{0.30}$Pt$_{0.70}$ contacts. A pinning factor
S and a charge neutrality level (CNL) ${\Phi}_{CNL}$ of 0.08 and 4.94 eV,
respectively, were obtained indicating a strong Fermi-level pining with a CNL
level that lies 0.64 eV below the conductance band of ZnO semiconductor. These
experimental findings indicate that Co$_{0.30}$Pt$_{0.70}$/ZnO interface
follows the metal-induced gap states model and can open a pathway for the
realization of opto-spintronics applications such spin-LEDs.

<h3>VAE for Modified 1-Hot Generative Materials Modeling, A Step Towards  Inverse Material Design</h3>

<br>
<i>Khalid El-Awady</i>
<p>We investigate the construction of generative models capable of encoding
physical constraints that can be hard to express explicitly. For the problem of
inverse material design, where one seeks to design a material with a prescribed
set of properties, a significant challenge is ensuring synthetic viability of a
proposed new material. We encode an implicit dataset relationships, namely that
certain materials can be decomposed into other ones in the dataset, and present
a VAE model capable of preserving this property in the latent space and
generating new samples with the same. This is particularly useful in sequential
inverse material design, an emergent research area that seeks to design a
material with specific properties by sequentially adding (or removing) elements
using policies trained through deep reinforcement learning.

<h3>Quantum many-body scars from unstable periodic orbits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06848" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06848</a>
<br>
<i>Bertrand Evrard, Andrea Pizzi, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Ceren B. Dag</i>
<p>Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) play a key role in the theory of chaos,
constituting the "skeleton" of classical chaotic systems and "scarring" the
eigenstates of the corresponding quantum system. Recently, nonthermal many-body
eigenstates embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum have been identified as a
many-body generalization of quantum scars. The latter, however, are not clearly
associated to a chaotic phase space, and the connection between the single- and
many-body notions of quantum scars remains therefore incomplete. Here, we find
the first quantum many-body scars originating from UPOs of a chaotic phase
space. Remarkably, these states verify the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis, and we thus refer to them as thermal quantum many-body scars. While
they do not preclude thermalization, their spectral structure featuring
approximately equispaced towers of states yields an anomalous oscillatory
dynamics preceding thermalization for wavepackets initialized on an UPO.
Remarkably, our model hosts both types of scars, thermal and nonthermal, and
allows to study the crossover between the two. Our work illustrates the
fundamental principle of classical-quantum correspondence in a many-body
system, and its limitations.

<h3>Universal Modelling of Emergent Oscillations in Fractional Quantum Hall  Fluids</h3>

<p>Density oscillations in quantum fluids can reveal their fundamental
characteristic features. In this work, we study the density oscillation of
incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids created by flux insertion.
For the model Laughlin state, we find that the complex oscillations seen in
various density profiles in real space can be universally captured by a simple
damped oscillator model in the occupation-number space. It requires only two
independent fitting parameters or characteristic length scales: the decay
length and the oscillation wave number. Realistic Coulomb quasiholes can be
viewed as Laughlin quasiholes dressed by magnetorotons which can be modeled by
a generalized damped oscillator model. Our work reveals the fundamental
connections between the oscillations seen in various aspects of FQH fluids such
as in the density of quasiholes, edge, and the pair correlation function. The
presented model is useful for the study of quasihole sizes for their control
and braiding in experiments and large-scale numerical computation of
variational energies.

<h3>Self-consistent quantum-kinetic theory for interacting drifting  electrons and force-driven phonons in a 1D system</h3>

<p>A self-consistent quantum-kinetic model is developed for studying
strong-field nonlinear electron transport interacting with force-driven phonons
within a quantum-wire system. For this model, phonons can be dragged into
motion through strong electron-phonon scattering by fast-moving electrons along
the opposite direction of the DC electric field. Meanwhile, the DC-field
induced charge current of electrons can be either enhanced or reduced by the
same electron-phonon scattering, depending on the relative direction of a DC
field with respect to that of an applied temperature gradient for driving
phonons. By making use of this quantum-kinetic model beyond the relaxation-time
approximation, neither electron nor phonon temperature is required for
describing ultrafast electron-phonon scattering and their correlated transports
in this 1D electronic-lattice system. onsistent quantum-kinetic model is

<h3>NiGa$_{2}$O$_{4}$ interfacial layers in NiO/Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$  heterojunction diodes at high temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06924</a>
<br>
<i>Kingsley Egbo, Emily M. Garrity, William A. Callahan, Chris Chae, Cheng-Wei Lee, Brooks Tellekamp, Jinwoo Hwang, Vladan Stevanovic, Andriy Zakutayev</i>
<p>NiO/Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ heterojunction diodes have attracted attention for
high-power applications, but their high-temperature performance and reliability
remain underexplored. Here we report on the time evolution of the static
electrical properties in the widely studied
p-NiO/n-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$heterojunction diodes and the formation of
NiGa$_{2}$O$_{4}$ interfacial layers when operated at $550^{\circ}$C. Results
of our thermal cycling experiment show an initial leakage current increase
which stabilizes after sustained thermal load, due to reactions at the
NiO-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ interface. High-resolution TEM microstructure analysis of
the devices after thermal cycling indicates that the NiO-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$
interface forms ternary compounds at high temperatures, and thermodynamic
calculations suggest the formation of the spinel NiGa$_{2}$O$_{4}$ layer
between NiO and Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$. First-principles defect calculations find that
NiGa$_{2}$O$_{4}$ shows low p-type intrinsic doping, and hence can also serve
to limit electric field crowding at the interface. Vertical NiO/Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$
diodes with intentionally grown 5 nm thin spinel-type NiGa$_{2}$O$_{4}$
interfacial layers show excellent device ON/OFF ratio of > 10$^{10}$($\pm$3 V),
V$_{ON}$ of ~1.9 V, and breakdown voltage of ~ 1.2 kV for an initial
unoptimized 300-micron diameter device. These p-n heterojunction diodes are
promising for high-voltage, high-temperature applications.

<h3>Broad Yet Narrow: Super-resolution techniques to simulate electronic  spectra of large molecular systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06929</a>
<br>
<i>Matthias Kick, Ezra Alexander, Anton Beiersdorfer, Troy Van Voorhis</i>
<p>An accurate treatment of electronic spectra in large systems with a technique
such as time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is computationally
challenging. Due to the Nyquist sampling theorem, direct real time simulations
must be prohibitively long in order to recover a suitably sharp resolution in
frequency space. Super-resolution techniques such as compressed sensing and
MUSIC assume only a small number of excitations contribute to the spectrum,
which fails in large molecular systems where the number of excitations is
typically very large. We present a new approach that combines exact short time
dynamics with approximate frequency space methods to capture large narrow
features embedded in a dense manifold of smaller nearby peaks. We show that our
approach can accurately capture narrow features and broad quasi-continuum of
states at the same time - even when the features overlap in frequency. Our
approach is able reduce the required simulation time by a factor of 20-40 with
respect to standard Fourier analysis and shows promise for the accurate
whole-spectrum prediction of large molecules and materials.

<h3>In-plane Density Gradation of Shoe Midsoles for Optimized Cushioning  Performance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06940" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06940</a>
<br>
<i>Kazi Zahir Uddin, Hai Anh Nguyen, Thanh T. Nguyen, Mitja Trkov, George Youssef, Behrad Koohbor</i>
<p>Midsoles are important components in footwear as they provide shock
absorption and stability, thereby improving comfort and effectively preventing
certain foot and ankle injuries. A rationally tailored midsole can potentially
mitigate plantar pressure, improving performance and comfort levels. Despite
the importance of midsole design, the potential of using in-plane density
gradation in midsole has been rarely explored in earlier studies. The present
work investigates the effectiveness of in-plane density gradation in shoe
midsoles using a new class of polyurea foams as the material candidate. Their
excellent cushioning properties justify the use of polyurea foams. Different
polyurea foam densities, ranging from 95 to 350 kg/m3 are examined and tested
to construct density-dependent correlative mathematical relations required for
the optimization process. An optimization framework is then created to allocate
foam densities at certain plantar zones based on the required cushioning
performance constrained by the local pressures. The interior-point algorithm
was used to solve the constrained optimization problem. The optimization
algorithm introduces a novel approach, utilizing the maximum specific energy
absorption as the objective function. The optimization process identifies
specific foam densities at various plantar regions for maximum biomechanical
energy dissipation without incurring additional weight penalties. Our results
suggest midsole design can benefit from horizontal (in-plane) density
gradation, leading to potential weight reduction and localized cushioning
improvements. With local plantar peak pressure data analysis, the optimization
results indicate low-density polyurea foams (140 kg/m3) for central and lateral
phalanges, whereas stiffer foams (185-230 kg/m3) are identified as suitable
candidates for metatarsal and arch regions in an in-plane density graded
midsole design.

<h3>Parton Route to Adiabatic Continuity between Integer and Fractional  Quantum Hall Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06965" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06965</a>
<br>
<i>Koji Kudo, Jonathan Schirmer, Jainendra K. Jain</i>
<p>The parton theory constructs candidate FQH states by decomposing the physical
particles into unphysical partons, placing the partons in IQH states, and then
gluing the partons back into the physical particles. Field theoretical
formulations execute the gluing process through the device of emergent gauge
fields. Here we study the process of going from the IQH effect of fermionic
partons to the FQH effect of bosons by introducing an attractive interaction
between the fermions and continuously increasing its strength. It is far from
obvious, a priori, that this process could be adiabatic, that is, go through
without a gap closing, given that the wave function of the bosonic bound state
and its Landau levels (LLs) involve all LLs of the fermions. The absence of an
energy cutoff also makes the theoretical study challenging. We proceed by
considering fermions on a lattice (a convenient lattice for our purposes is a
subdivided icosahedron enclosing a magnetic monopole, which simulates the
standard spherical geometry used in theoretical studies of the FQH effect),
wherein it is possible to work with the full Hilbert space during the entire
process. For all finite systems that we have studied, we find that the system
of two species of fermions occupying IQH states evolves adiabatically into the
FQH effect of the bosons, suggesting that the process may be adiabatic also in
the thermodynamic limit. This physics, reminiscent of the well studied BCS to
BEC crossover, can in principle be realized in ultra-cold atomic systems
consisting of two species of fermionic atoms in a synthetic magnetic field. Our
study suggests that as the strength of the attractive interaction between the
fermions of different species is increased, the system will exhibit a
crossover, without gap closing, from two independent IQH states of fermionic
atoms to a FQH state of bosonic molecules.

<h3>Electrodynamics of the quantum anomalous Hall state in a magnetically  doped topological insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhenisbek Tagay, Hee Taek Yi, Deepti Jain, Seongshik Oh, N. P. Armitage</i>
<p>Magnetically doped topological insulators have been extensively studied over
the past decade as a material platform to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall
effect. Most material realizations are magnetically doped and despite material
advances suffer from large disorder effects. In such systems, it is believed
that magnetic disorder leads to a spatially varying Dirac mass gap and chemical
potential fluctuations, and hence quantized conductance is only observed at
very low temperatures. Here, we use a recently developed high-precision
time-domain terahertz (THz) polarimeter to study the low-energy electrodynamic
response of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films. These films have been
recently shown to exhibit a dc quantized anomalous Hall response up to T = 2 K
at zero gate voltage. We show that the real part of the THz range Hall
conductance $\sigma_{xy}(\omega)$ is slightly smaller than $e^2/h$ down to T =
2 K with an unconventional decreasing dependence on frequency. The imaginary
(dissipative) part of $\sigma_{xy}(\omega)$ is small, but increasing as a
function of omega. We connect both aspects of our data to a simple model for
effective magnetic gap disorder. Our work highlights the different effect that
disorder can have on the dc vs. ac quantum anomalous Hall effect.

<h3>Stable higher-order vortex quantum droplets in an annular potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07011" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07011</a>
<br>
<i>Liangwei Dong, Mingjing Fan, Boris A. Malomed</i>
<p>We address the existence, stability, and evolution of two-dimensional vortex
quantum droplets (VQDs) in binary Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a
ring-shaped potential. The interplay of the Lee-Huang-Yang-amended nonlinearity
and trapping potential supports two VQD branches, controlled by the radius,
width and depth of the potential profile. While the lower-branch VQDs,
bifurcating from the system's linear modes, are completely unstable, the upper
branch is fully stable for all values of the topological charge $m$ and
potential's parameters. Up to $m=12$ (at least), stable VQDs obey the {\it
anti-Vakhitov-Kolokolov} criterion. In the limit of an extremely tight radial
trap, the modulational instability of the quasi-1D azimuthal VQDs is studied
analytically. We thus put forward an effective way to produce stable VQDs with
higher vorticity but a relatively small number of atoms, which is favorable for
experimental realization.

<h3>Magnetic effects of non-magnetic impurities in gapped short-range  resonating valence bond spin liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07026</a>
<br>
<i>Md Zahid Ansari, Kedar Damle</i>
<p>We study the effect of a small density $n_v$ of quenched non-magnetic
impurities, {\em i.e.} vacancy disorder, in gapped short-range resonating
valence bond (RVB) spin liquid states and valence bond solid (VBS) states of
quantum magnets. We argue that a large class of short-range RVB liquids are
stable at small $n_v$ on the kagome lattice, while the corresponding states on
triangular, square, and honeycomb lattices are unstable at any nonzero $n_v$
due to the presence of emergent vacancy-induced local moments. In contrast, VBS
states are argued to be generically unstable (independent of lattice geometry)
at nonzero $n_v$ due to such a local-moment instability. Our arguments rely in
part on an analysis of the statistical mechanics of maximally-packed dimer
covers of the diluted lattice, and are fully supported by our computational
results on $O(N)$ symmetric designer Hamiltonians.

<h3>Tuning dissipation dilution in 2D material resonators by MEMS-induced  tension</h3>

<i>M.P.F. Wopereis, N. Bouman, S. Dutta, P.G. Steeneken, F. Alijani, G.J. Verbiest</i>
<p>Resonators based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have exceptional
properties for application as nanomechanical sensors, which could allow them to
operate at high frequencies with high sensitivity. However, the performance of
2D material resonators as nanomechanical sensors is currently limited by their
high dissipation rate, resulting in low quality ($Q$)-factors. Here, we make
use of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to strain 2D material resonators
in situ, enhancing both their resonance frequencies and Q-factors. We
dry-transfer 2D materials on the MEMS actuators and use electron beam-induced
deposition of platinum to clamp them, thus effectively ruling out slippage at
the boundaries. By in-plane straining the membranes in a purely mechanical
fashion, we then increase the tensile energy, thereby diluting dissipation.
Using our method, we can increase the $Q$-factor of 2D material resonators by
91\%, paving the way towards raising the $Q$-factor in resonators based on 2D
materials.

<h3>Biofilms as poroelastic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07060" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07060</a>
<br>
<i>Ana Carpio, Elena Cebrian, Perfecto Vidal</i>
<p>Biofilms are bacterial aggregates encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix
which attach to moist surfaces and are extremely resistant to chemicals and
antibiotics. Recent experiments show that their structure is defined by the
interplay of elastic deformations and liquid transport within the biofilm, in
response to the cellular activity and the interaction with the surrounding
environment. We propose a poroelastic model for elastic deformation and liquid
transport in three dimensional biofilms spreading on agar surfaces. The motion
of the boundaries can be described by the combined use of Von Karman type
approximations for the agar/biofilm interface and thin film approximations for
the biofilm/air interface. Bacterial activity informs the macroscopic
continuous model through source terms and residual stresses, either
phenomenological or derived from microscopic models. We present a procedure to
estimate the structure of such residual stresses, based on a simple cellular
automata description of bacterial activity. Inspired by image processing, we
show that a filtering strategy effectively smooths out the rough tensors
provided by the stochastic cellular automata rules, allowing us to insert them
in the macroscopic model without numerical instability.

<h3>Incorporating Cellular Stochasticity in Solid--Fluid Mixture Biofilm  Models</h3>

<i>Ana Carpio, Elena Cebrian</i>
<p>The dynamics of cellular aggregates is driven by the interplay of
mechanochemical processes and cellular activity. Although deterministic models
may capture mechanical features, local chemical fluctuations trigger random
cell responses, which determine the overall evolution. Incorporating stochastic
cellular behavior in macroscopic models of biological media is a challenging
task. Herein, we propose hybrid models for bacterial biofilm growth, which
couple a two phase solid/fluid mixture description of mechanical and chemical
fields with a dynamic energy budget-based cellular automata treatment of
bacterial activity. Thin film and plate approximations for the relevant
interfaces allow us to obtain numerical solutions exhibiting behaviors observed
in experiments, such as accelerated spread due to water intake from the
environment, wrinkle formation, undulated contour development, and the
appearance of inhomogeneous distributions of differentiated bacteria performing
varied tasks.

<br>
<i>Natalya A. Zimbovskaya</i>
<p>In the present work we theoretically analyze thermoelectric transport in
single-molecule junctions (SMJ) characterized by strong interactions between
electrons on the molecular linkers and phonons in their nuclear environments
where electron hopping between the electrodes and the molecular bridge states
predominates in the steady state electron transport. The analysis is based on
the modified Marcus theory accounting for the lifetime broadening of the
bridge's energy levels. We show that the reorganization processes in the
environment accompanying electron transport may significantly affect SMJ
thermoelectric properties both within and beyond linear transport regime.
Specifically, we study the effect of environmental phonons on the electron
conductance, the thermopower and charge current induced by the temperature
gradient applied across the system.

<h3>Topological characterization of rearrangements in amorphous solids</h3>

<i>Paul Desmarchelier, Spencer Fajardo, Michael L. Falk</i>
<p>In amorphous materials, plasticity is localized and occurs as shear
transformations. It was recently shown by Wu et al. that these shear
transformations can be predicted by applying topological defect concepts
developed for liquid crystals to an analysis of vibrational eigenmodes [Wu et
al.; Nat. Com.,2023]. This study relates the -1 topological defects to the
displacement fields expected of an Eshelby inclusion, which are characterized
by an orientation and the magnitude of the eigenstrain. A corresponding
orientation and magnitude can be defined for each defect using the local
displacement field around each defect. These parameters characterize the
plastic stress relaxation associated with the local structural rearrangement
and can be extracted using the fit to either the global displacement field or
the local field. Both methods provide a reasonable estimation of the
MD-measured stress drop, confirming the localized nature of the displacements

<h3>Hebbian Learning from First Principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07110" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07110</a>
<br>
<i>Linda Albanese, Adriano Barra, Pierluigi Bianco, Fabrizio Durante, Diego Pallara</i>
<p>Recently, the original storage prescription for the Hopfield model of neural
networks -- as well as for its dense generalizations -- has been turned into a
genuine Hebbian learning rule by postulating the expression of its Hamiltonian
for both the supervised and unsupervised protocols. In these notes, first, we
obtain these explicit expressions by relying upon maximum entropy extremization
\`a la Jaynes. Beyond providing a formal derivation of these recipes for
Hebbian learning, this construction also highlights how Lagrangian constraints
within entropy extremization force network's outcomes on neural correlations:
these try to mimic the empirical counterparts hidden in the datasets provided
to the network for its training and, the denser the network, the longer the
correlations that it is able to capture. Next, we prove that, in the big data
limit, whatever the presence of a teacher (or its lacking), not only these
Hebbian learning rules converge to the original storage prescription of the
Hopfield model but also their related free energies (and, thus, the statistical
mechanical picture provided by Amit, Gutfreund and Sompolinsky is fully
recovered). As a sideline, we show mathematical equivalence among standard Cost
functions (Hamiltonian), preferred in Statistical Mechanical jargon, and
quadratic Loss Functions, preferred in Machine Learning terminology. Remarks on
the exponential Hopfield model (as the limit of dense networks with diverging
density) and semi-supervised protocols are also provided.

<h3>Synthesis of thin film infinite-layer nickelates by atomic hydrogen  reduction: clarifying the role of the capping layer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07129" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07129</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher T. Parzyck, Vivek Anil, Yi Wu, Berit H. Goodge, Matthew Roddy, Lena F. Kourkoutis, Darrell G. Schlom, Kyle M. Shen</i>
<p>We present an integrated procedure for the synthesis of infinite-layer
nickelates using molecular-beam epitaxy with gas-phase reduction by atomic
hydrogen. We first discuss challenges in the growth and characterization of
perovskite NdNiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, arising from post growth crack formation in
stoichiometric films. We then detail a procedure for fully reducing NdNiO$_3$
films to the infinite-layer phase, NdNiO$_2$, using atomic hydrogen; the
resulting films display excellent structural quality, smooth surfaces, and
lower residual resistivities than films reduced by other methods. We utilize
the in situ nature of this technique to investigate of the role that SrTiO$_3$
capping layers play in the reduction process, illustrating their importance in
preventing the formation of secondary phases at the exposed nickelate surface.
A comparative bulk- and surface-sensitive study indicates formation of a
polycrystalline crust on the film surface serves to limit the reduction
process.

<h3>Biofilm growth on rugose surfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>David Rodriguez, Baldvin Einarsson, Ana Carpio</i>
<p>A stochastic model is used to assess the effect of external parameters on the
development of submerged biofilms on smooth and rough surfaces. The model
includes basic cellular mechanisms, such as division and spreading, together
with an elementary description of the interaction with the surrounding flow and
probabilistic rules for EPS matrix generation, cell decay and adhesion. Insight
on the interplay of competing mechanisms as the flow or the nutrient
concentration change is gained. Erosion and growth processes combined produce
biofilm structures moving downstream. A rich variety of patterns are generated:
shrinking biofilms, patches, ripple-like structures traveling downstream,
fingers, mounds, streamer-like patterns, flat layers, porous and dendritic
structures. The observed regimes depend on the carbon source and the type of
bacteria.

<i>Valerii Kachin, Juan Camilo López Carreño, Magdalena Stobińska</i>
<p>Topological materials yield robust edge states with potential applications in
electronics or quantum technologies. Yet, their simplest Su--Schrieffer--Heeger
model covers only coupling disorders, leaving other types unexplored. Here, by
studying a quasi-one-dimensional zigzag model with negative couplings, we show
non-chiral edge states simultaneously resilient to dissipation, hopping and
on-site energy disorders. To this end, we derive regularized values of the
topological invariant via a novel approach. Our work hints on constructing
topological phases even in the absence of usual symmetries.

<h3>Dynamics of bacterial aggregates in microflows</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07138</a>
<br>
<i>Ana Carpio, Baldvin Einarsson, David R. Espeso</i>
<p>Biofilms are bacterial aggregates that grow on moist surfaces. Thin
homogeneous biofilms naturally formed on the walls of conducts may serve as
biosensors, providing information on the status of microsystems (MEMS) without
disrupting them. However, uncontrolled biofilm growth may largely disturb the
environment they develop in, increasing the drag and clogging the tubes. To
ensure controlled biofilm expansion we need to understand the effect of
external variables on their structure. We formulate a hybrid model for the
computational study of biofilms growing in laminar microflows. Biomass evolves
according to stochastic rules for adhesion, erosion and motion, informed by
numerical approximations of the flow fields at each stage. The model is tested
studying the formation of streamers in three dimensional corner flows, gaining
some insight on the effect of external variables on their structure.

<h3>Writing and detecting topological charges in exfoliated  Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$</h3>

<p>Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$ is a promising two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW)
magnet for practical applications, given its magnetic properties. These include
Curie temperatures above room temperature, and topological spin textures (TST
or both merons and skyrmions), responsible for a pronounced anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) and its topological counterpart (THE), which can be harvested for
spintronics. Here, we show that both the AHE and THE can be amplified
considerably by just adjusting the thickness of exfoliated Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$,
with THE becoming observable even in zero magnetic field due to a field-induced
unbalance in topological charges. Using a complementary suite of techniques,
including electronic transport, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, and
micromagnetic simulations, we reveal the emergence of substantial coercive
fields upon exfoliation, which are absent in the bulk, implying
thickness-dependent magnetic interactions that affect the TST. We detected a
``magic" thickness $t \sim $30 nm where the formation of TST is maximized,
inducing large magnitudes for the topological charge density ($6.45 \times
10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$), and the concomitant anomalous ($\rho_{xy}^{\text{A,max}}
\simeq 22.6$ $\mu \Omega $cm) and topological ($\rho_{xy}^{\text{u,T}} \simeq
15$ $\mu \Omega$ cm) Hall resistivities at $T$ ~ 120 K. These values for
$\rho_{xy}^{\text{A,max}}$ and $\rho_{xy}^{\text{u,T}}$ are higher than those
found in magnetic topological insulators and, so far, the largest reported for
2D magnets. The hitherto unobserved THE under zero magnetic field could provide
a platform for the writing and electrical detection of TST aiming at
energy-efficient devices based on vdW ferromagnets.

<h3>Reliable operation of Cr$_2$O$_3$:Mg/ $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n  heterojunction diodes at 600$^\circ$C</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07166</a>
<br>
<i>William A. Callahan, Kingsley Egbo, Cheng-Wei Lee, David Ginley, Ryan O'Hayre, Andriy Zakutayev</i>
<p>$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based semiconductor heterojunctions have recently
demonstrated improved performance at high voltages and elevated temperatures
and are thus promising for applications in power electronic devices and
harsh-environment sensors. However, the long-term reliability of these
ultra-wide band gap (UWBG) semiconductor devices remains barely addressed and
may be strongly influenced by chemical reactions at the p-n heterojunction
interface. Here, we experimentally demonstrate operation and evaluate the
reliability of Cr$_2$O$_3$:Mg/ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n heterojunction diodes at
during extended operation at 600$^\circ$C, as well as after 30 repeated cycles
between 25-550$^\circ$C. The calculated pO2-temperature phase stability diagram
of the Ga-Cr-O material system predicts that Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Cr$_2$O$_3$ should
remain thermodynamically stable in contact with each other over a wide range of
oxygen pressures and operating temperatures. The fabricated Cr$_2$O$_3$:Mg /
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n heterojunction diodes show room-temperature on/off
ratios >10$^4$ at $\pm$5V and a breakdown voltage (V$_{Br}$) of -390V. The
leakage current increases with increasing temperature up to 600$^\circ$C, which
is attributed to Poole-Frenkel emission with a trap barrier height of 0.19 eV.
Over the course of a 140-hour thermal soak at 600$^\circ$C, both the device
turn-on voltage and on-state resistance increase from 1.08V and 5.34
m$\Omega$-cm$^2$ to 1.59V and 7.1 m$\Omega$-cm$^2$ respectively. This increase
is attributed to the accumulation of Mg and MgO at the Cr$_2$O$_3$/Ga$_2$O$_3$
interface as observed from TOF-SIMS analysis. These findings inform future
design strategies of UWBG semiconductor devices for harsh environment operation
and underscore the need for further reliability assessments for
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ based devices.

<br>
<i>Yong Pang, Tao Liu</i>
<p>The rise of soft materials and additive manufacturing has provided the
feasibility of developing elastomer lattices for various engineering
applications. Although earlier attempts have been made to manufacture and test
the elastomer lattices, a comprehensive understanding of their fracture
behaviour has remained elusive. Inspired by the soft foams in mussel plaque
core, the present study introduces the concept of soft, ductile, and tough
elastomer lattices. Uniaxial and planar tension tests were conducted, and
numerical models were developed to facilitate data interpretation. The
applicability of planar tension for measuring the fracture energy of elastomer
lattices was confirmed through tensile tests using samples with various crack
lengths and double-peeling tests. In addition, the fracture energy of the
elastomer lattices was sensitive to volume fraction but insensitive to initial
crack length, thickness, and height. Notably, two distinct failure modes, truss
failure and joint failure, were correlated with volume fraction. The specimens
that failed at the transition between these two failure modes achieve a higher
fracture energy. This study provides new insights to the materials science
community and provides a foundation for the development of lightweight,
damage-tolerant, and high-performance metamaterials.

<h3>Laser-field detuning assisted optimization of exciton valley dynamics in  monolayer WSe$_2$: Geometric quantum speed limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07191" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07191</a>
<br>
<i>Kang Lan, Shijie Xie, Jiyong Fu</i>
<p>Optimizing valley dynamics is an effective instrument towards precisely
manipulating qubit in the context of two-dimensional semiconductor. In this
work, we construct a comprehensive model, involving both intra- and intervalley
channels of excitons in monolayer WSe$_2$, and simultaneously takes the
light-matter interaction into account, to investigate the optimal control of
valley dynamics with an initial coherent excitonic state. Based on the quantum
speed limit (QSL) theory, we propose two optimal control schemes aiming to
reduce the evolution time of valley dynamics reaching the target state, along
with to boost the evolution speed over a period of time. Further, we emphasize
that the implementation of dynamical optimization is closely related to the
detuning difference -- the difference of exciton-laser field detunings between
the K and K' valleys -- which is determined by the optical excitation mode and
magnetically-induced valley splitting. In particular, we reveal that a small
detuning difference drives the actual dynamical path to converge towards the
geodesic length between the initial and final states, allowing the system to
evolve with the least time. Especially, in the presence of valley coherence,
the actual evolution time and the calculated QSL time almost coincide,
facilitating high fidelity in information transmission based on the valley
qubit. Remarkably, we demonstrate an intriguing enhancement in evolution speed
of valley dynamics, by adopting a large detuning difference, which induces an
emerging valley polarization even without initial polarization. Our work opens
a new paradigm for optically tuning excitonic physics in valleytronic
applications, and may also offer solutions to some urgent problems such as
speed limit of information transmission in qubit.

<h3>Polariton lattices as binarized neuromorphic networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Evgeny Sedov, Alexey Kavokin</i>
<p>We introduce a novel neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of
exciton-polariton condensates, intricately interconnected and energized through
non-resonant optical pumping. The network employs a binary framework, where
each neuron, facilitated by the spatial coherence of pairwise coupled
condensates, performs binary operations. This coherence, emerging from the
ballistic propagation of polaritons, ensures efficient, network-wide
communication. The binary neuron switching mechanism, driven by the nonlinear
repulsion through the excitonic component of polaritons, offers computational
efficiency and scalability advantages over continuous weight neural networks.
Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared
to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems. The system's performance was
evaluated using the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition, showcasing
the potential to outperform existing polaritonic neuromorphic systems, as
demonstrated by its impressive predicted classification accuracy of up to
97.5%.

<h3>Incremental SWAP Operator for Entanglement Entropy: Application for  Exponential Observables in Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07244" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07244</a>
<br>
<i>Xuan Zhou, Zi Yang Meng, Yang Qi, Yuan Da Liao</i>
<p>We propose a new method to efficiently compute the entanglement entropy (EE)
of quantum many-body systems. Our approach, called the incremental SWAP
operator method , combines the simplicity of the SWAP operator used in
projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations with recent advances in precisely
computing exponential observables using incremental algorithms. We apply this
technique to obtain accurate EE data at reduced computational cost for 1d and
2d antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models with different bipartition schemes.
Using the computed EE data, we extract the area law coefficient, universal
logarithmic corrections from Goldstone modes, and the geometric constant,
finding quantitative agreement with analytical predictions. Moreover, for the
first time in an unbiased numerical simulation of 2d antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model, we successfully obtain reliable universal logarithmic
corrections from sharp corners that match expected theoretical values. The
consistency between our numerical results and theoretical calculations
demonstrates the power of our approach for accessing challenging universal
entanglement properties. The extensions of our method to other quantum
spin/boson models and the interacting fermion models, are outlined.

<i>I. V. Lukin, A. G. Sotnikov</i>
<p>We develop a new methodology to contract tensor networks within the corner
transfer matrix renormalization group approach for a wide range of
two-dimensional lattice geometries.
We discuss contraction algorithms on the example of triangular, kagome,
honeycomb, square-octagon, star, ruby, square-hexagon-dodecahedron, and dice
lattices.
As benchmark tests, we apply the developed method to the classical Ising
model on different lattices and observe a remarkable agreement of the results
with the available from the literature.
The approach also shows the necessary potential to be applied to various
quantum lattice models in a combination with the wave-function variational
optimization schemes.

<h3>Tailoring Photocatalytic Water Splitting Activity of Boron Thiophene  Polymer through Pore Size Engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07297" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07297</a>
<br>
<i>Preeti Bhauriyal, Thomas Heine</i>
<p>Taking into account the electron-rich and visible light response of
thiophene, first-principles calculations have been carried out to explore the
photocatalytic activity of donor-acceptor polymers incorporating thiophene and
boron. The designed honeycomb-kagome boron thiophene (BTP) polymers with
varying numbers of thiophene units and fixed B center atoms are direct band gap
semiconductors with tunable band gaps ranging from 2.41 eV to 1.88 eV, and show
high absorption coefficients under the ultraviolet and visible regions of the
solar spectrum. Fine-tuning the band edges of the BTP polymer is efficiently
achieved by adjusting the pore size through the manipulation of thiophene units
between the B centers. This manipulation, achieved without excessive chemical
functionalization, facilitates the generation of an appropriate quantity of
photoexcited electrons and/or holes to straddle the redox potential of the
water. Our study demonstrates that two units between B centers of thiophene in
BTP polymers enable overall photocatalytic water splitting, whereas BTP
polymers with larger pores solely promote photocatalytic hydrogen reduction.
Moreover, the thermodynamics of hydrogen and oxygen reduction reactions proceed
either spontaneously or need small additional external biases. Our findings
provide the rationale for designing metal-free and single-material polymer
photocatalysts based on thiophene, specifically for achieving efficient overall
water splitting.

<p>We measured the temperature dependences of the capacity and dielectric losses
of the tape-casted dense ferroelectric composites consisting of 28 vol.% BaTiO3
nanoparticles (average size 24 nm) in the polyvinyl butyral polymer and 35
vol.% BaTiO3 microparticles (0.5-0.7 {\mu}m) dispersed in the ethyl-cellulose,
as well as the ceramics made from the nanoparticles using the annealing at
1250oC. The composite films were covered with Ag electrodes and the
measurements were performed in a wide frequency range. Using the Lichtenecker
effective media approximation, we analysed the effective dielectric response of
the dense ferroelectric composites. To establish the phase state of the
nanoparticles, we analysed the static 137Ba NMR spectra of BaTiO3 nanoparticles
in a wide temperature range from 200 to 400 K. Obtained results revealed that
the ferroelectric properties of the nanoparticles contribute to the effective
dielectric response of the composites in a significantly different way than
predicted by the effective media model. This counterintuitive conclusion
indicates on the strong crosstalk effects in the dense ferroelectric
nanocomposites, which can be very promising for their applications in
nanoelectronics and energy storage.

<h3>Randomly Pruning the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07325</a>
<br>
<i>Richard Berkovits</i>
<p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK) is renowned for its short-time chaotic
behavior, which plays a fundamental role in its application to various fields
such as quantum gravity and holography. The Thouless energy, representing the
energy scale at which the universal chaotic behavior in the energy spectrum
ceases, can be determined from the spectrum itself. When simulating the SYK
model on classical or quantum computers, it is advantageous to minimize the
number of terms in the Hamiltonian by randomly pruning the couplings. In this
paper, we demonstrate that even with a significant pruning, eliminating a large
number of couplings, the chaotic behavior persists up to short time scales This
is true even when only a fraction of the original $O(L^4)$ couplings in the
fully connected SYK model, specifically $O(KL)$, is retained. Here, $L$
represents the number of sites, and $K\sim 10$. The properties of the
long-range energy scales, corresponding to short time scales, are verified
through numerical singular value decomposition (SVD) and level number variance
calculations.

<i>Richard Pedurand, Ilya Golokolenov, Mika Sillanpää, Laure Mercier de Lépinay, Eddy Collin, Andrew Fefferman</i>
<p>The low temperature properties of amorphous solids are usually explained in
terms of atomic-scale tunneling two level systems (TLS). For almost 20 years,
individual TLS have been probed in insulating layers of superconducting quantum
circuits. Detecting individual TLS in mechanical systems has been proposed but
not definitively demonstrated. We describe an optomechanical system that is
appropriate for this goal and describe our progress toward achieving it. In
particular, we show that the expected coupling between the mechanical mode and
a resonant TLS is strong enough for high visibility of a TLS given the
linewidth of the mechanical mode. Furthermore, the electronic noise level of
our measurement system is low enough and the anomalous force noise observed in
other nanomechanical devices is absent.

<h3>Electronic structure and magnetic correlations in trilayer nickelate  superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</h3>

<br>
<i>I. V. Leonov</i>
<p>It has been recently shown that under pressure trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper
nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (LNO) becomes superconducting below a critical
temperature $\sim$20 K, in addition to the infinite-layer and bilayer systems.
Motivated by this observation, we explore the effects of electron correlations
on its electronic structure and magnetic properties using the advanced
DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach. Our results for the normal-state
electronic structure and correlation effects in LNO have much in common with
the infinite-layer and bilayer nickelates, with a remarkable site- and
orbital-dependent renormalizations of the Ni $3d$ bands and notable incoherence
of the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states, caused by correlation effects. Our analysis of
the Fermi surface and magnetic correlations suggests the emergence of competing
spin and charge stripe states, implying the importance of in-plane spin
fluctuations to explain superconductivity in this material.

<br>
<i>Alexander V. Savin, Yuri S. Kivshar</i>
<p>We study numerically nonlinear dynamics of several types of molecular systems
composed of hydrogen-bonded chains placed inside carbon nanotubes with open
edges. We demonstrate that carbon nanotubes provide a stabilization mechanism
for quasi-one-dimensional molecular chains via the formation of their secondary
structures. In particular, a polypeptide chain (Gly)$_N$ placed inside a carbon
nanotube can form of a stable helical chain ($3_{10}$, $\alpha$, $\pi$ and
$\beta$-helix) with parallel chains of hydrogen-bonded peptide groups. A chain
of hydrogen fluoride molecules can form hydrogen-bonded zigzag chain. We reveal
that in such geometries the hydrogen-bonded chains may remain stable even at
$T=500$~K. Thus, our results suggest that the use of carbon nanotubes with
encapsulated hydrogen fluoride molecules may support high proton conductivity
operating at high temperatures.

<h3>Etching of elemental layers in oxide molecular beam epitaxy by  O2-assisted formation and evaporation of their volatile suboxide: The  examples of Ga and Ge</h3>

<br>
<i>Wenshan Chen, Kingsley Egbo, Huaide Zhang, Andrea Ardenghi, Oliver Bierwagen</i>
<p>The delivery of an elemental cation flux to the substrate surface in the
oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) chamber has been utilized not only for the
epitaxial growth of oxide thin films in the presence of oxygen but also in the
absence of oxygen for the growth temperature calibration (by determining the
adsorption temperature of the elements) and in-situ etching of oxide layers (e.
g., Ga2O3 etched by Ga). These elemental fluxes may, however, leave unwanted
cation adsorbates or droplets on the surface, which traditionally require
removal by in-situ superheating or ex-situ wet-chemical etching with
potentially surface-degrading effects. This study demonstrates a universal
in-situ approach to remove the residual cation elements from the surface via
conversion into a volatile suboxide by a molecular O2-flux in an MBE system
followed by suboxide evaporation at temperatures significantly below the
elemental evaporation temperature. We experimentally investigate the in-situ
etching of Ga and Ge cation layers and their etching efficiency using in-situ
line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) and reflection high-energy
electron diffraction (RHEED). The application of this process is demonstrated
by the in-situ removal of residual Ga droplets from a SiO2 mask after
structuring a Ga2O3 layer by in-situ Ga-etching. This approach can be generally
applied in MBE and MOCVD to remove residual elements with vapor pressure lower
than that of their suboxides, such as B, In, La, Si, Sn, Sb, Mo, Nb, Ru, Ta, V,
and W.

<p>We have investigated the vortex dynamics in a thin film of an iron-based
superconductor FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ by observing second-harmonic generation
(SHG) in the THz frequency range. We visualized the picosecond trajectory of
two-dimensional vortex motion in a pinning potential tilted by Meissner
shielding current. The SHG perpendicular to the driving field is observed,
corresponding to the nonreciprocal nonlinear Hall effect under the
current-induced inversion symmetry breaking, whereas the linear Hall effect is
negligible. The estimated vortex mass, as light as a bare electron, suggests
that the vortex core moves independently from quasiparticles at such a high
frequency and large velocity $\approx$300 km/s.

<p>[(SnSe)$_{1+\delta}$]$_m$(NbSe$_2$) ($m$ = 1-6, 8, and 12) highly orientated

stacked layers along the $c$ axis in the obtained crystals were directly

and single layers of NbSe$_2$. The superconducting transition temperature of
the obtained [(SnSe)$_{1+\delta}$]$_m$(NbSe$_2$) crystals decreased with an
increase in the number of SnSe layers per unit cell. As the superconducting
anisotropy parameters increase, a significant increase is observed between $m =

<p>Efficient methods for generating samples of wave packet trajectories are
needed to build machine learning models for quantum dynamics. However,
simulating such data by direct integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation can be demanding, especially when multiple spatial dimensions and
realistic potentials are involved. In this paper, we present a graphics
processor unit (GPU) implementation of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
method for simulating the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The performance
of our implementation is characterized in detail by simulating electron
diffraction from realistic material surfaces. On our hardware, our GPU
implementation achieves a roughly 350 times performance increase compared to a
serial CPU implementation. The suitability of our implementation for generating
samples of quantum dynamics data is also demonstrated by performing electron
diffraction simulations from multiple configurations of an organic thin film.
By studying how the structure of the data converges with sample sizes, we
acquire insights into the sample sizes required for machine learning purposes.

<p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) refer to alloys composed of five or more elements
in equal or near-equal amounts or in an atomic concentration range of 5 to 35
atomic percent (at%). Different elemental ratios will affect the
microstructures of HEAs and provide them with unique properties. Based on past
research, HEAs have exhibited superior performance, relative to most
conventional alloys, with respect to many properties, such as strength,
toughness, corrosion resistance, magnetic behavior, etc. Among them, fatigue
behavior has been a topic of focus, due to its importance in industrial
applications. In this article, we summarized the research progress in the
HEA-fatigue behavior in the past ten years, including experimental results and
theoretical studies in subdivisions, such as high-cycle fatigue, low-cycle
fatigue, fatigue-crack growth, fatigue mechanisms, etc. The influence of the
processing and test methods on HEAs is described. The accuracy of several
commonly used prediction models is also outlined. Finally, unresolved issues
and suggestions on the direction of future research efforts are presented.

<h3>Spontaneous Supersymmetry Breaking and Nambu-Goldstone Modes in  Interacting Majorana Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07419</a>
<br>
<i>Noriaki Sannomiya</i>
<p>In modern physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the most important
and ubiquitous ideas. It is well known that the breakdown of global and
continuous symmetry gives rise to gapless excitations called Nambu-Goldstone
(NG) bosons. This is called NG theorem. Since the generators of broken
symmetries are bosonic, the excitations are also bosons. On the other hand,
excitations are thought of as fermionic when a generator of broken symmetry is
fermionic. The most famous example of fermionic symmetry is supersymmetry
(SUSY). SUSY is a symmetry that exchanges bosons and fermions. In high-energy
physics, it is known that spontaneous SUSY breaking gives rise to massless
modes called NG fermions or Nambu- Goldstinos. In non-relativistic systems,
fewer examples of models with SUSY are studied. Therefore, spontaneous SUSY
breaking in non-relativistic systems is less understood than that in
nonrelativistic systems or spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this thesis, we
introduce interacting Majorana models with supersymmetry (SUSY) and discuss the
properties in terms of spontaneous SUSY breaking and NG modes.

<h3>Chiral spin liquid and quantum phase diagram of spin-$1/2$  $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07461" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07461</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao-Tian Zhang, Yixuan Huang, Han-Qing Wu, D. N. Sheng, Shou-Shu Gong</i>
<p>We study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice with the first
and second nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings $J_1$, $J_2$, as well
as the three-spin scalar chiral coupling $J_{\chi}$. Using density matrix
renormalization group calculations, we obtain a quantum phase diagram of this
system for $0 \leq J_2/J_1 \leq 1.0$ and $0 \leq J_{\chi}/J_1 \leq 1.5$. We
identify the N\'eel and stripe magnetic order phase at small $J_{\chi}$
coupling. With growing $J_{\chi}$, we identify the emergent chiral spin liquid
(CSL) phase characterized by the quantized spin Chern number $C = 1/2$ and
entanglement spectrum with the quasidegenerate group of levels agreeing with
chiral SU(2)$_1$ conformal field theory, which is an analog of the $\nu = 1/2$
Laughlin state in spin system. In the vicinity of the N\'eel and CSL phase
boundary, our numerical results do not find evidence to support the phase
coexistence of N\'eel order and topological order that was conjectured by
mean-field calculations. In the larger $J_2$ and $J_{\chi}$ coupling regime,
the entanglement spectrum of the ground state also exhibits the chiral
quasidegeneracy consistent with a CSL, but the adiabatic flux insertion
simulations fail to obtain the quantized Chern number. By analyzing the
finite-size scaling of magnetic order parameter, we find the vanished magnetic
order suggesting a magnetic disorder phase, whose nature needs further studies.
Different from the spin-$1$ $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_\chi$ model, we do not find the
coexistent stripe magnetic order and topological order. We also investigate the
$J_{\chi}$ dominant regime and find a strong tendency of the system to develop
a dimer order rather than the chiral spin magnetic order observed in the
spin-$1$ model.

<i>Fan Zhang, Wenan Guo, Ribhu Kaul</i>
<p>We study a generalization of the well-known classical two-dimensional square
lattice compass model of XY spins (sometimes referred to as the 90$^\circ$
compass model), which interpolates between the XY model and the compass model.
Our model possesses the combined $C_4$ lattice and spin rotation symmetry of
the compass model but is free of its fine-tuned subsystem symmetries. Using
both field theoretic arguments and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that our
model possesses a line of critical points with continuously varying exponents
of the Ashkin-Teller type terminating at the four-state Potts point. Further,
our Monte Carlo study uncovers that beyond the four-state Potts point, the line
of phase transition is connected to the lattice-nematic Ising phase transition
in the square lattice compass model through a region of first-order
transitions.

<h3>Room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism of two-dimensional Na2Cl  crystals originated by s- and p-orbitals</h3>

<p>Ferromagnetism, as one of the most valuable properties of materials, has
attracted sustained and widespread interest in basic and applied research from
ancient compasses to modern electronic devices. Traditionally, intrinsic
ferromagnetism has been attributed to the permanent magnetic moment induced by
partially filled d- or f-orbitals. However, the development of ferromagnetic
materials has been limited by this electronic structure convention. Thus, the
identification of additional materials that are not constrained by this
conventional rule but also exhibit intrinsic ferromagnetism is highly expected
and may impact all the fields based on ferromagnetism. Here, we report the
direct observation of room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism in
two-dimensional (2D) Na2Cl crystals, in which there are only partially filled
s- and p-orbitals rather than d- or f-orbitals, using the superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) and magnetic force microscope (MFM). These
Na2Cl crystals formed in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) membranes have an
unconventional stoichiometric structure leading to unique electron and spin
distributions. And the structure of these 2D Na2Cl crystals, including the Na
and Cl sites, is characterized in situ for the first time and directly observed
by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) based on the observed difference in
contrast between Na stacked with Cl and single Na. These findings break the
conventional rule of intrinsic ferromagnetism and provide new insights into the
design of novel magnetic and electronic devices and transistors with a size
down to the atomic scale.

<h3>Evidence of Scaling Regimes in the Hopfield Dynamics of Whole Brain  Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07538</a>
<br>
<i>Giorgio Gosti, Sauro Succi, Giancarlo Ruocco</i>
<p>It is shown that a Hopfield recurrent neural network, informed by
experimentally derived brain topology, recovers the scaling picture recently
introduced by Deco et al., according to which the process of information
transfer within the human brain shows spatially correlated patterns
qualitatively similar to those displayed by turbulent flows. Although both
models employ a coupling strength which decays exponentially with the euclidean
distance between the nodes, their mathematical nature is widely different, Hopf
oscillators versus Hopfield neural network. Hence, their convergence suggests a
remarkable robustness of the aforementioned scaling picture. Furthermore, the
present analysis shows that the Hopfield model brain remains functional by
removing links above about five decay lengths, corresponding to about one sixth
of the size of the global brain. This suggests that, in terms of connectivity
decay length, the Hopfield brain functions in a sort of intermediate "turbulent
liquid"-like state, whose essential connections are the intermediate ones
between the connectivity decay length and the global brain size. This
"turbulent-like liquid" appears to be more spiky than actual turbulent fluids,
with a scaling exponent around $2/5$ instead of $2/3$.

<h3>The low-spin ground state of the giant Mn wheels</h3>

<br>
<i>R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</i>
<p>The single-molecule magnets (SMMs) {Mn$_{70}$} and {Mn$_{84}$} are
characterized by a 14-site unit cell with $S=2$ spin sites, arranged in a
circular geometry. Experimentally, these SMMs exhibit a magnetic ground state
with a notably low total spin, $S_{\text{tot}}=5-7$. This low-spin ground state
has been up to now difficult to describe theoretically due to the complexity of
the quantum Heisenberg model for this large system. In this work, we are in
fact able to quantitatively reproduce the low-spin energy minimum by employing
large-scale SU(2)-symmetric density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
calculations using previously published exchange parameters obtained by
density-functional theory. We do not find a low-spin state for the same
parameters and $S=1$, which leads us to propose that frustrated systems with
$S\geq2$ are inherently prone to weak ferromagnetic interactions. This could
account for the prevalence of similar low-spin Mn-based SMMs. Finally, by
computing the full magnetization curve, we find wide plateaus at 10/14, 11/14,
12/14 and 13/14 of the saturation. This can be explained by independent 3-site
clusters with broken inter-cluster bonds.

<h3>Sensing magnetic flux of Langmuir-Blodgett films of a molecular magnetic  system using superconducting films and nano-SQUID devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07566" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07566</a>
<br>
<i>Bibekananda Das, Tapas Senapati, Malaya K. Sahoo, Jogendra N. Behera, Kartik Senapati</i>
<p>We report a study on the response of superconducitng micro-tracks and quantum
interference devices (SQUIDs) to a proximal SMM film. As a test case,
Langmuir-Blodgett $Mn_{12}$-ac SMM films have been grown on 2 $\mu$m wide Nb
tracks and Nb nano-SQUIDs to observe the proximity effect of magnetic moment
and magnetization tunneling, respectively. The superconducting critical
temperature of thin Nb tracks (thinner than the coherence length of Nb) were
found to decrease by the magnetic moment of $Mn_{12}$-ac SMM. Following the
thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) model, we found an increase in the vortex
unbinding energy of the SMM coated Nb tracks, near critical temperature. More
importantly, the random alignment of moments of the $Mn_{12}$-ac molecules at
low fields seemed to have the enhancing effect on vortex unbinding energy
rather than the saturated state of $Mn_{12}$-ac molecules at high fields. In
the fully superconducting state, on the other hand, the vortex pinning effects
were found to be more effective in the saturated state of the $Mn_{12}$-ac
molecules, as seen from magnetoresistance and field dependent critical current
measurements. In a separate experiment, a Langmuir-Blodgett film of SMM was
grown on a nano-SQUID to look for local changes in magnetization arising from
magnetizatin tunnelling phenomenon in SMMs. Upon magnetizing the SMM (deposited
on SQUIDs) at 2 K along the plane of the film and allowing it to relax, we
found occasional jumps in the underlying SQUID voltage, unlike bare
nano-SQUIDs, which did not show any such jumps over several hours. Therefore,
we believe that the jumps in the SQUID voltage are the signatures of random
tunneling of magnetization in the SMM layer.

<h3>Meta-generalized-gradient exchange-correlation functionals for  spin-orbit coupled electrons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07581" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07581</a>
<br>
<i>Jacques K. Desmarais, Jefferson Maul, Bartolomeo Civalleri, Alessandro Erba, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis</i>
<p>The prominence of density functional theory (DFT) in the field of electronic
structure computation stems from its ability to usefully balance accuracy and
computational effort. At the base of this ability is a functional of the
electron density: the exchange-correlation (xc) energy. This functional
satisfies known exact conditions that guide the derivation of approximations.
The strongly-constrained-appropriately-normed (SCAN) approximation stands out
as a successful, modern, example. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling,
however, the xc energy must depend not only on the electron density but also on
spin currents -- a fact which is not captured by SCAN or by any mainstream
functional approximation. In this work, we demonstrate how the SU(2)
gauge-invariance of the {\em exact} functional allows us to add the necessary
dependence on spin currents in the SCAN functional (here called JSCAN) -- and
similar meta-generalized-gradient functional approximations -- in a
non-empirical manner. The prescription further ensures that the conjugate
xc-fields of the spin currents have vanishing local torques as in the exact
case. In passing, a spin-current dependent generalization of the electron
localization function (here called JELF) is also derived. The extended forms
are implemented in a developer's version of the \textsc{Crystal23} program.
Applications on molecules and materials confirm the practical relevance of the
extensions.

<h3>Exploring pNIPAM Lyogels for SMART Reactors: Experimental Study on  Swelling Equilibria in Various Organic Solvents and Mixtures, Supported by  COSMO-RS Analysis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07592" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07592</a>
<br>
<i>Kathrin Marina Eckert, Simon Müller, Gerrit A. Luinstra, Irina Smirnova</i>
<p>Stimuli-responsive lyogels are considered to be smart materials due to their
capability of undergoing significant macroscopic changes in response to
external triggers. Due to their versatile and unique properties, smart lyogels
exhibit great potential in various applications such as drug delivery or
actuation processes. While Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM) is widely known
as a thermo-responsive material, it also shows significant solvent-responsive
swelling behavior. As polar solvents induce strong swelling due to hydrogen
bonding with the amide group, nonpolar solvents lead to significant shrinkage
of the lyogels. The aim of this study is to investigate and to model this
behavior for future application in chemical or biochemical reactors. As a
current area of research, incorporating smart hydrogel technology into
(bio-)chemical reactors facilitates the development of smart reactor systems.
Applying thermodynamic modelling with the gE model COSMO-RS on the monomer or
oligomers of pNIPAM, the correlation between solvent-polymer interactions and
the degree of swelling can be observed. pNIPAM derivatives exhibit low
infinitive dilution activity coefficients (IDACs) in polar solvents with large
degrees of swelling, while displaying an increase of IDACs in nonpolar
solvents. Hydrogen bonds dominate the swelling behavior of lyogels not only in
pure solvents but also in mixtures of solvents with varying polarity. Even in
mixtures containing high amounts of nonpolar solvents, large degrees of
swelling were observed due to the uptake of the polar solvent in the lyogel
matrix. This effect can be observed in binary solvent mixtures but also in
representative mixtures along an esterification reaction with varying
carboxylic chain length of alcohol and carboxylic acids.

<h3>Probing relativistic electrons in the Weyl semimetal NbP using  transverse electron focusing</h3>

<p>Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are topological semimetals characterized by
exceptional transport properties, including extremely high mobility,
magnetoresistance, and electrical conductivity, all of which hold great promise
for technological applications. However, the connection between the extreme
transport properties of WSMs to the distinctive features of the Weyl Fermi
surface, characterized by relativistic, chiral bulk states and topological
surface states, remains experimentally unexplored. To gain deeper insights into
the properties of Weyl fermions and their contribution to transport, we employ
a combined approach of transverse electron focusing (TEF) and Shubnikov de Haas
(SdH) experiments conducted on microstructured single-crystals of the WSM
niobium phosphide (NbP). TEF and SdH generate distinct signals for charged
quasiparticles with different momenta and Fermi surface areas, respectively,
thereby enabling focused study on Weyl fermions in a material like NbP, where
several types of carriers, both topological and not, contribute to transport
simultaneously. The combination of TEF and SdH allows measuring Weyl Fermi
surface characteristics with a sensitivity beyond angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. Moreover, carriers' density, type, mass, and mobility can be
extracted, giving valuable insights into Weyl fermions transport properties.
Our findings support that the extreme mobility of NbP originates from bulk,
achiral, and relativistic electrons.

<p>SnS2 stands out as a highly promising two-dimensional material with
significant potential for applications in the field of electronics. Numerous
attempts have been undertaken to modulate the physical properties of SnS2 by
doping with various metal ions. Here, we deposited a series of Sb-doped SnS2
via atomic layer deposition (ALD) super-cycle process and compared its
crystallinity, composition, and optical properties to those of pristine SnS2.
We found that the increase in the concentration of Sb is accompanied by a
gradual reduction in the Sn and S binding energies. The work function is
increased upon Sb doping from 4.32 eV (SnS2) to 4.75 eV (Sb-doped SnS2 with 9:1
ratio). When integrated into photodetectors, the Sb-doped SnS2 showed improved
performances, demonstrating increased peak photoresponsivity values from 19.5
A/W to 27.8 A/W at 405 nm, accompanied by an improvement in response speed.
These results offer valuable insights into next-generation optoelectronic
applications based on SnS2.

This study thoroughly investigates largely unexplored breathing Kagome

compounds, exhibiting type-II superconductivity with critical temperature
(T$_{C}$) values of 2.90(3) K and 2.69(6) K, respectively. Furthermore,
specific heat measurements and an electron-phonon coupling constant suggest the

specific heat, and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements.
Specific heat and transverse field $\mu$SR measurements suggest moderately
coupled fully gapped superconductivity, well described by BCS theory. However,
our zero-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal a small internal field onsetting
around the superconducting T$_c$, indicating that the superconducting order
parameter breaks the time-reversal symmetry.

<h3>Impact of boron atom clustering on the electronic structure of (B,In)N  alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07623</a>
<br>
<i>Cara-Lena Nies, Stefan Schulz</i>
<p>Tailoring the electronic and optical properties of nitride-based alloys for
optoelectronic applications in the ultraviolet and red spectral range has
attracted significant attention in recent years. Adding boron nitride (BN) to
indium gallium nitride, (In,Ga)N, alloys, can help to control the lattice
mismatch between (In,Ga)N and GaN and may thus allow reduction of strain
related defect formation. However, understanding of the impact of BN on the
electronic properties of III-N alloys, in particular the influence of
experimentally observed boron atom clustering, is sparse. This work presents
first-principles calculations investigating the electronic properties of
(B,In)N alloys with boron contents between 2% and 7%. Special attention is paid
to the impact of the alloy microstructure. While the results show that the
lattice constants of such alloys largely agree with lattice constants
determined from a Vegard approximation, the electronic properties strongly
depend on the local boron atom configurations. For instance, if boron atoms are
dispersed throughout the structure and are not sharing nitrogen atoms, the band
gap of (B,In)N alloys is largely unaffected and stays close to the gap of
pristine InN. However, in the case of boron atom clustering, e.g., when boron
atoms are sharing nitrogen atoms, the band gap can be strongly reduced, often
leading to a metallic state in (B,In)N alloys. These strong band gap reductions
are mainly driven by carrier localization effects in the valence band. The
calculations thus show that the electronic structure of (B,In)N alloys strongly
depends on the alloy microstructure and that boron atom clustering plays an
important role in understanding the electronic and optical properties of these
emerging materials.

<h3>Passive particle in an active bath: How can we tell it is out of  equilibrium?</h3>

<br>
<i>Jeanine Shea, Gerhard Jung, Friederike Schmid</i>
<p>We study a passive probe immersed in a fluid of active particles. Despite the
system's non-equilibrium nature, the trajectory of the probe does not exhibit
non-equilibrium signatures: its velocity distribution remains Gaussian, the
second fluctuation dissipation theorem is not fundamentally violated, and the
motion does not indicate breaking of time reversal symmetry. To tell that the
probe is out of equilibrium requires examination of its behavior in tandem with
that of the active fluid: the kinetic temperature of the probe does not
equilibrate to that of the surrounding active particles. As a strategy to
diagnose non-equilibrium from probe trajectories alone, we propose to examine
their response to a small perturbation which reveals a non-equilibrium
signature through a violation of the first fluctuation dissipation theorem.

<i>S. W. Lovesey</i>
<p>The enantiomorphous (chiral) crystal class of the Sohncke-type insulator
Pb(TiO)Cu4(PO4)4 permits the rotation of the plane of polarization of light
(optical activity). Copper ions participate in antiferromagnetic order below a
temperature 7 K, with magnetoelectric and piezomagnetic effects permitted.
Lattice and magnetic symmetries of Pb(TiO)Cu4(PO4)4 are fully incorporated in
calculated resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction patterns that are successfully
compared with existing limited measurements on paramagnetic and magnetically
ordered Pb(TiO)Cu4(PO4)4 [Misawa et al. Phys. Rev. B 103, 174409 (2021)].
Specifically, there is additional intensity in the ordered phase to a Bragg
spot (a chiral signature) from circular polarization in the primary beam of
x-rays. It is created by Cu axial magnetic dipoles, with the prospect of future
experiments revealing interference between magnetic dipoles and charge-like
(time-even, Templeton-Templeton) quadrupoles. Polar and magnetic (parity- and
time-odd) Dirac quadrupoles and octupoles are potentially strong sources of
diffraction when the reflection vector is parallel to the unique direction in
the tetragonal lattice.

<br>
<i>Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin</i>
<p>Fully-augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) was proposed recently (Chin.
Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)) as an accurate numerical tool to study
two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. It is constructed by including a
disentangler layer upon MPS. The cost of simulating quantum models with FAMPS
is similar as DMRG (with small overhead), but FAMPS can support area-law
entanglement entropy for two-dimensional systems. These properties make FAMPS
an effective and efficient tool. In this work, we demonstrate that for each
FAMPS we can construct a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with the FAMPS being its
ground state. We show how to construct the parent Hamiltonian for given FAMPS.
We also perform numerical simulation to show that the algorithm proposed in
Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023) can find the exact FAMPS for the parent
Hamiltonian. FAMPS and the corresponding parent Hamiltonian provides a useful
framework for the future study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems

<i>Antonio Suma, Daniel Sigg, Seamus Gallagher, Giuseppe Gonnella, Vincenzo Carnevale</i>
<p>Much progress has been made in elucidating the inner workings of
voltage-gated ion channels, but less understood is the influence of lipid rafts
on gating kinetics. Here we propose that state-dependent channel affinity for
different lipid species provides a unified explanation for the experimentally
observed behaviors of clustering, cooperativity, and hysteresis. We develop
models of diffusing lipids and channels engaged in Ising-like interactions to
investigate the collective behaviors driven by raft formation in critical
membranes close to the demixing transition. The model channels demonstrate
lipid-mediated long-range interactions, activation curve steepening, and
long-term memory in ionic currents. These behaviors likely play a role in
channel-mediated cellular signaling and suggest a universal mechanism for
self-organization of biomolecular assemblies.

<p>Disordering of solids typically leads to amorphization, but polymorph
transitions, facilitated by favorable atomic rearrangements, may temporarily
help to maintain long-range periodicity in the solid state. In
far-from-equilibrium situations, such as atomic collision cascades, these
rearrangements may not necessarily follow a thermodynamically gainful path, but
may be kinetically limited. In this work, we focused on such crystallization
instead of amorphization in collision cascades in gallium oxide. We determined
the disorder threshold for irreversible polymorph transition and explained why
it results in elevating energy to that of the {\gamma}-polymorph, which
exhibits the highest polymorph energy in the system below the amorphous state.
Specifically, we demonstrate that upon reaching the disorder transition
threshold, the Ga-sublattice kinetically favors transitioning to the
{\gamma}-like configuration, requiring significantly less migration for Ga
atoms to reach the lattice sites during post-cascade processes. As such, our
data provide a consistent explanation of this remarkable phenomenon and can
serve as a toolbox for predictive multi-polymorph fabrication.

<p>Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) present an intriguing
platform for exploring excitons and their transport properties. By introducing
a twist angle, a moir\'e superlattice forms, providing a spatially dependent
exciton energy landscape. Based on a microscopic many-particle theory, we
investigate in this work polaron-induced changes in exciton transport
properties in the MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We demonstrate that polaron
formation and the associated enhancement of moir\'e excitonic mass lead to a
significant band flattening. As a result, the hopping rate and the propagation
velocity undergo noticeable temperature and twist-angle dependent changes. We
predict a reduction of the hopping strength ranging from 80% at a twist angle
of 1$^\circ$ to 30% at 3$^\circ$ at room temperature. The provided microscopic
insights into the spatio-temporal exciton dynamics in presence of a moir\'e
potential further deepens our understanding of the intriguing moir\'e exciton
physics.

<i>Yanting Cheng, Hui Zhai</i>
<p>Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a novel platform exhibiting rich quantum
many-body physics and offering promise for universal quantum computation. The
Rydberg blockade effect plays an essential role in establishing many-body
correlations in this system. In this review, we will highlight that the lattice
gauge theory is an efficient description of the Rydberg blockade effect and
overview recent exciting developments in this system from equilibrium phases to
quantum dynamics. These developments include realizing exotic ground states
such as spin liquids, discovering quantum many-body scar states violating
quantum thermalization, and observing confinement-deconfinement transition
through quantum dynamics. We emphasize that the gauge theory description offers
a universal theoretical framework to capture all these phenomena. This
perspective of Rydberg atom arrays will inspire further the future development
of quantum simulation and quantum computation in this platform.

<p>Gate-defined quantum dots define an attractive platform for quantum
computation and have been used to confine individual charges in a planar array.
Here, we demonstrate control over vertical double quantum dots confined in a
double quantum well, silicon-germanium heterostructure. We sense individual
charge transitions with a single-hole transistor. The vertical separation
between the quantum wells provides a sufficient difference in capacitive
coupling to distinguish quantum dots located in the top and bottom quantum
well. Tuning the vertical double quantum dot to the (1,1) charge state confines
a single hole in each quantum well beneath a single plunger gate. By
simultaneously accumulating holes under two neighbouring plunger gates, we are
able to tune to the (1,1,1,1) charge state. These results motivate quantum dot
systems that exploit the third dimension, opening new opportunities for quantum
simulation and quantum computing.

<h3>Theoretical Design of Mono-Elemental Ferroelectricity with Tunable Spin  Textures in Bilayer Tellurium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07752" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07752</a>
<br>
<i>Jiajun Zhu, Botao Fu, Heyun Zhao, Wanbiao Hu</i>
<p>2D Ferroelectricity with switchable electric polarization has drawn
widespread attention in condensed matter physics due to its crucial
applications in non-volatile memory and ferroelectric spin devices. Despite
recent progress in 2D ferroelectric, achieving the mono-elemental
ferroelectricity still remains a great challenge because most nonmetallic
mono-elemental materials are stabilized in nonpolar crystal structures. In this
work, we theoretically designed mono-elemental ferroelectricity with tunable
and significant spin textures in bilayer tellurium (BL-Te). Comprehensive
quantitative polarization calculations demonstrate that asymmetric stacking in
BL-Te can generate out-of-plane (OOP) polarization with a magnitude of 0.78
pC/m. This polarization stems from distinguishing interlayer and intra-layer
contributions. Moreover, these stacked BL-Te, characterized by significant
spin-orbit coupling, serve as an ideal platform for investigating both
conventional spin polarization and layer-dependent/hidden spin polarization
through ferroelectric reversion. Our work not only broaden the category of 2D
mono-elemental ferroelectric but also offer a new platform for multifunctional
nanodevices.

<i>Huan-Bo Luo, Lu Li, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li, Bin Liu</i>
<p>We investigate vortex states in Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined
action of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), gradient magnetic field, and
harmonic-oscillator trapping potential. The linear version of the system is
solved exactly. Through the linear-spectrum analysis, we find that, varying the
SOC strength and magnetic-field gradient, one can perform energy-level
inversion. With suitable parameters, initial higher-order vortex states can be
made the ground state (GS). The nonlinear system is solved numerically,
revealing that the results are consistent with the linear predictions in the
case of repulsive inter-component interactions. On the other hand,
inter-component attraction creates the GS in the form of mixed-mode states in a
vicinity of the GS phase-transition points. The spin texture of both vortex-
and mixed-mode GSs reveals that they feature the structure of 2D (baby)
skyrmions.

<p>Properties of high entropy alloys are currently in the spotlight due to their
promising applications. One of the least investigated aspects is the affinity
of these alloys to hydrogen, its diffusion and reactions. In this study we
apply high-pressure at ambient temperature and investigate stress-induced
diffusion of hydrogen into the tructure of high entropy alloys HEA including
the famous Cantor alloy as well as less known, but nevertheless important
platinum group PGM alloys. By applying X-ray diffraction to samples loaded into
diamond anvil cells we perform a comparative investigation of these HEA alloys
in Ne and H2 pressure-transmitting media. Surprisingly, even under stresses far
exceeding conventional industrial processes both Cantor and PGM alloys show
exceptional resistance to hydride formation, on par with widely used industrial
grade CuBe alloys. Our observations inspire optimism for practical HEA
applications in hydrogen-relevant industry and technology e.g. coatings, etc,
particularly those related to transport and storage.

<h3>Predicting heteropolymer interactions: demixing and hypermixing of  disordered protein sequences</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07826" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07826</a>
<br>
<i>Kyosuke Adachi, Kyogo Kawaguchi</i>
<p>Cells contain multiple condensates which spontaneously form due to the
heterotypic interactions between their components. Although the proteins and
disordered region sequences that are responsible for condensate formation have
been extensively studied, the rule of interactions between the components that
allow demixing, i.e., the coexistence of multiple condensates, is yet to be
elucidated. Here we construct an effective theory of the interaction between
heteropolymers by fitting it to the molecular dynamics simulation results
obtained for more than 200 sequences sampled from the disordered regions of
human proteins. We find that the sum of amino acid pair interactions across two
heteropolymers predicts the Boyle temperature qualitatively well, which can be
quantitatively improved by the dimer pair approximation, where we incorporate
the effect of neighboring amino acids in the sequences. The improved theory,
combined with the finding of a metric that captures the effective interaction
strength between distinct sequences, allowed the selection of up to three
disordered region sequences that demix with each other in multicomponent
simulations, as well as the generation of artificial sequences that demix with
a given sequence. The theory points to a generic sequence design strategy to
demix or hypermix thanks to the low dimensional nature of the space of the
interactions that we identify. As a consequence of the geometric arguments in
the space of interactions, we find that the number of distinct sequences that
can demix with each other is strongly constrained, irrespective of the choice
of the coarse-grained model. Altogether, we construct a theoretical basis for
methods to estimate the effective interaction between heteropolymers, which can
be utilized in predicting phase separation properties as well as rules of
assignment in the localization and functions of disordered proteins.

<p>Recent research has revealed remarkable properties of the two-dimensional
(2D) van der Waals layered crystal CrSBr, which is both a semiconductor and an
A-type antiferromagnet. Here we show the role of strong magnetoelastic coupling
in the generation and propagation of coherent magnons in CrSBr. Time and
spatially resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (tr-MOKE) microscopy reveals two
time-varying transient strain fields induced by out-of-plane transverse and
in-plane longitudinal lattice displacements. These transient strain fields
launch coherent wavepackets of magnons, optical and acoustic at 24.6 GHz and
33.4 GHz, respectively. These findings suggest mechanisms for controlling and
manipulating coherent magnons from distinct magnetoelastic couplings in this 2D
van der Waals magnetic semiconductor.

<br>
<i>M. Smith, V. L. Quito, A. A. Burkov, P. P. Orth, I. Martin</i>
<p>We present a theory for thin films of the Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ in the
presence of magnetic fields. We show that, above a critical thickness, specific
subbands $n$ of thin film Cd$_3$As$_2$ are in a quantum spin Hall insulator
regime and study their response to in- and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We
find that sufficiently large in-plane Zeeman fields drive the system toward a
2D Dirac semimetal regime, provided the field is directed perpendicular to a
high-symmetry mirror plane. For other directions, we find the Dirac points to
be weakly gapped. We further investigate how the system responds to finite
out-of-plane field components, both starting from the quantum spin Hall regime
at small in-plane fields and from the 2D Dirac semimetal regimes at larger
in-plane fields, addressing recent experimental observations in [A. C. Lygo et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 046201 (2023)] and [B. Guo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.

<p>Sound can exert forces on objects of any material and shape. This has made
the contactless manipulation of objects by intense ultrasound a fascinating
area of research with wide-ranging applications. While much is understood for
acoustic forcing of individual objects, sound-mediated interactions among
multiple objects at close range gives rise to a rich set of structures and
dynamics that are less explored and have been emerging as a frontier for
research. We introduce the basic mechanisms giving rise to sound-mediated
interactions among rigid as well as deformable particles, focusing on the
regime where the particles' size and spacing are much smaller than the sound
wavelength. The interplay of secondary acoustic scattering, Bjerknes forces,
and micro-streaming is discussed and the role of particle shape is highlighted.
Furthermore, we present recent advances in characterizing non-conservative and
non-pairwise additive contributions to the particle interactions, along with
instabilities and active fluctuations. These excitations emerge at sufficiently
strong sound energy density and can act as an effective temperature in
otherwise athermal systems.

<p>First order phase transitions in the very early universe are a prediction of
many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics and could provide the
departure from equilibrium needed for a dynamical explanation of the baryon
asymmetry of the Universe. They could also produce gravitational waves of a
frequency observable by future space-based detectors such as the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). All calculations of the gravitational wave
power spectrum rely on a relativistic version of the classical nucleation
theory of Cahn-Hilliard and Langer, due to Coleman and Linde. The high purity
and precise control of pressure and temperature achievable in the laboratory
made the first-order A to B transition of superfluid $^3$He an ideal for test
of classical nucleation theory. As Leggett and others have noted the theory
fails dramatically. The lifetime of the metastable A phase is measurable,
typically of order minutes to hours, far faster than classical nucleation
theory predicts. If the nucleation of B phase from the supercooled A phase is
due to a new, rapid intrinsic mechanism that would have implications for
first-order cosmological phase transitions as well as predictions for
gravitational wave (GW) production in the early universe. Here we discuss
studies of the AB phase transition dynamics in $^3$He, both experimental and
theoretical, and show how the computational technology for cosmological phase
transition can be used to simulate the dynamics of the A-B transition, support
the experimental investigations of the A-B transition in the QUEST-DMC
collaboration with the goal of identifying and quantifying the mechanism(s)
responsible for nucleation of stable phases in ultra-pure metastable quantum
phases.

<h3>Programming bistability in geometrically perturbed mechanical  metamaterials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07881" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07881</a>
<br>
<i>Yingchao Peng, Imtiar Niloy, Megan Kam, Paolo Celli, Paul Plucinsky</i>
<p>Mechanical metamaterials capable of large deformations are an emerging
platform for functional devices and structures across scales. Bistable designs
are particularly attractive since they endow a single object with two
configurations that display distinct shapes, properties and functionalities. We
propose a strategy that takes a common (non-bistable) metamaterial design and
transforms it into a bistable one, specifically, by allowing for irregular
patterns through geometric perturbations of the unit cell and by leveraging the
intercell constraints inherent to the large deformation response of
metamaterials. We exemplify this strategy by producing a design framework for
bistable planar kirigami metamaterials starting from the canonical
rotating-squares pattern. The framework comprises explicit design formulas for
cell-based kirigami with unprecedented control over the shape of the two stable
states, and an optimization methodology that allows for efficient tailoring of
the geometric features of the designs to achieve target elastic properties as
well as shape change. The versatility of this framework is illustrated through
a wide variety of examples, including non-periodic designs that achieve two
arbitrarily-shaped stable states. Quantitative and qualitative experiments,
featuring prototypes with distinct engineering design details, complement the
theory and shine light on the strengths and limitations of our design approach.
These results show how to design bistable metamaterials from non-bistable
templates, paving the way for further discovery of bistable systems and
structures that are not simply arrangements of known bistable units.

<p>Schwarzites are porous (spongy-like) carbon allotropes with negative Gaussian
curvatures. They were proposed by Mackay and Terrones inspired by the works of
the German mathematician Hermann Schwarz on Triply-Periodic Minimal Surfaces
(TPMS). This review presents and discusses the history of schwarzites and their
place among curved carbon nanomaterials. We summarized the main works on
schwarzites available in the literature. We discuss their unique structural,
electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties. Although the synthesis of
carbon-based schwarzites remains elusive, the recent advances in the synthesis
of zeolite-templates nanomaterials bring them closer to reality. Atomic-based
models of schwarzites have been translated into macroscale ones that have been
3D printed. These 3D printed models have been exploited in many real-world
applications, including water remediation and biomedical ones.

<h3>Conductivity scaling and absence of localization in disordered nodal  line semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Carolina Paiva, Jan Behrends</i>
<p>Transport plays a key role in characterizing topological insulators and
semimetals. Understanding the effect of disorder is crucial to assess the
robustness of experimental signatures for topology. In this work, we find the
absence of localization in nodal line semimetals for long-range scalar disorder
and a large range of disorder strengths. Using a continuum transfer matrix
approach, we find that the conductivity in the plane and out of the plane of
the nodal line increases with system size and disorder strength. We
substantiate these findings by a perturbative calculation and show that the
conductivity increases with disorder strength using the Kubo formula in the
self-consistent Born approximation. We also find that the system remains
metallic for vector disorder and that vector disorder can drive a transition
from an insulating to a metallic regime. Our results demonstrate the absence of
localization in a bulk system.

<p>The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a physical phenomenon where the vector potential
induces a phase shift of electron wavepackets in regions with zero magnetic
fields. It is often referred to as evidence for the physical reality of the
vector potential. A similar effect can be observed in solid-state systems,
where the Berry connection can influence electron dynamics. Here, we show that
in chiral-symmetric processes the Berry connection determines an observable
effect on the mean chiral displacement of delocalized wavefunctions. This
finding is supported by a photonic experiment realizing a topological quantum
walk, and demonstrates a new effect that can be attributed directly to the
presence of a gauge field.

<p>Amorphous titanium dioxide TiO2 (a-TiO2) has been widely studied,
particularly as a protective coating layer on semiconductors to prevent
corrosion and promote electron-hole conduction in photoelectrochemical
reactions. The stability and longevity of a-TiO2 is strongly affected by the
thickness and structural heterogeneity, implying that understanding the
structure properties of a-TiO2 is crucial for improving the performance. This
study characterized the structural and electronic properties of a-TiO2 thin
films (~17nm) grown on Si by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Fluctuation spectra
V(k) and angular correlation functions were determined with 4-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), which revealed the
distinctive medium-range ordering in the a-TiO2 film. A realistic atomic model
of a-TiO2 was established guided by the medium-range ordering and the
previously reported short-range ordering of a-TiO2 film, as well as the
interatomic potential. The structure was optimized by the StructOpt code using
a genetic algorithm that simultaneously minimizes energy and maximizes match to
experimental short- and medium-range ordering. The StructOpt a-TiO2 model
presents an improved agreements with the medium-range ordering and the k-space
location of the dominant 2-fold angular correlations compared with a
traditional melt-quenched model. The electronic structure of the StructOpt
a-TiO2 model was studied by ab initio calculation and compared to the
crystalline phases and experimental results. This work uncovered the
medium-range ordering in a-TiO2 thin film and provided a realistic a-TiO2
structure model for further investigation of structure-property relationships
and materials design. In addition, the improved multi-objective optimization
package StructOpt was provided for structure determination of complex materials

<h3>Oxygen tilt-driven polar super-orders in BiFeO3-based superlattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Ran Xu, Francesco Delodovici, Brahim Dkhil, Charles Paillard</i>
<p>Ferroelectric-dielectric superlattices have attracted renewed interest for
their ability to frustrate the polar order, leading to the emergence of exotic
polar textures. The electrostatic depolarization, thought to be responsible for
the complex polar textures in these superlattices can be alleviated by
replacing the dielectric layer with a metallic one. One would thus expect that
a close to uniform polarization state be recovered in the ferroelectric layer.
However, here we show, using Density Functional Theory calculations, that
antipolar motions may still appear in superlattices combining multiferroic
BiFeO3 and metallic SrRuO3 perovskite layers. We find that a complex oxygen
octahedra tilt order, a so-called nanotwin phase, exists in BiFeO3/SrRuO3
superlattices and competes with a more conventional phase. It leads to a
doubling of the chemical period along the out-of-plane direction, owing to the
presence of an oxygen octahedra tilt wave pattern and antipolar motions caused
by trilinear energy couplings. We also show that out-of-plane polar
displacements in the BiFeO3 layer may reverse the (anti)polar displacements
thanks to a strong quadrilinear coupling term. The oxygen tilt-driven couplings
identified here reveal new ways to engineer and control polar displacements in
superlattice based polar metals and hybrid improper (anti)ferroelectrics.

<i>P. L. Ebert, D. Gessert, W. Janke, M. Weigel</i>
<p>Population Monte Carlo simulations in the form commonly referred to as
population annealing can serve as a useful meta-algorithm for simulating
systems with complex free-energy landscapes. In the present paper we provide an
easily accessible introduction to the approach, focusing on spin systems as
simple example problems. While the method is very general and powerful, it also
comes with a number of tunable parameters. Here, we discuss the question of an
optimal choice of resampling protocol, that is shown to have significant
influence on the quality of results. While population annealing is an excellent
fit to the paradigm of massively parallel simulations, limitations in the
availability of parallel resources and especially memory can provide a
bottleneck to its efficacy. As we demonstrate for results of the Ising
ferromagnetic and spin-glass models, weighted averages of smaller-scale runs
can be easily combined to reduce both systematic and statistical errors in
order to avoid such bottlenecks.

<h3>Topologically protected photovoltaics in Bi nanoribbons</h3>

<br>
<i>Alejandro José Uría-Álvarez, Juan José Palacios</i>
<p>Photovoltaic efficiency in solar cells is hindered by many unwanted effects.
Radiative channels (emission of photons) sometimes mediated by non-radiative
ones (emission of phonons) are principally responsible for the decrease in
exciton population before charge separation can take place. Another unwanted
effect is electron-hole recombination at surfaces where in-gap edge states
serve as the non-radiative channels. Topological insulators (TIs), in
particular the most common ones characterized by a Z2 invariant, are rarely
explored from an optoelectronics standpoint, possibly because of their
typically small gaps. Otherwise, they are not much different from small-gap
semiconductors and excitons are also expected to be their simplest excitations.
Here we show that one can take advantage of the non-radiative decay channel due
to the surface states to generate a topologically protected photovoltaic
current. Focusing on two-dimensional TIs, and specifically for illustration
purposes on a Bi(111) monolayer, we show the potential of TI nanoribbons to
generate edge charge accumulation and edge currents under illumination.

<i>Umberto Marini Bettolo Marconi, Hartmut Löwen, Lorenzo Caprini</i>
<p>Non-equilibrium random fluctuations of non-thermal nature are a salient
feature of active matter. In this work, we consider the collective excitations
of active systems at high density, focusing on a one-dimensional chain of
elastically coupled inertial particles, whose activity is modeled with an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Their excitation spectrum shows the presence of two
kinds of fluctuations: the first ones are thermally excited phonons analogous
to those of a passive crystal while the second ones have been termed entropons
because associated with the entropy production due to the active forces. These
two types of fluctuations show different properties: in fact, only entropons
generate spatial velocity correlations and fail to satisfy a standard
fluctuation-response relation. We derive the exact expression for the
equal-time velocity and displacement correlations as well as for the structure
factor and in each case identify the phonon and entropon contributions.
Finally, we investigate the dynamical properties of the excitations in terms of
steady-state two-time correlations, such as the intermediate scattering
function and the mean-square displacement, and show that both phonon and
entropon fluctuations are characterized by a long wavelength overdamped regime
and a short wavelength underdamped regime. In the large persistence case,
entropons decay slower than phonons, and in general, activity tends to suppress
the oscillations typical of the underdamped regime.

<p>Bulk Rashba semiconductors, in which the combination of polar symmetry and
strong spin-orbit interactions leads to useful couplings between charge, spin,
and polarized light, are desired for new information processing and sensing
device concepts. We describe two unstudied phases of the 3D perovskite,
CsSnBr$_3$, which emerge below 85 K due to the formation of Sn(II) lone pairs
and their interaction with extant octahedral tilts. Phase II (77 K $<T<$ 85 K,
space group $P2_1/m$) exhibits ferroaxial order driven by a noncollinear
pattern of lone pair-driven distortions within the plane normal to the unique
octahedral tilt axis, preserving the inversion symmetry observed at higher
temperatures. Phase I ($T<$ 77 K, space group $P2_1$) additionally exhibits
ferroelectric order due to distortions along the unique tilt axis, breaking
both inversion and mirror symmetries. This polar and chiral phase exhibits
second harmonic generation from the bulk and a large, intrinsic
polarization-electrostriction coefficient along the polar axis
($Q_{22}\approx1.6$ m$^4$ C$^{-2}$), resulting in acute negative thermal
expansion ($\alpha_V=-9\times10^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$) through the onset of
spontaneous polarization. The unprecedented structures of phases I and II were
predicted by recursively following harmonic phonon instabilities to generate a
tree of candidate structures ("first-principles phonon mode mapping") and
subsequently corroborated by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and polarized
Raman and $^{81}$Br nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopies. Phase I
appears to exhibit the most complex structure reported for a commensurately
modulated (single) perovskite, as measured by the index of the space group in
that of the cubic aristotype (192). Relativistic electronic structure scenarios
compatible with the crystal structure of phase I and with reported

<p>Calculating magnetic properties of two-dimensional materials is crucial for
implementing memory devices (like USB drive, RAM, hard disk drive of computers)
having reduced size. Two dimensional materials can be implemented as a thin
film which can reduce the size of memory devices. These materials as well as
devices made with magnetic two-dimensional materials are of current research
interest in industry and academia. From the materials project database, crystal
structure file of 30 two dimensional materials have been downloaded to
calculate their magnetic properties. BURAI Quantum espresso software has been
used to extract magnetic properties of 30 two dimensional (2D) materials. These
30 materials have magnetic Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, and Cr atoms in their molecular
structure. Magnetic materials play a key and vital role in today's modern-day
technology. There are five different types of magnetic materials. The
classification magnetic materials are diamagnetism, paramagnetic,
ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, and anti-ferromagnetism. Total energy of
different magnetic configurations has been calculated to find the most stable
magnetic configurations of these materials.

<i>Md Rakibul Karim Akanda</i>
<p>Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) which is made of two
parallel Josephson junctions has applications in magnetometry. A similar
spin-based device is proposed here where spin superfluid in ferromagnet (FM)
mimics the superconducting state. Two materials CoFeB and Fe3Sn are used for
spin superfluid-based SQUID like device where easy plane anisotropy in CoFeB
can be engineered and Fe3Sn has inherent easy plane anisotropy. Frequency
varies in spin based proposed devices. Frequency increases and again decreases
with the increase in both applied magnetic field and applied spin current. The
proposed device can be used as nano oscillator and detector. The frequency in
the proposed device shows multiple frequency steps which can be used for

<i>Arun Kumar, Soumendra Nath Panja, Lukas Keller, Sunil Nair</i>
<p>We report on the CrFeTi$_2$O$_7$ (CFTO) system using a combination of x-ray
diffraction, dc magnetization, ac susceptibility, specific heat and neutron
diffraction measurements. CFTO is seen to crystallize in a monoclinic $P21/a$
symmetry. It shows a glassy freezing at $T{_f}$ ~ 22 K, characterized by the
observation of bifurcation between ZFC and FC ${\chi}$ (T) curves, frequency
dispersion across $T{_f}$ in ac susceptibility, appearance of non-zero remanent
magnetization and coercivity below $T{_f}$, very slow relaxation of iso-thermal
remanent magnetization with time and a linear temperature dependence of
magnetic contribution to specific heat $C{_m}$ below $T{_f}$. The microscopic
neutron diffraction analysis of CFTO not only confirms the absence of
long-range antiferromagnetic ordering but also exhibits diffuse scattering due
to the presence of shortrange ordered antiferromagnetically correlated spin
clusters.

<h3>Operator Spreading and Many-Body Localization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031</a>
<br>
<i>A. Weisse, R. Gerstner, J. Sirker</i>
<p>We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in Euclidean time in
one-dimensional many-body systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the
$k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive general bounds for the
operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting fermionic systems with
and without disorder. We show, in particular, that in a localized system the
norm does grow at most exponentially and that the contributions of operators to
the total norm are exponentially suppressed with their length. We support our
general results by considering one specific example, the XXZ chain with random
magnetic fields. We solve the operator spreading in the XX case without
disorder exactly. For the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models we provide strict
upper bounds. We support our results by symbolic calculations of the commutator
up to high orders. For the XXX case with random magnetic fields, these symbolic
calculations show a growth of the operator norm faster than exponential and
consistent with the general bound for a non-localized system. Also, there is no
exponential decay of the contribution of operators as function of their length.
We conclude that there is no indication for a many-body localization
transition. Finally, we also discuss the differences between the interacting
and non-interacting cases when trying to transform the microscopic to an
effective Hamiltonian of local conserved charges by consecutive
Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. We find that such an approach is not
well-defined in the interacting case because the transformation generates $\sim
4^\ell$ terms connecting sites a distance $\ell$ apart which can overwhelm the
exponential decay with $\ell$ of the amplitude of each individual term.

<h3>Structure-based out-of-distribution (OOD) materials property prediction:  a benchmark study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08032" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08032</a>
<br>
<i>Sadman Sadeed Omee, Nihang Fu, Rongzhi Dong, Ming Hu, Jianjun Hu</i>
<p>In real-world material research, machine learning (ML) models are usually
expected to predict and discover novel exceptional materials that deviate from
the known materials. It is thus a pressing question to provide an objective
evaluation of ML model performances in property prediction of
out-of-distribution (OOD) materials that are different from the training set
distribution. Traditional performance evaluation of materials property
prediction models through random splitting of the dataset frequently results in
artificially high performance assessments due to the inherent redundancy of
typical material datasets. Here we present a comprehensive benchmark study of
structure-based graph neural networks (GNNs) for extrapolative OOD materials
property prediction. We formulate five different categories of OOD ML problems
for three benchmark datasets from the MatBench study. Our extensive experiments
show that current state-of-the-art GNN algorithms significantly underperform
for the OOD property prediction tasks on average compared to their baselines in
the MatBench study, demonstrating a crucial generalization gap in realistic
material prediction tasks. We further examine the latent physical spaces of
these GNN models and identify the sources of CGCNN, ALIGNN, and DeeperGATGNN's
significantly more robust OOD performance than those of the current best models
in the MatBench study (coGN and coNGN), and provide insights to improve their
performance.

<p>Disorder at the etched edges of graphene quantum dots (GQD) enables random
all-to-all interactions between localized charges in partially-filled Landau

electrical conductance and thermoelectric power across the GQD. We observe a
rapid diminishing of electric conductance fluctuations and slowly decreasing
thermoelectric power across the GQD with increasing temperature, consistent
with recent theoretical predictions for the SYK regime.

<h3>Mass inversion at the Lifshitz transition in monolayer graphene by  diffusive, high-density, on-chip, doping</h3>

<br>
<i>Ayse Melis Aygar, Oliver Durnan, Bahar Molavi, Sam N. R. Bovey, Alexander Grüneis, Thomas Szkopek</i>
<p>Experimental setups for charge transport measurements are typically not
compatible with the ultra-high vacuum conditions for chemical doping, limiting
the charge carrier density that can be investigated by transport methods.
Field-effect methods, including dielectric gating and ionic liquid gating,
achieve too low a carrier density to induce electronic phase transitions. To
bridge this gap, we developed an integrated flip-chip method to dope graphene
by alkali vapour in the diffusive regime, suitable for charge transport
measurements at ultra-high charge carrier density. We introduce a cesium
droplet into a sealed cavity filled with inert gas to dope a monolayer graphene
sample by the process of cesium atom diffusion, adsorption and ionization at
the graphene surface, with doping beyond an electron density of
$4.7\times10^{14}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ monitored by operando Hall measurement. The
sealed assembly is stable against oxidation, enabling measurement of charge
transport versus temperature and magnetic field. Cyclotron mass inversion is
observed via the Hall effect, indicative of the change of Fermi surface
geometry associated with the Liftshitz transition at the hyperbolic $M$ point
of monolayer graphene. The transparent quartz substrate also functions as an
optical window, enabling non-resonant Raman scattering. Our findings show that
chemical doping, hitherto restricted to ultra-high vacuum, can be applied in a
diffusive regime at ambient pressure in an inert gas environment and thus
enable charge transport studies in standard cryogenic environments

<h3>Higher-order topological phases in bilayer phononic crystals and  topological bound states in the continuum</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiao-Yu Liu, Yang Liu, Zhan Xiong, Hai-Xiao Wang, Jian-Hua Jiang</i>
<p>Recent studies on the interplay between band topology and layer degree of
freedom provide an effective way to realize exotic topological phases. Here we
systematically study the $C_6$- and $C_3$-symmetric higher-order topological
phases in bilayer spinless tight-binding lattice models. For concreteness, we
consider bilayer phononic crystals as the realizations of these models. We find
that for mirror-symmetric-stacking bilayer lattices, the interlayer couplings
control the emergence and disappearance of the topological bound states in the
continuum where we consider the corner states as possible bound states in the
bulk continuum. For the bilayer phononic crystals formed by two different
lattices with identical symmetry, the band topology is determined by both the
band topology of each layer as well as their mutual couplings. The bilayer
phononic crystals experience a phase transition from nontrivial to trivial band
topology when the interlayer couplings are gradually increased. Our work
unveils the rich physics and topological phases emerging in bilayer lattice
systems that can be used to engineer interesting phenomena and induce emergent
topological phases.

<h3>Influence of temperature, doping, and amorphization on the electronic  structure and magnetic damping of iron</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08076</a>
<br>
<i>Zhihao Jiang, Axel Hoffmann, André Schleife</i>
<p>Hybrid magnonic quantum systems have drawn increased attention in recent
years for coherent quantum information processing, but too large magnetic
damping is a persistent concern when metallic magnets are used. Their intrinsic
damping is largely determined by electron-magnon scattering induced by
spin-orbit interactions. In the low scattering limit, damping is dominated by
intra-band electronic transitions, which has been theoretically shown to be
proportional to the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. In this
work, we focus on body-centered-cubic iron as a paradigmatic ferromagnetic
material. We comprehensively study its electronic structure using
first-principles density functional theory simulations and account for finite
lattice temperature, boron (B) doping, and structure amorphization. Our results
indicate that temperature induced atomic disorder and amorphous atomic
geometries only have a minor influence. Instead, boron doping noticeably
decreases the density of states near the Fermi level with an optimal doping
level of 6.25%. In addition, we show that this reduction varies significantly
for different atomic geometries and report that the highest reduction
correlates with a large magnetization of the material. This may suggest
materials growth under external magnetic fields as a route to explore in
experiment.

<h3>Entropy-Induced Phase Transitions in a Hidden Potts Model</h3>

<br>
<i>Cook Hyun Kim, D.-S. Lee, B. Kahng</i>
<p>A hidden state in which a spin does not interact with any other spin
contributes to the entropy of an interacting spin system. Using the
Ginzburg-Landau formalism in the mean-field limit, we explore the $q$-state
Potts model with extra $r$ hidden states. We analytically demonstrate that when
$1 < q \le 2$, the model exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising a variety of
phase transitions such as continuous, discontinuous, two types of hybrids, and
two consecutive second- and first-order transitions; moreover, several
characteristics such as critical, critical endpoint, and tricritical point are
identified. The critical line and critical end lines merge in a singular form
at the tricritical point. Those complex critical behaviors are not wholly
detected in previous research because the research is implemented only
numerically. We microscopically investigate the origin of the discontinuous
transition; it is induced by the competition between the interaction and
entropy of the system in the Ising limit, whereas by the bi-stability of the
hidden spin states in the percolation limit. Finally, we discuss the potential
applications of the hidden Potts model to social opinion formation with shy
voters and the percolation in interdependent networks.

<h3>Generalized Dynamical Keldysh Model</h3>

<i>E.Z. Kuchinskii, M.V.Sadovskii</i>
<p>We consider a certain class of exactly solvable models, describing spectral
properties an electron moving in random in time external field with different
statistical characteristics. This electron can be band - like or belong to a
quantum well. The known dynamical Keldysh model is generalized for the case of
fields with finite correlation time of fluctuations and for finite transfer
frequencies of these fluctuations. In all cases we are able to perform the
complete summation of all Feynman diagrams of corresponding perturbation series
for the Green's function. This can be done either by the reduction of this
series to some continuous fraction or by the use of the generalized Ward
identity from which we can derive recurrence relations for the Green's
function. In the case of a random field with finite transferred frequency there
appear the interesting effects of modulation of spectral density and density of
states.

<i>Chengkun Xing, Shu Zhang, Weiliang Yao, Dapeng Cui, Qing Huang, Junyi Yang, Shashi Pandey, Dongliang Gong, Lukas Horák, Yan Xin, Eun Sang Choi, Yang Zhang, Haidong Zhou, Jian Liu</i>
<p>Fluctuations of quantum spins play a crucial role in the emergence of exotic
magnetic phases and excitations. The lack of the charge degree of freedom in
insulating quantum magnets, however, precludes such fluctuations from mediating
electronic transport. Here we show that the quantum fluctuations of a localized
frustrated magnet induce strong proximitized charge transport of the conduction
electrons in a synthetic heterostructure comprising an epitaxial
$\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ ultrathin film on the single crystal of
$\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$. The proximity effects are evidenced by the scaling
behavior of the $\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ resistance in correspondance with the
dynamic scaling of the dynamic spin correlation function of
$\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$, which is a result of quantum fluctuations near a
multi-phase quantum critical point. The proximitized transport in
$\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ can be effectively tuned by magnetic field through
suppressing the quantum spin fluctuations as well as inducing transitions via
magnetic anisotropy in $\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$. Our work establishes a new
pathway for harnessing quantum spin fluctuations in magnetic insulators with
electric transport, offering exciting prospects for potential applications in
the realm of quantum spintronics.

<i>Parbati Senapati, Prakash Parida</i>
<p>Within the Coulomb blockade regime, our study delves into the charge, spin,
and thermoelectric transport characteristics in a benzene-based molecular
nano-junction using the Pauli master equation and linear response theory. The
charge- and spin-transport studies show strong negative differential
conductance features in the current-voltage ($I-V$) characteristics for the
ortho and meta connections of electrodes on either side. Contrarily, the
para-connection displays Coulomb staircase behavior. Exploring spin current
behavior in the presence of spin-polarized electrodes or external Zeeman field,
we establish a methodology that facilitates precise control over the specific
spin flow. Various charge and spin thermoelectric transport coefficients have
been studied with varying chemical potentials. We focus on
spin-polarized-conductance, the Seebeck coefficient, and the figure of merit.
By adjusting electrode polarization or employing an external magnetic field, we
achieve an impressive peak value for the spin thermoelectric figure of merit,
approximately 4.10. This outcome underscores the strategic value of harnessing
both spin-polarized electrodes and external magnetic fields within the domain
of spin caloritronics.

<i>Ranjeev Kumar Parashar, Priyajit Jash, Michael Zharnikov, Prakash Chandra Mondal</i>
<p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline,
nano-porous materials made of metal-ion-based nodes and organic linkers. Most
of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural
diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation
applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding
and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of
MOFs reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics,
optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the
MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic
applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and
surface-anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition
metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing
tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for
MOFs-based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and
underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review
highlights the pros and cons of MOFs-based electronics, followed by an analysis
of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF
compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and
further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and
result in improved devices performance.

<br>
<i>Srimayi Korrapati, Snehasish Nandy, Sumanta Tewari</i>
<p>Recent theoretical work has shown that higher-order moments of the Berry
curvature, e.g., Berry curvature quadrupole or hexapole moments can produce the
leading order nonlinear anomalous Hall response (NLAH) in systems with special
magnetic point group symmetry. Recent experimental work has reported the
observation of the Berry curvature quadrupole-induced third-order NLAH (i.e.,
Hall voltage proportional to the third power of the external electric field)
from cryogenic conditions to room temperature in an epitaxially grown material
platform with broken time-reversal symmetry. In this paper, using semiclassical
Boltzmann formalism in the relaxation time approximation, we compute the Berry
curvature quadrupole-induced nonlinear anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst
coefficients in time-reversal broken systems. In systems where Berry curvature
monopole and dipole moments vanish by symmetry, our results predict the
behavior of the leading order transverse anomalous thermoelectric coefficients
proportional to the third power of the applied longitudinal temperature
gradient, and are guaranteed to exist in systems that have already exhibited
the third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in recent experiments.

<br>
<i>Manas Ranjan Mahapatra, Rakesh Kumar</i>
<p>Finding an exact solution for interacting quantum many-body systems is a
non-trivial task. There are only a few problems where we know the exact
solution, often in a narrow parameter space. We propose a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg
model with a \emph{unique} and \emph{exact} dimer ground state at
$J_2/J_1=1/2$. A dimer state is a product of spin-singlets on dimers (some
distinct bonds). We investigate the model employing bond-operator mean-field
theory and exact numerical diagonalization. These tools correctly verify the
exactness of the dimer ground state at the exact point ($J_2/J_1=1/2$). As we
move away from the exact point, the dimer order melts and vanishes, where the
spin-gap becomes zero. The mean-field theory with harmonic approximation
indicates that the dimer order remains for $-0.35\lesssim J_2/J_1\lesssim
1.35$. In non-harmonic approximation, the upper critical point lowers by $0.28$
to $1.07$, whereas the lower critical point remains intact. The model gives
N\'eel order as we move below the lower critical point and stripe magnetic
order above the upper critical point.

<p>An investigation of the thermodynamic and electrical transport properties of
the isoelectronic chemical substitution series CeTi$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$Ge$_{3}$
(CTVG) single crystals is reported. As x increases, the ferromagnetic (FM)
transition temperature is suppressed, reaching absolute zero at the critical
concentration x = 0.4, where a non-Fermi-liquid low-temperature specific heat
and electrical resistivity, as well as the hyperscaling of specific heat and
magnetization are found. Our study clearly identifies an FM quantum critical
point (QCP) in CTVG. The obtained critical exponents suggest that CTVG falls in
the preasymptotic region of the disorder-tuned FM QCP predicted by the
Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta theory.

<p>Electron-ion interactions play a central role for the energy relaxation
processes and ultra-fast structure dynamics in laser-heated matter. The
accurate prediction of the electron-ion energy exchange in a transient excited
two-temperature situation still remains an open and challenging problem even
though various theoretical efforts have been made. Here, following our recent
work [Zhang et al., Materials 15, 1902 (2022)], we take an approach combining
finite temperature DFT-MD and corresponding density functional perturbation
theory to evaluate the electron-ion coupling factors in the warm dense regime.
The use of density-temperature-dependent Eliashberg functions and electron
density of states are highlighted. Good agreement of our DFT based results can
be observed with recent data by Simoni et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 205001
(2019)]. For a proof of concept, we use our newly obtained energy transfer
rates to discuss temperature equilibration in warm dense aluminum.

<i>Zhishuo Huang, Naoya Iwahara, Liviu F. Chibotaru</i>
<p>Jahn-Teller (JT) systems with strong and intermediate vibronic coupling are
described in terms of local JT active vibrational modes. In JT crystals, the
elastic interaction of these modes at different JT centers plays a crucial
role, for instance, in determining critical temperature of structural phase
transitions. Despite their importance, the parameters of elastic interaction
between JT centers have not been accessed yet by first-principles calculations.
In this paper, we develop an effective Hamiltonian methodology for the thorough
description of the elastic interactions in cooperative Jahn-Teller problems,
which treats the interactions with both phonons and uniform strains. All the
microscopic parameters, such as lattice Green's functions, elastic modulus, can
be obtained or calculated based on first-principles the calculation. The method
has been applied to a series of 5d1 double perovskites. Such effective
Hamiltonian methodology can be, in general, used to investigate the APES of any
type of the local distortions, such as impurities, defects, etc.

<p>Spin wave propagation along a ferrimagnetic strip with out-of-plane
magnetization is studied by means of micromagnetic simulations. The
ferrimagnetic material is considered as formed by two antiferromagnetically
coupled sublattices. Two critical temperatures can be defined for such systems:
that of magnetization compensation and that of angular momentum compensation,
both different due to distinct Land\'e factors for each sub-lattice. Spin waves
in the strip are excited by a spin current injected at one of its edges. The
obtained dispersion diagrams show exchange-dominated forward volume spin waves.
For a given excitation frequency, N\'eel vector describes highly eccentric

<p>We study the fluorescence of nanodiamond ensembles as a function of static
external magnetic field and observe characteristic dip features close to the
zero field with potential for magnetometry applications. We analyze the
dependence of the features width and contrast of the feature on the size of the
diamond (in the range 30 nm to 3 um) and on the strength of a bias magnetic
field applied transversely to the field being scanned. We also perform
optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements to quantify the
strain splitting of the zero-field ODMR resonance across various nanodiamond
sizes and compare it with the width and contrast measurements of the zero-field
fluorescence features for both nanodiamonds and bulk samples. The observed
properties provide compelling evidence of cross-relaxation effects in the NV
system occurring close to zero magnetic fields. Finally, the potential of this
technique for use in practical magnetometry is discussed.

<p>Harmonic generation provides an efficient tool for the study of ultrafast
nonlinear dynamics. We report on time-resolved optical-pump
terahertz-harmonic-generation spectroscopic investigation of ultrafast
nonlinearity in a prototypical three-dimensional Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$.
A transient population inversion characterized by excessive nonthermal Dirac
electrons and holes is found to be very sensitive and responsive to a periodic
terahertz drive, leading to very efficient terahertz third-harmonic generation.
Based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we analyze the terahertz field-driven
kinetics of the transient Dirac fermions that is responsible for the observed

<p>Flat bands in Moir\'e systems are exciting new playgrounds for the generation
and study of exotic many-body physics phenomena in low-dimensional materials.
Such physics is attributed to the vanishing kinetic energy and strong spatial
localization of the flat-band states. Here we use numerical simulations to
examine the electronic transport properties of such flat bands in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder. We find that while a
conventional downscaling of the mean free path with increasing disorder
strength occurs at higher energies, in the flat bands the mean free path
actually increases with increasing disorder strength. This disorder-induced
delocalization suggests that weak disorder may have a strong impact on the
exotic physics of magic-angle bilayer graphene and other flat band systems.

<p>We report on the effects of 3.5 MeV proton irradiation in
RbCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with unusual properties
in between those of the pnictides and of the cuprate high-temperature
superconductors. We studied how structural disorder introduced by ion
bombardment affects the critical temperature, superfluid density and gap values
by combining a coplanar waveguide resonator technique, electric transport
measurements and point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy. We find an
unusually weak dependence of the superconducting properties on the amount of
disorder in this material when compared to other iron-based superconductors
under comparable irradiation conditions. The nodal multigap state exhibited by
pristine RbCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ is also robust against proton irradiation,
with a two-band $d-d$ model being the one that best fits the experimental data.

<p>The doped Hubbard model is one of the paradigmatic platforms to engineer
exotic quantum many-body states, including charge-ordered states, strange
metals and unconventional superconductors. While undoped and doped correlated
phases have been experimentally realized in a variety twisted van der Waals
materials, experiments in monolayer materials, and in particular 1T transition
metal dichalcogenides, have solely reached the conventional insulating undoped
regime. Correlated phases in monolayer two-dimensional materials have much
higher associated energy scales than their twisted counterparts, making doped
correlated monolayers an attractive platform for high temperature correlated
quantum matter. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a doped Mott phase in a
van der Waals dichalcogenide 1T-NbSe$_2$ monolayer. The system is electron
doped due to electron transfer to a monolayer van der Waals substrate via
proximity, leading to a correlated triangular lattice with both half-filled and
fully-filled sites. We analyze the distribution of the half-filled and filled
sites and show the arrangement is unlikely to be controlled by disorder alone,
and we show that the presence of competing non-local many-body correlations
would account for the charge correlations found experimentally. Our results
establish 1T-NbSe$_2$ as a potential monolayer platform to explore correlated
doped Mott physics in a frustrated lattice.

<h3>Multifractality of Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</a>
<br>
<i>Shu Hamanaka, Kohei Kawabata</i>
<p>The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number
of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in
non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics.
However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to
be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as
multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not
accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the
many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin
effect can coexist with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to
multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates
the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the
Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes
a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a
fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum
many-body systems.

<h3>Controlled synthesis and characterization of porous silicon  nanoparticles for dynamic nuclear polarization</h3>

<p>Si nanoparticles (NPs) have been actively developed as a hyperpolarized
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agent with an imaging window of more than one
hour. However, the progress in the development of NPs has been hampered by the
incomplete understanding of their structural properties that correspond to
efficient hyperpolarization build up and long polarization decays. In this work
we study dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of single crystal porous Si (PSi)
NPs with defined doping densities ranging from nominally undoped to highly
doped with boron or phosphorus. To develop such PSi NPs we perform low-load
metal-assisted catalytic etching for electronic grade Si powder followed by
thermal oxidation to form the dangling bonds in the $\text{Si/SiO}_2$
interface, the $P_b$ centers, which are the endogenous source of the unpaired
electron spins necessary for DNP. The controlled fabrication and oxidation
procedures allow us to thoroughly investigate the impact of the magnetic field,
temperature and doping on the DNP process, as well as to identify the rate
limiting step for the polarization buildup and decay. We argue that the buildup
and decay rate constants are limited by the polarization transfer across the
nuclear spin diffusion barrier determined by the large hyperfine shift of the
central \textsuperscript{29}Si nuclei of the $P_b$ centers. Finally, we find
the room temperature relaxation of low boron doped PSi NPs reaching $75 \pm 3$
minutes and nuclear polarization levels exceeding $\sim 6$ % when polarized at
6.7 T and 1.4 K. Our study thus establishes solid grounds for further
development of Si NPs.

<h3>Symmetry-Driven Valleytronics in Single-Layer Tin Chalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08339</a>
<br>
<i>Vo Khuong Dien, Pham Thi Bich Thao, Nguyen Thi Han, Nguyen Thanh Tien</i>
<p>The concept of valleytronics has recently gained considerable research
attention due to its intriguing physical phenomena and practical applications
in optoelectronics and quantum information. In this study, by employing GW-BSE
calculations and symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that single-layer
orthorhombic SnS and SnSe possess high carrier mobility and exceptional
excitonic effects. Especially, these materials display spontaneous linearly
polarized optical selectivity, a behavior that differs from the
valley-selective circular dichroism observed in the hexagonal lattices.
Specifically, when subjected to a zigzag polarization of light, only the A
exciton (stemming from the X valley) becomes optically active, while the B
exciton (arising from the Y valley) remains dark. The armchair-polarized light
triggers the opposite behavior. This selective optical excitation arises from
the symmetry of the bands under mirror symmetry. Additionally, the study
reveals a strong coupling between valley physics and ferroelectricity in
layered tin chalcogenides, enabling the manipulation of electronic transport
and exciton polarization. Layered tin chalcogenides thus emerge as promising
candidates for both valleytronic and ferroelectric materials.

<h3>Stochastic 3D microstructure modeling of twinned polycrystals for  investigating the mechanical behavior of $γ$-TiAl intermetallics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08349" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08349</a>
<br>
<i>Philipp Rieder, Matthias Neumann, Lucas Monteiro Fernandes, Aude Mulard, Henry Proudhon, François Willot, Volker Schmidt</i>
<p>A stochastic 3D microstructure model for polycrystals is introduced which
incorporates two types of twin grains, namely neighboring and inclusion twins.
They mimic the presence of crystal twins in $\gamma$-TiAl polycrystalline
microstructures as observed by 3D imaging techniques. The polycrystal grain
morphology is modeled by means of Voronoi and -- more generally -- Laguerre
tessellations. The crystallographic orientation of each grain is either sampled
uniformly on the space of orientations or chosen to be in a twinning relation
with another grain. The model is used to quantitatively study relationships
between morphology and mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials. For
this purpose, full-field Fourier-based computations are performed to
investigate the combined effect of grain morphology and twinning on the overall
elastic response. For $\gamma$-TiAl polycrystallines, the presence of twins is
associated with a softer response compared to polycrystalline aggregates
without twins. However, when comparing the influence on the elastic response,
the presence of twin grains has a much smaller effect than a statistically
different polycrystalline morphology. Notably, the bulk modulus is almost
insensitive to the grain morphology and exhibits much less sensitivity to the
presence of twins compared to the shear modulus. The numerical results are
consistent with a two-scale homogenization estimate that utilizes laminate
materials to model the interactions of twins.

<h3>Active Control of Ballistic Orbital Transport</h3>

<br>
<i>Sobhan Subhra Mishra, James Lourembam, Dennis Jing Xiong Lin, Ranjan Singh</i>
<p>Orbital current, defined as the orbital character of Bloch states in solids,
can ballistically travel with larger coherence length through a broader range
of materials than its spin counterpart, facilitating a robust, higher density
and energy efficient information transmission. Hence, active control of orbital
transport plays a pivotal role in propelling the progress of the evolving field
of quantum information technology. Unlike spin angular momentum, orbital
angular momentum (OAM), couples to phonon angular momentum (PAM) efficiently
via orbital-crystal momentum (L-k) coupling, giving us the opportunity to
control orbital transport through crystal field potential mediated angular
momentum transfer. Here, leveraging the orbital dependant efficient L-k
coupling, we have experimentally demonstrated the active control of orbital
current velocity using THz emission spectroscopy. Our findings include the
identification of a critical energy density required to overcome collisions in
orbital transport, enabling a swifter flow of orbital current. The capability
to actively control the ballistic orbital transport lays the groundwork for the
development of ultrafast devices capable of efficiently transmitting
information over extended distance.

<h3>Thermoelectric power of overdoped Tl2201 crystals: Charge density waves  and $T^1$ and $T^2$ resistivities</h3>

<br>
<i>J. R. Cooper, J. C. Baglo, C. Putzke, A. Carrington</i>
<p>We report measurements of the in-plane thermoelectric power (TEP) for an
overdoped (OD) crystal of the single layer cuprate superconductor
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$ (Tl2201) at several hole concentrations ($p$), from 300
or 400 K to below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$). For $p$ =
0.192 and 0.220, small upturns in the TEP below 150 K are attributed to the
presence of charge density waves (CDW) detected by resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering studies. This suggests that measurement of the TEP could provide a
simple and effective guide to the presence of a CDW. Over a certain temperature
range, often strongly restricted by the CDW, the TEP is consistent with the
Nordheim-Gorter rule and the $T^1$ and $T^2$ terms in the in-plane resistivity
of similar crystals observed below 160 K. Two scenarios in which the $T^1$
scattering term is uniform or non-uniform around the Fermi surface are
discussed. As found previously by others, for uniform scattering the $T^1$
terms give scattering rates ($\tau^{-1}$) at lower $p$ that are somewhat larger
than the Planckian value $k_B T/\hbar$ and fall to zero for heavily OD
crystals. Near 160 K, $\tau^{-1}$ from the $T^2$ terms corresponds to the
Planckian value.

<h3>Loop current states and their stability in small fractal lattices of  Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>

<br>
<i>Georg Koch, Anna Posazhennikova</i>
<p>We consider a model of interacting Bose-Einstein condensates on small
Sierpinski gaskets. We study eigenstates which are characterised by cyclic
supercurrents per each triangular plaquette ("loop" states). For noninteracting
systems we find at least three classes of loop eigenmodes: standard; chaotic
and periodic. Standard modes are those inherited from the basic three-site ring
of condensates with phase differences locked to $2\pi/3$. Standard modes become
unstable in the interacting system but only when interaction exceeds a certain
critical value $u_c$. Chaotic modes are characterised by very different
circular currents per plaquette, so that the usual symmetry of loop currents is
broken. Circular supercurrents associated with chaotic modes become chaotic for
any finite interaction, signalling the loss of coherence between the
condensates. Periodic modes are described by alternating populations and two
different phase differences. The modes are self-similar and are present in all
generations of Sierpinskii gasket. When interaction is included, circular
current of such a mode becomes periodic in time with the amplitude growing
linearly with interaction. Above a critical interaction the amplitude saturates
signalling a transition to a macroscopic self-trapping state originally known
from a usual Bose Josephson junction. We perform a systematic analysis of this
novel and rich physics.

<br>
<i>Eisenmann Isabelle, L'Homme Alfredo, Lahlou Aliénor, Bujaldon Sandrine, Le Saux Thomas, Bailleul Benjamin, Desprat Nicolas, Jeanneret Raphaël</i>
<p>Light can be harmful for photosynthetic organisms when it exceeds the
capacity of photon conversion by the photosynthetic machinery. When light
intensity is too high, the motile micro-algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
reorients itself to swim away from the source. We recently discovered that a
suspension of photophobic algae can be unstable, occasioning a complete phase
separation of the system with the emergence of an active liquid phase. Indeed
here small spatial fluctuations in cell density influence the phototactic
behavior of surrounding cells which tend to join and therefore amplify the
fluctuations. In a cylindrical geometry, this strong coupling between cell
density and light fields through both negative phototaxis and light absorption
by the individual cells led to the emergence of dynamic branching patterns
whose features depend on the global cell density, light intensity and medium
viscosity. We developed a simple model based on a drift-diffusion framework
that finely reproduces the experimental data on the destabilization. We finally
showed that this active phase separation efficiently protects the individual
cells against the negative effects of light on the integrity of the
photosynthetic machinery (photoinhibition of Photosystem II), demonstrating
that on short timescales phototaxis efficiently contributes to photoprotection
through collective behaviors at the population level.

<p>Coupling of angular motion to a spin degree of freedom gives rise to various
transport phenomena in quantum systems that are beyond the standard paradigms
of classical physics. Here, we discuss features of spin-orbit dynamics that can
be visualized using a classical model with two coupled angular degrees of
freedom. Specifically, we demonstrate classical 'spin' filtering through our
model and show that the interplay between angular degrees of freedom and
dissipation can lead to asymmetric 'spin' transport.

<p>In the current paper, we report the results of surface modification of cubic
Y2O3 films employing carbon-ion implantation. The characterization results
demonstrate the formation of a stable yttrium oxalate-based structure with
cavities filled with carbon clusters. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that
the incorporation of eighteen-atom carbon clusters into the cavities of
Y2(C2O4)3 does not lead to valuable changes in the crystal structure of yttrium
oxalate. X-ray diffraction and optical measurements demonstrate that the
subsurface bulk area of cubic yttrium oxide remains unperturbed. The oxalate
"skin" thickness with embedded carbon clusters is estimated to be approximately
10 nm. The prospective employing the method to manage optical properties and
increase the biocompatibility of yttria and lanthanide oxides are discussed.

<h3>Multiple-mode Quantum-anomalous-Hall and Chern-switchable States in  Germanene (Stanene, Silicene)/MBi2Te4 Heterostructures</h3>

<i>Zhe Li, Jiatong Zhang, Xiyu Hong, Xiao Feng, Yong Xu, Ke He</i>
<p>By constructing germanene (stanene, silicene)/MBi2Te4 (M = 3d-transition
elements) heterostructures, we've discovered and designed multiple-mode
quantum-anomalous-Hall (mQAH) and Chern-switchable states with global gaps via
first-principle computations. Conventional QAH and valley-polarized QAH states
with opposite chirality can coexist and interact at both the \Gamma point of
MBi2Te4 and the K(K') points of germanene (stanene, silicene) respectively,
which are triggered by only the M atoms. Adjusting magnetic configurations of
MBi2Te4-layers can not only switch on (off) the QAH conductance, but also
switch Chern numbers exactly. For example, germanene/bilayer-NiBi2Te4 cherishes
the Chern-number: C=+1 in ferromagnetic couplings and C=+2 in antiferromagnetic
couplings. Experimentally-available stacking-order-shifts can also step-likely
switch Chern numbers and chirality in most of heterostructures. This work not
only establishes one-magnetic-source, mQAH insulators for the first time, but
also triggers a global-gapped, experimentally available method for
Chern-switchable spintronics and valleytronics.

<br>
<i>Luca Cocconi, Letian Chen</i>
<p>The Szilard engine stands as a compelling illustration of the intricate
interplay between information and thermodynamics. While at thermodynamic
equilibrium, the apparent breach of the second law of thermodynamics was
reconciled by Landauer and Bennett's insights into memory writing and erasure,
recent extensions of these concepts into regimes featuring active fluctuations
have unveiled the prospect of exceeding Landauer's bound, capitalizing on
information to divert free energy from dissipation towards useful work. To
explore this question further, we investigate an autonomous dynamic Szilard
engine, addressing the thermodynamic consistency of work extraction and
measurement costs by extending the phase space to incorporate an auxiliary
system, which plays the role of an explicit measurement device. The
nonreciprocal coupling between active particle and measurement device
introduces a feedback control loop, and the cost of measurement is quantified
through excess entropy production. The study considers different measurement
scenarios, highlighting the role of measurement precision in determining engine
efficiency.

<p>The finite temperature version of the Vashishta-Singwi (VS) dielectric scheme
for the paramagnetic warm dense uniform electron fluid is revisited correcting
for an earlier thermodynamic derivative error. The VS scheme handles quantum
mechanical effects at the level of the random phase approximation and treats
correlations via the density expansion of a generalized
Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"olander (STLS) closure that inserts a parameter determined
by enforcing the compressibility sum rule. Systematic comparison with
quasi-exact results, based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations, reveals a
structural superiority of the VS scheme towards strong coupling and a
thermodynamic superiority of the STLS scheme courtesy of a favorable
cancellation of errors. Guidelines are provided for the construction of
dielectric schemes that are expected to be more accurate but computationally
costly.

<p>Correlated electron systems may give rise to multiple effective interactions
whose combined impact on quasiparticle properties can be difficult to
disentangle. We introduce an unambiguous decomposition of the electronic
self-energy which allows us to quantify the contributions of various effective
interactions simultaneously. We use this tool to revisit the hole-doped Hubbard
model within the dynamical cluster approximation, where commonly spin
fluctuations are considered to be the origin of the pseudogap. While our
fluctuation decomposition confirms that spin fluctuations indeed suppress
antinodal electronic spectral weight, we show that they alone can not capture
the pseudogap self-energy quantitatively. Nonlocal multi-boson Feynman diagrams
yield substantial contributions and are needed for a quantitative description
of the pseudogap.

<h3>Showcasing the necessity of the principle of relative motion in physical  statistics: Inconsistency of the `segmented Fermi surface'</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08576" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08576</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Ku, Anthony Hegg</i>
<p>The hunt for exotic properties in flowing systems is a popular and active
field of study, and has recently gained renewed attention through claims such
as a ``segmented Fermi surface'' in a superconducting system that hosts steady
superflow of screening current driven by an external field. Apart from this
excitement and the promise of hosting Majorana zero modes, claims such as this
imply exotic gap-to-gapless quantum phase transitions merely through boost of
inertial frames of observation, and challenge the very concept behind the
principle of relative motion. Here, we first illustrate an obvious inescapable
physical inconsistency of such claims concerning the flow velocity. Taking into
account this basic principle from the beginning, we then demonstrate that a
proper employment of physical statistics naturally reproduces the experimental
observation without causing such a conceptual crisis. This example showcases
the importance of strict adherence to the basic principle of relative motion in
physical statistics, especially when pushing the frontiers of physics and
technology.
