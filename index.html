<h3>Spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ Quantum Link Models with Dynamical Matter on a  Quantum Simulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06368</a>

<br>
Quantum link models (QLMs) offer the realistic prospect for the practical
implementation of lattice quantum electrodynamics (QED) on modern quantum
simulators, and they provide a venue for exploring various nonergodic phenomena
relevant to quantum many-body physics. In these models, gauge and electric
fields are represented by spin-$S$ operators. So far, large-scale realizations
of QLMs have been restricted to $S=1/2$ representations, whereas the
lattice-QED limit is approached at $S\to\infty$. Here, we present a bosonic
mapping for the representation of gauge and electric fields with effective
spin-$S$ operators for arbitrarily large values of $S$. Based on this mapping,
we then propose an experimental scheme for the realization of a large-scale
spin-$1$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ QLM using spinless bosons in an optical superlattice.
Using perturbation theory and infinite matrix product state calculations, which
work directly in the thermodynamic limit, we demonstrate the faithfulness of
the mapping and stability of gauge invariance throughout all accessible
evolution times. We further demonstrate the potential of our proposed quantum
simulator to address relevant high-energy physics by probing the
(de)confinement of an electron--positron pair by tuning the gauge coupling. Our
work provides an essential step towards gauge-theory quantum simulators in the
quantum-field-theory limit.

<h3>Spin exchange-enabled quantum simulator for large-scale non-Abelian  gauge theories</h3>

A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice
gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying
gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of
large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian
gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an
experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian
$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D,
enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent
gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D
$\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical matter and
induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current
ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide
numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and
demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We
develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the
relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our
approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale
non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.

<h3>The connection between Hilbert-space return probability and real-space  autocorrelations in quantum spin chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06374</a>

<br>
<br>
The dynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems has two seemingly
disparate but fundamental facets. The first is the dynamics of real-space local
observables, and if and how they thermalise. The second is to interpret the
dynamics of the many-body state as that of a fictitious particle on the
underlying Hilbert-space graph. In this work, we derive an explicit connection
between these two aspects of the dynamics. We show that the temporal decay of
the autocorrelation in a disordered quantum spin chain is explicitly encoded in
how the return probability on Hilbert space approaches its late-time
saturation. As such, the latter has the same functional form in time as the
decay of autocorrelations but with renormalised parameters. Our analytical
treatment is rooted in an understanding of the morphology of the time-evolving
state on the Hilbert-space graph, and corroborated by exact numerical results.

<h3>A fluctuation-dissipation relation in a non-equilibrium quantum fluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06406" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06406</a>
<br>
<i>T.R. Kirkpatrick, D. Belitz</i>
<br>
<br>
A major obstacle for studying systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium is the
absence of a simple fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We consider fluctuations
of the temperature and the shear velocity in a fermionic fluid in a
non-equilibrium steady state characterized by a constant temperature gradient.
We show that the commutator correlation functions are related to the bilinear
response of products of these observables to an external perturbation. This
allows for experimental probes of the long-range correlations that exist in
such a system, quantum or classical, via response experiments.

<h3>Thermal Drude weight in an integrable chiral clock model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06413</a>
<br>
<i>Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the finite temperature thermal conductivity of a time-reversal
invariant chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model along an integrable line in the
parameter space using tDMRG. The thermal current itself is not a conserved
charge, unlike in the XXZ model, but has a finite overlap with a local
conserved charge $Q^{(2)}$ obtained from the transfer matrix. We find that the
Drude weight is finite at non-zero temperature, and the Mazur bound from
$Q^{(2)}$ saturates the Drude weight, allowing us to obtain an asymptotic
expression for the Drude weight at high temperatures. The numerical estimates
are validated using a sum rule for thermal conductivity. On the computational
side, we also explore the effectiveness of the ancilla disentangler in the
integrable and non-integrable regimes of the model. We find that the
disentangler helps in localizing the entanglement growth around the quench
location, but the improvement is lesser in the non-integrable regime and at low
temperatures.

<h3>Strange metallicity in an antiferromagnetic quantum critical model: A  sign-problem-free quantum Monte-Carlo study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06421" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06421</a>
<br>
<i>Rafael M. P. Teixeira, Catherine Pépin, Hermann Freire</i>
<br>
<br>
We compute transport and thermodynamic properties of a two-band spin-fermion
model describing itinerant fermions in two dimensions interacting via $Z_2$
antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations by means of a sign-problem-free
quantum Monte-Carlo approach. We show that the phase diagram of this model
indeed contains a $d$-wave superconducting phase at low enough temperatures.
However, a crucial question that arises is whether a non-Fermi-liquid metallic
regime exists above $T_c$ exhibiting hallmark strange-metal transport
phenomenology. Interestingly, we find that this version of the model describes
a non-Fermi-liquid metallic regime that displays an approximately $T$-linear
resistivity above $T_c$ for a strong fermion-boson interaction. Using
Nernst-Einstein relation, our QMC results also show that this strange metal
phase exhibits a crossover from being characterized by a charge compressibility
given approximately by $\chi_{c}\sim 1/T$ at high temperatures to being
described by a charge diffusivity consistent with the scaling $D_{c}\sim 1/T$
at low temperatures. Therefore, our work adds support to the view that the
$Z_2$ antiferromagnetic spin-fermion model at strong coupling can be considered
a minimal model that describes both unconventional superconductivity and
strange metallicity, which are fundamentally interconnected in many important
strongly-correlated quantum materials.

<h3>Inverse projection of axisymmetric orientation distributions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06433</a>
<br>
<i>Philipp A. Kloza, James A. Elliott</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the projection of an axisymmetric three-dimensional orientation
distribution to two dimensions can be cast into an Abel transform. Based on
this correspondence, we derive an exact integral inverse, which allows for the
quantification of three-dimensional uniaxial alignment of rodlike units from
two-dimensional sliced images, thus providing an alternative to X-ray or
tomographic analysis. A matrix representation of the projection and its inverse
is derived, providing a direct relationship between two- and three-dimensional
order parameters for both polar and non-polar systems.

<h3>Phase transitions in the mini-batch size for sparse and dense neural  networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06435" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06435</a>
<br>
<i>Raffaele Marino, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</i>
<br>
<br>
The use of mini-batches of data in training artificial neural networks is
nowadays very common. Despite its broad usage, theories explaining
quantitatively how large or small the optimal mini-batch size should be are
missing. This work presents a systematic attempt at understanding the role of
the mini-batch size in training two-layer neural networks. Working in the
teacher-student scenario, with a sparse teacher, and focusing on tasks of
different complexity, we quantify the effects of changing the mini-batch size
$m$. We find that often the generalization performances of the student strongly
depend on $m$ and may undergo sharp phase transitions at a critical value
$m_c$, such that for $m<m_c$ the training process fails, while for $m>m_c$ the
student learns perfectly or generalizes very well the teacher. Phase
transitions are induced by collective phenomena firstly discovered in
statistical mechanics and later observed in many fields of science. Finding a
phase transition varying the mini-batch size raises several important questions
on the role of a hyperparameter which have been somehow overlooked until now.

<h3>Classical fully-packed loop model with attractive interactions on the  square lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06458" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06458</a>
<br>
<i>Bhupen Dabholkar, Xiaoxue Ran, Junchen Rong, Zheng Yan, G. J. Sreejith, Zi Yang Meng, Fabien Alet</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a classical model of fully-packed loops on the square lattice, which
interact through attractive loop segment interactions between opposite sides of
plaquettes. This study is motivated by effective models of interacting quantum
matter arising in frustrated magnets or Rydberg atom arrays, for which loop
degrees of freedom appear at low energy. Through a combination of Monte Carlo
simulations and an effective height field theory, we find that the critical
point known to occur at infinite temperature gives rise to a high-temperature
critical phase with floating exponents. At lower temperature, the system
transitions via a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition to a nematic phase where
lattice rotation symmetry is broken. We discuss consequences for the phase
diagram of the quantum loop model on the same lattice.

<h3>Intrinsically patterned two-dimensional transition metal halides</h3>

Patterning and defect engineering are key methods to tune 2D materials'
properties. However, generating 2D periodic patterns of point defects in 2D
materials has been elusive until now, despite the well-established methods for
creating isolated point defects and defect lines. Herein, we report on
intrinsically patterned 2D transition metal dihalides on metal surfaces
featuring periodic halogen vacancies that result in alternating coordination of
the transition metal atoms throughout the film. Using low-temperature scanning
probe microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we identified the
structural properties of patterned FeBr$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers grown
epitaxially on Au(111). Density-functional theory reveals that the Br-vacancies
are facilitated by low formation energies and accompanied by a lateral
softening of the layers leading to a significant reduction of the lattice
mismatch to the underlying Au(111). We demonstrate that interfacial epitaxial
strain engineering presents a versatile strategy for controlled patterning in
2D. In particular, patterning 2D magnets provides new pathways to create
unconventional spin textures with non-collinear spin.

<h3>Double-layer Kagome Metals Pt3Tl2 and Pt3In2</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The connectivity and inherent frustration of the kagome lattice can produce
interesting electronic structures and behaviors in compounds containing this
structural motif. Here we report the properties of Pt3X2 (X = In and Tl) that
adopt a double-layer kagome net structure related to that of the topologically
nontrivial high temperature ferromagnet Fe3Sn2 and the density wave hosting
compound V3Sb2. We examined the structural and physical properties of single
crystal Pt3Tl2 and polycrystalline Pt3In2 using x-ray and neutron diffraction,
magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and electrical transport measurements,
along with density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure.
Our calculations show that Fermi levels lie in pseudogaps in the densities of
states with several bands contributing to transport, and this is consistent
with our Hall effect, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements.
While electronic dispersions characteristic of simple kagome nets with
nearest-neighbor hopping are not clearly seen, likely due to the extended
nature of the Pt 5d states, we do observe moderately large and non-saturating
magnetoresistance values and quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance and
magnetization associated with the kagome nets of Pt.

<h3>Topological Nernst and topological thermal Hall effect in rare-earth  kagome ScMn$_6$Sn$_6$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Thermal and thermoelectric measurements are known as powerful tools to
uncover the physical properties of quantum materials due to their sensitivity
towards the scattering and chirality of heat carriers. We use these techniques
to confirm the presence of momentum and real-space topology in ScMn$_6$Sn$_6$.
There is an unconventional dramatic increase in the Seebeck coefficient on
entering the transverse conical spiral (TCS) below $T$ = 200 K suggesting an
unusual scattering of heat carriers. In addition, the observed anomalous
thermal Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect indicates non-zero Berry
curvature in $k$-space. Furthermore, we identify a significant topological
contribution to the thermal Hall and Nernst signals in the TCS phase revealing
the impacts of real-space Berry curvature. We discuss the presence of
topological thermal Hall effect and topological Nernst effect for the first
time in the diverse HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ family. This study illustrates the
importance of transverse thermal and thermoelectric measurements to investigate
the origin of topological transport in the non-coplanar magnetic phases in this
family of kagome metals.

Dynamic and structural heterogeneities play an important role in glass
transition phenomena and in the formation of amorphous structures. Since
structure and dynamics are mutually related, it is expected that there exists
some relation between them; however, this relation has not been characterized
by a direct experiment. Elucidation of this relation is the key to identifying
the structure responsible for the rapid freezing of atomic motion during the
glass transition. In this study, we simultaneously observed the dynamic and
structural heterogeneities near the glass transition temperature in
Zr50Cu40Al10 using five-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy,
which is capable of recording the spatiotemporal distribution of electron
diffraction pattern. Dynamic and structural heterogeneities were visualized
with sub-nanometer resolution upon heating in situ, and a spatial correlation
between them was observed up to the glass transition temperature. Simultaneous
measurements of dynamic and structural heterogeneities directly revealed that
the ordered atomic structure had slow dynamics and that the order decreased
with temperature.

<h3>Vortex phase dynamics in yttrium superhydride YH$_6$ at megabar  pressures</h3>

<i>A.V. Sadakov, V.A. Vlasenko, I.A. Troyan, O.A. Sobolevskiy, D.V. Semenok, Di Zhou, V.M. Pudalov</i>
<br>
<br>
A comprehensive study of the vortex phases and vortex dynamics is presented
for a recently discovered high-temperature superconductor YH$_6$ with T$_C$
(onset) of 215 K under pressure of 200 GPa.Thermal activation energy (U$_0$) is
derived in the framework of thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) theory. The
activation energy yields a power law dependence U$_0$ $\propto$ H$^\alpha$ on
magnetic field with a possible crossover at a field around 8-10 Tesla.
Furthermore, we have depicted the vortex phase transition from vortex-glass to
vortex-liquid state according to the vortex-glass theory. Finally, vortex phase
diagram is constructed for the first time for superhydrides. Very high
estimated values of flux flow barriers U$_0$(H) = 1.5-7*10$^4$ K together with
high crossover fields makes YH$_6$ a rather outstanding superconductor as
compared to most cuprates and iron-based systems. The Ginzburg number for
YH$_6$ Gi = 3-7*10$^{-3}$ indicates that thermal fluctuations are not so strong
and cannot broaden superconducting transitions in weak magnetic fields.

<h3>Electron-phonon coupling and non-equilibrium thermal conduction in  ultrafast heating systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06567" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06567</a>
<br>
<i>Chuang Zhang, Rulei Guo, Meng Lian</i>
<br>
<br>
The electron-phonon coupling in ultrafast heating systems is studied within
the framework of Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with coupled electron and
phonon transport. To directly solve the BTE, a discrete unified gas kinetic
scheme is developed, in which the electron/phonon advection, scattering and
electron-phonon interactions are coupled together within one time step by
solving the BTE at the cell interface. Numerical results show that the present
scheme can correctly predict the electron-phonon coupling constant, and is in
excellent agreement with typical two-temperature model (TTM) and experimental
results in existing literatures and our home-made time-domain thermoreflectance
technique in ultrafast laser heating problem. In the transient thermal grating
(TTG) geometry, the present scheme not only recovers the TTM in the diffusive
regime, but also captures the ballistic and thermal wave effects when the
characteristic length is comparable to or smaller than the mean free path where
the TTM fails. More interestingly, an unexpected heat flow from phonon to
electron is predicted in both the ballistic and diffusive regimes in the TTG
geometry. It results from the competition of the thermal diffusivity and
electron-phonon coupling in the diffusive regime, and in the ballistic regime
it results from the competition of the phonon/electron advection and
electron-phonon coupling.

<h3>SPT phases for stacked system and mixed states in one dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06589" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06589</a>

<i>Hanyu Xue</i>
<br>
<br>
This study explores the specific structure of 1D SPT phases with $G\times H$
symmetry ($G, H$ are finite non-Abelian groups) and constructs an order
parameter. We demonstrate that this order parameter can comprehensively
describe this specific structure. Utilizing this order parameter, we prove that
when the SPT phase theory of symmetry $G$ is extended to mixed states, if the
density matrix is treated as a pure SPT state with $G\times G$ symmetry, the
Hermiticity and positive semi-definiteness ensure that the SPT phase of the
mixed state is similarly described by $H^2(G)$. Finally, we propose that under
this perspective, the SPT phase of time-reversal symmetry no longer exists in
mixed states.

<h3>Engineering of anomalous Josephson effect in coherently coupled  Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>Sadashige Matsuo, Takaya Imoto, Tomohiro Yokoyama, Yosuke Sato, Tyler Lindemann, Sergei Gronin, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Michael J. Manfra, Seigo Tarucha</i>
<br>
<br>
A Josephson junction (JJ) is a key device in the development of
superconducting circuits, wherein a supercurrent in the JJ is controlled by the
phase difference between the two superconducting electrodes. Recently, it has
been shown that the JJ current is nonlocally controlled by the phase difference
of another nearby JJ via coherent coupling. Here, we use the nonlocal control
to engineer the anomalous Josephson effect. We observe that a supercurrent is
produced by the nonlocal phase control even without any local phase difference,
using a quantum interference device. The nonlocal phase control simultaneously
generates an offset of a local phase difference giving the JJ ground state.
These results provide novel concepts for engineering superconducting devices
such as phase batteries and dissipationless rectifiers.

<h3>Directedeness, correlations, and daily cycles in springbok motion: from  data over stochastic models to movement prediction</h3>

<br>
<br>
How predictable is the next move of an animal? Specifically, which factors
govern the short- and long-term motion patterns and the overall dynamics of
landbound, plant-eating animals and ruminants in particular? To answer this
question, we here study the movement dynamics of springbok antelopes Antidorcas
marsupialis. We propose complementary statistical analysis techniques combined
with machine learning approaches to analyze, across multiple time scales, the
springbok motion recorded in long-term GPS-tracking of collared springboks at a
private wildlife reserve in Namibia. As a new result, we are able to predict
the springbok movement within the next hour with a certainty of about 20\%. The
remaining 80\% are stochastic in nature and are induced by unaccounted factors
in the modeling algorithm and by individual behavioral features of springboks.
We find that directedness of motion contributes approximately 17\% to this
predicted fraction. We find that the measure for directedeness is strongly
dependent on the daily cycle. The previously known daily affinity of springboks
to their water points, as predicted from our machine learning algorithm,
overall accounts for only 3\% of this predicted deterministic component of
springbok motion. Moreover, the resting points are found to affect the motion
of springboks at least as much as the formally studied effects of water points.
The generality of these statements for the motion patterns and their underlying
behavioral reasons for other ruminants can be examined on the basis of our
statistical analysis tools.

<h3>Highly tunable lateral homojunction formed in 2D layered CuInP2S6 via  in-plane ionic migration</h3>

<br>
<br>
As basic building blocks for next-generation information technologies
devices, high-quality p-n junctions based on van der Waals (vdW) materials have
attracted widespread interest.Compared to traditional two dimensional (2D)
heterojunction diodes, the emerging homojunctions are more attractive owing to
their intrinsic advantages, such as continuous band alignments and smaller
carrier trapping. Here, utilizing the long-range migration of Cu + ions under
in-plane electric field, a novel lateral p-n homojunction was constructed in
the 2D layered copper indium thiophosphate (CIPS). The symmetric Au/CIPS/Au
devices demonstrate an electric-field-driven resistance switching (RS)
accompanying by a rectification behavior without any gate control. Moreover,
such rectification behavior can be continuously modulated by poling voltage. We
deduce that the reversable rectifying RS behavior is governed by the effective
lateral build-in potential and the change of the interfacial barrier during the
poling process. Furthermore, the CIPS p-n homojuction is evidenced by the
photovoltaic effect, with the spectral response extending up to visible region
due to the better photogenerated carrier separation efficiency. Our study
provides a facile route to fabricate homojuctions through electric-field-driven
ionic migration and paves the way towards the use of this method in other vdW
materials.

<h3>Backdoor to the Hidden Ground State: Planted Vertex Cover Example</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06610" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06610</a>

<i>Xin-Yi Fan, Hai-Jun Zhou</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and
study it by the cavity method. The equilibrium ordering phase transition of
this binary-spin two-body interaction system is discontinuous in nature
distinct from the continuous one of conventional Ising-like models, and it is
dynamically blocked by an extensive free energy barrier. We discover that the
disordered symmetric phase of this system may be locally stable with respect to
the ordered phase at all inverse temperatures except for a unique eureka point
$\beta_b$ at which it is only marginally stable. The eureka point $\beta_b$
serves as a backdoor to access the hidden ground state with vanishing free
energy barrier. It exists in an infinite series of planted random graph
ensembles and we determine their structural parameters analytically. The
revealed new type of free energy landscape may also exist in other planted
random-graph optimization problems at the interface of statistical physics and
statistical inference.

<h3>Mpemba effect for a Brownian particle trapped in a single well potential</h3>

<br>
<br>
Mpemba effect refers to the counterintuitive phenomenon of a hotter system
equilibrating faster than a colder system when both are quenched to the same
low temperature. For a Brownian particle trapped in a piece-wise linear single
well potential that is devoid of any other metastable minima we show the
existence of Mpemba effect for a wide range of parameters through an exact
solution. This result challenges the prevalent explanation of the Mpemba effect
that requires the energy landscape to be rugged with multiple minima. We also
demonstrate the existence of inverse and strong Mpemba effects.

Transition metal-intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are
promising platforms for next-generation spintronic devices based on their wide
range of electronic and magnetic phases, which can be tuned by varying the host
lattice or the identity of the intercalant, along with its stoichiometry and
spatial order. Some of these compounds host a chiral magnetic phase in which
the helical winding of magnetic moments propagates along a high-symmetry
crystalline axis. Previous studies have demonstrated that variation in
intercalant concentrations can have a dramatic impact on the formation of
chiral domains and ensemble magnetic properties. However, a systematic and
comprehensive study of how atomic-scale order and disorder impacts collective
magnetic behavior are so far lacking. Here, we leverage a combination of
imaging modes in the (scanning) transmission electron microscope (S/TEM) to
directly probe (dis)order across multiple length scales and show how subtle
changes in the atomic lattice can be leveraged to tune the mesoscale spin
textures and bulk magnetic response, with direct implications for the
fundamental understanding and technological implementation of such compounds.

Altermagnet (AM) is a novel time reversal symmetry broken magnetic phase with
$d$-wave order. We discuss theoretical models of altermagnet based systems on
lattice and in continuum that are amenable to experimental measurements and
show equivalence between the two models. We study (i) altermagnet-normal metal
(NM) and (ii) altermagnet-ferromagnet (FM) junctions, with the aim to quantify
transport properties such as conductivity and magnetoresistance. We find that a
spin current accompanies charge current when a bias is applied. The
magnetoresistance of the AM-FM junction switches sign when AM is rotated by
$90^{\circ}$, -a feature unique to the altermagnetic phase.

<br>
<br>
Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combined with first
principle and coupled self-consistent Poisson-Schr\"odinger calculations, we
demonstrate that potassium (K) atoms adsorbed on the low-temperature phase of
1$T$-TiSe$_2$ induce the creation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and
quantum confinement of its charge-density-wave (CDW) at the surface. By further
changing the K coverage, we tune the carrier-density within the 2DEG that
allows us to nullify, at the surface, the electronic energy gain due to exciton
condensation in the CDW phase while preserving a long-range structural order.
Our study constitutes a prime example of a controlled exciton-related many-body
quantum state in reduced dimensionality by alkali-metal dosing.

<br>
A two-dimensional layer of oxide reveals itself as a essential element to
drive the photocatalytic activity in a nanostructured hybrid material, which
combines high-quality epitaxial graphene and titanium dioxide nanoparticles. In
particular, it has been revealed that the addition of a 2D Ti oxide layer
sandwiched between graphene and metal induces a p-doping of graphene and a
consistent shift in the Ti d states. These modifications induced by the
interfacial oxide layer induce a reduction of the probability of charge carrier
recombination and enhance the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure.
This is indicative of a capital role played by thin oxide films in fine-tuning
the properties of heterostructures based on graphene and pave the way to new
combinations of graphene/oxides for photocatalysis-oriented applications.

<h3>Ordering Dynamics of the Random Field Long-range Ising Model in One  Dimension</h3>

<br>
<i>Ramgopal Agrawal, Federico Corberi, Eugenio Lippiello, Sanjay Puri</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the influence of long-range (LR) interactions on the phase
ordering dynamics of the one-dimensional random field Ising model (RFIM).
Unlike the usual RFIM, a spin interacts with all other spins through a
ferromagnetic coupling that decays as $r^{-(1+\sigma)}$, where $r$ is the
distance between two spins. In the absence of LR interactions, the size of
coarsening domains $R(t)$ exhibits a crossover from pure system behavior $R(t)
\sim t^{1/2}$ to an asymptotic regime characterized by logarithmic growth:
$R(t) \sim (\ln t)^2$. The LR interactions affect the pre-asymptotic regime,
which now exhibits ballistic growth $R(t) \sim t$, followed by
$\sigma$-dependent growth $R(t) \sim t^{1/(1+\sigma)}$. Additionally, the LR
interactions also affect the asymptotic logarithmic growth, which becomes $R(t)
\sim (\ln t)^{\alpha(\sigma)}$ with $\alpha(\sigma) < 2$. Thus, LR interactions
lead to faster growth than for the nearest-neighbor system at short times.
Unexpectedly, this driving force causes a slowing-down of the dynamics ($\alpha
< 2$) in the asymptotic logarithmic regime. This is explained in terms of a
non-trivial competition between the pinning force caused by the random field
and the driving force introduced by LR interactions. We also study the spatial
correlation function and the autocorrelation function of the magnetization
field. The former exhibits superuniversality for all $\sigma$, i.e., a scaling
function that is independent of the disorder strength. The same holds for the
autocorrelation function when $\sigma<1$, whereas clear violation of
superuniversality is seen for $\sigma>1$.

<h3>Nonmonotonic buildup of spin-singlet correlations in a double quantum  dot</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dynamical buildup of spin-singlet correlations between the two quantum dots
is investigated by means of the time-dependent numerical renormalization group
method. By calculating the timeevolution of the spin-spin expectation value
upon a quench in the hopping between the quantum dots, we examine the time
scales associated with the development of an entangled spin-singlet state in
the system. Interestingly, we find that in short time scales the effective
exchange interaction between the quantum dots is of ferromagnetic type,
favoring spin-triplet correlations, as opposite to the long time limit, when
strong antiferromagnetic correlations develop and eventually an entangled
spin-singlet state is formed between the dots. We also numerically determine
the relevant time scales and show that the physics is generally governed by the
interplay between the Kondo correlations on each dot and exchange interaction
between the spins of both quantum dots.

<h3>Ab initio study of the structural, vibrational and optical properties of  potential parent structures of nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride</h3>

<br>
<br>
The recent report of near-ambient conditions superconductivity in a
nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride has inspired a large number of experimental
studies with contradictory results. We model from first principles the physical
properties of the possible parent structures of the reported superconductor,
LuH$_2$ and LuH$_3$. We show that only the phonon band structure of LuH$_3$ can
explain the reported Raman spectra due to the presence of hydrogens at the
interstitial octahedral sites. However, this structure is stabilized by
anharmonicity only above 6 GPa. We find that the intriguing color change with
pressure in the reported superconductor is consistent with the optical
properties of LuH$_2$, which are determined by the presence of an undamped
interband plasmon. The plasmon blue-shifts with pressure and modifies the color
of the sample without requiring any structural phase transition. Our findings
suggest that the main component in the experiments is LuH$_2$ with some extra
hydrogen atoms at octahedral sites. None of LuH$_2$ and LuH$_3$ superconduct at
high temperatures.

<br>
<br>
Modulation of the Fermi level using an ultraviolet (UV)-assisted
photochemical method is demonstrated in tungsten diselenide monolayers.
Systematic shifts and relative intensities between charged and neutral exciton
species indicate a progressive and controllable decrease of the electron
density and switch tungsten diselenide from n-type to a p-type semiconductor.
The presence of chlorine in the 2D crystal shifts the Fermi level closer to the
valence band while the effect can be only partially reversible via continuous
wave laser rastering process. The presence of chlorine species in the lattice
is validated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations predict that adsorption of chlorine on the selenium
vacancy sites leads to p-type doping. The results of our study indicate that
photochemical techniques have the potential to enhance the performance of
various 2D materials, making them suitable for potential applications in
optoelectronics.

<h3>Reactive pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering deposition of  semiconducting yttrium oxide thin film in ultralow oxygen atmosphere: A  spectroscopic and structural investigation of growth dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
An experimental investigation was conducted to explore spectroscopic and
structural characterization of semiconducting yttrium oxide thin film deposited
at 623 K (+/- 5K) utilizing reactive pulsed direct current magnetron
sputtering. Based on the results obtained from both x-ray diffraction and
transmission electron microscope measurements, yttrium monoxide is very likely
formed in the transition region between {\beta}-Y2O3 and {\alpha}-Y2O3, and
accompanied by the crystalline Y2O3. Resulting from either the low energy
separation between 4d and 5s orbitals and/or different spin states of the
corresponding orbitals' sublevels, the stability of monoxide is most presumably
self-limited by the size of the crystal in thermodynamic terms. This behavior
develops a distortion in the structure of the crystal compared to the metal
oxide cubic structure and it also effectuates the arrangement in
nanocrystalline/amorphous phase. In addition to this, spectroscopic
ellipsometry denotes that the semiconducting yttrium oxide has the dominant,
mostly amorphous, formation character over crystalline Y2O3. Our purpose, by
means of the current findings, is to advance the understanding of formation
kinetics/conditions of yttrium with an unusual valency (2+).

Superconductivity in laser-excited correlated electron systems has attracted
considerable interest due to reports of light-induced superconducting-like
states. Here we explore the possibility of non-thermal superconducting order in
strongly interacting multi-orbital Hubbard systems, using non-equilibrium
dynamical mean field theory. We find that a staggered $\eta$-type
superconducting phase can be realized on a bipartite lattice in the high
photo-doping regime, if the effective temperature of the photo-carriers is
sufficiently low. The $\eta$ superconducting state is stabilized by Hund
coupling - a positive Hund coupling favors orbital-singlet spin-triplet $\eta$
pairing, whereas a negative Hund coupling stabilizes spin-singlet
orbital-triplet $\eta$ pairing.

Nano-constriction based spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) are at the
forefront of spintronics research for emerging technological applications such
as oscillator-based neuromorphic computing and Ising Machines. However, their
miniaturization to the sub-50 nm width regime results in poor scaling of the
threshold current. Here, we show that current shunting through the Si substrate
is the origin of this problem and study how different seed layers can mitigate
it. We find that an ultra-thin Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ seed layer and SiN (200 nm)
coated p-Si substrates provide the best improvement, enabling us to scale down
the SHNO width to a truly nanoscopic dimension of 10 nm, operating at threshold
currents below 30 $\mu$A. In addition, the combination of electrical insulation
and high thermal conductivity of the Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ seed will offer the best
conditions for large SHNO arrays, avoiding any significant temperature
gradients within the array. Our state-of-the-art ultra-low operational current
SHNOs hence pave an energy-efficient route to scale oscillator-based computing
to large dynamical neural networks of linear chains or two-dimensional arrays.

A methodology for forming a qubit state is essential for quantum applications
of room temperature polaritons. While polarization degree of freedom is
expected as a possible means for this purpose, the coupling of linearly
polarized polariton condensed states has been still a challenging issue. In
this study, we show a polarization superposition of a polariton condensed
states in an all-inorganic perovskite microcavity at room temperature. We
realized the energy resonance of the two orthogonally polarized polariton modes
with the same number of antinodes by exploiting the blue shift of the polariton
condensed state. The polarization coupling between the condensed states results
in a polarization switching in the polariton lasing emission. The orthorhombic
crystal structure of the perovskite active layer and/or a slight off-axis
orientation of the perovskite crystal axis from the normal direction of
microcavity plane enable the interaction between the two orthogonally polarized
states. These observations demonstrate a great promise of polariton as a room
temperature qubit technology.

Study of the local optical properties using electron beam (e-beam) can
provide a valuable information concerning the inspection of the materials
quality, the presence of the different phase inclusions and defects. Halide
perovskites have been shown to be highly sensitive to external stress
conditions like ambient atmosphere, light, and heat. In this paper, the
cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy has been exploited to carry out the
investigation of CH3NH3PbBr3 monocrystals under low energy electron beam
irradiation. The CL spectra exhibited strong transformation with the increase
of the irradiation dose and significant shifts of the peak maximums from 2.23
eV to >2.5 eV. Utilizing a larger e-beam energy (>20 keV) was found to be
preferable to slow down the dynamics of the decomposition and corrosion. The
mechanisms of the changes in MAPbBr3 properties after e-beam exposure and
correlation to the in-depth distribution of deposited energy were discussed.

<h3>Vibrations and tunneling of strained nanoribbons at finite temperature</h3>

Crystalline sheets (e.g., graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides)
liberated from a substrate are a paradigm for materials at criticality because
flexural phonons can fluctuate into the third dimension. Although studies of
static critical behaviors (e.g., the scale-dependent elastic constants) are
plentiful, investigations of dynamics remain limited. Here, we use molecular
dynamics to study the time dependence of the midpoint (the height
center-of-mass) of doubly clamped nanoribbons, as prototypical graphene
resonators, under a wide range of temperature and strain conditions. By
treating the ribbon midpoint as a Brownian particle confined to a nonlinear
potential (which assumes a double-well shape beyond the buckling transition),
we formulate an effective theory describing the ribbon's tunneling rate across
the two wells and its oscillations inside a given well. We find that, for
nanoribbbons compressed above the Euler buckling point and thermalized above a
temperature at which the non-linear effects due to thermal fluctuations become
significant, the exponential term (the ratio between energy barrier and
temperature) depends only on the geometry, but not the temperature, unlike the
usual Arrhenius behavior. Moreover, we find that the natural oscillation time
for small strain shows a non-trivial scaling $\tau_{\rm o}\sim
L_0^{\,z}T^{-\eta/4}$, with $L_0$ being the ribbon length, $z=2-\eta/2$ being
the dynamic critical exponent, $\eta=0.8$ being the scaling exponent describing
scale-dependent elastic constants, and $T$ being the temperature. These unusual
scale- and temperature-dependent dynamics thus exhibit dynamic criticality and
could be exploited in the development of graphene-based nanoactuators.

The Schr\"{o}dinger equation with random potentials is a fundamental model
for understanding the behaviour of particles in disordered systems. Disordered
media are characterised by complex potentials that lead to the localisation of
wavefunctions, also called Anderson localisation. These wavefunctions may have
similar scales of eigenenergies which poses difficulty in their discovery. It
has been a longstanding challenge due to the high computational cost and
complexity of solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Recently, machine-learning
tools have been adopted to tackle these challenges. In this paper, based upon
recent advances in machine learning, we present a novel approach for
discovering localised eigenstates in disordered media using physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs). We focus on the spectral approximation of Hamiltonians
in one dimension with potentials that are randomly generated according to the
Bernoulli, normal, and uniform distributions. We introduce a novel feature to
the loss function that exploits known physical phenomena occurring in these
regions to scan across the domain and successfully discover these eigenstates,
regardless of the similarity of their eigenenergies. We present various
examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it
with isogeometric analysis.

The contact process is an emblematic model of a non-equilibrium system,
containing a phase transition between inactive and active dynamical regimes. In
the epidemiological context, the model is known as the
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, and widely used to describe
contagious spreading. In this work, we demonstrate how accurate and efficient
representations of the full probability distribution over all configurations of
the contact process on a one-dimensional chain can be obtained by means of
Matrix Product States (MPS). We modify and adapt MPS methods from many-body
quantum systems to study the classical distributions of the driven contact
process at late times. We give accurate and efficient results for the
distribution of large gaps, and illustrate the advantage of our methods over
Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we study the large deviation statistics
of the dynamical activity, defined as the total number of configuration changes
along a trajectory, and investigate quantum-inspired entropic measures, based
on the second R\'enyi entropy.

In this study, an efficient first-principles approach for calculating the
thermodynamic properties of mixed metal oxides at high temperatures is
demonstrated. More precisely, this procedure combines density functional theory
and harmonic phonon calculations with tabulated thermochemical data to predict
the heat capacity, formation energy, and entropy of important metal oxides.
Alloy cluster expansions are, moreover, employed to represent phases that
display chemical ordering as well as to calculate the configurational
contribution to the specific heat capacity. The methodology can, therefore, be
applied to compounds with vacancies and variable site occupancies. Results are,
moreover, presented for a number of systems of high practical relevance:
Fe-K-Ti-O, K-Mn-O, and Ca-Mn-O. In the case of ilmenite (FeTiO3), the agreement
with experimental measurements is exceptionally good. When the generated data
is used in multi-phase thermodynamic calculations to represent materials for
which experimental data is not available, the predicted phase-diagrams for the
K-Mn-O and K-Ti-O systems change dramatically. The demonstrated methodology is
highly useful for obtaining approximate values on key thermodynamic properties
in cases where experimental data is hard to obtain, inaccurate or missing.

<br>

Motivated by a recent breakthrough transport experiment (arXiv:2207.02472) in
Majorana nanowires, we study theoretically local and nonlocal transport in
Majorana nanowires in various disorder regimes, correlating the transport
properties with the corresponding local and total density of states as well as
various topological diagnostics. We find three distinct disorder regimes, with
weak (strong) disorder regimes manifesting (not manifesting) topological
superconductivity with clear end Majorana zero modes for longer (but not
necessarily for shorter) wires. The intermediate disorder regime is both
interesting and challenging because the topology depends on many details in
addition to the strength of disorder, such as the precise disorder
configuration and the wire length. The intermediate disorder regime often
manifests multiple effective transitions between topological and nontopological
phases as a function of system parameters (e.g., the Zeeman field), and is
consistent with the recent Microsoft experiment reflecting small topological
gaps and narrow topological regimes in the parameter space.

The interplay between light-matter, spin-orbit, and magnetic interactions
allows the investigation of light-induced magnetic phenomena that is otherwise
absent without irradiation. We present our analysis of light-driving effects on
the interlayer exchange coupling mediated by a bulk Rashba semiconductor in a
magnetic multilayer. The collinear magnetic exchange coupling mediated by the
photon-dressed spin-orbit coupled electrons of BiTeI develops light-induced
oscillation periods and displays new decay powers laws, both of which are
enhanced with an increasing light-matter coupling. For magnetic layers with
non-collinear magnetization, we find a non-collinear magnetic exchange coupling
uniquely generated by light-driving of the multilayer. As the non-collinear
magnetic exchange coupling mediated by the electrons of BiTeI is unique to the
irradiated system and it is enhanced with increasing light-matter coupling,
this effect offers a promising platform of investigation of light-driving
effects on magnetic phenomena in spin-orbit coupled systems.

realize the connection in the ultra-high vacuum chamber, bypassing the standard
feedthrough. A bandwidth up to 4 GHz with -6 dB attenuation was measured at the

Efficient artificial photosynthesis systems are currently realized as
catalyst- and surfacefunctionalized photovoltaic tandem- and triple-junction
devices, enabling photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation while
simultaneously recycling CO2 and generating hydrogen as a solar fuel for
storable renewable energy. Although PEC systems also bear advantages for the
activation of dinitrogen - such as a high system tunability with respect to the
electrocatalyst integration and a directly controllable electron flux to the
anchoring catalyst through the adjustability of incoming irradiation - only a
few PEC devices have been developed and investigated for this purpose. We have
developed a series of photoelectrodeposition procedures to deposit mixed-metal
electrocatalyst nanostructures directly on the semiconductor surface for
light-assisted dinitrogen activation. These electrocatalyst compositions
containing Co, Mo and Ru in different atomic ratios follow previously made
recommendations of metal compositions for dinitrogen reduction and exhibit
different physical properties. XPS studies of the photoelectrode surfaces
reveal that our electrocatalyst films are to a large degree nitrogen-free after
their fabrication, which is generally difficult to achieve with traditional
magnetron sputtering or e-beam evaporation techniques. Initial
chronoamperometric measurements of the p-InP photoelectrode coated with the
Co-Mo alloy electrocatalyst show higher photocurrent densities in the presence
of N2(g) than in the presence of Ar at -0.09 V vs RHE. Indications of
successful dinitrogen activation have also been found in consecutive XPS
studies, where both, N 1s and Mo 3d spectra, reveal evidence of nitrogen-metal
interactions.

Terahertz (THz) Spintronic emitters based on ferromagnetic/metal junctions
have become an important technology for the THz range, offering powerful and
ultra-large spectral bandwidths. These developments have driven recent
investigations of two-dimensional (2D) materials for new THz spintronic
concepts. 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are
ideal platforms for SCC as they possess strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
reduced crystal symmetries. Moreover, SCC and the resulting THz emission can be
tuned with the number of layers, electric field or strain. Here, epitaxially
grown 1T-PtSe$_2$ and sputtered Ferromagnet (FM) heterostructures are presented
as a novel THz emitter where the 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC.
High quality of as-grown PtSe$_2$ layers is demonstrated and further FM
deposition leaves the PtSe$_2$ unaffected, as evidenced with extensive
characterization. Through this atomic growth control, the unique thickness
dependent electronic structure of PtSe$_2$ allows the control of the THz
emission by SCC. Indeed, we demonstrate the transition from the inverse
Rashba-Edelstein effect in one monolayer to the inverse spin Hall effect in
multilayers. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe$_2$ an ideal candidate
as a THz spintronic 2D material and to explore the underlying mechanisms and
engineering of the SCC for THz emission.

Nonlinear interactions are crucial in science and engineering. Here, we
investigate wave interactions in a highly nonlinear magnetic system driven by
parametric pumping leading to Bose--Einstein condensation of spin-wave quanta
-- magnons. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in yttrium-iron
garnet films, we found and identified a set of nonlinear processes resulting in
off-resonant spin-wave excitations -- virtual magnons. In particular, we
discovered a dynamically-strong, correlation-enhanced four-wave interaction
process of the magnon condensate with pairs of parametric magnons having
opposite wavevectors and fully correlated phases.

We consider a system of interacting spinless fermions on a two-leg triangular
ladder with $\pi/2$ magnetic flux per triangular plaquette. Microscopically,
the system exhibits a U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of total
fermionic charge, and a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry -- a product of parity
transformation and permutation of the chains. Using bosonization, we show that,
in the low-energy limit, the system is described by the quantum
double-frequency sine-Gordon model. On the basis of this correspondence, a rich
phase diagram of the system is obtained. It includes a trivial and a
topological band insulators for weak interactions, separated by a Gaussian
critical line, whereas at larger interactions a strongly correlated phase with
spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry sets in, exhibiting a net charge
imbalance and non-zero total current. At the intersection of the three phases,
the system features a critical point with an emergent SU(2) symmetry. This
non-Abelian symmetry, absent in the microscopic description, is realized as a
combined effect of the magnetic flux, frustration, and many-body correlations.
The criticality belongs to the SU(2)$_1$ Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten
universality class. The critical point bifurcates into two Ising critical lines
that separate the band insulators from the strong-coupling symmetry broken
phase. We establish an analytical connection between the low-energy description
of our model around the critical bifurcation point on one hand, and the
Ashkin-Teller model and a weakly dimerized XXZ spin-1/2 chain on the other. We
complement our field-theory understanding via large-scale tensor network
simulations, providing compelling quantitative evidences of all bosonization
predictions. Our findings are of interest to up-to-date cold atom experiments
utilizing Rydberg dressing, that have already demonstrated correlated ladder
dynamics.

The properties of lithium metal are key parameters in the design of lithium
ion and lithium metal batteries. They are difficult to probe experimentally due
to the high reactivity and low melting point of lithium as well as the
microscopic scales at which lithium exists in batteries where it is found to
have enhanced strength, with implications for dendrite suppression strategies.
Computationally, there is a lack of empirical potentials that are consistently
quantitatively accurate across all properties and ab-initio calculations are
too costly. In this work, we train Machine Learning Interaction Potentials
(MLIPs) on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to state-of-the-art accuracy in
reproducing experimental and ab-initio results across a wide range of
simulations at large length and time scales. We accurately predict
thermodynamic properties, phonon spectra, temperature dependence of elastic
constants and various surface properties inaccessible using DFT. We establish
that there exists a Bell-Evans-Polanyi relation correlating the self-adsorption
energy and the minimum surface diffusion barrier for high Miller index facets.

Exact functional renormalization group (FRG) flow equations for quantum
systems can be derived directly within an operator formalism without using
functional integrals. This simple insight opens new possibilities for applying
FRG methods to models for strongly correlated electrons with projected Hilbert
spaces, such as quantum spin models, the $t$-$J$ model, or the Hubbard model at
infinite on-site repulsion. By representing these models in terms of Hubbard
X-operators, we derive exact flow equations for the time-ordered correlation
functions of the X-operators (X-FRG), which allow us to calculate the
electronic correlation functions in the projected Hilbert space of these
models. The Hubbard-I approximation for the single-particle Green function of
the Hubbard model is recovered from a trivial truncation of the flow equations
where the two-point vertex is approximated by its atomic limit. We use our
approach to calculate the quasi-particle residue and damping in the ``hidden
Fermi liquid'' state of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where
the Hamiltonian consists only of the projected kinetic energy.

Recently, unconventional topological quasiparticles have been attracting
significant research interest in condensed matter physics. Here, based on
first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we reveal the coexistence
of multiple types of interesting unconventional topological quasiparticles in
the phonon spectrum of chiral crystal CsBe$_2$F$_5$. Specifically, we
identified eight entangled phonon bands in CsBe$_2$F$_5$, which gave rise to
various unconventional topological quasiparticles, including the spin-1 Weyl
point, the charge-2 Dirac point, the nodal surface, and the novel hourglass
nodal loop. We demonstrate that these unconventional topological quasiparticles
are protected by crystal symmetry. We show that there are two large Fermi arcs
connecting projections of the bulk spin-1 Weyl point and charge-2 Dirac point
on the (001) surface and across the entire surface Brillouin zone (BZ). Our
work not only elucidate the intriguing topological properties of chiral
crystals but also provides an excellent material platform for exploring the
fascinating physics associated with multiple types of unconventional
topological quasiparticles.

The paper presents results of a comprehensive study from first principles
into the properties of Ni, Pd, Rh, and Ir crystals under pressure. We
calculated elastic constants, phonon spectra, isotherms, Hugoniots, sound
velocities, relative structural stability, and phase diagrams. It is shown that
in nickel and palladium under high pressures ($>$0.14 TPa) and temperatures
($>$4 kK), the body-centered cubic structure is thermodynamically most stable
instead of the face-centered cubic one. Calculated results suggest that nickel
under Earth-core conditions ($P$$\sim$0.3 TPa, $T$$\sim$6 kK) have a bcc
structure. No structural changes were found to occur in Rh and Ir under
pressures to 1 TPa at least. The paper also provides estimations for the
pressure and temperature at which the metals of interest begin to melt under
shock compression.

<h3>Quantum reaction-limited reaction-diffusion dynamics of annihilation  processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06944" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06944</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriele Perfetto, Federico Carollo, Juan P. Garrahan, Igor Lesanovsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics of fermionic particles
which coherently hop in a one-dimensional lattice and undergo annihilation
reactions. The latter are modelled as dissipative processes which involve
losses of pairs $2A \to \emptyset$, triplets $3A \to \emptyset$ and quadruplets
$4A \to \emptyset$ of neighbouring particles. When considering classical
particles, the corresponding decay of their density in time follows an
asymptotic power-law behavior. The associated exponent in one dimension is
different from the mean-field prediction whenever diffusive mixing is not too
strong and spatial correlations are relevant. This specifically applies to
$2A\to \emptyset$, while the mean-field prediction just acquires a log
correction for $3A \to \emptyset$ and is exact for $4A \to \emptyset$. A
mean-field approach is also valid, for all the three processes, when the
diffusive mixing is strong, i.e., in the so-called reaction-limited regime.
Here, we show that the picture is quite different for quantum systems. We
consider the quantum reaction-limited regime and we show that for all the three
processes power-law behavior beyond mean-field is present as a consequence of
quantum coherences, which are not related to space dimensionality. In the case
of $3A\to \emptyset$, we further show that power-law behavior only appears
within an intermediate time window, while at long times the density decay is
not power-law. Our results show the markedly different origin of the richer
universal behavior in quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics as compared to its
classical formulation.

<h3>Twisted bilayer graphene at charge neutrality: competing orders of SU(4)  Dirac fermions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study possible patterns for spontaneous symmetry breaking in a Dirac
fermion model, which is applicable to twisted bilayer graphene at charge
neutrality. We show how a chiral SU(4) symmetry emerges and construct the
corresponding low-energy model that includes a Fierz-complete set of
symmetry-allowed four-fermion interactions. We employ an unbiased
renormalization group treatment to identify the critical points that describe
transitions into different ordered phases. The resulting phase diagram depends
on the number of fermion flavours and we show that the coupling between
ordering channels prevents many of the possible mean-field orders from being
accessible at relevant, small flavour numbers. We argue that, as a consequence,
twisted bilayer graphene is governed by a quantum Hall state or an SU(4)
manifold of insulating spin-valley orders with emergent Lorentz symmetry that
contains inter-valley coherent, spin Hall, and valley Hall states. We study how
SU(4)-breaking perturbations affect the accessibility and can additionally
stabilize symmetry-broken (semi-)metallic states.

<h3>Multiple polaritonic edge states in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain  strongly coupled to a multimode cavity</h3>

<br>
<br>
A dimerized chain of dipolar emitters strongly coupled to a multimode optical
cavity is studied. By integrating out the photonic degrees of freedom of the
cavity, the system is recast in a two-band model with an effective long-range
coupling, so that it mimicks a variation of the paradigmatic
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which features a nontrivial topological phase and
hosts topological edge states. In the strong-coupling regime, the cavity
photons hybridize the bright dipolar bulk band into a polaritonic one,
renormalizing the eigenspectrum and strongly breaking chiral symmetry. This
leads to a formal loss of the in-gap edge states present in the topological
phase while they merge into the polaritonic bulk band. Interestingly, however,
we find that bulk polaritons entering in resonance with the edge states inherit
part of their localization properties, so that multiple polaritonic edge states
are observed. Although these states are not fully localized on the edges, they
present unusual properties. In particular, due to their delocalized bulk part,
owing from their polaritonic nature, such edge states exhibit efficient
transport characteristics. Instead of being degenerate, they occupy a large
portion of the spectrum, allowing one to probe them in a wide driving frequency
range. Moreover, being reminiscent of symmetry-protected topological edge
states, they feature a strong tolerance to off-diagonal disorder.

<h3>First-order phase transition between superconductivity and  charge/spin-density wave as the reason of their coexistence in organic metals</h3>

The interplay between superconductivity (SC) and spin/charge density wave
(DW) in organic metals shows many similarities to high-$T_c$ superconductors.
It also contains many puzzles, for example, the anisotropic SC onset observed
and the severalfold increase of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ in the
coexistence region, as well as the microscopic origin of SC/DW phase separation
there. In this paper, by the direct calculation of the Landau expansion for DW
free energy, we argue that the phase transition between DW and metallic/SC
phase in organic superconductors goes by first order at low enough temperature,
which explains the spatial segregation of DW and SC at large length scale,
consistent with experimental observations. This first-order phase transition is
not directly related to SC and happens even above the SC transition
temperature.

Transonic defect motion is of interest for high strain-rate plastic
deformation as well as for crack propagation. Ever since Eshelby's 1949
prediction in the isotropic limit of a 'radiation-free' transonic velocity
$v_\text{RF}=\sqrt{2}c_{\textrm{T}}$, where shock waves are absent, there has
been speculation about the significance of radiation-free velocities for defect
mobility. Here, we argue that they do not play any significant role in
dislocation dynamics in metals, based on comparing theoretical predictions of
radiation-free velocities for transonic edge dislocations with molecular
dynamics simulations for two face-centered cubic (FCC) metals: Cu, which has no
radiation-free states, and Ag, which does.

<br>
<br>
Boron phosphide (BP) is a (super)hard semiconductor constituted of light
elements, which is promising for high demand applications at extreme
conditions. The behavior of BP at high temperatures and pressures is of special
interest but is also poorly understood because both experimental and
conventional ab initio methods are restricted to studying refractory covalent
materials. The use of machine learning interatomic potentials is a
revolutionary trend that gives a unique opportunity for high-temperature study
of materials with ab initio accuracy. We develop a deep machine learning
potential (DP) for accurate atomistic simulations of solid and liquid phases of
BP as well as their transformations near the melting line. Our DP provides
quantitative agreement with experimental and ab initio molecular dynamics data
for structural and dynamic properties. DP-based simulations reveal that at
ambient pressure tetrahedrally bonded cubic BP crystal melts into an open
structure consisting of two interpenetrating sub-networks of boron and
phosphorous with different structures. Structure transformations of BP melts
under compressing are reflected by the evolution of low-pressure tetrahedral
coordination to high-pressure octahedral coordination. The main contributions
to structural changes at low pressures are made by the evolution of
medium-range order in B-subnetwork and at high pressures by the change of
short-range order in P-sub-network. Such transformations exhibit an anomalous
behavior of structural characteristics in the range of 12--15 GPa. Analysis of
the results obtained raise open issues in developing machine learning
potentials for covalent materials and stimulate further experimental and
theoretical studies of melting behavior in BP.

Understanding superfluidity remains a major goal of condensed matter physics.
Here we tackle this challenge utilizing the recently developed Fermionic neural
network (FermiNet) wave function Ansatz for variational Monte Carlo
calculations. We study the unitary Fermi gas, a system with strong,
short-range, two-body interactions known to possess a superfluid ground state
but difficult to describe quantitively. We demonstrate key limitations of the
FermiNet Ansatz in studying the unitary Fermi gas and propose a simple
modification that outperforms the original FermiNet significantly, giving
highly accurate results. We prove mathematically that the new Ansatz is a
strict generalization of the original FermiNet architecture, despite the use of
fewer parameters. Our approach shares several advantanges with the FermiNet:
the use of a neural network removes the need for an underlying basis set; and
the flexiblity of the network yields extremely accurate results within a
variational quantum Monte Carlo framework that provides access to unbiased
estimates of arbitrary ground-state expectation values. We discuss how the
method can be extended to study other superfluids.

This paper presents a generalization of Murnaghan elastic material to
viscoelastic behavior using the Green-Rivlin multiple-integral approach. In the
linear limit, the model coincides with the generalized Maxwell model. To create
a nonlinear generalization, all possible second-order corrections were included
in the constitutive equations written in the internal strains representation.
Using this approach, we obtained expressions for the time- and
frequency-dependent nonlinear dynamic moduli. We applied the developed
nonlinear viscoelastic model to the description of infinitesimal strain waves
superposed on finite prestrain. Furthermore, we considered the generation of
higher harmonic by the nonlinear interaction of two strain waves, which we
showed can provide a method to measure all viscoelastic constants of the
developed model.

We consider theoretically the physics of bulk topological superconductivity
accompanied by boundary non-Abelian Majorana zero modes in
semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) hybrid systems consisting of finite wires
in the presence of correlated disorder arising from random charged impurities.
We find the system to manifest a highly complex behavior due to the subtle
interplay between finite wire length and finite disorder, leading to copious
low-energy in-gap states throughout the wire and considerably complicating the
interpretation of tunneling spectroscopic transport measurements used
extensively to search for Majorana modes. The presence of disorder-induced
low-energy states may lead to the non-existence of end Majorana zero modes even
when tunneling spectroscopy manifests zero bias conductance peaks in local
tunneling and signatures of bulk gap closing/reopening in the nonlocal
transport. In short wires within the intermediate disorder regime, apparent
topology may manifest in small ranges ("patches") of parameter values, which
may or may not survive the long wire limit depending on various details.
Because of the dominance of disorder-induced in-gap states, the system may even
occasionally have an appropriate topological invariant without manifesting
isolated end Majorana zero modes. We discuss our findings in the context of a
recent breakthrough experiment from Microsoft reporting the simultaneous
observations of zero bias conductance peaks in local tunneling and gap opening
in nonlocal transport within small patches of parameter space. Based on our
analysis, we believe that the disorder strength to SC gap ratio must decrease
further for the definitive realization of non-Abelian Majorana zero modes in
SM-SC devices.

We study the topological properties of interacting and non-interacting bosons
loaded in the orbital angular momentum states $l=1$ in a lattice of rings with
alternating distances. At the single-particle level, the two circulation states
within each site lead to two decoupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices with
correlated topological phases. We characterize the topological configuration of
these lattices in terms of the alternating distances, as well as their
single-particle spectrum and topologically protected edge states. Secondly, we
add on-site interactions for the two-boson case, which lead to the appearance
of multiple bound states and edge bound states. We investigate the doublon
bands in terms of a strong-link model and we analyze the resulting subspaces
using perturbation theory in the limit of strong interactions. All analytical
results are benchmarked against exact diagonalization simulations.

<h3>Flux fractionalization transition in two-dimensional dimer-loop models</h3>

<br>
<br>
The fully-packed O(1) loop model on square and honeycomb lattices is
critical, as is the fully-packed dimer model on these lattices. We introduce a
model of fully-packed dimers and loops with a relative fugacity $w$ that
interpolates between the fully-packed O(1) loop model ($w=0$) and the
fully-packed dimer model ($w=\infty$). We demonstrate that these two limits are
separated by a transition at a nonzero critical fugacity $w_c$. The $w<w_c$
phase has long loops and a power-law distribution of loop sizes, while a
short-loop phase is established for $w>w_c$. Away from $w_c$, both phases are
described by a long-wavelength Gaussian effective action for a scalar height
field that represents the coarse-grained electrostatic potential of fluctuating
dipoles. For periodic boundary conditions, the net electric flux that crosses a
cut along any periodic direction takes on all half-integer values for $w<w_c$,
while only integer values arise in the thermodynamic limit for $w>w_c$.
Power-law columnar order, present in the $w>w_c$ short-loop phase, is destroyed
by the proliferation of fractional fluxes in the long-loop phase. We argue that
this dimer-loop model describes the low temperature properties of spin $S=1$
antiferromagnets with exchange and easy-axis anisotropy on the planar
pyrochlore and kagome lattices in certain regimes of magnetic field and
anisotropy. We also construct a Rokhsar-Kivelson type Hamiltonian whose ground
state properties are controlled by this dimer-loop model.

<br>
<br>
The exceptional optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites (MHPs)
are presumed to arise, at least in part, from the peculiar interplay between
the inorganic metal-halide sublattice and the atomic or molecular cations
enclosed in the cage voids. The latter can exhibit a roto-translative dynamics,
which is shown here to be at the origin of the structural behavior of MHPs as a
function of temperature, pressure and composition. The application of high
hydrostatic pressure allows for unraveling the nature of the interaction
between both sublattices, characterized by the simultaneous action of hydrogen
bonding and steric hindrance. In particular, we find that under the conditions
of unleashed cation dynamics, the key factor that determines the structural
stability of MHPs is the repulsive steric interaction rather than hydrogen
bonding. Taking as example the results from pressure and temperature-dependent
photoluminescence and Raman experiments on MAPbBr$_3$ but also considering the
pertinent MHP literature, we provide a general picture about the relationship
between the crystal structure and the presence or absence of cationic dynamic
disorder. The reason for the structural sequences observed in MHPs with
increasing temperature, pressure, A-site cation size or decreasing halide ionic
radius is found principally in the strengthening of the dynamic steric
interaction with the increase of the dynamic disorder. In this way, we have
deepened our fundamental understanding of MHPs; knowledge that could be coined
to improve performance in future optoelectronic devices based on this promising
class of semiconductors.

Sb thin films have attracted wide interests due to their tunable band
structure, topological phases, and remarkable electronic properties. We
successfully grow epitaxial Sb thin films on a closely lattice-matched
GaSb(001) surface by molecular beam epitaxy. We find a novel anisotropic
directional dependence of their structural, morphological, and electronic
properties. The origin of the anisotropic features is elucidated using
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The growth
regime of crystalline and amorphous Sb thin films was determined by mapping the
surface reconstruction phase diagram of the GaSb(001) surface under Sb$_2$
flux, with confirmation of structural characterizations. Crystalline Sb thin
films show a rhombohedral crystal structure along the rhombohedral (104)
surface orientation parallel to the cubic (001) surface orientation of the GaSb
substrate. At this coherent interface, Sb atoms are aligned with the GaSb
lattice along the [1-10] crystallographic direction but are not aligned well
along the [110] crystallographic direction, which results in anisotropic
features in reflection high-energy electron diffraction patterns, surface
morphology, and transport properties. Our DFT calculations show that the
anisotropic features originate from the GaSb surface, where Sb atoms align with
the Ga and Sb atoms on the reconstructed surface. The formation energy
calculations confirm that the stability of the experimentally observed
structures. Our results provide optimal film growth conditions for further
studies of novel properties of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ thin films with similar lattice
parameters and an identical crystal structure as well as functional
