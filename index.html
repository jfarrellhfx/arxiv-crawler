<h3>A new synthesis approach to enhance electron mobility in epitaxial  La:BaSnO$_\text{3}$/SrZrO$_\text{3}$ heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12323</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We report a new synthetic route to achieve high electron mobility at room
temperature in epitaxial La:BaSnO$_3$/SrZrO$_3$ heterostructures.
Room-temperature mobilities of 157, 145, and 143 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ are
achieved for heterostructures grown on DyScO$_3$ (110), MgO (001), and
TbScO$_3$ (110) crystalline substrates, respectively. This is realized by first
employing pulsed laser deposition to grow at very high temperature the
SrZrO$_3$ buffer layer to reduce dislocation density in the active layer, then
followed by the epitaxial growth of an overlaying La:BaSnO$_3$ active layer by
molecular beam epitaxy. Structural properties of these heterostructures are
investigated, and the extracted upper limit of threading dislocations is well
below $1.0\times 10^{10}$cm$^{-2}$ for buffered films on DyScO$_3$, MgO, and
TbScO$_3$ substrates. The present results provide a promising route towards
achieving high mobility in buffered La:BaSnO$_3$ films prepared on most, if not
all, oxide substrates with large compressive or tensile lattice mismatches to
the film.

<h3>Optimal reaction coordinates and kinetic rates from the projected  dynamics of transition paths</h3>

<br>
Finding optimal reaction coordinates and predicting accurate kinetic rates
for activated processes are two of the foremost challenges of molecular
simulations. We introduce an algorithm that tackles the two problems at once:
starting from a limited number of reactive molecular dynamics trajectories
(transition paths), we automatically generate with a Monte Carlo approach a
sequence of different reaction coordinates that progressively reduce the
kinetic rate of their projected effective dynamics. Based on a variational
principle, the minimal rate accurately approximates the exact one, and it
corresponds to the optimal reaction coordinate. After benchmarking the method
on an analytic double-well system, we apply it to complex atomistic systems:
the interaction of carbon nanoparticles of different sizes in water.

<br>
Correlating the microstructure of an energy conversion device to its
performance is often a complex exercise, notably in solid oxide fuel cell
(SOFC) research. SOFCs combine multiple materials and interfaces that evolve in
time due to high operating temperatures and reactive atmospheres. We
demonstrate here that operando environmental transmission electron microscopy
can simplify the identification of structure-property links in such systems. By
contacting a cathode-electrolyte-anode cell to a heating and biasing
microelectromechanical system in a single-chamber configuration, a direct
correlation is found between the environmental conditions (O2 and H2 partial
pressures, temperature), the cell voltage, and the microstructural evolution of
the fuel cell, down to the atomic scale. The results shed new insights into the
impact of the anode oxidation state and its morphology on the cell electrical
properties.

<h3>Work fluctuations for a harmonically confined Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck  Particle</h3>

<i>Massimiliano Semeraro, Giuseppe Gonnella, Antonio Suma, Marco Zamparo</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the active work fluctuations of an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
particle in the presence of a confining harmonic potential. We tackle the
problem analytically both for stationary and generic uncorrelated initial
states. Our results show that harmonic confinement can induce singularities in
the active work rate function, with linear stretches at large positive and
negative active work, at sufficiently large active and harmonic force
constants. These singularities originate from big jumps in the displacement and
in the active force, occurring at the initial or ending points of trajectories
and marking the relevance of boundary terms in this problem.

<h3>Dynamical localization and slow dynamics in quasiperiodically-driven  quantum systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12271</a>
<br>
<i>Vatsana Tiwari, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Auditya Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the role of a quasiperiodically driven electric field in a
one-dimensional disordered fermionic chain. In the clean non-interacting case,
we show the emergence of dynamical localization - a phenomenon previously known
to exist only for a perfect periodic drive. In contrast, in the presence of
disorder, where a periodic drive preserves Anderson localization, we show that
the quasiperiodic drive destroys it and leads to slow relaxation. Considering
the role of interactions, we uncover the phenomenon of quasiperiodic
driving-induced logarithmic relaxation, where a suitably tuned drive
(corresponding to dynamical localization in the clean, non-interacting limit)
slows down the dynamics even when the disorder is small enough for the system
to be in the ergodic phase. This is in sharp contrast to the fast relaxation
seen in the undriven model, as well as the absence of thermalization
(drive-induced MBL) exhibited by a periodically driven model.

<h3>Photo-assisted spin transport in double quantum dots with spin-orbit  interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12272" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12272</a>
<br>
<i>David Fernández-Fernández, Jordi Picó-Cortés, Sergio Vela Liñán, Gloria Platero</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of spin-orbit interaction on the intra- and
interdot particle dynamics of a double quantum dot under ac electric fields.
The former is modeled as an effective ac magnetic field that produces
electric-dipole spin resonance transitions, while the latter is introduced via
spin-flip tunneling amplitudes. We observe the appearance of non-trivial
spin-polarized dark states, arising from an ac-induced interference between
photo-assisted spin-conserving and spin-flip tunneling processes. These dark
states can be employed to precisely measure the spin-orbit coupling in quantum
dot systems. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between photo-assisted
transitions and spin-flip tunneling allows the system to operate as a highly
tunable spin filter. Finally, we investigate the operation of the system as a
resonant flopping-mode qubit for arbitrary ac voltage amplitudes, allowing for
high tunability and enhanced qubit control possibilities.

<h3>Machine Learning Microscopic Form of Nematic Order in twisted  double-bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12274" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12274</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Modern scanning probe techniques, like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),
provide access to a large amount of data encoding the underlying physics of
quantum matter. In this work, we analyze how convolutional neural networks
(CNN) can be employed to learn effective theoretical models from STM data on
correlated moir\'e superlattices. These engineered systems are particularly
well suited for this task as their enhanced lattice constant provides
unprecedented access to intra-unit-cell physics and their tunability allows for
high-dimensional data sets within a single sample. Using electronic nematic
order in twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG) as an example, we show that
including correlations between the local density of states (LDOS) at different
energies allows CNNs not only to learn the microscopic nematic order parameter,
but also to distinguish it from heterostrain. These results demonstrate that
neural networks constitute a powerful methodology for investigating the
microscopic details of correlated phenomena in moir\'e systems and beyond.

<h3>Slow Dynamics and Kohlrausch Relaxation in Isolated Disordered Many-Body  Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12275</a>
<br>
<i>Asmi Haldar</i>
<br>
<br>
The Kohlrausch(-Williams-Watts) law of stretched exponential relaxation has
been observed for more than a century and a half in diverse complex classical
systems. Here we show that this law describes relaxation quite generically in
closed (executing Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics), interacting disordered many-body
systems across a range of system sizes using interaction range and disorder
strength as primary tuning parameters. This we observe for both
time-independent and periodically driven (Floquet) systems. Finite-size
analysis indicates the persistence of this non-thermal relaxation regime in the
thermodynamic limit thus defining a distinct dynamical regime. This regime
exhibits a peak in the time-scale of the perceptible relaxation, upon crossing
over from weak to strong disorder. We provide a simple picture of this
behavior, which naturally accounts for its general occurrence. Formation of
spin-glass -- one of the possible mechanisms for stretched relaxation appears
incidental to the occurrence of Kohlrausch law in our context. Finally, we
provide a simple non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formulation for the dynamics of a
single spin embedded in the disordered chain. This provides an analytical
formula that captures not only the Kohlrausch relaxation of the disorder
averaged auto-correlation but also captures the largely diverse dynamics of an
arbitrary target spin in the system. Our work hence also provides a concrete
quantification of the ``pre-thermal slowness" in many-body disordered system.

<h3>Magnetotransport on quantum spin Hall edge coupled to bulk midgap states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12282" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12282</a>
<br>
<i>Youjian Chen, Wenjin Zhao, Elliott Runburg, David Cobden, D. A. Pesin</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider magnetotransport on a helical edge of a quantum spin Hall
insulator, in the presence of bulk midgap states ``side-coupled" to the edge.
In the presence of a magnetic field, the midgap levels are spin-split, and
hybridization of these levels with the itinerant edge states leads to
backscattering, and the ensuing increase in the resistance. We show that there
is a singular cusp-like contribution to the positive magnetoresistance stemming
from resonant midgap states weakly coupled to the edge. The singular behavior
persists for both coherent and incoherent edge transport regimes. We use the
developed theory to fit the experimental data for the magnetoresistance for
monolayer WTe$_2$ at liquid helium temperatures. The results of the fitting
suggest that the cusp-like behavior of the resistance in weak magnetic fields
observed in experiments on monolayer WTe$_2$ with long edge channels might
indeed be explained by hybridization of the helical edge states with spin-split
bulk midgap states. In particular, the dependence of the magnetoresistance on
the direction of the external magnetic field is well described by the
incoherent edge transport theory, at the same time being quite distinct from
the one expected for a magnetic-field-induced edge gap.

<h3>Flavor symmetry breaking in spin-orbit coupled bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12284" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12284</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Recent experimental discovery of flavor symmetry breaking metallic phases in
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene points to the strongly interacting nature of
electrons near the top (bottom) of its valence (conduction) bands.
Superconductivity was also observed in between these symmetry breaking phases
when the graphene bilayer is placed under a small in-plane magnetic field or in
close proximity to a monolayer WSe$_2$ substrate. Here we address the
correlated nature of the band edge electrons and obtain the quantum phase
diagram of their many-body ground states incorporating the effect of proximity
induced spin-orbit coupling. We find that in addition to the spin/valley flavor
polarized half and quarter metallic states, two types of intervalley coherent
phases emerge near the phase boundaries between the flavor polarized metals.
Both spin-orbit coupling and in-plane magnetic field disfavor the
spin-unpolarized valley coherent phase. Our findings suggest possible
competition between intervalley coherence and superconducting orders, arising
from the intriguing correlation effects in bilayer graphene in the presence of
spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Light-matter correlations in Quantum Floquet engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12290" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12290</a>
<br>
<i>Beatriz Pérez-González, Gloria Platero, Álvaro Gómez-León</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum Floquet engineering requires a proper gauge-invariant description of
light-matter interaction to correctly capture the physics of the system beyond
the strong-coupling regime. This means that such models typically involve a
highly non-linear dependence on the photonic operators which makes their
analysis and simulation complex. In this work, we provide a non-perturbative
truncation scheme for the light-matter Hamiltonian, which is valid for
arbitrary coupling strength. Within this framework, we investigate the crucial
role of light-matter correlations, which are absent in a classical Floquet
description. We find that, even in the high-frequency regime, they can
spontaneously break key symmetries for topological protection, and be detected
in the photonic spectral function. We exemplify our findings with the SSH
chain, and show that a topological phase transition can be induced by coupling
to a cavity and that the critical point can be predicted from the spectral
function.

<h3>Terahertz-driven Local Dipolar Correlation in a Quantum Paraelectric</h3>

Light-induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectrics is a new avenue of
achieving dynamic stabilization of hidden orders in quantum materials. In this
work, we explore the possibility of driving transient ferroelectric phase in
the quantum paraelectric KTaO$_3$ via intense THz excitation of the soft mode.
We observe a long-lived relaxation in the THz-driven second harmonic generation
signal (SHG) that lasts up to 20 ps at 10 K which may be attributed to
light-induced ferroelectricity. Through analyzing the THz-induced coherent
soft-mode oscillation and finding its hardening with fluence well described by
a single well potential, we demonstrate intense THz pulses up to 500 kV/cm
cannot drive a global ferroelectric phase in KTaO$_3$. Instead, we find the
unusual long-lived relaxation of SHG comes from a THz-driven moderate dipolar
correlation between the defect-induced local polar structures. We discuss the
impact of our findings on current investigations of the THz-induced
ferroelectric phase in quantum paraelectrics.

<h3>Giant supermagnonic Bloch point velocities by jet propulsion effect in  cylindrical ferromagnetic nanowires</h3>

Achieving high velocities of magnetic domain walls is a crucial factor for
their use as information carriers in modern nanoelectronic applications. In
nanomagnetism and spintronics, these velocities are often limited either by
internal domain wall instabilities, known as the Walker breakdown phenomenon,
or by spin wave emission, known as the magnonic regime. In the rigid domain
wall model, the maximum magnon velocity acts as an effective "speed of light",
providing a relativistic analogy for the domain wall speed limitation.
Cylindrical magnetic nanowires are an example of systems with the absence of
the Walker breakdown phenomenon. Here we demonstrate that in cylindrical
nanowires with high magnetization such as Iron, also the magnonic limit could
be outstandingly surpassed. Our numerical modelling shows the Bloch point
domain wall velocities as high as 14 km/s, well above the magnonic limit
estimated in the interval 1.7-2.0 km/s. The key ingredient is the conical shape
of the domain wall which elongates and breaks during the dynamics, leading to
domain wall acceleration due to the jet propulsion effect. This effect will be
very important for three-dimensional spintronic networks based on cylindrical
magnetic nanowires.

<h3>Anomalous delocalization of resonant states in graphene \& the vacancy  magnetic moment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12339</a>
<br>
<i>Mirko Leccese, Rocco Martinazzo</i>
<br>
<br>
Carbon atom vacancies in graphene give rise to a local magnetic moment of
$\sigma+\pi$ origin, whose magnitude is yet uncertain and debated. Partial
quenching of $\pi$ magnetism has been ubiquitously reported in periodic
$first-principles$ calculations, with magnetic moments scattered in the range
1.0 - 2.0 $\mu_{B}$, slowly converging to the lower or the upper end, depending
on how the diluted limit is approached. By contrast, (ensemble) density
functional theory calculations on cluster models neatly converge to the value
of $2$ $\mu_{B}$ when increasing the system size. This stunning discrepancy has
sparked an ongoing debate about the role of defect-defect interactions and
self-doping, and about the importance of the self-interaction-error in the
density-functional-theory description of the vacancy-induced states.
Here, we settle this puzzle by showing that the problem has a fundamental,
mono-electronic origin which is related to the special (periodic) arrangement
of defects that results when using the slab-supercell approach. Specifically,
we report the existence of resonant states that are $anomalously$ delocalized
over the lattice and that make the $\pi$ midgap band $unphysically$ dispersive,
hence prone to self-doping and quenching of the $\pi$ magnetism. Hybrid
functionals fix the problem by widening the gap between the spin-resolved $\pi$
midgap bands, without reducing their artificial widths. As a consequence, while
reconciling the magnetic moment with expectations, they predict a
spin-splitting which is one order of magnitude larger than found in
experiments.

<h3>Mobility exceeding 100,000 cm$^2$/Vs in modulation-doped shallow InAs  quantum wells coupled to epitaxial aluminum</h3>

<br>
<br>
The two-dimensional electron gas residing in shallow InAs quantum wells
coupled to epitaxial aluminum is a widely utilized platform for exploration of
topological superconductivity. Strong spin-orbit coupling, large effective
$g$-factor, and control over proximity-induced superconductivity are important
attributes. Disorder in shallow semiconductor structures plays a crucial role
for the stability of putative topological phases in hybrid structures. We
report on the transport properties of 2DEGs residing 10nm below the surface in
shallow InAs quantum wells in which mobility may exceed 100,000 cm$^2$/Vs at
2DEG density n$_{2DEG}$$\leq$1$\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ at low temperature.

<h3>Nonisothermal evaporation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12348</a>
<br>
<i>E. S. Benilov</i>
<br>
<br>
Evaporation of a liquid layer on a substrate is examined without the
often-used isothermality assumption -- i.e., temperature variations are
accounted for. Qualitative estimates show that nonisothermality makes the
evaporation rate depend on the conditions the substrate is maintained at. If it
is thermally insulated, evaporative cooling dramatically slows evaporation
down; the evaporation rate tends to zero with time and cannot be determined by
measuring the external parameters only. If, however, the substrate is
maintained at a fixed temperature, the heat flux coming from below sustains
evaporation at a finite rate -- deducible from the fluid's characteristics,
relative humidity, and the layer's depth (whose importance has not been
recognized before). The qualitative predictions are quantified using the
diffuse-interface model applied to a liquid evaporating into its own vapor.

Here we present YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ and EuV$_3$Sb$_4$, two new compounds exhibiting
slightly distorted vanadium-based kagome nets interleaved with zig-zag chains
of divalent Yb$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{2+}$ ions. Single crystal growth methods are
reported alongside magnetic, electronic, and thermodynamic measurements.
YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ is a nonmagnetic metal with no collective phase transitions
observed between 60mK and 300K. Conversely, EuV$_3$Sb$_4$ is a magnetic kagome
metal exhibiting easy-plane ferromagnetic-like order below $T_\text{C}$=32K
with signatures of noncollinearity under low field. Our discovery of
YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ and EuV$_3$Sb$_4$ demonstrate another direction for the discovery
and development of vanadium-based kagome metals while incorporating the
chemical and magnetic degrees of freedom offered by a rare-earth sublattice.

<br>
<br>
Understanding melting in metals is a hot topic of present research. This may
be accomplished by pumping the system with infrared (IR) laser radiation, and
probing it with hard X-rays produced by an X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL). In
this work we studied nanostructured polycrystalline thin films of platinum that
were illuminated by IR radiation of increasing fluences. We characterized the
structural response as well as the nucleation and propagation of the liquid
phase as a function of time delay between the IR pump and X-ray probe. We
observed partial melting of the samples for IR fluences higher than 200
mJ$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$. To fit the contribution of the liquid phase to the
scattering pattern in platinum we applied a model of liquid metal. The
two-temperature model simulations were performed to understand the solid-state
fraction of the sample heating process as a function of time delay and fluence.

<h3>Type-II magnetic domain contrasts caused by internal-magnetisation  induced electron scattering anisotropy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12374</a>
<br>
<i>Tomohito Tanaka, Kazuto Kawakami, Hisashi Mogi, Satoshi Arai</i>
<br>
<br>
Previous studies have shown that type-II magnetic domain contrasts are caused
by differences in the backscattering yields of magnetic domains of opposite
magnetisation. Imaging the magnetic domains when the magnetisation vectors in
the opposite-magnetisation domains are perpendicular to the tilt axis of the
specimen has been considered impossible, because of the lack of change in the
backscattering yields between the domains. However, we found that it is
possible to observe the type-II magnetic domain contrast even in cases where
the backscattering coefficients of the domains are the same. The contrast
arises from the electron-scattering anisotropy created because of the
deflection of the electron trajectories by the Lorentz force. We verify this by
distinguishing all four possible in-plane magnetisation vectors on a Fe-Si(100)
surface, using an electron backscatter diffraction detector as an arrya of
electron detectors. The change in contrast between the magnetic domains, with
respect to the location of a virtual electron detector, can provide information
on the directions of the magnetisation vectors. A method to suppress the
topographic contrast superimposed on the magnetic domain contrast is also
demonstrated.

<h3>Impact of the orbital current order on the superconducting properties of  the kagome superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12377" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12377</a>
<br>
<i>Hong-Min Jiang, Ming-Xun Liu, Shun-Li Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experimental evidences signalling the chiral charge order
in the vanadium-based kagome superconductors, we theoretically investigate the
impact of the chiral flux charge order over the experimental outcomes for the
normal and the SC properties. It is revealed that the spectral weight on the
Fermi surface (FS) is partially gaped by the chiral flux charge order with the
reservation of the spectral weight on the $M$ points and the midpoint between
the two adjacent $M$ points, resulting in the momentum-dependent energy gap
being consistent with the recent experimental observations. More importantly,
by considering the influence of the chiral flux charge order, we find that a
conventional fully gapped SC pairing state evolves into a nodal gap feature for
the spectral weight due to the spectral gap modulations on the FS. As a result,
the U-shaped density of states (DOS) deforms to the V-shaped one along with the
residual DOS near the Fermi energy. These results bear some resemblance to the
experimental observations, and may serve as a promising proposal to mediate the
divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes about the SC pairing
symmetry.

<h3>Spreading of foam on a substrate</h3>

Foam is an industrially important form of matter, commonly deployed to clean
objects and even our own skin, thanks to its ability to absorb oil and
particles into its interior. To clean a large area, a foam is spread over a
substrate, but the optimum conditions and mechanism have been unclear. Here, we
study how a foam is spread by a rigid plate on a substrate as a function of
spreading velocity, gap height, confinement length, amount of foam and
wettability of the substrate. Three distinguishable spreading patterns were
found: homogeneous spreading, non-spreading, and slender spreading. It is also
found that the dynamics and the mechanism of the spreading can be explained by
coupling among dewetting, anchoring, shear stress, viscous stress and yield
stress. It is a unique feature of foams, which is not observed in simple
liquids and then these findings are also critical for understanding the
mechanical response of other soft jamming systems such as cells and emulsions.

We show that high-harmonic generation (HHG) in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be
efficiently controlled using the Aharanov-Bohm (AB) effect. When a static
magnetic field (B) is applied along the tube, electronic wave functions acquire
complex phases along the circumferential direction (AB effect), which modifies
the band structure. In particular, when the magnetic field is applied to
metallic CNTs, which can be regarded as one-dimensional massless Dirac systems,
realistic values of B lead to a nonzero gap in the THz regime. We demonstrate
that such change from gapless to gapped Dirac systems drastically increases the
HHG intensity in the THz regime. In the gapless Dirac system, the velocity of
each electron never changes under the electric field, and thus there is no HHG.
On the other hand, the gap opening activates both the interband and itraband
currents, which strongly contribute to HHG. Our work demonstrates a unique way
to manipulate HHG in nanotubes by tuning electronic wave functions using the
magnetic field and the tube structure.

Constant potential method molecular dynamics simulation (CPM MD) enables the
accurate modelling of atomistic electrode charges when studying the
electrode-electrolyte interface at the nanoscale. Here we extend the
theoretical framework of CPM MD to the case in which the total charge of each
conductive electrode is controlled, instead of their potential differences. We
show that the resulting thermodynamic ensemble is distinct from that sampled in
with a fixed potential difference, but rigorously related as conjugate
ensembles. This theoretical correspondence, which we demonstrate using
simulations of an ionic liquid supercapacitor, underpins the success of recent
studies with fixed total charges on the electrodes. We show that equilibration
is usefully sped up in this ensemble and outline some potential applications of
these simulations in future.

<h3>Antiferromagnetism of CeCd$_{0.67}$As$_{2}$ existing deep inside the  narrow gap semiconducting state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12451" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12451</a>

<br>
<br>
Single crystals of $R$Cd$_{0.67}$As$_2$ ($R$ = La and Ce) have been
synthesized by high temperature ternary melt and their physical properties have
been explored by means of magnetization, specific heat, electrical resistivity,
Hall coefficient, and thermoelectric power measurements. $R$Cd$_{0.67}$As$_2$
compounds indicate a (structural) phase transition at high temperatures,
accompanied by a remarkable increase of the electrical resistivity with an
extremely low carrier concentration. CeCd$_{0.67}$As$_2$ exhibits a large
magnetic anisotropy and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order below $T_{N} = 4$~K.
Magnetic susceptibility curves, together with magnetization isotherms and
specific heat, are analyzed by the point charge model of crystalline electric
field (CEF). In the paramagnetic state, the observed magnetic properties can be
well explained by the CEF effects, implying that the 4$f$ moments remain
localized. Electrical resistivity measurements, together with Hall resistivity
and thermoelectric power, also suggest highly localized 4$f$ electrons, where
Kondo contributions are negligible. The low temperature physical properties
manifest strong magnetic field dependencies. For $H \perp c$, $T_{N}$ shifts to
lower temperature as magnetic field increases, and eventually disappears at
$H_{c} \sim 60$~ kOe. Inside the AFM state, three metamagnetic transitions are
clearly evidenced from the magnetization isotherms. The RKKY interaction may be
responsible for the AFM ordering in CeCd$_{0.67}$As$_2$, however it would have
to be mediated by extremely low charge carriers. Although the AFM ordering
temperature in CeCd$_{0.67}$As$_2$ can be continuously suppressed to zero, no
AFM quantum phase transition is expected due to the lack of conduction electron
clouds to screen the 4$f$ moments.

<br>
<br>
A new picture of both integer and fractional incompressible quantum Hall
fluids as fluids carrying a electric quadrupole is introduced. This clarifies
their geometric properties, and allows the commonly-used ingredient of
continuous rotational symmetry to be removed from their descriptions; it is
argued that such a symmetry has no place in a theory of electrons moving in a
crystalline background.

Magnetic imaging with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins in diamond is becoming an
established tool for studying nanoscale physics in condensed matter systems.
However, the optical access required for NV spin readout remains an important
hurdle for operation in challenging environments such as millikelvin cryostats
or biological systems. Here, we demonstrate a scanning-NV sensor consisting of
a diamond nanobeam that is optically coupled to a tapered optical fiber. This
nanobeam sensor combines a natural scanning-probe geometry with high-efficiency
through-fiber optical excitation and readout of the NV spins. We demonstrate
through-fiber optically interrogated electron spin resonance and
proof-of-principle magnetometry operation by imaging spin waves in an
yttrium-iron-garnet thin film. Our scanning-nanobeam sensor can be combined
with nanophotonic structuring to control the light-matter interaction strength,
and has potential for applications that benefit from all-fiber sensor access
such as millikelvin systems.

<br>
<br>
Granular material is often handled using silos with inserts in industrial
processes to prevent "rat-holing" and similar behaviour, optimise mixing
behaviour, and prevent segregation. We study the mass flow rate and the static
zones of granular silos using the $\mu(I)$ rheology in the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We also extend the $\mu(I)$ model to incorporate
pseudo-dilatancy and nonlocal fluidity. We find that insert shape has a
significant effect on flow rate and static material. We also find that the
effect of inserts on flow rate is not strongly affected by the extensions,
while the amount of static material is highly dependent on the interactions
between insert shape and extensions. Finally, we find that the effect on flow
rate varies with insert size, while the amount of static material is not
significantly affected by increasing insert size. These results could provide
important insights for optimising silo design.

<br>
<br>
The valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials promises routes toward
energy-efficient information storage with enticing prospects towards quantum
information processing. Current challenges in utilizing valley polarization are
symmetry conditions that require monolayer structures or specific material
engineering, non-resonant optical control to avoid energy dissipation, and the
ability to switch valley polarization at optical speed. We demonstrate
all-optical and non-resonant control over valley polarization using bulk
MoS$_2$, a centrosymmetric material with zero Berry curvature at the valleys.
Our universal method utilizes spin-angular momentum-shaped tri-foil optical
control pulses to switch the material's electronic topology to induce valley
polarization by transiently breaking time and space inversion symmetry through
a simple phase rotation. The dependence of the generation of the second
harmonic of an optical probe pulse on the phase rotation directly demonstrates
the efficacy of valley polarization. It shows that direct optical control over
the valley degree of freedom is not limited to monolayer structures. Instead,
it is possible for systems with an arbitrary number of layers and bulk
materials. Universal and non-resonant valley control at optical speeds unlocks
the possibility of engineering efficient, multi-material valleytronic devices
operating on quantum coherent timescales.

<h3>Effect of hydrostatic strain on the mechanical properties and  topological phase transition of bi-alkali pnictogen NaLi$_{2}$Bi</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12605</a>
<br>
<i>Seyed Mohammad bagher Malek Hosseini, Shahram Yalameha</i>
<br>
<br>
The bi-alkali pnictogens have attracted significant attention for
optoelectronic and photocathodic device applications. However, in most of the
compounds belonging to this family, there has been less effort put into
investigating the mechanical properties and topological phase transitions (TPT)
of the compounds. Here, in the framework of density functional theory, the
mechanical properties and topological phase transition of NaLi$_{2}$Bi under
hydrostatic pressures are investigated. Elastic constants and phonon
calculations have shown the mechanical and dynamical stability of this compound
under hydrostatic tension and compression. The analysis of the elastic
constants shows that the NaLi$_{2}$Bi in the equilibrium state is an auxetic
material with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.285, which changes to a material
with a positive Poisson's ratio under hydrostatic tension. Meanwhile, Poisson's
ratio and Pugh ratio indicate that this compound has brittle behavior and
maintains it under hydrostatic pressures. The calculated results of the band
structure within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (Tran-Blaha
modified Becke-Johnson exchange potential approximation (TB-mBJ)) show that
NaLi$_{2}$Bi is a nontrivial topological material (trivial topological
material). It was found that hydrostatic compression (tension) in the GGA
(TB-mBJ) approach leads to a transition from a nontrivial (trivial) to a
trivial (nontrivial) topological phase for this compound. Moreover, the
calculated Wannier charge centers confirm the TPT. Identifying the mechanisms
controlling the auxetic behavior and TPT of this compound offers a valuable
feature for designing and developing high-performance nanoscale
electromechanical and spintronic devices.

<br>
Motivated by the need for low electron dose transmission electron microscopy
imaging, we report the optimal frame dose (i.e. $e^-/A^{2}$) range for object
detection and segmentation tasks with neural networks. The MSD-net architecture
shows promising abilities over the industry standard U-net architecture in
generalising to frame doses below the range included in the training set, for
both simulated and experimental images. It also presents a heightened ability
to learn from lower dose images. The MSD-net displays mild visibility of a Au
nanoparticle at 20-30 $e^-/A^{2}$, and converges at 200 $e^-/A^{2}$ where a
full segmentation of the nanoparticle is achieved. Between 30 and 200
$e^-/A^{2}$ object detection applications are still possible. This work also
highlights the importance of modelling the modulation transfer function when
training with simulated images for applications on images acquired with
scintillator based detectors such as the Gatan Oneview camera. A parametric
form of the modulation transfer function is applied with varying ranges of
parameters, and the effects on low electron dose segmentation is presented.

<h3>Magnetic impurities on superconducting Pb surfaces</h3>

<i>Ming-Hung Wu, Emma Thill, Jacob Crosbie, Tom G. Saunderson, Martin Gradhand</i>
<br>
<br>
It has been predicted theoretically and found experimentally that magnetic
impurities induce localized bound states within the superconducting energy gap,
called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. Combining symmetry analysis with
experimental findings provides a convincing argument for the energy splitting
and distribution of the YSR peaks, but the full details of the electronic
structure remain elusive and simple models with point scatterers lack the full
orbital complexity required to meet this challenge. In this work we combine a
Greens function based first-principles method, which incorporates a
phenomenological parameterization of the superconducting state, with orbitally
complex impurity potentials to make material-specific predictions of realistic
systems. We study the effect of 3d transition elements on the superconducting
energy gap of a Pb (001) surface. Not only do we find a good agreement with
experiment, we also show that the energetic position, strength and orbital
composition of the YSR states depend strongly on the chemical makeup of the
impurity and its position with respect to the surface. Such quantitative
results cannot be derived from simplified models but require full material
specific calculations.

<h3>Dielectric tunability of magnetic properties in orthorhombic  ferromagnetic monolayer CrSBr</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12672" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12672</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Monolayer CrSBr is a recently discovered semiconducting spin-3/2 ferromagnet
with a Curie temperature around 146 K. Unlike many other known two-dimensional
(2D) magnets, CrSBr has an orthorhombic lattice, giving rise, for instance, to
spatial anisotropy of the magnetic excitations within the 2D plane. Theoretical
description of CrSBr within a spin Hamiltonian approach turns out to be
nontrivial due to the triaxial magnetic anisotropy as well as due to magnetic
dipolar interactions, comparable to spin-orbit effects in CrSBr. Here, we
employ a Green's function formalism combined with first-principles calculations
to systematically study the magnetic properties of monolayer CrSBr in different
regimes of surrounding dielectric screening. We find that the magnetic
anisotropy and thermodynamical properties of CrSBr depend significantly on the
Coulomb interaction and its external screening. In the free-standing limit, the
system turns out to be close to an easy-plane magnet, whose long-range ordering
is partially suppressed. On the contrary, in the regime of large external
screening, monolayer CrSBr behaves like an easy-axis ferromagnet with more
stable magnetic ordering. Despite being relatively large, the magnetic dipolar
interactions have only little effect on the magnetic properties. Our findings
suggests that 2D CrSBr is suitable platform for studying the effects of
substrate screening on magnetic ordering in low dimensions.

<h3>Integrable Quantum Circuits from the Star-Triangle Relation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The star-triangle relation plays an important role in the realm of exactly
solvable models, offering exact results for classical two-dimensional
statistical mechanical models. In this article, we construct integrable quantum
circuits using the star-triangle relation. Our construction relies on families
of mutually commuting two-parameter transfer matrices for statistical
mechanical models solved by the star-triangle relation, and differs from
previously known constructions based on Yang-Baxter integrable vertex models.
At special value of the spectral parameter, the transfer matrices are mapped
into integrable quantum circuits, for which infinite families of local
conserved charges can be derived. We demonstrate the construction by giving two
examples of circuits acting on a chain of $Q-$state qudits: $Q$-state Potts
circuits, whose integrability has been conjectured recently by Lotkov et al.,
and $\mathbb{Z}_Q$ circuits, which are novel to our knowledge. In the first
example, we present for $Q=3$ a connection to the Zamolodchikov-Fateev
19-vertex model.

<h3>Definition and Classification of Fermi Surface Anomalies</h3>

<br>

We propose that the Fermi surface anomaly of symmetry group $G$ in any
dimension is universally classified by $G$-symmetric interacting fermionic
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in $(0+1)$-dimensional spacetime.
The argument is based on the perspective that the gapless fermions on the Fermi
surface can be viewed as the topological boundary modes of Chern insulators in
the phase space (position-momentum space). Given the non-commutative nature of
the phase space coordinates, we show that the momentum space dimensions should
be counted as negative dimensions for SPT classification purposes. Therefore,
the classification of phase-space Chern insulators (or, more generally
fermionic SPT phases) always reduces to a $(0+1)$-dimensional problem, which
can then be answered by the cobordism approach. We provide concrete examples to
demonstrate the validity of our classification scheme, and make connections to
the recent development of Fermi surface symmetric mass generation.

along with their noise analysis. We also indicate some routes for multiplexing

The evolution of a complex multi-state system is often interpreted as a
continuous-time Markovian process. To model the relaxation dynamics of such
systems, we introduce an ensemble of random sparse matrices which can be used
as generators of Markovian evolution. The sparsity is controlled by a parameter
$\varphi$, which is the number of non-zero elements per row and column in the
generator matrix. Thus, a member of the ensemble is characterized by the
Laplacian of a directed regular graph with $D$ vertices (number of system
states) and $2 \varphi D$ edges with randomly distributed weights. We study the
effects of sparsity on the spectrum of the generator. Sparsity is shown to
close the large spectral gap that is characteristic of non-sparse random
generators. We show that the first moment of the eigenvalue distribution scales
as $\sim \varphi$, while its variance is $\sim \sqrt{\varphi}$. By using
extreme value theory, we demonstrate how the shape of the spectral edges is
determined by the tails of the corresponding weight distributions, and clarify
the behavior of the spectral gap as a function of $D$. Finally, we analyze
complex spacing ratio statistics of ultra-sparse generators, $\varphi =
\mathrm{const}$, and find that starting already at $\varphi \geqslant 2$,
spectra of the generators exhibit universal properties typical of Ginibre's
Orthogonal Ensemble.

A quantum integrable system slightly perturbed away from integrability is
typically expected to thermalize on timescales of order $\tau\sim
\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength. We here study
classes of perturbations that violate this scaling, and exhibit much longer
thermalization times $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2\ell}$ where $\ell>1$ is an integer.
Systems with these "weak integrability breaking" perturbations have an
extensive number of quasi-conserved quantities that commute with the perturbed
Hamiltonian up to corrections of order $\lambda^\ell$. We demonstrate a
systematic construction to obtain families of such weak perturbations of a
generic integrable model for arbitrary $\ell$. We then apply the construction
to various models, including the Heisenberg, XXZ, and XYZ chains, the Hubbard
model, models of spinless free fermions, and the quantum Ising chain. Our
analytical framework explains the previously observed evidence of weak
integrability breaking in the Heisenberg and XXZ chains under certain
perturbations.

<br>
<br>
We consider a coarse-grained polymer model in order to investigate the origin
of the energetic and entropic contributions to the modulus of elasticity $G(T)$
of rubber-like gels. From this simple model, we are able to compute an exact
expression for the free energy of the system, which allows us to evaluate a
stress-strain relationship that displays a non-trivial dependence on the
temperature $T$. We validate our approach through comparisons between the
theoretical results and the experimental data obtained for tetra-PEG hydrogels,
which indicate that, although simple, the present model works well to describe
the experiments. In contrast to the linear dependence predicted by the
traditional, i.e., purely entropic, models, our results suggest that the
general expression of the modulus of elasticity should be of the form $G(T)
\propto k_BT w(T)$, with $w(T)$ being a temperature-dependent correction factor
that could be related to the interaction between the chains in the network and
the solvent. Accordingly, the correction factor allows the expression found for
the elastic modulus to describe both rubber and rubber-like gel materials.

<h3>Nonlinear sigma models for monitored dynamics of free fermions</h3>

We derive field theory descriptions for measurement-induced phase transitions
in free fermion systems. We focus on a multi-flavor Majorana chain, undergoing
Hamiltonian evolution with continuous monitoring of local fermion parity
operators. Using the replica trick, we map the dynamics to the imaginary time
evolution of an effective spin chain, and use the number of flavors as a large
parameter for a controlled derivation of the effective field theory. This is a
nonlinear sigma model for an orthogonal $N\times N$ matrix, in the replica
limit $N\to 1$. (On a boundary of the phase diagram, another sigma model with
higher symmetry applies.) Together with known results for the
renormalization-group beta function, this derivation establishes the existence
of stable phases -- nontrivially entangled and disentangled respectively -- in
the physically-relevant replica limit $N\to 1$. In the nontrivial phase, an
asymptotically exact calculation shows that the bipartite entanglement entropy
for a system of size $L$ scales as $(\log L)^2$, in contrast to findings in
previously-studied models. Varying the relative strength of Hamiltonian
evolution and monitoring, as well as a dimerization parameter, the model's
phase diagram shows transitions out of the nontrivial phase, which we map to
vortex-unbinding transitions in the sigma model, and separate critical points
on the measurement-only axis. We highlight the close analogies as well as the
differences with the replica approach to Anderson transitions in disordered
systems.
