<h3>Emergent Spectral Form Factors in Sonic Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09134</a>

We study the spectral form factor (SFF) for hydrodynamic systems with a sound
pole, a large class including any fluid with momentum conservation and energy
conservation, or any extended system with spontaneously broken continuous
symmetry. We study such systems in a finite volume cavity and find that the
logarithm of the hydrodynamic enhancement is closely related to the spectral
form factor of a quantum particle moving in the selfsame cavity. Depending upon
the dimensionality and nature of the effective single-particle physics, we
exhibit a range of behaviors including an intricate resonance phenomenon,
emergent integrability in the SFF, and anomalously large fluctuations of the
SFF.

<h3>Observation of non-local impedance response in a passive electrical  circuit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09152" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09152</a>

In media with only short-ranged couplings and interactions, it is natural to
assume that physical responses must be local. Yet, we discover that this is not
necessarily true, even in a system as commonplace as an electric circuit array.
This work reports the experimental observation of non-local impedance response
in a designed circuit network consisting exclusively of passive elements such
as resistors, inductors and capacitors (RLC). Measurements reveal that the
removal of boundary connections dramatically affects the two-point impedance
between certain distant nodes, even in the absence of any amplification
mechanism for the voltage signal. This non local impedance response is distinct
from the reciprocal non-Hermitian skin effect, affecting only selected pairs of
nodes even as the circuit Laplacian exhibits universally broken spectral
bulk-boundary correspondence. Surprisingly, not only are component parasitic
resistances unable to erode the non-local response, but they in fact give rise
to novel loss-induced topological modes at sufficiently large system sizes,
constituting a new manifestation of the critical non-Hermitian skin effect. Our
findings chart a new route towards attaining non-local responses in photonic or
electrical metamaterials without involving non-linear, non-local, active or
amplificative elements.

<h3>Magnetostatic interaction between Bloch Point nanospheres</h3>

Three-dimensional topological textures have become a topic of intense
interest in recent years. Through analytical calculations, this work determines
the magnetostatic field produced by a Bloch Point (BP) singularity confined in
a magnetic nanosphere. It is observed that BPs hosted in a nanosphere generate
magnetic fields with quadrupolar nature. This finding is interesting because it
shows the possibility of obtaining quadrupole magnetic fields with just one
magnetic particle, unlike other propositions considering arrays of magnetic
elements to generate this kind of field. The obtained magnetostatic field
allows us to determine the interaction between two BPs as a function of the
relative orientation of their polarities and the distance between them. It is
shown that depending on the rotation of one BP related to the other, the
magnetostatic interaction varies in strength and character, being attractive or
repulsive. The obtained results reveal that the BP interaction has a complex
behavior beyond topological charge-mediated interaction.

<h3>Machine learning in nuclear materials research</h3>

Nuclear materials are often demanded to function for extended time in extreme
environments, including high radiation fluxes and transmutation, high
temperature and temperature gradients, stresses, and corrosive coolants. They
also have a wide range of microstructural and chemical makeup, with
multifaceted and often out-of-equilibrium interactions. Machine learning (ML)
is increasingly being used to tackle these complex time-dependent interactions
and aid researchers in developing models and making predictions, sometimes with
better accuracy than traditional modeling that focuses on one or two parameters
at a time. Conventional practices of acquiring new experimental data in nuclear
materials research are often slow and expensive, limiting the opportunity for
data-centric ML, but new methods are changing that paradigm. Here we review
high-throughput computational and experimental data approaches, especially
robotic experimentation and active learning that based on Gaussian process and
Bayesian optimization. We show ML examples in structural materials ( e.g.,
reactor pressure vessel (RPV) alloys and radiation detecting scintillating
materials) and highlight new techniques of high-throughput sample preparation
and characterizations, and automated radiation/environmental exposures and
real-time online diagnostics. This review suggests that ML models of material
constitutive relations in plasticity, damage, and even electronic and optical
responses to radiation are likely to become powerful tools as they develop.
Finally, we speculate on how the recent trends in artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning will soon make the utilization of ML techniques as
commonplace as the spreadsheet curve-fitting practices of today.

<h3>Polymer-Chain Configurations in Active and Passive Baths</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09246</a>
<br>
<i>Caleb J. Anderson, Guillaume Briand, Olivier Dauchot, Alberto Fernandez-Nieves</i>
<br>
<br>
The configurations taken by polymers embedded in out-of-equilibrium baths may
have broad effects in a variety of biological systems. As such, they have
attracted considerable interest, particularly in simulation studies. Here we
analyze the distribution of configurations taken by a passive flexible chain in
a bath of hard, self-propelled, vibrated disks and systematically compare it to
that of the same flexible chain in a bath of hard, thermal-like, vibrated
disks. We demonstrate experimentally that the mean length and mean radius of
gyration of both chains obey Flory's Law. However, the Kuhn length associated
with the number of correlated monomers is smaller in the case of the active
bath, corresponding to a higher effective temperature. Importantly, the active
bath does not just simply map on a hot equilibrium bath. Close examination of
the chains' configurations indicates a marked bias, with the chain in the
active bath more likely assuming configurations with a single prominent bend.

<h3>Heat transport in Weyl semimetals in the hydrodynamic regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09254</a>
<br>
<i>Yonatan Messica, Pavel M. Ostrovsky, Dmitri B. Gutman</i>
<br>
<br>
We study heat transport in a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal
symmetry in the hydrodynamic regime. At the neutrality point, the longitudinal
heat conductivity is governed by the momentum relaxation (elastic) time, while
longitudinal electric conductivity is controlled by the inelastic scattering
time. In the hydrodynamic regime this leads to a large longitudinal Lorenz
ratio. As the chemical potential is tuned away from the neutrality point, the
longitudinal Lorenz ratio decreases because of suppression of the heat
conductivity by the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect (thermopower) and the
open circuit heat conductivity are intertwined with the electric conductivity.
The magnitude of Seebeck tensor is parametrically enhanced, compared to the
non-interacting model, in a wide parameter range. While the longitudinal
component of Seebeck response decreases with increasing electric anomalous Hall
conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$, the transverse component depends on $\sigma_{xy}$
in a non-monotonous way. Via its effect on the Seebeck response, large
$\sigma_{xy}$ enhances the longitudinal Lorenz ratio at a finite chemical
potential. At the neutrality point, the transverse heat conductivity is
determined by the Wiedemann-Franz law. Increasing the distance from the
neutrality point, the transverse heat conductivity is enhanced by the
transverse Seebeck effect and follows its non-monotonous dependence on
$\sigma_{xy}$.

<h3>Weakly nonlinear dynamics of a chemically active particle near the  threshold for spontaneous motion. II. History-dependent motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09467</a>
<br>
<i>Gunnar G. Peng, Ory Schnitzer</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a reduced model for the slow unsteady dynamics of an isotropic
chemically active particle near the threshold for spontaneous motion. Building
on the steady theory developed in part I of this series, we match a weakly
nonlinear expansion valid on the particle scale with a leading-order
approximation in a larger-scale unsteady remote region, where the particle acts
as a moving point source of diffusing concentration. The resulting amplitude
equation for the velocity of the particle includes a term representing the
interaction of the particle with its own concentration wake in the remote
region, which can be expressed as a time integral over the history of the
particle motion, allowing efficient simulation and theoretical analysis of
fully three-dimensional unsteady problems. To illustrate how to use the model,
we study the effects of a weak force acting on the particle, including the
stability of the steady states and how the velocity vector realigns towards the
stable one, neither of which previous axisymmetric and steady models were able
to capture. This unsteady formulation could also be applied to most of the
other perturbation scenarios studied in part I as well as the dynamics of
interacting active particles.

<h3>Vesiculation mechanisms mediated by anisotropic proteins</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09490</a>

Endocytosis is an essential biological process for the trafficking of
macromolecules (cargo) and membrane proteins in cells. In yeast cells, this
involves the invagination of a tubular structure on the membrane and the
formation of endocytic vesicles. Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins holding a
crescent-shape are generally assumed to be the active player to squeeze the
tubular structure and pinch off the vesicle by forming a scaffold on the side
of the tubular membrane. Here we use the extended Helfrich model to
theoretically investigate how BAR proteins help drive the formation of vesicles
via generating anisotropic curvatures. Our results show that, within the
classical Helfrich model, increasing the spontaneous curvature at the side of a
tubular membrane is unable to reduce the tube radius to a critical size to
induce membrane fission. However, membranes coated with proteins that generate
anisotropic curvatures are prone to experience an hourglass-shaped necking or a
tube-shaped necking process, an important step leading to membrane fission and
vesicle formation. In addition, our study shows that depending on the type of
anisotropic curvatures generated by a protein, the force to maintain the
protein coated membrane at a tubular shape exhibits qualitatively different
relationship with the spontaneous curvature. This result provides an
experimental guidance to determine the type of anisotropic curvatures of a
protein.

<h3>Quantized charge polarization as a many-body invariant in (2+1)D  crystalline topological states and Hofstadter butterflies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09127" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09127</a>
<br>
<i>Yuxuan Zhang, Naren Manjunath, Gautam Nambiar, Maissam Barkeshli</i>
<br>
<br>
We show how to define a quantized many-body charge polarization
$\vec{\mathscr{P}}$ for (2+1)D topological phases of matter, even in the
presence of non-zero Chern number and magnetic field. For invertible
topological states, $\vec{\mathscr{P}}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_2$, or $\mathbb{Z}_1$ topological
invariant in the presence of $M = 2$, $3$, $4$, or $6$-fold rotational
symmetry, lattice (magnetic) translational symmetry, and charge conservation.
$\vec{\mathscr{P}}$ manifests in the bulk of the system as (i) a fractional
quantized contribution of $\vec{\mathscr{P}} \cdot \vec{b} \text{ mod 1}$ to
the charge bound to lattice disclinations and dislocations with Burgers vector
$\vec{b}$, (ii) a linear momentum for magnetic flux, and (iii) an oscillatory
system size dependent contribution to the effective 1d polarization on a
cylinder. We study $\vec{\mathscr{P}}$ in lattice models of spinless free
fermions in a magnetic field. We derive predictions from topological field
theory, which we match to numerical calculations for the effects (i)-(iii),
demonstrating that these can be used to extract $\vec{\mathscr{P}}$ from
microscopic models in an intrinsically many-body way. We show how, given a high
symmetry point $\text{o}$, there is a topological invariant, the discrete shift
$\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$, such that $\vec{\mathscr{P}}$ specifies the
dependence of $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$ on $\text{o}$. We derive colored
Hofstadter butterflies, corresponding to the quantized value of
$\vec{\mathscr{P}}$, which further refine the colored butterflies from the
Chern number and discrete shift.

<h3>Robust d-wave superconductivity from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard  model: possible route to high-temperature superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09143" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09143</a>
<br>
<i>Hao-Xin Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang, Hong Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
Increasing numerical studies showed that the simplest Hubbard model on the
square lattice with strong repulsion may not exhibit high-temperature
superconductivity (SC). It is desired to look for other possible microscopic
mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay
between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the
Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations.
Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between
strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce
robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generates effective antiferromagnetic
spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial
role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$,
we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda>\lambda_c$ with a moderate
critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to
understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new
route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both
strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.

<h3>Continuous Gated First-Passage Processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09164" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09164</a>
<br>

A first-passage process, as the name implies, is a process that completes
when it hits a certain target value for the first time. Oftentimes, however,
the completion relies on additional constraints that have to be simultaneously
satisfied. Such processes are then called gated first-passage processes.
Despite their ubiquity, and the importance of continuous processes, a unified
framework which allows their systematic study is missing. While the use of a
renewal approach has provided deep insight into the dynamics of gated reactions
in discrete space, a straight forward analogy in continuous space is not
possible due to the ill-defined nature of the first-return process in
continuous space. In this work, we carefully explain this pathology, its
implications, and its remedy. The formalism developed herein allows us to
obtain the full statistics of the gated first-passage time. Notably, our
general formalism extends beyond single-point targets. We first present a
formalism that accounts for interval targets. Then we show how one can obtain
the single-point target formalism as a limiting case of the interval target.
The other limit, of an infinite target, is the problem of threshold crossing,
which is a central theme in extremal statistics. In cases where the underlying
process is heavy-tailed, we provide the asymptotics of the gated process in
terms of the ungated one. Furthermore, our analysis of gated first-passage
processes beyond the single-point target case reveals the need for a refinement
of the definition of crypticity in gated process. Lastly, we demonstrate how
the 1-dimensional formalism can be utilized to obtain results in higher
dimensions via the mapping between a 1-dimensional diffusion in a logarithmic
potential and the Bessel process in any dimension. All of our findings are
corroborated on a wide set of examples.

<h3>Ground state degeneracy of the Ising cage-net model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09168" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09168</a>

<br>
<br>
The Ising cage-net model, first proposed in Phys. Rev. X 9, 021010 (2019), is
a representative type I fracton model with nontrivial non-abelian features. In
this paper, we calculate the ground state degeneracy of this model and find
that, even though it follows a similar coupled layer structure as the X-cube
model, the Ising cage-net model cannot be "foliated" in the same sense as
X-cube as defined in Phys. Rev. X 8, 031051 (2018). A more generalized notion
of "foliation'' is hence needed to understand the renormalization group
transformation of the Ising cage-net model. The calculation is done using an
operator algebra approach that we develop in this paper, and we demonstrate its
validity through a series of examples.

<h3>Magnetism and $T-x$ phase diagrams of Na and Ag substituted  EuCd$_2$As$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is an antiferromagnetic semimetal, that can host non-trivial
topological properties, depending upon its magnetic state and excitations.
Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of
Eu(Cd$_{1-x}$Ag$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ and Eu$_{1-y}$Na$_y$Cd$_2$As$_2$, and study the
evolution and nature of magnetic order with doping. Temperature-substitution
phase diagrams are constructed from the electrical resistance and magnetic
susceptibility data. We observe a splitting of the magnetic transition into two
different transitions, and the gradual increase in one of the transition
temperatures with Ag- and Na-substitution. The other transition remains more or
less independent of doping. We further show that a magnetic state with a net
ferromagnetic moment is stabilized by both Ag and Na doping and this can be
explained by considering the changes in band filling due to substitution as
suggested by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We thus show that
chemical substitution and the subsequent changes in band filling could be a
pathway to tune the magnetic ground state and to stabilize a ferromagnetic
phase in EuCd$_2$As$_2$.

<h3>Extracting the Dispersion of Periodic Lossless LC Circuits Using the  White Noise</h3>

The spectral energy density (SED) method is used to obtain the phonon
dispersion of solids in molecular dynamics tools, e.g., LAMMPS. We show how the
electric analog of the SED method is used to find the dispersion of periodic
lossless LC circuits. The application of this idea is three-fold: (1)
demonstrating how SED proves useful, should the analytic methods of calculating
dispersion of a circuit render difficult (due to nonlinearity or having many
elements), (2) teaching the concepts like Brillouin Zone, dispersion (or band
structure), zone folding, gap formation and avoided crossing to students of
physics and electrical engineering by highlighting the similarities of phonon
and periodic circuits, and (3) studying the thermal devices, e.g., heat
rectifiers using commercial circuit simulators.

<h3>Power-law decay of correlations after a global quench in the massive XXZ  chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09204" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09204</a>
<br>
<i>Flávia B. Ramos, Andrew Urichuk, Imke Schneider, Jesko Sirker</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the relaxation dynamics of equal-time correlations in the
antiferromagnetic phase of the XXZ spin-1/2 chain following a global quantum
quench of the anisotropy parameter. We focus, in particular, on the relaxation
dynamics starting from an initial N\'eel state. Using state-of-the-art
density-matrix renormalization group simulations, the exact solution of an
effective free-fermion model, and the quench-action approach within the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the late-time relaxation is
characterized by a power-law decay $\sim t^{-3/2}$ independent of anisotropy.
This is in contrast to the previously studied exponential decay of the
antiferromagnetic order parameter. Remarkably, the effective model describes
the numerical data extremely well even on a quantitative level if higher order
corrections to the leading asymptotic behavior are taken into account.

<h3>Asymmetric bistability of chiral particle orientation in viscous shear  flows</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chirality-induced effects are at the origin of bacterial rheotaxis and
particle drift in shear flows. Here we use 3D printed micro-particles
consisting of a spherical head and a helical tail of different pitch and
handedness. We investigate the chirality-induced reorientation dynamics using
microfluidics and observe asymmetric orientation bistability perpendicular to
the flow direction. We quantitatively explain our findings through a
theoretical model without adjustable parameters considering particle
elongation, chirality and head-heaviness, in very good agreement with
experiments.

<h3>Magnetic phases of the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice in two dimensions, a
fundamental model for frustrated electron physics, displays a wide variety of
phases and phase transitions. This work investigates the model using the ladder
dual fermion approximation which captures local correlations non-perturbatively
but approximates non-local correlations. We find metallic, one-dimensional
antiferromagnetic, non-collinear antiferromagnetic, square-lattice
antiferromagnetic, and spiral phases but no evidence of collinear
antiferromagnetic order in different parts of the phase diagram. Analyzing the
spin susceptibility in detail, we see both regions of agreement and of
discrepancy with previous work. The case of Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ is discussed in
detail.

<h3>Interacting models for twisted bilayer graphene: a quantum chemistry  approach</h3>

<br>
<br>
The nature of correlated states in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the
magic angle has received intense attention in recent years. We present a
numerical study of an interacting Bistritzer-MacDonald (IBM) model of TBG using
a suite of methods in quantum chemistry, including Hartree-Fock, coupled
cluster singles, doubles (CCSD), and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), as well as
a quantum chemistry formulation of the density matrix renormalization group
method (DMRG). Our treatment of TBG is agnostic to gauge choices, and hence we
present a new gauge-invariant formulation to detect the spontaneous symmetry
breaking in interacting models. To benchmark our approach, we focus on a
simplified spinless, valleyless IBM model. At integer filling ($\nu=0$), all
numerical methods agree in terms of energy and $C_{2z} \mathcal{T}$ symmetry
breaking. Additionally, as part of our benchmarking, we explore the impact of
different schemes for removing ``double-counting'' in the IBM model. Our
results at integer filling suggest that cross-validation of different IBM
models may be needed for future studies of the TBG system. After benchmarking
our approach at integer filling, we perform the first systematic study of the
IBM model near integer filling (for $|\nu|< 0.2$). In this regime, we find that
the ground state can be in a metallic and $C_{2z} \mathcal{T}$ symmetry
breaking phase. The ground state appears to have low entropy, and therefore can
be relatively well approximated by a single Slater determinant. Furthermore, we
observe many low entropy states with energies very close to the ground state
energy in the near integer filling regime.

<h3>Dark Field X-ray Microscopy Below Liquid-Helium Temperature: The Case of  NaMnO2</h3>

<br>
Dark field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) is an experimental technique employed to
investigate material properties by probing their 'mesoscale,' or microscale
structures, in a bulk-sensitive manner using hard X-rays at synchrotron
radiation sources. However, challenges remain when it comes to applications of
this technique to examine low-temperature phenomena in quantum materials, which
exhibit complex phase transitions at cryogenic temperatures. One such material
is NaMnO2, which hosts an antiferromagnetic transition at 45 K that is
suspected to coincide with local structural transitions from its majority
monoclinic phase to nanoscale triclinic domains. Direct observation of local
heterogeneities and this effect at low temperatures in NaMnO2 is an important
step in understanding this material, and serves as an ideal candidate study for
expanding the DFXM experimental design space. This paper details a foundational
high-resolution DFXM study, down to liquid-helium temperature and below,
conducted to explore phase transitions in NaMnO2. The outlined experiment
ushers in the evaluation of other functional materials at low temperatures
using this technique.

<h3>Emergence of large spin-charge interconversion at an oxidized Cu/W  interface</h3>

Spin-orbitronic devices can integrate memory and logic by exploiting
spin-charge interconversion (SCI), which is optimized by design and materials
selection. In these devices, such as the magnetoelectric spin-orbit (MESO)
logic, interfaces are crucial elements as they can prohibit or promote spin
flow in a device as well as possess spin-orbit coupling resulting in
interfacial SCI. Here, we study the origin of SCI in a Py/Cu/W lateral spin
valve and quantify its efficiency. An exhaustive characterization of the
interface between Cu and W electrodes uncovers the presence of an oxidized
layer (WO$_x$). We determine that the SCI occurs at the Cu/WO$_x$ interface
with a temperature-independent interfacial spin-loss conductance of $G_{||}
\approx$ 20 $\times$ 10$^{13} \Omega^{-1}m^{-2}$ and an interfacial spin-charge
conductivity $\sigma_{SC}=-$1610 $\Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$ at 10 K ($-$830
$\Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$ at 300 K). This corresponds to an efficiency given by the
inverse Edelstein length $\lambda_{IEE}=-$0.76 nm at 10 K ($-$0.4 nm at 300 K),
which is remarkably larger than in metal/metal and metal/oxide interfaces and
bulk heavy metals. The large SCI efficiency at such an oxidized interface is a
promising candidate for the magnetic readout in MESO logic devices.

Inspired by experimental observations related to electrolyte-gated
transistors (EGTs) where non-ideals behaviors are shown and not described by
just one theoretical model, we proposed a charge carriers transport model able
to describe the typical modes of operation profiles as well as some non-ideals
ones from electrolyte-gated field effect transistors (EGOFETs) and organic
electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Our analysis include the effect of 2D or
3D percolation transport (PT) and also the influence of a shallow exponential
traps distribution on the transport. Under these considerations, a non-constant
accumulation layer thickness along the channel can be formed. Such dependence
was included into our model in the effective mobility parameter dependent on
the accumulation thickness. The accumulation thickness can depict 2D or 3D PT
or even a transition between them. This transition can produce a non-ideal
profile between the linear and saturation regimes in the output curve, region
in which a protuberance/lump appears. Other analyzed phenomenon was the
non-linear behavior for low drain voltage range in the output curve, even when
considering an ohmic contact. According to this proposed model, this curve
behavior is attributed to the traps distribution profile into the semiconductor
and the very thin accumulation layer thickness close to the injection contact.
It was also possible to analyze the conditions when the linear field effect
mobility is higher or lower than the saturation one. Finally, EGOFET and OECT
experimental data were successfully fitted with this model showing its
versatility.

The flat band of edge states which occur in the simple tight-binding lattice
model of graphene with a zig-zag edge have long been conjectured to take up a
ferromagnetic configuration. In this work we demonstrate that, for a large
class of interaction Hamiltonians which can be added to the tight-binding
model, and at the first order in perturbation theory, the degeneracy of the
edge states is resolved in such a way that the ground state is in the maximal,
spin j = N/2 representation of the spin symmetry where N is the number of edge
states.

Metallic materials, especially steel, underpin transportation technologies.
High-manganese twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) austenitic steels exhibit
exceptional strength and ductility from twins, low-energy microstructural
defects that form during plastic loading. Their high-strength could help
light-weighting vehicles, and hence cut carbon emissions. TWIP steels are
however very sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement that causes dramatic losses of
ductility and toughness leading to catastrophic failure of engineering parts.
Here, we examine the atomic-scale chemistry and interaction of hydrogen with
twin boundaries in a model TWIP steel by using isotope-labelled atom probe
tomography, using tritium to avoid overlap with residual hydrogen. We reveal
co-segregation of tritium and, unexpectedly, oxygen to coherent twin
boundaries, and discuss their combined role in the embrittlement of these
promising steels.

<h3>On universal butterfly and antisymmetric magnetoresistances</h3>

<i>H.T. Wu, Tai Min, Z.X. Guo, X.R. Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Butterfly magnetoresistance (BMR) and antisymmetric magnetoresistance (ASMR)
are about a butterfly-cross curve and a curve with one peak and one valley when
a magnetic field is swept up and down along a fixed direction. Other than the
parallelogram-shaped magnetoresistance-curve (MR-curve) often observed in
magnetic memory devices, BMR and ASMR are two ubiquitous types of MR-curves
observed in diversified magnetic systems, including van der Waals materials,
strongly correlated systems, and traditional magnets. Here, we reveal the
general principles and the picture behind the BMR and the ASMR that do not
depend on the detailed mechanisms of magnetoresistance: 1) The systems exhibit
hysteresis loops, common for most magnetic materials with coercivities. 2) The
magnetoresistance of the magnetic structures in a large positive magnetic field
and in a large negative magnetic field is approximately the same. With the
generalized Ohm's law in magnetic materials, these principles explain why most
BMR appears in the longitudinal resistance measurements and is very rare in the
Hall resistance measurements. Simple toy models, in which the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governs magnetization, are used to demonstrate
the principles and explain the appearance and disappearance of BMR in various
experiments. Our finding provides a simple picture to understand
magnetoresistance-related experiments.

We use a model Hamiltonian to study critical phenomena in manganites. This
Hamiltonian includes long-range strain interactions, and a coupling between the
magnetic order parameter and the strain field. We perform a perturbative
renormalization group (RG) analysis and calculate the static critical
exponents, correct to the one-loop level. We compare our RG results with many
experiments on doped manganite critical systems. Our theory is in excellent
agreement with the experimental values for the critical exponents.

The dynamic critical behavior at the paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic (PM-AFM)
transition in manganites has recently been studied experimentally [Niermann et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 114}, 037204 (2015)]. We extend the Hamiltonian of
Paper I by incorporating an energy field, and study the corresponding Model C
of critical dynamics. We use the dynamic renormalization group (RG) approach
and calculate the dynamic critical exponents $z$, $\nu z$ and the line-width
exponent $\Delta$ to leading order in the small expansion parameters
$\epsilon=4-d+2\sigma$ and $\epsilon'=4-d$. Here, $d$ is the space dimension
and $\sigma$ is the long-range exponent. Using $\sigma$ as an adjustable
parameter, the theory gives us a good match to the experimentally available
static and dynamic critical exponents at the PM-AFM transition.

Minimum energy path (MEP) search is a vital but often very time-consuming
method to predict the transition states of versatile dynamic processes in
chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this study, we reveal that the
chemical bond lengths in the MEP structures, including those directly involved
in the dynamical processes, largely resemble those in the stable initial and
final states. Based on this discovery, we propose an adaptive semi-rigid body
approximation (ASRBA) to construct a physically reasonable initial guess for
the MEP structures, which can be further optimized by the nudged elastic band
method. Examination of several distinct dynamical processes in bulk, on crystal
surface, and through two-dimensional system show that the transition state
calculations based on the ASRBA results are robust and significantly faster
than those based on the popular linear interpolation and image-dependent pair
potential methods.

We consider manifolds of tunable all-band flat (ABF) lattices in dimensions d
= 1, 2, parametrized by a manifold angle parameter {\theta}. We study
localization properties of eigenstates in the presence of weak magnetic flux
disorder and weak spin-orbit disorder. We demonstrate that weakly disordered
ABF lattices are described by effective scale-free models where the disorder
strength is scaled out. For weak magnetic flux disorder we observe
sub-exponential localization at flatband energies in d = 1, which differs from
the usual Anderson localization. We also find diverging localisation length at
flatband energies for weak flux values in d = 2, however the character of the
eigenstates at these energies is less clear. For weak spin-orbit coupling
disorder in d = 2 we identify a tunable metal-insulator transition with
mobility edges. We also consider the case of mixed spin-orbit and diagonal
disorder and obtain the metal-insulator transition driven by the manifold
parameter {\theta}.

<i>Ojasvi Pal, Bashab Dey, Tarun Kanti Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
We study linear and second-order nonlinear (NL) transport properties of a
two-dimensional gapped semi-Dirac system with merging Dirac nodes in the
presence of a low magnetic field ($B$) using semiclassical Boltzmann transport
formalism. The resulting dispersion at the merging point exhibits semi-Dirac
behavior which is quadratic in the $x$-direction and linear in the
$y$-direction. We find that the combined effects of the intrinsic anisotropic
spectrum, Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment (OMM) lead to finite NL
conductivities in the system. We obtain exact analytical expressions of linear
and second-order NL conductivities which allow us to analyze their dependence
on Fermi energy and system gap parameter $\delta_0$. The topology of the Fermi
surface for $\delta_0>0$ changes from two disjoint Fermi contours to a single
one across a saddle point as the Fermi energy is increased. This feature is
reflected in the nature of obtained conductivities through a kink in their
variations with Fermi energy. We find that the geometric mean (ratio) of Drude
conductivities along the $x$ and $y$ directions is independent of $\delta_0$
for low (high) doping. Interestingly, we show that the ratio of the anomalous
velocity and Lorentz force-induced NL Hall conductivity to the NL anomalous
Hall conductivity is independent of $\delta_0$ and inversely related to Fermi
energy only. For current along the $x$-direction, the NL longitudinal and Hall
resistivities show $B$-linear and $B^0$ dependences respectively in the lowest
order of $B$. However, for current along the $y$-direction, the longitudinal NL
resistivity has no contribution in both zeroth and linear order of $B$ while
the NL Hall resistivity is $B$-linear. The anisotropy in the nature of
$B$-dependencies of the NL resistivities may be experimentally relevant
signatures of band geometric quantities and merging Dirac nodes in such
systems.

<h3>Phase transitions study of the liquid crystal DIO with a ferroelectric  nematic, a nematic and an intermediate phase and of mixtures with the  ferroelectric nematic compound RM734 by adiabatic scanning calorimetry</h3>

<br>
<br>
Adiabatic scanning calorimetry (ASC) is capable of providing simultaneously
the specific enthalpy h(T) and the specific heat capacity cp(T), and is an
important tool to determine the order of transitions and to render
high-resolution information on pretransitional thermal behavior. Here we report
on ASC results on the compound DIO and on mixtures with RM734. Both compounds
exhibit a low-temperature ferroelectric nematic phase (NF) and a
high-temperature paraelectric nematic (N). In DIO these two phases are
separated by an intermediate phase (Nx). Detailed data of h(T) and cp(T),
indicated that the intermediate phase was present in all mixtures over the
complete composition range, albeit with strongly decreasing temperature width
with decreasing mole fraction of DIO (xDIO). The xDIO dependence of the two
transitions could be well described by a quadratic function and both
transitions were weakly first order. The true latent heat of the Nx-N
transition of DIO was as low as 0.0075 +/- 0.0005 J/g and 0.23 +/- 0.03 J/g for
the NF-Nx transition, about twice the previously reported value of 0.115 J/g
for the NF-N transition in RM734. In the mixtures both transition latent heats
decrease gradually with decreasing xDIO. At all the Nx-N transitions
pretransition fluctuation effects are absent and these transitions are purely
but very weakly first order. As in RM734 the transition from the NF to the
higher temperature phase exhibits substantial pretransitional behaviour. Power
law analysis of cp(T) resulted in an effective critical exponent of 0.88 +/-
0.10 for DIO and this value decreased in mixtures with decreasing xDIO towards
0.50 +/- 0.05 reported for RM734. Ideal mixture analysis of the phase diagram
was consistent with ideal mixture behavior for the total transition enthalpy
change

<h3>Ab-initio insights into the pressure dependent physical properties and  possible high-Tc superconductivity in monoclinic and orthorhombic MgVH6</h3>

<br>
<br>
Here we have used the density functional theory (DFT) with the GGA-PBE
approximation to investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic, hardness,
thermal, superconductivity and optoelectronic properties under pressure for
monoclinic (P21/m) and orthorhombic (Pmn21) structures of MgVH6. We have
studied optical properties of P21/m phase at 0 GPa and Pmn21 phase at 100 GPa
only (considering phase stability). Both of the phases of MgVH6 are
thermodynamically stable. P21/m phase is mechanically stable but Pmn21 is
mechanically unstable in our calculations for the pressures considered.
Monoclinic (P21/m) is ductile in nature, on the other hand, orthorhombic
(Pmn21) is brittle in nature at 100 GPa and becomes ductile for pressures in
the range from 125 GPa to 200 GPa. Hardness calculations indicate superhard
character of orthorhombic (Pmn21) structure at 100 GPa. The melting temperature
of orthorhombic crystal is very high. This also agrees with the bulk modulus,
Debye temperature, and hardness calculations. We have calculated theoretically
the superconducting transition temperature Tc at different pressures only for
the orthorhombic (Pmn21) structure following a previous study. The estimated
values of transition temperatures are within 104.7 K to 26.1 K in the pressure
range from 100 GPa to 200 GPa. MgVH6, in both the structures, are elastically
and optically anisotropic.

Path integrals are a ubiquitous tool in theoretical physics. However, their
use is sometimes hindered by the lack of control on various manipulations -
such as performing a change of the integration path - one would like to carry
out in the light-hearted fashion that physicists enjoy. Similar issues arise in
the field of stochastic calculus, which we review to prepare the ground for a
proper construction of path integrals. At the level of path integration, and in
arbitrary space dimension, we not only report on existing Riemannian
geometry-based approaches that render path integrals amenable to the standard
rules of calculus, but also bring forth new routes, based on a fully
time-discretized approach, that achieve the same goal. We illustrate these
various definitions of path integration on simple examples such as the
diffusion of a particle on a sphere.

Metadynamics allow to efficiently sample probability landscapes with multiple
maxima, in conditions where transitions between them are rare. It was
formulated for sampling processes in detailed balance, with an underlying Gibbs
measure. Here, we generalize this procedure to transition pathways in arbitrary
dynamics, including irreversible and time-dependent ones. One key realization
is that every stochastic diffusion induces a gradient flow in path space,
namely for the gradient of its corresponding Onsager-Machlup functional. Using
this, we can apply metadynamics in path space for transition path sampling in
stochastic systems, including stochastic differential equations and stochastic
partial differential equations.

We study non-equilibrium transport through a superconducting flat-band
lattice in a two-terminal setup with the Schwinger-Keldysh method. We find that
quasiparticle transport is suppressed and coherent pair transport dominates.
For superconducting leads, the AC supercurrent overcomes the DC current which
relies on multiple Andreev reflections. With normal-normal and
normal-superconducting leads, the Andreev reflection and normal currents
vanish. Flat band superconductivity is thus promising not only for high
critical temperatures but also for suppressing unwanted quasiparticle
processes.

Recently, van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructures have received
increasing research attention in spintronics. However, the lack of
room-temperature magnetic order of vdW material has largely impedes its
development in practical spintronics devices. Inspired by the recently
discovered vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2, which has been shown to have magnetic
order above room temperature and sizable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, we
investigate the basic electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe3GaTe2
as well as tunneling magnetoresistance effect in magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs) with structure of Fe3GaTe2/Insulator/Fe3GaTe2 by using first-principles
calculations. It is found that Fe3GaTe2 with highly spin-polarized Fermi
surface ensures that such magnetic tunnel junctions may have prominent
tunneling magnetoresistance effect at room temperature even comparable to
existing conventional AlOx and MgO-based MTJs. Our results suggest that
Fe3GaTe2-based MTJs may be the promising candidate for realizing long-waiting
full magnetic vdW spintronic devices.

The subthreshold leakage current in transistors has become a critical
limiting factor for realizing ultra-low-power transistors. The leakage current
is predominantly dictated by the long thermal tail of the charge carriers. We
propose a solution to this problem by using narrow bandwidth semiconductors for
limiting the thermionic leakage current by filtering out the high energy
carriers. We specifically demonstrate this solution in transistors with
laterally confined monolayer MoSi2N4 with different passivation serving as
channel material. Remarkably, we find that the proposed narrow bandwidth
devices can achieve a large ON/OFF current ratio with an ultra-low-power supply
voltage of 0.1 V, even for devices with a 5 nm gate length. We also show that
several other materials share the unique electronic properties of narrow
bandwidth conduction and valance bands in the same series.

To assess the potential of polycrystalline MnBi as a transverse

Nernst effect (ANE) by means of the heat flux method. We prepared MnBi samples
by powder metallurgy; this technique allows the preparation of samples in
arbitrary shapes with the possibility to tailor their magnetic properties. In
the material exhibiting the highest remanent magnetization, we found a value of
the ANE thermopower of -1.1 $\mu$V/K at 1 T, after the compensation of the
ordinary Nernst effect from pure bismuth present inside the polycrystalline
sample. This value is comparable with those reported in the literature for
single crystals.

We propose an efficient numerical method to obtain local order parameter in

first estimate the magnitude of staggered magnetization for the $S=1/2$ XXZ
Heisenberg model on a square lattice in the whole range of the XXZ anisotropy
by density-matrix renormalization group technique. The validity of our method
is confirmed by comparing our results with the previous analytical and
numerical studies. Then, as further demonstration, we apply our method to
obtain the staggered magnetization for the higher-spin cases from $S=1$ to
$S=6$. The accuracy of the obtained results is validated using the series

<br>
<br>
By means of exact path-integral Monte-Carlo simulations we investigate the
magnetic behavior of repulsive two-component Bose mixtures as a function of the
interspecies coupling strength. At fixed temperature below the Bose-Einstein
transition we calculate the chemical potentials in the two components and the
dependence of the total free energy upon polarization in the mixture. We find
that the magnetic susceptibility and the conditions for phase separation are
not modified from the zero temperature case in contrast to predictions using
approximate theories. As a result, the intriguing scenario where ferromagnetism
can be induced by thermal effects appears to be ruled out. For the value of
interspecies coupling corresponding to experimentally relevant balanced
mixtures, we calculate the chemical potential and the contact parameters as a
function of temperature. In particular, the results for the interspecies
contact parameter shows a suppression of correlations at intermediate
temperatures due to Bose statistics.

The work deals with the fatigue lifetime estimation of Short Fiber Reinforced
Thermoplastics (SFRP), with a focus on conjugated effects of thermal aging. Two
materials containing 35% (V35) and 50% (V50) weight ratio of short glass fibers
were aged for 500h at 200{\textdegree}C in air and compared to the same
materials in a Dry-As-Molded (DAM) state. Monotonic and fatigue tests were
performed in samples machined out of injected plates and cut along three
different orientations to the injection one (0, 45, 90{\textdegree}) in order
to capture the anisotropy of the skin-core microstructure, classical in
injected SFRP. Monotonic tensile tests evidenced the stiffening and
embrittlement of the Polyamide matrix reported in the literature, nevertheless
with an acuity depending on the matrix ratio and fiber orientation.
Stress-controlled fatigue tests were performed at constant amplitude, frequency
(10Hz), temperature (200{\textdegree}C) and stress ratio R=0.1. The fatigue
curves of V35 are more affected by aging than those of the V50 material. The
combined results from the mean strain evolutions and SEM observations confirmed
that the initiation approach for fatigue lifetime estimation was still valid in
aged composites. Several fatigue criteria, among the most recently reported in
the literature, were evaluated from this database. The effect of aging on the
cyclic evolution of the different Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FIP) involved
in the criteria was analyzed preliminarily. For the present fatigue conditions,
the best criteria for unaged materials (i.e cyclic creep energy-based ones)
were shown to still be the best for aged materials. Finally, the ability to
predict fatigue lifetime for aged composites from the identification of the
fatigue criterion in the unaged state was evaluated.

We introduce a vibronic model for a family of cubic $d^1$ double perovskites
and establish on its basis their ground ordered states. The model incorporates
dynamic Jahn-Teller effect on the metal sites, magnetic exchange, and elastic
quadrupole interactions. A four-sublattice mean-field approach reveals rich
ordered phases emerging from the interplay of the magnetic and elastic
quadrupole interactions. The phase diagram exhibits domains of canted
ferromagnetic-antiquadrupole and antiferromagnetic-ferroquadrupole phases.
Moreover, above the magnetic transition from the canted ferromagnetic phase,
two quadrupole orders coexist. The present theory unvailes the physical origin
of the puzzling ordered phases experimentally proposed for a series of cubic
$5d^1$ double perovskites.

Many fascinating systems suffer from a severe (complex action) sign problem
preventing us from calculating them with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations.
One promising method to alleviate the sign problem is the transformation of the
integration domain towards Lefschetz Thimbles. Unfortunately, this suffers from
poor scaling originating in numerically integrating of flow equations and
evaluation of an induced Jacobian. In this proceedings we present a new
preliminary Neural Network architecture based on complex-valued affine coupling
layers. This network performs such a transformation efficiently, ultimately
allowing simulation of systems with a severe sign problem. We test this method
within the Hubbard Model at finite chemical potential, modelling strongly
correlated electrons on a spatial lattice of ions.

Real-time nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF) have been very successful to
simulate the dynamics of correlated many-particle systems far from equilibrium.
However, NEGF simulations are computationally expensive since the effort scales
cubically with the simulation duration. Recently we have introduced the G1--G2
scheme that allows for a dramatic reduction to time-linear scaling
[Schl\"unzen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020); Joost et al., Phys. Rev. B
101, 245101 (2020)]. Here we tackle another problem: the rapid growth of the
computational effort with the system size. In many situations where the system
of interest is coupled to a bath, to electric contacts or similar macroscopic
systems for which a microscopic resolution of the electronic properties is not
necessary, efficient simplifications are possible. This is achieved by the
introduction of an embedding selfenergy -- a concept that has been successful
in standard NEGF simulations. Here, we demonstrate how the embedding concept
can be introduced into the G1--G2 scheme, allowing us to drastically accelerate
NEGF embedding simulations. The approach is compatible with all advanced
selfenergies that can be represented by the G1--G2 scheme [as described in
Joost et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 165155 (2022)] and retains the memory-less
structure of the equations and their time linear scaling.

<h3>Quantum paraelectricity and structural phase transitions in strontium  titanate beyond density-functional theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate an approach for calculating the temperature-dependent
anharmonic properties of complex materials with beyond density-functional
theory accuracy and we apply it to strontium titanate, a propotypical quantum
paraelectric material with strongly anharmonic lattice dynamics. Specifically,
we employ machine-learned potentials in combination with the stochastic
self-consistent harmonic approximation method in order to fully capture quantum
and anharmonic effects. We investigate the cubic to tetragonal transition
characterized by the softening of the antiferrodistortive mode, and we show
that the paraelectric phase is stabilized by anharmonic quantum fluctuations.
We find that a quantitative description of the quantum paraelectric behavior
requires a higher-level treatment of electronic correlation effects via the
random phase approximation. This approach enables detailed studies of emergent
properties in strongly anharmonic materials beyond density-functional theory.

<h3>Mechanical configurable nanopatterning of polar topological states and  formation of post-skyrmion</h3>

<br>
The controllable phase transition and nanopatterning of topological states in
a ferroelectric system under external stimuli are critical for realizing the
potential applications in nanoelectronic devices such as logic, memory,
race-track, etc. Herein, using the phase-field simulations, we demonstrate the
mechanical manipulation of polar skyrmions in ferroelectric superlattices by
applying external local compressive stress through an atomic force microscopy
(AFM) tip. Different switching pathways are observed: under small to moderate
force (<1 uN), the skyrmions coalesce to form a long stripe; while increasing
the applied load (e.g., above 2 uN) leads to the suppression of spontaneous
polarization, forming a new metastable topological structure, namely the
post-skyrmion. It is constructed by attaching multiple merons onto a center
Bloch skyrmion, showing a topological charge of 1.5 (under 2 uN) or 2 (under 3
uN). We have further designed a mechanical nanopatterning process, where the
stripes can form a designed pattern by moving the AFM tip (write), which can
also be switched back to a full skyrmion state under an applied electric field
(erase). We believe this study will spur further interest in mechanical
manipulation and nanopatterning of polar topological phases through mechanical
forces.

We consider classical spin systems evolving in continuous time with
interactions given by a locally tree-like graph. Several approximate analysis
methods have earlier been reported based on the idea of Belief Propagation /

<h3>Thermodynamics of bidirectional associative memories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09694" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09694</a>
<br>
<i>Adriano Barra, Giovanni Catania, Aurélien Decelle, Beatriz Seoane</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we investigate the equilibrium properties of bidirectional
associative memories (BAMs). Introduced by Kosko in 1988 as a generalization of
the Hopfield model to a bipartite structure, the simplest architecture is
defined by two layers of neurons, with synaptic connections only between units
of different layers: even without internal connections within each layer,
information storage and retrieval are still possible through the reverberation
of neural activities passing from one layer to another. We characterize the
computational capabilities of a stochastic extension of this model in the
thermodynamic limit, by applying rigorous techniques from statistical physics.
A detailed picture of the phase diagram at the replica symmetric level is
provided, both at finite temperature and in the noiseless regime. An analytical
and numerical inspection of the transition curves (namely critical lines
splitting the various modes of operation of the machine) is carried out as the
control parameters - noise, load and asymmetry between the two layer sizes -
are tuned. In particular, with a finite asymmetry between the two layers, it is
shown how the BAM can store information more efficiently than the Hopfield
model by requiring less parameters to encode a fixed number of patterns.
Comparisons are made with numerical simulations of neural dynamics. Finally, a
low-load analysis is carried out to explain the retrieval mechanism in the BAM
by analogy with two interacting Hopfield models. A potential equivalence with
two coupled Restricted Boltmzann Machines is also discussed.

<h3>On the critical role of martensite hardening behavior in the paradox of  local and global ductility in dual-phase steels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09720" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09720</a>
<br>
<i>V. Rezazadeh, R. H. J. Peerlings, J. P. M. Hoefnagels, M. G. D. Geers</i>
<br>
<br>
Experimental findings in the literature reveal that DP steels with identical
strength and composition, but different microstructures, exhibit inconsistent
trends under either necking-controlled or damage-controlled ductility tests. A
special case of this phenomenon is referred to in the forming community as the
cut-edge failure or edge cracking issue of DP steels. It is observed that
globally ductile microstructures are prone to premature damage at cut edges
while a comparatively less ductile DP steel performs better under the locally
applied deformation at such edges. In this paper, a systematical statistical
study is conducted to analyse this paradox from a micromechanical point of
view. The obtained results qualitatively confirm the experimental observations
and allowed us to explain/rationalize them, as follows. To reach a higher
necking-controlled ductility, i.e. global ductility, the mechanical contrast
between ferrite and martensite must be increased. Since martensite reveals a
very high initial hardening and fast saturation, activation of martensite
plasticity will lead to early necking in the microstructure and should
therefore be avoided; a high mechanical phase contrast has this effect.
However, at the same time a higher mechanical phase contrast is detrimental for
the local ductility. More heterogeneity in the microstructure causes the
generation of higher local plastic strains and triaxial stresses which leads to
early damages. Therefore, in DP steel, increasing the global ductility may come
at the expense of decreasing local ductility, and vice versa. The martensite
hardening behavior is the main factor governing this phenomenon, and therefore
also constitutes the key to processing improved steels that combine the best of
both.

<h3>A universal law for the pattern evolution of fullerene-based sandwiches</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09725</a>

Fullerene-based sandwiches have emerged as new candidates for potential
applications of two-dimensional nanomaterials in electronics or energy storage.
Recently, experimentalists have observed the evolution of boundaries for
fullerene clusters sandwiched by two graphene layers, while vacuum space with
typical dimension of 30 {\AA} was found within the fullerene layer. Because the
pattern of the fullerene cluster impacts the physical properties of the
sandwiches, it is important to understand the mechanisms for their structural
transformations. In the present work, we find that the
graphene/fullerene/graphene sandwich structure transforms among three
configurations, depending on the fullerene to graphene area ratio. Molecular
dynamics simulations show that there are two critical values for the area
ratio. The fullerene pattern transforms from circular to rectangular at the
first critical area ratio of 1/{\pi}. The critical value of 1/{\pi} is
successfully derived by comparing the geometrical perimeter of the circular and
rectangular shapes for the fullerene cluster without any physical parameters.
At the second critical area ratio, the graphene layers surrounding the
fullerene cluster become separated due to the competition between the bending
energy and the cohesive energy. Based on the analytic model, the vacuum space
is predicted to be 34 {\AA}, which agrees quite well with the experimental
result. These findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms driving
structural transformation of fullerene-based sandwiches, which will enable the
selection of appropriate structures and materials to guide the design of future
electronic and energy storage applications.

The evaluation of synthetic micro-structure images is an emerging problem as
machine learning and materials science research have evolved together. Typical
state of the art methods in evaluating synthetic images from generative models
have relied on the Fr\'echet Inception Distance. However, this and other
similar methods, are limited in the materials domain due to both the unique
features that characterize physically accurate micro-structures and limited
dataset sizes. In this study we evaluate a variety of methods on scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images of graphene-reinforced polyurethane foams. The
primary objective of this paper is to report our findings with regards to the
shortcomings of existing methods so as to encourage the machine learning
community to consider enhancements in metrics for assessing quality of
synthetic images in the material science domain.

<h3>Anharmonicity reveals the tunability of the charge density wave orders  in monolayer VSe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
VSe$_2$ is a layered compound that has attracted great attention due to its
proximity to a ferromagnetic state that is quenched by the presence of a charge
density wave (CDW) phase. In the monolayer limit, unrelated experiments have
reported different CDW orders with transition temperatures in the range of 130
to 220 K, making this monolayer very controversial. Here we perform
first-principles non-perturbative anharmonic phonon calculations in monolayer
VSe$_2$ in order to estimate the CDW order and the corresponding transition
temperature. Our analysis solves previous experimental contradictions as we
reveal that monolayer VSe$_2$ develops two independent charge density wave
orders associated to $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{7}$ and $4 \times 4$ modulations
that compete as a function of strain. In fact, tiny variations of only 1.5% in
the lattice parameter are enough to stabilize one order or the other, which
underlines that the CDW order becomes substrate-dependent. The predicted CDW
temperature is strain-dependent and has a value of around 220 K, in good
agreement with experiments. Moreover, we analyze the impact of external
Lennard-Jones interactions on the CDW. We show that these can act together with
the anharmonicity to suppress the CDW orders. In the particular case of
monolayer VSe$_2$, this may give rise to the emergence of a ferromagnetic
order.

<h3>Universal scaling of Klein bottle entropy near conformal critical points</h3>

We show that the Klein bottle entropy [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 261603 (2017)]
for conformal field theories (CFTs) perturbed by a relevant operator is a
universal function of the dimensionless coupling constant. The universal
scaling of the Klein bottle entropy near criticality provides an efficient
approach to extract the scaling dimension of lattice operators via data
collapse. As paradigmatic examples, we validate the universal scaling of the
Klein bottle entropy for Ising and Z3 parafermion CFTs with various
perturbations using numerical simulation with continuous matrix product
operator approach.

<h3>An effective anisotropic visco-plastic model dedicated to high contrast  ductile laminated microstructures: Application to lath martensite  substructure</h3>

In particular types of layer- or lamellar-like microstructures such as
pearlite and lath martensite, plastic slip occurs favorably in directions
parallel to inter-lamellar boundaries. This may be due to the interplay between
morphology and crystallographic orientation or, more generally, due to
constraints imposed on the plastic slip due to the lamellar microstructural
geometry. This paper proposes a micromechanics based, computationally
efficient, scale independent model for particular type of lamellar
microstructures containing softer lamellae, which are sufficiently thin to be
considered as discrete slip planes embedded in a matrix representing the harder
lamellae. Accordingly, the model is constructed as an isotropic visco-plastic
model which is enriched with an additional orientation-dependent planar plastic
deformation mechanism. This additional mode is activated when the applied load,
projected on the direction of the soft films, induces a significant amount of
shear stress. Otherwise, the plastic deformation is governed solely by the
isotropic part of the model. The response of the proposed model is assessed via
a comparison to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an infinite periodic
two-phase laminate. It is shown that the yielding behavior of the model follows
the same behavior as the reference model. It is observed that the proposed
model is highly anisotropic, and the degree of anisotropy depends on the
contrast between the slip resistance (or yield stress) of the planar mode
versus that of the isotropic part. The formulation is then applied to model the
substructure of lath martensite with inter-layer thin austenite films. It is
exploited in a mesoscale simulation of a dual-phase (DP) steel
microstructure.The results are compared with those of a standard isotropic
model and a full crystal plasticity model.

We consider the resonant Fermi gas, that is, spin 1/2 fermions in three
dimensions interacting by a two-body short-range potential of large scattering
length. We introduce a quantity, the three-body contact, in terms of which we
express several observables: the number of nearby fermion triplets, the
large-momentum tail of the center-of-mass momentum distribution of nearby
fermion pairs, and the formation rate of deeply bound dimers by three-body
recombination.

We propose a scheme to implement Kitaev's honeycomb model with cold atoms,
based on a periodic (Floquet) drive, in view of realizing and probing
non-Abelian chiral spin liquids in quantum simulators. We derive the effective
Hamiltonian to leading order in the inverse-frequency expansion, and show that
the drive opens up a topological gap in the spectrum without mixing the
effective Majorana and vortex degrees of freedom. We address the challenge of
probing the physics of Majorana fermions while having only access to the
original composite spin degrees of freedom. Specifically, we propose to detect
the properties of the chiral spin liquid phase using gap spectroscopy and edge
quenches in the presence of the Floquet drive. The resulting chiral edge
signal, which relates to the thermal Hall effect associated with Majorana
fermions, is found to be robust for realistically-prepared states. By combining
strong interactions with Floquet engineering, our work paves the way for future
studies of non-Abelian excitations and quantized thermal transport using
quantum simulators.

<br>
Time-reversal symmetry breaking allows for a rich set of magneto-transport
properties related to electronic topology. Focusing on the magnetic Weyl
semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, we prepared micro-ribbons and investigated their
transverse and longitudinal transport properties from 100 K to 180 K in
magnetic fields $\mu_0 H$ up to 2T. We establish the presence of a
magnetoresistance (MR) up to 1 % with a strong anisotropy depending the
projection of $H$ on the easy-axis magnetization, which exceeds all other
magnetoresistive effects. Based on detailed phenomenological modeling, we
attribute the observed results with unexpected form of anisotropy to magnon MR
resulting from magnon-electron coupling. Moreover, a similar angular dependence
is also found in the transverse resistivity which we show to originate from the
combination of ordinary Hall and anomalous Hall effects. Thus the interplay of
magnetic and topological properties governs the magnetotransport features of
this magnetic Weyl system.

<h3>Are atomic insulators distinguishable?</h3>

<br>
Topological classification of quantum solids often (if not always) groups all
trivial atomic or normal insulators (NIs) into the same featureless family. As
we argue here, this is not necessarily the case always. In particular, when the
global phase diagram of electronic crystals harbors topological insulators with
the band inversion at various time reversal invariant momenta ${\bf K}^{\rm
TI}_{\rm inv}$ in the Brillouin zone, their proximal NIs display noninverted
band gap minima at ${\bf K}^{\rm NI}_{\rm min}={\bf K}^{\rm TI}_{\rm inv}$. In
such systems, once topological superconductors nucleate from NIs, the inversion
of the Bogoliubov de Gennes bands takes place at ${\bf K}^{\rm BdG}_{\rm
inv}={\bf K}^{\rm NI}_{\rm min}$, inheriting from the parent state. We showcase
this (possibly general) proposal for two-dimensional time reversal symmetry
breaking insulators. Then distinct quantized thermal Hall conductivity and
responses to dislocation lattice defects inside the paired states (tied with
${\bf K}^{\rm BdG}_{\rm inv}$ or ${\bf K}^{\rm NI}_{\rm min}$), in turn
unambiguously identify different parent atomic NIs.
