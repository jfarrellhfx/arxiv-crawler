<h3>Analytic thermodynamic properties of the Lieb-Liniger gas</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06092" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06092</a>
<br>
</p><i>M. L. Kerr, G. De Rosi, K. V. Kheruntsyan</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate
analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities
of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact
repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory
plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability
and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold
bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the
uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal
Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the
TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the
underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the
Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the
insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic
results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which
exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be
further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous
(e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density
approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories,
allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the
underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be
applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid
helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.

<h3>Canonical Temperature Control by Molecular Dynamics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05731" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05731</a>
<br>
</p><i>William Graham Hoover, Carol Griswold Hoover</i>
<p>"Pedagogical derivations for Nos\'e's dynamics can be developed in two
different ways, (i) by starting with a temperature-dependent Hamiltonian in
which the variable $s$ scales the time or the mass, or (ii) by requiring that
the equations of motion generate the canonical distribution including a
Gaussian distribution in the friction coefficient $\zeta$. Nos\'e's papers
follow the former approach. Because the latter approach is not only
constructive and simple, but also can be generalized to other forms of the
equations of motion, we illustrate it here. We begin by considering the
probability density $f(q,p,\zeta)$ in an extended phase space which includes
$\zeta$ as well as all pairs of phase variables $q$ and $p$. This density
$f(q,p,\zeta)$ satisfies the conservation of probability (Liouville's
Continuity Equation)" $$(\partial f/\partial t) + \sum (\partial (\dot q
f)/\partial q) + \sum (\partial (\dot p f)/\partial p) + \sum (\partial (\dot
\zeta f)/\partial \zeta) = 0 \ . $$ The multi-authored ``review''\cite{b1}
motivated our quoting the history of Nos\'e and Nos\'e-Hoover mechanics, aptly
described on page 31 of Bill's 1986 {\it Molecular Dynamics} book, reproduced

<h3>The Rosenzweig Porter model revisited for the three Wigner Dyson  symmetry classes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05755</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tilen Cadez, Dillip Nandy, Dario Rosa, Alexei Andreanov, Barbara Dietz</i>
<p>We present numerical results for the Rosenzweig Porter model for all symmetry
classes of the Dyson threefold way. We analyzed the fluctuation properties in
the eigenvalue spectra, and compared them with existing and new analytical
results. Based on these results we propose characteristics of the spectral
properties as measures to explore the transition from Poisson to Wigner Dyson
WD statistics. Furthermore, we performed thorough studies of the properties of
the eigenvectors in terms of the fractal dimensions, the Kullback Leibler KL
divergences and the fidelity susceptibility. The ergodic and Anderson
transitions take place at the same parameter values and a finite size scaling
analysis of the KL divergences at the transitions yields the same critical
exponents for all three WD classes, thus indicating superuniversality of these
transitions.

<h3>Direction of spontaneous processes in non-equilibrium systems with  movable/permeable internal walls</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05757</a>
<br>
</p><i>Robert Hołyst, Paweł Jan Żuk, Anna Maciołek, Karol Makuch, Konrad Giżyński</i>
<p>The second law of equilibrium thermodynamics explains the direction of
spontaneous processes in a system after removing internal constraints. When the
system only exchanges energy with the environment as heat, the second law
states that spontaneous processes at constant temperature satisfy: $\textrm{d}
U - \delta Q \leq 0$. Here, $\textrm{d} U$ is the infinitesimal change of the
internal energy, and $\delta Q$ is the infinitesimal heat exchanged in the
process. We will consider ideal gas, van der Waals gas, and a binary mixture of
ideal gases in a heat flow. We will divide each system into two subsystems by a
movable wall. We will show that the direction of the motion of the wall, after
release, at constant boundary conditions is determined by the same inequality
as in equilibrium thermodynamics. The only difference between equilibrium and
non-equilibrium is the dependence of the net heat change, $\delta Q$, on the
state parameters of the system. We will study the influence of the
gravitational field. The inequality determining the direction of motion of the
internal wall at constant boundary conditions is $\textrm{d} E - \delta Q -
\delta W_p \leq 0$, where $\textrm{d} E$ is the change of the total energy
(internal and gravitational), and $\delta W_p$ is the infinitesimal work
performed by gravity. We will also consider a wall thick and permeable to gas
particles and derive Archimedes' principle in the heat flow. Finally, we will
study the ideal gas's Couette flow, where the direction of the motion of the
internal wall follows from the inequality $\textrm{d} E - \delta Q - \delta W_s
\leq 0$, with $\textrm{d} E$ being the infinitesimal change of the total energy
(internal and kinetic) and $\delta W_s$ the infinitesimal work exchanged with
the environment due to shear force. Ultimately, we will synthesize all these
cases in a framework of the second law of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

<h3>Kagome Hubbard model away from the strong coupling limit: Flat band  localization and non Fermi liquid signatures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05787</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shashikant Singh Kunwar, Madhuparna Karmakar</i>
<p>Taking cue from the recent experimental realization of metallic phases in
Kagome materials we report the low temperature signatures and thermal scales of
Kagome metals and insulators, determined in the framework of the Kagome Hubbard
model, using a non perturbative numerical approach. In contrast to the existing
consensus we establish a flat band localized insulator in the weak coupling
regime which crosses over to a non Fermi liquid (NFL) metal at intermediate
coupling, followed by a first order metal-Mott insulator transition in the
strong coupling regime. We provide the first accurate estimates of the thermal
scales of this model and analyze the NFL phases in terms of resilient
quasiparticles and short range magnetic correlations. With our unprecedented
access to the low temperature phases and sufficiently large system sizes, we
provide the essential benchmarks for the prospective experiments on the Kagome
metal and insulators in terms of their thermodynamic, spectroscopic and
transport signatures.

<h3>Electrical control of superconducting spin valves using ferromagnetic  helices</h3>

</p><i>Tancredi Salamone, Henning G. Hugdal, Morten Amundsen, Sol H. Jacobsen</i>
<p>The geometrical properties of a helical ferromagnet are shown theoretically
to control the critical temperature of a proximity-coupled superconductor.
Using the Usadel equation for diffusive spin transport, we provide
self-consistent analysis of how curvature and torsion modulate the proximity
effect. When the helix is attached to a piezoelectric actuator, the pitch of
the helix -- and hence the superconducting transition -- can be controlled

<h3>Quantum Spin Liquids in Weak Mott Insulators with a Spin-Orbit Coupling</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05806" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05806</a>
<br>
</p><i>Asimpunya Mitra, Daniel J. Schultz, Yong Baek Kim</i>
<p>The weak Mott insulating regime of the triangular lattice Hubbard model
exhibits a rich magnetic phase diagram as a result of the ring exchange
interaction in the spin Hamiltonian. These phases include the Kalmeyer-Laughlin
type chiral spin liquid (CSL) and a valence bond solid (VBS). A natural
question arises regarding the robustness of these phases in the presence of a
weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In this study, we derive the effective spin
model for the spin-orbit coupled triangular lattice Hubbard model in the weak
Mott insulting regime, including all SOC-mediated spin-bilinears and
ring-exchange interactions. We then construct a simplified spin model keeping
only the most relevant SOC-mediated spin interactions. Using infinite density
matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) we show that the CSL and VBS phases of the
triangular lattice Hubbard model can be stabilized in the presence of a weak
SOC. The stabilization results from a compensation between the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a SOC-mediated ring exchange interaction.
We also provide additional qualitative arguments to intuitively understand the
compensation mechanism in the iDMRG quantum phase diagrams. This mechanism for
stabilization can potentially be useful for the experimental realization of
quantum spin liquids.

<h3>Fluoride Frameworks as Potential Calcium Battery Cathodes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05820" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05820</a>
<br>
</p><i>Dereje Bekele Tekliye, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam</i>
<p>Calcium batteries (CBs) are potential next-generation energy storage devices,
offering a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to their
theoretically high energy density, better safety, and lower costs associated
with the natural abundance of calcium. However, the limited availability of
positive electrode (cathode) materials has constrained the development of CBs
so far. Given the similar ionic radii of Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$, structures that
are effective at reversibly intercalating Na$^+$ may be able to reversibly
intercalate Ca$^{2+}$ as well. In this context, transition metal fluorides
(TMFs) exhibiting weberite and perovskite structures that are known for
intercalating Na$^+$ form an interesting set of possible CB cathode frameworks.
Thus, we use first principles calculations to explore weberite and perovskite
TMFs as CB cathodes, of compositions
Ca\textsubscript{x}M\textsubscript{2}F\textsubscript{7} and
Ca\textsubscrpt{x}MF\textsubscript{3}, respectively, where M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, or Ni. We systematically evaluate key cathode properties, including
ground state structure, average Ca-intercalation voltage, thermodynamic
stability (at 0 K), theoretical capacity, and Ca$^{2+}$ migration barriers.
Importantly, we identify
Ca\textsubscript{x}Cr\textsubscript{2}F\textsubscript{7} and
Ca\textsubscript{x}Mn\textsubscript{2}F\textsubscript{7} weberite frameworks as
promising Ca-cathodes. Our study not only unveils potential CB cathodes but
also paves the way for further advancement in TMF-based intercalation cathodes,
diversifying the chemical space for next-generation energy storage systems.

<h3>Spin high-harmonic generation through terahertz laser-driven phonons</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05830" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05830</a>
<br>
</p><i>Negin Moharrami Allafi, Michael H. Kolodrubetz, Marin Bukov, Vadim Oganesyan, Mohsen Yarmohammadi</i>
<p>In the realm of open quantum systems, steady states and high-harmonic
generation (HHG) existing far from equilibrium have become core pillars of
ultrafast science. Most solid-state research explores charge HHG with limited
investigations into spin degrees of freedom. In this study, we theoretically
address spin HHG in the steady state resulting from the terahertz laser-driven
spin-phonon coupling in a dissipative dimerized spin-1/2 chain. Instead of
directly driving spins using time-dependent magnetic fields, we employ the
magnetophononic mechanism, where the laser first drives the lattice, and then
the excited lattice subsequently drives the spins. We investigate the role of
various model parameters for optimizing HHG. Increasing the laser's amplitude
amplifies spin HHG beyond the perturbative regime, enhancing both harmonic
amplitudes and orders. We find that configuring the drive frequency far below
the spin band yields the highest harmonic order. Additionally, we provide a
theory matching the numerical results under weak spin-phonon coupling and
propose an experimental procedure to probe the emission spectrum of spin HHG.

<h3>Self-Trapped Excitons in Metal-Halide Perovskites Investigated by  Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05837" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05837</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yu Jin, Mariami Rusishvili, Marco Govoni, Giulia Galli</i>
<p>We present a theoretical study of the formation of self-trapped excitons
(STEs) and the associated broadband emission in metal-halide perovskites
Cs$_4$SnBr$_6$ and Cs$_2$AgInCl$_6$, using time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT) with the dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) functional. Our
approach allows for an accurate description of the excitonic effect and
geometry relaxation in the electronic excited states and yields optical gap,
STE emission energy, and emission spectra in reasonable agreement with
experiments. We point out the significance of considering geometry relaxations
in the electronic excited state by showing that the exciton-phonon coupling
computed in the ground-state atomic geometry is insufficient to describe the
physical properties of STEs. Overall, we find that TDDFT with the DDH hybrid
functional is a suitable approach for the study of the formation of STEs in
perovskite and provides insights for designing metal-halide perovskites with
tailored emission properties.

<h3>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered  antiferromagnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05845" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05845</a>
<br>
</p><i>Muhammad Sedik, Shijun Sun, Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov</i>
<p>Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as
effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In
the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic
susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the
limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing
the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by
frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically
quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range
antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the
vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around
it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the
material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match
the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our
conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and
next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial
correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions
of vacancy quasispins.

<h3>Witnessing Quantum Entanglement Using Resonant Inelastic X-ray  Scattering</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tianhao Ren, Yao Shen, Sophia F. R. TenHuisen, Jennifer Sears, Wei He, Mary H. Upton, Diego Casa, Petra Becker, Matteo Mitrano, Mark P. M. Dean, Robert M. Konik</i>
<p>Although entanglement is both a central ingredient in our understanding of
quantum many-body systems and an essential resource for quantum technologies,
we only have a limited ability to quantify entanglement in real quantum
materials. Thus far, entanglement metrology in quantum materials has been
limited to measurements involving Hermitian operators, such as the detection of
spin entanglement using inelastic neutron scattering. Here, we devise a method
to extract the quantum Fisher information (QFI) from non-Hermitian operators
and formulate an entanglement witness for resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS). Our approach is then applied to the model iridate dimer system
Ba$_3$CeIr$_2$O$_9$ and used to directly test for entanglement of the
electronic orbitals between neighboring Ir sites. We find that entanglement is
challenging to detect under standard conditions, but that it could be achieved
by analyzing the outgoing x-ray polarization or via specific choices of
momentum and energy. Our protocol provides a new handle for entanglement
detection, which offers routes to related types of entanglement witness (such
as orbitally-resolved measurements) and to the generalization to
out-of-equilibrium settings accessed in ultrafast settings.

<h3>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating  Multicomponent Superfluids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</a>
<br>
</p><i>Roy Rabaglia, Ryan Barnett, Ari M. Turner</i>
<p>By examining the characteristics of a rotating ferromagnetic spinor
condensate through the perspective of large spin, we uncover a novel kind of
topological point defect in the magnetization texture. These defects are
predicted not by the conventional homotopy group analysis but by the
Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The spin texture in the system is described by an
equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a
lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice carries doubly-quantized
(winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral
configuration. The fluid is found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point
defects where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure contrasts with
the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity
concentrates exclusively within defect points, forming an unconventional
"unvortex" lattice. Numerical results are presented, which are in agreement
with the aforementioned predictions.

<h3>Current dependence of the low bias resistance of small capacitance  Josephson junctions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05890" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05890</a>
<br>
</p><i>Venkat Chandrasekhar</i>
<p>The dc current-voltage characteristics of small Josephson junctions reveal
features that are not observed in larger junctions, in particular, a switch to
the finite voltage state at current values much less than the expected critical
current of the junction and a finite resistance in the nominally
superconducting regime. Both phenomena are due to the increased sensitivity to
noise associated with the small capacitance of the Josephson junction and have
been extensively studied a few decades ago. Here I focus on the current bias
dependence of the differential resistance of the junction at low current bias
in the nominally superconducting regime, using a quantum Langevin equation
approach that enables a physically transparent incorporation of the noise
environment of the junction. A similar approach might be useful in modeling the
sensitivity of superconducting qubits to noise in the microwave regime.

<h3>Seebeck Effect of Dirac Electrons in Organic Conductors under  Hydrostatic Pressure Using a Tight-Binding Model Derived from First  Principles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05914</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yoshikazu Suzumura, Takao Tsumuraya, Masao Ogata</i>
<p>The Seebeck coefficient is examined for two-dimensional Dirac electrons in
the three-quarter filled organic conductor alpha-(BEDT-TTF)_2I_3 under
hydrostatic pressure, where the Seebeck coefficient is proportional to the
ratio of the thermoelectric conductivity to the electrical conductivity. We
present an improved tight-binding model in two dimensions with transfer
energies determined from first-principles density functional theory
calculations with an experimentally determined crystal structure. The
temperatutre dependence of the Seebeck coefficient is calculated by adding
impurity and electron-phonon scatterings. Noting a zero-gap state due to the
Dirac cone, which results in a competition from contributions between the
conduction and valence bands, we show positive S_x and S_y at finite
temperatures and analyze them in terms of spectral conductivity. The relevance
of the calculated S_x (perpendicular to the molecular stacking axis) to the
experiment is discussed.

<h3>Excited-State Dynamics and Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance of  Solid-State Spin Defects from First Principles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05917" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05917</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kejun Li, Vsevolod D. Dergachev, Ilya D. Dergachev, Shimin Zhang, Sergey A. Varganov, Yuan Ping</i>
<p>Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient and reliable
method that enables initialization and readout of spin states through
spin-photon interface. In general, high quantum efficiency and large
spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) contrast are desirable for reliable
quantum information readout. However, reliable prediction of the ODMR contrast
from first-principles requires accurate description of complex spin
polarization mechanisms of spin defects. These mechanisms often include
multiple radiative and nonradiative processes in particular intersystem
crossing (ISC) among multiple excited electronic states. In this work we
present our implementation of the first-principles ODMR contrast, by solving
kinetic master equation with calculated rates from ab initio electronic
structure methods then benchmark the implementation on the case of the
negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We show the
importance of correct description of multi-reference electronic states for
accurate prediction of excitation energy, spin-orbit coupling, and the rate of
ISC. Moreover, we underscore the importance of pseudo Jahn-Teller effect for
the spin-orbit coupling, and the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect for
electron-phonon coupling, key factors determining ISC rates and ODMR contrast.
We show good agreement between our first-principles calculations and the
experimental ODMR contrast under magnetic field. We then demonstrate reliable
predictions of magnetic field direction, pump power, and microwave frequency
dependency, as important parameters for ODMR experiments. Our work clarifies
the important excited-state relaxation mechanisms determining ODMR contrast and
provides a predictive computational platform for spin polarization and optical
readout of solid-state quantum defects from first principles.

<h3>Dressed Majorana fermion in a hybrid nanowire</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05935" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05935</a>
<br>
</p><i>Guo-Jian Qiao, Xin Yue, C. P. Sun</i>
<p>The low-energy theory of hybrid nanowire systems fails to define Majorana
fermion (MF) in the strong tunneling and magnetic field strength. To address
this limitation, we propose a holistic approach to define MF in which the
quasi-excitation in nanowire and superconductor constitutes together its own
``antiparticles''. This definition is general, beyond the constraint presented
in the low-energy theory. It reveals that the Majorana phase depends not only
on the chemical potential and Zeeman energy in nanowire but also on those of
superconductor, and that the mismatch of chemical potential leads not to
observe MF. Such a broader perspective provides more specific experimental
guidance under various conditions

<h3>Thermoelectric transport and current noise through a multilevel Anderson  impurity: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections in quantum dots and magnetic  alloys</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05947" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05947</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yoshimichi Teratani, Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, Kaiji Motoyama, Rui Sakano, Akira Oguri</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric
transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and
magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our
formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$
discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to
the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature
$T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms
of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation
functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to
the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity
electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and
calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical
renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be
determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1
\lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they
also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer
values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD
and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the
electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz
value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$
dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations
away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations
on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.

<p>Atomic disorder, a widespread problem in compound crystalline materials, is a
imperative affecting the performance of multi-chalcogenide Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4
(CZTSSe) photovoltaic device known for its low cost and environmental
friendliness. Cu-Zn disorder is particularly abundantly present in CZTSSe due
to its extraordinarily low formation energy, having induced high-concentration
deep defects and severe charge loss, while its regulation remains challenging
due to the contradiction between disorder-order phase transition thermodynamics
and atom-interchange kinetics. Herein, through introducing more vacancies in
the CZTSSe surface, we explored a vacancy-assisted strategy to reduce the
atom-interchange barrier limit to facilitate the Cu-Zn ordering kinetic
process. The improvement in the Cu-Zn order degree has significantly reduced
the charge loss in the device and helped us realize 15.4% (certified at 14.9%)
and 13.5% efficiency (certified at 13.3%) in 0.27 cm2 and 1.1 cm2-area CZTSSe
solar cells, respectively, thus bringing substantial advancement for emerging

<h3>Properties of a Majorana fermion ensemble with exciton-like mass</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05978" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05978</a>
<br>
</p><i>L. E. S. Machado, F. C. E. Lima, C. A. S. Almeida</i>
<p>Considering the relativistic scenario, we dedicate our study to the
relativistic quantum description of one-dimensional Majorana fermions. Thus, we
focus on aspects related to exciton-like particles. Seeking to reach our
purpose, one analyzes the relativistic quantum mechanical system characterized
by an effective mass distribution. In this context, we adopt an exciton-like
position-dependent mass without impurity, i.e., without electromagnetic
interactions. From this perspective, one notes results of noteworthy interest
as consequences of the theory adopted. For instance, we highlight that, even
without interaction, exciton-like Majorana fermions manifest theoretically
bound states. Also, we construct a Majorana fermion ensemble with effective
mass immersed in a thermal reservoir. That allows for a thorough investigation
of the thermodynamic properties of the system. Among the thermodynamic
characteristics studied in the canonical ensemble, we focus on the Helmholtz
free energy, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity. The numerical results

<h3>First-Order Vortex Lattice Melting in Bilayer Ice: A Monte Carlo Method  Study</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05996</a>

</p><i>Telun Zhong, Heyang Ma, Peijun Zheng, Jie Zhang, Wanzhou Zhang</i>
<p>Inspired by the stable bilayer water ice grown in the laboratory (Nature 577,
60, 2020), we propose a model representing water ice as a two-layer six-vertex
model. Using the loop update Monte Carlo method, we unveil meaningful findings.
While the square lattice six-vertex model exhibits an antiferromagnetic to
disordered phase transition known as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition, we observe a different scenario for the bilayer six-vertex model,
where the transition type transforms into an Ising transition. We discover the
emergence of vortices in the disordered phase, and to stabilize them, vortex
excitation is induced. This leads to the presence of distinct 1/2 filling and
2/3 filling vortex lattice phases. Importantly, we identify the phase
transitions between the vortex lattice phase and the disorder phase, as well as
between the 1/2 and 2/3 vortex lattices, as being of first order. Our findings
provide valuable insights into the nature of phase transitions occurring in
layered water ice and artificial spin ice systems in experimental setups.

<p>Nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), as a new member of Hall effect family, has been
realized in many materials, attracting a great deal of attention. Here, we
report the observation of NLHE in magnetic topological insulator Sb-doped
MnBi4Te7 flakes. The NLHE generation efficiency can reach up to 0.06 V^-1,
which is comparable to that observed in MnBi2Te4. Differently, the NLHE can
survive up to 200 K, much larger than the magnetic transition temperature. We
further study the scaling behavior of the NLHE with longitudinal conductivity.
The linear relationship with opposite slope when temperature is below and above
the magnetic transition temperature is uncovered. It reveals that the NLHE
originates from skew scattering. Our work provides a platform to search NLHE
with larger generation efficiency at higher temperatures.

<h3>Magnetic field control of continuous Néel vector rotation and Néel  temperature in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Zhuoliang Ni, Urban Seifert, Amanda V. Haglund, Nan Huang, David G. Mandrus, Leon Balents, Liang Wu</i>
<p>In a collinear antiferromagnet, spins tend to cant towards the direction of
an applied magnetic field, thereby decreasing the energy of the system. The
canting angle becomes negligible when the magnetic field is small so that the
induced anisotropic energy is substantially lower than the exchange energy.
However, this tiny anisotropy can play a significant role when the intrinsic
anisotropy of the antiferromagnet is small. In our work, we conduct direct
imaging of the N\'eel vector in a two-dimensional easy-plane antiferromagnet,
MnPSe$_3$, with negligible spin canting under an external in-plane magnetic
field. The small inherent in-plane anisotropy allows for the continuous
rotation of the N\'eel vector by ramping up the magnetic field in samples from
the bulk to the monolayer. In monolayer samples, the applied magnetic field
elevates the N\'eel temperature 10$\%$ at 5 tesla, as the combination of
intrinsic and field-induced anisotropies set a critical temperature scale for
fluctuations of the otherwise disordered N\'eel vector field. Our study
illuminates the contribution of field-induced anisotropy in two dimensional
magnets with in-plane anisotropy. We also demonstrate that the strain can tune
the spin flop transition field strength by one order of magnitude.

<h3>Correlation decoupling of Casimir interaction in an electrolyte driven  by external electric fields</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06028" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06028</a>
<br>
</p><i>Guangle Du, David S. Dean, Bing Miao, Rudolf Podgornik</i>
<p>It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or
thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by
a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this
interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied
parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady
state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal
repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction
between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$.
At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to
an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling
mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at
large applied fields.

<h3>Inverse melting and intertwined orders in PrCuSb$_2$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>H. Q. Ye, Y. N. Zhang, T. Le, H. Q. Yuan, M. Smidman</i>
<p>Much of the rich physics of correlated systems is manifested in the diverse
range of intertwined ordered phases and other quantum states that are
associated with different electronic and structural degrees of freedom. Here we
find that PrCuSb$_2$ exhibits such phenomena, which at ambient pressure
exhibits a fragile antiferromagnetic order, where cooling in a small $c$ axis
magnetic field leads to an additional transition to a field-induced
ferromagnetic state. This corresponds to an 'inverse melting' effect, whereby
further cooling the system restores symmetries of the paramagnetic state broken
at the antiferromagnetic transition. Moreover, hydrostatic pressure induces an
additional first-order transition at low temperatures, which despite being not
likely associated with solely magnetic degrees of freedom, is closely entwined
with the magnetic order, disappearing once antiferromagnetism is destroyed by
pressure or magnetic fields. Consequently, PrCuSb$_2$ presents a distinct
scenario for interplay between different orders, underscoring the breadth of
such behaviors within one family of correlated materials.

<p>Topological defects, or singularities, play a key role in the statics and
dynamics of complex systems. In magnetism, Bloch point singularities represent
point defects that mediate the nucleation of textures such as skyrmions and
hopfions. However, while the textures are typically stabilised in chiral
magnets, the influence of chirality on the Bloch point singularities remains
relatively unexplored. Here we harness advanced three-dimensional
nanofabrication to explore the influence of chirality on Bloch point
singularities by introducing curvature-induced symmetry breaking in a
ferromagnetic nanowire. Combining X-ray magnetic microscopy with the
application of in situ magnetic fields, we demonstrate that Bloch point
singularity-containing domain walls are stabilised in straight regions of the
sample, and determine that curvature can be used to tune the energy landscape
of the Bloch points. Not only are we able to pattern pinning points but, by
controlling the gradient of curvature, we define asymmetric potential wells to
realise a robust Bloch point shift-register with non-reciprocal behaviour.
These insights into the influence of symmetry and chirality on singularities
offers a route to the controlled nucleation and propagation of topological
textures, providing opportunities for logic and computing devices.

<h3>The Effects of Splayed Lipid Molecules on Lubrication by Lipid Bilayers</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Di Jin, Jacob Klein</i>
<p>The outstanding lubrication of articular cartilage in the major synovial
joints such as hips and knees, essential for the joint well-being, has been
attributed to boundary layers of lipids at the outer cartilage surfaces, which
have very low friction mediated by the hydration lubrication mechanism at their
highly hydrated exposed headgroups. However, the role of spontaneously present
lipid splays, lipids with an acyl tail in each of the opposing bilayers, in
modulating the frictional force between lipid bilayers has not, to date, been
considered. In this study, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
to quantitatively assess the significance of splayed molecules within the
framework of lubricating lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, although
transient, splayed molecules significantly increase the inter-membrane friction
until their retraction back into the lamellar phase, with this effect more
steadily occurring at lower sliding velocities that are comparable to the
physiological velocities of sliding articular cartilage.

<p>Deterministic light sources capable of generating quantum states on-demand at
wavelengths compatible with fiber optics and atmospheric transmission are
essential for practical applications in quantum communication, photonic quantum
computing, and quantum metrology. To this end, single-photon emission at 1500
nm is demonstrated from an InGaSb quantum dot (QD) grown by filling
droplet-etched nanoholes for the first time. The QD was embedded in a device
structure comprising an antimony-based high refractive index contrast
back-reflector designed for cryogenic operation and a solid immersion lens for
improved photon extraction. The longitudinal optical (LO) phonon assisted
excitation of the QD ground state and quasi-resonant excitation of the QD
excited state is realized with a novel compact wavelength-tunable
power-stabilized semiconductor laser. These direct approaches to exciting a
single QD unlock access to its excitonic fine structure. The neutral
exciton-biexciton structure exhibits a negative binding energy of 1.4 meV (2.6
nm) and a fine structure splitting of 24.1+/-0.4 ueV. Furthermore, spectrally
pure/isolated emission from a charged single exciton state with a single-photon
purity of 95 % is achieved with LO phonon assisted two-color excitation. These
results represent a major step forward for the use of the novel
antimonide-based QD emitters as deterministic quantum light sources in complex
quantum secure networks exploiting the wavelength compatibility with standard
telecom fibers.

<h3>Hydrostatic pressure control of the spin-orbit proximity effect and spin  relaxation in a phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure</h3>

<p>Effective control of interlayer interactions is a key element in modifying
the properties of van der Waals heterostructures and the next step toward their
practical applications. Focusing on the phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure, we
demonstrate, using first-principles calculations, how the spin-orbit coupling
can be transferred from WSe$_2$, a strong spin-orbit coupling material, to
phosphorene and further amplified by applying vertical pressure. We simulate
external pressure by changing the interlayer distance between bilayer
constituents and show that it is possible to tune the spin-orbit field of
phosphorene holes in a controllable way. By fitting effective electronic states
of the proposed Hamiltonian to the first principles data, we reveal that the
spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene hole bands is enhanced more than two times
for experimentally accessible pressures up to 17 kbar. Finally, we find that
the pressure-enhanced spin-orbit coupling boosts the Dyakonov-Perel spin
relaxation mechanism, reducing the spin lifetime of phosphorene holes by factor
4.

</p><i>Máté Lencsés, Alessio Miscioscia, Giuseppe Mussardo, Gábor Takács</i>
<p>We revisit and extend Fisher's argument for a Ginzburg-Landau description of
multicritical Yang-Lee models in terms of a single boson Lagrangian with
potential $\varphi^2 (i \varphi)^n$. We explicitly study the cases of $n=1,2$
by a Truncated Hamiltonian Approach based on the free massive boson perturbed
by $\boldsymbol P\boldsymbol T$ symmetric deformations, providing clear
evidence of the spontaneous breaking of $\boldsymbol P \boldsymbol T$ symmetry.
For $n=1$, the symmetric and the broken phases are separated by the critical
point corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$, while for $n=2$,
they are separated by a critical manifold corresponding to the minimal model
$\mathcal M(2,5)$ with $\mathcal M(2,7)$ on its boundary. Our numerical
analysis strongly supports our Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for multicritical
Yang-Lee models.

focus on the operator product expansions of the two-point function and the
response function. At the fixed point, we normalize the coefficients and the
scaling variables so that the result displays universality. The role of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem is also discussed, and it is shown that it
provides non-perturbative relations among the operator product expansion

<p>A systematic investigation has been performed by synthesis and comprehensive
characterization of a series of SmFe1-xCuxAsO0.8F0.2 bulks (x = 0 to 0.2).
These samples are well characterized by structural, Raman spectroscopy,
microstructural, transport, magnetic measurements, and supplementary
calculations within density functional theory (DFT). The parent compound,
SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111), exhibits a superconducting transition temperature (Tc)
of approximately 54 K. The lattice volume (V) is increased with Cu substitution
(x) without observing any impurity phase related to copper, which confirms the
successful incorporation of Cu at Fe sites in the superconducting FeAs layers.
These analyses are also well in agreement with Raman spectroscopy measurements
and relevant DFT results. The superconducting transition is decreased
systematically with copper doping and completely suppressed for 7% Cu-doped
Sm1111 (x = 0.07). A large amount of Cu substitution (x greater than 0.07) has
demonstrated the metal to insulate transition in the low-temperature range, and
no impurity phase was observed even at high Cu doping levels (x = 0.2). The
calculated critical current density of the parent sample is suppressed with
copper substitution, suggesting the reduced pinning centers, sample density,
and grain connections, as confirmed by the microstructural analysis. Our
studies suggest that the substitution of Cu in the superconducting FeAs layer,
resulting the enlargement of the lattice volume, is a source of strong disorder
scattering, leading to the suppression of Tc and the emergence of
metal-to-insulator, unlike the more successful carrier doping by nickel (Ni) or
cobalt (Co), as previously reported.

<h3>Probing the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex unbinding transition  in two-dimensional superconductors using local noise magnetometry</h3>

<p>The melting of quasi-long-range superconductivity in two spatial dimensions
occurs through the proliferation and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a
phenomenon known as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition.
Although signatures of this transition have been observed in bulk measurements,
these experiments are often complicated, ambiguous, and unable to resolve the
rich physics of the vortex unbinding transition. Here we show that local noise
magnetometry is a sensitive, noninvasive probe that can provide direct
information about the scale-dependent vortex dynamics. In particular, by
resolving the distance and temperature dependence of the magnetic noise, it may
be possible to experimentally study the renormalization group flow equations of
the vortex gas and track the onset of vortex unbinding in situ. Specifically,
we predict i) a nonmonotonic dependence of the noise on temperature and ii) the
local noise is almost independent of the sample-probe distance at the BKT
transition. We also show that noise magnetometry can distinguish Gaussian
superconducting order-parameter fluctuations from topological vortex
fluctuations and can detect the emergence of unbound vortices. The weak
distance dependence at the BKT transition can also be used to distinguish it
from quasiparticle background noise. Our predictions may be within experimental
reach for a number of unconventional superconductors.

<p>By considering the quench dynamics of two-dimensional frustrated Ising models
through numerical simulations, we investigate the dynamical critical behavior
on the multicritical Nishimori point (NP). We calculate several dynamical
critical exponents, namely, the relaxation exponent $z_{\rm c}$, the
autocorrelation exponent $\lambda_{\rm c}$, and the persistence exponent
$\theta_{\rm c}$, after a quench from the high temperature phase to the NP. We
confirm their universality with respect to the lattice geometry and bond
distribution. For a quench from a power-law correlated initial state to the NP,
the aging dynamics are much slower. We also look up the issue of
multifractality during the critical dynamics by investigating different moments
of the spatial correlation function. We observe a single growth law for all the
length scales extracted from different moments, indicating that the equilibrium
multifractality at the NP does not affect the dynamics.

</p><i>Bosiljka Tadic, Roderick Melnik</i>
<p>In functionally complex systems, higher-order connectivity is often revealed
in the underlying geometry of networked units. Furthermore, such systems often
show signatures of self-organized criticality, a specific type of
non-equilibrium collective behaviour associated with an attractor of internal
dynamics with long-range correlations and scale invariance, which ensures the
robust functioning of complex systems, such as the brain. Here, we highlight
the intertwining of features of higher-order geometry and self-organized
critical dynamics as a plausible mechanism for the emergence of new properties
on a larger scale, representing the central paradigm of the physical notion of
complexity. Considering the time scale of the structural evolution with the
known separation of the time scale in self-organized criticality, i.e.,
internal dynamics and external driving, we distinguish three classes of
geometries that can shape the self-organized dynamics on them differently. We
provide an overview of current trends in the study of collective dynamics
phenomena, such as the synchronization of phase oscillators and discrete spin
dynamics with higher-order couplings embedded in the faces of simplicial
complexes. For a representative example of self-organized critical behaviour
induced by higher-order structures, we present a more detailed analysis of the
dynamics of field-driven spin reversal on the hysteresis loops in simplicial
complexes composed of triangles. These numerical results suggest that two
fundamental interactions representing the edge-embedded and triangle-embedded
couplings must be taken into account in theoretical models to describe the
influence of higher-order geometry on critical dynamics.

<p>Topological defects are ubiquitous, they manifest in a wide variety of
systems such as liquid crystals, magnets or superconductors. The recent quest
for nonabelian anyons in condensed matter physics stimulates the interest for
topological defects since they can be hosted in vortices in quantum magnets or
topological superconductors. In addition to these vortex defects, in this study
we propose to investigate edge dislocations in 2D magnets as new building
blocks for topological physics since they can be described as vortices in the
structural phase field. Here we demonstrate the existence of higher order
topological dislocations within the higher order moir\'e pattern of the van der
Waals 2D magnet CrCl3 deposited on Au(111). Surprizingly, these higher order
dislocations arise from ordinary simple edge dislocations in the atomic lattice
of CrCl3. We provide a theoretical framework explaining the higher order
dislocations as vortex with a winding Chern number of 2. We expect that these
original defects could stabilize some anyons either in a 2D quantum magnet or
within a 2D superconductor coupled to it.

<p>Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting
microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the
qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by
parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are
detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit CZ gates have been
proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA).
Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths
become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the
detrimental impact of time-dependent terms ignored by RWA is critical for
high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for
both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the
charge qubit that produces fewer time-dependent terms and show that it
outperforms its spin counterpart. We find that drive amplitude - a parameter
dropped in RWA - is critical for optimizing fidelity and map out high-fidelity
regimes. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in
understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge
qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.

<h3>Transport resistance strikes back: unveiling its impact on fill factor  losses in organic solar cells</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Maria Saladina, Carsten Deibel</i>
<p>The fill factor ($FF$) is a critical parameter for solar cell efficiency, yet
its analytical description is challenging due to the interplay between
recombination and charge extraction processes. An often overlooked yet
significant factor contributing to $FF$ losses, beyond recombination, is the
influence of charge transport. In most state-of-the-art organic solar cells,
the primary limitation of the $FF$ arises not from recombination but rather
from low conductivity, highlighting the need for refined models to predict the
$FF$ accurately. Here, we extend the analytical model for transport resistance
to a more general case. Drawing from a large set of experimental
current-voltage and light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage data, we
systematically incorporate crucial details previously omitted in the model.
Consequently, we introduce a straightforward set of equations to predict the
$FF$ of a solar cell, enabling the differentiation of losses attributed to
recombination and transport resistance. Our study provides valuable insights
into strategies for mitigating $FF$ losses based on the experimentally
validated analytical model, guiding the development of more efficient solar
cell designs and optimization strategies.

<p>The structure of liquid foams follows simple geometric rules formulated by
Plateau 150 years ago. By placing such foam on a microtextured hydrophilic
surface, we show that the bubble footprint exhibits a morphological transition.
This transition concerns the liquid channels, also called pseudo Plateau
borders, which are straight between vertices on a smooth surface. We
demonstrate experimentally that for a sufficiently large roughness size
compared to the width of the liquid channels, the footprint adopts a zigzag
shape. This transition is associated with the absence of a wetting film between
the pillars caused by capillary suction of the foam, observed by confocal
microscopy. We rationalize the number of zigzag segments by a geometric
distribution describing the observations made with the footprint perimeter and
the mesh size of the asperities.

<p>Many deep neural networks have been used to solve Ising models, including
autoregressive neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural
networks, and graph neural networks. Learning a probability distribution of
energy configuration or finding the ground states of a disordered, fully
connected Ising model is essential for statistical mechanics and NP-hard
problems. Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the
ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely
intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a
variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which
can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new
network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in
solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger
spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great
mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural
networks. Considering these extremely difficult problems to be solved, our
method extends the current computational limits of unsupervised neural networks
to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

<p>In this numerical work, we find a self-consistent constant scattering
superconducting lifetime for two different values of the disorder parameters,
the inverse atomic strength, and the stoichiometric impurity in the triplet
paired unconventional super-conductor strontium ruthenate. This finding is
relevant for experimentalists given that the expressions for the ultrasound
attenuation and the electronic thermal conductivity depend on the
superconducting scattering lifetime, and a constant lifetime fits well
nonequilibrium experimental data. Henceforth, this work helps experimentalists
in their interpretation of the acquired data. Additionally, we encountered tiny

sensitive hard and soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were utilized in
combination with density-functional theory (DFT) plus dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT) calculations. The energy dependence of the photoionization
cross-sections allows the disentanglement of the U\,$5f$ contribution to the
valence band from the various other atomic subshells so that the computational
parameters in the DFT\,+\,DMFT can be reliably determined. Applying this method
to UGa$_2$ and UB$_2$ as model compounds from opposite ends of the
(de)localization range, we have achieved excellent simulations of the valence
band and core-level spectra. The width in the distribution of atomic U\,$5f$
configurations contributing to the ground state, as obtained from the
calculations, quantifies the correlated nature and degree of localization of
the U\,5$f$. The findings permit answering the longstanding question why
different spectroscopic techniques give seemingly different numbers for the U
5$f$ valence in intermetallic U compounds.

<h3>Size selection of crack front defects: Multiple fracture-plane  interactions and intrinsic lengthscales</h3>

<p>Material failure is mediated by the propagation of cracks, which in realistic
3D materials typically involve multiple coexisting fracture planes. Multiple
fracture-plane interactions create poorly understood out-of-plane crack
structures, such as step defects on tensile fracture surfaces. Steps form once
a slowly moving, distorted crack front segments into disconnected overlapping
fracture planes separated by a stabilizing distance $h_{\rm max}$. Our
experiments on numerous brittle hydrogels reveal that $h_{\rm max}$ varies
linearly with both a nonlinear elastic length $\Gamma(v)/\mu$ and a dissipation
length $\xi$. Here, $\Gamma(v)$ is the measured crack velocity $v$-dependent
fracture energy and $\mu$ is the shear modulus. These intrinsic lengthscales
point the way to a fundamental understanding of multiple-crack interactions in
3D that lead to the formation of stable out-of-plane fracture structures.

<p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character
depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we
theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally
aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on
(and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability
analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of
non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric
clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the
emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation
of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and
susceptibilities. In particular, our findings demonstrate that certain
dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical
clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making
microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of
non-reciprocal alignment couplings.

<p>Taking advantage of the competition between elasticity and capillarity has
proven to be an efficient way to design structures by folding, bending, or
assembling elastic objects in contact with liquid interfaces. Elastocapillary
effects often occur at scales where gravity does not play an important role,
such as in microfabrication processes. However, the influence of gravity can
become significant at the desktop scale, which is relevant for numerous
situations including model experiments used to provide a fundamental physics
understanding, working at easily accessible scales. We focus here on the case
of elastic ribbons placed in two-dimensional bubble columns: by introducing an
elastic ribbon inside the central soap films of a staircase bubble structure in
a square cross-section column, the deviation from Plateau's laws
(capillarity-dominated case dictating the shape of usual foams) can be
quantified as a function of the rigidity of the ribbon. For long ribbons,
gravity cannot be neglected. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the
ribbon profile, taking into account capillarity, elasticity and gravity. We
compute the total energy of the system and perform energy minimization under
constraints, using Lagrangian mechanics. The model is then validated via a
comparison with experiments with three different ribbon thicknesses.

<h3>Hierarchy of Exchange-Correlation Functionals in Computing Lattice  Thermal Conductivities of Rocksalt and Zincblende Semiconductors</h3>

<p>Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) is a crucial characteristic
of crystalline solids with significant implications for practical applications.
While the higher order of anharmonicity of phonon gas model is commonly used
for explaining extraordinary heat transfer behaviors in crystals, the impact of
exchange-correlation (XC) functionals in DFT on describing anharmonicity has
been largely overlooked. Most XC functionals in solids focus on ground state
properties that mainly involve the harmonic approximation, neglecting
temperature effects, and their reliability in studying anharmonic properties
remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we systematically investigate
the room-temperature $\kappa_{\rm L}$ of 16 binary compounds with rocksalt and
zincblende structures using 8 XC functionals such as LDA, PBE, PBEsol, optB86b,
revTPSS, SCAN, rSCAN, r$^2$SCAN in combination with three perturbation orders,
including phonon within harmonic approximation (HA) plus three-phonon
scattering (HA+3ph), phonon calculated using self-consistent phonon theory
(SCPH) plus three-phonon scattering (SCPH+3ph), and SCPH phonon plus three- and
four-phonon scattering (SCPH+3,4ph). Our results show that the XC functional
exhibits strong entanglement with perturbation order and the mean relative
absolute error (MRAE) of the computed $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is strongly influenced
by both the XC functional and perturbation order, leading to error cancellation
or amplification. The minimal (maximal) MRAE is achieved with revTPSS (rSCAN)
at the HA+3ph level, SCAN (r$^2$SCAN) at the SCPH+3ph level, and PBEsol (rSCAN)
at the SCPH+3,4ph level. Among these functionals, PBEsol exhibits the highest
accuracy at the highest perturbation order. The SCAN-related functionals
demonstrate moderate accuracy but are suffer from numerical instability and
high computational costs.

<h3>Magnon transmission across $ν=1|-1|1$ mono-layer graphene junction as  a probe of electronic structure</h3>

<p>We study magnon transmission across gate-controlled junctions in the $n=0$
manifold of Landau levels in monolayer graphene, allowing for both spin and
valley Zeeman fields. We show that by tuning the external perpendicular
magnetic field, the phase in the intermediate region of a $1|\nu_m|1$ sandwich
geometry can be changed, due to which the magnon transmission can be switched
between fully transmitting and fully blocked. Our analysis, along with the
experimental measurements, can be used to determine the anisotropic couplings
in the sample.

<p>R\'enyi entropy is a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, which
has been used in various fields of physics. Despite its wide applicability, the
physical interpretations of the R\'enyi entropy are not widely known. In this
paper, we discuss some basic properties of the R\'enyi entropy relevant to
physics, in particular statistical mechanics, and its physical interpretations
using free energy, replicas, work, and large deviation.

<p>Moir\'e-twisted materials have garnered significant research interest due to
their distinctive properties and intriguing physics. However, conducting
first-principles studies on such materials faces challenges, notably the
formidable computational cost associated with simulating ultra-large twisted
structures. This obstacle impedes the construction of a twisted materials
database crucial for datadriven materials discovery. Here, by using
high-throughput calculations and state-of-the-art neural network methods, we
construct a Deep-learning Database of density functional theory (DFT)
Hamiltonians for Twisted materials named DDHT. The DDHT database comprises
trained neural-network models of over a hundred homo-bilayer and hetero-bilayer
moir\'e-twisted materials. These models enable accurate prediction of the DFT
Hamiltonian for these materials across arbitrary twist angles, with an averaged
mean absolute error of approximately 1.0 meV or lower. The database facilitates
the exploration of flat bands and correlated materials platforms within
ultra-large twisted structures.

<h3>Laue Indexing with Optimal Transport</h3>

<p>Laue tomography experiments retrieve the positions and orientations of
crystal grains in a polycrystalline samples from diffraction patterns recorded
at multiple viewing angles. The use of a broad wavelength spectrum beam can
greatly reduce the experimental time, but poses a difficult challenge for the
indexing of diffraction peaks in polycrystalline samples; the information about
the wavelength of these Bragg peaks is absent and the diffraction patterns from
multiple grains are superimposed. To date, no algorithms exist capable of
indexing samples with more than about 500 grains efficiently. To address this
need we present a novel method: Laue indexing with Optimal Transport (LaueOT).
We create a probabilistic description of the multi-grain indexing problem and
propose a solution based on Sinkhorn Expectation-Maximization method, which
allows to efficiently find the maximum of the likelihood thanks to the
assignments being calculated using Optimal Transport. This is a non-convex
optimization problem, where the orientations and positions of grains are
optimized simultaneously with grain-to-spot assignments, while robustly
handling the outliers. The selection of initial prototype grains to consider in
the optimization problem are also calculated within the Optimal Transport
framework. LaueOT can rapidly and effectively index up to 1000 grains on a
single large memory GPU within less than 30 minutes. We demonstrate the
performance of LaueOT on simulations with variable numbers of grains, spot
position measurement noise levels, and outlier fractions. The algorithm
recovers the correct number of grains even for high noise levels and up to 70%
outliers in our experiments. We compare the results of indexing with LaueOT to
existing algorithms both on synthetic and real neutron diffraction data from
well-characterized samples.

<h3>Existence of Mexican-hat dispersion and symmetry group of a layer</h3>

</p><i>Vladimir Damljanovic</i>
<p>Increased interest in physics of graphene and other two-dimensional materials
boosted investigations of band structure near nodal points and lines. In
contrast, group theoretical explanation of simple bands (that do not touch
other bands), is sporadically present in the literature. This paper presents
electronic dispersions up to forth order in momentum, near Brillouin zone (BZ)
high symmetry points of all eighty layer groups. The method applies to non
magnetic materials both with or without spin-orbit coupling. Particular
attention is devoted to Mexican-hat dispersion, showing that it can appear only
at BZ center of hexagonal layer groups. Presented symmetry adapted Taylor
expansion of bands can be used to fit ab-initio or experimental band
structures, or for analytical calculation of crystal properties. The results
presented here might serve also as a guiding tool for design of new
two-dimensional materials.

<h3>A Machine Learning Framework for the Prediction of Grain Boundary  Segregation in Chemically Complex Environments</h3>

<p>The discovery of complex concentrated alloys has unveiled materials with
diverse atomic environments, prompting the exploration of solute segregation
beyond dilute alloys. Data-driven methods offer promising for modeling
segregation in such chemically complex environments, and are employed in this
study to understand segregation behavior of a refractory complex concentrated
alloy, NbMoTaW. A flexible methodology is developed that uses composable
computational modules, with different arrangements of these modules employed to
obtain site availabilities at absolute zero and the corresponding density of
states beyond the dilute limit, resulting in an extremely large dataset
containing 10 million data points. The artificial neural network developed here
can rely solely on descriptions of local atomic environments to predict
behavior at the dilute limit with very small errors, while the addition of
negative segregation instance classification allows any solute concentration
from zero up to the equiatomic concentration for ternary or quaternary alloys
to be modeled at room temperature. The machine learning model thus achieves a
significant speed advantage over traditional atomistic simulations, being four
orders of magnitude faster, while only experiencing a minimal reduction in
accuracy. This efficiency presents a powerful tool for rapid microstructural
and interfacial design in unseen domains. Scientifically, our approach reveals
a transition in the segregation behavior of Mo from unfavorable in simple
systems to favorable in complex environments. Additionally, increasing solute
concentration was observed to cause anti-segregation sites to begin to fill,
challenging conventional understanding and highlighting the complexity of
segregation dynamics in chemically complex environments.
