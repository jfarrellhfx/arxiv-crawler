<h3>Hidden Critical Points in the Two-Dimensional $O(n>2)$ model: Exact  Numerical Study of a Complex Conformal Field Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02171" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02171</a>

The presence of nearby conformal field theories (CFTs) hidden in the complex
plane of the tuning parameter was recently proposed as an elegant explanation
for the ubiquity of "weakly first-order" transitions in condensed matter and
high-energy systems. In this work, we perform an exact microscopic study of
such a complex CFT (CCFT) in the two-dimensional $O(n)$ loop model. The
well-known absence of symmetry-breaking of the $O(n>2)$ model is understood as
arising from the displacement of the non-trivial fixed points into the complex
temperature plane. Thanks to a numerical finite-size study of the transfer
matrix, we confirm the presence of a CCFT in the complex plane and extract the
real and imaginary parts of the central charge and scaling dimensions. By
comparing those with the analytic continuation of predictions from Coulomb gas
techniques, we determine the range of validity of the analytic continuation to
extend up to $n_g \approx 12.34$, beyond which the CCFT gives way to a gapped
state. Finally, we propose a beta function which reproduces the main features
of the phase diagram and which suggests an interpretation of the CCFT as a
liquid-gas critical point at the end of a first-order transition line.

<h3>Theory of resonantly enhanced photo-induced superconductivity</h3>

Optical driving of materials has emerged as a promising tool to control their
macroscopic properties. In this work we present a microscopic mechanism for
efficiently photo-inducing superconductivity. We investigate an attractive
electron-electron interaction mediated by a boson that couples to an electronic
transition between two bands separated by a band gap. While this attraction is
small in equilibrium, we find that it can be increased by several orders of
magnitude when the bosons are driven into a nonthermal state. Moreover, not
only is the induced attraction enhanced when the bosons are driven, but this
enhancement is further amplified when the boson is near-resonant to the
electronic interband excitation energy, making this mechanism a potentially
ideal candidate for efficient photo-induced superconductivity. We first use
exact diagonalisation calculations of a two-site model to prove that pairing is
indeed resonantly enhanced out-of equilibrium. We then investigate the
potential of this mechanism to increase the superconducting transition
temperature, and find by investigating the gap equation that pairing is
resonantly amplified when the bosons are in a nonthermal state. We argue that
our proposed mechanism provides a simple prescription for designing new
platforms that enable photo-induced superconductivity at significant
temperatures and moderate driving strengths, and estimate a transition
temperature $T_{\rm c} \approx 5\rm{K}$ for a $\rm SrTiO_3$ -- graphene
heterostructure.

<h3>Modeling growing confluent tissues using a lattice Boltzmann method:  interface stability and fluctuations</h3>

Tissue growth underpins a wide array of biological and developmental
processes, and numerical modeling of growing systems has been shown to be a
useful tool for understanding these processes. However, the phenomena that can
be captured are often limited by the size of systems that can be modeled. Here,
we address this limitation by introducing a Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) for
a growing system that is able to efficiently model hydrodynamic length-scales.
The model incorporates a novel approach to describing the growing front of a
tissue, which we use to investigate the dynamics of the interface of growing
model tissues. We find that the interface grows with scaling in agreement with
the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class when growth in the system is
bulk driven. Interestingly, we also find the emergence of a previously
unreported hydrodynamic instability when proliferation is restricted to the
tissue edge. We then develop an analytical theory to show that the instability
arises due to a coupling between the number of cells actively proliferating and
the position of the interface.

<h3>Machine learning of twin/matrix interfaces from local stress field</h3>

Twinning is an important deformation mode in plastically deformed hexagonal
close-packed materials. The extremely high twin growth rates at the nanoscale
make atomistic simulations an attractive method for investigating the role of
individual twin/matrix interfaces such as twin boundaries and basal-prismatic
interfaces in twin growth kinetics. Unfortunately, there is no single framework
that allows researchers to differentiate such interfaces automatically, neither
in experimental in-situ transmission electron microscopy analysis images nor in
atomistic simulations. Moreover, the presence of alloying elements introduces
substantial noise to local atomic environments, making it nearly impossible to
identify which atoms belong to which interface. Here, with the help of advanced
machine learning methods, we provide a proof-of-concept way of using the local
stress field distribution as an indicator for the presence of interfaces and
for determining their types. We apply such an analysis to the growth of twin
embryos in Mg-10 at.% Al alloys under constant stress and constant strain
conditions, corresponding to two extremes of high and low strain rates,
respectively. We discover that the kinetics of such growth is driven by
high-energy basal-prismatic interfaces, in line with our experimental
observations for pure Mg.

<h3>Attenuating Dynamics of Strongly Interacting Fermionic Superfluids in  SYK Solvable Models</h3>

Quench dynamics of fermionic superfluids is an active topic both
experimentally and theoretically. Using the BCS theory, such non-equilibrium
problems can be reduced to nearly independent spin dynamics only with a
time-dependent mean-field pairing term. This results in persisting oscillations
of the paring strength in certain parameter regimes. In experiments, however,
it is observed that the oscillation decays rapidly when the interaction becomes
strong, such as in the unitary fermi gas. A theoretical analysis is still
absent. In this work, we construct an SYK-like model to analyze the effect of
strong interactions in one dimensional BCS system. We utilize the large-$N$
approximation and Green's function-based technique to solve the equilibrium
problem and quench dynamics. We find that a strong SYK interaction suppresses
the paring order. We further verify that the system quickly thermalizes with
SYK interactions for both intrinsic pairing order or proximity effect, which
leads to a rapid decay of the strength of the oscillations. The decay rates
exhibit different scaling laws against SYK interaction, which can be understood
in terms of the Boltzmann equation. Our work makes a first step towards the
understanding of attenuating dynamics of strongly interacting fermionic
superfluids.

<h3>Self-organized vortex phases and hydrodynamic interactions in Bos taurus  sperm cells</h3>

Flocking behavior is observed in biological systems from the cellular to
super-organismal length scales, and the mechanisms and purposes of this
behavior are objects of intense interest. In this paper, we study the
collective dynamics of bovine sperm cells in a viscoelastic fluid. Remarkably,
these cells appear not to spontaneously flock, but transition into a long-lived
flocking phase after being exposed to a transient ordering pulse of fluid flow.
Surprisingly, this induced flocking phase exhibits anisotropic giant number
fluctuations and possesses transverse density fluctuation correlations
consistent with the Toner-Tu theory of the polar fluid phase, despite the
clearly important role of momentum conservation between the swimmers and the
surrounding fluid in these experiments. In addition to these flow-induced
flocking states, we also find a self-organized global vortex state of the sperm
cells. We simulate this system, modeling the sperm as persistently turning
active particles. Although the model does not reproduce the vortex state, it
exhibits a polar-disorder phase boundary as a function of cell density and
persistence time that is predictive of the experimental phase boundary. Our
results may have implications for the evaluation of sample fertility by
studying the collective phase behavior of dense groups of swimming sperm.

<h3>Light-activated microtubule-based 2D active nematic</h3>

<br>

We characterize two-dimensional (2D) microtubule-based active nematics driven
by light-responsive kinesin motor clusters. We assess two constructs of
optogenetic kinesin: opto-K401, a processive motor, and opto-K365, a
non-processive motor. Measurements reveal an order of magnitude improvement in
the contrast of nematic flow speeds between maximally- and
minimally-illuminated states for opto-K365 motors. Focusing on opto-K365
nematics, we characterize both the steady-state flow and defect density as a
function of applied light and examine the transient behavior between
steady-states. The steady-state nematic flow and defect densities are set by
the applied light intensity across centimeter-sized samples, independent of
initial conditions. Although nematic flow reaches steady-state within tens of
seconds, the defect density exhibits transient behavior for 4 to 10 minutes,
showing a separation between small-scale active reorganization and system-scale
structural states. This work establishes an experimental platform to test
theoretical frameworks which exploit spatiotemporally-heterogeneous patterns of
activity to generate targeted dynamical states.

We show that a two-dimensional system of active particles that interact
hydrodynamically such as microswimmers can be expressed using a unifying
Hamiltonian formalism. We simulate a random arrangement of co-oriented
microswimmers and find they evolve into sharp lines at a particular tilt. We
call these states "escalators" as particles circulate along these canted
conveyor belts. We argue that the conservation of the Hamiltonian and its
symmetry germinate the self-assembly of the observed steady-state arrangements.
The Hamiltonian is scale-invariant and depends strictly on the angles between
the particles and their swimming orientation, thereby restricting their
available phase-space. Stability analysis confirms that alignment at either a
low or a high angle is unstable, and the ensemble of swimmers breaks into
escalators.

Complex or hostile environments can sometimes inhibit the movement
capabilities of diffusive particles or active swimmers, who may thus become
stuck in fixed positions. Here we analyze the dynamics of active particles in
the presence of trapping regions, where irreversible particle immobilization
occurs at a fixed rate. By solving the kinetic equations for run-and-tumble
motion in one space dimension, we give expressions for probability distribution
functions, focusing on stationary distributions of blocked particles, and mean
trapping times in terms of physical and geometrical parameters. Different
extensions of the trapping region are considered, from infinite to cases of
semi-infinite and finite intervals. The mean trapping time turns out to be
simply the inverse of the trapping rate for infinitely extended trapping zones,
while it has a nontrivial form in the semi-infinite case and is undefined for
finite domains, due to the appearance of long tails in the trapping time
distribution. We also discuss various interesting limits, describing diffusive
motion and first-passage processes in finite domains with absorbing boundaries.

Understanding oxidation mechanisms of layered semiconducting transition-metal
dichalcogenide (TMDC) is important not only for controlling native oxide
formation but also for synthesis of oxide and oxysulfide products. Here,
reactive molecular dynamics simulations show that oxygen partial pressure
controls not only the ZrS2 oxidation rate but also the oxide morphology and
quality. We find a transition from layer-by-layer oxidation to
amorphous-oxide-mediated continuous oxidation as the oxidation progresses,
where different pressures selectively expose different oxidation stages within
a given time window. While the kinetics of the fast continuous oxidation stage
is well described by the conventional Deal-Grove model, the layer-by-layer
oxidation stage is dictated by reactive bond-switching mechanisms. This work
provides atomistic details and a potential foundation for rational
pressure-controlled oxidation of broad TMDC materials.

This paper describes a novel approach to combine sixteen high resolution deep
UV (DUV EX4, 248 nm lithography) full reticle (22 mm x 22 mm) circuits to
fabricate an extremely large (88 mm x 88 mm) area superconducting integrated
circuit (ELASIC). The fabrication process starts by interconnecting four high
resolution DUV EX4 (22 mm x 22 mm) full reticles using single large field (44
mm x 44 mm) I-line (365 nm lithography) reticle, followed by I-line reticle
stitching at the boundaries of 44 mm x 44 mm fields to fabricate the complete
ELASIC field (88 mm x 88 mm). Stitched linewidths of 0.8 micron maintained high
superconducting critical currents (>30 mA) for ELASIC. Quantum flux parametron
(QFP) circuits were measured at 4.2 K to demonstrate the viability of common
active components used for data buffering and transmission. Overall, this is
the first demonstration of such a large IC produced by interconnecting high
resolution DUV reticles without stitching individual reticles.

We consider deterministic self-propelled particles with anti-alignment
interactions. An asymptotically exact kinetic theory for particle scattering at
low densities is constructed by a non-local closure of the BBGKY-hierarchy,
involving pair correlations. We show that the mean-field assumption of
molecular chaos yields unphysical predictions, whereas the scattering theory
shows excellent agreement with agent-based simulations. To extend the theory to
high densities, a self-consistent mapping to a random-telegraph process is
performed. The approach is used to derive a one-particle Langevin-equation and
leads to analytical expressions for the correlations of its effective noise.

We consider a model of Non-Brownian self-propelled particles with
anti-alignment interactions where particles try to avoid each other by
attempting to turn into opposite directions. The particles undergo apparent
Brownian motion, even though the particle's equations are fully deterministic.
We show that the deterministic interactions lead to internal, dynamical noise.
Starting from the N-particle Liouville equation, a kinetic equation for the
one-particle distribution function is obtained. We show that the usual
mean-field assumption of molecular chaos leads to qualitatively wrong
predictions such as an infinite coefficient of self-diffusion. Going beyond
mean-field and applying the refined assumption of ``one-sided molecular
chaos'', we analytically calculate the scattering of particles in the limit of
low density and obtain explicit expressions for the dynamical noise of an
effective one-particle Langevin-equation and the corresponding self-diffusion.
In this calculation, the so-called superposition principle of traditional
kinetic theory was modified to handle a system with non-Hamiltonian dynamics
involving phase-space compression. The predicted theoretical expressions for
the relaxation of hydrodynamic modes and the self-diffusion coefficient are in
excellent, quantitative agreement with agent-based simulations at small density
and small anti-alignment strength. At large particle densities, a given
particle is constantly approached and abandoned by different collision
partners. Modelling this switching of partners by a random telegraph process
and exactly solving a self-consistent integral equation, we obtain explicit
expressions for the noise correlations of the effective one-particle
Langevin-equation. Comparison with agent-based simulation show very good
agreement.

Twisting bilayer sheets of graphene have been proven to be an efficient way
to manipulate the electronic Dirac-like properties, resulting in flat bands at
magic angles. Inspired by the electronic model, we develop a continuum model
for the lattice dynamics of twisted bilayer graphene and we show that a
remarkable band flattening applies to almost all the high-frequency in-plane
lattice vibration modes, including the valley Dirac phonon, valley optical
phonon, and zone-center optical phonon bands. Utilizing an approximate
approach, we estimate small but finite magic angles at which a vanishing phonon
bandwidth is expected. In contrast to the electronic case, the existence of a
restoring potential prohibits the emergence of a magic angle in a more accurate
modeling. The predicted phonon band-flattening is highly tunable by the twist
angle and this strong dependence is directly accessible by spectroscopic tools.

Programmable quantum simulators such as superconducting quantum processors
and ultracold atomic lattices represent rapidly developing emergent technology
that may one day qualitatively outperform existing classical computers. Yet,
apart from a few breakthroughs, the range of viable computational applications
with current-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is still
significantly limited by gate errors, quantum decoherence and the number of
high quality qubits. In this work, we develop an approach that places NISQ
hardware as particularly suitable platforms for simulating multi-dimensional
condensed matter systems, including lattices beyond three dimensions which are
difficult to realize or probe in other settings. By fully exploiting the
exponentially large Hilbert space of a quantum chain, we encoded a
high-dimensional model in terms of non-local many-body interactions that can
further be systematically transcribed into quantum gates. We demonstrate the
power of our approach by realizing, on IBM transmon-based quantum computers,
higher-order topological states in up to four dimensions, which are exotic
phases that have never been realized in any quantum setting. With the aid of
in-house circuit compression and error mitigation techniques, we measured the
topological state dynamics and their protected midgap spectra to a high degree
of accuracy, as benchmarked by reference exact diagonalization data. The time
and memory needed with our approach scales favorably with system size and
dimensionality compared to exact diagonalization on classical computers.

<h3>Quantum geometry beyond projective single bands</h3>

The past few years have seen a revived interest in quantum geometrical
characterizations of band structures due to the rapid development of
topological insulators and semi-metals. Although the metric tensor has been
connected to many geometrical concepts for single bands, the exploration of
these concepts to a multi-band paradigm still promises a new field of interest.
Formally, multi-band systems, featuring in particular degeneracies, have been
related to projective spaces, explaining also the success of relating quantum
geometrical aspects of flat band systems, albeit usually in the single band
picture. Here, we propose a different route involving Pl\"ucker embeddings to
represent arbitrary classifying spaces, being the essential objects that encode
$all$ the relevant topology.This paradigm allows for the quantification of
geometrical quantities directly in readily manageable vector spaces that a
priori do not involve projectors or the need of flat band conditions. As a
result, our findings are shown to pave the way for identifying new geometrical
objects and defining metrics in arbitrary multi-band systems, especially beyond
the single flatband limit, promising a versatile tool that can be applied in
contexts that range from response theories to finding quantum volumes and
bounds on superfluid densities as well as possible quantum computations.

Localization marks the breakdown of thermalization in subregions of quantum
many-body systems in the presence of sufficiently large disorder. In this
paper, we use numerical techniques to study thermalization and localization in
a many-body system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators obtained by
discretizing a scalar quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime. We consider
a Gaussian initial state, constructed through a global mass quench, with a
quadratic Hamiltonian, and solve for the system's exact dynamics without and
with disorder in one and two spatial dimensions. We find that finite-size
systems localize for sufficiently large disorder in both cases, such that the
entanglement entropy of subregions retains its initial area-law behavior, and
the system no longer develops long-range correlations. To probe the
thermalization-to-localization transition further, we define a frequency gap
ratio that measures adjacent gaps in the phase space eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian and study how it varies with disorder strength and system size. We
find signatures of a chaotic regime at intermediate disorder in two spatial
dimensions and argue that it is a finite-size effect, such that the system
would localize for arbitrarily small disorder in the continuum in both one and
two spatial dimensions, consistent with Anderson localization. Lastly, we use
the frequency gap ratio to argue that in three spatial dimensions, on the other
hand, the system would only localize for disorder strengths above a critical
value in the continuum, again consistent with Anderson localization.

While the topological classification of matter has resulted in the prediction
and detection of unique topological phases in both insulators and metals,
materials that support an interplay between topology and interactions are
particularly interesting. We report the discovery that the topologically
non-trivial cubic double Dirac metal EuPd3S4 undergoes long-range charge
ordering at TCO = 340 K wherein Eu ions on a body-centered-cubic lattice divide
into interpenetrating simple cubic lattices, one occupied by magnetic Eu2+ the
other by non-magnetic Eu3+. The reduced symmetry transmutes the 8-fold double
Dirac states into 4-fold Dirac states and leads to the formation of an
isotropic simple cubic Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AFM) that subsequently
develops G-type AFM order at TN = 2.85(6) K. While time reversal symmetry is
broken at this second order phase transition, its combination with the nearest
neighbor lattice translation forms a non-symmorphic symmetry operation that
preserves the 4-fold Dirac point. Application of a magnetic field at low
temperatures yields a spin flop transition followed by a fully magnetized
charge ordered state. Our work demonstrates how the collective phenomena of
charge and spin ordering in EuPd3S4 modify electronic topology and provides a
full experimental view of the field-temperature phase diagram of the simple
cubic Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

We describe a scheme to exchange fermion parity between two pairs of Majorana
bound states mediated by coupling with a centralized quantum dot. We
specifically formulate such a scheme for Majorana bound states nucleated in the
Josephson vortices formed in a four-fold crossroads junction of planar
topological superconductors in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field.
This platform yields several advantages to the execution of our scheme as
compared to similar ideas proposed in wire geometries, including control over
the positions of the MBS and hence, a tunable coupling with the quantum dot. We
show that moving the MBS along the junctions through voltage pulses can
facilitate parity exchange via a two-step process, with intermediate projective
measurements of the quantum dot charge. Thus, we formulate a way to achieve
single qubit operations for MBS in extended Josephson junctions through
projective measurements of quantum dot charge. We also discuss the physical
viability of our scheme with a particular focus on changes in quantum dot
energy levels as a measurable indicator of the success of the scheme.

Renormalization is a powerful technique in statistical physics to extract the
large-scale behavior of interacting many-body models. These notes aim to give
an introduction to perturbative methods that operate on the level of the
stochastic evolution equation for a scalar field (e.g., density), including
systems that are driven away from equilibrium and thus lack a free energy.
While there is a large number of reviews and lecture notes, many are somewhat
scarce on technical details and written in the language of quantum field
theory, which can be more confusing than helpful. Here we attempt a minimal and
concise yet pedagogical introduction to dynamic renormalization in the language
of statistical physics with a strong focus on how to actually perform
calculations. We provide a symbolic algebra implementation of the discussed
techniques including Jupyter notebooks of two illustrations: the KPZ equation
and a neural network model.

Mixed halide chemistry has recently been utilized to tune the intrinsic
magnetic properties of transition-metal halides $-$ one of the largest families
of magnetic van der Waals materials. Prior studies have shown that the strength
of exchange interactions, hence the critical temperature, can be tuned smoothly
with halide composition for a given ground-state. Here we show that the
ground-state itself can be altered by a small change of halide composition
leading to a quantum phase transition in FeCl$_{3-x}$Br$_x$. Specifically, we
find a three-fold jump in the N\'{e}el temperature and a sign change in the
Weiss temperature at $x= 0.08$ corresponding to only $3\%$ bromine doping.
Using neutron scattering, we reveal a change of the ground-state from spiral
order in FeCl$_3$ to A-type antiferromagnetic order in FeBr$_3$. Using
first-principles calculations, we show that a delicate balance between nearest
and next-nearest neighbor interactions is responsible for such a transition.
These results support the proximity of FeCl$_3$ to a spiral spin liquid state,
in which competing interactions and nearly degenerate magnetic $k$-vectors may
cause large changes in response to small perturbations.

We compute from first principles the electronic, vibrational, and transport
properties of four known MXenes compound : Ti3C2, Ti3C2F2, Ti3C2(OH)2, and
Ti2CF2. We study the effect of different surface terminations and monosheet
thickness on the electrical conductivity, and show that the changes in
conductivity can be explained by the squared velocity density of the electronic
state, as well as their phonon scattering lifetime. We also compare the
solution of the iterative Boltzmann transport equation (IBTE) to different
linearized solutions, namely, the self-energy relaxation time approximation
(SERTA) and the momentum relaxation time approximation (MRTA), and we show that
the SERTA significantly underestimates the electrical conductivity while the
MRTA yields results in better agreement with the IBTE.

Strong singularities in the electronic density of states amplify correlation
effects and play a key role in determining the ordering instabilities in
various materials. Recently high order van Hove singularities (VHSs) with
diverging power-law scaling have been classified in single-band electron
models. We show that the 110 surface of Bismuth exhibits high order VHS with
unusually high exponent of -0.7. Detailed mapping of the surface band structure
using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy shows that this
singularity occurs in close proximity with Dirac bands located at the center of
the surface Brillouin zone. The enhanced power-law divergence is shown to
originate from the anisotropic flattening of the Dirac band just above the
Dirac node. Such near-coexistence of massless Dirac electrons and ultra-massive
saddle points enables to study the interplay of high order VHS and Dirac
fermions.

<h3>Optical Conductivity Signatures of Floquet Electronic Phases</h3>

<br>
Optical conductivity measurements may provide access to distinct signatures
of Floquet electronic phases, which are described theoretically by their
quasienergy band structures. Here, we focus on characterizing experimental
observables of the Floquet graphene antidot lattice, which we introduced
previously [Phys. Rev. B 104, 174304 (2021)]. On the basis of Floquet linear
response theory, the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and Hall
optical conductivity are computed as a function of probe frequency. We find
that the number and positions of peaks in the response function are distinctive
of the different Floquet electronic phases, and identify multiple properties
with no equilibrium analog. First, for several intervals of probe frequencies,
the real part of the conductivity becomes negative, which we argue is
indicative of negative Joule heating. That is, the Floquet drive causes the
material to amplify the power of the probe (gain). Additionally, while there is
zero Hall response at equilibrium, the real and imaginary parts of the Floquet
Hall conductivity are non-zero and can be as large as the longitudinal
components. Lastly, driving-induced localization tends to reduce the overall
magnitude of and to flatten out the optical conductivity signal. From an
implementation standpoint, a major advantage of the antidot lattice is that the
above-bandwidth driving limit is reached with photon energies that are at least
twenty times lower than that required for the intrinsic material, allowing for
significant band renormalization at orders-of-magnitude smaller intensities.
Our work provides the necessary tools for experimentalists to map reflectance
data to particular Floquet phases for this novel material.

Understanding many-electron phenomena with competing near-degenerate
electronic states is of fundamental importance to chemistry and condensed
matter physics. One of the most significant challenges for exploring such
many-electron phenomena is the necessity for large system sizes in order to
realize competing states, far beyond those practical for first-principles
methods. Here, we show how allowing non-integer nuclear charges expands the
space of computationally tractable electron systems that host competing
electronic states. The emergence of competing electronic states from
non-integer nuclear charges is exemplified in the simple 2-electron H_{2}
molecule and used to examine the microscopic structure of doped quasi-1D
cuprate chains, showing how non-integer nuclear charges can open a window for
first-principles calculations of difficult many-electron phenomena.

<br>
<br>
We provide an intuitive understanding of the collective low-energy spin
excitation of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain,
known as the spinon. To this end, we demonstrate that a single spinon can be
excited by adding one extra spin to the ground state wave function of the
Heisenberg chain with an even number of sites. This procedure accurately
reproduces all key features of the spinon's dispersion, and provides a natural
explanation for its spin-1/2. Next, we show that the spinon dispersion can be
approximately reproduced if we replace the true ground state with the simplest
valence-bond solid. This proves that the spinon of the one-dimensional
Heisenberg model can be understood as a single spin flowing through a
valence-bond solid.

Quantum algorithmics with single spins poses serious technological challenges
such as precision fabrication, rapid decoherence, atomic-scale addressing and
readout. To circumvent atomic-scale challenges, we examine the case of fully
polarized mesoscopic spin ensembles (spin-coherent states) whose total angular
momenta states map to qudit submanifolds. We show that in the limit where the
size of the ensembles is small compared to their separation, it is possible to
treat them as qubits with an effective coupling strength that scales with the
number of spins. If the spins within each ensemble are decoupled (e.g., via
control fields, spinning or diffusional averaging or materials engineering),
one- and two-qubit gate operations can be implemented with high fidelities.

<h3>Kanamori-Moiré-Hubbard model for transition metal dichalcogenide  homobilayers</h3>

Ab-initio and continuum model studies predicted that the $\Gamma$ valley
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers could simulate the
conventional multi-orbital Hubbard model on the moir\'e Honeycomb lattice.
Here, we perform the Wannierization starting from the continuum model and show
that a more general Kanamori-Moir\'e-Hubbard model emerges, beyond the
extensively studied standard multi-orbital Hubbard model, which can be used to
investigate the many-body physics in the $\Gamma$ valley TMD homobilayers.
Using the unrestricted Hartree-Fock and Lanczos techniques, we study these
half-filled multi-orbital moir\'e bands. By constructing the phase diagrams we
predict the presence of an antiferromagnetic state and in addition we found
unexepected and dominant states, such as a S = 1 ferromagnetic insulator and a
charge density wave state. Our theoretical predictions made using this model
can be tested in future experiments on the $\Gamma$ valley TMD homobilayers.

We have conducted a detailed high-pressure investigation on $Eu-$doped
$BaTiO_3$ using angle-resolved x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
dielectric permittivity and dc resistance measurements. The x-ray diffraction
data analysis shows a structural transition from the ambient tetragonal to the
mixed (cubic + tetragonal) phase above 1.4 GPa pressure. The tetragonality due
to the internal deformation of the $TiO_6$ octahedra caused by a charge
difference cannot be lifted upon by pressure. Softening, weakening, and
disappearance of low-frequency Raman modes indicate ferroelectric tetragonal to
the paraelectric cubic phase transition. But the pressure-induced increase in
the intensity of [E(LO), A1(LO)] and the octahedral breathing modes indicate
the local structural inhomogeneity remains in the crystal and is responsible
for spontaneous polarization in the sample. Low-frequency electronic scattering
response suggests the pressure-induced carrier delocalization, leading to a
metallic state in the system. We speculate the presence of localized
microscopic ferroelectric ordering in the system at high pressure from
dielectric constant and dc resistance measurements. Our results suggest
high-pressure phase coexistence leads to a ferroelectric-like metallic state in
the sample.

<h3>Highly Efficient Hydrogen Storage of Sc Decorated Biphenylene Monolayer  near Ambient-temperature: An Ab-initio Simulation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The energy demands for the growing development of society need to be catered
with alternative and green fuels like hydrogen energy for a lasting and
sustainable culture. One essential component of the hydrogen economy is the
efficiency of its storage. We have studied the hydrogen-storage capability on a
recently synthesized Biphenylene (BPh) decorated with Sc using the
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) techniques. Scandium attaches BPh sheet strongly with binding
energy -3.84 eV, and single Sc decorated on BPh can absorb a maximum of five
H$_2$ molecules resulting in a high gravimetric weight percentage of 11.07,
which is significantly higher than DoE's ultimate criteria (6.5 wt%). Using
van't Hoff equation, strongly and weakly attached hydrogens correspond to
desorption temperatures of 200 K and 397 K with an average of 305 K. The high
binding of Sc to BPh is due to charge donation of 3d orbital of Sc to 2p
orbital of C. The interactions between absorbed H$_2$ and BPh+Sc are due to
charge transfer from 3d-orbital of Sc to ${\sigma}$* bond of H$_2$ molecules
and backdonation from ${\sigma}$ bond of H$_2$ to empty 3d-orbital of Sc known
as Kubas type interaction. Furthermore, phonon and AIMD simulation confirm
BPh+Sc stability, and the presence of an energy barrier shows no probability of
Sc-Sc clustering on BPh. So theoretically stable BPh+Sc showing high
gravimetric weight percentage with an average 305 K desorption temperature,
might be a potential candidate for solidstage hydrogen devices.

All-$d$ Heuslers are a category of novel compounds combining versatile
functionalities such as caloric responses and spintronics with enhanced
mechanical properties. Despite the promising transport properties (anomalous
Hall (AHC) and anomalous Nernst (ANC) conductivities) shown in the conventional
Co$_2$XY Heuslers with $p$-$d$ hybridization, the all-$d$ Heuslers with only
$d$-$d$ hybridization open a new horizon to search for new candidates with
outstanding transport properties. In this work, we evaluate the AHC and ANC for
thermodynamically stable ferro/ferri-magnetic all-$d$-metal regular Heusler
compounds based on high-throughput first-principles calculations. It is
observed that quite a few materials exhibit giant AHCs and ANCs, such as cubic
Re$_2$TaMn with an AHC of 2011 S/cm, and tetragonal Pt$_2$CrRh with an AHC of
1966 S/cm and an ANC of 7.50 A/mK. Comprehensive analysis on the electronic
structure reveals that the high AHC can be attributed to the occurrence of the
Weyl nodes or gapped nodal lines in the neighbourhood of the Fermi level. The
correlations between such transport properties and the number of valence
electrons are also thoroughly investigated, which provides a practical guidance
to tailor AHC and ANC via chemical doping for transverse thermoelectric
applications.

Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) is one of most competitive photovoltaic materials
for its earth-abundant reserves, environmental friendliness, and high
stability.The quality of CZTSSe absorber determines the power-conversion
efficiency (PCE) of CZTSSe solar cells. The absorber's quality lies on
post-selenization process, which is the reaction of Cu-Zn-Sn precursor and
selenium vapor. And the post-selenization is dependent on various factors (e.g.
temperature, precursor composition, reaction atmosphere, etc).However,
synergistic regulation of these factors cannot be realized under a widely-used
single-temperature zone selenization condition.Here, in our dual-temperature
zone selenization scheme, a solid-liquid and solid-gas (solid precursor and
liquid/gas phase Se) synergistic reaction strategy has been developed to
precisely regulate the selenization. Pre-deposited excess liquid Se provides
high Se chemical potential to drive a direct and fast formation of the CZTSSe
phase, significantly reducing the amount of binary and ternary compounds within
phase evolution. And organics removal can be accomplished via a synergistic
optimization of Se condensation and subsequent volatilization. We achieve a
high-performance CZTSSe solar cell with a remarkable PCE of 13.6%, and the
highest large-area PCE of 12.0% (over 1cm2). Our strategy will provide a new
idea for further improving efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells via phase evolution
regulation, and also for other complicated multi-compound synthesis.

Resummation methods using continued functions are implemented to converge

<br>
<br>
We perform extensive simulations and systematic statistical analyses of the
structural dynamics of amorphous silicon. The simulations follow the dynamics
introduced by Wooten, Winer and Weaire: the energy is obtained with the Keating
potential, and the dynamics consists of bond transpositions proposed at random
locations and accepted with the Metropolis acceptance ratio. The structural
quantities we track are the variations in time of the lateral lengths
($L_x$,$L_y$,$L_z$) of the cuboid simulation cell. We transform these
quantities into the volume $V$ and two aspect ratios $B_1$ and $B_2$. Our
analysis reveals that at short times, the mean squared displacement (MSD) for
all of them exhibits normal diffusion. At longer times, they cross over to
anomalous diffusion, with a temperature-dependent anomalous exponent
$\alpha<1$. We analyze our findings in the light of two standard models in
statistical physics that feature anomalous dynamics, $viz.$, continuous time
random walker (CTRW) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm). We obtain the
distribution of waiting times, and find that the data are consistent with a
stretched-exponential decay. We also show that the three quantities, $V$, $B_1$
and $B_2$ exhibit negative velocity autocorrelation functions. These
observations together suggest that the dynamics of the material belong to the
fBm class.

Scattering of superconducting pairs by magnetic impurities on a
superconducting surface leads to pairs of sharp in-gap resonances, known as
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states. Similarly to the interference of itinerant
electrons scattered on defects in normal metals, these resonances reveal a
periodic texture around the magnetic impurity. However, the wavelength of these
resonances was often too short to be resolved even by methods capable of atomic
resolution, like STM. Here, we combine a CO molecule with a superconducting
cluster pre-attached to an STM tip to maximize both spatial and energy
resolution. The superior properties of such a double-functionalized probe are
demonstrated by imaging the interference of YSR states around magnetic Fe
dimers on a Nb(110) surface. Our novel approach reveals rich interference
patterns of both the even and odd combinations of the hybridized YSR states,
which are inaccessible with conventional STM probes.

The non-equilibrium dynamics of disordered many-body quantum systems after a
global quantum quench unveils important insights about the competition between
interactions and disorder, yielding in particular an insightful perspective on
many body localization (MBL). Still, the experimentally relevant effect of bond
randomness in long-range interacting spin chains on the quantum quench dynamics
have so far not been investigated. In this letter, we examine the entanglement
entropy growth after a global quench in a quantum spin chain with randomly
placed spins and long-range tunable interactions decaying with distance with
power $\alpha$. Using a dynamical version of the strong disorder
renormalization group (SDRG) we find for $\alpha >\alpha_c$ that the
entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with time and becomes smaller with
larger $\alpha$ as $S(t) = S_p \ln(t)/(2\alpha)$. Here, $S_p= 2 \ln2 -1$. We
use numerical exact diagonalization (ED) simulations to verify our results for
system sizes up to $ N\sim 16$ spins, yielding good agreement for sufficiently
large $\alpha > \alpha_c \approx 1.8$. For $\alpha<\alpha_c$, we find that the
entanglement entropy grows as a power-law with time, $S(t)\sim
t^{\gamma(\alpha)}$ with $0<\gamma(\alpha)<1$ a decaying function of the
interaction exponent $\alpha$.

Understanding properties in out-of-equilibrium many-body quantum systems is
an essential task in modern physics. While cutting-edge numerical methods have
been developed, extracting the universal dynamics of generic many-body quantum
systems remains a big challenge. The multi-channel Kondo impurity (MCKI) model,
one of the exotic phases of matter that hosts an over-screened Kondo state with
non-Fermi liquid properties, provides a platform for theoretically studying the
universal properties of quantum dynamics in many-body systems. By using the
large-N Schwinger-Keldysh approach, we systematically investigate transient
dynamics and long-time thermalization properties in MCKI under a sudden change
of the Kondo coupling. We observe general oscillation patterns with a universal
frequency in physical quantities for the initial state being over-screened
Kondo state under the sudden quench while the no oscillations for the initial
state being a high-temepreature Fermi liquid state due to the de-phasing.
Additionally, we find that the equilibration of the system heavily depends on
the initial state and the quench protocol. On top of the numerical analysis, we
also provide a phenomenological analysis for the equilibration using the
quantum Boltzmann equation. Our approach sheds light on the universal
properties of quantum dynamics and offers deeper insights into quantum
thermalization.

plasticity modeling framework, $\rho$-CP. A Kocks-type thermally activated flow
is used for accounting for the temperature and strain rate effects on the
crystallograpphic shearing rate. Slip system-level mobile and immobile
dislocation densities, as well slip system-level backstress, are used as
internal state variables for representing the substructure evolution during
plastic deformation. A fully implicit numerical integration scheme is presented
for the time integration of the finite deformation plasticity model. The
framework is implemented and integrated with the open source finite element
solver, Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). Example
applications of the model are demonstrated for predicting the anisotropic
mechanical response of single and polycrystalline hcp magnesium, strain rate
effects and cyclic deformation of polycrystalline fcc OFHC copper, and
temperature and strain rate effects on the thermo-mechanical deformation of
polycrystalline bcc tantanlum. Simulations of realistic Voronoi-tessellated
microstructures as well as Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD)
microstructures are demonstrated to highlight the model's ability to predict
large deformation and misorientation developement during plastic deformation.

Existing flexible electronics are planar, nonbreathable, and easily damaged.
In this work, authors introduce a new paradigm of free-form three-dimensional
integrated circuits assembled on a single textile thread for ultimate
flexibility. Transistors are assembled as daisy chain on a thread and utilize
deep eutectic solvent gels, or eutectogels as nonvolatile, breathable, and
repairable dielectric for gating organic electrochemical transistor. The
eutectogels provide stable transistor performance without the need for
encapsulation, are air permeable to the skin, and make the Organic Eutectogel
Gated Electrochemical Transistor (OEGET) a promising candidate for wearable
electronics. Complex analog integrated circuits, such as single stage and
multi-stage amplifiers can be realized on a single thread which can bend out of
the plane of stretching for true three-dimensional flexibility. An all-thread
based wearable that uses a thread-based strain sensor and thread-based
integrated circuit for eye motion and respiration monitoring is also presented.

We introduce a numerical linked cluster expansion for square-lattice models
whose building block is an L-shape cluster. This expansion exhibits a similar
or better convergence of the bare sums than that of the (larger) square-shaped
clusters, and can be used with resummation techniques (like the site- and
bond-based expansions) to obtain results at even lower temperatures. We compare
the performance of weak- and strong-embedding versions of this expansion in
spin-1/2 models, and show that the strong-embedding version is preferable
because of its convergence properties and lower computational cost. Finally, we
show that the expansion based on the L-shape cluster can be naturally used to
study properties of lattice models that smoothly connect the square and
triangular lattice geometries.

<h3>Hidden synaptic structures control collective network dynamics</h3>

A common approach to model local neural circuits is to assume random
connectivity. But how is our choice of randomness informed by known network
properties? And how does it affect the network's behavior? Previous approaches
have focused on prescribing increasingly sophisticated statistics of synaptic
strengths and motifs. However, at the same time experimental data on parallel
dynamics of neurons is readily accessible. We therefore propose a complementary
approach, specifying connectivity in the space that directly controls the
dynamics - the space of eigenmodes. We develop a theory for a novel ensemble of
large random matrices, whose eigenvalue distribution can be chosen arbitrarily.
We show analytically how varying such distribution induces a diverse range of
collective network behaviors, including power laws that characterize the
dimensionality, principal components spectrum, autocorrelation, and
autoresponse of neuronal activity. The power-law exponents are controlled by
the density of nearly critical eigenvalues, and provide a minimal and robust
measure to directly link observable dynamics and connectivity. The density of
nearly critical modes also characterizes a transition from high to low
dimensional dynamics, while their maximum oscillation frequency determines a
transition from an exponential to power-law decay in time of the correlation
and response functions. We prove that the wide range of dynamical behaviors
resulting from the proposed connectivity ensemble is caused by structures that
are invisible to a motif analysis. Their presence is captured by motifs
appearing with vanishingly small probability in the number of neurons. Only
reciprocal motifs occur with finite probability. In other words, a motif
analysis can be blind to synaptic structures controlling the dynamics, which
instead become apparent in the space of eigenmode statistics.

In this work, we develop a nanoscale magnetic field sensor based on a
spin-Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) device. We fabricate constriction-based SHNO
devices using Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/Au$_{0.25}$Pt$_{0.75}$ bilayer and use them to
demonstrate quasi-DC sensing up to kilohertz-scale frequencies under a bias
field of 400 Oe in the sample plane. The magnetic field sensing is based on the
linear dependence of SHNO oscillation frequency on external magnetic field. The
detectivity of the sensor is as low as 0.21 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ at 100
Hz, with an effective sensing area of 0.32 $\mu$m$^2$, making SHNO devices
suitable for scanning probe nanoscale magnetometry.

<h3>Kondo effect in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

The emergence of flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene at the magic angle
can be understood in terms of a vanishing Fermi velocity of the Dirac cone.
This is associated with van Hove singularities approaching the Fermi energy and
becoming higher-order. In the density of states this is reflected by flanking
logarithmic van Hove divergences pinching off the central Dirac cone in energy
space. The low-energy pseudogap of the Dirac cone away from the magic angle is
replaced by a power-law divergence due to the higher-order van Hove singularity
at the magic angle.
This plays an important role in the exotic phenomena observed in this
material, such as superconductivity and magnetism, by amplifying electronic
correlation effects. Here we investigate one such correlation effect -- the
Kondo effect due to a magnetic impurity embedded in twisted bilayer graphene.
We use the Bistritzer-MacDonald model to extract the low-energy density of
states of the material as a function of twist angle, and study the resulting
quantum impurity physics using perturbative and numerical renormalization group
methods. Although at zero temperature the impurity is only Kondo screened
precisely at the magic angle, we find highly nontrivial behavior at finite
temperatures relevant to experiment, due to the complex interplay between
Dirac, van Hove, and Kondo physics.

<h3>Practical Strategies for Enhancing the Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe  Quantum Wells</h3>

Silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructures have many important advantages for
hosting spin qubits. However, controlling the energy splitting between the two
low-energy conduction-band valleys remains a critical challenge for scaling up
to large numbers of reliable qubits. Broad distributions of valley splittings
are commonplace, even among quantum dots formed on the same chip. Such behavior
has previously been attributed to imperfections such as steps at the quantum
well interface. The most common approaches for addressing this problem have
sought to engineer design improvements into the quantum well. In this work, we
develop a simple, universal theory of valley splitting based on the
reciprocal-space profile of the quantum well confinement potential, which
simultaneously explains the effects of steps, wide interfaces, alloy disorder,
and custom heterostructure designs. We use this understanding to characterize
theoretically the valley splitting in a variety of heterostructures, finding
that alloy disorder can explain the observed variability of the valley
splitting, even in the absence of steps. Moreover we show that steps have a
significant effect on the valley splitting only when the top interface is very
sharp. We predict a universal crossover from a regime where low valley
splittings are rare to a regime dominated by alloy disorder, in which valley
splittings can approach zero. We show that many recent experiments fall into
the latter category, with important implications for large-scale qubit
implementations. We finally propose a strategy to suppress the incidence of low
valley splittings by (i) increasing the random alloy disorder (to increase the
valley splitting variance), and then (ii) allowing for electrostatic tuning of
the dot position (to access locations with higher valley splitting).

Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) show promise in accurately
describing the physical properties of materials, but there is a need for a
higher throughput method of validation. Here, we demonstrate using that MLIPs
and molecular dynamics can accurately capture the potential energy landscape
and lattice dynamics that are needed to describe electron thermal diffuse
scattering. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a test-bed at cryogenic and room temperatures,
we compare electron thermal diffuse scattering simulations using different
approximations to incorporate thermal motion. Only when the simulations are
based on quantum mechanically accurate MLIPs in combination with path-integral
molecular dynamics that include nuclear quantum effects, there is excellent
agreement with experiment\end{abstract}

Flat band systems are currently under intense investigation in quantum
materials, optical lattices, and metamaterials. These efforts are motivated by
potential realization of strongly correlated phenomena enabled by
frustration-induced flat band dispersions; identification of candidate
platforms plays an important role in these efforts. Here, we develop a
high-throughput materials search for bulk crystalline flat bands by automated
construction of uniform-hopping near-neighbor tight binding models. We show
that this approach captures many of the essential features relevant to
identifying flat band lattice motifs in candidate materials in a
computationally inexpensive manner. We apply this algorithm to 139,367
materials in the Materials Project database and identify 63,076 materials that
host at least one flat band elemental sublattice. We further categorize these
candidate systems into at least 31,635 unique flat band crystal nets and
identify candidates of interest from both lattice and band structure
perspectives. This work expands the number of known flat band lattices that
exist in physically realizable crystal structures and classifies the majority
of these systems by the underlying lattice, providing new insights for familiar
(e.g. kagome, pyrochlore, Lieb, and dice) as well as previously unknown motifs.

Two-dimensional (2D) indium monoselenide (InSe) has attracted significant
attention as a III-VI two-dimensional semiconductor (2D) with a combination of
favorable attributes from III-V semiconductors as well as van der Waals 2D
transition metal dichalcogenides. Nevertheless, the large-area synthesis of
phase-pure 2D InSe remains unattained due to the complexity of the binary In-Se
system and the difficulties in promoting lateral growth. Here, we report the
first polymorph-selective synthesis of epitaxial 2D InSe by metal-organic
chemical deposition (MOCVD) over 2 inch diameter sapphire wafers. We achieve
thickness-controlled, layer-by-layer epitaxial growth of InSe on c-plane
sapphire via dynamic pulse control of Se/In flux ratio. The layer-by-layer
growth allows thickness control over wafer scale with tunable optical
properties comparable to bulk crystals. Finally, the gate-tunable electrical
transport suggests that MOCVD-grown InSe could be a potential channel material
for back-end-of-line integration in logic transistors with field-effect
mobility comparable to single-crystalline flakes.

Rare-earth silicates are the current standard material for use as
environmental barrier coatings for SiC-based ceramic matrix composites as
hot-section components in gas-turbine engines. Expanding the design space to
all available rare-earth elements to facilitate optimizing functionality
requires an understanding of systematic trends in $RE_2$Si$_2$O$_7$ properties.
In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with experimental
measurements of Young's modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, and thermal
conductivity for a range of different $RE_2$Si$_2$O$_7$ compositions and
phases. Clear trends are observed in these properties as a function of the
radius of the rare-earth cation. In the case of Young's modulus and thermal
expansion, these trends also hold for multi-component systems; while the
thermal conductivity of multi-component systems is noticeably lower, indicating
the potential of such materials to also act as thermal barriers. These results
provide design rules for developing new thermal and environmental barrier
coatings with stiffness and thermal expansion engineered to match that of the
substrate, while simultaneously having reduced thermal conductivity.

<h3>Indirect Exchange Interaction Leads to Large Lattice Contribution to  Magnetocaloric Entropy Change</h3>

Materials with a large magnetocaloric response are highly desirable for
magnetic cooling applications. It is suggested that a strong spin-lattice
coupling tends to generate a large magnetocaloric effect, but no microscopic
mechanism has been proposed. In this work, we use spin lattice dynamics
simulation to examine the lattice contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy
change in bcc iron (Fe) and hcp gadolinium (Gd) with exchange interaction
parameters determined from ab initio calculations. We find that indirect
Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) exchange interaction in hcp Gd leads to
longer range spin lattice coupling and more strongly influences the low
frequency long wavelength phonons. This results in a higher lattice
contribution towards the total magnetocaloric entropy change as compared to bcc
Fe with short range direct exchange interactions. Our analysis provides a
framework for understanding the magnetocaloric effect in magnetic materials
with strong spin lattice couplings. Our finding suggests that long range
indirect RKKY type exchange gives rise to a larger lattice contribution to the
magnetocaloric entropy change and is, thus, beneficial for magnetocaloric
materials.

An anomalously high valence state sometimes shows up in transition-metal
oxide compounds. Holes tend to occupy mainly the ligand $p$ orbitals, giving
rise to interesting physical properties such as superconductivity in cuprates
and rich magnetic phases in ferrates. However, no one has ever observed the
distribution of ligand holes in real space. Here, we report a successful
observation of the spatial distribution of valence electrons in cubic
perovskite SrFeO$_3$ by high-energy X-ray diffraction experiments and precise
electron density analysis using a core differential Fourier synthesis method. A
real-space picture of ligand holes formed by the orbital hybridization of Fe

We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of magnetic excitations
in YbMnSb2, a low-carrier-density Dirac semimetal in which the
antiferromagnetic Mn layers are interleaved with Sb layers that host Dirac
fermions. We observe a considerable broadening of spin waves, which is
consistent with substantial spin fermion coupling. The spin wave damping,
$\gamma$, in YbMnSb2 is roughly twice larger compared to that in a sister
material, YbMnBi2, where an indication of a small damping consistent with
theoretical analysis of the spin-fermion coupling was reported. The inter-plane
interaction between the Mn layers in YbMnSb2 is also much stronger, suggesting
that the interaction mechanism is rooted in the same spin-fermion coupling. Our
results establish the systematics of spin-fermion interactions in layered
magnetic Dirac materials.

Here we report a combined study of low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) on PdCrO$_2$, a
delafossite metal with an antiferromagnetic order below ~37.5 K. First, on the
CrO$_2$-terminated polar surface we detect a gap-like feature both below and
above the N\'eel temperature. The DMFT calculations indicate that this gap is
opened due to the strong correlations of Cr-3d electrons, suggesting the hidden
Mott nature of the gap. Then, we observe two kinds of Pd-terminated polar
surfaces. One is a well-ordered Pd surface with the
Fermi-surface-nesting-induced incommensurate charge modulation, while the other
one is a reconstructed Pd surface with the individual nano-scale non-periodic
domain structures. On the well-ordered Pd surface, the interference between the
incommensurate charge modulation and the atomic lattice forms the periodic
moir\'e pattern. Our results provide important microscopic information for
fully understanding the correlated electronic properties of this class of
materials.

The harmonic approximation of ionic fluctuations and the linear coupling
between phonons and electrons provide the basic approach to compute, from first
principles, the contribution that the nuclei dynamics and its interaction with
electrons have on materials' properties. These approaches are questionable, at
least, whenever quantum and anharmonic effects on the nuclei vibrational
properties are large, such as in hydrogenous systems, high-$T_c$
superconductors, and when systems are close to displacive phase transitions.
Here we propose a novel non-perturbative approach to compute the
electron-phonon interaction from first principles that includes non-linear
effects and takes into account the quantum nature of nuclei. The method is
based on the $GW^{(en)}$ approximation for the electron self-energy, given by
the effective nuclei-mediated electron-electron interaction $W^{(en)}$ and the
electron Green's function $G$. The electrons are treated at a mean-field level
and the nuclei dynamics is described with a Gaussian distribution function,
which can effectively take into account anharmonic effects at a mean-field
level, e.g. within the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Pivotal
quantities of the Gaussian $GW^{(en)}$ self-energy are the renormalized average
vertices, which are computed in supercells with a stochastic approach, using
the the self-consistent electronic potential computed for different atomic
configurations. In order to validate the method, $GW^{(en)}$ calculations are
performed on aluminum, a highly harmonic system with weak electron-phonon
coupling. The obtained results coincide with the ones obtained with standard
linear electron-phonon calculations. However, calculations performed on
palladium hydride, a very anharmonic system, show a highly non-linear
electron-phonon interaction, with $GW^{(en)}$ bringing corrections as high as
the linear-order result.

THz magnetization dynamics is a key property of antiferromagnets as well as
ferrimagnets that could harness the THz forefront and spintronics. While most
of the present THz measurement techniques are for bulk materials whose
sensitivities rely on the volume of the material, measurement techniques
suitable for thin films are quite limited. In this study, we explored and
demonstrated electrical detection of the antiferromagnetic dynamics in
ferrimagnetic Gd-Co thin films by using a 154 GHz gyrotron, a high-power
electromagnetic wave source. Captured resonant modes allow us to characterize
the peculiar magnetization dynamics of the Gd-Co around the net angular
momentum compensation. As the gyrotron frequency is scalable up to THz, our
demonstration can be an important milestone toward the THz measurements for
antiferro- and ferri- magnetic thin films.

A novel light-sensitive chiral dopant ChD-3816 (an azo compound containing
4-hexanoyloxyphenyl and 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexylbenzoate moieties) was
used for inducing helical twisting in Ntb-forming mixtures of CB7CB/CB6OCB with
5CB added to decrease the phase transition temperatures. The effects of
ChD-3816 upon phase transition temperatures, as well as effects of its
concentration on the measured values of helical twisting were determined. Most
of the measured parameters could be varied due to light-induced trans-cis
isomerization of ChD-3816. Under electric field, selective reflection spectra
in the visible range were obtained for the emerging ChOH structures, with the
wavelengths controllable both by electric field and appropriate UV irradiation.
Possible applications for dynamic formation of contrast images are discussed.

Skyrmions are topologically protected quantum objects at the nanometre scale.
They form perpendicular to an applied magnetic field at a certain temperature
and arrange themselves in a typically hexagonal lattice. Using small angle
neutron scattering we have determined the magnetic field versus temperature
phase diagrams of the stability range of the different magnetic phases, the
helical as well as the skyrmion phases in the multiferroic skyrmion material
Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Therefore, a single crystal was mounted in different crystal
orientations, i.e. unoriented and with the crystallographic $\langle1 1
0\rangle$ and $\langle1 0 0\rangle$ axis aligned parallel to the magnetic
field. Furthermore, different cooling procedures were tested, cooling from the
paramagnetic phase at zero magnetic field and field cooling through the
skyrmion phase where metastable skyrmions are nucleated. From this, not only
were the stability ranges of both the helical and skyrmion phases in this
multiferroic skyrmion material determined, but the length of the spin helix and
the skyrmion distances at different conditions was also determined through
detailed analysis of the positions of the observed Bragg peaks. The obtained
data provide valuable information about the scaling of the skyrmion distances
and therefore their packing density. The knowledge about this tunability will
serve as an important input for the theoretical understanding of the formation
of skyrmions. Concerning technological applications, for example as
high-density data storage devices in information technology, the temperature
and magnetic field dependence of the packing density of skyrmions is of
critical importance for their design. Therefore, the obtained knowledge is an
essential input for future skyrmionics applications in high-density data
storage, in low-energy spintronics or in skyrmionics quantum computation.

Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a faithful reformulation of the
physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as a topological heavy
fermion problem, involving the hybridization of flat band f-electrons with a
topological band of conduction electrons. Here we explore the consequences of
this analogy, using it to reformulate the SB model as a mixed valence model for
twisted bilayer graphene. We show how the interaction with the conduction sea
behaves as a U(8) Kondo Lattice at high energies and a U(4) Kondo lattice at
low energies. One of the robust consequences of the model, is the prediction
that underlying hybridization scale of the mixed valent model and the the width
of the upper and lower Hubbard bands will scale linearly with energy. We also
find that the bare hybridization $\gamma_{0}$ predicted by the SB model is too
large to account for the observed local moment behavior at large filling
factor, leading us to suggest that the bare hybridization is renormalized by
the soft polaronic response of the underlying graphene.

The ability to change significantly mechanical and wave propagation
properties of a structure without rebuilding it has been one of the main
challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the
enormous appeal that, especially in the case of micro-scale systems, such
tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from
biomedical to protective devices. In this work, a novel micro-scale mechanical
metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of
configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative
Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a
highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps, at the
same time, can be controlled, which can be very useful in the design of
vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is shown experimentally that
reconfiguration of the system, leading to a change in its properties, can be
induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field, thanks
to appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

We investigate the scattering theory of two particles in a generic

connect the Fourier transform ${\tilde V}(k)$ of the interaction potential to
the s-wave phase shift. In this way we obtain explicit expressions of the
low-momentum parameters ${\tilde g}_0$ and ${\tilde g}_2$ of ${\tilde
V}(k)={\tilde g}_0+{\tilde g}_2k^2 +...$ in terms of the s-wave scattering
length $a_s$ and the s-wave effective range $r_s$ for $D=3$, $D=2$, and $D=1$.
Our results, which are strongly dependent on the spatial dimension $D$, are a
useful benchmark for few-body and many-body calculations. As a specific
application, we derive the zero-temperature pressure of a 2D uniform
interacting Bose gas with a beyond-mean-field correction which includes both
scattering length and effective range.

The study of topologically ordered states have given rise to a growing
interest in symmetry protected states in quantum matter. Recently, this theory
has been extended to quantum many body systems which demonstrate ordered states
at low temperature. An example of this is the discrete time crystal (DTC) which
has been demonstrated in a real quantum computer and in driven systems. These
states are periodic in time and are protected to disorder to a certain extent.
In general, DTC can be classified into two phases, the stable many body
localization (MBL) state, and the disordered thermal state. This work
demonstrates by generalizing DTC to 2 dimensions, there is an decrease in
thermal noise and an increase in the operating range of the MBL range in the
presence of disorder.

The fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE) is a milestone of modern day
physics, its disovery paved the way for the study of fractional charges which
do not obey abelian physics. However, all FQHE require an external magnetic
field in order for there to be fractionally charged electrons. This work shows
a theoretical study of strongly interaction electrons in the Kagome lattice
with magnetism. Under optimal conditions, a band gap opens on the surface of
the material which hosts fractional Fermions. These fractional Fermions form
composite quasi-electrons without the need for external magnetic field. These
states are predicted to host the FQHE without the need for an external magnetic
field.

<h3>Magnetic structure of the magnetoelectric material Ba$_2$MnGe$_2$O$_7$</h3>

<br>
A detailed investigation of Ba$_2$MnGe$_2$O$_7$ was performed in its
low-temperature magnetoelectric state combining neutron diffraction with
magnetization measurements on single crystals. In the paramagnetic state at 10
K, polarized neutron diffraction was applied to reveal the components of the
susceptibility tensor. The crystal and magnetic structures below the
antiferromagnetic transition temperature of $T_N \approx 4$ K were determined
using unpolarized neutron diffraction. This data implies no structural phase
transition from 10 K down to 2.5 K and is well described within the tetragonal
space group $P\bar{4}2_1m$. We found that in zero magnetic field the magnetic
space group is either $C_cmc2_1$ or $P_c2_12_12_1$ with antiferromagnetic order
along the [110] or [100] directions, respectively, while neighboring spins
along the [001] axis are ordered antiferromagnetically. A non-collinear spin
arrangement due to small canting within the $ab$ plane is allowed by symmetry
and observed experimentally. The ordered moment is found to be 3.24(3)
$\mu_B$/Mn$^{2+}$ at 2.5 K and the temperature-field dependent magnetic phase
diagram is mapped out by macroscopic magnetization. Distinct differences
between the magnetic structure of Ba$_2$MnGe$_2$O$_7$ as compared to those of
Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$ and Ca$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ are discussed.

We numerically study quantum avalanches in 1D disordered spin systems by
attaching two XXZ spin chains. One chain has low disorder representing a rare
Griffith's region, or thermal inclusion, and the second has larger disorder,
i.e. disorder larger than the observed finite-size crossover. Comparing
dynamics of this system to identical systems with uniformly large disorder, we
find evidence for exponentially slow thermalization (in disorder) within the
MBL regime when the rare region is present. We observe a decay of the spin
imbalance in the bulk of the large disorder region that persists to long times
($\sim10^{4}$) and find a universal behavior of the spectral function.

In this article a perturbative solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation
in the $D$-dimensional space $R^D$ with a general external potential is
studied. The solution describes the condensate wave-function of a gas
containing $N$ Bose particles. A criteria for the validity of the perturbative
solution is developed. Furthermore expressions for the particle density, the
chemical potential, the internal energy and the mean-square radius of the
condensate are derived corrected to first order in the coupling constant. The
scheme is then applied to obtain the solution of the GP equation in $D=1,2,3$
for external harmonic potentials. It is shown, in each case, that if $N$
exceeds a certain value the solution breaks down.

A high-efficiency spin-photon interface is an essential piece of quantum
hardware necessary for various quantum technologies. Self-assembled InGaAs
quantum dots have excellent optical properties, if embedded into an optical
micro-cavity they can show near-deterministic spin-photon entanglement and spin
readout, but an external magnetic field is required to address the individual
spin states, which usually is done using a superconducting magnet. Here, we
show a compact cryogenically compatible SmCo magnet design that delivers 475 mT
in-plane Voigt geometry magnetic field at 5 K, which is suitable to lift the
energy degeneracy of the electron spin states and trion transitions of a single
InGaAs quantum dot. This quantum dot is embedded in a birefringent high-finesse
optical micro-cavity which enables efficient collection of single photons
emitted by the quantum dot. We demonstrate spin-state manipulation by
addressing the trion transitions with a single and two laser fields. The
experimental data agrees well to our model which covers single- and two-laser
cross-polarized resonance fluorescence, Purcell enhancement in a birefringent
cavity, and variation of the laser powers.

Chiral crystals show promise for spintronic technologies on account of their
efficient spin filtering. This has led to significant recent interest in
quantitative characterization and first-principles prediction of their
optoelectronic properties, elucidating connections between chiroptical and spin
transport properties in chiral materials. Here, we outline a computational
framework for efficient ab initio calculations of circular dichroism (CD) in
crystalline materials. We leverage direct calculation of orbital angular
momentum and quadrupole matrix element calculations in density-functional
theory (DFT) and Wannier interpolation to calculate CD in complex materials,
removing the need for band convergence and accelerating Brillouin-zone
convergence compared to prior approaches. We find strong agreement with
measured CD signals in molecules and crystals ranging in complexity from small
bulk unit cells to 2D hybrid perovskites, and show the importance of the
quadrupole contribution to the anisotropic CD in crystals. We leverage the
tensorial behavior of CD with respect to propagation direction to analyze the
strongly orientation-dependent CD of compex chiral crystals such as hybrid
perovskites. Spin-orbit coupling affects the CD of crystals with heavier atoms,
as expected, but this is primarily due to changes in the electronic energies,
rather than due to direct contributions from the spin matrix elements.

<h3>Low temperature Terahertz Spectroscopy of LaFeO$_3$, PrFeO$_3$,  ErFeO$_3$, and LuFeO$_3$: magnon resonances and ground multiplet transitions</h3>

<br>
We report on zone center THz excitations of non-Jahn Teller LaFeO$_3$,
PrFeO$_3$, ErFeO$_3$, and LuFeO$_3$ distorted perovskites under external
magnetic fields up 7 T. Low temperature-low energy absorptions of LaFeO$_3$
show antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic magnons at $\omega$AFM ~31.4 and
$\omega$FM ~26.7 cm$^{-1}$ in the $\Gamma$4 (Gx, Ay, Fz) representation with
degeneracy near linearly lifted by the field. LuFeO$_3$ is characterized by
zero field magnetic resonances at $\omega$AFM ~26.3 cm$^{-1}$ and $\omega$FM
~22.4 cm$^{-1}$ in addition to Fe$^{3+}$ Zeeman-split crystal field (CF) 6A$_1$
ground transitions at ~10.4 cm$^{-1}$ triggered by subtle structural deviations
induced by the Lu 4f$^{14}$ smaller ionic radius. This local
quasi-non-centrosymmetric departure is also found in ErFeO$_3$ (Kramers
4f$^{11}$ Er$^{3+}$ (4I15/2); {\Gamma}2 (Fx, Cy, Gz) <TSR ~93 K), but with the
~4 cm$^{-1}$ Fe$^{3+}$ Zeeman branching strongly biased toward higher energies
due to 3d-4f exchange. Magnons at $\omega$AFM ~31.5 cm$^{-1}$ and $\omega$FM
~21.5 cm$^{-1}$ in ErFeO$_3$ do not undergo field induced band splits but a
13-fold increase in the antiferro ($\omega$AMF) /ferro($\omega$AFM) intensity
ratio. There is a remarkable field-dependent CF matching population balance
between Fe$^{3+}$ higher and Er$^{3+}$ lower Zeeman branches. Antiferro- and
ferro- resonances in PrFeO$_3$ turn much broader as non-Kramers Pr$^3$
introduces ligand changes at the A site leading into near degeneracy the
antiferromagnetic mode and the lowest Pr$^{3+}$ CF transition. We conclude that
low energy excitations in RFeO$_3$ (R=rare earth) strongly depend on the
lanthanide ionic size. Minute lattice displacements also underlie considering
non-centrosymmetric the most distorted RFeO$_3$ (R=rare earth). Changes
triggered by the smaller rare earth and the nonlinear intrinsic oxygen ion
polarizability provide grounds for interplay of ionic and electronic
interactions yielding ferroelectric spontaneous polarization.

Noncollinear magnetic structures and multiple magnetic phase transitions in a
sawtooth lattice antiferromagnet consisting of Cr$^{3+}$ are experimentally
identified in this work, thereby proposing the scenario of magnetism-driven
ferroelectricity in a sawtooth lattice. The title compound, BeCr$_2$O$_4$,
displays three magnetic phase transitions at low temperatures, at
$T_{N1}\approx$ 7.5 K, at $T_{N2}\approx$ 25 K and at $T_{N3}\approx$ 26 K,
revealed through magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and neutron diffraction
in this work. These magnetic phase transitions are found to be influenced by
externally applied magnetic fields. Isothermal magnetization curves at low
temperatures below the magnetic transitions indicate the antiferromagnetic
nature of \bco\ with two spin-flop-like transitions occurring at
$H_{c1}\approx$ 29 kOe and $H_{c2} \approx$ 47 kOe. Our high-resolution X-ray
and neutron diffraction studies, performed on single crystal and powder samples
unambiguously determined the crystal structure as orthorhombic $Pbnm$. By
performing the magnetic superspace group analysis of the neutron diffraction
data at low temperatures, the magnetic structure in the temperature range
$T_{N3,N2} < T < T_{N1}$ is determined to be the polar magnetic space group,
$P21nm.1^{\prime}(00g)0s0s$ with a cycloidal magnetic propagation vector
$\textbf{k}_1$ = (0, 0, 0.090(1)). The magnetic structure in the newly
identified phase below $T_{N1}$, is determined as $P21/b.1^{\prime}[b](00g)00s$
with the magnetic propagation vector $\textbf{k}_2$ = (0, 0, 0.908(1)). The
cycloidal spin structure determined in our work is usually associated with
electric polarization, thereby making \bco\ a promising multiferroic belonging
to the sparsely populated family of sawtooth lattice antiferromagnets.

<br>

Living cells are characterized by the micrometric confinement of various
macromolecules at high concentrations. Using droplets containing binary polymer
blends as artificial cells, we previously showed that cell-sized confinement
causes phase separation of the binary polymer solutions because of the
length-dependent wetting of the polymers. Here we demonstrate that the
wetting-induced heterogeneity of polymers also emerges in single-component
polymer solutions. The resulting heterogeneity leads to a slower transport of
small molecules at the center of cell-sized droplets than that in bulk
solutions. This heterogeneous distribution is observed when longer polymers
with lower wettability are localized at the droplet center. Molecular
simulations support this wetting-induced heterogeneous distribution by polymer
length. Our results suggest that cell-sized confinement functions as a
structural regulator for polydisperse polymer solutions that specifically
manipulate the diffusion of molecules, particularly those with sizes close to
the correlation length of the polymer chains.

<h3>Theory for charge density wave and orbital-flux state in  antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe</h3>

<br>
In this work, we theoretically study the charge order and orbital magnetic
properties of a new type of antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe. Based on first
principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have studied the
electronic structures, Fermi-surface quantum fluctuations, as well as phonon
properties of the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe. We find that charge
density wave emerges in such a system due to a subtle cooperation between
electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions and electron-phonon couplings, which
gives rise to an unusual scenario of interaction-triggered phonon
instabilities, and eventually yields a charge density wave (CDW) state. We
further show that, in the CDW phase, the ground-state current density
distribution exhibits an intriguing star-of-David pattern, leading to flux
density modulation. The orbital fluxes (or current loops) in this system
emerges as a result of the subtle interplay between magnetism, lattice
geometries, charge order, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be described
by a simple, yet universal, tight-binding theory including a Kane-Mele type SOC
term and a magnetic exchange interaction. We further study the origin of the
peculiar step-edge states in FeGe, which shed light on the topological
properties and correlation effects in this new type of kagome antiferromagnetic
material.

Coherence and tunneling play central roles in quantum phenomena. In a
tunneling event, the time that a particle spends inside the barrier has been
fiercely debated. This problem becomes more complex when tunneling repeatedly
occurs back and forth, and when involving many particles. Here we report the
measurement of the coherence time of various charge states tunneling in a
nanowire-based tunable Josephson junction; including single charges, multiple
charges, and Cooper pairs. We studied all the charge tunneling processes using
Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry, and observed
high-quality interference patterns. In particular, the coherence time of the
charge states was extracted from the interference fringes in Fourier space. In
addition, our measurements show the break-up of Cooper pairs, from a
macroscopic quantum coherent state to individual particle states. Besides the
fundamental research interest, our results also establish LZSM interferometry
as a powerful technique to explore the coherence time of charges in hybrid
devices.

EuTe4 is a newly-discovered van der Waals material exhibiting a novel
charge-density wave (CDW) with a large thermal hysteresis in the resistivity
and CDW gap. In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and
transport properties of EuTe4 using high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), magnetoresistance measurements, and
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We observe a CDW gap of about 200 meV at
low temperatures that persists up to 400 K, suggesting that the CDW transition
occurs at a much higher temperature. We observe a large thermal hysteretic
behavior of the ARPES intensity near the Fermi level, consistent with the
resistivity measurement. The hysteresis in the resistivity measurement does not
change under a magnetic field up to 7 T, excluding the thermal magnetic
hysteresis mechanism. Instead, the surface topography measured with STM shows
surface domains with different CDW trimerization directions, which may be
important for the thermal hysteretic behavior of EuTe4. Interestingly, we
observe a large negative magnetoresistance at low temperatures that can be
associated with the canting of magnetically ordered Eu spins. Our work shed
light on the understanding of magnetic, transport, and electronic properties of
EuTe4.

The analytic inference, e.g. predictive distribution being in closed form,
may be an appealing benefit for machine learning practitioners when they treat
wide neural networks as Gaussian process in Bayesian setting. The realistic
widths, however, are finite and cause weak deviation from the Gaussianity under
which partial marginalization of random variables in a model is
straightforward. On the basis of multivariate Edgeworth expansion, we propose a
non-Gaussian distribution in differential form to model a finite set of outputs
from a random neural network, and derive the corresponding marginal and
conditional properties. Thus, we are able to derive the non-Gaussian posterior
distribution in Bayesian regression task. In addition, in the bottlenecked deep
neural networks, a weight space representation of deep Gaussian process, the
non-Gaussianity is investigated through the marginal kernel.

Charge order has recently been revealed in infinite-layer nickelates as a

superconductivity remain elusive. Here, we report a resonant x-ray scattering
measurement of the charge order in infinite-layer PrNiO2. By measuring the
scattering intensity versus azimuthal angles, we resolve the intra-unit-cell
symmetry of the charge order and discover that it has predominant d-wave
orbital symmetry, strikingly resembling lightly doped cuprates. Our results
shed new light on the nature of charge order in infinite-layer nickelates and
may assist in establishing a common thread to understanding the role of charge
order in infinite-layer nickelates and cuprates.

Phase engineering by strains in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for
a variety of applications. Here, we present a study of strain induced
ferroelectric (FE) transition on bismuth oxyselenide (Bi$_2$O$_2$Se) films, a
high-performance (HP) semiconductor for next-generation electronics.
Bi$_2$O$_2$Se is non-FE at ambient. Upon a loading force $\gtrsim 400$ nN,
piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops on magnitude and
180$^\textrm{o}$ phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors,
these features are attributed to a transition to FE phase. The transition is
further proved by the appearance of a sharp peak on optical second harmonic
generation under an uniaxial strain. Fundamentally, solids with paraelectric at
ambient and FE under strains are scarce. FE transition is discussed with the
help of first-principle calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching
of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts
and serves as basis for a memristor with a huge switching ratio of 10$^6$. Our
work endows a new degree of freedom to a HP electronic/optoelectronic
semiconductor and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paving the way
for multiple exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computation

Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the algorithmic estimation of
stochastic entropy production (EP) from the trajectory data via machine
learning. A crucial element of such algorithms is the identification of a loss
function whose minimization guarantees the accurate EP estimation. In this
study, we show that there exists a host of loss functions, namely those
implementing a variational representation of the $\alpha$-divergence, which can
be used for the EP estimation. Among these loss functions, the one
corresponding to $\alpha = -0.5$ exhibits the most robust performance against
strong nonequilibrium driving or slow dynamics, which adversely affects the
existing method based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($\alpha = 0$). To
corroborate our findings, we present an exactly solvable simplification of the
EP estimation problem, whose loss function landscape and stochastic properties
demonstrate the optimality of $\alpha = -0.5$.

We report the discovery of structural phase transitions and superconductivity
in the full Heusler compounds $X$Pd$_2$Sn ($X$ = Ti, Zr, Hf), by means of
electrical transport, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and x-ray
diffraction measurements. TiPd$_2$Sn, ZrPd$_2$Sn and HfPd$_2$Sn undergo
structural phase transitions from the room-temperature cubic MnCu$_2$Al-type
structure (space group $Fm\bar{3}m$) to a low-temperature tetragonal structure
at around 160 K, 110 K and 90 K, respectively, which are likely related charge
density wave (CDW) instabilities. Low temperature single crystal x-ray
diffraction measurements of ZrPd$_2$Sn demonstrate the emergence of a
superstructure with multiple commensurate modulations below $T_s$. ZrPd$_2$Sn
and HfPd$_2$Sn have bulk superconductivity (SC) with transition temperatures
$T_c$ $\sim$ 1.2 K and 1.3 K, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations reveal evidence for structural and electronic instabilities which
can give rise to CDW formation, suggesting that these $X$Pd$_2$Sn systems are
good candidates for examining the interplay between CDW and SC.

The solid solution 122 compounds, Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2}$P$_{2}$, show
valence transition between divalent state and intermediate valence states at
Eu, which is firmly correlated to multiple degrees of freedom in the solid such
as the isostructural transition between the collapsed tetragonal (cT) and
uncollapsed tetragonal (ucT) structures, $3d$ magnetism, and the formation of
P-P dimers. To gain insights into the correlated behavior, we investigate the
effect of high magnetic fields on the samples of $x = 0.4$ and $0.5$ using
magnetostriction and magnetization measurements up to 60 T. The samples are in
the Eu valence fluctuating regime, where the possible structural transition
from cT to ucT may be induced by the Eu valence change under the magnetic
fields. For both samples, magnetostriction smoothly increases with increasing
magnetic fields. The behavior is in good agreement with the calculated results
using the interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model that describes the
valence change. This indicates that $\Delta L$ represents the change of the Eu
valence state in these compounds. Magnetization curves for both compounds show
good agreement with the ICF model at high magnetic fields. In contrast, in the
low magnetic field region, magnetization curves do not agree with the ICF
model. These results indicate that the Eu valence changes manifest themselves
in the magnetization curves at high magnetic fields and that the magnetism of
the $3d$ electrons manifests itself in the magnetization at low magnetic
fields. Hence, we conclude that the valence change occurs within the Eu valence
fluctuation regime coupled with the cT structure. Thereby, we believe that the
transition to ucT structure which is firmly coupled with the divalent Eu state
does not occur within the magnetic field range of the present study.

A review is given on the theory of the metal-insulator transitions (MITs) in
doped semiconductors. We focus in particular on the theory of their anomalous
magnetic properties, caused by the interplay of disorder and correlations, and
the possibility of finite temperature delocalization transitions caused by the
correlation induced temperature dependence of the spin scattering rate from
magnetic moments (MMs). This review article is devoted to the memory of
Konstantin B. Efetov.

Radio frequency reflectometry techniques enable high bandwidth readout of
semiconductor quantum dots. Careful impedance matching of the resonant circuit
is required to achieve high sensitivity, which however proves challenging at
cryogenic temperatures. Gallium arsenide-based voltage-tunable capacitors,
so-called varactor diodes, can be used for in-situ tuning of the circuit
impedance but deteriorate and fail at temperatures below 10 K and in magnetic
fields. Here, we investigate a varactor based on strontium titanate with
hyperabrupt capacitance-voltage characteristic, that is, a capacitance
tunability similar to the best gallium arsenide-based devices. The varactor
design introduced here is compact, scalable and easy to wirebond with an
accessible capacitance range from 45 pF to 3.2 pF. We tune a resonant
inductor-capacitor circuit to perfect impedance matching and observe robust,
temperature and field independent matching down to 11 mK and up to 2 T in-plane
field. Finally, we perform gate-dispersive charge sensing on a
germanium/silicon core/shell nanowire hole double quantum dot, paving the way
towards gate-based single-shot spin readout. Our results bring small, magnetic
field-resilient, highly tunable varactors to mK temperatures, expanding the
toolbox of cryo-radio frequency applications.

Increasing the number of electrons in electrostatically confined quantum dots
can enable faster qubit gates. Although this has been experimentally
demonstrated, a detailed quantitative understanding has been missing. Here we
study one- and three-electron quantum dots in silicon/silicon-germanium
heterostructures within the context of electrically-driven spin resonance
(EDSR) using full configuration interaction and tight binding approaches. Our
calculations show that anharmonicity of the confinement potential plays an
important role: while the EDSR Rabi frequency of electrons in a harmonic
potential is indifferent to the electron number, soft anharmonic confinements
lead to larger and hard anharmonic confinements lead to smaller Rabi
frequencies. We also confirm that double dots allow fast Rabi oscillations, and
further suggest that purposefully engineered confinements can also yield
similarly fast Rabi oscillations in a single dot. Finally, we discuss the role
of interface steps. These findings have important implications for the design
of multielectron Si/SiGe quantum dot qubits.

<h3>Quantum time reflection and refraction of ultracold atoms</h3>

Time reflection and refraction are temporal analogies of the spatial boundary
effects derived from Fermat's principle. They occur when classical waves strike
a time boundary where an abrupt change in the properties of the medium is
introduced. The main features of time-reflected and refracted waves are the
shift of frequency and conservation of momentum, which offer a new degree of
freedom for steering extreme waves and controlling phases of matter. The
concept was originally proposed for manipulating optical waves more than five
decades ago. However, due to the extreme challenges in the ultrafast
engineering of the optical materials, the experimental realization of the time
boundary effects remains elusive. Here, we introduce a time boundary into a
momentum lattice of ultracold atoms and simultaneously demonstrate the time
reflection and refraction experimentally. Through launching a
Gaussian-superposed state into the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) atomic chain, we
observe the time-reflected and refracted waves when the input state strikes a
time boundary. Furthermore, we detect a transition from time
reflection/refraction to localization with increasing strength of disorder and
show that the time boundary effects are robust against considerable disorder.
Our work opens a new avenue for future exploration of time boundaries and
spatiotemporal lattices, and their interplay with non-Hermiticity and many-body
interactions.

A two-dimensional (2D) Weyl semimetal featuring a spin-polarized linear band
dispersion and a nodal Fermi surface is a new topological phase of matter. It
is a solid-state realization of Weyl fermions in an intrinsic 2D system. The
nontrivial topology of 2D Weyl cones guarantees the existence of a new form of
topologically protected boundary states, Fermi string edge states. In this
work, we report the realization of a 2D Weyl semimetal in monolayer-thick
epitaxial bismuthene grown on SnS(Se) substrate. The intrinsic band gap of
bismuthene is eliminated by the space-inversion-symmetry-breaking substrate
perturbations, resulting in a gapless spin-polarized Weyl band dispersion. The
linear dispersion and spin polarization of the Weyl fermion states are observed
in our spin and angle-resolved photoemission measurements. In addition, the
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy reveals a pronounced local density
of states at the edge, suggesting the existence of Fermi string edge states.
These results open the door for the experimental exploration of the exotic
properties of Weyl fermion states in reduced dimensions.

<h3>Transfer learning on large datasets for the accurate prediction of  material properties</h3>

Graph neural networks trained on large crystal structure databases are
extremely effective in replacing ab initio calculations in the discovery and
characterization of materials. However, crystal structure datasets comprising
millions of materials exist only for the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
functional. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
to extend these models to other density functionals. We show that pre-training
significantly reduces the size of the dataset required to achieve chemical
accuracy and beyond. We also analyze in detail the relationship between the
transfer-learning performance and the size of the datasets used for the initial
training of the model and transfer learning. We confirm a linear dependence of
the error on the size of the datasets on a log-log scale, with a similar slope
for both training and the pre-training datasets. This shows that further
increasing the size of the pre-training dataset, i.e. performing additional
calculations with a low-cost functional, is also effective, through transfer
learning, in improving machine-learning predictions with the quality of a more
accurate, and possibly computationally more involved functional. Lastly, we
compare the efficacy of interproperty and intraproperty transfer learning.

<h3>Thermally activated nature of synchro-Shockley dislocations in Laves  phases</h3>

<br>
<br>
The synchro-Shockley dislocation, as a zonal dislocation, is the major
carrier of plastic deformation in Laves phases at high temperatures. The motion
of synchro-Shockley dislocations is composed of localized transition events
such as kink-pair nucleation, propagation and short-range atomic shuffling.
These events possess small activation volumes, presumably leading to sensitive
temperature and strain rate dependence on the Peierls stress. However, the
thermally activated nature of synchro-Shockley dislocations is not fully
understood so far. In this study, the transition mechanisms of the
rate-limiting steps of the motion of synchro-Shockley dislocations at different
shear strain levels are studied. The transition processes of dislocation motion
can be divided into shear-sensitive and -insensitive events. The external shear
strain lowers the energy barriers of shear-sensitive events. Thermal assistance
is indispensable in activating shear-insensitive events, implying that the
motion of synchro-Shockley dislocations is prohibited at low temperatures. We
aim to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of motion of zonal
dislocations in complex crystals.

<h3>High thermoelectric performance in metallic NiAu alloys</h3>

Thermoelectric (TE) materials seamlessly convert thermal into electrical
energy and vice versa, making them promising for applications such as power
generation or cooling. Although historically the TE effect was first discovered
in metals, state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on doped semiconductors
with large figure of merit, $zT$, that determines the conversion efficiency of
TE devices. While metallic alloys have superior functional properties, such as
high ductility and mechanical strength, they have mostly been discarded from
investigation in the past due to their small Seebeck effect. Here, we realize
unprecedented TE performance in metals by tuning the energy-dependent
electronic scattering. Based on our theoretical predictions, we identify binary
NiAu alloys as promising candidate materials and experimentally discover
colossal power factors up to 34 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ (on average 30
mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ from 300 to 1100 K), which is more than twice larger than in
any known bulk material above room temperature. This system reaches a $zT$ up
to 0.5, setting a new world record value for metals. NiAu alloys are not only
orders of magnitude more conductive than heavily doped semiconductors, but also
have large Seebeck coefficients originating from an inherently different
physical mechanism: within the Au s band conduction electrons are highly mobile
while holes are scattered into more localized Ni d states, yielding a strongly
energy-dependent carrier mobility. Our work challenges the common belief that
good metals are bad thermoelectrics and presents an auspicious paradigm for
achieving high TE performance in metallic alloys through engineering
electron-hole selective s-d scattering.

<br>
<br>
The structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of La2-xBaxCoMnO6 (0.25
=< x =< 1.0) compounds were investigated employing x-ray powder diffraction and
magnetometry. The crystal structure evolves from orthorhombic Pnma to
rhombohedral R-3c and then to hexagonal P63/mmc space group as the Ba
concentration increases. The magnetization as a function of temperature
measurements revealed a ferromagnetic-like behavior for all samples, but
antiferromagnetic interactions seem to also be present throughout the whole
series. The competition between magnetic phases leads to the phenomenon of
spontaneous exchange bias effect, observed in the zero field cooled
magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field curves. The evolution of
this effect along the series is discussed in terms of changes in the crystal
structure.

<h3>Phononic-magnetic dichotomy of the thermal Hall effect in the  Kitaev-Heisenberg candidate material Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</h3>

Majorana fermions as emergent excitations of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid
ground state constitute a promising concept in fault tolerant quantum
computation. Experimentally, the recently reported topological half-quantized
thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ seems to confirm
the Majorana nature of the material's magnetic excitations. It has been argued,
however, that the thermal Hall signal in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rather stems from
phonons or topological magnons than from Majorana fermions. Here we investigate
the thermal Hall effect of the closely related Kitaev quantum material
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, and we show that the thermal Hall signal emerges from at
least two components, phonons and magnetic excitations. This dichotomy results
from our discovery that the transversal heat conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ carries
clear signatures of the phononic $\kappa_{xx}$, but changes sign upon entering
the low-temperature, magnetically ordered phase. We systematically resolve the
two components by considering the detailed temperature and field dependence of
both $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\kappa_{xx}$. Our results demonstrate that uncovering a
genuinely quantized magnetic thermal Hall effect in a Kitaev topological
quantum spin liquid requires to disentangle phonon vs. magnetic contributions
where the latter include potentially fractionalized excitations such as the
expected Majorana fermions.

This paper complements a previous study of the isotropic and nematic phases
of the Gay-Berne liquid-crystal model [Mehri et al., Phys. Rev. E 105, 064703
(2022)] with a study of its smectic B phase found at high density and low
temperatures. We find also in this phase strong correlations between the virial
and potential-energy thermal fluctuations, reflecting hidden scale invariance
which implies the existence of isomorphs. The predicted approximate isomorph
invariance of the physics is confirmed by simulations of the standard and
orientational radial distribution functions, the mean-square displacement as a
function of time, as well as the force, torque, velocity, angular velocity, and
orientational time-autocorrelation functions. The regions of the Gay-Berne
model that are relevant for liquid-crystal experiments can thus fully be
simplified via the isomorph theory.

Achieving large-scale growth of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials
with high Curie temperature (TC) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is
highly desirable for the development of ultra-compact magnetic sensors and
magnetic memories. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) Cr2Te3 appears as a
promising candidate. Bulk Cr2Te3 exhibits strong PMA and a TC of 180 K.
Moreover, both PMA and TC might be adjusted in ultrathin films by engineering
composition, strain, or applying an electric field. In this work, we
demonstrate the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of vdW heterostructures of
five-monolayer quasi-freestanding Cr2Te3 on three classes of 2D materials:
graphene (semimetal), WSe2 (semiconductor) and Bi2Te3 (topological insulator).
By combining structural and chemical analysis down to the atomic level with ab
initio calculations, we confirm the single crystalline character of Cr2Te3
films on the 2D materials with sharp vdW interfaces. They all exhibit PMA and
TC close to the bulk Cr2Te3 value of 180 K. Ab initio calculations confirm this
PMA and show how its strength depends on strain. Finally, Hall measurements
reveal a strong anomalous Hall effect, which changes sign at a given
temperature. We theoretically explain this effect by a sign change of the Berry
phase close to the Fermi level. This transition temperature depends on the 2D
material in proximity, notably as a consequence of charge transfer. MBE-grown
Cr2Te3/2D material bilayers constitute model systems for the further
development of spintronic devices combining PMA, large spin-orbit coupling and
sharp vdW interface.

<br>
<br>
The kinetics of the assembly of semiflexible filaments through end-to-end
annealing is key to the structure of the cytoskeleton, but is not understood.
We analyze this problem through scaling theory and simulations, and uncover a
regime where filaments ends find each other through bending fluctuations
without the need for the whole filament to diffuse. This results in a very
substantial speed-up of assembly in physiological regimes, and could help
understand the dynamics of actin and intermediate filaments in biological
processes such as wound healing and cell division.

<h3>A Dirac-material-inspired non-linear electrodynamic model</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose and study the properties of a non-linear electrodynamics that
emerges inspired on the physics of Dirac materials. This new electrodynamic
model is an extension of the one-loop corrected non-linear effective Lagrangian
computed in the work of ref. [3]. In the particular regime of a strong magnetic
and a weak electric field, it reduces to the photonic non-linear model worked
out by the authors of ref. [3]. We pursue our investigation of the proposed
model by analyzing properties of the permittivity and permeability tensors, the
energy-momentum tensor and wave propagation effects in presence of a uniform
magnetic background. It is shown that the electrodynamics here presented
exhibits the vacuum birefringence phenomenon. Subsequently, we calculate the
lowest-order modifications to the interaction energy, considering still the
presence of a uniform external magnetic field. Our analysis is carried out
within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables
formalism. The calculation reveals a screened Coulomb-like potential with an
effective electric charge that runs with the external magnetic field but, as
expected for Dirac-type materials, the screening disappears whenever the
external magnetic field is switched off.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic annealing of the collinear antiferromagnet PdMn with excess Pd
produces strongly pinned magnetic moments in the annealing field direction.
This behaviour can be understood with the help of the magnetic-field-biased
diffusion model. Here, the magnetic field creates an energy difference between
the two possible occupations of the antiferromagnetic Mn-sublattices by the
Pd-excess atoms. This, mediated by diffusion, leads to an imbalance in the
amount of the Pd-excess atoms in these sublattices and, subsequently, to an
imbalance in the total magnetization of the sublattices. We investigate this
effect's dependence on the annealing field, time, and temperature. The results
are then compared to the results of the magnetic-field-biased diffusion model,
which gives good agreement.

<h3>Casimir-Lifshitz force for moving graphene</h3>

<br>
We consider the system of two parallel sheets of graphene which are moving
with relative parallel velocity $\vec{v}$ and calculate the Casimir energy by
using the scattering approach. The energy has real and imaginary parts. The
real part contains a velocity contribution to the force perpendicular to the
sheets. The imaginary part is related to a friction force parallel to the
graphene sheets. We prove that the friction appears if the relative velocity
becomes greater than the velocity of Fermi and if the modulo of reflection
coefficient is greater than the one which is significant for virtual photon
production. We analyze in detail the real contribution to the Casimir energy
for two systems -- graphene/graphene and ideal metal/graphene. In the
non-relativistic case $v \ll v_F$, the relative correction to the Casimir
energy $(\mathcal{E}_v - \mathcal{E}_0)/\mathcal{E}_0$ is proportional to the
$(v/c)^2$ (the maximum value is $0.0033$ for the gapeless case and $v=v_F$) for
the first system, and it is zero up to the Fermi velocity $v = v_F$ for system
ideal metal/graphene.

By means of high-temperature series expansions we study the singularities of
the specific heat ($c_v$) and the magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) of $S=1/2$
models presenting a phase transition belonging to the three dimensional
Heisenberg universality class. We first calculate the critical temperature
$T_c$ and the critical exponent $\gamma$ using the standard Dlog Pad\'e method
on $\overline{\chi}(\beta)=\chi(\beta)/\beta$ for the ferromagnetic Heisenberg
model on the face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, simple cubic, pyrochlore
and semi-simple cubic lattices ($\beta=1/T$). We also explore the possibility
of using this method on $\overline{\chi}(e)$ and $c_v(\beta)$ to calculate the
critical energy $e_c$ and the critical exponent $\alpha$. Finally, we adapt a
method initially developed for logarithmic singularities
[\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.165113}{Phys. Rev. B {\bf104},
165113 (2021)}] to cusp ($-1<\alpha<0$) and divergent singularities
($\gamma>0$), and propose different interpolation methods for $c_v$ and $\chi$.
We apply our method to several of the previously mentioned lattices and present
for each the reconstructed $c_v$ and $\chi$ down to $T_c$.

We report $^{139}$La nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on a
single-crystal sample of La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$ under uniaxial
stress. The spin order is shown to be more robust than at $x = 0.115$ doping,
however, for magnetic field $H$ in the $c$ direction and the stress applied
along the [110] direction ($\sigma_{[110]}$) the spin order transition
temperature $T_{\text{SO}}$ is rapidly suppressed. This is in stark contrast to
the behavior with stress in [100] direction ($\sigma_{[100]}$), which has
virtually no effect on $T_{\text{SO}}$. For $H \parallel [1\overline{1}0]$,
$\sigma_{[110]}$ stress has a weakened effect, and the rate $d T_\text{SO}/d
\sigma_\text{[110]}$ is drastically reduced. Thus, $H\parallel
[1\overline{1}0]$ acts as a stabilizing factor for spin-stripe order.
Also, the onset temperature of the low-temperature tetragonal crystal
structure $T_{\text{LTT}}$ is essentially unaffected by [110] stress, while it
decreases slowly under compression along [100].
We develop a Landau free energy model and interpret our findings as an
interplay of symmetry-breaking terms driven by the orientation of spins. These
findings put constraints on the applicability of theoretical models for the
development of spin-stripe order.

Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that their thermal stability
originates from the nontrivial topology in nature. Recently, a plethora of
topological spin textures have been theoretically predicted or experimentally
observed, enriching the diversity of the skyrmionic family. In this work, we
theoretically demonstrate the stabilities of various topological spin textures
against homochiral states in chiral magnets, including chiral bobbers, dipole
strings, and skyrmion tubes. They can be effectively classified by the
associated topological Hall signals. Multiple transition paths are found among
these textures, mediated by Bloch-point singularities, and the topological
protection property here can be manifested by a finite energy barrier with the
saddle point corresponding to the Bloch-point creation/destruction. By
carefully modulating the local property of a surface, such as interfacial DMI
induced by breaking the structural symmetry, the energy landscape of a magnetic
system can be tailored decisively. Significantly, the proposed scenario also
enables the manipulation of stabilities and transition barriers of these
textures, even accompanied by the discovery of ground-state chiral bobbers.
This study may raise great expectations on the coexistence of topological spin
textures as spintronics-based information carriers for future applications.

properties as they contain the smallest number of degrees of freedom and thus
have the cheapest computational cost. However, in complex materials, the FBZ
can take on irregular shapes where lattice symmetries are not apparent. Thus,
conventional cells (with more atoms and regular shapes) are often used to
describe materials, though dynamical and transport calculations are more
expensive. Here we discuss an efficient anharmonic lattice dynamic method that
maps conventional cell dynamics to primitive cell dynamics based on
translational symmetries. This leads to phase interference conditions that act
like conserved quantum numbers and a conservation rule for phonon scattering
that is hidden in conventional dynamics which significantly reduces
computational cost. We demonstrate this method for phonon transport in a
variety of materials with inputs from first-principles calculations and
attribute its efficiency to reduced scattering phase space and fewer summations
in scattering matrix element calculations.

Dynamical properties of materials determined using force constant expansions
in the HIPHIVE package and density functional theory as implemented in the Gpaw
code. Thermal conductivity of alkaline earth tellurides was determined, and the
narrower width between amplitudons and electrical modes exhibited supersonic
cooling and heat transportation, and our findings are in perfect agreement with
experimental research. When compared to the other binary crystals, BaTe appears
to offer the dual advantage of prolonged photon lifetime at normal temperature
as well as a speedier thermo-electric converter due to the tiny gap between
amplitudons and electric modes.

So far, quantum-limited power meters are not available in the microwave
domain, hindering measurement of photon number in itinerant quantum states. On
the one hand, single photon detectors accurately detect single photons, but
saturate as soon as two photons arrive simultaneously. On the other hand, more
linear watt meters, such as bolometers, are too noisy to accurately detect
single microwave photons. Linear amplifiers probe non-commuting observables of
a signal so that they must add noise and cannot be used to detect single
photons, either. Here we experimentally demonstrate a microwave
photon-multiplication scheme which combines the advantages of a single photon
detector and a power meter by multiplying the incoming photon number by an
integer factor. Our first experimental implementation achieves a n = 3-fold
multiplication with 0.69 efficiency in a 116 MHz bandwidth up to a input photon
rate of 400 MHz. It loses phase information but does not require any dead time
or time binning. We expect an optimised device cascading such multipliers to
achieve number-resolving measurement of itinerant photons with low dark count,
which would offer new possibilities in a wide range of quantum sensing and
quantum computing applications.

We report on the single-step fabrication of homogeneous and highly ordered
Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) over large areas on Au
nanolayers, that can be used for plasmonic sensing. A comprehensive study on
LIPSS formation on 32 nm Au film upon double, 170 fs pulse irradiation,
unveiled the key importance of interpulse delay as the determining factor
behind the homogeneity of laser induced structures and confirmed that highly
ordered, functional LIPSS occur solely upon double pulse irradiation. In
particular, the impact of pulse overlap, fluence and interpulse delay reveals
that homogeneous LIPSS formation is optimized within a specific interpulse
delay range. At the same time, examination of nanoscale features of the
structures points out a significant differentiation of the LIPSS formation
characteristics between single and double pulse irradiation. Theoretical
investigation complements experimental results providing insights on the
structure formation mechanism. Ellipsometric measurements validate that such
structures exhibit characteristic plasmon resonances that can be exploited for
sensing applications. The presented data demonstrate a novel functionality of
LIPSS, while providing strong evidence of the capabilities of femtosecond
double pulse irradiation as a valuable and low-cost tool for the precise
fabrication of highly ordered structures.

In many instances, the dynamical richness and complexity observed in natural
phenomena can be related to stochastic drives influencing their temporal
evolution. For example, random noise allied to spatial asymmetries may induce
stabilization of otherwise diverging trajectories in a nonlinear dynamics.
However, how exactly this type of phenomenology takes place in actual processes
is usually very difficulty to identify. Here we unveil few trends leading to
dynamical stabilization and diversity by introducing Gaussian noise to a class
of exactly solvable non-linear deterministic models displaying space-dependent
drifts. For the resulting nonlinear Langevin equations, the associated
Fokker-Planck equations can be solved through the similarity method or the
Fourier transform technique. By comparing the cases with and without noise, we
discuss the changes in the system's dynamical behavior. Simple cases of drift
and diffusion coefficients are explicitly analyzed and comparisons with some
other models in the literature are made. Our study illustrates the behavioral
richness originated from spatially heterogeneous dynamical systems under the
influence of white noise.

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnets hosting real-space topological spin textures are promising
platforms to model fundamental ultrafast phenomena and explore spintronics.
However, to date, they have only been fabricated epitaxially on specific
symmetry-matched crystalline substrates, to preserve their intrinsic
magneto-crystalline order. This curtails their integration with dissimilar
supports, markedly restricting the scope of fundamental and applied
investigations. Here, we circumvent this limitation by designing detachable
crystalline antiferromagnetic nanomembranes of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$, that
can be transferred onto other desirable supports after growth. We develop
transmission-based antiferromagnetic vector-mapping to show that these
nanomembranes harbour rich topological phenomenology at room temperature.
Moreover, we exploit their extreme flexibility to demonstrate three-dimensional
reconfiguration of antiferromagnetic properties, driven locally via
flexure-induced strains. This allows us to spatially design antiferromagnetic
states outside their typical thermal stability window. Integration of such
freestanding antiferromagnetic layers with flat or curved nanostructures could
enable spin texture designs tailored by magnetoelastic-/geometric-effects in
the quasi-static and dynamical regimes, opening new explorations into
curvilinear antiferromagnetism and unconventional computing.

<h3>Taming the entanglement in the dynamical theory of weakly interacting  Bose gases</h3>

<i>Michiel Wouters</i>
<br>
<br>
I show that the dynamics of the weakly interacting bose gas can be described
by a modified time dependent Bogoliubov theory. The novelty of the approach is
to include decoherence steps that gradually transform the entanglement entropy
of the pure state into the von Neumann entropy of a statistical mixture. This
approximation drastically reduces the entanglement that is needed in order to
represent the system's state while becoming exponentially accurate in the mean
field limit. I argue that this scheme can be extended to all quantum systems
whose ground state can be well approximated by a variational wave function. The
upshot is that the dynamics of almost all quantum systems can be reduced to
stochastic classical motion supplemented with small quantum fluctuations.

The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) describes the appearance of a transverse
voltage when a longitudinal voltage is applied in the presence of broken
time-reversal symmetry. The AHE plays a prominent role in the study of
topological quantum materials in which it results from the electronic Berry
curvature. More recently, it has been recognized that certain magnetic point
group symmetries can significantly enrich the anomalous Hall response by
higher-order terms, which are induced by Berry curvature multipoles. Here we
report the observation of the 3rd order AHE at room temperature in epitaxially
grown thin films of the kagome antiferromagnet FeSn. When a longitudinal a.c.
drive current at frequency \omega is applied, the 3rd order AHE appears as a
transverse voltage response at 3\omega from cryogenic conditions to above room
temperature in the presence of a magnetic field. Our scaling analysis of the
charge carrier scattering time reveals the almost purely topological origin of
3rd order anomalous Hall response at room temperature. Conducting a symmetry
analysis, model and ab-initio calculations, and magnetic Monte Carlo
simulations, we demonstrate this intrinsic contribution can be attributed to
the Berry curvature quadrupole moment, which arises in the spin-canted state of
FeSn. Our measurements establish the 3rd order nonlinear AHE as a sensitive
electrical transport probe to investigate antiferromagnetic phase transitions
in a variety of materials. Because Berry curvature multipole effects are
predicted to exist for 90 magnetic point groups, our work opens a new field to
study a variety of topological magnetic materials through their nonlinear
anomalous Hall response. Observing the 3rd order nonlinear AHE at room
temperature in an epitaxially grown material platform, we demonstrate a new
type of Hall effect with potential technological applications as frequency
multiplier elements.

We investigate the finite-size origin of the emission linewidth of a
spatially-extended, one-dimensional non-equilibrium condensate. We show that
the well-known Schawlow-Townes scaling of laser theory, possibly including the
Henry broadening factor, only holds for small system sizes, while in larger
systems the linewidth displays a novel scaling determined by
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang physics. This is shown to lead to an opposite dependence of
the linewidth on the optical nonlinearity in the two cases. We then study how
sub-universal properties of the phase dynamics such as the higher moments of
the phase-phase correlator are affected by the finite size and discuss the
relation between the field coherence and the exponential of the phase-phase
correlator. We finally identify a configuration with enhanced open boundary
conditions, which supports a spatially uniform steady-state and facilitates
experimental studies of the linewidth scaling.

Lead free, silicon compatible materials showing large electromechanical
responses comparable to, or better than conventional relaxor ferroelectrics,
are desirable for various nanoelectromechanical devices and applications.
Defect-engineered electrostriction has recently been gaining popularity to
obtain enhanced electromechanical responses at sub 100 Hz frequencies. Here, we
report record values of electrostrictive strain coefficients (M31) at
frequencies as large as 5 kHz (1.04 x 10-14 m2 per V2 at 1 kHz, and 3.87 x
10-15 m2 per V2 at 5 kHz) using A-site and oxygen-deficient barium titanate
thin-films, epitaxially integrated onto Si. The effect is robust and retained
even after cycling the devices >5000 times. Our perovskite films are
non-ferroelectric, exhibit a different symmetry compared to stoichiometric
BaTiO3 and are characterized by twin boundaries and nano polar-like regions. We
show that the dielectric relaxation arising from the defect-induced features
correlates very well with the observed giant electrostrictive response. These
films show large coefficient of thermal expansion (2.36 x 10-5/K), which along
with the giant M31 implies a considerable increase in the lattice anharmonicity
induced by the defects. Our work provides a crucial step forward towards
formulating guidelines to engineer large electromechanical responses even at
higher frequencies in lead-free thin films.

Ultrafast optical control of quantum systems is an emerging field of physics.
In particular, the possibility of light-driven superconductivity with
ultrashort laser pulses has attracted much of attention. To identify
non-equilibrium superconductivity, it is necessary to measure fingerprints of
superconductivity on ultrafast timescales. Recently non-linear THz third
harmonic generation (THG) was shown to directly probe the collective degrees of
freedoms of the superconducting condensate including particularly the Higgs
mode. Here we extend this idea to light-driven non-equilibrium states in
superconducting La2-xSrxCuO4 establishing a protocol to access the transient
superconducting (SC) order-parameter fluctuations. We perform an optical
pump-THz-THG drive experiment and use a two-dimensional spectroscopy approach
to disentangle the driven third-harmonic response of optically excited
quasiparticles and the pure condensate response. In this way, 2D spectroscopy
separately probes both the ultrafast pair breaking dynamics and transient
pairing amplitude of the condensate.

We argue that strain engineering is a powerful tool which may facilitate the
experimental realization and control of topological phases in laser-driven 2D
ferromagnetic systems. To this extent, we show that by applying a circularly
polarized laser field to a 2D honeycomb ferromagnet which is uniaxially
strained in either the zig-zag or armchair direction, it is possible to
generate a synthetic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) tunable by the
intensity of the applied electric field, as well as by the magnitude of applied
strain. Such deformations enable transitions to phases with opposite sign of
Chern number, or to trivial phases. These are basic results that could pave the
way for the development of a new field of Strain Engineered Topological
Spintronics (SETS).

We present a microscopic model, describing current-driven switching in
metallic atomic-size contacts. Applying a high current through an atomic-size
contact, creates a strong electronic nonequilibrium that excites vibrational
modes by virtue of the electron-vibration coupling. Using density functional
theory (DFT) in combination with the Landauer-B\"uttiker theory for
phase-coherent transport, expressed in terms of nonequilibrium Green's
functions (NEGFs), we study the current-induced forces arising from this
nonequilibrium and determine those vibrational modes which couple most strongly
to the electronic system. For single-atom lead (Pb) contacts we show specific
candidates for bistable switches, consisting of two similar atomic
configurations with differing electric conductance. We identify vibrational
modes that induce a transition between these configurations. Our results reveal
a possible origin of bistable switching in atomic-size contacts through
excitation of vibrations by inelastic electron scattering and underline the
power of the combined DFT-NEGF approach and statistical mechanics analysis of a
Langevin equation to overcome the time-scale gap between atomic motion and rare
switching events, allowing for an efficient exploration of the contacts'
configurational phase space.

The zero-bias anomaly in conductance spectra of single Co atoms on Cu(111)
observed at $\approx$ 4 K, which has been interpreted as being due to a Kondo
resonance, is strongly modified when the Co atoms are attached to monatomic Cu
chains. Scanning tunneling spectra measured at 340 mK in magnetic fields
exhibit all characteristics of spin-flip excitations. Their dependence on the
magnetic field reveals a magnetic anisotropy and suggests a non-collinear spin
state. This indicates that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which has so far been
neglected in theoretical studies of Co/Cu(111), has to be taken into account.
According to our density functional theory and multi-orbital quantum Monte
Carlo calculations SOC suppresses the Kondo effect for all studied geometries.

<br>
<br>
Oxides of $\textit{p}$-block metals ($\textit{e.g.}$, indium oxide) and
semimetals ($\textit{e.g.}$, antimony oxide) are of broad practical interest as
transparent conductors and light absorbers for solar photoconversion due to the
tunability of their electronic conductivity and optical absorption.
Comparatively, these oxides have found limited applications in
solar-to-hydrogen photocatalysis primarily due to their high electronegativity,
which impedes electron transfer for converting protons into molecular hydrogen.
We have shown recently that inserting $\textit{s}$-block metal cations into
$\textit{p}$-block oxides is effective at lowering electronegativities while
affording further control of band gaps. Here, we explain the origins of this
dual tunability by demonstrating the mediator role of $\textit{s}$-block metal
cations in modulating orbital hybridization while not contributing to frontier
electronic states. From this result, we carry out a comprehensive computational
study of 109 ternary oxides of $\textit{s}$- and $\textit{p}$-block metal
elements as candidate photocatalysts for solar hydrogen generation. We
downselect the most desirable materials using band gaps and band edges obtained
from Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory with Hubbard parameters
computed entirely from first principles, evaluate the stability of these oxides
in aqueous conditions, and characterize experimentally four of the remaining
materials, synthesized with high phase uniformity, to assess the accuracy of
computational predictions. We thus propose seven oxide semiconductors,
including CsIn$_3$O$_5$, Sr$_2$In$_2$O$_5$, and KSbO$_2$ which, to the extent
of our literature review, have not been previously considered as
water-splitting photocatalysts.

The response of Newtonian liquids to small perturbations is usually
considered to be fully described by homogeneous transport coefficients like
shear and dilatational viscosity. However, the presence of strong density
gradients at the liquid/vapor boundary of fluids hints at the possible
existence of an inhomogeneous viscosity. Here, we show that a surface viscosity
emerges from the collective dynamics of interfacial layers in molecular
simulations of simple liquids. We estimate the surface viscosity to be 8-16
times smaller than that of the bulk fluid at the thermodynamic point
considered. This result can have important implications for reactions at liquid
surfaces in atmospheric chemistry and catalysis.

The spin-orbit interaction in spin qubits enables spin-flip transitions,
resulting in Rabi oscillations when an external microwave field is resonant
with the qubit frequency. Here, we introduce an alternative driving mechanism
of hole spin qubits, where a far-detuned oscillating field couples to the qubit
phase. Phase driving at radio frequencies, orders of magnitude slower than the
microwave qubit frequency, induces highly non-trivial spin dynamics, violating
the Rabi resonance condition. By using a qubit integrated in a silicon fin
field-effect transistor (Si FinFET), we demonstrate a controllable suppression
of resonant Rabi oscillations, and their revivals at tunable sidebands. These
sidebands enable alternative qubit control schemes using global fields and
local far-detuned pulses, facilitating the design of dense large-scale qubit
architectures with local qubit addressability. Phase driving also decouples
Rabi oscillations from noise, an effect due to a gapped Floquet spectrum and
can enable Floquet engineering high-fidelity gates in future quantum
processors.

We propose a class of graphene-based moir\'e systems hosting flat bands on
kagome and honeycomb moir\'e superlattices. These systems are formed by
stacking a graphene layer on a 2D substrate with lattice constant approximately
$\sqrt{3}$ times that of graphene. When the moir\'e potentials are induced by a
2D irreducible corepresentation in the substrate, the model shows a rich phase
diagram of low energy bands including eigenvalue fragile phases as well as
kagome and honeycomb flat bands. Spin-orbit coupling in the substrate can lift
symmetry protected degeneracies and create spin Chern bands, and we observe
spin Chern numbers up to $3$. We additionally propose a moir\'e system formed
by stacking two graphene-like layers with similar lattice constants but
opposite signs of the Dirac Fermi velocity. This system exhibits multiple
kagome and honeycomb flat bands simultaneously. Both models we propose resemble
the hypermagic model of [Phys. Rev. B 106, 115418] and may provide ideal
platforms for the realization of strongly correlated topological phases.

It has been predicted that multichannel Kondo lattices undergo a symmetry
breaking at low temperatures. We use the dynamical large-$N$ technique to
ascertain this prediction in a microscopic model on a honeycomb lattice and
find out that it is not generally true. Rather, we find a 2+1D conformally
invariant fixed point, governed by critical exponents that are found
numerically. When we break time-reversal symmetry by adding a Haldane mass to
the conduction elections, three phases, separated by continuous transitions,
are discernible; one characterized by dynamic mass generation and spontaneous
breaking of the channel symmetry, one where topological defects restore channel
symmetry but preserve the gap, and one with a Kondo-coupled chiral spin-liquid.
We argue that the latter phase, is a fractional Chern insulator with anyonic
excitations.

In solid materials, nontrivial topological states, electron correlations, and
magnetism are central ingredients for realizing quantum properties, including
unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves, and quantum
spin liquids. The Kagome lattice, made up of connected triangles and hexagons,
can host these three ingredients simultaneously and has proven to be a fertile
platform for studying diverse quantum phenomena including those stemming from
the interplay of these ingredients. In this review, we introduce the
fundamental properties of the Kagome lattice as well as discuss the complex
observed phenomena seen in several emergent material systems such as the
intertwining of charge order and superconductivity in some Kagome metals,
modulation of magnetism and topology in some Kagome magnets, and symmetry
breaking with Mott physics in the breathing Kagome insulators. We also
highlight many open questions in the field as well as future research
directions of Kagome systems.
