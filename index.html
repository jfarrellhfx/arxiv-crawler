<h3>Effervescent waves in a binary mixture with non-reciprocal couplings</h3>

Non-reciprocal interactions between scalar fields that represent the
concentrations of two active species are known to break the parity and
time-reversal (PT) symmetries of the equilibrium state, as manifested in the
emergence of travelling waves. We explore the notion of nonlinear
non-reciprocity and consider a model in which the non-reciprocal interactions
can depend on the local values of the scalar fields. For generic cases where
such couplings exist, we observe the emergence of spatiotemporal chaos in the
steady-state. We associate this chaotic behaviour with a local restoration of
PT symmetry in fluctuating spatial domains, which leads to the coexistence of
oscillating densities and phase-separated droplets that are spontaneously
created and annihilated. We uncover that this phenomenon, which we denote as
effervescence, can exist as a dynamical steady-state in large parts of the
parameter space in two different incarnations, as characterized by the presence
or absence of an accompanying travelling wave.

Developing and maintaining life requires a lot of computation. This is done
by gene regulatory networks. But we have little understanding of how this
computation is organized. I show that there is a direct correspondence between
the structural and functional building blocks of regulatory networks, which I
call regulatory motifs. I derive a simple bound on the range of function that
these motifs can perform, in terms of the local network structure. I prove that
this range is a small fraction of all possible functions, which severely
constrains global network behavior. Part of this restriction is due to
redundancy in the function that regulatory motifs can achieve - there are many
ways to perform the same task. Regulatory motifs help us understanding how
genetic computation is organized and what it can achieve.

<h3>Membrane-based Optomechanical Accelerometry</h3>

Optomechanical accelerometers promise quantum-limited readout, high detection
bandwidth, self-calibration, and radiation pressure stabilization. We present a
simple, scalable platform that enables these benefits with nano-$g$ sensitivity
at acoustic frequencies, based on a pair of vertically integrated Si$_3$N$_4$
membranes with different stiffnesses, forming an optical cavity. As a
demonstration, we integrate an ultrahigh-Q ($>10^7$), millimeter-scale
Si$_3$N$_4$ trampoline membrane above an unpatterned membrane on the same Si
chip, forming a finesse $\mathcal{F}\approx2$ cavity. Using direct
photodetection in transmission, we resolve the relative displacement of the
membranes with a shot-noise-limited imprecision of 7 fm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$,
yielding a thermal-noise-limited acceleration sensitivity of 562
n$g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a 1 kHz bandwidth centered on the fundamental
trampoline resonance (40 kHz). To illustrate the advantage of radiation
pressure stabilization, we cold damp the trampoline to an effective temperature
of 4 mK and leverage the reduced energy variance to resolve an applied
stochastic acceleration of 50 n$g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in an integration time of
minutes. In the future, we envision a small-scale array of these devices
operating in a cryostat to search for fundamental weak forces such as dark
matter.

<h3>Effect of parallel magnetic field on Klein tunneling in $pn$ and $pnp$ graphene trilayer junctions</h3>

The effect of a parallel magnetic field $B$ and a potential substrate on the
transmission, conductivity, and Fano factor of a biased ABC-stacked $pn$ and
$pnp$ trilayer graphene junction (ABC-TLG) is investigated theoretically at low
energy. We discovered that, in the presence of a high magnetic field $B=1400$T,
the ABC-TLG can exhibit new Klein tunneling at two new incidence $k_y$ values,
in addition to the usual value of $k_y=0$ and whatever the energy value is.
Indeed, the transmission of ABC-TLG via $ pn $ and $ pnp $ junctions is
transformed into a three-separate transmission of single-like graphene (SLG),
with Klein tunneling appearing at $k_y=0$ and $k_y=\pm\kappa$ ($\kappa$ is
highly dependent on $B$). Furthermore, the conductivity $\sigma$ and Fano
factor $F$ behave similarly to SLG, with ABC-TLG having the lowest
$\sigma=3g_0/\pi$ and highest $F=1/3$ at $B=1400$T and
$\sigma_{\text{TLG}}=3\sigma_{\text{SLG}}$.

<h3>Single spin Landau-Zener-St√ºckelberg-Majorana interferometry of Zeeman-split states with strong spin-orbit interaction in a double quantum dot</h3>

Single spin state evolution induced by the
Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference in a Zeeman-spit four
level system in a periodically driven double quantum dot is studied
theoretically by the Floquet stroboscopic method. An interplay between
spin-conserving and spin-flip tunneling processes with the Electric Dipole Spin
Resonance (EDSR) that is induced in an individual dot and enhanced by the LZSM
multiple level crossings with the neighboring quantum dot is investigated as a
function of the microwave (MW) frequency, driving amplitude, interdot detuning,
and magnetic field. A number of special points in the parameter space are
identified, out of which where all the three features are merged. Under this
triple-crossing resonance condition the interdot tunneling is combined with a
fast spin evolution in each dot at the EDSR frequency. Harmonics of the EDSR
are revealed in the spin-dependent tunneling maps versus variable magnetic
field and MW frequency. The results are applicable for both electron and hole
systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and may be useful for developing new
time-efficient schemes of the spin control and readout in qubit devices.

<h3>Measuring non-Unitarity in non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14944v1" target = "_blank">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14944v1</a>

<br>
Non-orthogonality in non-Hermitian quantum systems generates tremendous
exotic quantum phenomena, which can be fundamentally traced back to
non-unitarity and is much more fundamental and universal than complex energy
spectrum. In this paper, we introduce an interesting quantity (denoted as
$\eta$) to directly and efficiently measure non-unitarity and the associated
non-Hermitian physics. By tuning model parameters of underlying non-Hermitian
systems, we find that the discontinuity of both $\eta$ and its first-order
derivative (denoted as $\partial \eta$) pronouncedly captures rich physics that
is fundamentally caused by non-unitarity. More concretely, in a 1D
non-Hermitian topological system, two mutually orthogonal edge states that are
respectively localized on two boundaries become non-orthogonal in the vicinity
of discontinuity of $\eta$ as a function of model parameter, which is dubbed
edge state transition. For the discontinuity of $\partial\eta$, by
investigating a two-level non-Hermitian model, we establish the connection
between the points of discontinuity of $\partial \eta$ and exceptional
points~(EPs). Furthermore, for models with more than two levels, we
analytically obtain the upper bound of the quantity $\eta$ with a novel
dependence on the configuration of EPs. By investigating this connection in
more general lattice models, we find that two concrete models at phase
transition points have discontinuity of $\partial\eta$, implying the existence
of EPs, while another model constructed by the regular Sturm-Liouville theory
exhibit continuous and differentiable $\eta$ but doesn't have an EP at the
phase transition point. For more concrete applications and a systematic
analytic theory about $\eta$, we leave them for future work.
