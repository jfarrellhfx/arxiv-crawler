<h3>Nonlinear Thermoelectric Probes of Anomalous Dynamics in Topological  Fermi Liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12520" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12520</a>

<i>Johannes Hofmann, Habib Rostami</i>
<p>In two-dimensional Fermi liquids, odd-parity Fermi surface deformations have
anomalously slow relaxation rates that are suppressed as $T^4$ with temperature
$T$, distinct from the standard Fermi-liquid $T^2$ scaling. We demonstrate here
that these long-lived modes, which are often hidden in linear response, have a
significant impact on nonlinear transport by establishing a direct
proportionality of nonlinear thermoelectric currents to the anomalously large
relaxation time. These currents exist in topological time-reversal invariant
Fermi liquids, and their magnitude is characterized by new topological heat
capacitance terms that we refer to as the {\em Berry curvature capacity} and
the {\em velocity-curvature capacity}. We quantify the effect in bismuth
telluride, which is an efficient thermoelectric and a topological insulator
with a hexagonal Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential to
explore topological and many-body effects in Fermi liquids through the
nonlinear thermoelectric response, urging further experimental studies.

<h3>Topology, magnetism and charge order in twisted MoTe2 at higher integer  hole fillings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12531</a>
<br>
<i>Taige Wang, Minxuan Wang, Woochang Kim, Steven G. Louie, Liang Fu, Michael P. Zaletel</i>
<p>Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) attracts an
expanding experimental interest recently for exhibiting a variety of
topological and magnetic states even at zero magnetic field. Most of the
studies right now focus on hole filling nu_h < 1, while a rich phase diagram at
higher hole filling calls for more investigation. We perform a thorough survey
of possible interaction-driven phases at higher integer hole fillings. We first
construct the continuum model from a first-principles calculation, and then
perform a self-consistent Hartree-Fock study of the interacting ground states.
We identify various valley polarized (VP) states at odd integer fillings and
intervalley coherent (IVC) states at even integer fillings and discuss the
energetics competition among them. We also discuss the origin and the
experimental implications of the curious Chern insulator at nu_h = 2.

<h3>A degenerate trion liquid in atomic double layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12571" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12571</a>
<br>
<i>Phuong X. Nguyen, Raghav Chaturvedi, Liguo Ma, Patrick Knuppel, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan</i>
<p>Trions are a three-particle bound state of electrons and holes. Experimental
realization of a trion liquid in the degenerate quantum limit would open a wide
range of phenomena in quantum many-body physics. However, trions have been
observed only as optically excited states in doped semiconductors to date. Here
we report the emergence of a degenerate trion liquid in a Bose-Fermi mixture of
holes and excitons in Coulomb-coupled MoSe2/WSe2 monolayers. By electrically
tuning the hole density in WSe2 to be two times the electron density in MoSe2,
we generate equilibrium interlayer trions with binding energy about 1 meV at
temperatures two orders of magnitude below the Fermi temperature. We further
demonstrate a density-tuned phase transition to an electron-hole plasma,
spin-singlet correlations for the constituent holes and Zeeman-field-induced
dissociation of trions. The results pave the way for exploration of the
correlated phases of composite particles in solids.

<h3>Magnetism of noncolinear amorphous DyCo3 and TbCo3 thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12602" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12602</a>
<br>
<i>Zexiang Hu, Ajay Jha, Katarzyna Siewierska, Ross Smith, Karsten Rode, Plamen Stamenov, J. M. D. Coey</i>
<p>The magnetization of amorphous DyCo3 and TbCo3 is studied by magnetometry,
anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optic Kerr effect to understand the
temperature-dependent magnetic structure. A square magnetic hysteresis loop
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and coercivity that reaches 3.5 T in the
vicinity of the compensation temperature is seen in thin films. An anhysteretic
soft component, seen in the magnetization of some films but not in their Hall
or Kerr loops is an artefact due to sputter-deposition on the sides of the
substrate. The temperature-dependence of the net rare earth moment from 4-300K
is deduced, using the cobalt moment in amorphous YxCo1-x. The single-ion
anisotropy of the quadrupole moments of the 4f atoms in the randomly-oriented
local electrostatic field gradient overcomes their exchange coupling to the
cobalt subnetwork, resulting in a sperimagnetic ground state where spins of the
noncollinear rare-earth subnetwork are modelled by a distribution of rare earth
moments within a cone whose axis is antiparallel to the ferromagnetic axis z of
the cobalt subnetwork. The reduced magnetization (Jz)/J at T=0 is calculated
from an atomic Hamiltonian as a function of the ratio of anisotropy to exchange
energy per rare-earth atom for a range of angles between the local anisotropy
axis and -z and then averaged over all directions in a hemisphere. The
experimental and calculated values of (J-z)/J are close to 0.7 at low
temperature for both Dy and Tb. On increasing temperature, the magnitude of the
rare earth moment and the local random anisotropy that creates the cone are
reduced; the cone closes and the structure approaches collinear ferrimagnetism
well above ambient temperature. An asymmetric spin flop of the exchange-coupled
subnetworks appears in the vicinity of the magnetization compensation
temperatures of 175K for amorphous Dy0.25Co0.75 and 200 K for amorphous TbCo3.

<h3>Graph Theorem for Chiral Exact Flat Bands at Charge Neutrality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12607" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12607</a>
<br>
<i>Gurjyot Sethi, Bowen Xia, Dongwook Kim, Hang Liu, Xiaoyin Li, Feng Liu</i>
<p>Chiral exact flat bands (FBs) at charge neutrality have attracted much recent
interest, presenting an intriguing condensed-matter system to realize exact
many-body phenomena, as specifically shown in "magic angle" twisted bilayer
graphene for superconductivity and triangulene-based superatomic graphene for
excitonic condensation. Yet, no generic physical model to realize such FBs has
been developed. Here we present a new mathematical theorem, called bipartite
double cover (BDC) theorem, and prove that the BDC of line-graph (LG) lattices
hosts at least two chiral exact FBs of opposite chirality, i.e., yin-yang FBs,
centered-around/at charge neutrality (E = 0) akin to the "chiral limit" of
twisted bilayer graphene. We illustrate this theorem by mapping it exactly onto
tight-binding lattice models of the BDC of LGs of hexagonal lattice for strong
topological and of triangular lattice for fragile topological FBs,
respectively. Moreover, we use orbital design principle to realize such exotic
yin-yang FBs in non-BDC lattices to instigate their real material discovery.
This work not only enables the search for exact chiral FBs at zero energy
beyond moir\'e heterostructures, but also opens the door to discovering quantum
semiconductor features with FB-enabled strongly correlated carriers.

<h3>Transport manifestations of fluctuation-induced effects in dissipative  impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12656" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12656</a>
<br>
<i>Marcel Gievers, Thomas Müller, Heinrich Fröml, Sebastian Diehl, Alessio Chiocchetta</i>
<p>We investigate the transport properties of a quantum wire of weakly
interacting fermions in the presence of a dissipative impurity. We calculate
current and conductance in this system due to applied external chemical
potential bias that can be measured in experimental realizations of ultracold
fermions in quasi one-dimensional traps. Using a Keldysh field theory approach
based on the Lindblad equation, we establish a perturbative scheme to study the
effect of imbalanced reservoirs. Logarithmically divergent terms are resummed
using a renormalization group method, and a novel power-law behavior for the
conductance as a function of the potential bias across the wire is found. In
contrast to the equilibrium case of a potential barrier in a Luttinger liquid,
the conductance exhibits a scaling behavior, which depends on the interaction
strength and on the loss probability. Repulsive interactions reduce the
conductance of the wire while attractive interactions enhance it. However,
perfect reflectivity and transparency are only reached in the absence of
dissipation.

<h3>Data-driven Design of High Pressure Hydride Superconductors using DFT  and Deep Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12694" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12694</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Wines, Kamal Choudhary</i>
<p>The search for new conventional superconductors with a high transition
temperature ($T_c$) is an extremely active area of research in the field of
condensed matter physics. Specifically, the observation of superconductivity in
hydride-based materials under ultrahigh pressures (i.e., H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$)
has fueled the interest in a more data-driven approach to discovering new
high-pressure hydride superconductors. In this work, we utilized density
functional theory calculations (DFT) and the Joint Automated Repository for
Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) database to predict the $T_c$ of over
950 hydride materials under a pressure range of (0 to 500) GPa. Importantly, we
analyze the chemistry, phonon density of states and Eliashberg functions of the
materials to analyze features that help explain variations in our datasets.
Finally, to accelerate materials screening and determine a more complete map of
hydrides under pressure, we trained an atomistic line graph neural network
(ALIGNN) model to predict $T_c$ at significantly reduced cost. Moreover, we
used a universal machine learned force-field (ALIGNN-FF) to relax the
structures under pressure, significantly reducing the number of DFT required
calculations for materials screening.

<h3>Excitations and phase ordering of the spin-stripe phase of a binary  dipolar condensate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12695" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12695</a>
<br>
<i>Au-Chen Lee, D. Baillie, P. B. Blakie</i>
<p>We consider the ground states, excitations and dynamics of a
quasi-two-dimensional binary dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. Our focus is on
the transition to a spin-stripe ground state in which the translational
invariance is spontaneously broken by a striped immiscible pattern of the
alternating components. We develop a ground state phase diagram showing the
parameter regime where the spin-stripe state occurs. Using Bogoliubov theory we
calculate the excitation spectrum and structure factors. We identify a balanced
regime where the system has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and in the spin-stripe
state this yields a nonsymmorphic symmetry. We consider the evolution of the
system following a quench from the uniform to spin-stripe state, revealing
novel ordering dynamics involving defects of the stripe order. Using an order
parameter to characterize the orientational order of the stripes, we show that
the phase ordering exhibits dynamic scaling.

<h3>Dynamical Approach to Realize Room-Temperature Superconductivity in  LaH$_{10}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12706</a>
<br>
<i>Chendi Xie, Adam D. Smith, Haoran Yan, Wei-Chih Chen, Yao Wang</i>
<p>Metallic hydrogen and hydride materials stand as promising avenues to achieve
room-temperature superconductivity. Characterized by their high phonon
frequencies and moderate coupling strengths, several high-pressure hydrides
were theoretically predicted to exhibit transition temperatures ($T_c$)
exceeding 250\,K, a claim further substantiated by experimental evidence. In an
effort to push $T_c$ beyond room temperature, we introduce a dynamical method
that involves stimulating hydrides with mid-infrared lasers. Employing Floquet
first-principles simulations, we observe that in a nonequilibrium state induced
by light, both the electronic density of states and the coupling to high-energy
phonons see notable enhancements. These simultaneous improvements collectively
result in an estimated 20\%-30\% rise in $T_c$ in practical pump conditions.
Our theoretical investigation, therefore, offers a novel strategy to
potentially raise the $T_c$ of hydrides above room temperature.

<h3>Polarized Neutron Diffraction Study on UPt$_{2}$Si$_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12718</a>
<br>
<i>Fusako Kon, Chihiro Tabata, Hiraku Saito, Taro Nakajima, Hiroyuki Hidaka, Tatsuya Yanagisawa Hiroshi Amitsuka</i>
<p>We investigated the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered
state ($T_{\rm N} \sim$ 34 K) in tetragonal UPt$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ using polarized
and unpolarized neutron diffraction. Previous neutron scattering studies
reported that this system possesses a simple AFM structure with a propagation
vector, $Q = 0$, and the ordered magnetic moments aligned along the $c$-axis.
By contrast, our latest resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) experiments have
revealed that the magnetic structure is modulated by the charge-density-wave
(CDW) order, which emerges in one of the two Pt atomic layers in the unit cell
below $\sim$ 320 K. The modulation is characterized by a transverse wave in the
$c$-plane, with the propagation vector of the CDW order, $q_{\rm CDW } =$
($\sim$0.42, 0, 0). In the present study using neutron scattering, we observed
that the superlattice reflections specified by $q_{\rm CDW }$ develop below
$T_{\rm N}$, in addition to the magnetic reflections with $Q = 0$, thereby
further confirming the presence of modulation in the AFM structure of this
system. From detailed analyses, we revealed that the amplitude of the
transverse-wave magnetic modulation to be 0.72(2) $\mu_{\rm B}$/U, which is a
piece of quantitative information that could not be obtained through the RXS
experiments. This implies that the CDW drives the ordered magnetic moments to
be tilted up to 20$^\circ$ in the AFM state. The observations strongly suggest
that the magnetism of UPt$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ is heavily influenced by the
hybridization effects between 5f electrons of U and 5d electrons of Pt.

<h3>Nematic charge-density-wave correlations in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12749" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12749</a>
<br>
<i>Ruixian Liu, Wenliang Zhang, Yuan Wei, Zhen Tao, Teguh C. Asmara, Vladimir N. Strocov, Thorsten Schmitt, Xingye Lu</i>
<p>The occurrence of charge-density-wave (CDW) order is a common thread in the
phase diagram of cuprate high-transition-temperature ($T_c$) superconductors.
In iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), nematic order and fluctuations play a
decisive role in driving other emergent orders. CDW order has been observed by
scanning tunneling microscopy for various FeSCs such as FeSe thin films,
uniaxially strained LiFeAs, and tetragonal FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$. However, it
remains elusive if the CDW in these materials is a bulk phenomenon as well as
if and how it intertwines with the electronic nematicity. Using energy-resolved
resonant X-ray scattering at the Fe-L$_3$ edge, we report the discovery of a
local-strain-induced incommensurate isotropic CDW order in
FeSe$_{0.82}$S$_{0.18}$. A highly anisotropic CDW response under uniaxial
strain unambiguously manifests that the CDW is directly coupled to the
nematicity. Transforming part of Fe$^{2+}$ to Fe$^{3+}$ on the surface of
{\FSS} reveals that the same isotropic CDW can be induced, enhanced, and
stabilized in the whole nematic regime measured ($x=0-0.19$). As Fe$^{3+}$ can
create local lattice distortions on the surface, the CDW could arise from the
interaction between the local strain around Fe$^{3+}$ and the nematic electron
correlations. Our experimental observation of a local-strain-induced CDW gives
vital information for understanding the interplay between electron correlations
and the electronic nematicity in FeSCs.

<h3>Flux coupled tunable superconducting resonator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12755</a>
<br>
<i>Juliang Li, Pete Barry, Tom Cecil, Marharyta Lisovenko, Volodymyr Yefremenko, Gensheng Wang, Serhii Kruhlov, Goran Karapetrov, Clarence Chang</i>
<p>We present a design and implementation of frequency-tunable superconducting
resonator. The resonance frequency tunability is achieved by flux-coupling a
superconducting LC-loop to a current-biased feedline; the resulting screening
current leads to a change of the kinetic inductance and shift in the resonance
frequency. The thin film aluminum resonator consists of an interdigitated
capacitor and thin line inductors forming a closed superconducting loop. The
magnetic flux from the nearby current feedline induces Meissner shielding
currents in the resonator loop leading to change in the kinetic part of the
total inductance of the resonator. We demonstarte continuous frequency tuning
within 160 MHz around the resonant frequency of 2.7 GHz. We show that: (1)
frequency upconversion is achieved when kHz AC modulation signal is
superimposed onto the DC bias resulting in sidebands to the resonator tone; (2)
three-wave mixing is attained by parametrically pumping the nonlinear kinetic
inductance using a strong RF pump signal in the feedline. The simple
architecture is amenable to large array multiplexing and on-chip integration
with other circuit components. The concept could be applied in flux
magnetometers, upconverters, and parametric amplifiers operating above 4 Kelvin
cryogenic temperatures when alternative high critical temperature material with
high kinetic inductance is used.

<h3>Operando real-space imaging of a structural phase transformation in a  high-voltage electrode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12765" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12765</a>
<br>
<i>Yifei Sun, Sunny Hy, Nelson Hua, James Wingert, Ross Harder, Ying Shirley Meng, Oleg Shpyrko, Andrej Singer</i>
<p>Discontinuous solid-solid phase transformations play a pivotal role in
determining properties of rechargeable battery electrodes. By leveraging
operando Bragg Coherent Diffractive Imaging (BCDI), we investigate the
discontinuous phase transformation in LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4 within a fully
operational battery. Throughout Li-intercalation, we directly observe the
nucleation and growth of the Li-rich phase within the initially charged Li-poor
phase in a 500 nm particle. Supported by the microelasticity model, the
operando imaging unveils an evolution from a curved coherent to planar
semi-coherent interface driven by dislocation dynamics. We hypothesize these
dislocations exhibit a glissile motion that facilitates interface migration
without diffusion of host ions, leaving the particle defect-free
post-transformation. Our data indicates negligible kinetic limitations
impacting the transformation kinetics, even at discharge rates as fast as C/2.
This study underscores BCDI's capability to provide operando insights into
nanoscale phase transformations, offering valuable guidance for electrochemical
materials design and optimization.

<h3>Information thermodynamics of transition paths between multiple  mesostates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12767</a>
<br>
<i>Miranda D. Louwerse, David A. Sivak</i>
<p>A central concern across the natural sciences is a quantitative understanding
of the mechanism governing rare transitions between two metastable states.
Recent research has uncovered a fundamental equality between the time-reversal
asymmetry of the ensemble of such transition paths and the informativeness of
system dynamics about the reactivity of a given trajectory, immediately leading
to quantitative criteria for judging the importance of distinct system
coordinates for the transition. Here we generalize this framework to multiple
mesostates. We find that the main system-wide and coordinate-specific results
generalize intuitively, while the combinatorial diversity of pairwise
transitions raises new questions and points to new concepts. This work
increases the previous framework's generality and applicability and forges
connections to enhanced-sampling and coarse-grained dynamical approaches such
as milestoning and Markov-state models.

<h3>Quantum Criticality in YbCu4Ni</h3>

<p>We report on the quantum criticality of YbCu$_4$Ni as revealed by our
combined micro- and macro-measurements. We determine the crystal structure of
YbCu$_4$Ni with site mixing by neutron diffraction measurements, which suggests
the possible presence of Kondo disorder. However, decreasing the local spin
susceptibility distribution and the development of spin fluctuations below 10 K
at ambient pressure by muon spin rotation and relaxation measurements suggests
that YbCu4Ni exhibits quantum criticality. Therefore, our experimental results
indicate that YbCu4Ni is a new material that exhibits quantum criticality under
a zero magnetic field and ambient pressure.

<h3>Twisted topology and Bipolar Non-Hermitian Skin Effect induced by  long-range asymmetric coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12780" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12780</a>
<br>
<i>S. M. Rafi-Ul-Islam, Zhuo Bin Siu, Haydar Sahin, Md. Saddam Hossain Razo, Mansoor B. A. Jalil</i>
<p>We investigate the twisted topology of the complex eigenspectrum of a
one-dimensional non-Hermitian system under the influence of long-range
unidirectional coupling. Unlike the complex energy spectrum of the conventional
Hatano-Nelson chain, which takes the form of a single loop with a topological
winding index of a definite sign, the introduction of long-range unidirectional
hopping results in the creation of multiple twisted loops. These twisted loops
exhibit opposite signs of the topological winding index, which correlate to
alternating clockwise and anticlockwise energy windings. The simultaneous
presence of both signs of the winding index translates into a bipolar
non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which challenges the conventional wisdom that
the NHSE localization is dependent on the direction of the dominant
nearest-neighbor interactions. In this bipolar NHSE, the exponents of the
complex energy eigenvectors corresponding to clockwise and anti-clockwise
windings, lie inside and outside of the complex unit circle, respectively.
Interestingly, at the intersections of oppositely oriented energy loops where
the sign of the topological winding index flips, the energy becomes
real-valued, leading to a suppression of the NHSE. This marks the emergence of
Bloch-like contact points, where both the bipolar NHSE and the traditional NHSE
vanish. Based on the non-Hermitian model we provide analytical insights into
the effects of long-range unidirectional coupling to the winding topology of
its complex energy spectra and their broader implications for the field of
condensed matter physics.

<h3>Strain-driven Charge Localisation and Spin Dynamics of Paramagnetic  Defects in S-deficit 2H-MoS2 Nanocrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12805" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12805</a>
<br>
<i>Sudipta Khamrui, Kamini Bharti, Daniella Goldfarb, Tilak Das, Debamalya Banerjee</i>
<p>A microscopic control over the origin and dynamics of localised spin centres
in lower dimensional solids turns out to be a key factor for next generation
spintronics and quantum technologies. With the help of low temperature electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, supported by the first-principles
calculations within density functional theory (DFT) formulation, we found the
origin of different high-spin paramagnetic intrinsic charge-centres, Mo3+(4d3)
and Mo2+(4d4) present in the nano-crystalline sulfur deficit hexagonal
molybdenum disulfide (2H-MoS_(2-x)), against the established notion of spin-1/2
, Mo5+ centres. A critical strain generated in the nano-structured 2H-MoS_(2-x)
was found to be very crucial for spin-localization in this layered material.
Indeed, computationally effective proposition of the PBE+U
exchange-correlations within DFT including D3-dispersion corrections found to
be more viable than expensive higher rung of exchange-correlation functionals,
explored earlier. It is also found that the oxygen vacancy of the reduced oxide
phase, embedded in 2H-MoS_(2-x) host lattice, has the longest relaxation times.
Moreover, the temperature dependence of spin-lattice relaxation measurements
reveals a direct process for interstitial spin centres and a Raman process for
both sulfur and oxygen vacancy sites. We expect such observation would be a
valuable pillar for better understanding of the next generation quantum
technologies and device applications.

<h3>Thermodynamic properties of disordered quantum spin ladders</h3>

<br>
<i>Erol Vatansever, Georgi G. Grahovski, Nikolaos G. Fytas</i>
<p>In this paper, we study the thermodynamic properties of spin-$1/2$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ladders by means of the stochastic series
expansion quantum Monte Carlo technique. This includes the thermal properties
of the specific heat, uniform and staggered susceptibilities, spin gap, and
structure factor. Our numerical simulations are probed over a large ensemble of
random realizations in a wide range of disorder strengths $r$, from the clean
($r=0$) case up to the diluted ($r \rightarrow 1$) limit, and for selected
choices of number of legs $L_y$ per site. Our results show some interesting
phenomena, like the presence of crossing points in the temperature plane for
both the specific heat and uniform susceptibility curves which appear to be
universal in $r$, as well as a variable dependence of the spin gap in the
amount of disorder upon increasing $L_y$.

<h3>Nonreciprocal Ballistic Transport in Asymmetric Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12837" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12837</a>
<br>
<i>Minhao Zou, Hao Geng, Rong Ma, Wei Chen, Li Sheng, Dingyu Xing</i>
<p>Nonreciprocal transport in uniform systems has attracted great research
interest recently and the existing theories mainly focus on the diffusive
regime. In this study, we uncover a novel scenario for nonreciprocal charge
transport in the ballistic regime enabled by asymmetric band structures of the
system. The asymmetry of the bands induces unequal Coulomb potentials within
the system as the bias voltage imposed by the electrodes inverts its sign. As a
result, the bands undergo different energy shifts as the current flows in
opposite directions, giving rise to the nonreciprocity. Utilizing the
gauge-invariant nonlinear transport theory, we show that the nonreciprocal
transport predominantly originates from the second-order conductance, which
violates the Onsager reciprocal relation but fulfills a generalized reciprocal
relation similar to that of unidirectional magnetoresistance. The ballistic
nonreciprocal transport phenomena differ from the diffusive ones by considering
the internal asymmetric Coulomb potential, a factor not accounted for in
diffusive cases but undeniably crucial in ballistic scenarios. Our work opens a
avenue for implementing nonreciprocal transport in the ballistic regime and
provides an alternative perspective for further experimental explorations for
nonreciprocal transport.

<h3>Li-decorated BC3 nanopores: Promising materials for hydrogen storage</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12841</a>
<br>
<i>I. Cabria, A. Lebon, M. B. Torres, L. J. Gallego, A. Vega</i>
<p>In the quest of new absorbent for hydrogen storage, we investigate the
capacities of slit pores formed by two BC3 sheets decorated with Li atoms.
Their hydrogen storage capacities are determined using density-functional
theory in conjunction with a quantum-thermodynamic model that allows to
simulate real operating conditions, i.e., finite temperatures and different
loading and depletion pressures applied to the adsorbent in the charge-delivery
cycles. We show that the capacities of the adsorbed hydrogen phase of
Li-decorated BC3 slit pores are larger than those reported recently for
graphene and Li-decorated borophene slit pores. On the other hand, the usable
volumetric and gravimetric capacities of Li-decorated BC3 slit pores can meet
the targets stipulated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for onboard
hydrogen storage at moderate temperatures and loading pressures well below
those used in the tanks employed in current technology. In particular, the
usable volumetric capacity for pore widths of about 10 {\AA} meets the DOE
target at a loading pressure of 6.6 MPa when depleting at ambient pressure. Our
results highlight the important role played by the rotational degree of freedom
of the H2 molecule in determining the confining potential within the slip pores
and their hydrogen storage capacities.

<h3>Emergent Atomic Environments in Twisted Bilayer Graphene and Their Use  in the Prediction of the Vibrational Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12864" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12864</a>

<p>While Bernal stacked bilayer graphene bears two distinct atom types in its
lattice, there exists no analytical framework addressing the number of atomic
environments that emerge in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices. In this
work, we have computationally analyzed 120 different twisted bilayer
superlattices using descriptor functions to study the emergent local
environments. Our study reveals that the number of atoms with unique local
environments depend on the superlattice size linearly. Moreover, this linear
dependence manifests itself on two distinct lines and this automatically
suggests a new classification scheme based on the local environments. As a
possible application, the use of local environments in the investigation of
vibrational properties is discussed with respect to the existing literature.
Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to calculate the phonon density of
states of the 120 structures as well as the local phonon density of states of
their individual atoms. The similarity of the contributions of local density of
states coming from atoms with the same local environment is demonstrated. Local
density of states of the atoms with unique local environments of an arbitrary
selection of the structures is then used to train a machine learning model.
This model is used to predict the phonon spectra of twisted bilayer structures.
Performance of the trained model is discussed thoroughly via different
selection of training and test sets, and it is shown that the model proves
effective in predicting the vibrational properties of any given twisted bilayer
structure. The possible applications of the generic method presented which
reaches far beyond twisted bilayer graphene is also discussed.

<h3>Light-activated Janus microswimmers in a thermotropic liquid crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12866</a>

<p>The self-propulsion of Janus particles in a nematic liquid crystal under an
LED source with a 542 nm wavelength is reported. The particles used here are 10
micrometer silica-made half-coated with titanium. They are suspended at low
concentrations in nematic 4-Cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB). We observe that the
Janus particles move in the direction of their Ti-coated side and perpendicular
to the nematic director. Based on this observation, we propose that the larger
absorption of light at the metal-coated side of a particle creates a local
temperature gradient that drives the motion. The trajectories of the Janus
particles in the nematic liquid crystal were tracked at different intensities
of the applied light. A model is developed to describe the mean-squared
displacement of a Janus particle suspended in a nematic liquid crystal. The
model assumes that the Janus particle feels the liquid crystal as a continuum
with the anisotropic viscosity of the bulk nematic phase. Moreover the
viscoelasticity of the liquid crystal is also taken into account. The swimming
force is assumed to be proportional to the local temperature gradient along the
particle. The model describes well the experimental data and the fitting
parameter related to the magnitude of the swimming force increases by
increasing the intensity of the applied light. Previous reports exist of
self-thermophoresis of Janus particles in isotropic, purely viscous fluids.
Still, we believe this to be the first report of a self-thermophoretic Janus
particle swimming in a nematic liquid crystal.

<h3>Dynamic Screening by Plasticity in Amorphous Solids</h3>

<i>H. George E. Hentschel, Anna Pomyalov, Itamar Procaccia, Oran Szachter</i>
<p>In recent work, it was shown that elasticity theory can break down in
amorphous solids subjected to nonuniform {\em static} loads. The elastic fields
are screened by geometric dipoles; these stem from gradients of the quadrupole
field associated with plastic responses. Here we study the dynamical responses
induced by {\em oscillatory} loads. The required modification to classical
elasticity is described. Exact solutions for the displacement field in circular
geometry are presented, demonstrating that dipole screening results in
essential departures from the expected predictions of classical elasticity
theory. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical
predictions and to delineate their range of validity.

<h3>From quantum to classical via crystallization</h3>

<br>
<i>Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis</i>
<p>We show that classical states can emerge as pure ground state solutions of a
quantum many-body system. We use a simple Hubbard model in 1D with strong
short-range interactions and a second nearest neighbor hopping with N particles
arranged among M sites. We show that the ground state of this Hubbard chain for
M=2N-1 consists of a single many-body state where the strongly interacting
particles arrange in a classical state with crystalline order. The ground state
is separated by an energy gap from the first excited state, and survives in the
thermodynamic limit for large N. The energy gap increases linearly with the
strength of the interaction between the particles making the classical ground
state robust to external perturbations like disorder. Our result is an example
of how a quantum system can converge to a classical state, like a crystal,
without requiring decoherence, wavefunction collapse or other external
mechanisms.

<p>Topological quantum phases have been largely understood in weakly correlated
systems, which have identified various quantum phenomena such as spin Hall
effect, protected transport of helical fermions, and topological
superconductivity. Robust ferromagnetic order in correlated topological
materials particularly attracts attention, as it can provide a versatile
platform for novel quantum devices. Here, we report singular Hall response
arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in
combination with electron correlation in an itinerant, van der Waals
ferromagnetic semimetal, Fe3GaTe2, with a high Curie temperature of Tc=360 K.
High anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling,
resistivity upturn at low temperature, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient are
observed in Fe3GaTe2, which implies heavy fermion features in this
ferromagnetic topological material. Our circular dichroism in angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations support the original
electronic features in the material. Thus, low-dimensional Fe3GaTe2 with
electronic correlation, topology, and room-temperature ferromagnetic order
appears to be a promising candidate for robust quantum devices.

<p>Charge noise has been one of the main issues in realizing high fidelity
two-qubit quantum gates in semiconductor based qubits. Here, we study the
influence of quasistatic noise in quantum dot detuning on the controlled phase
gate for spin qubits that defined on a double quantum dot. Analytical
expressions for the noise averaged Hamiltonian, exchange interaction, as well
as the gate fidelity are derived for weak noise covering experimental relevant
regime. We also perform interleaved two-qubit randomized benchmarking analysis
for the controlled phase gate and show that an exponential decay of the
sequential fidelity is still valid for the weak noise.

<h3>Experimental demonstration of a Two-Dimensional Hole Gas (2DHG) in a  GaN/AlGaN/GaN based heterostructure by optical spectroscopy</h3>

<i>Loïc Méchin, François Médard, Joël Leymarie, Sophie Bouchoule, Jean-Yves Duboz, Blandine Alloing, Jesús Zuñiga-Pérez, Pierre Disseix</i>
<p>The polarization discontinuity across interfaces in polar nitride-based
heterostructures can lead to the formation of two-dimensional electron and hole
gases. In the past, the observation of these electron and hole gases has been
achieved through various experimental techniques, most often by electronic
measurements but occasionally by optical means. However, the occurrence of a
two-dimensional hole gas has never been demonstrated optically. The objective
of this article is to demonstrate, thanks to the combination of various optical
spectroscopy techniques coupled to numerical simulations, the presence of a
two-dimensional hole gas in a GaN/AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. This is made
possible thanks to a GaN/AlGaN/GaN heterostructure displaying a
micrometer-thick AlGaN layer and a GaN cap thicker than in conventional
GaN-based HEMTs structures. The band structure across the whole heterostructure
was established by solving self-consistently the Schr\"odinger and Poisson
equations and by taking into account the experimentally determined strain state
of each layer. Continuous and quasi-continuos photoluminescence reveal the
presence of a broad emission band at an energy around 50 meV below the exciton
emission and whose energy blueshifts with increasing excitation power density,
until it is completely quenched due to the complete screening of the internal
electric field. Time-resolved measurements show that the emission arising from
the two-dimensional hole gas can be assigned to the recombination of holes in
the potential well with electrons located in the top GaN as well as electron
from the bottom AlGaN, each of them displaying different decay times due to
unequal electric fields. Besides the optical demonstration of a two-dimensional
hole gas in a nitride-based heterostructure, our work highlights the optical
recombination processes involved in the emission from such a hole gas.

<h3>Collective dynamics and long-range order in thermal neuristor networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuan-Hang Zhang, Chesson Sipling, Erbin Qiu, Ivan K. Schuller, Massimiliano Di Ventra</i>
<p>In the pursuit of scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic devices, recent
research has unveiled a novel category of spiking oscillators, termed ``thermal
neuristors." These devices function via thermal interactions among neighboring
vanadium dioxide resistive memories, closely mimicking the behavior of
biological neurons. Here, we show that the collective dynamical behavior of
networks of these neurons showcases a rich phase structure, tunable by
adjusting the thermal coupling and input voltage. Notably, we have identified
phases exhibiting long-range order that, however, does not arise from
criticality, but rather from the time non-local response of the system. In
addition, we show that these thermal neuristor arrays achieve high accuracy in
image recognition tasks through reservoir computing, without taking advantage
of this long-range order. Our findings highlight a crucial aspect of
neuromorphic computing with possible implications on the functioning of the
brain: criticality may not be necessary for the efficient performance of
neuromorphic systems in certain computational tasks.

<h3>On the validity of some equilibrium models for thermodiffusion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12912" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12912</a>
<br>
<i>Mario Araujo-Rocha, Alejandro Diaz-Marquez, Guillaume Stirnemann</i>
<p>When applied to binary solutions, thermal gradients lead to the generation of
concentration-gradients and thus to inhomogeneous systems. While being known
for more than 150 years, the molecular origins for this phenomenon are still
debated, and there is no consensus on the underlying physical models or
theories that could explain the amplitude of the concentration gradient in
response to a given temperature gradients. Notably, there have been some
attempts to relate this non-equilibrium, steady-state manifestation, to
equilibrium properties of these solutions, for example, to the temperature
dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient or to the solvation free-energies
of each of their components. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations on
dilute solutions containing molecular size solutes, both in a thermophoretic
setting as well as under equilibrium conditions, to test the validity of such
models. We show that these approaches are inadequate and lead to completely
uncorrelated estimates as compared to those based on the out-of-equilibrium
measurements. Crucially, they fail to explain the strong mass-dependence (to
which thermodynamics or single particle diffusion are insensitive) observed in
the simulations and measured in the experiments. However, our results suggest
an interesting correlation between the amplitude of the short-time molecular
motion and that of the concentration-gradient that would deserve future
investigations.

<h3>Ground state phase diagram and "parity flipping'' microwave transitions  in a gate-tunable Josephson Junction</h3>

<p>We probed a gate-tunable InAs nanowire Josephson weak link by coupling it to
a microwave resonator. Tracking the resonator frequency shift when the weak
link is close to pinch-off, we observe that the ground state of the latter
alternates between a singlet and a doublet when varying either the gate voltage
or the superconducting phase difference across it. The corresponding microwave
absorption spectra display lines that approach zero energy close to the
singlet-doublet boundaries, suggesting parity flipping transitions, which are
in principle forbidden in microwave spectroscopy and expected to arise only in
tunnel spectroscopy. We tentatively interpret them by means of an ancillary
state isolated in the junction acting as a reservoir for individual electrons.

<h3>Fermi arcs, Landau levels and magnetic response of the nematic Weyl  liquid</h3>

<br>
<i>Carlos Naya, Tommaso Bertolini, Johan Carlström</i>
<p>In classes of Weyl semimetals where the symmetry protects nodes with higher
than unit charge, the nematic Weyl liquid appears as interactions destroy this
underlying symmetry. In the symmetry-broken phase, the multiple-charge nodes
are split into objects of unit charge, the position of which in momentum space
is determined by the nematic order parameter. We examine the phenomenology of
this phase, focusing on topological edge states and Landau levels. We find that
the symmetry-broken phase itself, as well as the orientation of the nematic
order, are identifiable from the resulting edge states. We also find that the
nematic order couples to an in-plane magnetic field, indicating that it can be
controlled in situ via an external field. Finally, we provide an estimate for
the critical coupling where spontaneous symmetry-breaking occurs for contact
interaction.

<h3>Heterogeneous structure and dynamics of water in a hydrated collagen  microfibril</h3>

<i>Maxime Vassaux, Aziz Ghoufi, Franck Artzner</i>
<p>Collagen, type I in particular, is the protein of choice by Nature to design
structural materials. Its hierarchical fibrillar structure confers to collagen
its outstanding mechanical properties. Nonetheless, fibrillar collagen may
rather be viewed as a composite material made of protein, macromolecules (such
as glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans) and water. Yet, the properties of
water and the fine interactions of water with the protein constituent of these
nanocomposites have only received limited attention. Here, we propose to
investigate in-depth water structure and dynamics confined within the
microfibril crystal structure of collagen type I to establish its impact on the
properties of collagen. We found that the properties of water vary strongly
with the level of hydration of the crystal, and spatially along the long axis
of the crystal, namely moving from the so-called gap region to the so-called
overlap region. In short, at low hydration, water acts as a glue between
protein chains; while at high hydration, water acts as a lubricant. Beyond
self-assembly and properties of fibrillar collagen, such heterogeneous
structure and anisotropic dynamics may control its biomineralization and the
properties of biological tissues such as bone.

<h3>Order-by-disorder in the antiferromagnetic long-range transverse-field  Ising model on the ruby lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Duft, J.A. Koziol, P. Adelhardt, M. Mühlhauser, K.P. Schmidt</i>
<p>We demonstrate that geometric frustration and long-range interactions both
promote order-by-disorder in the antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model
on the ruby lattice. To this end we investigate the quantum phase diagram for
truncated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising interactions. In the low-field limit we
derive an effective quantum dimer model, analyzing how the extensive
ground-state degeneracy at zero field is lifted by two distinct
order-by-disorder scenarios. We support our analysis by studying the
gap-closing of the high-field phase using series expansions. For $J_2>J_3$, we
find an emergent clock-ordered phase at low fields, stabilized by resonating
plaquettes, and a 3d-XY quantum phase transition to the polarized high-field
phase. For $J_3>J_2$, an order-by-disorder mechanism stabilizes a distinct
$k=(0,0)$ order and a quantum phase transition in the 3d-Ising universality
class is observed. In contrast to the triangular lattice, on the ruby lattice
algebraically decaying long-range interactions favor the clock-ordered
low-field phase and therefore allow a robust implementation in existing Rydberg
atom quantum simulators.

<h3>Electron-tunneling-induced thermoelectric effects</h3>

<br>
<i>Mauricio Gómez Viloria, Riccardo Messina, Philippe Ben-Abdallah</i>
<p>We introduce a direct (Seebeck) and inverse (Peltier) thermolectric effect
induced by electron tunneling between closely separated conducting films. When
a transverse temperature gradient is applied along one of two films, a bias
voltage is induced in the second thanks to the heat transfer mediated by
electrons tunneling through the separation gap. We highlight a non trivial
behavior for this Seebeck effect with respect to geometric characteristics of
interacting films. Conversely, when an electric current passes through one of
two films a strong thermal power can be removed from or inserted in the second
film through an induced Peltier effect. In particular we highlight conditions
where the induced Seebeck and Peltier coefficients are larger than in the bulk.
These induced thermoelectric effects could find broad applications in the
fields of energy conversion and cooling at nanoscale.

<p>The space- and temperature-dependent electron distribution $n(r,T)$
determines optoelectronic properties of disordered semiconductors. It is a
challenging task to get access to $n(r,T)$ in random potentials, avoiding the
time-consuming numerical solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We present
several numerical techniques targeted to fulfill this task. For a degenerate
system with Fermi statistics, a numerical approach based on a matrix inversion
and that based on a system of linear equations are developed. For a
non-degenerate system with Boltzmann statistics, a numerical technique based on
a universal low-pass filter and one based on random wave functions are
introduced. The high accuracy of the approximate calculations are checked by
comparison with the exact quantum-mechanical solutions.

of pentacene with respect to the underlying substrate crystal structure. We

<p>Eddy currents in a superconductor shield the magnetic field in its interior
and are responsible for the formation of a magnetic stray field outside of the

superconducting strip placed over a magnetic layer, we predict theoretically
the confinement of spin waves in the well of the static stray field. The number

<i>Alessio Zaccone, Vladimir M. Fomin</i>
<p>The supercurrent field effect is experimentally realized in various
nano-scale devices, based on the superconductivity suppression by external
electric fields being effective for confined systems. In spite of intense
research, a microscopic theory and explanation of this effect is missing. Here,
a microscopic theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in thin films is
presented, which accounts for the effect of quantum confinement on the
electronic density of states, on the Fermi energy, and on the topology of
allowed states in momentum space. By further accounting for the interplay
between quantum confinement, the external static electric field, the
Thomas-Fermi screening in the electron-phonon matrix element, and the effect of
confinement on the Coulomb repulsion parameter, the theory predicts the
critical value of the external electric field as a function of the film
thickness, above which superconductivity is suppressed. In particular, this
critical value of the electric field is the lower the thinner the film, in
agreement with recent experimental observations. Crucially, this effect is
predicted by the theory when both Thomas-Fermi screening and the Coulomb
pseudopotential are taken into account, along with the respective dependence on
thin film thickness. This microscopic theory of the supercurrent field-effect
opens up new possibilities for electric-field gated quantum materials.

<i>Andrea Cavagna, Javier Cristín, Irene Giardina, Mario Veca</i>
<p>Numerical analysis of conserved field dynamics has been generally performed
with pseudo spectral methods. Finite differences integration, the common
procedure for non-conserved field dynamics, indeed struggles to implement a
conservative noise in the discrete spatial domain. In this work, we present a
novel method to generate a conservative noise in the finite differences
framework, which works for any discrete topology and boundary conditions. We
apply it to numerically solve the conserved Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (cKPZ)
equation, widely used to describe surface roughening when the number of
particles is conserved. Our numerical simulations recover the correct scaling
exponents $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $z$ in $d=1$ and in $d=2$. To illustrate the
potentiality of the method, we further consider the cKPZ equation on different
kinds of non-standard lattices and on the random Euclidean graph. This is the
first numerical study of conserved field dynamics on an irregular topology,
paving the way to a broad spectrum of possible applications.

<p>We investigate the vibrational and magnetic properties of thin layers of
chromium tribromide (CrBr$_3$) with a thickness ranging from three to twenty
layers (3~L to 20~L) revealed by the Raman scattering (RS) technique.
Systematic dependence of the RS process efficiency on the energy of the laser
excitation is explored for four different excitation energies: 1.96 eV, 2.21
eV, 2.41 eV, and 3.06 eV. Our characterization demonstrates that for 12 L
CrBr$_3$, 3.06~eV excitation could be considered resonant with interband
electronic transitions due to the enhanced intensity of the Raman-active
scattering resonances and the qualitative change in the Raman spectra.
Polarization-resolved RS measurements for 12 L CrBr$_3$ and first-principles
calculations allow us to identify five observable phonon modes characterized by
distinct symmetries, classified as the A$_\textrm{g}$ and E$_\textrm{g}$ modes.
The evolution of phonon modes with temperature for a 20 L CrBr$_3$ encapsulated
in hexagonal boron nitride flakes demonstrates alterations of phonon energies
and/or linewidths of resonances indicative of a transition between the
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic state at Curie temperature ($T_\textrm{C}
\approx 50$ K). The exploration of the effects of thickness on the phonon
energies demonstrated small variations pronounces exclusively for the thinnest
layers in the vicinity of 3 - 5 L. This observation is attributed to strong
localization in the real space of interband electronic excitations, limiting
the effects of confinement for resonantly excited Raman modes to atomically
thin layers.

of the existence of two phases at zero temperature: a Luttinger liquid (LL) and
an antiferromagnetic phase (AFM), separated by a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) phase transition. While the bath is responsible for the LL-AFM transition
for subohmic baths, the LL-AFM transition for superohmic baths is due to the
interactions within the spin chain.

<p>Adiabatic processes can keep the quantum system in its instantaneous
eigenstate, which is robust to noises and dissipation. However, it is limited
by sufficiently slow evolution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the
transitionless quantum driving (TLQD) of the shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in
gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) to greatly accelerate the
conventional adiabatic passage for the first time. For a given efficiency of
quantum state transfer, the acceleration can be more than 2-fold. The dynamic
properties also prove that the TLQD can guarantee fast and high-fidelity
quantum state transfer. In order to compensate for the diabatic errors caused
by dephasing noises, the modified TLQD is proposed and demonstrated in
experiment by enlarging the width of the counter-diabatic drivings. The
benchmarking shows that the state transfer fidelity of 97.8% can be achieved.
This work will greatly promote researches and applications about quantum
simulations and adiabatic quantum computation based on the gate-defined QDs.

<h3>Optimal half-metal band structure for large thermoelectric performance</h3>

<p>Half-metal ferromagnets were predicted [in IEEE Trans. Mag. 51, 1 (2015)] to
give large thermoelectric performance in anti-parallel spin valve
configuration. Despite being metals that suffer from the Wiedemann-Franz law,
the additional spin degrees of freedom allow for tuning of the thermoelectric
properties due to the spin-valve enhancement factor (SVEF). We test this theory
and find a mismatch of parameters that gives large TE performance and large
SVEF. As a result, we show that the spin-valve setup is useful only for gapless
HMF with initially poor TE performance. To obtain the largest TE performance,
one still needs to open the band gap.

<h3>Tunable Andreev-Conversion of Single-Electron Charge Pulses</h3>

<br>
<i>Pablo Burset, Benjamin Roussel, Michael Moskalets, Christian Flindt</i>
<p>Electron quantum optics explores the coherent propagation and interference of
single-electron charge pulses in electronic nanoscale circuits that are similar
to table-top setups with photons. So far, experiments with dynamic
single-electron emitters have focused on normal-state conductors, however, the
inclusion of superconductors would pave the way for a wide range of
applications that exploit the electron-hole degree of freedom, for example, for
quantum information processing or quantum sensing. Here, we propose and analyze
a tunable mechanism for the on-demand conversion of single-electron pulses into
holes through Andreev processes on a superconductor. To this end, we develop a
Floquet-Nambu scattering formalism that allows us to describe the dynamic
conversion of charge pulses on a superconductor, and we show that it is
possible to generate arbitrary superpositions of electrons and holes with the
degree of mixing controlled by the magnetic flux in an interferometric setup.
We provide a detailed discussion of the optimal operating conditions in
realistic situations and demonstrate that our proposal is feasible based on
current technology.

<h3>Microscopic model for a Brownian Translator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13158</a>
<br>
<i>Bart Wijns, Ralf Eichhorn, Bart Cleuren</i>
<p>A microscopic model for a translational Brownian motor, dubbed as Brownian
Translator, is introduced. It is inspired by the Brownian Gyrator of Filliger
and Reimann (Filliger and Reimann 2007). The Brownian Translator consists of a
spatially asymmetric object moving freely along a line due to perpetual
collisions with a surrounding ideal gas. When this gas has an anisotropic
temperature, both spatial and temporal symmetries are broken and the object
acquires a nonzero drift. Onsager reciprocity implies the opposite phenomenon,
that is dragging a spatially asymmetric object in an (initially at) equilibrium
gas induces an energy flow that results in anisotropic gas temperatures.
Expressions for the dynamical and energetic properties are derived as a series
expansion in the mass ratio (of gas particle vs. object). These results are in
excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations.

<h3>Dynamic evolution of internal stress, grain growth, and crystallographic  texture in arc-evaporated AlTiN thin films using in-situ synchrotron x-ray  diffraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13160" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13160</a>
<br>
<i>Sanjay Nayak, Tun-Wei Hsu, Robert Boyd, Jens Gibmeier, Norbert Schell, Jens Birch, Lina Rogström, Magnus Odén</i>
<p>Understanding the nucleation and growth of polycrystalline thin films is a
long-standing goal. Polycrystalline films have many grains with different
orientations that affect thin-film properties. Numerous studies have been done
to determine these grain size and their preferred crystallographic orientation
as well as stress in films. However most past studies have either employed an
ex-situ methodology or only monitor the development of macroscopic stress in
real-time. There has never been any research done on the simultaneous
determination of crystallographic texture, grain size, and microscopic stress
in polycrystalline thin films. In this study, we simultaneously monitored the
generation and temporal evolution of texture, grain size, and internal stress
in cathodic arc evaporated Al0.50Ti0.50N thin films using a bespoke deposition
apparatus designed for use with 2-dimensional synchrotron x-ray diffraction
technique. The influence of the substrate temperature is investigated in terms
of the emergence and development of texture, grain size and stress evolution. A
dynamic evolution of the crystallographic texture is observed as the overall
film thickness varies. We clearly resolved two regime of films growth based on
stress evolution. Beyond a threshold grain size (~ 14 nm), the stress scales
inversely to the average grain sizes, and as the film thickness increases,
immediate compressive stress relaxation was seen. An extensive ex-situ
evaluation of thin films using electron microscopies and electron diffraction
was performed to support the in-situ x-ray diffraction results.

<h3>From Resistance Minimum to Kondo Physics</h3>

<i>Takashi Yanagisawa</i>
<p>We discuss the development of Kondo physics from the resolution of the
resistance minimum by J. Kondo to recent developments in physics. The Kondo
effect has given a great impact to all areas of physics. This reminds us that
physics is one unified science. Kondo's pioneering work has led major
developments in physics. We show brief history of the Kondo effect and discuss
the Kondo effect from several points of view that appeared to be important
through conversations with Prof. J. Kondo.

<h3>Rotational states of an asymmetric vortex pair with mass imbalance in  binary condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13187</a>
<br>
<i>Alice Bellettini, Andrea Richaud, Vittorio Penna</i>
<p>We consider massive vortices in binary condensates, where the immiscibility
condition entails the trapping of the minority component in the vortex cores of
the majority component. We study such vortices by means of a 2D point-like
model, and show how the relevant dynamical equations exhibit vortex-pair
solutions characterized by different vortex masses and circular orbits of
different radii $a$ and $b$. These solutions are validated by the simulations
of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations for binary condensates. After examining the
properties of vortex-pair rotational frequency $\Omega$ as a function of the
vortex masses for a given pair geometry, we define the rotational-state diagram
$\cal D$, describing all the possible vortex-pair solutions in terms of the
orbit radii at given $\Omega$. This includes solutions with equal-mass pairs
but $a \ne b$ or with one of the two masses (or both) equal to zero. Also, we
analytically find the minimum value of $\Omega$ for the existence of such
solutions, and obtain numerically the critical frequency $\Omega_c$ below which
$\cal D$ changes its structure and the transition to an unstable vortex-pair
regime takes place. Our work highlights an indirect measurement scheme to infer
the vortex masses from orbits radii $a$ and $b$, and a link between the vortex
masses and the vortex-pair small-oscillation properties.

<h3>Relating absorbing and hard wall boundary conditions for active  particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13200" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13200</a>
<br>
<i>Mathis Guéneau, Léo Touzo</i>
<p>The connection between absorbing boundary conditions and hard walls is well
established in the mathematical literature for a variety of stochastic models,
including for instance the Brownian motion. In this paper we explore this
duality for a different type of process which is of particular interest in
physics and biology, namely active particles. For a general model of an active
particle in one dimension, we provide a relation between the exit probability,
i.e. the probability that the particle exits an interval from a given boundary
before a certain time $t$, and the cumulative distribution of its position in
the presence of hard walls at the same time $t$. We illustrate this relation
for a run-and-tumble particle in the stationary state by explicitly computing
both quantities.

<h3>Non-linear photoconductivity of strongly driven graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13217</a>
<br>
<i>Lukas Broers, Ludwig Mathey</i>
<p>We present the non-linear DC photoconductivity of graphene under strong
infra-red (IR) radiation. The photoconductivity is obtained as the response to
a strong DC electric field, with field strengths outside of the linear-response
regime, while the IR radiation is described by a strong AC electric field. The
conductivity displays two distinct regimes in which either the DC or the AC
field dominates. We explore these regimes and associate them with the dynamics
of driven Landau-Zener quenches in the case of a large DC field. In the limit
of large AC field, we describe the conductivity in a Floquet picture and
compare the results to the closely related Tien-Gordon effect. We present
analytical calculations for the non-linear differential photoconductivity, for
both regimes based on the corresponding mechanisms. As part of this discussion
of the non-equilibrium state of graphene, we present analytical estimates of
the conductivity of undriven graphene as a function of temperature and DC bias
field strength that show very good agreement with our simulations.

<h3>Edge zeros and boundary spinons in topological Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13226" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13226</a>
<br>
<i>Niklas Wagner, Daniele Guerci, Andrew J. Millis, Giorgio Sangiovanni</i>
<p>We introduce a real-space slave rotor theory of the physics of topological
Mott insulators, using the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model as an example, and use it to
show that a topological gap in the Green function zeros corresponds to a gap in
the bulk spinon spectrum and that a zero edge mode corresponds to a spinon edge
mode. We then consider an interface between a topological Mott insulator and a
conventional topological insulator showing how the spinon edge mode of the
topological Mott insulator combines with the spin part of the conventional
electron topological edge state leaving a non-Fermi liquid edge mode described
by a gapless propagating holon and gapped spinon state. Our work demonstrates
the physical meaning of Green function zeros and shows that interfaces between
conventional and Mott topological insulators are a rich source of new physics.

<h3>Local readout and control of current and kinetic energy operators in  optical lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander Impertro, Simon Karch, Julian F. Wienand, SeungJung Huh, Christian Schweizer, Immanuel Bloch, Monika Aidelsburger</i>
<p>Quantum gas microscopes have revolutionized quantum simulations with
ultracold atoms, allowing to measure local observables and snapshots of quantum
states. However, measurements so far were mostly carried out in the occupation
basis. Here, we demonstrate how all kinetic operators, such as kinetic energy
or current operators, can be measured and manipulated with single bond
resolution. Beyond simple expectation values of these observables, the
single-shot measurements allow to access full counting statistics and complex
correlation functions. Our work paves the way for the implementation of
efficient quantum state tomography and hybrid quantum computing protocols for
itinerant particles on a lattice. In addition, we demonstrate how site-resolved
programmable potentials enable a spatially-selective, parallel readout in
different bases as well as the engineering of arbitrary initial states.
