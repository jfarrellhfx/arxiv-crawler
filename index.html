<h3>Machine Learning the Operator Content of the Critical Self-Dual  Ising-Higgs Gauge Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17994" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17994</a>
<br>
<i>Lior Oppenheim, Maciej Koch-Janusz, Snir Gazit, Zohar Ringel</i>
<p>We study the critical properties of the Ising-Higgs gauge theory in $(2+1)D$
along the self-dual line which have recently been a subject of debate. For the
first time, using machine learning techniques, we determine the low energy
operator content of the associated field theory. Our approach enables us to
largely refute the existence of an emergent current operator and with it the
standing conjecture that this transition is of the $XY^*$ universality class.
We contrast these results with the ones obtained for the $(2+1)D$ Ashkin-Teller
transverse field Ising model where we find the expected current operator. Our
numerical technique extends the recently proposed Real-Space Mutual Information
allowing us to extract sub-leading non-linear operators. This allows a
controlled and computationally scalable approach to target CFT spectrum and
discern universality classes beyond $(1+1)D$ from Monte Carlo data.

<h3>Exact fixed-point tensor network construction for rational conformal  field theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18005" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18005</a>
<br>
<i>Gong Cheng, Lin Chen, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Ling-Yan Hung</i>
<p>The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding
tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in
developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme for
classical 2D systems or $(1+1)$D quantum systems. Numerically approximate
fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the
underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this
paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D
rational CFT (RCFT). We define it as a correlation function between the
"boundary-changing operators" on triangles. Our construction fully captures all
the real-space RG conditions. We also provide a concrete example using the
Ising model to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the
corresponding FP tensor. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is
closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture
naturally emerges.

<h3>Superconductivity due to fluctuating loop currents</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18019" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18019</a>
<br>
<i>Grgur Palle, Risto Ojajärvi, Rafael M. Fernandes, Jörg Schmalian</i>
<p>Orbital magnetism and the loop currents (LC) that accompany it have been
proposed to emerge in many systems, including cuprates, iridates, and kagome
superconductors. In the case of cuprates, LCs have been put forward as the
driving force behind the pseudogap, strange-metal behavior, and
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity. Here, we investigate whether fluctuating
intra-unit-cell loop currents can cause unconventional superconductivity. For
odd-parity LCs, we find that they are strongly repulsive in all pairing
channels near the underlying quantum-critical point (QCP). For even-parity LCs,
their fluctuations do give rise to unconventional pairing. However, this
pairing is not amplified in the vicinity of the QCP, in sharp contrast to other
known cases of pairing mediated by intra-unit-cell order parameters, such as
spin-magnetic, nematic, or ferroelectric ones. Applying our formalism to the
cuprates, we conclude that pairing mediated by fluctuating intra-unit-cell LCs
is unlikely to yield $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity. We also show that
loop currents, if relevant for the cuprates, must vary between unit cells and
break translation symmetry.

<h3>Ferroelectric Semimetals with $α$-Bi/SnSe van der Waals  heterostructures and its Topological Currents</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18026</a>
<br>
<i>D. J. P. de Sousa, Seungjun Lee, Qiangsheng Lu, Rob G. Moore, Matthew Brahlek, J-.P. Wang, Guang Bian, Tony Low</i>
<p>We show that proximity effects can be utilized to engineer van der Waals
heterostructures (vd- WHs) displaying spin-ferroelectricity locking, where
ferroelectricity and spin states are confined to different layers, but are
correlated by means of proximity effects. Our findings are supported by first
principles calculations in $\alpha$-Bi/SnSe bilayers. We show that such systems
support ferroelectrically switchable non-linear anomalous Hall effect
originating from large Berry curvature dipoles as well as direct and inverse
spin Hall effects with giant bulk spin-charge interconversion efficiencies. The
giant efficiencies are consequences of the proximity-induced semimetallic
nature of low energy electron states, which are shown to behave as
two-dimensional pseudo-Weyl fermions by means of symmetry analysis, first
principles calculations as well as direct angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy measurements.

<h3>Lateral NbS$_2$/MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ transistors: physical modeling and  performance assessment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18031" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18031</a>
<br>
<i>Giuseppe Lovarelli, Fabrizio Mazziotti, Demetrio Logoteta, Giuseppe Iannaccone</i>
<p>Reducing the contact resistance of field-effect transistors based on
two-dimensional materials is one of the key improvements required to to enable
the integration of such transistors in an industrially relevant process.
Suitably designed lateral heterojunctions provide an opportunity to
independently tailor the contact and channel properties and to mitigate the
problem of high contact resistance. Inspired by the recent experimental
demonstration of a two-dimensional $p$-type Schottky barrier, here we use
quantum transport simulations to estimate the performance of $p$-type
transistors in which the channel consists of a lateral heterostructure of
NbS$_2$/MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ (semimetal-semiconductor-semimetal). We find that the
gate alignment with the channel is a critical design parameter, strongly
influencing the capability of the gate to modulate the Schottky barrier at the
MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ interfaces. This effect is also found to significantly affect
the scaling behavior of the device.

<h3>Probability Currents in Out-of-Equilibrium Microwave Circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18052" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18052</a>
<br>
<i>Alexandre Dumont, Pierre Février, Christian Lupien, Bertrand Reulet</i>
<p>In this work we reconstruct the probability current in phase space of
out-of-equilibrium microwave circuits. This is achieved by a statistical
analysis of short-time correlations in time domain measurements. It allows us
to check locally in phase space the violation of detailed balance or the
presence of fluctuation loops. We present the data analysis methods and
experimental results for several microwave circuits driven by two noise sources
in the 4-8GHz frequency range.

<h3>Observation of an electronic microemulsion phase emerging from a quantum  crystal-to-liquid transition</h3>

<p>Strongly interacting electronic systems possess rich phase diagrams resulting
from the competition between different quantum ground states. A general
mechanism that relieves this frustration is the emergence of microemulsion
phases, where regions of different phase self-organize across multiple length
scales. The experimental characterization of these phases often poses
significant challenges, as the long-range Coulomb interaction microscopically
mingles the competing states. Here, we use cryogenic reflectance and
magneto-optical spectroscopy to observe the signatures of the mixed state
between an electronic Wigner crystal and an electron liquid in a MoSe2
monolayer. We find that the transit into this 'microemulsion' state is marked
by anomalies in exciton reflectance, spin susceptibility, and Umklapp
scattering, establishing it as a distinct phase of electronic matter. Our study
of the two-dimensional electronic microemulsion phase elucidates the physics of
novel correlated electron states with strong Coulomb interactions.

<h3>Relaxation in dipolar spin ladders: from pair production to false-vacuum  decay</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18091" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18091</a>
<br>
<i>G. A. Domínguez-Castro, Thomas Bilitewski, David Wellnitz, Ana Maria Rey, Luis Santos</i>
<p>Ultracold dipolar particles pinned in optical lattices or tweezers provide an
excellent platform for studying out-of-equilibrium quantum magnetism with
dipole-mediated couplings. Starting with an initial state with spins of
opposite orientation in each of the legs of a ladder lattice, we show that spin
relaxation displays an unexpected dependence on inter-leg distance and dipole
orientation. This intricate dependence, stemming from the interplay between
intra- and inter-leg interactions, results in three distinct dynamical regimes:
(i) ergodic, characterized by the fast relaxation towards equilibrium of
correlated pairs of excitations generated at exponentially fast rates from the
initial state; (ii) metastable, in which the state is quasi-localized in the
initial state and only decays at exceedingly long timescales, resembling false
vacuum decay; and, surprisingly, (iii) partially-relaxed, with coexisting fast
partial relaxation and very long-lived partial quasi-localization. Realizing
these intriguing dynamics is within reach of current state-of-the-art
experiments in dipolar gases.

<h3>Quantitative evaluation of methods to analyze motion changes in  single-particle experiments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18100" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18100</a>
<br>
<i>Gorka Muñoz, Harshith Bachimanchi, Jesús Pineda, Benjamin Midtvedt, Maciej Lewenstein, Ralf Metzler, Diego Krapf, Giovanni Volpe, Carlo Manzo</i>
<p>The analysis of live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments can reveal
valuable information about the heterogeneity of transport processes and
interactions between cell components. These characteristics are seen as motion
changes in the particle trajectories. Despite the existence of multiple
approaches to carry out this type of analysis, no objective assessment of these
methods has been performed so far. Here, we have designed a competition to
characterize and rank the performance of these methods when analyzing the
dynamic behavior of single molecules. To run this competition, we have
implemented a software library to simulate realistic data corresponding to
widespread diffusion and interaction models, both in the form of trajectories
and videos obtained in typical experimental conditions. The competition will
constitute the first assessment of these methods, provide insights into the
current limits of the field, foster the development of new approaches, and
guide researchers to identify optimal tools for analyzing their experiments.

<h3>Generic proving of replica symmetry breaking</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18106</a>
<br>
<i>Mihailo Stojnic</i>
<p>We study the replica symmetry breaking (rsb) concepts on a generic level
through the prism of recently introduced interpolating/comparison mechanisms
for bilinearly indexed (bli) random processes. In particular,
\cite{Stojnicnflgscompyx23} introduced a \emph{fully lifted} (fl) interpolating
mechanism and \cite{Stojnicsflgscompyx23} developed its a \emph{stationarized
fully lifted} (sfl) variant. Here, we present a sfl \emph{matching} mechanism
that shows that the results obtained in
\cite{Stojnicnflgscompyx23,Stojnicsflgscompyx23} completely correspond to the
ones obtained by a statistical physics replica tool with the replica symmetry
breaking (rsb) form suggested by Parisi in \cite{Par79,Parisi80,Par80}. The
results are very generic as they allow to handle pretty much all bilinear
models at once. Moreover, given that the results of
\cite{Stojnicnflgscompyx23,Stojnicsflgscompyx23} are extendable to many other
forms, the concepts presented here automatically extend to any such forms as
well.

<h3>Emergence of multiphase condensates from a limited set of chemical  building blocks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18142" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18142</a>
<br>
<i>Fan Chen, William M. Jacobs</i>
<p>Biomolecules composed of a limited set of chemical building blocks can
co-localize into distinct, spatially segregated compartments known as
biomolecular condensates. Although recent studies of intracellular condensates
have shown that coexisting, immiscible condensates can form spontaneously via
phase separation, it has remained unclear how coexisting and multiphase
condensates assemble from chemical building blocks with limited specificity.
Here we establish a connection between the interdependencies among biomolecular
interactions and the thermodynamic stability of multiphase condensates. We then
introduce an inverse design approach for computing the minimum interaction
specificity required to assemble condensates with prescribed molecular
compositions in a multicomponent biomolecular mixture. As a proof of principle,
we apply our theory to design mixtures of model heteropolymers using a minimal
number of distinct monomer types, and we use molecular simulations to verify
that our designs produce coexisting condensates with the target molecular
compositions. Our theoretical approach explains how multiphase condensates
arise in naturally occurring biomolecular mixtures and provides a rational
algorithm for engineering complex artificial condensates from simple chemical
building blocks.

<h3>Random Green's function method for large-scale electronic structure  calculation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18161" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18161</a>
<br>
<i>Mingfa Tang, Chang Liu, Aixia Zhang, Qingyun Zhang, Shengjun Yuan, Youqi Ke</i>
<p>We report a linear-scaling random Green's function (rGF) method for
large-scale electronic structure calculation. In this method, the rGF is
defined on a set of random states to stochastically express the density matrix,
and rGF is calculated with the linear-scaling computational cost. We show the
rGF method is generally applicable to the nonorthogonal localized basis, and
circumvent the large Chebyshev expansion for the density matrix. As a
demonstration, we implement rGF with density-functional Tight-Binding method
and apply it to self-consistently calculate water clusters up 9984 H2Os. We
find the rGF method combining with a simple fragment correction can reach an
error of ~1meV per H2O in total energy, compared to the deterministic
calculations, due to the self-average. The development of rGF method advances
the stochastic electronic structure theory to a new stage of the efficiency and
applicability.

<h3>An extended Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (EKAI) model to simulate dynamic  characteristics of polycrystalline-ferroelectric-gate field-effect  transistors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18178</a>
<br>
<i>Shigeki Sakai, Mitsue Takahashi</i>
<p>An extended Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (EKAI) model is proposed, which
represents dynamic characteristics in polycrystalline ferroelectric films
consisting of grains under time-dependent electric fields. The original
Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) model described time-varying polarization
reversal in a single-crystal film under a constant electric field. The field
and the polarization were directed along the film normal. The polarization
reversal dynamics were represented by a time-evolution function, c(t),
regarding the volume fractions of the downward- and upward-polarization domains
under a constant electric field. In the EKAI model, a grain in a
polycrystalline ferroelectric film is indexed by l with an angle theta which is
the angle between the spontaneous polarization Ps and the film normal. The EKAI
model first assumes KAI-like polarization variations under a constant field
inside the grain whose angle is tilted by theta. The second assumption is
concerned with polarization variation under time-varying electric field. During
a time period delta_t from t_now to t_next (=t_now+delta_t), the volume
fractions of the downward- and upward-polarization domains changes according to
the function c(t) under an electric field at t_now. By combining the derived
polarization and an electrostatic potential equation across a gate stacked
structure at t_next, an electric field at t_next is derived. Since the electric
field and the volume fractions of the downward and upward domains are known at
t_next, the calculation at the next delta_t step is possible. This procedure is
repeated, and the EKAI model can simulate time-varying polarization reversal
phenomena. Good agreement of the numerical results with the experimental
indicates that the model is appropriate to simulate dynamic characteristics of
FeFETs with polycrystalline ferroelectric films under swept and pulsed
gate-voltages.

<h3>Extraordinary magnetic response of an anisotropic 2D antiferromagnet via  site-dilution</h3>

<br>
<i>Junyi Yang, Hidemaro Suwa, Derek. Meyers, Han Zhang, Lukas Horak, Zhan Zhang, Jenia Karapetrova, Jong-Woo Kim, Philip J. Ryan, Mark. P. M. Dean, Lin Hao, Jian Liu</i>
<p>A prominent character of two-dimensional magnetic systems is the enhanced
spin fluctuations, which however reduce the ordering temperature. Here we
report that a magnetic field of only one-thousandth of the Heisenberg
superexchange interaction can induce a crossover, which for practical purposes
is the effective ordering transition, at temperatures about 6 times of the Neel
transition in a site-diluted two-dimensional anisotropic quantum
antiferromagnet. Such a strong magnetic response is enabled because the system
directly enters the antiferromagnetically ordered state from the isotropic
disordered state skipping the intermediate anisotropic stage. The underlying
mechanism is achieved on a pseudospin-half square lattice realized in the
[(SrIrO3)1/(SrTiO3)2] superlattice thin film that is designed to linearly
couple the staggered magnetization to external magnetic fields by virtue of the
rotational symmetry-preserving Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. Our model
analysis shows that the skipping of the anisotropic regime despite the finite
anisotropy is due to the enhanced isotropic fluctuations under moderate
dilution.

<h3>A Novel Interface Database of Graphene Nanoribbon from Density  Functional Theory</h3>

<i>Ao Wu, Jiangxue Huang, Qijun Huang, Jin He, Hao Wang, Sheng Chang</i>
<p>Interfaces play a crucial role in determining the overall performance and
functionality of electronic devices and systems. Driven by the data science,
machine learning (ML) reveals excellent guidance for material selection and
device design, in which an advanced database is crucial for training models
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) precision. However, a systematic database of
interfaces is still in its infancy due to the difficulties in collecting raw
data in experiment and the expensive first-principles computational cost in
density functional theory (DFT). In this paper, we construct ample interface
structures of graphene nanoribbons (GNR), whose interfacial morphology can be
precisely fabricated based on specific molecular precursors. The GNR interfaces
serve as promising candidates since their bandgaps can be modulated. Their
physical properties including energy bands and density of states (DOS) maps are
obtained under reasonable calculation parameters. This database can provide
theoretical guidance for the design of electronic devices and accelerate the ML
study of various physical quantities.

<h3>Hydrating and dehydrating dynamics process as an ion entering a carbon  nanotube</h3>

<p>Ion transport within confined environments, like nanopores and nanotubes, is
pivotal for advancing a range of applications, including biosensors, seawater
desalination, and energy storage devices. Existing research does not
sufficiently delve into the alterations in ion hydration structure, a key
element that significantly influences ion transport properties in such confined
environments. Here, we report a theoretical model comprehensively considering
the interplay between ions and nanotubes. By incorporating the effect of
orientational competition, our model effectively predicts both the change in
hydration structure and the free energy profile during an ion's transition from
bulk water into a nanotube. These predictions match closely with the results
from molecular dynamics simulations.

<i>Edgar Avalos</i>
<p>In this thesis, we develop a simple model potential for polar molecules that
effectively and accurately represents the thermodynamics of dilute gases. This
potential models dipolar interactions, with a nonpolar spherical component, as
seen in Stockmayer (SM) molecules or diatomic molecules such as dipolar
Lennard-Jones molecules with two centers (2CLJ). Predictions based on this
model for the second virial coefficient for SM and 2CLJ fluids closely match
recent numerical results obtained by C. Vega et al. The model is employed to
predict the critical temperature of an SM fluid with a variable dipole moment,
as well as its equilibrium liquid-vapor properties. Finally, we apply this
model to real polar molecules. A notable feature of this work is its connection
between the shape of the potential profile and thermodynamic properties.

<i>S.V. Koniakhin, O.I. Utesov, A.G. Yashenkin</i>
<p>In the present paper, we utilize the coupled-oscillator model describing the
hybridization of optical phonons in touching and/or overlapping particles in
order to study the Raman spectra of nanoparticles organized into various types
of regular and random arrays including nanosolids, porous media, and
agglomerates with tightly bonded particles. For the nanocrystal solids, we
demonstrate that the ratio of the size variance to the coupling strength allows
us to judge the character (localized or propagating) of the optical phonon
modes which left the particles of their origin and spread throughout an array.
The relation between the shift and the broadening of the Raman peak and the
coupling strength and the disorder is established for nanocrystal solids,
agglomerates, and porous media providing us with information about the array
structure, the structure of its constituents, and the properties of optical
phonons.

<h3>Bulk-edge correspondence recovered in incompressible continuous media</h3>

<i>Yohei Onuki, Antoine Venaille, Pierre Delplace</i>
<p>Bulk-edge correspondence is a cornerstone in topological physics,
establishing a connection between the number of unidirectional edge modes and
the topological invariants that describe bulk wave singularities. In continuous
media, this correspondence can be violated, resulting in weak topological
protection of chiral edge states. Here, we propose a strategy to reestablish
strong bulk-edge correspondence in incompressible continuous media. The key
ideas involve handling the divergence-free constraint through an auxiliary
field and considering a physical mechanism that imposes a high-frequency cutoff
of bulk waves. When applied to rotating stratified fluids, this approach
highlights the resilience of coastal Kelvin waves near vertical walls under
varying boundary conditions.

<p>Interferometers and beam splitters are fundamental building blocks for
photonic neuromorphic and quantum computing machinery. In waveguide-based
photonic integrated circuits, beam-splitting is achieved with directional
couplers that rely on transition regions where the waveguides are adiabatically
bent to suppress back-reflection. We present a novel, compact approach to
introducing guided mode coupling. By leveraging multimodal domain walls between
microwave topological photonic crystals, we use the photonic-spin-conservation
to suppress back-reflection while relaxing the topological protection of the
valley degree of freedom to implement tunable beam splitting. Rapid
advancements in chip-scale topological photonics suggest that the proposed
simultaneous utilization of multiple topological degrees of freedom could
benefit the development of novel photonic computing platforms.

<h3>Anomalous Electromagnetic Induction Engendered by Singular Gauge  Transformation</h3>

<i>Wei Luo, Wei Chen, D. Y. Xing</i>
<p>The Berry curvature, resembling the magnetic field in reciprocal space,
offers a captivating avenue for exploring unique electromagnetic phenomena
devoid of real-space analogs. Here, we investigate the emergent electromagnetic
induction by solenoidal Berry curvature with its field lines forming loops,
links, and knots. In stark contrast to Faraday's law, which dictates that
alternating magnetic fields yield alternating electric fields with a net zero
average, the alternating Berry curvature can engender directional
electromagnetic induction. Such an effect is attributed to the presence of
singularities in the Berry curvature, accompanied by a $2\pi$ jump in the Berry
flux. Notably, this jump does not trigger a diamagnetic impulse, due to the
gauge invariance of the Berry phase modulo $2\pi$. Consequently, the induced
electric field maintains finite values under time averaging, manifesting itself
as a directional pumping current. Our research sheds light on an anomalous
electromagnetic induction effect directly arising from the singular gauge
transformation, thereby expanding our comprehension of exotic electromagnetic
phenomena.

<h3>3D carbon allotropes: Topological quantum materials with obstructed  atomic insulating phases, multiple bulk-boundary correspondences, and real  topology</h3>

<i>Jianhua Wang, Ting-Ting Zhang, Qianwen Zhang, Xia Cheng, Wenhong Wang, Shifeng Qian, Zhenxiang Cheng, Gang Zhang, Xiaotian Wang</i>
<p>The study of topological phases with unconventional bulk-boundary
correspondences and nontrivial real Chern number has garnered significant
attention in the topological states of matter. Using the first-principle
calculations and theoretical analysis, we perform a high-throughput material
screening of the 3D obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) and 3D real Chern
insulators (RCIs) based on the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA).
Results show that 422 out of 703 3D carbon allotropes are 3D OAIs with multiple
bulk-boundary correspondences, including 2D obstructed surface states (OSSs)
and 1D hinge states, which are in one dimension and two dimensions lower than
the 3D bulk, respectively. The 2D OSSs in these OAIs can be modified when
subjected to appropriate boundaries, which benefits the investigation of
surface engineering and the development of efficient topological catalysts.
These 422 OAIs, which have 2D and 1D boundary states, are excellent platforms
for multi-dimensional topological boundaries research. Remarkably, 138 of 422
OAIs are also 3D RCIs, which show a nontrivial real topology in the protection
of spacetime inversion symmetry. Our work not only provides a comprehensive
list of 3D carbon-based OAIs and RCIs, but also guides their application in
various aspects based on multiple bulk-boundary correspondences and real
topological phases.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) Fe-chalcogenides with rich structures, magnetisms and

FeTe were systematically investigated under extreme conditions through
comparing two distinct symmetries, i.e., tetragonal (t-) and hexagonal (h-)
FeTe. We found that 2D t-FeTe presented the pressure-induced transition from
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic states at ~ 3 GPa, corresponding to the
tetragonal collapse of layered structure. Contrarily, ferromagnetic order of 2D
h-FeTe was retained up to 15 GPa, evidently confirmed by electrical transport
and Raman measurements. Furthermore, the detailed P-T phase diagrams of both 2D
t-FeTe and h-FeTe were mapped out with the delicate critical conditions. We
believe our results can provide a unique platform to elaborate the
extraordinary physical properties of Fe-chalcogenides and further to develop
their practical applications.

<h3>Dynamical relaxation of a long-range XY chain</h3>

<i>Yu-Huang Huang, Yin-Tao Zou, Chengxiang Ding</i>
<p>We study the universal real-time relaxation behaviors of a long-range quantum
XY chain following a quench. Our research includes both the noncritical and
critical quench. In the case of noncritical quench, i.e., neither the initial
state nor the postquench Hamiltonian is at a critical point of equilibrium
phase transition, a quench to the commensurate phase or incommensurate phase
gives a scaling of $t^{-3/2}$ or $t^{-1/2}$, respectively, which is the same as
the counterpart of the short-range XY model. However, for a quench to the
boundary line between the commensurate and incommensurate phases, the scaling
law $t^{-\mu}$ may be different from the $t^{-3/4}$ law of the counterpart of
the short-range model. More interestingly, the decaying exponent $\mu$ may
depend on the choice of the parameters of the postquench Hamiltonian because of
the different asymptotic behaviors of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, in
certain cases, the scaling behavior may be outside the range of predictions
made by the stationary phase approximation, because an inflection point emerges
in the energy spectrum. For the critical quench, i.e., the initial state or the
postquench Hamiltonian is at a critical point of equilibrium phase transition,
the aforementioned scaling law $t^{-\mu}$ may be changed because of the
gap-closing property of the energy spectrum of the critical point.

<br>
<i>Chih-Piao Chuu, Wei-En Tseng, Kuan-Hung Liu, Ching-Ming Wei, Mei-Yin Chou</i>
<p>Finding an effective and controllable way to create a sizable energy gap in
graphene-based systems has been a challenging topic of intensive research. We
propose that the hybrid of boron nitride and graphene (h-BNC) at low BN doping
serves as an ideal platform for band-gap engineering and valleytronic
applications. We report a systematic first-principles study of the atomic
configurations and band gap opening for energetically favorable BN patches
embedded in graphene. Based on first-principles calculations, we construct a
tight-binding model to simulate general doping configurations in large
supercells. Unexpectedly, the calculations find a linear dependence of the band
gap on the effective BN concentration at low doping, arising from an induced
effective on-site energy difference at the two C sublattices as they are
substituted by B and N dopants alternately. The significant and tunable band
gap of a few hundred meVs, with preserved topological properties of graphene
and feasible sample preparation in the laboratory, presents great opportunities
to realize valley physics applications in graphene systems at room temperature.

<h3>Non-Hermitian second-order topological superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Xaing Ji, Wenchen Ding, Yuanping Chen, Xiaosen Yang</i>
<p>The topology of non-Hermitian systems is fundamentally changed by the
non-Hermitian skin effect, which leads to the generalized bulk-boundary
correspondence. Based on the non-Bloch band theory, we get insight into the
interplay between the non-Hermiticity and the second-order topological
superconductors in two spatial dimensions. We find that the non-Hermiticity
drives both the bulk states and topological edge states to accumulate toward
opposite corners of the system depending on the particle and hole degrees of
freedom protected by the particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore, the degeneracy of
the Majorana corner modes can be broken in terms of both the eigenenergies and
the localized corners. Through an edge theory analysis, we elucidate the impact
of non-Hermiticity and enable the extension of higher-order topological
superconductors to the realm of non-Hermitian systems. The reported $Z_2$ skin
effect and $Z_2$ skin-topological modes reveal the universal characteristics of
non-Hermitian second-order topological superconductors and the generalized
bulk-boundary correspondence is further enriched by the particle-hole symmetry.

<h3>Vanishing of the anomalous Hall effect and enhanced carrier mobility in  the spin-gapless ferromagnetic Mn2CoGa1-xAlx alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18335" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18335</a>
<br>
<i>Cheng Zhang, Shuang Pan, Peihao Wang, Yuchen Men, Xiang Li, Yuqing Bai, Li Tang, Feng Xu, Guizhou Xu</i>
<p>Spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) has attracted long attention since its
theoretical prediction, while concrete experimental hints are still lack in the
relevant Heusler alloys. Here in this work, by preparing the series alloys of
Mn2CoGa1-xAlx (x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1), we identified the vanishing of
anomalous Hall effect in the ferromagnetic Mn2CoGa (or x=0.25) alloy in a wide
temperature interval, accompanying with growing contribution from the ordinary
Hall effect. As a result, comparatively low carrier density (1020 cm-3) and
high carrier mobility (150 cm2/Vs) are obtained in Mn2CoGa (or x=0.25) alloy in
the temperature range of 10-200K. These also lead to a large dip in the related
magnetoresistance at low fields. While in high Al content, despite the
magnetization behavior is not altered significantly, the Hall resistivity is
instead dominated by the anomalous one, just analogous to that widely reported
in Mn2CoAl. The distinct electrical transport behavior of x=0 and x=0.75 (or 1)
is presently understood by their possible different scattering mechanism of the
anomalous Hall effect due to the differences in atomic order and conductivity.
Our work can expand the existing understanding of the SGS properties and offer
a better SGS candidate with higher carrier mobility that can facilitate the
application in the spin-injected related devices.

<h3>Highly sensitive magnetic properties and large linear magnetoresistance  in antiferromagnetic CrxSe(0.875\lex\le1)single crystals</h3>

<i>Yuqing Bai, Shuang Pan, Ziqian Lu, Yuanyuan Gong, Guizhou Xu, Feng Xu</i>
<p>CrxSe (x\le1) is a class of quasi-layered binary compounds with potential
applications in spintronics due to its intriguing antiferromagnetic properties.
In this work, CrxSe single crystals with high Cr content (x=0.87, 0.91 and
0.95) were grown, and their magnetic and transport properties were investigated
in detail. It is found that with small increase of Cr content, the N\'eel
temperature (TN) of the samples can dramatically increase from 147 K to 257 K,
accompanied with obvious changes in the magnetic anisotropy and hysteresis. The
phenomena of field-induced spin-flop transitions were unveiled in these alloys,
indicating their comparatively low anisotropy. The magnetoresistance (MR) of
the three compounds showed positive dependence at low temperatures and
particularly, non-saturated linear positive MR was observed in Cr0.91Se and
Cr0.95Se, with a large value of 16.2% achieved in Cr0.91Se (10K, 9T). The
calculated Fermi surface and MR showed that the quasi-linear MR is a product of
carrier compensation. Our work revealed highly sensitive magnetic and transport
properties in the Cr-Se compounds, which can lay foundation when constructing
further antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on them.

<h3>Criteria to observe single-shot all-optical switching in Gd-based  ferrimagnetic alloys</h3>

<p>Single-shot all-optical helicity-independent switching (AO-HIS) induced by a
femto-second laser pulse has been mainly reported in Gadolinium based rare
earth-transition metal (RE-TM) alloys such as GdFeCo or GdCo, but the mechanism
leading to magnetization switching is a hotly debated topic. Here, we elaborate
on a large number of GdyRE1-x-yCox (RE = Dy, Tb, Ho) alloys to tune various
magnetic parameters in order to define what the criteria are for observing
AO-HIS in such systems. The state diagrams show that two laser fluences
thresholds must be considered:the fluence which induces the single laser pulse
switching (FSwitch) and the fluence at which the material breaks into a
multi-domain state (FMulti). Those two fluences are shown to behave very
differently as a function of the material properties and the laser pulse
duration. Taking into account the parameters defining the conditions for which
multi-domain states are created and considering only the angular momentum
transfer from the Gd sublattice to the rest of the system explains in large our
experimental results. The importance of the compensation in the ferrimagnetic
alloys is also discussed. We believe the defined criteria will be an important
tool for designing new ultra-fast spintronic devices based on all optical
switching.

<h3>Growth of high-quality CrI3 single crystals and engineering of its  magnetic properties via V and Mn doping</h3>

<br>
<i>Shuang Pan, Yuqing Bai, Jiaxuan Tang, Peihao Wang, Yurong You, Guizhou Xu, Feng Xu</i>
<p>CrI3, as a soft van der Waals layered magnetic material, has been widely
concerned and explored for its magnetic complexity and tunability. In this
work, high quality and large size thin CrI3, V and Mn doped single crystals
were prepared by chemical vapor transfer method. A remarkable irreversible
Barkhausen effect was observed in CrI3 and CrMn0.06I3, which can be attributed
to the low dislocation density that facilitates movement of the domain walls.
In addition, the introduction of the doping element Mn allows higher saturation
magnetization intensity. Cr0.5V0.5I3 exhibits substantially increased
coercivity force and larger magnetocrystalline anisotropy compared to CrI3,
while kept similar Curie temperature and good environmental stability. The
first principles calculations suggest direct and narrowed band gaps in
Cr0.5V0.5I3 and VI3 comparing to CrI3. The smaller band gaps and good hard
magnetic property make Cr0.5V0.5I3 an alternative choice to future research of
spintronic devices.

<h3>Curvature directed anchoring and defect structure of colloidal smectic  liquid crystals in confinement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18362" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18362</a>
<br>
<i>Ethan I. L. Jull, Gerardo Campos-Villalobos, Qianjing Tang, Marjolein Dijkstra, Lisa Tran</i>
<p>Rod-like objects at high packing fractions can form smectic phases, where the
rods break rotational and translational symmetry by forming lamellae. Smectic
defects thereby include both discontinuities in the rod orientational order
(disclinations), as well as in the positional order (dislocations). In this
work, we use both experiments and simulations to probe how local and global
geometrical frustrations affect defect formation in hard-rod smectics. We
confine a particle-resolved, colloidal smectic within elliptical wells of
varying size and shape for a smooth variation of the boundary curvature. We
find that the rod orientation near a boundary - the anchoring - depends upon
the boundary curvature, with an anchoring transition observed at a critical
radius of curvature approximately twice the rod length. The anchoring controls
the smectic defect structure. By analyzing local and global order parameters,
and the topological charges and loops of networks made of the density maxima
(rod centers) and density minima (rod ends), we quantify the amount of
disclinations and dislocations formed with varying confinement geometry. More
circular confinements, having only planar anchoring, promote disclinations,
while more elliptical confinements, with antipodal regions of homeotropic
anchoring, promote long-range smectic ordering and dislocation formation. Our
findings demonstrate how geometrical constraints can control the anchoring and
defect structures of liquid crystals - a principle that is applicable from
molecular to colloidal length scales.

<h3>Anomalous scalings of fluctuations of the area swept by a Brownian  particle trapped in a $|x|$ potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18366" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18366</a>
<br>
<i>Naftali R. Smith</i>
<p>We study the fluctuations of the area $A=\int_0^T x(t) dt$ under a
one-dimensional Brownian motion $x(t)$ in a trapping potential $\sim |x|$, at
long times $T\to\infty$. We find that typical fluctuations of $A$ follow a
Gaussian distribution with a variance that grows linearly in time (at large
$T$), as do all higher cumulants of the distribution. However, large deviations
of $A$ are not described by the ``usual'' scaling (i.e., the large deviations
principle), and are instead described by two different anomalous scaling
behaviors: Moderatly-large deviations of $A$, obey the anomalous scaling
$P\left(A;T\right)\sim e^{-T^{1/3}f\left(A/T^{2/3}\right)}$ while very large
deviations behave as $P\left(A;T\right)\sim e^{-T\Psi\left(A/T^{2}\right)}$. We
find the associated rate functions $f$ and $\Psi$ exactly. Each of the two
functions contains a singularity, which we interpret as dynamical phase
transitions of the first and third order, respectively. We uncover the origin
of these striking behaviors by characterizing the most likely scenario(s) for
the system to reach a given atypical value of $A$. We extend our analysis by
studying the absolute area $B=\int_0^T|x(t)| dt$ and also by generalizing to
higher spatial dimension, focusing on the particular case of three dimensions.

<h3>General features and contact modeling of $N$-body isolated resonances  near threshold</h3>

<br>
<i>Ludovic Pricoupenko</i>
<p>$N$-body non efimovian bound or quasi-bound states for particles with short
range interactions are considered in arbitrary dimensions. The different
resonance regimes near the threshold are depicted by using a generalization of
the effective range approximation. This two-parameter description can be used
in various contexts from ultra-cold to hadronic physics. The universal
character of these states makes it possible a formulation in terms of a contact
model. The singularity at the contact imposes the introduction of a modified
scalar product to solve the normalization catastrophe and to restore the
self-adjoint character of the model. An equivalence with the standard scalar
product used for realistic finite range models is derived.

<h3>Optimal finite-differences discretization for the diffusion equation  from the perspective of large-deviation theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18374</a>
<br>
<i>Naftali R. Smith</i>
<p>When applying the finite-differences method to numerically solve the
one-dimensional diffusion equation, one must choose discretization steps
$\Delta x$, $\Delta t$ in space and time, respectively. By applying
large-deviation theory on the discretized dynamics, we analyze the numerical
errors due to the discretization, and find that the (relative) errors are
especially large in regions of space where the concentration of particles is
very small. We find that the choice $\Delta t = {\Delta x}^2 / (6D)$, where $D$
is the diffusion coefficient, gives optimal accuracy compared to any other
choice (including, in particular, the limit $\Delta t \to 0$), thus reproducing
the known result that may be obtained using truncation error analysis. In
addition, we give quantitative estimates for the dynamical lengthscale at which
the numerical solution is accurate, and study its dependence on the
discretization parameters. We then turn to study the the advection-diffusion
equation, and obtain explicit expressions for the optimal $\Delta t$ and other
parameters of the finite-differences scheme, in terms of $\Delta x$, $D$ and
the advection velocity. We apply these results to study large deviations of the
area swept by a diffusing particle in one dimension, trapped by an external
potential $\sim |x|$. We extend our analysis to higher dimensions by combining
our results from the one dimensional case with the locally one-dimension
method.

<h3>Freezing-out of heavy isotopes of Kr</h3>

<br>
<i>A. R. Cholach, D. V. Yakovin, N. I. Latkin, I. A. Sidorov</i>
<p>The separation of isotopes of natural Krypton at the gas-liquid and
liquid-solid phase interfaces was studied under nonequilibrium conditions using
a cryogenic cell and mass spectrometry. The formation of condensate upon
cooling Kr from the ambient temperature begins at an equilibrium temperature,
which corresponds to the partial pressure of the dominant isotope 84Kr, and is
accompanied by depletion of the gas phase 84Kr with a separation coefficient of
~0.92; but the isotopic composition returns to the original under conditions
close to equilibrium. The formation of a solid phase near the freezing point is
accompanied by depletion of the gas phase by heavy isotopes. The separation
coefficients 86Kr and 84Kr are ~2 and ~12, respectively, when ~3.2% of the
atoms pass into the solid phase. The solid phase with its fraction below 8.8%,
5.8% and 5.7% does not contain 80Kr, 82Kr and 83Kr with separation coefficients
above ~90, ~110 and ~70, respectively, to compensate for the enrichment of the
gas and liquid phases. Pressure-selective condensation can be used to separate
components with close boiling points when distillation and
temperature-selective condensation methods are ineffective, and freezing-out of
heavy isotopes can be used to enrich elements with practically important
isotopes.

<h3>Curvature-driven pathways interpolating between stationary points: the  case of the pure spherical 3-spin model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18411" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18411</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Pacco, Giulio Biroli, Valentina Ros</i>
<p>This paper focuses on characterizing the energy profile along pathways
connecting different regions of configuration space in the context of a
prototypical glass model, the pure spherical $p$-spin model with $p=3$. The
study investigates pairs of stationary points (local minima or rank-1 saddles),
analyzing the energy profile along geodesic paths and comparing them with
"perturbed" pathways correlated to the landscape curvature. The goal is to
assess the extent to which information from the local Hessian matrices around
stationary points can identify paths with lower energy barriers. Surprisingly,
unlike findings in other systems, the direction of softest local curvature is
not a reliable predictor of low-energy paths, except in the case in which the
direction of softest curvature corresponds to an isolated mode of the Hessian.
However, other information encoded in the local Hessian does allow the
identification of pathways associated with lower energy barriers. We conclude
commenting on implications for the system's activated dynamics.

<h3>Induced quantum magnetism in CEF singlet ground state models:  Thermodynamics and excitations</h3>

<br>
<i>Peter Thalmeier, Alireza Akbari</i>
<p>We present a comparative investigation of singlet ground state induced
magnetism for singlet, doublet and triplet excited CEF states of non-Kramers
f-electrons relevant primarily for Pr- and U- based compounds. This type of
magnetic order is of intrinsic quantum nature because it requires the
superposition of singlet ground state with excited states due to non-diagonal
matrix elements of the effective intersite exchange to generate local moments.
In contrast to conventional magnets the local moments and their ordering appear
simultaneously at the transition temperature. It is finite only if the control
parameter proportional to the ratio of exchange strength to level splitting
exceeds a critical value marking the quantum critical point of the models. We
determine the dependence of transition temperature, saturation moment,
renormalised level splitting, specific heat jumps and low-temperature
susceptibility as function of control parameter. Furthermore the temperature
dependence of these quantities is calculated for control parameters above and
below the quantum critical point and the distinction to conventional magnetism
is discussed. In addition we investigate the dynamical properties of the three
models, deriving the magnetic exciton dispersion and their critical behaviour.
In particular the conditions for true and arrested soft-mode behaviour at the
ordering wave vector are identified.

<h3>Electronic Phase Propagation Speed in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ Revealed by  Dilatometry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18442" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18442</a>
<br>
<i>Xin Qin, Xingyu Wang, Wenshan Hong, Yuan Li, Huiqian Luo, Shiliang Li, Yang Liu</i>
<p>Thermal expansion carries crucial information about phase transitions. In
this study, we employ an interferometer-based dilatometer to investigate the
phase transition in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ with picometer-resolution. Thanks to the
ultra-high resolution and the differential nature of our measurement, we
discover a hysteresis behavior near the antiferromagnetic transition
temperature $T_\mathrm{N}$ whose pattern reveals a propagation speed of the
phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases.
Remarkably, this speed is only about 188 $\mu$m/s, seven orders of magnitude
lower than that of acoustic waves. This discrepancy, despite the magnetoelastic
nature of the transition at $T_\mathrm{N}$, reveals a hidden constraint related
to the electronic degrees of freedom. Our findings highlight the potential of
high-resolution dilatometry as a powerful probe of electron-correlation effects
in quantum materials.

<br>
<i>Alexander Gorsky, Sergei Nechaev, Alexander Valov</i>
<p>We discuss the generalization of a classical problem involving an $N$-step
ideal polymer adsorption at a sticky boundary (potential well of depth $U$). It
is known that as $N$ approaches infinity, the path undergoes a 2nd-order
localization transition at a certain value of $U_{\text{tr}}$. By considering
the random walk on a half-line with a sticky boundary (Model I), we demonstrate
that the order of the phase transition can be altered by adjusting the scaling
of the first return probability to the boundary. Additionally, we present a
model of a random path on a discrete 1D lattice with non-uniform local hopping
amplitudes and a potential well at the boundary (Model II). We illustrate that
one can tailor such amplitudes so that the polymer undergoes a 3rd-order phase
transition.

<i>Xu Ge, Roman Verba, Philipp Pirro, Andrii V. Chumak, Qi Wang</i>
<p>Magnonics is a rapidly growing field, attracting much attention for its
potential applications in data transport and processing. Many individual
magnonic devices have been proposed and realized in laboratories. However, an
integrated magnonic circuit with several separate magnonic elements has yet not
been reported due to the lack of a magnonic amplifier to compensate for
transport and processing losses. The magnon transistor reported in [Nat.
Commun. 5, 4700, (2014)] could only achieve a gain of 1.8, which is
insufficient in many practical cases. Here, we use the stimulated three-magnon
splitting phenomenon to numerically propose a concept of magnon transistor in
which the energy of the gate magnons at 14.6 GHz is directly pumped into the
energy of the source magnons at 4.2 GHz, thus achieving the gain of 9. The
structure is based on the 100 nm wide YIG nano-waveguides, a directional
coupler is used to mix the source and gate magnons, and a dual-band magnonic
crystal is used to filter out the gate and idler magnons at 10.4 GHz frequency.
The magnon transistor preserves the phase of the signal and the design allows
integration into a magnon circuit.

<h3>Ce$_{2}$Ir$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$ : a new locally non-centrosymmetric heavy  fermion system</h3>

<i>Arushi, Raul Cardoso-Gil, Christoph Geibel</i>
<p>Recently, a new type of unconventional superconductivity with a field-induced
transition between two different superconducting (SC) states was discovered in
the heavy fermion system CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$. This unusual SC state was proposed
to be based on specific symmetries of the underlying structure, i.e., a
globally centrosymmetric layered structure, but where the Ce-layers themselves
lack inversion symmetry. This new type of SC state has attracted strong
interest, prompting the search for further heavy fermion systems crystallizing
in structures with appropriate symmetries. We report the discovery and the
study of a new Ce-based heavy fermion system with a globally centrosymmetric
structure but without inversion symmetry on the Ce-site,
Ce$_{2}$Ir$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$. A single crystal X-ray diffraction study revealed an
orthorhombic U$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Si$_{5}$ type structure. Resistivity, specific
heat, and magnetization measurements indicate a moderate-heavy fermion behavior
with a Kondo energy scale of the order of 40 K. Most experimental results
suggest the absence of magnetic order, but a tiny anomaly in the specific heat
opens the possibility for a very weak, itinerant type of ordering.

<p>We investigate the detection of quartets in hybrid multiterminal Josephson
junctions. Using simple models of quantum dots coupled to superconducting
leads, we find that quartets are ubiquitous and show how to rigorously extract
their contribution to the current-phase relation (CPR). We also demonstrate
that quartets are closely related to the hybridization of Andreev bound states
(ABSs) in these systems and propose a method to identify quartets directly in
ABS spectra. We illustrate our method by analyzing the spectroscopic
measurements of the ABS spectrum in a three-terminal Josephson junction
realized in an InAs/Al heterostructure. Our analysis strongly suggests the
existence of quartets in the studied hybrid system.

<p>It is known that the chiral interaction described by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

such as helical or skyrmion phases. Here we present the that analogues
electrical DMI can lead to similar structural complexity of electric dipoles in

spontaneously form a heliconical structure. The helical pitch is comparable to
the wavelength of visible light and unwinds critically at the transition to a
uniformly polar, ferroelectric nematic phase. Although this new liquid
crystalline phase resembles the twist-bend nematic phase, the mechanism of its
formation is different and is attributed to electrical interactions that cause
non-collinear arrangement of electric dipoles, similarly as observed for spins
in magnetic systems.

<i>Michael Horn von Hoegen</i>
<p>Many fundamental processes of structural changes at surfaces occur on a pico-
or femtosecond time scale. In order to study such ultra-fast processes, we have
combined modern surface science techniques with fs-laser pulses in a pump-probe
scheme. Reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) with grazing
incident electrons ensures surface sensitivity for the probing electron pulses.
Utilizing the Debye-Waller effect, we studied the nanoscale heat transport from
an ultrathin film through a hetero-interface or the damping of vibrational
excitations in monolayer adsorbate systems on the lower ps-time scale. By means
of spot profile analysis the different cooling rates of epitaxial Ge
nanostructures of different size and strain state were determined. The
excitation and relaxation dynamics of a driven phase transition far away from
thermal equilibrium is demonstrated using the In-induced (8x2) reconstruction
on Si(111). This Peierls-distorted surface charge density wave system exhibits
a discontinuous phase transition at 130 K from a (8x2) insulating ground state
to (4x1) metallic excited state. Upon excitation by a fs-laser pulse, this
structural phase transition is non-thermally driven in only 700 fs into the
excited state. A small barrier of 40 meV hinders the immediate recovery of the
groundstate and the system is found in a metastable supercooled state for up to
few nanoseconds.

<br>

<p>We demonstrate that a spin current flowing through a nano-contact into a
uniaxial antiferromagnet with first- and second-order anisotropy can excite a
self-localized dynamic magnetic soliton, known as a spin-wave droplet in
ferromagnets. The droplet nucleates at a certain threshold current with the
frequency of the N\'eel vector precession laying below the antiferromagnetic
resonance. The frequency exhibits nonlinear behavior with the increasing of
applied current. At the high value of applied torque, the soliton mode
transforms, and the oscillator emits spin waves propagating in the
antiferromagnetic layer.

<h3>Accurate Dielectric Response of Solids: Combining the Bethe-Salpeter  Equation with the Random Phase Approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18623</a>
<br>
<i>Amalie H. Søndersted, Mikael Kuisma, Jakob K. Svaneborg, Mark Kamper Svendsen, Kristian S. Thygesen</i>
<p>The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) can provide an accurate description of
low-energy optical spectra of insulating crystals - even when excitonic effects
are important. However, due to high computational costs it is only possible to
include a few bands in the BSE Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the dielectric
screening given by the real part of the dielectric function can be
significantly underestimated by the BSE. Here we show that universally accurate
optical response functions can be obtained by combining a four-point BSE-like
equation for the irreducible polarisability with a two-point Dyson equation
which includes the higher-lying transitions within the random phase
approximation (RPA). The new method is referred to as BSE+. It has a
computational cost comparable to the BSE but a much faster convergence with
respect to the size of the electron-hole basis. We use the method to calculate
refractive indices and electron energy loss spectra for a test set of
semiconductors and insulators. In all cases the BSE+ yields excellent agreement
with experimental data across a wide frequency range and outperforms both BSE
and RPA.

<h3>Detecting nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen centers on the nanoscale using  nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18624" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18624</a>
<br>
<i>Christoph Findler, Rémi Blinder, Karolina Schüle, Priyadharshini Balasubramanian, Christian Osterkamp, Fedor Jelezko</i>
<p>In diamond, nitrogen defects like the substitutional nitrogen defect (Ns) or
the nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen complex (NVH) outnumber the nitrogen vacancy (NV)
defect by at least one order of magnitude creating a dense spin bath. While
neutral Ns has an impact on the coherence of the NV spin state, the atomic
structure of NVH reminds of a NV center decorated with a hydrogen atom. As a
consequence, the formation of NVH centers could compete with that of NV centers
possibly lowering the N-to-NV conversion efficiency in diamond grown with
hydrogen-plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Therefore, monitoring
and controlling the spin bath is essential to produce and understand engineered
diamond material with high NV concentrations for quantum applications. While
the incorporation of Ns in diamond has been investigated on the nano- and
mesoscale for years, studies concerning the influence of CVD parameters and the
crystal orientation on the NVH formation have been restricted to bulk N-doped
diamond providing high-enough spin numbers for electron paramagnetic resonance
and optical absorption spectroscopy techniques. Here, we investigate
sub-micron-thick (100)-diamond layers with nitrogen contents of (13.8 +- 1.6)
ppm and (16.7 +- 3.6) ppm, and exploiting the NV centers in the layers as local
nano-sensors, we demonstrate the detection of NVH- centers using
double-electron-electron-resonance (DEER). To determine the NVH- densities, we
quantitatively fit the hyperfine structure of NVH- and confirm the results with
the DEER method usually used for determining Ns0 densities. With our
experiments, we access the spin bath composition on the nanoscale and enable a
fast feedback-loop in CVD recipe optimization with thin diamond layers instead
of resource- and time-intensive bulk crystals.

<h3>Thermodynamics of a minimal collective heat engine: Comparison between  engine designs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18629" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18629</a>
<br>
<i>Felipe Hawthorne, B. Cleuren, Carlos E. Fiore</i>
<p>Collective effects have attracted remarkable recent interest, not only for
their presence in several systems in nature but also for the possibility of
being used for the construction of efficient engine setups. Notwithstanding,
little is known about the influence of the engine design and most studies are
restricted to the simplest cases (e.g. simultaneous contact with two thermal
baths), not necessarily constituting a realistic setup implementation. Aimed at
partially filling this gap, we introduce the collisional/sequential description
for a minimal model for collective effects, composed of two interacting
nanomachines placed in contact with a distinct thermal reservoir and
nonequilibrium worksource at each stage/stroke. Thermodynamic quantities are
exactly obtained irrespectively the model details. Distinct kinds of engines
are investigated and the influence of the interaction, temperature, period, and
time asymmetry have been investigated. Results show that a careful design of
interaction provides a superior performance than the interactionless case,
including optimal power outputs and efficiencies at maximum power greater than
known bounds or even efficiencies approaching the ideal (Carnot) limit. We also
show that the case of the system simultaneously placed in contact with two
thermal reservoirs constitutes a particular case of our framework.

<h3>Nanoscale confinement and control of excitonic complexes in a monolayer  WSe2</h3>

<br>
<i>Hyowon Moon, Lukas Mennel, Chitraleema Chakraborty, Cheng Peng, Jawaher Almutlaq, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Dirk Englund</i>
<p>Nanoscale control and observation of photophysical processes in
semiconductors is critical for basic understanding and applications from
optoelectronics to quantum information processing. In particular, there are
open questions and opportunities in controlling excitonic complexes in
two-dimensional materials such as excitons, trions or biexcitons. However,
neither conventional diffraction-limited optical spectroscopy nor
lithography-limited electric control provides a proper tool to investigate
these quasiparticles at the nanometer-scale at cryogenic temperature. Here, we
introduce a cryogenic capacitive confocal optical microscope (C3OM) as a tool
to study quasiparticle dynamics at the nanometer scale. Using a conductive
atomic force microscope (AFM) tip as a gate electrode, we can modulate the
electronic doping at the nanometer scale in WSe2 at 4K. This tool allows us to
modulate with nanometer-scale confinement the exciton and trion peaks, as well
a distinct photoluminescence line associated with a larger excitonic complex
that exhibits distinctive nonlinear optical response. Our results demonstrate
nanoscale confinement and spectroscopy of exciton complexes at arbitrary
positions, which should prove an important tool for quantitative understanding
of complex optoelectronic properties in semiconductors as well as for
applications ranging from quantum spin liquids to superresolution measurements
to control of quantum emitters.

<h3>Topological nodal line semimetals with chiral symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>Faruk Abdulla, Ganpathy Murthy, Ankur Das</i>
<p>Topological semimetals in three dimensions display band-touchings at points
(Weyl or Dirac semimetals) or nodal lines in the Brillouin zone. Weyl
semimetals can occur with internal symmetries only (time-reversal ${\cal T}$,
charge conjugation ${\cal C}$, and a product of the two, called
chiral/sublattice symmetry ${\cal S}={\cal T}{\cal C}$). Nodal line semimetals
possessing solely internal symmetries have only been classified abstractly,
while those with SU(2) spin rotation or crystalline symmetries are known more
explicitly. We show that chiral symmetry classes that are topologically
nontrivial in three dimensions (namely class AIII, CII, CI, and DIII) always
have a stable gapless phase, which is a topological nodal line semimetal. Our
classification differs from previous approaches and has direct implications for
gapless surface states.

<h3>Highly efficient and transferable interatomic potentials for  α-iron and α-iron/hydrogen binary systems using deep neural  networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18686</a>
<br>
<i>Shihao Zhang, Fanshun Meng, Rong Fu, Shigenobu Ogata</i>
<p>Artificial neural network potentials (NNPs) have emerged as effective tools
for understanding atomic interactions at the atomic scale in various phenomena.
Recently, we developed highly transferable NNPs for {\alpha}-iron and
{\alpha}-iron/hydrogen binary systems (Physical Review Materials 5 (11),
113606, 2021). These potentials allowed us to investigate deformation and
fracture in {\alpha}-iron under the influence of hydrogen. However, the
computational cost of the NNP remains relatively high compared to empirical
potentials, limiting their applicability in addressing practical issues related
to hydrogen embrittlement. In this work, building upon our prior research on
iron-hydrogen NNP, we developed a new NNP that not only maintains the excellent
transferability but also significantly improves computational efficiency (more
than 40 times faster). We applied this new NNP to study the impact of hydrogen
on the cracking of iron and the deformation of polycrystalline iron. We
employed large-scale through-thickness {110}<110> crack models and large-scale
polycrystalline {\alpha}-iron models. The results clearly show that hydrogen
atoms segregated at crack tips promote brittle-cleavage failure followed by
crack growth. Additionally, hydrogen atoms at grain boundaries facilitate the
nucleation of intergranular nanovoids and subsequent intergranular fracture. We
anticipate that this high-efficiency NNP will serve as a valuable tool for
gaining atomic-scale insights into hydrogen embrittlement.

<i>Mathias Krämer, Bar Favelukis, Maxim Sokol, Brian A. Rosen, Noam Eliaz, Se-Ho Kim, Baptiste Gault</i>
<p>2D materials are emerging as promising nanomaterials for applications in
energy storage and catalysis. In the wet chemical synthesis of MXenes, these 2D
transition metal carbides and nitrides are terminated with a variety of
functional groups, and cations such as Li+ are often used to intercalate into
the structure to obtain exfoliated nanosheets. Given the various elements
involved in their synthesis, it is crucial to determine the detailed chemical
composition of the final product, in order to better assess and understand the
relationships between composition and properties of these materials. To
facilitate atom probe tomography analysis of these materials, a revised
specimen preparation method is presented in this study. A colloidal Ti3C2Tz
MXene solution was processed into an additive-free free-standing film and
specimens were prepared using a dual beam scanning electron microscope /
focused ion beam. To mechanically stabilize the fragile specimens, they were
coated using an in situ sputtering technique. As various 2D material inks can
be processed into such free-standing films, the presented approach is pivotal
for enabling atom probe analysis of other 2D materials.

<h3>Universality of closed nested paths in two-dimensional percolation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18700" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18700</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Feng Song, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Bernard Nienhuis, Andrea Sportiello, Youjin Deng</i>
<p>Recent work on two-dimensional percolation [arXiv:2102.07135] introduced an
operator that counts the number of nested paths (NP), which is the maximal
number of disjoint concentric cycles sustained by a cluster that percolates
from the center to the boundary of a disc of diameter $L$. Giving a weight $k$
to each nested path, with $k$ a real number, the one-point function of the NP
operator was found to scale as $ L^{-X_{\rm NP}(k)}$, with a continuously
varying exponent $X_{\rm NP}(k)$, for which an analytical formula was
conjectured on the basis of numerical result. Here we revisit the NP problem.
We note that while the original NPs are monochromatic, i.e. all on the same
cluster, one can also consider polychromatic nested paths, which can be on
different clusters, and lead to an operator with a different exponent. The
original nested paths are therefore labeled with MNP. We first derive an exact
result for $X_{\rm MNP}(k)$, valid for $k \ge -1$, which replaces the previous
conjecture. Then we study the probability distribution $\mathbb{P}_{\ell}$ that
$\ell \geq 0$ NPs exist on the percolating cluster. We show that
$\mathbb{P}_{\ell}(L)$ scales as $ L^{-1/4} (\ln L)^\ell [(1/\ell!)
\Lambda^\ell]$ when $L \gg 1$, with $\Lambda = 1/\sqrt{3} \pi$, and that the
mean number of NPs, conditioned on the existence of a percolating cluster,
diverges logarithmically as $\kappa \ln L$, with $\kappa =3/8\pi$. These
theoretical predictions are confirmed by extensive simulations for a number of
critical percolation models, hence supporting the universality of the NP
observables.

<h3>Electrical resistance associated with the scattering of optically  oriented electrons in n-GaAs</h3>

<p>In a bulk GaAs crystal, an unusual magnetoresistance effect, which takes
place when a spin-polarized current flows through the sample, was detected.
Under conditions of optical pumping of electron spins, an external magnetic
field directed along the electric current and perpendicular to the oriented
spins decreases the resistance of the material. The phenomenon is due to the
spin-dependent scattering of electrons by neutral donors. It was found that the
sign of the magnetoresistance does not depend on the sign of the exciting light
circular polarization, the effect is even with respect to the sign of the spin
polarization of the carriers, which indicates a correlation between the spins
of optically oriented free electrons and electrons localized on donors.

<h3>Controlled Skyrmion Ratchet in Linear Protrusion Defects</h3>

<br>
<i>J. C. Bellizotti Souza, N. P. Vizarim, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, P. A. Venegas</i>
<p>Using atomistic simulations, we investigate the dynamical behavior of a
single skyrmion interacting with an asymmetric linear protrusion array under
external ac driving. When the ac drive is applied along the $x$ direction, the
skyrmion moves along the hard direction of the substrate asymmetry in three
phases: a pinned phase with localized skyrmion orbits, a constant velocity
phase where the orbits become delocalized, and a reentrant pinned phase with
larger localized orbits. We measure the dependence of the skyrmion velocity on
the frequency and amplitude of the ac drive. All three phases appear for all
frequency values, and in the constant velocity phase the skyrmion velocity
depends only on the frequency and not on the amplitude of the ac drive. When ac
driving is applied in the $y$ direction, the skyrmion moves along the easy
direction of the substrate asymmetry and exhibits the same three phases as for
$x$ direction driving along with a fourth phase which, at high driving
frequencies, consists of a series of constant velocity phases, each with
different average skyrmion velocities. For low frequencies, the constant
velocity phase is lost and the skyrmion speed increases linearly with
increasing ac drive amplitude due to a Magnus boost effect. Our findings
suggest new ways to create reliable data transport for spintronic devices using
skyrmions as information carriers, where the skyrmion direction and speed can
be controlled by varying only the ac drive amplitude and frequency.

<i>Rosalind Huang, Rituparno Mandal, Colin Scheibner, Vincenzo Vitelli</i>
<p>Odd elasticity describes the unusual elastic response of solids whose
stress-strain relationship is not compatible with an elastic potential. Here,
we present a study of odd elasticity in a driven granular matter system
composed of grains with ratchet-like interparticle friction and activated by
oscillatory shear. We find that the system permits a time-averaged elasticity
theory featuring nonzero odd elastic coefficients. These coefficients are
explicitly measured using molecular dynamics simulations and can be predicted
and tuned from microscopics. In the presence of disorder, our driven granular
material displays distinctive properties ranging from self-healing grain
boundaries in polycrystalline systems to chiral plastic vortices and force
chain deflection in amorphous packings. Beyond granular matter, our work
motivates the search for microscopic transduction mechanisms that convert
periodic nonuniform drive into uniform elastic properties of active solids.

<br>
<i>F Adersh, M Muhsin, M Sahoo</i>
<p>We study the motion of an inertial microswimmer in a non-Newtonian
environment with a finite memory and present the theoretical realization of an
unexpected transition from its random self-propulsion to rotational (circular
or elliptical) motion. Further, the rotational motion of the swimmer is
followed by spontaneous local direction reversals yet with a steady state
angular diffusion. Moreover, the advent of this behaviour is observed in the
oscillatory regime of the inertia-memory parameter space of the dynamics. We
quantify this unconventional rotational motion of microswimmer by measuring the
time evolution of direction of its instantaneous velocity or orientation. By
solving the generalized Langevin model of non-Markovian dynamics of an inertial
active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle, we show that the emergence of the
rotational (circular or elliptical) trajectory is due to the presence of
inertial memory in the environment or medium.

(https://hofstadter.tools), a Python package that can be used to analyze the
energy spectrum of a generalized Hofstadter model, with any combination of

<p>The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of
tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the
virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically
focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting
two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can
affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix
and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which
can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this
effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge
transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time
evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform
a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice.
Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the
antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function
of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local
gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the
boundary MPS calculation.

<br>
<i>Pegah Azizi, Siddhartha Sarkar, Kai Sun, Stefano Gonella</i>
<p>So-called fragile topological states of matter challenge our conventional
notion of topology by lacking the robustness typically associated with
topological protection, thereby displaying elusive manifestations that are
difficult to harness for wave control. In this work, we leverage the recent
discovery of fragile topological states in special classes of structural kagome
lattices to document the availability of domain wall elastic wave modes that
are directly traceable to fragile topology and, yet, exhibit remarkably robust
signatures. We design twisted kagome bi-domains comprising two topologically
distinct sublattices - one trivial and the other fragile topological - sharing
a common bandgap and meeting at a domain wall. The two phases are achieved via
carefully engineered surface cut patterns that modify the band landscape of the
underlying lattices in complementary fashions, leading to dichotomous irreps
landscapes. Under these circumstances, a domain wall-bound mode emerges within
the shared bandgap and displays remarkable robustness against domain wall
orientation and defects. We corroborate these findings via k.p Hamiltonian and
Jackiw-Rabbi analysis and validate them experimentally through laser vibrometry
tests on a prototype endowed with water jet-induced perforation patterns.

<i>Harry Liu, Siddhartha Sarkar, A. Nafis Arafat, Ethan Stanifer, Stefano Gonella, Xiaoming Mao</i>
<p>Topological mechanical metamaterials have demonstrated exotic and robust
mechanical properties which led to promising engineering applications. One of
such properties is the focusing of stress at the interface connecting domains
of topological Maxwell lattices of opposite topological polarizations, which
protects the bulk of the material against fracturing. Here we generalize this
theory to non-ideal Maxwell lattices, incorporate real material features that
leads to interactions beyond previous ideal models. By quantitative analysis of
stress distributions of topological Maxwell lattices with self-stress
interfaces theoretically and computationally, we propose a design rule that
minimizes stress in the bulk of the material. This design rule can guide the
realization of stress focusing and fracturing protection in real materials.

<br>
<i>Alex Turzillo, Minyoung You</i>
<p>We study the interplay of duality and stacking of bosonic and fermionic
symmetry-protected topological phases in one spatial dimension. In general the
classifications of bosonic and fermionic phases have different group structures
under the operation of stacking, but we argue that they are often isomorphic
and give an explicit isomorphism when it exists. This occurs for all unitary
symmetry groups and many groups with antiunitary symmetries, which we
characterize. We find that this isomorphism is typically not implemented by the
Jordan-Wigner transformation, nor is it a consequence of any other duality
transformation that falls within the framework of topological holography. Along
the way to this conclusion, we recover the fermionic stacking rule in terms of
G-pin partition functions, give a gauge-invariant characterization of the
twisted group cohomology invariant, and state a procedure for stacking gapped
phases in the formalism of symmetry topological field theory.

<br>
<i>Yifan Yao, Arne Metzlaff, Andreas Wucher, Lukas Kalkhoff, Lars Breuer, Marika Schleberger, André Schleife</i>
<p>Secondary electrons that are emitted from materials under electron or ion
irradiation can serve as a detailed probe for electron-ion processes within the
target material. This requires a thorough understanding of their emission
characteristics, including intensity, duration, and kinetic energy
distribution. However, complicated multi-length and time scale relaxation
processes connect the initial non-equilibrium excited electron distribution
with their eventual emission as secondary electrons. The situation is pushed
even further into the non-equilibrium regime e.g. in two-dimensional materials
or when using beams with high ion flux. We combine first-principles real-time
electron dynamics simulations with modern experiments to characterize the
processes that are involved in secondary electron emission for
proton-irradiated graphene. From our data we identify signatures of kinetic and
potential emission mechanisms, by comparing secondary electron characteristics
for the entrance and exit side. Simulated yields on the exit side are higher by
a factor of up to 2.75, which agrees with experiment within a factor of two and
the simulated yield on the exit side of 0.53 electrons per ion also agrees with
a value of 0.4 measured for argon irradiated two-layer graphene. Our simulated
kinetic energy spectra match electron and ion irradiation experiments and prior
models, and provide detailed insight into the emission dynamics. The duration
of the emission pulse is only about 1.5 femto-seconds, pointing at high time
resolution when used as a probe. Finally, we show that secondary electron
emission is significantly increased from graphene with high lattice
temperature, whereas the influence of electronic temperature is negligible.

<h3>Tensor network renormalization: application to dynamic correlation  functions and non-hermitian systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Ying-Jie Wei, Zheng-Cheng Gu</i>
<p>In recent years, tensor network renormalization (TNR) has emerged as an
efficient and accurate method for studying (1+1)D quantum systems or 2D
classical systems using real-space renormalization group (RG) techniques. One
notable application of TNR is its ability to extract central charge and
conformal scaling dimensions for critical systems. In this paper, we present
the implementation of the Loop-TNR algorithm, which allows for the computation
of dynamical correlation functions. Our algorithm goes beyond traditional
approaches by not only calculating correlations in the spatial direction, where
the separation is an integer, but also in the temporal direction, where the
time difference can contain decimal values. Our algorithm is designed to handle
both imaginary-time and real-time correlations, utilizing a tensor network
representation constructed from a path-integral formalism. Additionally, we
highlight that the Loop-TNR algorithm can also be applied to investigate
critical properties of non-Hermitian systems, an area that was previously

<p>Inspired by the intermittent reorientation strategy seen in the behavior of
the dung beetle, we consider the problem of the navigation strategy of an
active Brownian particle moving in two dimensions. We assume that the heading
of the particle can be reoriented to the preferred direction by paying a fixed
cost as it tries to maximize its total displacement in a fixed direction. Using
optimal control theory, we derive analytically and confirm numerically the
strategy that maximizes the particle speed, and show that the average time
between reorientations scales inversely with the magnitude of the environmental
noise. We then extend our framework to describe execution errors and sensory
acquisition noise. Our approach may be amenable to other navigation problems
involving multiple sensory modalities that require switching between egocentric
and geocentric strategies.
