<h3>Work fluctuations of Brownian harmonic oscillators driven by  "active-like'' viscoelastic baths</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01996</a>

<i>Biswajit Das, Ayan Banerjee, Shuvojit Paul</i>

We experimentally and theoretically investigate the dynamics and work
fluctuations of an optically trapped micro-particle in a viscoelastic medium
driven by an external Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise. Compared to a viscous
medium of the same zero-shear viscosity, we find a significant increase ($\sim
50 \%$) in the mean transferred power from the external forcing of a fixed
noise strength to the particle due to the slow relaxation process of the
viscoelastic medium considered in this study. The memory of the viscoelastic
medium also leads to a small increase in the effective temperature of the
particle and a high fluctuation in the work done by the external forcing.
Consequently, as opposed to a viscous medium, negative work-fluctuations reduce
extremely fast. This leads to the violation of the work fluctuation theorem
(WFT) for a very small external noise, which may even be only $\sim 25\%$ of
the thermal noise strength in a non-Markovian viscoelastic bath. We further
show that all the experimental findings can be described excellently from the
Langevin dynamics of the process. Finally, we formulate the appropriate WFT for
such a system from the calculated work probability density function.

<h3>Identifying f-electron symmetries of UTe2 with O-edge resonant inelastic  X-ray scattering</h3>

<br>
The recent discovery of spin-triplet superconductivity emerging from a
non-magnetic parent state in UTe$_2$ has stimulated great interest in the
underlying mechanism of Cooper pairing. Experimental characterization of
short-range electronic and magnetic correlations is vital to understanding
these phenomena. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS), X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and atomic multiplet-based modeling to shed
light on the active debate between 5$f^2$6$d^1$-based models with singlet
crystal field states versus 5$f^3$-based models that predict atomic Kramers
doublets and much greater 5$f$ itinerancy. The XAS and RIXS data are found to
agree strongly with predictions for an 5$f^2$6$d^1$-like valence electron
configuration with weak intra-dimer magnetic correlations, and provide new
context for interpreting recent investigations of the electronic structure and
superconducting pairing mechanism.

The structural, electrical, optical, and mechanical characteristics of the
lead-free halide double perovskites Cs2NaTlX6 X = F, Cl, Br are calculated by
utilizing PBE functional within generalized gradient approximation GGA under
the context of density functional theory DFT.The structural properties such as
lattice parameter, cell volume, total energy, bulk modulus, pressure
derivative, and tolerance factor are computed at equilibrium.The electronic
density of states reveals the semiconducting nature of the compound and the
band structure exhibits the nature of the band gap to be direct.HSE06
functional is introduced to correct the underestimated band gap as obtained in
the GGA-PBE functional.The real and imaginary components of the dielectric
function, absorption coefficient, energy loss function, reflectivity,
refractive index, and extinction coefficient are analyzed and explained by
electronic structures.

<h3>Kondo frustration via charge fluctuations: a route to Mott localisation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02328" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02328</a>
<br>
<i>Abhirup Mukherjee, N. S. Vidhyadhiraja, A. Taraphder, Siddhartha Lal</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a minimal effective impurity model that captures the phenomenology
of the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition (MIT) of the half-filled Hubbard
model on the Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions as observed by dynamical mean
field theory (DMFT). This involves extending the standard Anderson impurity
model Hamiltonian to include an explicit Kondo coupling $J$, as well as a local
on-site correlation $U_b$ on the conduction bath site connected directly to the
impurity. For the case of attractive local bath correlations ($U_{b}<0$), the
extended Anderson impurity model (e-SIAM) sheds new light on several aspects of
the DMFT phase diagram. For example, the $T=0$ metal-to-insulator quantum phase
transition (QPT) is preceded by an excited state quantum phase transition
(ESQPT) where the local moment eigenstates are emergent in the low-lying
spectrum. Long-ranged fluctuations are observed near both the QPT and ESQPT,
suggesting that they are the origin of the quantum critical scaling observed
recently at high temperatures in DMFT simulations. The $T=0$ gapless
excitations at the QCP display particle-hole interconversion processes, and
exhibit power-law behaviour in self-energies and two-particle correlations.
These are signatures of non-Fermi liquid behaviour that emerge from the partial
breakdown of the Kondo screening.

<h3>X-ray holography of skyrmionic cocoons in aperiodic magnetic multilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02637" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02637</a>
<br>
<i>M. Grelier, R. Battistelli, H. Popescu, F. Godel, A. Vecchiola, S. Collin, C. Léveillé, K. Bouzehouane, F. Büttner, V. Cros, N. Jaouen, N. Reyren</i>
<br>
<br>
The development and characterization of three-dimensional (3D) topological
magnetic textures has become an important topic in modern magnetism both for
fundamental and technological perspectives. Among the novel 3D spin textures,
skyrmionic cocoons have been successfully stabilized in magnetic multilayers
having a variable thickness of the ferromagnet in the vertical direction of the
stack. These ellipsoidal 3D magnetic textures remain vertically confined in a
fraction of the total thickness while coexisting with fully columnar skyrmions.
Here, we use X-ray holography with about 15 nm lateral resolution to
investigate how their properties depend on the field and temperature. We
observe circular objects with different amplitude of contrast which evidences
the presence of different 3D objects located in various vertical parts of the
multilayer. Moreover, we witness during out-of-plane cycling an attractive
interaction between cocoons located at various heights, mainly due to the stray
field, which impacts their horizontal positioning. The X-ray holography
measurements also allow to determine the size of the cocoons at remanence
which, at room temperature, possess diameter close to 100 nm in average.
Combining this transmission technique with magnetic force microscopy and
micromagnetic simulations gives a precise insight into the 3D distribution of
the magnetization which demonstrate the 3D nature of skyrmionic cocoons.

<h3>Ferroelectric hafnia as an intrinsic ionic conductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02874" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02874</a>
<br>
<i>Guo-Dong Zhao, Xingen Liu, Zhongshan Xu, Wei Ren, Xiaona Zhu, David Wei Zhang, Shaofeng Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
The intensively concerned hafnia-based ferroelectric (FE) material has been
controversial over whether the origin of its observed ferroelectricity being
structural or electrochemical. We revisit the rigorous application of modern
theory of polarization on displacive FE-HfO2, and make clear the microscopic
mechanism of ionic conductance intertwined with continuous
nucleation-and-growth FE switching in HfO2 from first principles. Independent
from the involvement of vacancies, active oxygen ions in FE-HfO2 can be
collectively conducted along continuous FE uniaxial-connected-paths (UCPs) in a
typical nucleation-and-growth manner. The ionic conductance should have a
nonlinear electric-field dependence from the Merz's law, which is consistent
with the strongly correlated ionic conductance. Based on our established
physical picture, some abnormal experimental observations of HfO2 may be
explained beyond the pristine understanding of FE switching within double-well
potentials.

<h3>Interacting, running and tumbling: the active Dyson Brownian motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02937</a>
<br>
<i>Leo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal, Gregory Schehr</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce and study a model in one dimension of $N$ run-and-tumble
particles (RTP) which repel each other logarithmically in the presence of an
external quadratic potential. This is an "active'' version of the well-known
Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) where the particles are subjected to a telegraphic
noise, with two possible states $\pm$ with velocity $\pm v_0$. We study
analytically and numerically two different versions of this model. In model I a
particle only interacts with particles in the same state, while in model II all
the particles interact with each other. In the large time limit, both models
converge to a steady state where the stationary density has a finite support.
For finite $N$, the stationary density exhibits singularities, which disappear
when $N \to +\infty$. In that limit, for model I, using a Dean-Kawasaki
approach, we show that the stationary density of $+$ (respectively $-$)
particles deviates from the DBM Wigner semi-circular shape, and vanishes with
an exponent $3/2$ at one of the edges. In model II, the Dean-Kawasaki approach
fails but we obtain strong evidence that the density in the large $N$ limit
retains a Wigner semi-circular shape.

<h3>Hamiltonian cycles on Ammann-Beenker Tilings</h3>

<br>
<i>Shobhna Singh, Jerome Lloyd, Felix Flicker</i>
<br>
<br>
We provide a simple algorithm for constructing Hamiltonian graph cycles
(visiting every vertex exactly once) on the set of aperiodic two-dimensional
Ammann-Beenker (AB) tilings. Using this result, and the discrete scale symmetry
of AB tilings, we find exact solutions to a range of other problems including
the minimum dominating set problem, the domatic number problem, the longest
path problem, and the induced path problem. Of direct relevance to physics, we
solve the equalweight travelling salesperson problem, providing for example the
most efficient route a scanning tunneling microscope tip could take to image
the atoms of physical quasicrystals, and the 3-colouring problem, giving ground
states for the 3-state Potts model of magnetic interactions. We discuss the
adsorption of chain molecules onto quasicrystal surfaces, with possible
applications to catalysis.

<h3>Efficient Optimization of Deep Neural Quantum States Toward Machine  Precision</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01941" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01941</a>

Neural quantum states (NQSs) have emerged as a novel promising numerical
method to solve the quantum many-body problem. However, it has remained a
central challenge to train modern large-scale deep network architectures to
desired quantum state accuracy, which would be vital in utilizing the full
power of NQSs and making them competitive or superior to conventional numerical
approaches. Here, we propose a minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration (MinSR)
method that reduces the optimization complexity by orders of magnitude while
keeping similar accuracy as compared to conventional stochastic
reconfiguration. MinSR allows for accurate training on unprecedentedly deep NQS
with up to 64 layers and more than $10^5$ parameters in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg
$J_1$-$J_2$ models on the square lattice. We find that this approach yields
better variational energies as compared to existing numerical results and we
further observe that the accuracy of our ground state calculations approaches
different levels of machine precision on modern GPU and TPU hardware. The MinSR
method opens up the potential to make NQS superior as compared to conventional
computational methods with the capability to address yet inaccessible regimes
for two-dimensional quantum matter in the future.

<h3>The surface tension of bulky colloids, capillarity under gravity and the  microscopic origin of the KPZ equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01959</a>
<br>
<i>Luis G. MacDowell</i>
<br>
<br>
Experimental measurements of the surface tension of colloidal interfaces have
long been in conflict with computer simulations. In this work we show that the
surface tension of colloids as measured by surface fluctuations picks up a
gravity dependent contribution which removes the discrepancy. The presence of
this term puts a strong constraint on the structure of the interface which
allows one to identify missing contributions in the fundamental equation of
equilibrium capillarity and deduce bottom-up the microscopic origin of a growth
model with close relation to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

<h3>Elementary excitations of a system of one-dimensional chiral fermions  with short-range interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01964</a>
<br>
<i>K. A. Matveev</i>
<br>
<br>
We study general features of the excitation spectrum of a system of
one-dimensional chiral spinless fermions with short-range interactions. We show
that the nature of the elementary excitations of such a system depends strongly
on the nonlinearity of the underlying dispersion of the fermions. In the case
of quadratic nonlinearity, the low-momentum excitations are essentially
fermionic quasiparticles and quasiholes, whereas the high-momentum ones are
classical harmonic waves and solitons. In the case of cubic nonlinearity, the
nature of the elementary excitations does not depend on momentum and is
determined by the strength of the interactions. At a certain critical value of
the interaction strength the excitation spectrum changes qualitatively,
pointing to a dynamic phase transition in the system.

<h3>A first-principles method to calculate fourth-order elastic constants of  solid materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01965" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01965</a>
<br>
<i>Abhiyan Pandit, Angelo Bongiorno</i>
<br>
<br>
A first-principles method is presented to calculate elastic constants up to
the fourth order of crystals with the cubic and hexagonal symmetries. The
method relies on the numerical differentiation of the second Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor and a density functional theory approach to compute the Cauchy
stress tensors for a minimal list of strained configurations of a reference
state. The number of strained configurations required to calculate the
independent elastic constants of the second, third, and fourth order is 24 and
37 for crystals with the cubic and hexagonal symmetries, respectively. Here,
this method is applied to five crystalline materials with the cubic symmetry
(diamond, silicon, aluminum, silver, and gold) and two metals with the
hexagonal close packing structure (beryllium and magnesium). Our results are
compared to available experimental data and previous computational studies.
Calculated linear and nonlinear elastic constants are also used, within a
nonlinear elasticity treatment of a material, to predict values of volume and
bulk modulus at zero temperature over an interval of pressures. To further
validate our method, these predictions are compared to results obtained from
explicit density functional theory calculations.

<h3>Origin of Wake-Up Effect in Hafnia</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01981" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01981</a>
<br>
<i>Aldo Raeliarijaona, R. E. Cohen</i>
<br>
<br>
We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations on epitaxially
strained hafnia. We demonstrate the stabilization of the ferroelectric
($Pca2_{1}$) phase from the antiferroelectric ($Pbcn$) in bulk hafnia in the
presence of electric field. We found that the polar ($Pca2_{1}$) phase can be
efficiently stabilized with an adequate choice of film orientation. We show
that for a (010)-oriented Pbcn, the ferroelectric $Pca2_{1}$ phase can be
reached with a relatively small electric field ($\mid\varepsilon\mid\geq 150$
KV/m). We thus provide a simple explanation to the experimental observation of
polarization enhancement through electric field cycling, or wake-up effect, as
a ferroelectric phase transition driven by electric field. We find, in
contrast, that stress free pure hafnia does not become ferroelectric for any
reasonable electric field. So we explain the wake up effect and stabilization
of ferroelectric pure hafnia as coming from a combination of epitaxial strain
under applied electric field perpendicular to the film. We find that strain (or
doping) primarily destabilizes the baddeleyite structure, so that the
antiferroelectric Pbcn and ferroelectric phases can form.

<h3>Study of atomic disorder in Ni-V alloys</h3>

We present a pair distribution function (PDF) analysis from neutron
diffraction data of the Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$ alloy in the Ni-rich regime. Such
structural study aims to clarify the origin of the magnetic inhomogeneities
associated with the quantum Griffiths phase close to the
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic quantum phase transition. The PDF analysis
successfully reveals the details of the structure and chemical distribution of
our Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$ polycrystalline samples prepared with high-temperature
annealing and rapid cooling protocol. This study confirms the expectations that
all Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$ samples with 0$ \leq x \leq $0.15 crystallize in a single
phase fcc structure with some residual strain. The increase of the lattice
constant and the atomic displacement parameter with V-concentration $x$ is
consistently explained by a random occupation of V and Ni-atoms on the lattice,
with a radius ratio ($r_{V}/r_{Ni}$) of 1.05. Probing alternate, simple models
of the local PDF, such as V-clusters or ordered structures (Ni$_8$V, Ni$_3$V)
give inferior results compared to a random occupation. This investigation
strongly supports that the magnetic clusters in the binary alloy
Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$ originate from Ni-rich regions created from "random" occupation
rather than from chemical clusters. It reveals that Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$ is one of
the rare examples of a solid solution in a wide concentration regime (up to
x=0.15) persisting down to low temperatures (T=15 K).

<h3>A Highly Correlated Topological Bubble Phase of Composite Fermions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Strong interactions and topology drive a wide variety of correlated ground
states. Some of the most interesting of these ground states, such as fractional
quantum Hall states and fractional Chern insulators, have fractionally charged
quasiparticles. Correlations in these phases are captured by the binding of
electrons and vortices into emergent particles called composite fermions.
Composite fermion quasiparticles are randomly localized at high levels of
disorder and may exhibit charge order when there is not too much disorder in
the system. However, more complex correlations were predicted when composite
fermion quasiparticles cluster into a bubble, then these bubbles order on a
lattice. Such a highly correlated ground state was termed the bubble phase of
composite fermions. Here we report the observation of this bubble phase of
composite fermions, evidenced by the reentrance of the fractional quantum Hall
effect. We associate this reentrance with a bubble phase with two composite
fermion quasiparticles per bubble. Our results demonstrate the existence of a
new class of strongly correlated topological phases driven by clustering and
charge ordering of emergent quasiparticles.

<h3>Non-trivial topology in rare-earth monopnictides from dimensionality  reduction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02049</a>
<br>
<i>Dai Q. Ho, Ruiqi Hu, D. Quang To, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti</i>
<br>
<br>
Thin films of rare-earth monopnictide semimetals are expected to turn into
semiconductors due to quantum confinement effect, which lifts the overlap
between electron pockets at Brillouin zone edges and hole pockets at the zone
center. Instead, taking non-magnetic LaSb as an example, we find the emergence
of a quantum spin Hall insulator phase in LaSb(001) films as the thickness is
reduced to 7, 5, or 3 monolayers. This is attributed to a strong quantum
confinement effect on the in-plane electron pockets, and the lack of quantum
confinement on the out-of-plane pocket in reciprocal space projected onto zone
center, leading to a band inversion. Spin-orbit coupling opens a sizeable
non-trivial gap in the band structure of the thin films. Such effect is shown
to be general in rare-earth monopnictides and may lead to interesting phenomena
when coupled with the 4f magnetic moments present in other members of this
family of materials.

<h3>Smooth, homogeneous, high-purity Nb3Sn RF superconducting films by  seed-free electrochemical synthesis</h3>

<br>
<br>
Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) resonators are critical components for
particle accelerator applications and emerging quantum computers. A promising
SRF material is thin-film Nb3Sn with high-quality-factor, high-field,
high-operation-temperature potentials. However, surface roughness,
non-stoichiometry, and impurities in Nb3Sn deposited by conventional Sn-vapor
diffusion prevent their performance from reaching theoretical capabilities.
Here we design the deposition process involving seed-free electrochemical
synthesis and push the limit of chemical and physical properties in Nb3Sn.
Utilization of electrochemical Sn pre-deposits reduces the roughness of
converted Nb3Sn by five times compared to typical vapor-diffused Nb3Sn.
Quantitative mappings using chemical and atomic probes confirm improved
stoichiometry and minimized impurity concentrations in electrochemical Nb3Sn.
We have successfully applied this Nb3Sn to the large-scale 1.3 GHz SRF cavity
and demonstrated ultra-low BCS surface resistances at multiple operation
temperatures, notably lower than vapor-diffused cavities. Our smooth,
homogeneous, high-purity Nb3Sn provides the route toward high efficiency and
high fields for SRF use.

<h3>Calculating spin-lattice interactions in ferro- and antiferromagnets:  the role of symmetry, dimension and frustration</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02066" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02066</a>

Recently, the interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom has
gained a lot of attention due to its importance for various fundamental
phenomena as well as for spintronic and magnonic applications. Examples are
ultrafast angular momentum transfer between the spin and lattice subsystems
during ultrafast demagnetization, frustration driven by structural distortions
in transition metal oxides, or in acoustically driven spin-wave resonances. In
this work, we provide a systematic analysis of spin-lattice interactions for
ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials and focus on the role of lattice
symmetries and dimensions, magnetic order, and the relevance of spin-lattice
interactions for angular momentum transfer as well as magnetic frustration. For
this purpose, we use a recently developed scheme which allows an efficient
calculation of spin-lattice interaction tensors from first principles. In
addition to that, we provide a more accurate and self consistent scheme to
calculate ab initio spin lattice interactions by using embedded clusters which
allows to benchmark the performance of the scheme introduced previously.

<h3>Anomalous Scaling of Aeolian Sand Transport Reveals Coupling to Bed  Rheology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02067" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02067</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Predicting transport rates of windblown sand is a central problem in aeolian
research, with implications for climate, environmental, and planetary sciences.
Though studied since the 1930s, the underlying many-body dynamics is still
incompletely understood, as underscored by the recent empirical discovery of an
unexpected third-root scaling in the particle-fluid density ratio. Here, by
means of grain-scale simulations and analytical modeling, we elucidate how a
complex coupling between grain-bed collisions and granular creep within the
sand bed yields a dilatancy-enhanced bed erodibility. Our minimal saltation
model robustly predicts both the observed scaling and a new undersaturated
steady transport state that we confirm by simulations for rarefied atmospheres.

<h3>Ultra-Low Power Neuromorphic Obstacle Detection Using a Two-Dimensional  Materials-Based Subthreshold Transistor</h3>

Accurate, timely and selective detection of moving obstacles is crucial for
reliable collision avoidance in autonomous robots. The area- and
energy-inefficiency of CMOS-based spiking neurons for obstacle detection can be
addressed through the reconfigurable, tunable and low-power operation
capabilities of emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials-based devices. We
present an ultra-low power spiking neuron built using an electrostatically
tuned dual-gate transistor with an ultra-thin and generic 2D material channel.
The 2D subthreshold transistor (2D-ST) is carefully designed to operate under
low-current subthreshold regime. Carrier transport has been modelled via
over-the-barrier thermionic and Fowler-Nordheim contact barrier tunnelling
currents over a wide range of gate and drain biases. Simulation of a neuron
circuit designed using the 2D-ST with 45 nm CMOS technology components shows
high energy efficiency of ~3.5 pJ/spike and biomimetic class-I as well as
oscillatory spiking. It also demonstrates complex neuronal behaviors such as
spike-frequency adaptation and post-inhibitory rebound that are crucial for
dynamic visual systems. Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) is a
collision-detecting biological neuron found in locusts. Our neuron circuit can
generate LGMD-like spiking behavior and detect obstacles at an energy cost of
<100 pJ. Further, it can be reconfigured to distinguish between looming and
receding objects with high selectivity.

Triangular lattices are a promising platform for various magnetic phases and
potential applications. Here, we predict that monolayer CrTe obtained from

temperature. We show that the monolayer exhibits in-plane ferromagnetism and is
a half-metal with a large half-metal gap. It has a high magnetic transition
temperature (400 K), as indicated by our Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore,
the monolayer displays significant in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy, making it a viable candidate for spintronics and storage device
applications.

We investigate the occurrence of steady-state multi-stability in a cavity
system containing spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate and driven by a
strong pump laser. The applied magnetic field splits the Bose-Einstein
condensate into pseudo-spin states, which then became momentum sensitive with
two counter propagating Raman lasers directly interacting with ultra-cold
atoms. After governing the steady-state dynamics for all associated subsystems,
we show the emergence of multi-stable behavior of cavity photon number, which
is unlike with previous investigation on cavity-atom systems. However, this
multi-stability can be tuned with associated system parameters. Further, we
illustrate the occurrence of mixed-stability behavior for atomic population of
the pseudo spin-$\uparrow$ amd spin-$\downarrow$ states, which are appearing in
so-called bi-unstable form. The collective behavior of these atomic number
states interestingly possesses a transitional interface among the population of
both spin states, which can be enhance and controlled by spin-orbit coupling
and Zeeman field effects. Furthermore, we illustrate the emergence of secondary
interface mediated by increasing the mechanical dissipation rate of the
pseudo-spin states. These interfaces could be cause by the non-trivial behavior
of synthetic spin state mediated by cavity. Our findings are not only crucial
for the subject of optical switching, but also could provide foundation for
future studies on mechanical aspect of synthetic atomic states with cavity
quantum electrodynamics.

In this study, we demonstrate how the incorporation of appropriate feature
engineering together with the selection of a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm
that best suits the available dataset, leads to the development of a predictive
model for transformation temperatures that can be applied to a wide range of
shape memory alloys. We develop a gradient boosting ML surrogate model capable
of predicting Martensite Start, Martensite Finish, Austenite Start, and
Austenite Finish transformation temperatures with an average accuracy of more
than 95% by explicitly taking care of potential distribution changes when
modeling different alloy systems. We included heat treatment, rolling,
extrusion processing parameters, and alloy system categorical features in the
model input features to achieve more accurate and realistic results. In
addition, using Shapley values, which are calculated based on the average
marginal contribution of features to all possible coalitions, this study was
able to gain insights into the governing features and their effect on predicted
transformation temperatures, providing a unique opportunity to examine the
critical parameters and features in martensite transformation temperatures.

<br>
<br>
We calculate charge and heat current of charge carriers (electrons or holes),
originating from a temperature gradient and a chemical potential difference
between two ends of a tubular nanowire with different cross-sectional areas. We
consider a nanowire based on a semiconductor material, and use the
Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker approach to calculate the transport quantities. Values of
the heat and charge current are calculated in the presence of different
variations of impurities, with respect to the left temperature and left side
chemical potential. Results are obtained for a temperature regime from 1 to 420
K and chemical potential 35 to 225 meV. The temperature difference between two
sides is 35 K for all cases with a chemical potential difference of 5 meV.
Electronic transmission is compared for the main prismatic cross-section
geometries, in the presence of impurities of varying densities and strengths.

<br>
<br>
Atomic-scale charge transport properties are not only of significant
fundamental interest but also highly relevant for numerous technical
applications. However, experimental methods which are capable of detecting
charge transport at the relevant single-digit nanometer length scales are
scarce. Here we report on molecular nanoprobe (MONA) experiments on Pd(110)
where we utilize the charge carrier-driven switching of a single cis-2-butene
molecule to detect ballistic transport properties over length scales of a few
nanometers. Our data demonstrate a striking angular dependence with a dip in
charge transport along the [1-10]-oriented atomic rows and a peak in the
transverse [001] direction. The narrow angular width of both features and
distance-dependent measurements suggest that the nanometer-scale ballistic
transport properties of metallic surfaces is significantly influenced by the
atomic structure.

<br>
<br>
We investigate coherent matter wave transport in isotropic 3D speckle
potentials by using the Bethe-Salper equation and the self-consistent theory of
localization. This model constitutes an efficient tool to properly evaluate
corrections to Boltzmann diffusion by taking into consideration quantum
interference terms between the multiple-scattering paths. We calculate
analytically and numerically the static current density, the density of states,
the dipolar contribution and the reduced diffusion coefficient. Our results
reveal that quantum corrections to diffusive transport, known as weak
localization may not only lead to shift the above quantities but affect also
the position of the mobility edge.

<h3>A Lévy flight for electrons in graphene: superdiffusive-to-diffusive  transport transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work we propose an electronic L\'evy flight device, analogous to a
recent optical realization. To that end, we investigate the transmission of
electrons in graphene nanoribbons in the presence of circular electrostatic
clusters, whose diameter follow a power-law distribution. We analyze the effect
of the electrostatic clusters on the electronic transport regime of the
nanoribbons, in terms of its diffusion behavior. Our numerical calculations
show that the presence of circular electrostatic clusters induces a transition
from L\'evy (superdiffusive) to diffusive transport as the energy increases.
Furthermore, we argue that in our electronic L\'evy flight device,
superdiffusive transport is an exclusive feature of the low-energy quantum
regime, while diffusive transport is a feature of the semiclassical regime.
Therefore, we attribute the observed transition to the chiral symmetry
breaking, once the energy moves away from the Dirac point of graphene.

<h3>Tailoring magnetic hysteresis of Fe-Ni permalloy by additive  manufacturing: Multiphysics-multiscale simulations of process-property  relationships</h3>

<br>
<br>
Designing the microstructure of Fe-Ni permalloy by additive manufacturing
(AM) opens new avenues to tailor the materials' magnetic properties. Yet,
AM-produced parts suffer from spatially inhomogeneous thermal-mechanical and
magnetic responses, which are less investigated in terms of process simulation
and modeling schemes. Here we present a powder-resolved multiphysics-multiscale
simulation scheme for describing magnetic hysteresis in materials produced via
AM. The underlying physical processes are explicitly considered, including the
coupled thermal-structural evolution, chemical order-disorder transitions, and
associated thermo-elasto-plastic behaviors. The residual stress is identified
as the key thread in connecting the physical processes and in-process phenomena
across scales. By employing this scheme, we investigate the dependence of the
fusion zone size, the residual stress and plastic strain, and the magnetic
hysteresis of AM-produced Fe21.5Ni78.5 permalloy on beam power and scan speed.
Simulation results also suggest a phenomenological relation between magnetic
coercivity and average residual stress, which can guide the magnetic hysteresis
design of soft magnetic materials by choosing appropriate AM-process
parameters.

<h3>Distinct melting behaviour of partially oxidized Cu nanoparticles and  nanowires</h3>

<br>

While most of the experimental studies are dealing with partially oxidized
metallic nanosolids, their behaviour is not well understood theoretically. To
this end we utilized molecular dynamics simulation and charge-optimized
many-body potential to probe melting of Cu nanoparticles and nanowires with and
without a monolayer of Cu$_2$O as a shell. It is shown that partially oxidized
nanosolids present a different melting behaviour than the widely accepted
picture of melting, and especially different than surface melting. (i) For both
types of nanosolids we observed inward diffusion of $\sim$40\% of atomic oxygen
into the metallic core at room temperature. (ii) For the nanowire with oxide
shell we observed a solid state phase transition in the Cu core that is not
present for the case without the oxide. (iii) Prior to melting, the oxide shell
shrinks, and this process continues after melting, to form a particulate oxide,
for both types of nanosolids.

<h3>Proposal that interpretation of field emission current-voltage  characteristics should be treated as a specialized form of electrical  engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02226" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02226</a>
<br>
<i>Richard G. Forbes</i>
<br>
<br>
This article proposes that we should think differently about predicting and
interpreting measured field electron emission (FE) current-voltage [I(V)]
characteristics. It is commonly assumed that I(V) data interpretation is a
problem in emission physics and related electrostatics. Many experimentalists
then apply Fowler-Nordheim plot methodology, developed in 1929. However, with
modern emitting materials this 90-year-old interpretation methodology often
fails (maybe in nearly 50% of cases), and yields spurious values for
characterization parameters, particularly field enhancement factors. This has
generated an unreliable literature, and validity checks on experimental I(V)
data are nearly always needed before use. A new check, supplementing existing
checks, is described. Twelve different "system complications" that, acting
singly or in combinations, can cause validity-check failure are identified. A
top-level path forwards from this unsatisfactory situation is proposed. The
term "field electron emission system (FE system)" is defined to include all
aspects of an experimental system that affect the measured I(V)
characteristics. The analysis of FE systems should now be regarded as a
specialized form of electronic/electrical engineering, provisionally called "FE
Systems Engineering". In this approach, the I(V) relationship is split: (a) the
current is expressed as a function I(F_C) of the local surface-field magnitude
F_C at some defined emitter surface location "C"; and (b) the relationship
between F_C and measured voltage V is expressed and determined separately.
Determining I(F_C) is mostly a problem in emission physics; determining the
relationship (F_C)(V) depends on system electrostatics and (for systems failing
a validity check) on other aspects of FE Systems Engineering. The scope of FE
Systems Engineering, and some related research implications and problems, are
outlined.

<h3>How to predict critical state: Invariance of Lyapunov exponent in dual  spaces</h3>

The critical state in disordered systems, a fascinating and subtle
eigenstate, has attracted a lot of research interest. However, the nature of
the critical state is difficult to describe quantitatively. Most of the studies
focus on numerical verification, and cannot predict the system in which the
critical state exists. In this work, we propose an explicit and universal
criterion that for the critical state Lyapunov exponent should be 0
simultaneously in dual spaces, namely Lyapunov exponent remains invariant under
Fourier transform. With this criterion, we exactly predict a specific system
hosting a large number of critical states for the first time. Then, we perform
numerical verification of the theoretical prediction, and display the
self-similarity and scale invariance of the critical state. Finally, we
conjecture that there exist some kind of connection between the invariance of
the Lyapunov exponent and conformal invariance.

Among the exotic and yet unobserved features of multi-channel Kondo impurity
models is their sub-unitary single electron scattering. In the two-channel
Kondo model, for example, an incoming electron is fully scattered into a
many-body excitation such that the single particle Green function vanishes.
Here we propose to directly observe these features in a charge-Kondo device
encapsulated in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer - within a device already studied
in Ref.[1]. We provide detailed predictions for the visibility and phase of the
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations depending on the number of coupled channels and the
asymmetry of their couplings.

Synthesis prediction is a key accelerator for the rapid design of advanced
materials. However, determining synthesis variables such as the choice of
precursor materials, operations, and conditions is challenging for inorganic
materials because the sequence of reactions during heating is not well
understood. In this work, we use a knowledge base of 29,900 solid-state
synthesis recipes, text-mined from the scientific literature, to automatically
learn which precursors to recommend for the synthesis of a novel target
material. The data-driven approach learns chemical similarity of materials and
refers the synthesis of a new target to precedent synthesis procedures of
similar materials, mimicking human synthesis design. When proposing five
precursor sets for each of 2,654 unseen test target materials, the
recommendation strategy achieves a success rate of at least 82%. Our approach
captures decades of heuristic synthesis data in a mathematical form, making it
accessible for use in recommendation engines and autonomous laboratories.

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that standing acoustic waves can
trap particles that range in size from microns to millimeters. Powerful
tweezers may trap clusters of particles rather than single ones because their
trapping radius is substantially larger than the size of the trapped particle.
In this study, clusters of polystyrene particles measuring 450 microns in size
that were suspended in an ionic surfactant solution were trapped at the nodes
of acoustic standing waves. The correlation between surfactant concentration
and threshold radius is examined, and potential mechanisms that could be
responsible for the phenomenon are investigated. The findings demonstrated that
adding polystyrene made clusters unstable and caused them to spontaneously
rupture. Additionally, studies revealed that the cluster began to undergo
spontaneous sequential ruptures after its radius above a particular threshold.

We study the electronic and magnetic states of as-grown and annealed
$M\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_4$(111)/$\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$(111) ($M=\text{Co, Ni}$)
thin films with various thicknesses grown on Si(111) substrates with the
$\gamma$-$\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$(111) buffer layers by using x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), to investigate
magnetically dead layers in these films. Although the magnetically dead layers
in the as-grown samples are formed near the interface with the
$\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ buffer layer, we reveal that ferrimagnetic order is
partially recovered by post-deposition annealing at 973 K for 48 hours in air.
By analyzing the line shapes of the XAS and XMCD spectra, we conclude that, in
the dead layers, there are a significant number of vacancies at the $T_d$ sites
of the spinel structure, which may be the microscopic origin of the degraded
ferrimagnetic order in the $M\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_4$(111) thin films.

<h3>Holographic principle tells why maximum entropy principle, lognormal  distribution, self-preserving and self-organization appearing in system  evolutions across science</h3>

<br>
<br>
By applying the holographic principle that comes from black hole physics and
information entropy (Sient) introduced by Claude Shannon, we derive the
mechanism of similar patterns or tendencies appearing in evolution processes of
different systems: maximum entropy principle, power law and lognormal
distributions, self preserving and self organization. Taking a system of
atmospheric particles as an example, we prove both self preserving and
lognormal distribution patterns are caused by maximum information entropy
principle (MIEP); By deducing thermodynamic entropy (Stent) is a form of Sient,
and building up a particle system approaching a part of the holographic screen,
the information probability statistics of particle number size distribution are
realized on the holographic screen, resulting in the presence of information
entropic force (Fient). Fient drives the system to evolve in the direction of
MIEP. Owing to the initial state, the evolution can undergo an increasing Sient
and enhanced discretization, or a decreasing Sient and weakened discretization.
The latter process corresponds to the system evolution tendency of self
organization; by introducing Fient into the flow field, the field for fluid
system evolution is unified including Fient, Sient, the Newton potential, the
diffusion process, and Navier Stokes equations, indicating that the atmospheric
particle dynamics could be driven by Fient. By numerical simulations of
particle collisions and coagulation based on the Smoluchowski equation, we
prove the evolution of the particle system is indeed information distributing,
inherited from the initial state, measured by information probability,
evaluated by Sient, and driven by Fient. We further prove wave function for
quantum mechanism also satisfies MIEP. The findings indicate holographic
principle can guide system evolution towards certain desirable patterns and
outcomes.

The class of Ruddlesden-Popper type (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ perovskites comprises
two-dimensional (2D) structures whose optical properties are determined by
excitons with a large binding energy of about 260 meV. It complements the
family of other 2D semiconductor materials by having the band structure typical
for lead halide perovskites, that can be considered as inverted compared to
conventional III-V and II-VI semiconductors. Accordingly, novel spin phenomena
can be expected for them. Spin-flip Raman scattering is used here to measure
the Zeeman splitting of electrons and holes in a magnetic field up to 10 T.
From the recorded data, the electron and hole Land\'e factors ($g$-factors) are
evaluated, their signs are determined, and their anisotropies are measured. The
electron $g$-factor value changes from $+2.11$ out-of-plane to $+2.50$
in-plane, while the hole $g$-factor ranges between $-0.13$ and $-0.51$. The
spin flips of the resident carriers are arranged via their interaction with
photogenerated excitons. Also the double spin-flip process, where a resident
electron and a resident hole interact with the same exciton, is observed
showing a cumulative Raman shift. Dynamic nuclear spin polarization induced by
spin-polarized holes is detected in corresponding changes of the hole Zeeman
splitting. An Overhauser field of the polarized nuclei acting on the holes as
large as $0.6$ T can be achieved.

We investigate the thermal transport properties in
superconductor-antiferromagnet-superconductor and
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junctions based on buckled
two-dimensional materials (BTDMs). Owing to the unique buckled sublattice
structures of BTDMs, in both junctions the phase dependence of the thermal
conductance can be effectively controlled by perpendicular electric fields. The
underlying mechanism for the electrical tunability of thermal conductance is
elucidated resorting to the band structures of the magnetic regions. We also
reveal the distinct manifestations of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic
exchange fields in the thermal conductance. These results demonstrate that the
perpendicular electric field can serve as a knob to externally manipulate the
phase-coherent thermal transport in BTDMs-based Josephson junctions.

strain. Within density functional theory augmented by mean-field treatement of
on-site electronic correlations, the ground states show remarkable dependence
on the correlation strength and the strain. In the weakly and intermediately
correlated regimes with small epitaxial strain, the charge-disproportionated
insulating states with antiferromagneitc order is favored over the other
orbital and spin ordered phases. On the other hand, in the strongly correlated
regime or under the large tensile strain, ferromagnetic spin states with
Jahn-Teller orbital order become most stable. The effect from polar interfaces

Instrumented spherical nanoindentation with a continuous stiffness
measurement has gained increased popularity in material science studies in
brittle and ductile materials alike. These investigations span hypotheses
related to a wide range of microphysics involving grain boundaries, twins,
dislocation densities, ion-induced damage and more. These studies rely on the
implementation of different methodologies for instrument calibration and for
circumventing tip shape imperfections. In this study, we test, integrate, and
re-adapt published strategies for tip and machine-stiffness calibration for
spherical tips. We propose a routine for independently calibrating the
effective tip radius and the machine stiffness using three reference materials
(fused silica, sapphire, glassy carbon), which requires the parametrization of
the effective radius as a function of load. We validate our proposed workflow
against key benchmarks, such as variation of Young's modulus with depth. We
apply the resulting calibrations to data collected in materials with varying
ductility (olivine, titanium, and tungsten) to extract indentation
stress-strain curves. We also test the impact of the machine stiffness on
recently proposed methods for identification of yield stress, and compare the
influence of different conventions on assessing the indentation size effect.
Finally, we synthesize these analysis routines in a single workflow for use in
future studies aiming to extract and process data from spherical

At low temperatures, iron monosilicide is a strongly correlated narrow-gap

field was observed for the first time at 355 T in Ref. [Yu. B. Kudasov et al.,
JETP Lett. 68 (1998) 350]. However, recently a smooth transition from 230 T to
270 T was found under similar conditions in Ref. [D. Nakamura et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 127 (2021) 156601]. This discrepancy goes far beyond experimental
errors and deserves a careful study. A methodological analysis of inductive and
RF techniques of conductivity measurements shows that the difference of these
critical magnetic field estimations stems from a divergence in dynamic ranges
of the techniques. In fact, the above mentioned methods supplement each other.
The semiconductor-metal transition under magnetic field in FeSi is a complex

<h3>Dramatic enhancement of visible-light absorption in TiO2 by adding Bi</h3>

<br>

TiO2 is a wide band-gap semiconductor that has been intensively investigated
for photocatalysis and water-spiting. However, weak light absorption in the
visible region of the spectrum poses stringent limitation to its practical
application. Doping of TiO2 with N or transition-metal impurities has been
explored to shift the onset of optical absorption to the visible region, yet
with limited success. Based on hybrid density functional calculations, we
propose adding Bi to TiO2, in the form of dilute Ti_(1-x)Bi_(x)O2 alloys, to
efficiently shift the optical absorption to the visible region. Compared to N,
Bi introduces an intermediate valence band that is significantly higher in the
band gap, and leaves the conduction band almost unchanged, leading to a
remarkable redshift in the absorption coefficient to cover almost all the
visible-light spectrum. Comparing formation enthalpies, our results show that
adding Bi costs significantly less energy than N in oxidizing conditions, and
that Ti_(1-x)Bi_(x)O2 might make a much more efficient photocatalyst than
TiO_(2-y)N_(y) for water splitting.

In this paper we announce the public release of a massively-parallel,
GPU-accelerated software, which is the first to combine both coarse-grained
molecular dynamics and field-theoretical simulations in one simulation package.
MATILDA.FT (Mesoscale, Accelerated, Theoretically-Informed, Langevin,
Dissipative particle dynamics, and Field Theory) was designed from the
ground-up to run on CUDA-enabled GPUs, with the Thrust library acceleration,
enabling it to harness the possibility of massive parallelism to efficiently
simulate systems on a mesoscopic scale. MATILDA.FT is a versatile software,
enabling the users to use either Langevin dynamics or Field Theory to model
their systems - all within the same software. It has been used to model a
variety of systems, from polymer solutions, and nanoparticle-polymer
interfaces, to coarse-grained peptide models, and liquid crystals. MATILDA.FT
is written in CUDA/C++ and is object oriented, making its source-code easy to
understand and extend. The software comes with dedicated post-processing and
analysis tools, as well as the detailed documentation and relevant examples.
Below, we present an overview of currently available features. We explain in
detail the logic of parallel algorithms and methods. We provide necessary
theoretical background, and present examples of recent research projects which
utilized MATILDA.FT as the simulation engine. We also demonstrate how the code
can be easily extended, and present the plan for the future development. The
source code, along with the documentation, additional tools and examples can be
found on GitHub repository.

<h3>Prediction of non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect at  $ν{=}2{+}4/11$</h3>

The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in the second Landau level (SLL)
likely stabilizes non-Abelian topological orders. Recently, a parton sequence
has been proposed to capture many of the fractions observed in the SLL [Ajit C.
Balram, SciPost Phys. {\bf 10}, 083 (2021)]. We consider the first member of
this sequence which has not yet been studied, which is a non-Abelian state that
occurs at $4/11$. As yet FQHE in the SLL at this fraction has not been observed
in experiments. Nevertheless, by studying its competition with other candidate
FQHE states in the SLL we show that this parton state might be viable. We also
make predictions for experimentally measurable properties of the parton state
which can distinguish it from other topological orders.

Coherent control of ensembles of light emitters by means of multi-wave mixing
processes is key for the realization of high capacity optical quantum memories
and information processing devices. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots
placed in optical microcavities represent excellent candidates to explore
strong light-matter interactions beyond the limits of perturbative non-linear
optics and control the unitary evolution of optically driven quantum systems.
In this work, we demonstrate that a sequence of two optical picosecond pulses
can be used to establish coherent control over the phase evolution of the
ensemble of trions in (In,Ga)As quantum dots independent of their initial
quantum state. Our approach is based on coherent transfer between degenerate
multi-wave-mixing signals in the strong field limit where Rabi rotations in
multi-level systems take place. In particular, we use the two-pulse photon echo
sequence to uncover the coherent dynamics of the trion ensemble, whereas the
areas of two additional control pulses serve as tuning knobs for adjusting the
magnitude and timing of the coherent emission. Furthermore, we make use of the
spin degeneracy of ground and excited state of trions to control the
polarization state of the emitted signal. Surprisingly, we reveal that the use
of optical control pulses, whose durations are comparable to the dephasing time
of the ensemble, lifts the temporal degeneracy between wave-mixing processes of
different order. This phenomenon is manifested in a significant modification of
the temporal shape of the coherent optical response for strong optical fields.
Lifting the temporal degeneracy allows to smoothly trace the transition from
the perturbative to the regime of Rabi rotations and opens up new possibilities
for the optical investigation of complex energy level structures in so far
unexplored material systems.

<h3>The principle of learning sign rules by neural networks in qubit lattice  models</h3>

A neural network is a powerful tool for generalizing hidden laws beyond human
intuition; however, it looks like a black box due to complicated nonlinear
structures. Based on the Gutzwiller mean-field theory, we exhibit a principle
of learning sign rules for the ordered states in qubit lattice models.
Accordingly, we construct a shallow feed-forward neural network with a single
hidden neuron and systematically make benchmarks in the generalized Ising, XY,
frustrated Heisenberg chains, antiferromagnetic XY on the triangle lattice, and
the Fermi-Hubbard chain at an arbitrary filling. All the leading-order or
mean-field sign rule characters are visualized in classical forms, such as the
gauge field gradient, pitch angles, etc. Besides, quantum fluctuations violate
the sign rule and quantitatively yield an imperfect accuracy rate in the
prediction.

<h3>Local and global measures of the shear moduli of jammed disk packings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02545</a>

<br>
<br>
Strain-controlled isotropic compression gives rise to jammed packings of
repulsive, frictionless disks with either positive or negative global shear
moduli. We carry out computational studies to understand the contributions of
the negative shear moduli to the mechanical response of jammed disk packings.
We first decompose the ensemble-averaged, global shear modulus as $\langle
G\rangle = (1-{\cal F}_-) \langle G_+ \rangle + {\cal F}_- \langle G_-\rangle$,
where ${\cal F}_-$ is the fraction of jammed packings with negative shear
moduli and $\langle G_+\rangle$ and $\langle G_-\rangle$ are the average values
from packings with positive and negative moduli, respectively. We show that
$\langle G_+\rangle$ and $\langle|G_-|\rangle$ obey different power-law scaling
relations above and below $pN^2 \sim 1$. We then calculate analytically that
${\cal P}(G)$ is a Gamma distribution in the $pN^2 \ll 1$ limit. As $pN^2$
increases, the skewness of ${\cal P}(G)$ decreases and ${\cal P}(G)$ becomes a
skew-normal distribution with negative skewness in the $pN^2 \gg 1$ limit. We
also partition jammed disk packings into subsystems using Delanunay
triangulation of the disk centers to calculate local shear moduli. We show that
the local shear moduli defined from groups of adjacent triangles can be
negative even when $G > 0$. The spatial correlation function of local shear
moduli $C({\vec r})$ displays weak correlations for $pn_{\rm sub}^2 < 10^{-2}$,
where $n_{\rm sub}$ is the number of particles within each subsystem. However,
$C({\vec r})$ begins to develop long-ranged spatial correlations with four-fold
angular symmetry for $pn_{\rm sub}^2 \gtrsim 10^{-2}$.

<h3>Anisotropic Lattice Expansion of Monolayer WSe2 Revealed by Ultrafast  Electron Diffraction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bulk layered MX2 transition metal chalcogenides (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se) are
known to exhibit an indirect to direct band gap transition as the number of
layers is reduced. Previous time-resolved work has principally focused on the
investigation of the transient evolution of the band structure after
photo-excitation, but additional information on the dynamics of the concomitant
lattice rearrangement is needed to fully understand this phenomenon. Here,
ultrafast electron diffraction is used to probe the atomic motion and bond
dilation in monolayer WSe2 with femtosecond temporal resolution. The change in
the intensity of the Bragg diffraction spots is characterized by
single-exponential dynamics, consistent with a collective response of the
lattice during electron-phonon and phonon-phonon equilibration that is
repeatable over many hours of illumination with ultrafast pulses. Moreover, a
transient and highly anisotropic lattice expansion is observed. A possible
explanation for this behavior is axial strain induced by the laser excitation
that breaks the degeneracy of the in-plane phonon modes, and that strongly
influences the electronic band structure. Such degeneracy-breaking induced by
distortions in the lattice are well characterized in static strain
measurements, and the results presented here provide valuable insights into the
nature and time scales of the structural rearrangement that occurs following
optical photo-excitation in monolayer tungsten diselenide.

<h3>Stochastic Gradient Descent-induced drift of representation in a  two-layer neural network</h3>

<br>
<br>
Representational drift refers to over-time changes in neural activation
accompanied by a stable task performance. Despite being observed in the brain
and in artificial networks, the mechanisms of drift and its implications are
not fully understood. Motivated by recent experimental findings of
stimulus-dependent drift in the piriform cortex, we use theory and simulations
to study this phenomenon in a two-layer linear feedforward network.
Specifically, in a continual learning scenario, we study the drift induced by
the noise inherent in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By decomposing the
learning dynamics into the normal and tangent spaces of the minimum-loss
manifold, we show the former correspond to a finite variance fluctuation, while
the latter could be considered as an effective diffusion process on the
manifold. We analytically compute the fluctuation and the diffusion
coefficients for the stimuli representations in the hidden layer as a function
of network parameters and input distribution. Further, consistent with
experiments, we show that the drift rate is slower for a more frequently
presented stimulus. Overall, our analysis yields a theoretical framework for
better understanding of the drift phenomenon in biological and artificial
neural networks.

<h3>Effects of Average Number of Platelets Through the Thickness and  Platelet Width on the Mechanical Properties of Discontinuous Fiber Composites</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigate the evolution of
the tensile material properties of Discontinuous Fiber Composites (DFCs) with
an increasing average number of platelets through the thickness for two
different platelet widths. The results show that both the number of platelets
and the platelet width have significant effects on the tensile modulus and
strength. We find that not only the average mechanical properties but also
their coefficients of variation change according to the different DFC
mesostructures. To understand the relationship between material morphology at
the mesoscale and corresponding material properties, we developed a random
platelet mesostructure generation algorithm combined with explicit finite
element models. Leveraging the computational tools, we find that moduli and
strength increase with increasing average number of platelets through the
thickness. The increasing trend continues until reaching an asymptotic limit at
about 45 layers through the thickness for the narrow platelets and 27 layers
for the square platelets. In the study, we address the importance of having
accurate simulations of the mesostructure to match not only the average modulus
and strength but also their associated coefficients of variation. We show that
it is possible to accurately predict the tensile material properties of DFCs,
including their B-basis design values. This is a quintessential condition for
the adoption of DFCs in structural applications.

<h3>Critical behaviors of cascading dynamics on multiplex two-dimensional  lattices</h3>

We study the critical phenomena of viable clusters in multiplex
two-dimensional lattices using numerical simulations. We identify viable sites
on multiplex lattices using two cascading algorithms: the cascade of
activations (CA) and deactivations (CD). We found that the giant viable
clusters identified by CA and CD processes exhibit different critical
behaviors. Specifically, the critical phenomena of CA processes are consistent
with the ordinary bond percolation on a single layer but CD processes exhibit
the critical behaviors consistent with mutual percolation on multiplex
lattices. In addition, we computed the susceptibility of cascading dynamics by
using the concept of ghost field. Our results suggest that the CA and CD
processes generate viable clusters in different ways.

Atom probe tomography has been raising in prominence as a microscopy and
microanalysis technique to gain sub-nanoscale information from
technologically-relevant materials. However, the analysis of some functional
ceramics, particularly perovskites, has remained challenging with extremely low
yield and success rate. This seems particularly problematic for materials with
high piezoelectric activity, which may be difficult to express at the low
temperatures necessary for satisfactory atom probe analysis. Here, we
demonstrate the analysis of commercial BaTiO3 particles embedded in a metallic
matrix. Density-functional theory shows that a metallic coating prevents charge
penetration of the electrostatic field, and thereby suppresses the associated
volume associated change linked to the piezoelectric effect.

Pd-based electro-catalysts are a key component to improve the methanol
oxidation reaction (MOR) kinetics from alcohol fuel cells. However, the
performance of such catalysts is degraded over time. To understand the
microstructural/atomic scale chemical changes responsible for such effect,
scanning (transmission) electron microscopies and atom probe tomography (APT)
were performed after accelerated degradation tests (ADT). No morphological
changes are observed after 1000 MOR cycles. Contrastingly, (1) Pd and B are
leached from PdAu nanoparticles and (2) Au-rich regions are formed at the
surface of the catalyst. These insights highlight the importance of
understanding the chemical modification undergoing upon MOR to design superior
catalysts.

<h3>Tensor Network Based Finite-Size Scaling for Two-Dimensional Classical  Models</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a scheme to perform tensor network based finite-size scaling
analysis for two-dimensional classical models. In the tensor network
representation of the partition function, we use higher-order tensor
renormalization group (HOTRG) method to coarse grain the weight tensor. The
renormalized tensor is then used to construct the approximated transfer matrix
of an infinite strip of finite width. By diagonalizing the transfer matrix we
obtain the correlation length, the magnetization, and the energy density which
are used in finite-size scaling analysis to determine the critical temperature
and the critical exponents. As a benchmark we study the two-dimensional
classical Ising model. We show that the critical temperature and the critical
exponents can be accurately determined. With HOTRG bond dimension $D=70$, the
absolute errors of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical exponent
$\nu$, $\beta$ are at the order of $10^{-7}, 10^{-5}$, $10^{-4}$ respectively.
Furthermore, the results can be systematically improved by increasing the bond
dimension of the HOTRG method. Finally, we study the length scale induced by
the finite cut-off in bond dimension and elucidate its physical meaning in this
context.

Introduction of interstitial dopants has opened a new pathway to optimize
nanoparticle catalytic activity for, e.g., hydrogen evolution/oxidation and
other reactions. Here, we discuss the stability of a property-enhancing dopant,
B, introduced through controlled synthesis of an electrocatalyst Pd aerogel. We
observe significant removal of B after the hydrogen evolution/oxidation
reaction. Ab-initio calculations show that the high stability of sub-surface B
in Pd is substantially reduced when H is ad/absorbed on the surface, favoring
its departure from the host nanostructure. The destabilization of sub-surface B
is more pronounced as more H occupies surface sites and empty interstitial
sites. We hence demonstrate that the H2 fuel/product itself favors the
microstructural degradation of the electrocatalyst and an associated drop in
activity.

<br>
Topological magnetic structures are promising candidates for resilient
information storage. An elementary example are spin helices in one-dimensional
easy-plane quantum magnets. To quantify their stability, we numerically
implement the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation and time-dependent perturbation
theory for spin chains with fluctuating local magnetic fields. We find two
classes of quantum spin helices that can reach and even exceed ground-state
stability: Spin-current-maximizing helices and, for fine-tuned boundary
conditions, the recently discovered "phantom helices". Beyond that, we show
that the helicity itself (left- or right-rotating) is even more stable. We
explain these findings by separated helical sectors and connect them to
topological sectors in continuous spin systems. The resulting helical
protection mechanism is a promising phenomenon towards stabilizing helical
quantum structures, e.g., in ultracold atoms and solid state systems. We also
identify an - up to our knowledge - previously unknown new type of phantom
helices.

<h3>Temperature dependent anisotropy and two-band superconductivity revealed  by lower critical field in organic superconductor  $κ$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Br</h3>

Resistivity and magnetization have been measured at different temperatures
and magnetic fields in organic superconductors
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Br. The lower critical field and upper
critical field are determined, which allow to depict a complete phase diagram.
Through the comparison between the upper critical fields with magnetic field
perpendicular and parallel to the conducting ac-planes, and the scaling of the
in-plane resistivity with field along different directions, we found that the
anisotropy $\Gamma$ is strongly temperature dependent. It is found that
$\Gamma$ is quite large (above 20) near $T_{c}$, which satisfies the 2D model,
but approaches a small value in the low-temperature region. The 2D-Tinkham
model can also be used to fit the data at high temperatures. This is explained
as a crossover from the orbital depairing mechanism in high-temperature and
low-field region to the paramagnetic depairing mechanism in the high-field and
low-temperature region. The temperature dependence of lower critical field
$H_{c1} (T)$ shows a concave shape in wide temperature region. It is found that
neither a single $d$-wave nor a single $s$-wave gap can fit the $H_{c1} (T)$,
however a two-gap model containing an $s$-wave and a $d$-wave can fit the data
rather well, suggesting two-band superconductivity and an unconventional
pairing mechanism in this organic superconductor.

<br>
<br>
Type-II Weyl semimetal candidate MoTe$_2$, which superconducts at T_c~0.1 K,
is one of the promising candidates for realizing topological superconductivity.
However, the exceedingly low $T_c$ is associated with a small upper critical
field ($H_{c2}$), implying a fragile superconducting phase that only exists on
a small region of the $H$-$T$ phase diagram. Here, we describe a simple and
versatile approach based on the differential thermal expansion between
dissimilar materials to subject a thin single crystalline MoTe$_2$ to biaxial
strain. With this approach, we successfully enhance the $T_c$ of MoTe$_2$
five-fold and consequently expand the superconducting region on the $H$-$T$
phase diagram significantly. To demonstrate the relative ease of studying the
superconductivity in the biaxially strained MoTe$_2$, we further present the
magnetotransport data, enabling the study of the temperature-dependent $H_{c2}$
and the anisotropy of the superconducting state which would otherwise be
difficult to obtain in a free-standing MoTe$_2$. Our work shows that biaxial
strain is an effective knob to tune the electronic properties of MoTe$_2$. Due
to the simplicity of our methodology to apply biaxial strain, we anticipate its
direct applicability to a wider class of quantum materials.

The existence of bound charge transfer (CT) excitons at the interface of
monolayer lateral heterojunctions has been debated in literature, but contrary
to the case of interlayer excitons in vertical heterostructure their
observation still has to be confirmed. Here, we present a microscopic study
investigating signatures of bound CT excitons in photoluminescence spectra at
the interface of hBN-encapsulated lateral MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructures.
Based on a fully microscopic and material-specific theory, we reveal the
many-particle processes behind the formation of CT excitons and how they can be
tuned via interface- and dielectric engineering. For junction widths smaller
than the Coulomb-induced Bohr radius we predict the appearance of a low-energy
CT exciton. The theoretical prediction is compared with experimental
low-temperature photoluminescence measurements showing emission in the bound CT
excitons energy range. Our joint theory-experiment study presents a significant
step towards a microscopic understanding of optical properties of
technologically promising 2D lateral heterostructures.

The semi-metals having electrons near the Fermi level follow the relativistic
equation of motion, and show Dirac or Weyl-type behavior. Their orbital
resolved electronic bands analysis indicates the non-trivial topological
states. Through the first principle methods, the electronic band structure of
bulk and thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides NiTe2 and PdTe2 are
calculated and analyzed. Implementation of Hubbard corrections to the band
structure indicates zero magnetization, though atoms of Ni are magnetic. Z2
invariant index is calculated for topological classification for both materials
and is found to possess strong topology indicating robust topological surface
states. Further, Fermi surfaces and topological surface states are computed
into kz plane showing the presence of Dirac-fermions by forming of Dirac cone
for PdTe2 but for NiTe2 we do not get clear evidence.

Achieving superconductivity at room temperature is a century-old dream in the
field of physics and materials. Recent discoveries on high-Tc superconductivity
in H3S and LaH10 at high pressure have directed the search for room temperature
superconductors to compressed hydrides with conventional phonon-mediated
superconductivity. Here, we predict an exceptional superhydride ScH12 which has
potential room-temperature superconductivity with a calculated Tc of 313 K at
pressures below one megabar. In contrast to H3S and LaH10, the sublattice of
hydrogen in ScH12 is arranged as quasi-atomic peanut-like units. The emergence
of high Tc is attributed to the van Hove singularities and high phonon
frequencies of quasi-atomic hydrogen. This distinct structure is also found in
MgH12, ZrH12, HfH12 and LuH12, all of which are room temperature
superconductors with the calculated Tc above 300 K. This work provides
innovative direction to experimental search for room temperature
superconductors.

We introduce a variant of dipole representation for composite fermions in a
half-filled Landau level, taking into account the symmetry under exchange of
particles and holes. This is implemented by a special constraint on composite
fermion and composite hole degree of freedom (of an enlarged space), that makes
the resulting composite particle, dipole, a symmetric object. We study an
effective Hamiltonian, that commutes with the constraint on the physical space,
and fulfills the requirement for boost invariance on the Fermi level. The
calculated Fermi liquid parameter F2 is in a good agreement with numerical
investigations in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 147601 (2018)].

We report the magneto-transport measurements of thin film devices of the
topological Weyl semimetal WTe2 with the applied current along and vertical to

WTe2 sandwiched between top and bottom Au electrodes.At low temperatures, we
found a large unsaturated in-plane magnetoresistance and a saturated
out-of-plane magnetoresistance when the external magnetic fields are applied
perpendicular to the plane. By analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, one
oscillation peak is found in the out-of-plane magnetoresistance, in contrast to
four oscillation peaks in the in-plane magnetoresistance.Our work provides new
insight into the origin of the unsaturated magnetoresistance in WTe2 and may

respectively, the `descent' mechanism, where current forms can be seen to have
descended (albeit with occasional modifications) from their roots in ancient
languages, and the `contact' mechanism, where evolution in a given language
occurs via borrowing from other languages with which it is in contact. We use
ideas and concepts from statistical physics to formulate a series of static and
dynamical models which illustrate these issues in general terms. The static
models emphasise the relative numbers of rules and exceptions, while the
dynamical models focus on the emergence of exceptional forms. These unlikely
survivors among various competing grammatical forms are winners against the
odds. Our analysis suggests that they emerge when the influence of neighbouring
languages exceeds the generic tendency towards regularisation within individual
languages.

<h3>Instantaneous normal modes in liquids: a heterogeneous-elastic-medium  approach</h3>

The concept of vibrational density of states in glasses has been mirrored in
liquids by the instantaneous-normal-mode spectrum. While in glasses
instantaneous configurations correspond to minima of the potential-energy
hypersurface and all eigenvalues of the associated Hessian matrix are therefore
positive, in liquids this is no longer true, and modes corresponding to both
positive and negative eigenvalues exist. The instantaneous-normal-mode spectrum
has been numerically investigated in the past, and it has been demonstrated to
bring important information on the liquid dynamics. A systematic deeper
theoretical understanding is now needed. Heterogeneous-elasticity theory has
proven to be successful in explaining many details of the low-frequency
excitations in glasses, ranging from the thoroughly studied boson peak, down to
the more elusive non-phononic excitations observed in numerical simulations at
the lowest frequencies. Here we present an extension of
heterogeneous-elasticity theory to the liquid state, and show that the outcome
of the theory agrees well to the results of extensive molecular-dynamics
simulations of a model liquid at different temperatures. We show that the
spectral shape strongly depends on temperature, being symmetric at high
temperatures and becoming rather asymmetric at low temperatures, close to the
dynamical critical temperature. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the
theory naturally reproduces a surprising phenomenon, a zero-energy spectral
singularity with a cusp-like character developing in the vibrational spectra
upon cooling. This feature, known from a few previous numerical studies, has
been generally overlooked in the past due to a misleading representation of the
data. We provide a thorough analysis of this issue, based on both very accurate
predictions of our theory, and computational studies of model liquid systems
with extended size.

<h3>Probing type-II Ising pairing using the spin-mixing parameter</h3>

<br>
The immunity of the Ising superconductors to external magnetic fields
originates from a spin locking of the paired electrons to an intrinsic
Zeeman-like field. The spin-momentum locking in non-centrosymmetric crystalline
materials leads to type-I Ising pairing in which the direction of the intrinsic
field can be deduced from the spin expectation values. In centrosymmetric
crystals, all the states are spin degenerate due to time reversal symmetry, but
split by the spin-orbit coupling to orbital doublets. The electron spins locked
to the orbitals can form Ising type-II pairs. We present an efficient approach
to determine the direction of the intrinsic field using the spin-mixing
parameter $b^2$. By means of first principles calculations based on the density
functional theory we study monolayer polytype 1T phase transition metal
dichalcogenide superconductors PdTe$_2$, NbTe$_2$ and TiSe$_2$. We calculate
$b^2$ for individual Fermi pockets crossing the Fermi energy and provide a
general picture of possible Ising type-II pairing within the full Brillouin
zone.

<h3>Limitations of the current-phase relation measurements by an asymmetric  dc-SQUID</h3>

Exotic quantum transport phenomena established in Josephson junctions (JJs)
are reflected by a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR). The solidified
approach to measure the CPR is via an asymmetric dc-SQUID with a reference JJ
that has a high critical current. We probed this method by measuring CPRs of
hybrid JJs based on a 3D topological insulator (TI) Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se with a
nanobridge acting as a reference JJ. We captured both highly skewed and
sinusoidal critical current oscillations within single devices which
contradicts the uniqueness of the CPR. This implies that the widely used method
provides inaccurate CPR measurement and leads to misinterpretation. It was
shown that the accuracy of the CPR measurement is mediated by the asymmetry in
derivatives of the CPRs but not in critical currents as was previously thought.
We provided considerations for an accurate CPR measurement that encourage
future experiments with reference CPRs different from those that were used
before.

<br>
<br>
We focused on the transverse AC magneto-conductance of a high mobility
$p$-GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well ($p=1.2\times 10^{11}$~cm$^{-2}$) in the vicinity
of two values of the Landau level filling factor $\nu$: $\nu =1$ (integer
quantum Hall effect) and $\nu =1/3$ (fractional quantum Hall effect). The
complex transverse AC conductance, $\sigma_{xx}^{AC} (\omega)$, was found from
simultaneous measurements of attenuation and velocity of surface acoustic waves
(SAWs) propagating along the interface between a piezoelectric crystal and the
two-dimensional hole system under investigation. We analyzed both the real and
imaginary parts of the hole conductance and compared the similarities and
differences between the results for filling factor 1 and filling factor 1/3.
Both to the left and to the right of these values maxima of a specific shape,
"wings", arose in the $\sigma (\nu)$ dependences at those two $\nu$. Analysis
of the results of our acoustic measurements at different temperatures and
surface acoustic wave frequencies allowed us to attribute these wings to the
formation of collective localized states, namely the domains of a pinned Wigner
crystal, i.e., a Wigner solid. While the Wigner solid has been observed in 2D
hole systems previously, we were able to detect 20 it at the highest hole
density and, therefore, the lowest hole-hole interaction reported.

<h3>Ultrafast entropy production in pump-probe experiments</h3>

The ultrafast control of materials has opened the possibility to investigate
non-equilibrium states of matter with striking properties, provided the sample
of interest can sustain the strong fields often required. Hence, understanding
ultrafast thermodynamic processes within the material are key. While slow
processes lead to quasi-static changes in equilibrium, we focus here on the
opposite limit of extremely short time scales, where the system rapidly
approaches a non-equilibrium regime. Thermodynamic processes under fast driving
were considered before, e.g. in arXiv:2210.11975, but have never been brought
into connection with controlled experiments. Here, we derive a mesoscopic model
for the entropy production due to non-equilibrium phonons excited by a THz
laser pulse. While entropy cannot be measured directly, we show that the
spectral entropy production can be obtained from experimentally observable
quantities, which we illustrate using time-resolved X-ray scattering data for
SrTiO$_3$. Further, we compute the spectral entropy production as a function of
frequency for SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$ for various temperatures. Finally, we
predict that the power spectrum of the displacement-displacement correlation
function exhibits a broad peak besides the eigenmode-resonance, which is
associated with entropy production.

<h3>Inverse Ising effect and Ising magnetoresistance</h3>

Ising (Zeeman-type) spin-orbit coupling (SOC) generated by in-plane inverse
asymmetry has attracted considerable attention, especially in Ising
superconductors and spin-valley coupling physics. However, many unconventional
observations and emerging physical phenomena remain to be elucidated. Here, we
theoretically study the spin texture of {\sigma}_z (spin angular momentum
projection along z) induced by Ising SOC in 1Td WTe2, and propose an
unconventional spin-to-charge conversion named inverse Ising effect, in which
the directions of the spin current, spin polarization and charge current are
not orthogonal. In particular, we predict the Ising magnetoresistance, whose
resistance depends on the out-of-plane magnetic momentum in WTe2/ferromagnetic
heterostructure. The Ising magnetoresistance is believed to be an interesting
counterpart to the well studied spin Hall magnetoresistance. Our predictions
provide promising way to spin-momentum locking and spin-charge conversion based
on emerging Ising SOC.

<h3>The pairing symmetry in quasi-one-dimensional superconductor Rb2Mo3As3</h3>

Quasi-one-dimensional electron systems display intrinsic instability towards
long-range ordered phases at sufficiently low temperatures. The superconducting
orders are of particular interest as they can possess either singlet or triplet
pairing symmetry and frequently compete with magnetism. Here we report on muon
spin rotation and relaxation ($\mathrm{\mu}$SR) study of Rb$_2$Mo$_3$As$_3$
characterised by one of the highest critical temperatures $T_{\rm c}=10.4\
\mathrm{K}$ among quasi-one-dimensional superconductors. The transverse-field
$\mathrm{\mu}$SR signal shows enhanced damping below $T_{\rm c}$ due to the
formation of vortex lattice. Comparison of vortex lattice broadening against
single gap $s-$, $p-$ and $d-$wave models shows the best agreement for the
$s-$wave scenario but with the anomalously small superconducting gap,
$\Delta_0$, to $T_{\rm c}$ ratio of $2\Delta_0/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=2.74(1)$. The
alternative nodal $p-$wave or $d-$wave scenarios with marginally worse goodness
of fit would yield more realistic $2\Delta_0/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=3.50(2)$ and
$2\Delta_0/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=4.08(1)$, respectively, and thus they cannot be
ruled out when accounting for the superconducting state in Rb$_2$Mo$_3$As$_3$.

By means of exact diagonalizations, the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model at
quarter-filling in the limit of strong Hubbard on-site repulsion is
investigated. We find that the non-interacting metallic state will be turned
into a Chern insulator with saturated magnetization under strong correlations.
That is, at such a metal-insulator transition, both the topological and the
magnetic properties of the system are changed due to spontaneous breaking of
time reversal symmetry in the ground states. According to our findings, this
topological phase transition seems to be of first order. Our results illustrate
the interesting physics in topological Mott transitions and provide guidance to
the search of more interaction-induced topological phases in similar systems.

<h3>Nonequilibrium mixture dynamics: A model for mobilities and its  consequences</h3>

<br>
Extending the famous Model B for the time evolution of a liquid mixture, we
derive an approximate expression for the mobility matrix that couples the
different mixture components. This approach is based on a single component
fluid with particles that are artificially grouped into separate species
labelled by ``colors''. The resulting mobility matrix depends on a single
dimensionless parameter, which can be determined efficiently from experimental
data or numerical simulations, and includes existing standard forms as special
cases. We identify two distinct mobility regimes, corresponding to collective
motion and interdiffusion, respectively, and show how they emerge from the
microscopic properties of the fluid. As a test scenario, we study the dynamics
after a thermal quench, providing a number of general relations and analytical
insights from a Gaussian theory. Specifically, for systems with two or three
components, analytical results for the time evolution of the equal time
correlation function compare well to results of Monte Carlo simulations of a
lattice gas. A rich behavior is observed, including the possibility of
transient fractionation.

<h3>Thin cylindrical magnetic nanodots revisited: variational formulation,  accurate solution and phase diagram</h3>

<br>
We investigate the variational formulation and corresponding minimizing
energies for the detection of energetically favorable magnetization states of
thin cylindrical magnetic nanodots. Opposed to frequently used heuristic
procedures found in the literature, we revisit the underlying governing
equations and construct a rigorous variational approach that takes both
exchange and demagnetization energy into account. Based on a combination of
Ritz's method and a Fourier series expansion of the solution field, we are able
to pinpoint the precision of solutions, which are given by vortex modes or
single-domain states, down to an arbitrary degree of precision. Furthermore,
our model allows to derive an expression for the demagnetization energy in
closed form for the in-plane single-domain state, which we compare to results
from the literature. A key outcome of the present investigation is an accurate
phase diagram, which we obtain by comparing the vortex mode's energy minimizers
with those of the single-domain states. This phase diagram is validated with
data of two- and three-dimensional models from literature. By means of the
phase diagram, we particularly find the critical radius at which the vortex
mode becomes unfavorable with machine precision. All relevant data and codes

<br>
The electrostatics of two-dimensional (2D) lateral pn homojunctions
considering the impact of electrostatic doping by means of two split
bottom-gates are studied here. Analytical expressions are obtained from the
solution of the 2D Poisson equation considering a depletion approximation.
Straightforward analytical models for the electrostatic potential and the
depletion width within both the dielectric and the 2D semiconductor are
obtained for both the symmetrical and asymmetrical cases. In contrast to the
case of devices with chemical doping, the obtained depletion width model of
devices with electrostatic doping do not depend on the dielectric constant but
only on the electrostatic potential and oxide thickness. The models describe
the electrostatics of gate-tunable 2D pn junctions at arbitrary bias. A
benchmark against numerical device simulations of MoS2-based pn junctions
validate the analytical models.

Transition Path Theory (TPT) provides a rigorous statistical characterization
of the ensemble of trajectories connecting directly, i.e., without detours, two
disconnected (sets of) states in a Markov chain, a stochastic process that
undergoes transitions from one state to another with probability depending on
the state attained in the previous step. Markov chains can be constructed using
trajectory data via counting of transitions between cells covering the domain
spanned by trajectories. With sparse trajectory data, the use of regular cells
is observed to result in unstable estimates of the total duration of transition
paths. Using Voronoi cells resulting from k-means clustering of the trajectory
data, we obtain stable estimates of this TPT statistic, which is generalized to
frame the remaining duration of transition paths, a new TPT statistic suitable
for investigating connectivity.

<h3>Nonlinear electromagnetic response for Hall effect in time-reversal  breaking materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
It is known that materials with broken time-reversal symmetry can have Hall
responses. Here we show that in addition to the conventional currents, either
linear or nonlinear in the electric field, another Hall current can occur in
the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to
in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is
generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum
origin arising from a novel dipole associated with the Berry curvature and band
velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3
quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory
of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking materials by proposing a new
kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.

We study the momentum distribution of strongly interacting one-dimensional
mixtures of particles at zero temperature in a box potential. We find that the
magnitude of the $1/k^4$ tail of the momentum distribution is not only due to
short-distance correlations, but also to the presence of the rigid walls,
breaking the Tan's relation relating this quantity to the adiabatic derivative
of the energy with respect to the inverse of the interaction strength. The
additional contribution is a finite-size effect that includes a $k$-independent
and an oscillating part. This latter, surprisingly, encodes information on
long-range spin correlations.

A novel dielectric scheme is proposed for strongly coupled electron liquids

provide unprecedently accurate results for the static structure factor with the
exception of the Wigner crystallization vicinity, despite the absence of

Thermal transport is a pivotal probe for studying low-energy, charge-neutral
quasi-particles in insulating magnets. In this Letter, we report an observation
of large magneto-thermal conductivity and thermal Hall effect (THE) in a van
der Waals antiferromagnet FeCl2. The magneto-thermal conductivity reaches over
~700%, indicating strong magnon-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we find an
appreciable thermal Hall signal which changes sign concurrently with the
spin-flip transition from the antiferromagnetic state to the polarized
ferromagnetic state. Our theoretical calculations suggest that, in addition to
the Berry curvature induced at the anticrossing points of the hybridized magnon
and acoustic phonon modes of FeCl2, other mechanisms are needed to account for
the magnitude of the observed THE.

A crucial step for understanding emergent physics of correlated systems is
determining whether a particular model is emergent from ultraviolet physics. So
far, a systematic way of detecting emergent behavior from $\textit{ab initio}$
calculations has yet to be available in the state-of-the-art model derivation
procedures. In this study, we propose that low-energy emergent physics forms
disjoint clusters in an extended descriptor space beyond just energy cutoffs.
Working from highly-accurate many-body quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the
$\textit{ab initio}$ hydrogen chains, we show that a cluster-based
classification algorithm can detect a Heisenberg-like emergent subspace using a
set of descriptors of the energy eigenstates.

Motivated by the experimental identification of a higher-order van Hove
singularity (VHS) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals, we study electronic
instabilities of 2D lattice models with higher-order VHS and flavor degeneracy.
In contrast to conventional VHSs, the larger power-law density of states and
the weaker nesting propensity of higher-order VHSs conspire together to
generate distinct competing instabilities. After discussing the occurrence of
higher-order VHSs on square and kagome lattice models, we perform unbiased
renormalization group calculations to study competing instabilities and find a
rich phase diagram containing ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetism,
superconductivity and Pomeranchuk orders. Remarkably, there is a generic
transition from superconductivity to a $d$-wave Pomeranchuk order with
increasing flavor number. Implications for the intriguing quantum states of
AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals are also discussed.

Single-file diffusion refers to the motion of diffusive particles in narrow
channels, so that they cannot bypass each other. This constraint leads to the
subdiffusion of a tagged particle, called the tracer. This anomalous behaviour
results from the strong correlations that arise in this geometry between the
tracer and the surrounding bath particles. Despite their importance, these
bath-tracer correlations have long remained elusive, because their
determination is a complex many-body problem. Recently, we have shown that, for
several paradigmatic models of single-file diffusion such as the Simple
Exclusion Process, these bath-tracer correlations obey a simple exact closed
equation. In this paper, we provide the full derivation of this equation, as
well as an extension to another model of single-file transport: the double
exclusion process. We also make the connection between our results and the ones
obtained very recently by several other groups, and which rely on the exact
solution of different models obtained by the inverse scattering method.

We introduce a simple model of diffusive jump process where a fee is charged
for each jump. The nonlinear cost function is such that slow jumps incur a flat
fee, while for fast jumps the cost is proportional to the velocity of the jump.
The model -- inspired by the way taxi meters work -- exhibits a very rich
behavior. The cost for trajectories of equal length and equal duration exhibits
giant fluctuations at a critical value of the scaled distance travelled.
Furthermore, the full distribution of the cost until the target is reached
exhibits an interesting ``freezing'' transition in the large-deviation regime.
All the analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations, and wider
applications of this general model are discussed.

We propose a passive single-photon detector based on the bipolar
thermoelectric effect occurring in tunnel junctions between two different
superconductors thanks to spontaneous electron-hole symmetry breaking. Our
thermoelectric detector (TED) converts a finite temperature difference caused
by the absorption of a single photon into an open circuit thermovoltage.
Designed with feasible parameters, our TED is able to reveal single-photons of
frequency ranging from about 15 GHz to about 150 PHz depending on the chosen
design and materials. In particular, this detector is expected to show values
of signal-to-noise ratio SNR about 15 at {\nu} = 50 GHz when operated at a
temperature of 10 mK. Interestingly, this device can be viewed as a digital
single-photon detector, since it generates an almost constant voltage VS for
the full operation energies. Our TED can reveal single photons in a frequency
range wider than 4 decades with the possibility to discern the energy of the
incident photon by measuring the time persistence of the generated
thermovoltage. Its broadband operation suggests that our TED could find
practical applications in several fields of quantum science and technology,
such as quantum computing, telecommunications, optoelectronics, THz
spectroscopy and astro-particle physics.

Fluoride salts are prospective materials for applications in some next
generation nuclear reactors and their thermophysical properties at various
conditions are of interest. Experimental measurement of the properties of these
salts is often difficult and, in some cases, unfeasible due to challenges from
high temperatures, impurity control, and corrosivity. Therefore, accurate
theoretical methods are needed for fluoride salt property prediction. In this
work, we used moment tensor potentials (MTP) to approximate the potential
energy surface of eutectic FLiBe (0.66 LiF 0.33 BeF2) predicted by the ab
initio (DFT D3) method. We then used the developed potential and molecular
dynamics to obtain several thermophysical properties of FLiBe, including radial
distribution functions, density, self-diffusion coefficients, thermal
expansion, specific heat capacity, bulk modulus, viscosity, and thermal
conductivity. Our results show that the MTP potential approximates the
potential energy surface accurately and the overall approach yields very good
agreement with experimental values. The converged fitting can be obtained with
less than 600 configurations generated from DFT calculations, which data can be
generated in just 1200 core hours on today's typical processors. The MTP
potential is faster than many machine learning potentials and about one order
of magnitude slower than widely used empirical molten salt potentials such as
Tosi Fumi.

We present a comparison between various algorithms of inference of covariance
and precision matrices in small datasets of real vectors, of the typical length
and dimension of human brain activity time series retrieved by functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Assuming a Gaussian model underlying the
neural activity, the problem consists in denoising the empirically observed
matrices in order to obtain a better estimator of the true precision and
covariance matrices. We consider several standard noise-cleaning algorithms and
compare them on two types of datasets. The first type are time series of fMRI
brain activity of human subjects at rest. The second type are synthetic time
series sampled from a generative Gaussian model of which we can vary the
fraction of dimensions per sample q = N/T and the strength of off-diagonal
correlations. The reliability of each algorithm is assessed in terms of
test-set likelihood and, in the case of synthetic data, of the distance from
the true precision matrix. We observe that the so called Optimal Rotationally
Invariant Estimator, based on Random Matrix Theory, leads to a significantly
lower distance from the true precision matrix in synthetic data, and higher
test likelihood in natural fMRI data. We propose a variant of the Optimal
Rotationally Invariant Estimator in which one of its parameters is optimised by
cross-validation. In the severe undersampling regime (large q) typical of fMRI
series, it outperforms all the other estimators. We furthermore propose a
simple algorithm based on an iterative likelihood gradient ascent, providing an
accurate estimation for weakly correlated datasets.

We prove a few spectral theorems for the density of states of a Weyl node
with arbitrary topology. We show that the density of extended states of a Weyl
node with random impurity potentials remains gapless in the presence of a
magnetic field. Therefore, a magnetic field precludes Anderson localization in
Weyl semi-metals, when inter-node transitions are suppressed for smooth enough
potentials. We also provide a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the chiral
magnetic effect for arbitrary topology of a Weyl node.

In low dimensions, the combined effects of interactions and quantum
fluctuations can lead to dramatically new physics distinct from that existing
in higher dimensions. Here, we investigate the electronic and optical
properties of CeIr$_{3}$B$_{2}$, a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Kondo lattice
system, using $ab\ initio$ calculations. The Ce atoms in the hexagonal crystal
structure form 1D chains along the $c$-axis, with extremely short Ce-Ce
distances. The quasi-1D nature of the crystal structure is well reflected in
its electronic structure. Extremely flat bands emerge within the $ab$-plane of
the Brillouin zone, yielding sharp optical transitions in the corresponding
optical conductivity. Our calculations indicate that these prominent peaks in
the optical conductivity provide a clear signature of quasi-1D heavy fermion
systems.

<h3>Non-equilibrium steady-states and critical slowing down in the  dissipative Bose-Hubbard model</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experiments, we study the properties of large
Bose-Hubbard chains with single-particle losses at one site using classical
field methods. We construct and validate a compact effective model that reduces
computations to only a few sites. We show that in the mean-field approach the
description captures the stationary states of the dissipative mode very well.
Not only is there a good quantitative agreement in the hysteresis loop, the
dark soliton state can be reproduced as well due to the the preservation of the
$U(1)$ symmetry. Bimodality of the steady states, observed on longer
timescales, is studied using the truncated Wigner method. We compare the
switching statistics and derive the effective Liouvillian gap in function of
the tunneling, showing that the effective description underestimates
fluctuations.

<h3>Atom-number enhancement by shielding atoms from losses in strontium  magneto-optical traps</h3>

We present a scheme to enhance the atom number in magneto-optical traps of
strontium atoms operating on the 461 nm transition. This scheme consists of
resonantly driving the $^1$S$_0\to^3$P$_1$ intercombination line at 689 nm,
which continuously populates a short-lived reservoir state and, as expected
from a theoretical model, partially shields the atomic cloud from losses
arising in the 461 nm cooling cycle. We show a factor of two enhancement in the
atom number for the bosonic isotopes $^{88}$Sr and $^{84}$Sr, and the fermionic
isotope $^{87}$Sr, in good agreement with our model. Our scheme can be applied
in the majority of strontium experiments without increasing the experimental
complexity of the apparatus, since the employed 689 nm transition is commonly
used for further cooling. Our method should thus be beneficial to a broad range
of quantum science and technology applications exploiting cold strontium atoms,
and could be extended to other atomic species.

<h3>Moment generating function bound from detailed fluctuation theorem</h3>

A famous consequence of the detailed fluctuation theorem (FT),
$p(\Sigma)/p(-\Sigma)=\exp{(\Sigma)}$, is the integral FT $\langle
\exp(-\Sigma)\rangle =1$ for a random variable $\Sigma$ and a distribution
$p(\Sigma)$. When $\Sigma$ represents the entropy production in thermodynamics,
the main outcome of the integral FT is the second law, $\langle \Sigma \rangle
\geq 0$. However, a full description of the fluctuations of $\Sigma$ might
require knowledge of the moment generating function (MGF), $G(\alpha):=\langle
\exp(\alpha \Sigma) \rangle$. In the context of the detailed FT, we show the
MGF is lower bounded in the form $G(\alpha)\geq B(\alpha,\langle\Sigma\rangle)$
for a given mean $\langle\Sigma\rangle$. As applications, we verify that the
bound is satisfied for the entropy produced in the heat exchange problem
between two reservoirs mediated by a weakly coupled bosonic mode and a qubit
swap engine.

For families of Hamiltonians defined by parts that are local, the most
general definition of a symmetry algebra is the commutant algebra, i.e., the
algebra of operators that commute with each local part. Thinking about symmetry
algebras as commutant algebras allows for the treatment of conventional
symmetries and unconventional symmetries (e.g., those responsible for weak
ergodicity breaking phenomena) on equal algebraic footing. In this work, we
discuss two methods for numerically constructing this commutant algebra
starting from a family of Hamiltonians. First, we use the equivalence of this
problem to that of simultaneous block-diagonalization of a given set of local
operators, and discuss a probabilistic method that has been found to work with
probability 1 for both Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries or commutant
algebras. Second, we map this problem onto the problem of determining
frustration-free ground states of certain Hamiltonians, and we use ideas from
tensor network algorithms to efficiently solve this problem in one dimension.
These numerical methods are useful in detecting standard and non-standard
conserved quantities in families of Hamiltonians, which includes examples of
regular symmetries, Hilbert space fragmentation, and quantum many-body scars,
and we show many such examples. In addition, they are necessary for verifying
several conjectures on the structure of the commutant algebras in these cases,
which we have put forward in earlier works. Finally, we also discuss similar
methods for the inverse problem of determining local operators with a given
symmetry or commutant algebra, which connects to existing methods in the
literature.
