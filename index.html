<h3>Hydrodynamically Induced Aggregation in Two-Dimensional Active Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13851</a>
<br>
<i>Roee Bashan, Naomi Oppenheimer</i>
<p>We investigate a system of co-oriented active particles interacting only via
hydrodynamic and steric interactions. We offer a new method of calculating the
flow created by any active particle in a 2D fluid, focusing on the dynamics of
flow fields with a high-order spatial decay, which we analyze using a geometric
Hamiltonian. We show that when orientational degrees of freedom are quenched,
and the flow has a single, odd power decay, such many-particle systems lead to
stable, fractal-like aggregation, with the only exceptions being the force
dipole. We discuss how our results can easily be generalized to more
complicated force distributions and to other effective two-dimensional systems.

<h3>Fluctuations, correlations, and Casimir-like forces in the homogeneous  cooling state of a granular gas</h3>

<p>The fluctuating hydrodynamics by Brey et. al. is analytically solved to get
the long-time limit of the fluctuations of the number density, velocity field,
and energy density around the homogeneous cooling state of a granular gas,
under physical conditions where it keeps stable. Explicit expressions are given
for the non-white contributions in the elastic limit. For small dissipation,
the latter is shown to be much smaller than the inelastic contributions, in
general. The fluctuation-induced Casimir-like forces on the walls of the system
are calculated assuming a fluctuating pressure tensor resulting from perturbing
its Navier-Stokes expression. This way, the Casimir-like forces emerges as the
correlation between the longitudinal velocity and the energy density.
Interestingly, the fluctuation-induced forces push/pull the system towards the
square or rectangular geometry when they vanish, in good agreement with the
event-driven numerical simulations.

<h3>Emergent chiral metal near a Kondo breakdown quantum phase transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13641</a>
<br>
<i>Tom Drechsler, Matthias Vojta</i>
<p>The destruction of the Kondo effect in a local-moment metal can lead to a
topological non-Fermi-liquid phase, dubbed fractionalized Fermi liquid, with
spinon-type excitations and an emergent gauge field. We demonstrate that, if
the latter displays an internal $\pi$-flux structure, a chiral heavy-fermion
metal naturally emerges near the Kondo-breakdown transition. Utilizing a parton
mean-field theory describing the transition between a conventional heavy Fermi
liquid and a U(1) fractionalized Fermi liquid, we find a novel intermediate
phase near the transition whose emergent flux pattern spontaneously breaks both
translation and time-reversal symmetries. This phase is an orbital
antiferromagnet, and we discuss its relevance to pertinent experiments.

<h3>The layered RuBr$_3$-RuI$_3$ honeycomb system</h3>

<p>The layered RuBr3-RuI3 honeycomb system was synthesized at high-pressures.
The crystal structures are centrosymmetric (space group R-3), and based on
honeycomb layers of Ru$^{3+}$ (S=1/2). Their basic physical properties are
surveyed. The solid solution switches from insulating to metallic in the range
of concentrations between RuBr$_{0.75}$I$_{2.25}$ and RuBr$_{0.50}$I$_{2.50}$.
A preliminary structure/property phase diagram is presented. Our results
suggest that this solid solution may provide insight into the influence of
disorder on spin-orbit-coupled quantum spin liquids.

<h3>Electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in R$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$ nickel  oxides</h3>

<i>Alvaro Adrian Carrasco Alvarez, Sebastien Petit, Lucia Iglesias, Manuel Bibes, Wilfrid Prellier, Julien Varignon</i>
<p>Nickel oxide superconductors offer an alternative playground for
understanding the formation of Cooper pairs in correlated materials such as the
famous cuprates. By studying the La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ phase diagram on
the basis of hybrid and spin-polarized density functional theory simulations,
we reveal the existence of charge and bond ordered (CBO) insulating phases that
are quenched by doping effects, ultimately resulting in a metallic phase at the
$n=5$ member. Nevertheless, the phonons associated with the CBO identified in
the phase diagram remain sufficiently large to mediate Cooper pairs in
La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$, yielding a computed critical temperature between
$T_c=11-19$ K consistent with the 13 K observed experimentally in
Nd$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$. Thus, in order to identify the superconducting mechanism,
extracting the relevant instabilities in the doping phase diagram of
superconductors appears critical.

<h3>Triphenylamine-based interlayer with carboxyl anchoring group for tuning  of charge collection interface in stabilized p-i-n perovskite solar cells and  modules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13685</a>

<i>P.K. Sukhorukova, E.A. Ilicheva, P.A. Gostishchev, L.O. Luchnikov, M.M. Tepliakova, D.O. Balakirev, I.V. Dyadishchev, A.A. Vasilev, D.S. Muratov, Yu. N. Luponosov, A. Di Carlo, D.S. Saranin</i>
<p>A novel triphenylamine-based hole transport material (HTM) with a carboxyl
anchoring group (TPATC) was developed for tuning the interface between
nanocrystalline NiO and double cation CsCH3(NH2)2PbI3-xClx absorber in p-i-n
device architectures. We present a unique comprehensive confinement study of
PSCs with TPATC as the self-assembled HTM, including analysis of numerical
defect parameters, phase composition evolution, and up-scaling capabilities.
Our investigation shows that the ultrathin TPATC interlayer effectively
passivates traps, increases work-function of HTL by about ~0.2 eV, and enhances
the charge carrier extraction efficiency. Advanced transient spectroscopy
measurements revealed that modification of the NiO surface with TPATC in
perovskite solar cells (PSCs) reduces the concentration of ionic defects by an
order of magnitude. Interface engineering with TPATC allowed to reach power
conversion efficiency of 20.58% for small area devices (0.15 cm2) under
standard AM 1.5 G conditions. Using TPATC interlayer also provided stabilized
performance of PSCs under operation conditions and improved sustainability of
the perovskite absorber to decomposition. After continuous light-soaking (1000
h, ISOS-L-2 protocol), NiO/TPATC devices showed a slight decrease of 2% in
maximum power. In contrast, NiO PSCs demonstrated decrease in power output
(>20%) after 400 h. We explored the potential of TPATC to modify interfaces in
large-area perovskite solar modules (PSM, active area-64.8 cm2, 12 sub-cells).
By applying slot-die-coated TPATC, the PCE at AM 1.5 G conditions increased
from 13.22% for NiO PSM to 15.64% for NiO/TPATC ones. This study provides new
insights into the interface engineering for p-i-n perovskite solar cells,
behavior of the ionic defects and their contribution to the long-term
stability.

<h3>Fractional Quantum Hall State at Filling Factor $ν=1/4$ in  Ultra-High-Quality GaAs 2D Hole Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13689" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13689</a>
<br>
<i>Chengyu Wang, A. Gupta, S. K. Singh, P. T. Madathil, Y. J. Chung, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. Baldwin, R. Winkler, M. Shayegan</i>
<p>Single-component fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) at even-denominator
filling factors may host non-Abelian quasiparticles that are considered to be
building blocks of topological quantum computers. Such states, however, are
rarely observed in the lowest-energy Landau level, namely at filling factors
$\nu<1$. Here we report evidence for an even-denominator FQHS at $\nu=1/4$ in
ultra-high-quality two-dimensional hole systems confined to modulation-doped
GaAs quantum wells. We observe a deep minimum in the longitudinal resistance at
$\nu=1/4$, superimposed on a highly insulating background, suggesting a close
competition between the $\nu=1/4$ FQHS and the magnetic-field-induced, pinned
Wigner solid states. Our experimental observations are consistent with the very
recent theoretical calculations which predict that substantial Landau level
mixing, caused by the large hole effective mass, can induce composite fermion
pairing and lead to a non-Abelian FQHS at $\nu=1/4$. Our results demonstrate
that Landau level mixing can provide a very potent means for tuning the
interaction between composite fermions and creating new non-Abelian FQHSs.

<h3>Controlling selection rules for magnon scattering in nanomagnets by  spatial symmetry breaking</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13726</a>
<br>
<i>Arezoo Etesamirad, Julia Kharlan, Rodolfo Rodriguez, Igor Barsukov, Roman Verba</i>
<p>Nanomagnets are the building blocks of many existing and emergent spintronic
technologies. Magnetization dynamics of nanomagnets is often dominated by
nonlinear processes, which have been recently shown to have many surprising
features and far-reaching implications for applications. Here we develop a
theoretical framework uncovering the selection rules for multimagnon processes
and discuss their underlying mechanisms. For its technological relevance, we
focus on the degenerate three-magnon process in thin elliptical nanodisks to
illustrate our findings. We parameterize the selection rules through a set of
magnon interaction coefficients which we calculate using micromagnetic
simulations. We postulate the selection rules and investigate how they are
altered by perturbations, that break the symmetry of static magnetization
configuration and spatial spin-wave profiles and that can be realized by
applying off-symmetry-axis or nonuniform magnetic fields. Our work provides the
phenomenological understanding into the mechanics of magnon interaction as well
as the formalism for determining the interaction coefficients from simulations
and experimental data. Our results serve as a guide to analyze magnon processes
inherently present in spin-torque devices for boosting their performance or to
engineer a specific nonlinear response of a nanomagnet used in neuromorphic or
quantum magnonic application.

<h3>Nonrelaxational FMR peak broadening in spatially inhomogeneous films</h3>

<br>
<i>Victor A. L'vov, Julia Kharlan, Vladimir O. Golub</i>
<p>The modification of magnetic properties in spatially inhomogeneous epitaxial
films of magnetic shape memory alloys in martensitic state with the temperature
variation has been studied. The proposed theoretical model is based on Landau
theory of martensitic transformation and statistical model of martensitic
state. It was shown that that spatial inhomogeneity of the material leads to
the dispersion of local martensitic transformation temperatures resulting in
the variation of local magnetic anisotropy values. This model allows describing
the dramatic ferromagnetic resonance line broadening observed in the
experiments in epitaxial films of magnetic shape memory alloys at low
temperatures.

<h3>On Principles of Emergent Organization</h3>

<br>
<i>Adam T. Rupe, James P. Crutchfield</i>
<p>After more than a century of concerted effort, physics still lacks basic
principles of spontaneous self-organization. To appreciate why, we first state
the problem, outline historical approaches, and survey the present state of the
physics of self-organization. This frames the particular challenges arising
from mathematical intractability and the resulting need for computational
approaches, as well as those arising from a chronic failure to define
structure. Then, an overview of two modern mathematical formulations of
organization -- intrinsic computation and evolution operators -- lays out a way
to overcome these challenges. Together, the vantage point they afford shows how
to account for the emergence of structured states via a statistical mechanics
of systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium. The result is a constructive path
forward to principles of organization that builds on mathematical
identification of structure.

<h3>The valleytronic topological filters in silicene-like inner-edge systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13758" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13758</a>
<br>
<i>Hang Xie, Xiao-Long Lü, Jia-En Yang</i>
<p>Inner edge state with spin and valley degrees of freedom is a promising
candidate to design a dissipationless device due to the topological protection.
The central challenge for the application of inner edge state is to generate
and modulate the polarized currents. In this work, we discover a new mechanism
to generate fully valley- and spin-valley-polarized current caused by the Bloch
wavevector mismatch (BWM). Based on this mechanism, we design some serial-typed
inner-edge filters. With once of the BWM, the coincident states could be
divided into transmitted and reflected modes, which can serve as a valley or
spin-valley filter. In particular, while with twice of the BWM, the incident
current is absolutely reflected to support an off state with a specified valley
and spin, which is different from the gap effect. These findings give rise to a
new platform for designing valleytronics and spin-valleytronics.

<h3>B63: the most stable bilayer structure with dual aromaticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13772</a>
<br>
<i>Jinhuang Chen, Rui Liao, Linwei Sai, Xue Wu, Jijun Zhao</i>
<p>The emergence of the first bilayer B48, which has been both theoretically
predicted and experimentally observed, as well as the recent experimental
synthesis of bilayer borophene on Ag and Cu, has generated tremendous curiosity
in the bilayer structure of boron clusters. However, the connection between the
bilayer cluster and the bilayer borophene remains unknown. By combining a
genetic algorithm and density functional theory calculations, a global search
for the low-energy structures of B63 clusters was conducted, revealing that the
Cs bilayer structure with three interlayer B-B bonds was the most stable
bilayer structure. This structure was further examined in terms of its
structural stability, chemical bonding, and aromaticity. Interestingly, the
interlayer bonds exhibited electronegativity and robust aromaticity.
Furthermore, the double aromaticity stemmed from diatropic currents originating
from virtual translational transitions at both the sigma and pi electrons. This
new boron bilayer is anticipated to enrich the concept of double aromaticity
and serve as a valuable precursor for bilayer borophene.

<h3>Dynamics and rheology of 2D colloidal crystals with active anisotropic  impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13773" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13773</a>
<br>
<i>Jacob John, Giovanniantonio Natale</i>
<p>Active motion at complex fluid-fluid interfaces is a ubiquitous phenomenon in
nature. However, an intriguing question that is not fully addressed is how
active motion affects and gets influenced by its complex environment. Here, we
design a 2D colloidal crystal containing active particles as a model system to
understand the mechanics of complex interfaces in the presence of activity. We
characterize the dynamics, rheology and phase behavior of 2D colloidal crystals
formed using spherical polystyrene (PS) particles in the presence of active
PS-Platinum Janus particles. In the presence of activity, the overall crystal
becomes dynamic with a heterogeneous spatial distribution of disorder. Through
particle-tracking microrheology and interfacial shear rheology, we report the
discovery of a phase transition from solid-like to liquid-like interface driven
by the active motion of a small number of active impurities in the crystal. The
local perturbations induced by the active impurities have long-range effects on
the dynamics of particles in 2D colloidal crystals modifying their overall
viscoelasticity. The correlations between microstructure and dynamics from our
experiments can provide insights into the behavior of a broad range of complex
systems such as, motion of particles at oil-water interfaces in Pickering
emulsion microreactors and the motion of molecular motors on cell membranes.

<h3>Accurate Prediction of Experimental Band Gaps from Large Language  Model-Based Data Extraction</h3>

<br>
<i>Samuel J. Yang, Shutong Li, Subhashini Venugopalan, Vahe Tshitoyan, Muratahan Aykol, Amil Merchant, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, Gowoon Cheon</i>
<p>Machine learning is transforming materials discovery by providing rapid
predictions of material properties, which enables large-scale screening for
target materials. However, such models require training data. While automated
data extraction from scientific literature has potential, current
auto-generated datasets often lack sufficient accuracy and critical structural
and processing details of materials that influence the properties. Using band
gap as an example, we demonstrate Large language model (LLM)-prompt-based
extraction yields an order of magnitude lower error rate. Combined with
additional prompts to select a subset of experimentally measured properties
from pure, single-crystalline bulk materials, this results in an automatically
extracted dataset that's larger and more diverse than the largest existing
human-curated database of experimental band gaps. Compared to the existing
human-curated database, we show the model trained on our extracted database
achieves a 19% reduction in the mean absolute error of predicted band gaps.
Finally, we demonstrate that LLMs are able to train models predicting band gap
on the extracted data, achieving an automated pipeline of data extraction to
materials property prediction.

<br>
<i>Hao Lyu, Yuanyuan Chen, Qizhong Zhu, Yongping Zhang</i>
<p>One of brilliant achievements in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates
is the discovery and observation of the supersolid stripe states. So far, all
studied supersolid stripe states do not carry supercurrent. In this work, we
reveal the existence of novel supercurrent-carrying supersolids in
spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. The supersolid family has a
parabolic-like dispersion relation and carries supercurrent which is
proportional to the quasimomentum. Energetic and dynamical instabilities can
break supercurrent-carrying ability of this supersolid family. An insightful
interpretation of the dynamical instability of supercurrent-carrying
supersolids from the pure plane-wave phase is provided.

<br>
<i>Alexei Goun</i>
<p>A novel technique for studying the demixing of binary fluids with nanosecond
time resolution at nanometer spatial resolution is demonstrated. Nanosecond
kinetics of phase separation initial stages in the water/2,6-lutidine mixture
studied through the combination of a laser-induced temperature jump, and
Forster Resonant Excitation Transfer techniques. A pair of chromophores:
8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate (HPTS) and Coumarin 480 form a FRET pair in
the uniform phase of the mixture and separate into the components of the
mixture in the nonuniform phase. The temperature jump that brings the mixture
into a nonuniform phase is performed by the mid-infrared laser pulse. The
exponential growth stage of phase separation is in the 5 to 20 nanoseconds
range. The demonstrated technique can be applied to a broad range of chemical
and biological systems.

<h3>Neural Network Thermodynamics</h3>

<i>D. Wagner, A. Klümper, J. Sirker</i>
<p>We present three different neural network algorithms to calculate
thermodynamic properties as well as dynamic correlation functions at finite
temperatures for quantum lattice models. The first method is based on
purification, which allows for the exact calculation of the operator trace. The
second one is based on a sampling of the trace using minimally entangled
states, whereas the third one makes use of quantum typicality. In the latter
case, we approximate a typical infinite-temperature state by wave functions
which are given by a product of a projected pair and a neural network part and
evolve this typical state in imaginary time.

<h3>GHz operation of a quantum point contact using stub impedance matching  circuit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13804" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13804</a>
<br>
<i>Anusha Shanmugam, Prasanta Kumbhakar, Harikrishnan Sundaresan, Annu Anns Sunny, J L Reno, Madhu Thalakulam</i>
<p>Quantum point contacts (QPC) are the building blocks of quantum dot qubits
and semiconducting quantum electrical metrology circuits. QPCs also make highly
sensitive electrical amplifiers with the potential to operate in the
quantum-limited regime. Though the inherent operational bandwidth of QPCs can
eclipse the THz regime, the impedance mismatch with the external circuitry
limits the operation to a few kHz regimes. Lumped-element impedance-matching
circuits are successful only up to a few hundreds of MHz. QPCs are
characterised by a complex impedance consisting of quantized resistance,
capacitance, and inductance elements. Characterising the complex admittance at
higher frequencies and understanding the coupling of QPC to other circuit
elements and electromagnetic environments will provide valuable insight into
its sensing and backaction properties. In this work, we couple a QPC
galvanically to a superconducting stub tuner impedance matching circuit
realised in a coplanar waveguide architecture to enhance the operation
frequency into the GHz regime and investigate the electrical amplification and
complex admittance characteristics. The device, operating at 1.96 GHz exhibits
a conductance sensitivity of 29.2 micro-e/SQRT(Hz) and a bandwidth of 13MHz.
Besides, the RF reflected power unambiguously reveals the complex admittance
characteristics of the QPC, shining more light on the behaviour of quantum
tunnel junctions at higher operational frequencies.

<i>Mohamed Bilal Shakeel, Samir Brahim Belhaouari, Fedwa El Mellouhi</i>
<p>In the field of materials science, comprehending material properties is often
hindered by the complexity of datasets originating from various sources. This
study introduces the Automated Model Training (AMT) Graphical User Interface
(GUI), specifically crafted for the use of researchers and scientists without a
programming background to design the next set of experiments either in a
chemistry lab or on the computer. The GUI integrates diverse machine learning
models, such as XG-Boost, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Linear
Regression, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Stack Regressors, offering a
robust toolkit for data analysis. It facilitates the exploration of complex
relationships, non-linear patterns, and predictive accuracy optimization. To
further enhance its utility, the GUI integrates the Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) technique, allowing researchers to systematically explore vast parameter
spaces and identify optimal experimental conditions. This synergy between
machine learning and PSO empowers material scientists through a user-friendly
platform for data-driven discovery. The AMT GUI bridges the gap between
traditional experimentation and machine learning, enabling precise and
efficient exploration of the materials research space.

<h3>Mechanical Characterization and Inverse Design of Stochastic Architected  Metamaterials Using Neural Operators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13812" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13812</a>
<br>
<i>Hanxun Jin, Enrui Zhang, Boyu Zhang, Sridhar Krishnaswamy, George Em Karniadakis, Horacio D. Espinosa</i>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of
architected materials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable
through lab-based trial-and-error methods. However, a major challenge in
current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational
and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for
designing micro-scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear
mechanical behaviors. Here, we introduce a new end-to-end scientific ML
framework, leveraging deep neural operators (DeepONet), to directly learn the
relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of
architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental
data. The approach facilitates the inverse design of structures tailored to
specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from spinodal
microstructures, printed using two-photon lithography, reveal that the
prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 - 10%. Our
work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced
micro-mechanics experimental techniques, the design of complex
micro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity. Our work marks a significant
advancement in the field of materials-by-design, potentially heralding a new
era in the discovery and development of next-generation metamaterials with
unparalleled mechanical characteristics derived directly from experimental
insights.

<h3>Effect of multi-layering and crystal orientation on spin-orbit torque  efficiency in Ni/Pt layer stacking</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13835</a>
<br>
<i>A. Sud, Y.-C. Lau, J. Brierley, H. Kurebayashi, T. Seki</i>
<p>We study spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in Ni/Pt bi-layers and multi-layers by
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and harmonic-Hall measurements. The effect of
multi-layering and crystal orientation on field-like (FL) and damping-like (DL)
torque efficiencies is examined by exploiting the samples with different
crystal orientations: epitaxial and poly-crystalline structures on Sapphire and
SiO$_2$ substrates, respectively.
We find that both DL and FL torque efficiencies are larger in multi-layer
samples and there is no complete cancellation of torque efficiencies that is
generally expected for ideal symmetric stacking structures. The results of
SOT-FMR indicate that the epitaxial samples show higher efficiency for SOT
generation compared to the poly-crystalline samples, suggesting that SOT
generation is modified depending on the interfacial contribution. In addition,
the spin Hall conductivity of the epitaxial multi-layer is the largest among
the samples. The present results signify the importance of crystal orientation,
multi-layering and interface-quality in improving the efficiency of SOTs
generation combined with larger spin hall angle for developing future
spintronic devices.

<h3>Rate- and temperature-dependent ductile-to-brittle fracture transition:  Experimental investigation and phase-field analysis for toffee</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13869" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13869</a>
<br>
<i>Franz Dammaß, Dennis Schab, Harald Rohm, Markus Kästner</i>
<p>The mechanical behaviour of many materials, including polymers or natural
materials, significantly depends on the rate of deformation. As a consequence,
a rate-dependent ductile-to-brittle fracture transition may be observed. For
toffee-like caramel, this effect is particularly pronounced. At room
temperature, this confectionery may be extensively deformed at low strain
rates, while it can behave highly brittle when the rate of deformation is
raised. Likewise, the material behaviour does significantly depend on
temperature, and even a slight cooling may cause a significant embrittlement.
In this work, a thorough experimental investigation of the rate-dependent
deformation and fracture behaviour is presented. In addition, the influence of
temperature on the material response is studied. The experimental results form
the basis for a phase-field modelling of fracture. In order to derive the
governing equations of the model, an incremental variational principle is
introduced. By means of the validated model, an analysis of the experimentally
observed ductile-to-brittle fracture transition is performed. In particular,
the coupling between the highly dissipative deformation behaviour of the bulk
material and the rate-dependent fracture resistance is discussed.

<h3>Antimony Doping Effect on the Superconducting Properties of SmFeAs(O,F)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13908</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammad Azam, Manasa Manasa, Tatiana Zajarniuk, Ryszard Diduszko, Tomasz Cetner, Andrzej Morawski, Andrzej Wisniewski, Shiv J. Singh</i>
<p>We report the synthesis and characterization of a series of antimony-doped
SmFeAs1-xSbxO0.8F0.2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) bulks to
investigate the twin doping effects on the superconducting properties of
SmFeAs(O,F) caused by fluorine (F) incorporation at O-site in SmO layer and
antimony (Sb) substitution at As-site in the conducting layer (FeAs). Since the
antimony (Sb) has a larger size than arsenic (As), the enhancement of lattice
parameters has been confirmed by the XRD analysis. Microstructural analysis
confirms that Sb-doping leads to a small improvement in the sample density and
an increase in the inhomogeneity of the constituent elements, especially at
higher Sb-doping levels. The parent compound SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 has shown the
superconducting transition (Tc) at ~54 K, which is systematically reduced with
the antimony doping contents (x). Our investigation indicates that the Sb-doped
SmFeAs(O,F) phase at low levels is less prone to the multiphase formation than
at high levels, which affects the inter- and intragranular behaviour
originating from the microstructure nature of 1111 bulks. The critical current
density (Jc) of the parent compound has almost the same value as previously
reported, which is suppressed slowly with increased Sb-doping. It could be due
to the reduced grain connections and the effective pinning centers. This study
confirms that the superconducting FeAs layer doping with larger ions at arsenic
sites does not support the superconducting properties of Sm1111, which is a
distinct behavior from that of Sb-doped CeFeAs(O,F) and LaFeAs(O,F).

<h3>First passage times in compact domains exhibits bi-scaling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13915</a>
<br>
<i>Talia Baravi, Eli Barkai</i>
<p>The study of first passage times for diffusing particles reaching target
states is foundational in various practical applications, including
diffusion-controlled reactions. In this work, we present a bi-scaling theory
for the probability density function of first passage times in confined compact
processes, applicable to both Euclidean and Fractal domains, diverse
geometries, and scenarios with or without external force fields, accommodating
Markovian and semi-Markovian random walks. In large systems, first passage time
statistics exhibit a bi-scaling behavior, challenging the use of a single time
scale. Our theory employs two distinct scaling functions: one for short times,
capturing initial dynamics in unbounded systems, and the other for long times
is sensitive to finite size effects. The combined framework provides a complete
expression for first passage time statistics across all time scales.

<h3>Effect of dephasing on the current through a periodically driven quantum  point contact</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13918</a>
<br>
<i>Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy</i>
<p>We consider two one-dimensional quantum $XX$ magnets linked by a periodically
driven quantum point contact (QPC). If magnets are initially polarized in
opposite directions, one expects that a spin current through the QPC will
establish. It has been shown recently [Phys. Rev. B 103, L041405 (2021)] that,
in fact, when the driving frequency exceeds a critical value, the current halts
completely, the QPC being effectively insulating. Here we enquire how this
picture is affected by quantum dephasing. Our findings reveal that any non-zero
dephasing restores the current.

<p>We investigate the topological characteristics of a recently discovered class
of semimetals in two dimensions on the honeycomb lattice. These semimetals
reside at the transition between two distinct topological insulators, each
existing in a nontrivial topological phase. As a result, these semimetals
exhibit specific topological properties, including the presence of edge modes.
In a preceding work, we demonstrated the topological robustness of this
semimetal phase against disorder and interactions. In this work, we delve
deeper into the semimetal's electronic properties, providing a precise
calculation of its Hall conductivity and response to circularly polarized
light, elaborating further on its bulk-edge correspondance leading to a half
topological semimetal.

<i>Fabian Künzel, André Erpenbeck, Daniel Werner, Enrico Arrigoni, Emanuel Gull, Guy Cohen, Martin Eckstein</i>
<p>A description of long-lived photo-doped states in Mott insulators is
challenging, as it needs to address exponentially separated timescales. We
demonstrate how properties of such states can be computed using numerically
exact steady state techniques, in particular Quantum Monte Carlo, by using a
time-local ansatz for the distribution function with separate Fermi functions
for the electron and hole quasiparticles. The simulations show that the Mott
gap remains robust to large photo-doping, and the photo-doped state has hole
and electron quasiparticles with strongly renormalized properties.

<h3>Investigating microstructure-property relationships of nonwovens by  model-based virtual materials testing</h3>

<br>
<i>Matthias Weber, Andreas Grießer, Dennis Mosbach, Erik Glatt, Andreas Wiegmann, Volker Schmidt</i>
<p>Quantifying the relationship between geometric descriptors of microstructure
and effective properties like permeability is essential for understanding and
improving the behavior of porous materials. In this paper, we employ a
previously developed stochastic model to investigate microstructure-property
relationships of nonwovens. First, we show the capability of the model to
generate a wide variety of realistic nonwovens by varying the model parameters.
By computing various geometric descriptors, we investigate the relationship
between model parameters and microstructure morphology and, in this way, assess
the range of structures which may be described by our model. In a second step,
we perform virtual materials testing based on the simulation of a wide range of
nonwovens. For these 3D structures, we compute geometric descriptors and
perform numerical simulations to obtain values for permeability as an effective
material property. We then examine and quantify the relationship between
microstructure morphology and permeability by fitting parametric regression
formulas to the obtained data set, including but not limited to formulas from
literature. We show that for structures which are captured by our model,
predictive power may be improved by allowing for slightly more complex
formulas.

<h3>Fabrication and extreme micromechanics of additive metal  microarchitectures</h3>

<p>Metal microarchitectures with 3-dimensional solid frames can exhibit
mechanical performance coming from the geometrical effect and characteristic
size effect of material under dynamic and extreme temperature conditions. In
this study, for the first time, full-metal Cu microlattices were fabricated via
localized electrodeposition in liquid (LEL) process which enables
high-precision additive manufacturing of metal at micro-scale. The
microlattices possess a unique microstructure with micron sized grains that are
rich with randomly oriented growth twins. They also have smooth surfaces and
near-ideal nodal connectivity. Furthermore, Cu microlattices exhibited unique
temperature (-150 and 25 Celcius degrees) and strain rate (0.001-100 s-1)
dependent deformation behavior during in situ micromechanical testing.
Systematic compression test of fully dense Cu micropillars, equivalent in
diameter and length to the strut of microlattice at comparable extreme loading
conditions, and post-mortem microstructural analysis revealed substantial
shifts in deformation mechanisms depending on the temperature and strain rate.
On one hand, at room temperature (25 Celcius degree), dislocation slip based
plastic deformation occurs and leads to localized deformation of micropillars.
On the other hand, at cryogenic temperature (-150 Celcius degree), mechanical
twinning occurs and leads to relatively homogeneous deformation of
micropillars. Based on the intrinsic deformation mechanisms at the component
level, the temperature and strain rate dependent deformation behavior of
microlattices is explained. Our findings provide valuable insights into the
intricate mechanical responses and potential applications of metallic
microarchitectures under dynamic and extreme temperature conditions.

<h3>Massive topological edge channels in three-dimensional topological  materials induced by extreme surface anisotropy</h3>

<i>Fengfeng Zhu, Chenqiang Hua, Xiao Wang, Lin Miao, Yixi Su, Makoto Hashimoto, Donghui Lu, Zhi-Xun Shen, Jin-Feng Jia, Yunhao Lu, Dandan Guan, Dong Qian</i>
<p>A two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator exhibits one-dimensional
gapless spin-filtered edge channels allowing for dissipationless transport of
charge and spin. However, the sophisticated fabrication requirement of
two-dimensional materials and the low capacity of one-dimensional channels
hinder the broadening applications. We introduce a method to manipulate a
three-dimensional topological material to host a large number of
one-dimensional topological edge channels utilizing surface anisotropy. Taking
ZrTe5 as a model system, we realize a highly anisotropic surface due to the
synergistic effect of the lattice geometry and Coulomb interaction, and achieve
massive one-dimensional topological edge channels -- confirmed by electronic
characterization using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in
combination with first-principles calculations. Our work provides a new avenue
to engineer the topological properties of three-dimensional materials through
nanoscale tunning of surface morphology and opens up a promising prospect for
the development of low-power-consumption electronic nano devices based on
one-dimensional topological edge channels.

<h3>Friction of a driven chain: Role of momentum conservation, Goldstone and  radiation modes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14075" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14075</a>
<br>
<i>Debankur Das, Richard Vink, Matthias Krüger</i>
<p>We analytically study friction and dissipation of a driven bead in a 1D
harmonic chain, and analyze the role of internal damping mechanism as well as
chain length. Specifically, we investigate Dissipative Particle Dynamics and
Langevin Dynamics, as paradigmatic examples that do and do not display
translational symmetry, with distinct results: For identical parameters, the
friction forces can differ by many orders of magnitude. For slow driving, a
Goldstone mode traverses the entire system, resulting in friction of the driven
bead that grows arbitrarily large (Langevin) or gets arbitrarily small
(Dissipative Particle Dynamics) with system size. For a long chain, the
friction for DPD is shown to be bound, while it shows a singularity (i.e. can
be arbitrarily large) for Langevin damping. For long underdamped chains, a
radiation mode is recovered in either case, with friction independent of
damping mechanism. For medium length chains, the chain shows the expected
resonant behavior. At the resonance, friction is non-analytic in damping
parameter $\gamma$, depending on it as $\gamma^{-1}$. Generally, no zero
frequency bulk friction coefficient can be determined, as the limits of small
frequency and infinite chain length do not commute, and we discuss the regimes
where "simple" macroscopic friction occurs.

<h3>Two dimensional quantum lattice models via mode optimized hybrid CPU-GPU  density matrix renormalization group method</h3>

<br>
<i>Andor Menczer, Kornél Kapás, Miklós Antal Werner, Örs Legeza</i>
<p>We present a hybrid numerical approach to simulate quantum many body problems
on two spatial dimensional quantum lattice models via the non-Abelian ab initio
version of the density matrix renormalization group method on state-of-the-art
high performance computing infrastructures. We demonstrate for the two
dimensional spinless fermion model and for the Hubbard model on torus geometry
that altogether several orders of magnitude in computational time can be saved
by performing calculations on an optimized basis and by utilizing hybrid
CPU-multiGPU parallelization. At least an order of magnitude reduction in
computational complexity results from mode optimization, while a further order
of reduction in wall time is achieved by massive parallelization. Our results
are measured directly in FLOP and seconds. A detailed scaling analysis of the
obtained performance as a function of matrix ranks and as a function of system
size up to $12\times 12$ lattice topology is discussed.

<h3>Phonon collapse and anharmonic melting of the 3D charge-density wave in  kagome metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Martin Gutierrez-Amigo, Ðorđe Dangić, Chunyu Guo, Claudia Felser, Philip J. W. Moll, Maia G. Vergniory, Ion Errea</i>
<p>The charge-density wave (CDW) mechanism and resulting structure of the AV3Sb5
family of kagome metals has posed a puzzling challenge since their discovery
four years ago. In fact, the lack of consensus on the origin and structure of
the CDW hinders the understanding of the emerging phenomena. Here, by employing
a non-perturbative treatment of anharmonicity from first-principles
calculations, we reveal that the charge-density transition in CsV3Sb5 is driven
by the large electron-phonon coupling of the material and that the melting of
the CDW state is attributed to ionic entropy and lattice anharmonicity. The
calculated transition temperature is in very good agreement with experiments,
implying that soft mode physics are at the core of the charge-density wave
transition. Contrary to the standard assumption associated with a pure kagome
lattice, the CDW is essentially three-dimensional as it is triggered by an
unstable phonon at the L point. The absence of involvement of phonons at the M
point enables us to constrain the resulting symmetries to six possible space
groups. The unusually large electron-phonon linewidth of the soft mode explains
why inelastic scattering experiments did not observe any softened phonon. We
foresee that large anharmonic effects are ubiquitous and could be fundamental
to understand the observed phenomena also in other kagome families.

<h3>Flux enhanced localization and reentrant delocalization in the quantum  walk of interacting bosons on two-leg ladder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14117" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14117</a>
<br>
<i>Mrinal Kanti Giri, Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra</i>
<p>We study the quantum walk of two bosons possessing onsite repulsive
interaction on a two-leg ladder and show that the presence of uniform flux
piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder favors the localization of the
bound states in the dynamics. We find that when the two bosons are
symmetrically initialized on the edge rung of the ladder, they tend to
edge-localize in their quantum walk - a phenomenon which is not possible in the
absence of flux. On the other hand, when the bosons are initialized on the bulk
rung they never localize and exhibit linear spreading in their quantum walk.
Interestingly, however, we find that in the later case a finite flux favours
localization of the bulk bound states in the presence of sufficiently weak
quasiperiodic disorder which is otherwise insufficient to localize the
particles in the absence of flux. In both the cases, we obtain that the
localization in the dynamics strongly depends on the combined effect of the
flux and interaction strengths, as a result which we obtain a signature of
re-entrant delocalization as a function of flux (interaction) for fixed
interaction (flux) strengths.

<i>David López-Núñez, Queralt Portell Montserrat, Gemma Rius, Elia Bertoldo, Alba Torras-Coloma, M. Martínez, P. Forn-Díaz</i>
<p>We present a study of the superconducting penetration depth $\lambda$ in
aluminum thin films of varying thickness. The range of thicknesses chosen spans
from the thin-film regime to the regime approaching bulk behavior. The
penetration depths observed range from $\lambda = 163.3\pm0.4~\rm{nm}$ for the
thinnest $20~\rm{nm}$ samples down to $\lambda = 53.6\pm0.4~\rm{nm}$ for the
$200~\rm{nm}$-thick ones. In order to accurately determine $\lambda$, we
performed complementary measurements using the frequency of superconducting
$LC$ resonators as well as the resistance of normal-state meanders. Both
methods yield comparable results, providing a well-characterized set of values
of $\lambda$ in aluminum in the relevant range for applications in fields such
as quantum computing and microwave radiation detector technologies.

<br>
<i>A. I. Bezuglyj, I. V. Mironenko, V. A. Shklovskij</i>
<p>Heat transfer in layered metal-dielectric structures is considered
theoretically based on an analytical solution of the Boltzmann transfer
equation for the phonon distribution function. Taking into account the size
effect, the problem of effective cross-plane thermal conductivity of structures
containing two metal layers is analyzed in detail. If the thickness of the
metal layers is less than the phonon mean free path, interlayer heat transfer
is carried out predominantly by phonons, and the effective cross-plane thermal
conductivity is determined by the reflection of phonons from the
metal/dielectric interfaces. In the opposite case of thick metal layers, the
effective cross-plane thermal conductivity is determined both by the thermal
conductivity of the metal layers and by the thermal resistance of the
dielectric layers. The results obtained are generalized to multilayer
structures and superlattices.

<br>
<i>Nikhil Kumar, Paweł Gruszecki, Mateusz Gołębiewski, Jarosław W. Kłos, Maciej Krawczyk</i>
<p>Confined spin-wave modes are a promising object for studying nonlinear
effects and future quantum technologies. Here, using micromagnetic simulations,
we use a microwave magnetic field from a coplanar waveguide (CPW) to pump a
standing spin-wave confined in the cavity of magnonic crystal. We find that the
frequency of the fundamental cavity mode is equal to the ferromagnetic
resonance frequency of the plane film and overlaps with the magnonic bandgap,
allowing high magnetic field tunability. Multi-frequency harmonics of the
cavity mode are generated once the microwave amplitude surpasses a certain
threshold. Specifically, the second and third harmonics at 0.5 T equate to 48.6
and 72.9 GHz with wavelengths of 44 and 22 nm respectively, which propagate
into the crystal. This effect reaches saturation when the CPW covers the entire
cavity, making the system feasible for realization. These processes show
potential for the advancement of magnonics at high-frequencies and very
short-wavelengths.

<i>Ayushi Singhania, Jeroen van den Brink, Satoshi Nishimoto</i>
<p>The search for Kitaev spin liquid states has recently broadened to include a
number of honeycomb materials with integer spin moments. The qualitative
difference with their spin-1/2 counterparts is the presence of single-ion
anisotropy (SIA). This motivates our investigation of the effects of SIA on the
ground state of the spin-$1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model using the
density-matrix renormalization group which allows construction of detailed
phase diagrams around the Kitaev points. We demonstrate that positive
out-of-plane SIA induces an in-plane vortex state without the need for
off-diagonal interactions. Conversely, negative SIA facilitates the emergence
of a ferromagnetic state in presence of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
interactions, while a N\`eel state can emerge for ferromagnetic Heisenberg
coupling. These findings, pertinent even for weak SIA, not only enhance our
theoretical understanding of the spin-1 KH model but also propose experimental
prospects for observing these novel magnetic states in material realizations.

<p>Star colloids are rigid particles with long and slender arms connected to a
central core. We show numerically that the colloid shapes control the rheology
of their suspensions. In particular, colloids with curved arms and hooks can
entangle with neighbor particles and form large clusters that can sustain high
stresses. When a large cluster permeates the whole system the viscosity
increases many fold. Contrary to the case of spherical colloids we observe that
these effects are very strong even at moderate volumes fraction over a wide
range of P\'eclet numbers.

well established, but the converse phenomena remains relatively less explored.
Theoretical work on the subject includes Anderson and Suhl prediction of a

insulators exchange coupled through a superconductor. In this study, we present
compelling evidence of coexistence of both phenomena in a superconducting spin
valve system. We demonstrate that superconducting exchange coupling enables
reliable bistable states, and the coexistence of SEC and CFM leads to a wide
range of reproducible zero field micro-magnetic states in the SSV, which are a
function of the strength of the superconducting state. These micromagnetic
states can in turn influence the superconducting state, leading to multiple
reproducible and non-volatile resistance states; thus paving the way for a
novel direction in cryogenic in-memory computing.

morphologies within the framework of the Helfrich model. Vesicle shapes are
determined by minimizing the elastic energy subject to constraints of constant
area and volume. The results show that pressurized vesicles can adopt
higher-energy spindle-like configurations that require the action of point
forces at the poles. If the internal pressure is lower than the external one,
multilobed shapes are predicted. We utilize our results to rationalize the

<i>Nina Andrejevic, Tao Zhou, Qingteng Zhang, Suresh Narayanan, Mathew J. Cherukara, Maria K. Y. Chan</i>
<p>Coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) techniques are capable of interrogating
dynamics of nano- to mesoscale materials systems at time scales spanning
several orders of magnitude. However, obtaining accurate theoretical
descriptions of complex dynamics is often limited by one or more factors -- the
ability to visualize dynamics in real space, computational cost of
high-fidelity simulations, and effectiveness of approximate or phenomenological
models. In this work, we develop a data-driven framework to uncover mechanistic
models of dynamics directly from time-resolved CXS measurements without solving
the phase reconstruction problem for the entire time series of diffraction
patterns. Our approach uses neural differential equations to parameterize
unknown real-space dynamics and implements a computational scattering forward
model to relate real-space predictions to reciprocal-space observations. This
method is shown to recover the dynamics of several computational model systems
under various simulated conditions of measurement resolution and noise.
Moreover, the trained model enables estimation of long-term dynamics well
beyond the maximum observation time, which can be used to inform and refine
experimental parameters in practice. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental
proof-of-concept by applying our framework to recover the probe trajectory from
a ptychographic scan. Our proposed framework bridges the wide existing gap
between approximate models and complex data.

<p>Recently, there is an interest in studying the bulk-edge correspondence for
nonlinear eigenvalues problems in a two-dimensional topological system with
spin-orbit coupling. By introducing auxiliary eigenvalues, the nonlinear
bulk-edge correspondence was established. In this paper, taking the Haldane
model as an example, we address that such a correspondence will appear in two
dimensional topological system without spin-orbit coupling. The resulting edge
states are characterized by the Chern number of the auxiliary energy band. A
full phase diagram containing topological nontrivial phase, topological trivial
phase, and metallic phase is obtained. Our work generalizes the study of the
bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems in two-dimensional

<h3>Anisotropy-induced Coulomb phase and quasiparticle zoo in the atomic  monopole-spin hybrid system</h3>

<p>Quantum simulation of a monopole-spin hybrid system is performed on basis of
a dipolar ultracold gas in a ladder lattice. The site-occupation states of the
dipolar ladder lattice gas can spontaneously emulate both the monopole and spin
excitations. The hopping of the atoms induces a particle conversion process
between spin and monopole pairs, and the dipole-dipole interaction determines
the spin-spin, spin-monopole and monopole-monopole interactions. The
anisotropic nature of the dipole-dipole interaction allows hereby for a
flexible engineering of the designed hybrid system, and for a significant
tunability of the interaction strengths. As a result, we encounter a rich phase
diagram, and specifically a self-assembled Coulomb phase arises, in which
monopoles and spins coexist and are orderly arranged according to the local
Gauss's law. The Coulomb phase hosts a zoo of different types of
quasiparticles, and provides the possibility to simulate various phenomena in
particle physics, such as a degenerate vacuum, particle decay and conversion
processes. Our work provides a significant extension of the scope of quantum
simulations based on the anisotropy of dipolar interactions.

<p>Choosing the right spin polarization of electron enables its local injection
into the helical edge state with a well-defined momentum direction, despite the
uncertainty principle, owing to spin-momentum locking. This fact facilitates a
direct identification of odd-frequency pairing through parity measurement
(under frequency reversal) of the anomalous Green's function in a setup
comprising multi-terminal Josephson junction on the helical edge state of a 2D
topological insulator.

<p>The search for two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) multiferroics is an
exciting yet challenging endeavor. Room-temperature 2D vdW few-layer
multiferroic is a much bigger insurmountable obstacle. Here we report the
discovery of an unconventional 2D vdW multiferroic with out-of-plane
ferroelectric polarization and long-range magnetic orders in trilayer NiI2
device from 10 K to 295 K. The evolutions of magnetic domains with magnetic
field, and the evolutions between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phase
have been unambiguously observed. More significantly, we realize a robust
mutual control of magnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature. The
magnetic domains are manipulated by a small voltage ranging from 1 V to 6 V at
0 T and 295 K. This work opens opportunities for exploring multiferroic physics
at the limit of few atomic layers.

<p>We present a detailed study of the properties of unitary Bose polarons, i.e.,
impurities strongly interacting with a bath of dilute bosons via a short-range
potential with infinite scattering length. Through a comparison with Diffusion
Monte-Carlo calculations, we demonstrate that the Gross-Pitaevskii theory
accurately describes the properties of a heavy impurity if the gas parameter
remains small everywhere in the system, including the vicinity of the impurity.
Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the finite range of the bath-bath
interaction potential by means of a non-local extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation and we discuss the applicability of the Born approximation.

<p>Doping tin surface epitaxially grown on silicon, Sn/Si(111), with boron atoms
yields the appearance of a superconducting (SC) phase below $T_c\sim 4-5$K.
Even though the pairing mechanism remains unknown, experimental evidence of
chiral $d-$wave superconductivity has been recently reported, then ruling out a
phonon-mediated pairing. Here we study theoretically the SC phase and
symmetries of the doped Sn/Si(111) within a $t-J$ model. We analyze the
photo-excitation of the system by intense THz pulses and show that the
polarization dependence of the induced current can distinguish between
different symmetries of the SC gap, thus providing a novel experimental mean to
investigate the spectroscopic features of the Sn/Si(111) across the SC
transition.

<h3>Theory of fractional Chern insulator states in pentalayer graphene  moiré superlattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14368</a>
<br>
<i>Zhongqing Guo, Xin Lu, Bo Xie, Jianpeng Liu</i>
<p>The experimental discoveries of fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in
both transition metal dichalcogenide and pentalayer graphene moir\'e
superlattices have aroused significant research interest. In this work, we
theoretically study the fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (also known as
fractional Chern insulator states) in pentalayer graphene moir\'e superlattice.
Starting from the highest energy scale ($\sim\!1\,$eV) of the continuum model,
we first construct a renormalized low-energy model that applies to a lower
cutoff $\sim\!0.15\,$eV using renormalization group approach. Then, we study
the ground states of the renormalized low-energy model at filling 1 under
Hartree-Fock approximation in the presence of tunable but self-consistently
screend displacement field $D$ with several experimentally relevant background
dielectric constant $\epsilon_r$. Two competing Hartree-Fock states are
obtained at filling 1, which give rise to two types of topologically distrinct
isolated flat bands with Chern number 1 and 0, respectively. We continue to
explore the interacting ground states of the two types of isolated flat bands
at hole dopings of 1/3, 2/5, 3/5, and 2/3 (corresponding electron fillings of
2/3, 3/5, 2/5, 1/3 with respect to charge neutrality). Our exact-diagonlization
calculations suggest that the system stays in fractional Chern insulator (FCI)
state at 2/3 electron filling when $0.9\,\textrm{V/nm}\leq\!D\!\leq
0.92\,\textrm{V/nm}$ and $5\lessapprox\epsilon_r\lessapprox 6$; while no robust
FCI state is obtained at 1/3 electron filling in the experimentally relevant
parameter regime. We have also obtained composite-fermion type FCI ground
states at 3/5 electron filling within $0.9\,\textrm{V/nm}\leq\! D
\!\leq\!0.96\,\textrm{V/nm}$ and $\epsilon_r\approx 5$. These numerical results
are quantitatively consistent with experimental observations.

<h3>Electrically tunable correlated domain wall network in twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Hao-Chien Wang, Chen-Hsuan Hsu</i>
<p>We investigate the domain wall network in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG)
under the influence of interlayer bias and screening effect from the layered
structure. Starting from the continuum model, we analyze the low-energy domain
wall modes within the moir\'e bilayer structure and obtain an analytical form
representing charge density distributions of the two-dimensional structure.
With the efficient calculation of screened electron-electron interaction
strengths both within and between the domain walls, we develop a bosonized
model that describes the correlated domain wall network. We demonstrate that
these interaction strengths can be modified through an applied interlayer bias,
screening length and dielectric materials, and show how the model can be
employed to investigate various properties of the domain wall network and its
stability. This finding reveals the TBG network as a promising platform for the
experimental manipulation of electron-electron interactions in low dimensions
and the study of strongly correlated matter. We point out that the
investigation not only enhances the understanding of domain wall modes in TBG
but also has broader implications for the development of graphene-based
devices.

<h3>On the structure factor of jammed particle configurations on the  one-dimensional lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14393" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14393</a>
<br>
<i>Jean-Marc Luck</i>
<p>A broad class of blocked or jammed configurations of particles on the
one-dimensional lattice can be characterized in terms of local rules involving
only the lengths of clusters of particles (occupied sites) and of holes (empty
sites). Examples of physical relevance include the metastable states reached by
kinetically constrained spin chains, the attractors of totally irreversible
processes such as random sequential adsorption, and arrays of Rydberg atoms in
the blockade regime. The configurational entropy of ensembles of such blocked
configurations has been investigated recently by means of an approach inspired
from the theory of stochastic renewal processes. This approach provides a
valuable alternative to the more traditional transfer-matrix formalism. We show
that the renewal approach is also an efficient tool to investigate a range of
observables in uniform ensembles of blocked configurations, besides their
configurational entropy. The main emphasis is on their structure factor and
correlation function.

<h3>Commensurate-incommensurate transition in frustrated Wigner crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14396" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14396</a>
<br>
<i>Raphaël Menu, Jorge Yago Malo, Vladan Vuletić, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Giovanna Morigi</i>
<p>Geometric frustration in systems with long-range interactions is a largely
unexplored phenomenon. In this work we analyse the ground state emerging from
the competition between a periodic potential and a Wigner crystal in one
dimension, consisting of a selforganized chain of particles with the same
charge. This system is a paradigmatic realization of the Frenkel-Kontorova
model with Coulomb interactions. We derive the action of a Coulomb soliton in
the continuum limit and demonstrate the mapping to a massive (1+1) Thirring
model with long-range interactions. Here, the solitons are charged fermionic
excitations over an effective Dirac sea. The mismatch between the periodicities
of potential and chain, giving rise to frustration, is a chemical potential
whose amplitude is majorly determined by the Coulomb self-energy. The
mean-field limit is a long-range antiferromagnetic spin chain with uniform
magnetic field and predicts that the commensurate, periodic structures form a
complete devil's staircase as a function of the charge density. Each step of
the staircase correspond to the interval of stability of a stable commensurate
phase and scales with the number $N$ of charges as $1/\ln N$. This implies that
there is no commensurate-incommensurate phase transition in the thermodynamic
limit. For finite systems, however, the ground state has a fractal structure
that could be measured in experiments with laser-cooled ions in traps.

<h3>Evaporation of Colloidal Suspension Droplets over Oil-infused Slippery  Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14406" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14406</a>
<br>
<i>Sumita Sahoo, Rabibrata Mukherjee</i>
<p>Evaporative drying of colloidal droplets with different concentrations (Ci)
on liquid infused slippery substrate (LISS) surfaces fabricated over
biomimetically patterned sticky hydrophobic surfaces is reported here. These
slippery surfaces remain stable under the aqueous droplets. The effective
thickness of the infused oil layer (hE) was varied and its effect on the
evaporation dynamics, wetting ridge formation and the final deposition pattern
were studied using an optical microscope as well as a contact angle goniometer.
The results were contrasted to those obtained over bare (oil-free) flat and
patterned sticky surfaces. Unlike strong pinning and consequent peripheral ring
deposit invariably observed in evaporation of a colloidal droplet over a solid
surface (i.e. bare flat Sylgard 184 without oil), over a LISS, the dynamics,
including the extent of pinning and the final deposit morphology, were found to
be strongly dependant on hE. Due to the presence of the underlying patterns,
the extent of pinning increased with a reduction in hE. Prolonged evaporation
over a LISS leads to a uniform deposition due to gravity-induced settling of
the colloids followed by capillarity-mediated rearrangement of the particles.
Colloidal assembly at the droplet free surface and the droplet-wetting ridge
interface leads to a thinner encapsulating oil layer and faster drainage of the
wetting ridge resulting in a higher evaporation rate before pinning of the
suspension droplets over all LISS surfaces.

<h3>Long-standing heterogeneity in shear-thickening suspension subjected to  swirling excitation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14408" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14408</a>
<br>
<i>Li-Xin Shi, Song-Chuan Zhao</i>
<p>The heterogeneity in shear thickened state has recently gained attention. In
this study, we present a novel dynamic phenomenon in a dense suspension with a
free surface subjected to swirling excitation. When the volume fraction $\Phi$
and the oscillation frequency $f$ are beyond a critical threshold, numerous
persistent jammed clusters emerge in the high-$\phi$ region of the density
waves. A reduction in the thickness of the suspension shifts these critical
$\Phi$ and $f$ to lower values. The jammed cluster drives the downstream
suspension to accelerate forward, creating a steep density gradient upstream, a
notable difference from the previously reported motion associated with density
waves. Our results shed light on the evolution of heterogeneity, primarily
governed by the interplay between kinematic instability and particle migrations
under free surface conditions. The negative slope of the constitutive curve is
not necessary for instability in this context. Furthermore, when the suspension
is constrained by rigid confinement, no high-density regions persist beyond one
period.

<h3>Can tunneling current in molecular junctions be so strongly temperature  dependent to challenge a hopping mechanism? Analytical formulas answer this  question and provide important insight into large area junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14415" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14415</a>
<br>
<i>Ioan Baldea</i>
<p>{Analytical equations like Richardson-Dushman's or Shockley's provided a
general, if simplified conceptual background, which was widely accepted in
conventional electronics and made a fundamental contribution to advances in the
field. In the attempt to develop a (highly desirable, but so far missing)
counterpart for molecular electronics, in this work, we deduce a general
analytical formula for the tunneling current through molecular junctions
mediated by a single level that is valid for any bias voltage and temperature.
Starting from this expression, which is exact and obviates cumbersome numerical
integration, in the low and high temperature limits we also provide analytical
formulas expressing the current in terms of elementary functions. They are
accurate for broad model parameter ranges relevant for real molecular
junctions. Within this theoretical framework we show that: (i) by varying the
temperature, the tunneling current can vary by several orders of magnitude,
thus debunking the myth that a strong temperature dependence of the current is
evidence for a hopping mechanism, (ii) real molecular junctions can undergo a
gradual (Sommerfeld-Arrhenius) transition from a weakly temperature dependent
to a strongly (``exponential'') temperature dependent current that can be tuned
by the applied bias, and (iii) important insight into large area molecular
junctions with eutectic gallium indium alloy (EGaIn) top electrodes can be
gained. E.g., merely based on transport data, we estimate that the current
carrying molecules represent only a fraction of f \approx 4 \times 10^{-4} out
of the total number of molecules in a large area \ce{Au-S-(CH2)13-CH_3 / EGaIn}
junction.

<h3>Effect of the depolarizing field on the domain structure of an improper  ferroelectric</h3>

<br>
<i>Aaron Merlin Müller, Amadé Bortis, Manfred Fiebig, Thomas Lottermoser</i>
<p>We show that, contrary to common belief, the depolarizing electric field
generated by bound charges at thin-film surfaces can have a substantial impact
on the domain structure of an improper ferroelectric with topological defects.
In hexagonal-manganite thin films, we observe in phase-field simulations that
through the action of the depolarizing field, (i) the average magnitude of the
polarization density decreases, (ii) the local magnitude of the polarization
density decreases with increasing distance from the domain walls, and (iii)
there is a significant alteration of the domain-size distribution, which is
visualized with the pair-correlation function. We conclude that, in general, it
is not appropriate to ignore the effects of the depolarizing field for thin
film ferroelectrics.

<h3>Correlation between microstructural deformation mechanisms and acoustic  parameters on a cold-rolled Cu30Zn brass</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14430" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14430</a>
<br>
<i>Maria Sosa, Linton Carvajal, Vicente Salinas, Fernando Lund, Claudio Aguilar, Felipe Castro</i>
<p>The relationship between acoustic parameters and the microstructure of a
Cu30Zn brass plate subjected to plastic deformation was evaluated. The plate,
previously annealed at 550 {\deg}C for 30 minutes, was cold rolled to
reductions in the 10-70\% range. Using the pulse-echo method, linear ultrasonic
measurements were performed on each of the nine specimens, corresponding to the
nine different reductions, recording the wave times of flight of longitudinal
wave along the thickness axis. Subsequently, acoustic measurements were
performed to determine the nonlinear parameter ($\beta$) through the second
harmonic generation. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a steady increase and
subsequent saturation of deformation twins at 40\% thickness reduction. At
higher deformations, the microstructure revealed the generation and
proliferation of shear bands, which coincided with a decrease in the twinning
structure and an increase in dislocation density rate. Longitudinal wave
velocity exhibited a 0.9\% decrease at 20\% deformation, followed by a
continuous increase of 2\% beyond this point. These results can be rationalized
as a competition between a proliferation of dislocations, which tends to
decrease the linear sound velocity, and a decrease in average grain size, which
tends to increase it. These variations are in agreement with the values
obtained with XRD, Vickers hardness and metallography measurements. The
nonlinear parameter $\beta$ shows a significant maximum, at the factor of 8
level, at 40\% deformation. This maximum correlates well with a similar
maximum, at a factor of ten level and also at 40\% deformation, of the twinning
fault probability.

<h3>Solid-that-flows picture of glass-forming liquids</h3>

<br>
<i>Jeppe C. Dyre</i>
<p>This article reviews arguments that glass-forming liquids are different from
those of standard liquid-state theory. The latter typically have a viscosity in
the mPa$\cdot$s range and relaxation times of order picoseconds, while these
numbers grow dramatically and become $10^{12}-10^{15}$ times larger for liquids
cooled toward the glass transition. This translates into a qualitative
difference, and below the ``solidity length'' which is of order one micron at
the glass transition, a glass-forming liquid behaves much like a solid. Recent
numerical evidence for the solidity of ultraviscous liquids is reviewed, and
experimental consequences are discussed in relation to dynamic heterogeneity,
frequency-dependent linear-response functions, and the temperature dependence
of the average relaxation time.

<h3>Mechanism of charge transfer and electrostatic field fluctuations in  high entropy metallic alloys</h3>

<br>
<i>Wai-Ga D. Ho, Wasim Raja Mondal, Hanna Terletska, Ka-Ming Tam, Mariia Karabin, Markus Eisenbach, Yang Wang, Vladimir Dobrosavljevic</i>
<p>High entropy alloys present a new class of disordered metals which hold
promising prospects for the next generation of materials and technology.
However, much of the basic physics underlying these robust, multifunctional
materials -- and those of other, more generic forms of disordered matter --
still remain the subject of ongoing inquiry. We thus present a minimal-working
model that describes the disorder-driven fluctuations in the electronic charge
distributions and electrostatic "Madelung" fields in disordered metals. Our
theory follows a standard perturbative scheme and captures the leading
contributions from dominant electronic processes, including electrostatic
screening and impurity scattering events. We show here that a modest
first-order treatment incorporating these effects is sufficient to reproduce
the linear charge transfer trends featured in both high-entropy and other
conventional alloys, our model also shedding light on the microscopic origins
of these statistical features. We further elaborate on the nature of these
electronic charge and Madelung field fluctuations by determining how these
emerge from the statistics of the underlying disorder, and how these can be
described using the linear response formulation that we develop here. In doing
so, our work answers various questions which have long-perplexed the disordered
materials community. It also opens up possible avenues for providing systematic
corrections to modern first-principles approaches to disorder-modeling (e.g.
the conventional CPA method) which currently lack these statistical features.

<h3>Ferroelectricity and chirality in the Pb$_5$Ge$_3$O$_{11}$ crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14466" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14466</a>
<br>
<i>Mauro Fava, William Lafargue-Dit-Hauret, Aldo H. Romero, Eric Bousquet</i>
<p>We study from first-principles calculations the ferroelectric structural
phase transition of Pb$_5$Ge$_3$O$_{11}$ crystal. The calculations of phonons
and Born effective charges of the paraelectric phase allow us to identify a
polar instability that is unstable in both transverse-optic and
longitudinal-optic versions, giving rise to an entire branch of instability
along a propagation vector parallel to the mode polarization (the hexagonal
axe). This is the hint of hyperferroelectricity and the stable head-to-head and
tail-to-tail domain, as recently reported from both experiments and theory.
Then, our analysis of the ferroelectric phase shows that the polarization of
Pb$_5$Ge$_3$O$_{11}$ is uniaxial along the hexagonal axes and with small
in-plane components due to a piezoelectric effect. The symmetry-adapted mode
analysis shows that the total ferroelectric ground state distortion comes
mainly from polar distortions of the unstable polar phonon mode but also from
an invariant, cooperative mode that amplifies the polar distortion. We also
build a phenomenological model that highlights how the coupling between these
modes is at play and helps us understand how to reproduce the second-order
phase transition. At last, we also quantify the structural chirality through
the continuous symmetry measure method and trace its origin to the polar
unstable mode itself. By extending our approach to the phonon states we further
clarify why the final ground state distortion is more chiral than the unstable
polar mode responsible for the symmetry lowering. Finally we study the phonon
angular momentum (AM) distribution in both phases and identify trends in the AM
behaviour across the Brillouin zone.

<p>Tuning superconductivity in topological materials by means of chemical
substitution, electrostatic gating, or pressure is thought to be an effective
route towards realizing topological superconductivity with their inherent
Majorana fermions, the manipulation of which may form the basis for future
topological quantum computing. It has recently been established that the
pseudo-binary chalcogenides (ACh)m(Pn2Ch3)n (A = Ge, Mn, Pb, etc.; Pn = Sb or
Bi; Ch = Te, Se) may host novel topological quantum states such as the quantum
anomalous Hall effect and topological axion states. Here we map out the phase
diagram of one member in this series, the topological insulator candidate
GeSb4Te7 up to pressures of ~35 GPa, through a combination of electrical
resistance measurements, Raman spectroscopy, as well as first-principles
calculations. Three distinct superconducting phases emerge under the pressure
above ~11, ~17, and ~31 GPa, which are accompanied by concomitant structural
transitions, evidenced from the changes in the Raman modes. The
first-principles calculations validate the existence of a topological
insulating state at ambient pressure and predict two possible structural
transitions at 10 and 17 GPa, in agreement with the experimental observations.
Overall, our results establish the GeSb4Te7 family of materials as a fertile
arena for further exploring various topological phenomena, including
topological phase transitions and putative topological superconductivity.

<p>The creation of temperature variations in magnetization, and hence in the
frequencies of the magnon spectrum in laser-heated regions of magnetic films,
is an important method for studying Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons,
magnon supercurrents, Bogoliubov waves, and similar phenomena. In our study, we
demonstrate analytically, numerically, and experimentally that, in addition to
the magnetization variations, it is necessary to consider the connected
variations of the demagnetizing field. In case of a heat induced local minimum
of the saturation magnetization, the combination of these two effects results
in a local increase in the minimum frequency value of the magnon dispersion at
which the Bose-Einstein condensate emerges. As a result, a magnon supercurrent
directed away from the hot region is formed.

<i>Fabrizio Camerin, Susana Marín-Aguilar, Marjolein Dijkstra</i>
<p>The intricate interplay between colloidal particle shape and precisely
engineered interaction potentials has paved the way for the discovery of
unprecedented crystal structures in both two and three dimensions. Here, we
make use of anisotropic triblock colloidal particles composed of two distinct
materials. The resulting surface charge heterogeneity can be exploited to
generate regioselective depletion interactions and directional bonding. Using
extensive molecular dynamics simulations and a dimensionality reduction
analysis approach, we map out state diagrams for the self-assembly of such
colloids as a function of their aspect ratio and packing fraction for varying
depletant sizes in a quasi two-dimensional set-up. We observe the formation of
a wide variety of crystal structures such as a herringbone, brick-wall, tilted
brick-wall, and (tilted) ladder-like structures. More specifically, we
determine the optimal parameters to enhance crystallization, and investigate
the nucleation process. Additionally, we explore the potential of using crystal
monolayers as templates for deposition, thereby creating complex
three-dimensional structures that hold promise for future applications.

<p>The detection of a voltage transverse to both an applied current and a
magnetic field is one of the most common characterization techniques in
solid-state physics. The corresponding component of the resistivity tensor
$\rho_{ij}$ can be separated into odd and even parts with respect to the
applied magnetic field. The former contains information, for example, about the
ordinary or anomalous Hall effect. The latter is typically ascribed to
experimental artefacts and ignored. We here show that upon suppressing these
artefacts in carefully controlled experiments, useful information remains. We
first investigate the well-explored ferromagnet CoFeB, where the even part of
$\rho_{yx}$ contains a contribution from the anisotropic magnetoresistance,
which we confirm by Stoner-Wohlfarth modelling. We then apply our approach to
magnetotransport measurements in $\rm Mn_5Si_3$ thin films with a complex
compensated magnetic order. In this material, the even part of the transverse
signal is sizable only in the low-spin-symmetry phase below $\approx 80$ K and
thus offers a simple and readily available probe of the magnetic order.

photoluminescence spectroscopy. This experiment provides access to the
sub-nanosecond evolution of the free electron density, indirectly injected in
the quantum-wells. In particular, the modelling of the time-dependent
photoluminescence spectra unveils the time evolution of the temperature and of
the chemical potentials for electrons and holes, from which the sub-nanosecond
time-dependent electron density is determined. This information allows to prove
that the recombination of excited carriers is mainly radiative and bimolecular
at early delays after excitation, while, as the carrier density decreases, a
monomolecular and non-radiative recombination channel becomes relevant. Access
to the sub-nanosecond chronology of the mechanisms responsible for the
relaxation of charge carriers provides a wealth of information for designing
novel luminescent devices with engineered spectral and temporal behavior.

<p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its
properties with respect to an external stimulus. This self-induced effect
generally belongs to both the natural and technological realm, ranging from
neural networks to optics and electronic circuitry. In electronics, back-action
mechanisms are at the heart of many classes of devices such as amplifiers,
oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be
successfully exploited to achieve $\textit{non-reciprocal}$ transport in
superconducting circuits. Our device realizes a supercurrent diode, since the
dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport
occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on
magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic
fields to break time-reversal symmetry. In our implementation, back-action
solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no
asymmetry between the current bias directions into a diode, where the critical
current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the
supercurrent with the device stems from the gate tunability of the critical
current, which uniquely promotes up to $\sim$88% of magnetic field-free signal
rectification and diode functionality with selectable polarity. The concept we
introduce is very general and can be applied directly to a large variety of
devices, thereby opening novel functionalities in superconducting electronics.

<h3>In situ Imaging of Precipitate Formation in Additively Manufactured  Al-Alloys by Scanning X-ray Fluorescence</h3>

<i>Isac Lazar, Bharat Mehta, Vendulka Bertschová, Sri Bala Aditya Malladi, Zhe Ren, Srashtasrita Das, Johannes Hagemann, Gerald Falkenberg, Karin Frisk, Anders Mikkelsen, Lars Nyborg</i>
<p>A new family of high-strength Al-alloys has recently been developed, tailored
for the powder bed fusion-laser beam process. In these alloys, Mn, Cr and Zr
are incorporated in solid solution at amounts up to three times that of
equilibrium in the as-printed state. Mn and Cr-enriched precipitates that form
during printing and heat treatment influence the material's mechanical
properties. In this study, direct imaging of these precipitates was
accomplished through the utilisation of in situ synchrotron-based scanning
X-ray fluorescence. During heat treatment, a selective accumulation of Cr and
Mn in two distinct types of precipitates at grain boundaries was observed.
Additionally, the microstructure at the melt-pool boundary, containing
precipitates found in the as-printed state, remains thermally stable during the
heat treatment. The study demonstrates the significant value of employing
high-sensitivity in-situ X-ray fluorescence microscopy in exploring the
kinetics of sub-micrometre scale precipitation.

<i>Ragheed Alhyder, Frédéric Chevy, Xavier Leyronas</i>
<p>We perform a diagrammatic analysis of the energy of a mobile impurity
immersed in a strongly interacting two component Fermi gas to second order in
the impurity-bath interaction. These corrections demonstrate divergent behavior
in the limit of large impurity momentum. We show the fundamental processes
responsible for these logarithmically divergent terms.
We study the problem in the general case without any assumptions regarding
the fermion-fermion interactions in the bath. We show that the divergent term
can be summed up to all orders in the Fermi-Fermi interaction and that the
resulting expression is equivalent to the one obtained in the few body
calculation.
Finally, we provide a perturbative calculation to the second order in the
Fermi-Fermi interaction in the annex, and we show the diagrams responsible for
these terms.

<i>Hon Lam Cheung, Petter Uvdal, Mohsen Mirkhalaf</i>
<p>High-fidelity full-field micro-mechanical modeling of the non-linear
path-dependent materials demands a substantial computational effort. Recent
trends in the field incorporates data-driven Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
as surrogate models. However, ANNs are inherently data-hungry, functioning as a
bottleneck for the development of high-fidelity data-driven models. This study
introduces a novel approach for data augmentation, expanding an original
dataset without additional computational simulations. A Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) was trained and validated on high-fidelity micro-mechanical
simulations of elasto-plastic short fiber reinforced composites. The obtained
results showed a considerable improvement of the network predictions trained on
expanded datasets using the proposed data augmentation approach. The proposed
method for augmentation of scarce data may be used not only for other kind of
composites, but also for other materials and at different length scales, and
hence, opening avenues for innovative data-driven models in materials science
and computational mechanics.

<h3>Layer-dependent superconductivity in iron-based superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Ke Meng, Xu Zhang, Boqin Song, Baizhuo Li, Xiangming Kong, Sicheng Huang, Xiaofan Yang, Xiaobo Jin, Yiyuan Wu, Jiaying Nie, Guanghan Cao, Shiyan Li</i>
<p>The Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem states that a two-dimensional system
cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry at finite temperature. This is
supported by the observation of layer-dependent superconductivity in the
quasi-two-dimensional superconductor NbSe2, in which the superconducting
transition temperature (Tc) is reduced by about 60% in the monolayer limit.
However, for the extremely anisotropic copper-based high-Tc superconductor
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (Bi-2212), the Tc of the monolayer is almost identical
to that of its bulk counterpart. To clarify the effect of dimensionality on
superconductivity, here we successfully fabricate ultrathin flakes of
CsCa2Fe4As4F2, a highly anisotropic iron-based high-Tc superconductor, down to
monolayer. The monolayer flake exhibits the highest Tc of 24 K (after tuning to
the optimal doping by ionic liquid gating), which is about 20% lower than that
of the bulk crystal. We also fabricate ultrathin flakes of CaKFe4As4, another
iron-based superconductor with much smaller anisotropy. The Tc of the 3-layer
flake decreases by 46%, showing a more pronounced dimensional effect than that
of CsCa2Fe4As4F2. By carefully examining their anisotropy and the c-axis
coherence length, we reveal the general trend and empirical law of the
layer-dependent superconductivity in these quasi-two-dimensional
superconductors. From this, the Tc of a new monolayer superconductor can be
extrapolated.

<h3>Single-spin quantum sensing: A molecule-on-tip approach</h3>

<i>A. Fétida, O. Bengone, M. Romeo, F. Scheurer, R. Robles, N. Lorente, L. Limot</i>
<p>Quantum sensing is a key component of quantum technology, enabling highly
sensitive magnetometry. We combined a nickelocene molecule with scanning
tunneling microscopy to perform versatile spin sensing of magnetic surfaces,
namely of model Co islands on Cu(111) of different thickness. We demonstrate
that atomic-scale sensitivity to spin polarization and orientation is possible
due to direct exchange coupling between the Nc-tip and the Co surfaces. We find
that magnetic exchange maps lead to unique signatures, which are well described
by computed spin density maps. These advancements improve our ability to probe
magnetic properties at the atomic level.

<h3>Ground states of one-dimensional dipolar lattice bosons at unit filling</h3>

<br>
<i>Mateusz Łącki, Henning Korbmacher, G. A. Domínguez-Castro, Jakub Zakrzewski, Luis Santos</i>
<p>Recent experiments on ultracold dipoles in optical lattices open exciting
possibilities for the quantum simulation of extended Hubbard models. When
considered in one dimension, these models present at unit filling a
particularly interesting ground-state physics, including a symmetry-protected
topological phase known as Haldane insulator. We show that the tail of the
dipolar interaction beyond nearest-neighbors, which may be tailored by means of
the transversal confinement, does not only modify quantitatively the Haldane
insulator regime and lead to density waves of larger periods, but results as
well in unexpected insulating phases. These insulating phases may be
topological or topologically trivial, and are characterized by peculiar
correlations of the site occupations. These phases may be realized and observed
in state-of-the-art experiments.

<h3>Time-reversal-like degeneracies distinguished by the anomalous Hall  effect in a metallic kagome ice compound</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14626" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14626</a>
<br>
<i>Kan Zhao, Yoshi Tokiwa, Hua Chen, Philipp Gegenwart</i>
<p>In magnetic crystals, despite the explicit breaking of time-reversal
symmetry, two equilibrium states related by time reversal are always
energetically degenerate. In ferromagnets such time-reversal degeneracy can be
manifested by hysteresis loops in the magnetic field dependence of the
magnetization and, if metallic, in the anomalous Hall effect. Importantly, both
quantities simply change signs but not their absolute sizes under time
reversal, which follows from their fundamental definitions. Our integral
experimental and theoretical study shows that in the metallic kagome spin ice
HoAgGe subject to finite magnetic fields parallel to the kagome plane, an
emergent time-reversal-like degeneracy appears between magnetic states that
have the same energy and net magnetization, but different sizes of the
anomalous Hall effect. These degeneracies are unraveled by finite hysteresis in
the field-dependent anomalous Hall effect contrasted with the vanishing
hysteresis in the magnetization, which appears only at low-temperatures T$<$4K
when the kagome spin ice is fully ordered into $\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$
state. By explicitly determining the degenerate states and calculating the
corresponding physical properties using a tight-binding model, we nailed down
the time-reversal-like operation that transforms these degenerate states into
each other. The operation is related to the nontrivial distortion of the kagome
lattice in HoAgGe and is effective only because of the richness of degenerate
states unique to kagome spin ice. Our work points to the powerful role of the
anomalous Hall effect to diagnose hidden symmetries in frustrated spin systems.

<h3>Emergent Topology in Many-Body Dissipative Quantum Chaos</h3>

<i>Antonio M. García-García, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot, Can Yin</i>
<p>The identification, description, and classification of topological features
is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This
research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and
fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex
photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we
introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ fermions in zero dimensions with strong
$q$-body interactions coupled to a Markovian bath. For $q = 4, 8, \ldots$ and
certain choices of $N$ and bath details, involving pseudo-Hermiticity, we find
a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is
directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator
implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization,
the Liouvillian has purely real modes for any coupling to the bath. Some of
them are demonstrated to be topological by an explicit calculation of the
spectral flow, leading to a symmetry-dependent topological index $\nu$.
Topological properties have universal features: they are robust to changes in
the Liouvillian provided that the symmetries are respected and they are also
observed if the SYK model is replaced by a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain
in the same symmetry class. Moreover, the topological symmetry class can be
robustly characterized by the level statistics of the corresponding random
matrix ensemble. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes
govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for
experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic
systems.
