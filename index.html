<h3>Effects of linking topology on the shear response of connected ring  polymers: Catenanes and bonded rings flow differently</h3>

<i>Reyhaneh A. Farimani, Zahra Ahmadian Dehaghani, Christos N. Likos, Mohammad Reza Ejtehadi</i>
<p>We perform computer simulations of mechanically linked (poly[2]catenanes, PC)
and chemically bonded (bonded rings, BR) pairs of self-avoiding ring polymers
in steady shear. We find that BR's develop a novel motif, termed gradient
tumbling, rotating around the gradient axis. For the PC's the rings are
stretched and display another new pattern, termed slip-tumbling. The dynamics
of BR's is continuous and oscillatory, whereas that of PC's is intermittent
between slip-tumbling attempts. Our findings demonstrate the interplay between
topology and hydrodynamics in dilute solutions of connected polymers.

<p>Biological cells utilize membranes and liquid-like droplets, known as
biomolecular condensates, to structure their interior. The interaction of
droplets and membranes, despite being involved in several key biological
processes, is so far little-understood. Here, we present a first numerical
method to simulate the continuum dynamics of droplets interacting with
deformable membranes via wetting. The method combines the advantages of the
phase field method for multi-phase flow simulation and the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method for an explicit description of the elastic
surface. The model is thermodynamically consistent, coupling bulk hydrodynamics
with capillary forces, as well as bending, tension, and stretching of a thin
membrane. The method is validated by comparing simulations for single droplets
to theoretical results of shape equations, and its capabilities are illustrated
in 2D and 3D axisymmetric scenarios.

<h3>Hydrodynamic correlation and spectral functions of perfect cubic  crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01867" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01867</a>
<br>
<i>Joel Mabillard, Pierre Gaspard</i>
<p>We investigate the collective dynamics of the perfect cubic crystal by
deriving from the hydrodynamic equations the time-dependent correlation and the
spectral functions characterizing the fluctuations of mass and momentum
densities. We show that the seven hydrodynamic modes of the perfect crystal can
be identified from the resonances of these spectral functions. The comparison
with those of a fluid is discussed. Using the numerical values of the
thermodynamic, elastic, and transport coefficients computed in our previous
paper [J. Mabillard and P. Gaspard, arXiv:2311.00757 (2023)] for a system of
hard spheres, the theoretical expressions for the correlation and spectral
functions are compared to the same functions directly computed using molecular
dynamics simulations. The excellent agreement between theory and simulation
provides strong support for the microscopic hydrodynamic theory of perfect
crystals based on the local-equilibrium approach. This work sheds light on the
fundamental mechanisms governing the collective behavior of matter in the solid
state.

<h3>Modular extension of topological orders from congruence representations</h3>

<br>
<i>Donghae Seo, Minyoung You, Gil Young Cho, Hee-Cheol Kim</i>
<p>We present an efficient method to compute the modular extension of both
fermionic topological orders and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric bosonic topological
orders in two spatial dimensions, basing on congruence representations of
$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and its subgroups. To demonstrate the validity of
our approach, we provide explicit calculations for topological orders with rank
up to 10 for the fermionic cases and up to 6 for the bosonic cases. Along the
way, we clarify the relation between fermionic rational conformal field
theories, which live on the boundary of the corresponding fermionic topological
orders, and modular extensions. In particular, we show that the
$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ representation of the R-R sector can be determined
from the NS-NS sector using the modular extensions.

<h3>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00873</a>
<br>
<i>Simon Jiricek, Miroslav Hopjan, Patrycja Łydżba, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner, Lev Vidmar</i>
<p>It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at
eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that
exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit
scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the
initially localized states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a)
A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state
and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale
invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes a corresponding
recent result for survival probabilities [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023)
and arXiv:2309.16005]. These properties suggest that there is also critical
behavior in the quantum-quench dynamics of observables, which share the common
eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally
relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance we
numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions
in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e
model.

<h3>Effective field theory of Berry Landau Fermi liquid from the coadjoint  orbit method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00877" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00877</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoyang Huang</i>
<p>We follow Ref.[1] to construct an effective field theory for an interacting
Fermi liquid with nonzero Berry curvature at zero temperature, called the Berry
Landau Fermi liquid (Berry LFL). Like LFL, dynamics of Berry LFL are still
governed by incompressible evolutions of the distribution function on the
coadjoint orbit of the group of a modified canonical transformation. We compute
both linear and nonlinear electrical responses using the Kubo formula, and
identify those underexplored magnetization-current contributions to the static
($\omega/q\to 0$) Hall conductivity. We determine the anomalous Hall effect
caused by the Landau parameter that breaks parity and time-reversal symmetry.
The (non)linear anomalous Hall effect in the free fermion limit is confirmed
using the kinetic theory.

<h3>Significant four-phonon scattering and its heat transfer implications in  crystalline Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00895</a>
<br>
<i>Kanka Ghosh, Andrzej Kusiak, Jean-Luc Battaglia</i>
<p>We systematically demonstrate the temperature-dependent thermal transport
properties in crystalline Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$via first-principles density
functional theory-informed linearized Boltzmann transport equation. The
investigation, covering a wide temperature range (30 K-600 K), reports the
emergence of an unusual optical phonon-dominated thermal transport in
crystalline Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$. Further, a significant contribution of
four-phonon scattering is recorded which markedly alters the lattice thermal
conductivity. Therefore, the combined effect of cubic and quartic phonon
anharmonicity is seen to navigate the underlying physical mechanism and open up
intriguing phononic interactions in Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ at high temperature.
Irrespective of three and four-phonon processes, Umklapp is seen to prevail
over normal scattering events. Consequently, four-phonon scattering is found to
notably reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to 28
$\%$ at room temperature and 42 $\%$ at higher temperature. This quartic
anharmonicity further manifests in the breakdown of T$^{-1}$ scaling of thermal
conductivity and challenges the idea of a universal lower bound to phononic
thermal diffusivity at high temperature. The faster decay of thermal
diffusivity compared to T$^{-1}$ is rationalized encompassing the quartic
anharmonicity via a modified time scale. These results invoke better
understanding and precision to the theoretical prediction of thermal transport
properties of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$. Concomitantly, this also triggers the
possibility to explore the manifestations of the lower bound of thermal
diffusivity in materials possessing pronounced four-phonon scattering.

<h3>Dual Operation of Gate-All-Around Silicon Nanowires at Cryogenic  Temperatures: FET and Quantum Dot</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00903</a>
<br>
<i>C. Rohrbacher, J. Rivard, R. Ritzenthaler, B. Bureau, C. Lupien, H. Mertens, N. Horiguchi, E. Dupont-Ferrier</i>
<p>As CMOS structures are envisioned to host silicon spin qubits, and for
co-integrating quantum systems with their classical control blocks, the
cryogenic behaviour of such structures need to be investigated. In this paper
we characterize the electrical properties of Gate-All-Around (GAA) n-MOSFETs Si
nanowires (NWs) from room temperature down to 1.7 K. We demonstrate that those
devices can operate both as transistor and host quantum dots at cryogenic
temperature. In the classical regime of the transistor we show improved
performances of the devices and in the quantum regime we show systematic
quantum dots formation in GAA devices.

<h3>Flory-Huggins-Potts Framework for Thermoresponsive Polymer Solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00940" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00940</a>
<br>
<i>Satyen Dhamankar, Michael A. Webb</i>
<p>We introduce a lattice framework that incorporates elements of Flory-Huggins
solution theory and the $q$-state Potts model to study thermoresponsive polymer
solutions. Including orientation-dependent interactions within this
Flory-Huggins-Potts framework allows for competing energy scales and entropic
factors that ultimately recapitulate phenomena of upper critical solution
temperatures, miscibility loops, and hourglass-shaped spinodal curves without
resorting to temperature-dependent parameters. The phase behavior captured by
the framework is parametrically understood by mean-field analysis, and
single-chain Monte Carlo simulations reveal microscopic signatures, such as
heating-induced coil-globule transitions linked to energy fluctuations,
consistent with macroscopic phase transitions. This work provides new insights
regarding how thermoresponsiveness manifests in polymer solutions.

<h3>Facet and energy predictions in grain boundaries: lattice matching and  molecular dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00952</a>
<br>
<i>Bruno Dobrovolski, C. Braxton Owens, Gus L. W. Hart, Eric R. Homer, Brandon Runnels</i>
<p>Many material properties can be traced back to properties of their grain
boundaries. Grain boundary energy (GBE), as a result, is a key quantity of
interest in the analysis and modeling of microstructure. A standard method for
calculating grain boundary energy is molecular dynamics (MD); however,
on-the-fly MD calculations are not tenable due to the extensive computational
time required. Lattice matching (LM) is a reduced-order method for estimating
GBE quickly; however, it has only been tested against a relatively limited set
of data, and does not have a suitable means for assessing error. In this work,
we use the recently published dataset of Homer et al. [1] to assess the
performance of LM over the full range of GB space, and to equip LM with a
metric for error estimation. LM is used to generate energy estimates, along
with predictions of facet morphology, for each of the 7,304 boundaries in the
Homer dataset. In keeping with prior work, it is observed that LM predictions
of low energy boundaries matches well with MD results. Moreover, there is a
good general agreement between LM and MD, and it is apparent that the error
scales approximately linearly with the predicted energy value; this makes it
possible to establish an empirical estimate on error for future LM
calculations. An essential part of the LM method is the faceting relaxation,
which corrects the expected energy by convexification across the compact space
(S2) of boundary plane orientations. The original Homer dataset did not allow
for faceting, but upon extended annealing, it was shown that facet patterns
similar to those predicted by LM were emerging.

<h3>Polaronic polariton quasiparticles in a dark excitonic medium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00985" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00985</a>
<br>
<i>Kenneth Choo, Olivier Bleu, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish</i>
<p>Exciton polaritons are hybrid particles of excitons (bound electron-hole
pairs) and cavity photons, which are renowned for displaying Bose Einstein
condensation and other coherent phenomena at elevated temperatures. However,
their formation in semiconductor microcavities is often accompanied by the
appearance of an incoherent bath of optically dark excitonic states that can
interact with polaritons via their matter component. Here we show that the
presence of such a dark excitonic medium can "dress" polaritons with density
fluctuations to form coherent polaron-like quasiparticles, thus fundamentally
modifying their character. We employ a many-body Green's function approach that
naturally incorporates correlations beyond the standard mean-field theories
applied to this system. With increasing exciton density, we find a reduction in
the light-matter coupling that arises from the polaronic dressing cloud rather
than any saturation induced by the fermionic constituents of the exciton. In
particular, we observe the strongest effects when the spin of the polaritons is
opposite that of the excitonic medium. In this case, the coupling to light
generates an additional polaron quasiparticle - the biexciton polariton - which
emerges due to the dark-exciton counterpart of a polariton Feshbach resonance.
Our results can explain recent experiments on polariton interactions in
two-dimensional semiconductors and potentially provide a route to tailoring the
properties of exciton polaritons and their correlations.

<h3>Interplay between strain and size quantization in a class of topological  insulators based on inverted-band semiconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00986</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Khaetskii, Vitaly Golovach, Arnold Kiefer</i>
<p>We consider surface states in semiconductors with inverted-band structures,
such as $\alpha$-Sn and HgTe. The main interest is the interplay of the effect
of a strain of an arbitrary sign and that of the sample finite size. We clarify
the origin of various transitions which happen at a given strain with the
change of the sample thickness, in particular the transition between the Dirac
semimetal and quasi-3D (quantized) topological insulator. We compare our
results with the ones recently published in the literature.
For the k-p Kane model we derive effective boundary conditions in the case
when the direct band materials form high barriers for the carriers of the inner
inverted-band semiconductor (for example, CdTe/HgTe/CdTe and
CdTe/$\alpha$-Sn/CdTe cases). We show that in this case the BCs have an
universal and simple form which does not depend on the order of different
non-commuting operators in the Hamiltonian. Even in the limit of very high
barriers the BCs do not reduce to the trivial zero form, but contain the
information about the asymmetry of the offsets in the conduction and valence
bands. These boundary conditions allow to investigate the realistic case of
finite mass of the heavy hole band, and to compare the results obtained within
the Kane and the Luttinger models.

<h3>Mössbauer spectroscopy study of the magnetostructural and spin-state  transitions in the breathing pyrochlore LiFeCr$_{4}$O$_{8}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00996</a>
<br>
<i>Bo Zhang, Wei Ren, Shengyu Yang, Qifeng Kuang, Da Li, Xin Liu, Anmin Zhang, Hua Pang, Liyun Tang, Liang Qiao, Fashen Li, Zhiwei Li</i>
<p>We report on investigations of the complex magnetostructural and spin-state
transitions in the breathing pyrochlore LiFeCr$_{4}$O$_{8}$ by means of
magnetization, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Three transitions corresponding to the ferrimagnetic transition
at $T_N\sim94$ K, the spin-gap transition at $T_{SG}\sim50$ K, and the
magnetostructural transition at $T_{MS}\sim19$ K were observed from the
$\chi$(T) curve, whereas only $T_N$ and $T_{MS}$ were evidenced for the Fe site
from our M\"ossbauer measurements, suggesting that the spin-gap transition is
absent at the Fe site. This indicates that the spin-gap transition is an effect
of the breathing Cr$_4$ lattice, in agreement with our DFT calculations from
which we see nearly decoupled electronic states for the FeO$_4$ and CrO$_6$
units. From the temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field we also
observed a spin-state transition for the Fe spins at $T_{MS}$ consistent with
earlier neutron diffraction measurements. These local characteristics are
believed to be important for a complete understanding of the complex
magnetostructural coupling effects observed in similar systems.

<h3>High magnetic anisotropy and magnetocaloric effects in single crystal  Cr$_2$Te$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01000" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01000</a>
<br>
<i>Anirban Goswami, Nicholas Ng, AM Milinda Abeykoon, Emmanuel Yakubu, Samaresh Guchhait</i>
<p>We report a systematic investigation of anisotropic magnetocaloric effects in
single crystal Cr$_2$Te$_3$. Single crystal samples are synthesized by chemical
vapor transport and characterized by x-ray and Laue diffraction methods. The
maximum magnetic entropy change $-\Delta S_{\text M}^{\text{max}}$ is 4.50 J
kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for the easy c-axis (3.36 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for the hard
ab-plane) and the relative cooling power RCP is 296.7 J kg$^{-1}$ for the easy
c-axis (183.84 J kg$^{-1}$ for the hard axis ab-plane) near the Curie
temperature for a magnetic field change of 9 T. The magneto-crystalline
anisotropy constant K$_u$ is estimated to be 486.92 kJ m$^{-3}$ at 146 K,
decreasing to 148.60 kJ m$^{-3}$ at 168 K. Meanwhile, the maximum of the
rotational magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_{\text M}^{\text R}(T, H)$ between
the c-axis and the ab-plane is about 1.14 J kg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for
magnetic-field change of 9 T. The critical exponents are estimated by analyzing
magnetocaloric effects, which indicate 2D-Ising type magnetic system. The
accuracy of estimated critical exponents is verified by scaling analysis. The
maximum magnetic entropy change $-\Delta S_{\text M}^{\text{max}}$
$\approx$5.25 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ (along the c-axis) and the corresponding
adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{\text{ad}}$ $\approx$3.31 K (along the
c-axis) are estimated by analyzing heat capacity measurements with a magnetic
field up to 9 Tesla.

<h3>Molecular beam epitaxy growth of superconducting tantalum germanide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01038" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01038</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick J. Strohbeen, Aurelia M. Brook, Ido Levy, Wendy L. Sarney, Jechiel van Dijk, Hayden Orth, Melissa Mikalsen, Javad Shabani</i>
<p>Developing new material platforms for use in superconductor-semiconductor
hybrid structures is desirable due to limitations caused by intrinsic microwave
losses present in commonly used III/V material systems. With the recent reports
that tantalum provides drastic improvements when implemented in superconducting
circuit elements over traditional Nb and Al films, exploring Ta as an
alternative superconductor in hybrid material systems seems necessary. Here, we
present our study on the growth of Ta on semiconducting Ge (001) substrates
grown via molecular beam epitaxy. We show that the Ta diffuses into the Ge
matrix in a self-limiting nature resulting in extremely smooth and abrupt
surfaces and interfaces that are ideal for future cQED device fabrication. The
films have a nominal composition of TaGe$_{2}$ and form a native oxide of
nominal composition Ta$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$O$_{5}$ that also forms a sharp interface
with the underlying film. These films are superconducting with a $T_{C}\sim
1.8-2$K and $H_{C}^{\perp} \sim 1.88T$, $H_{C}^{\parallel} \sim 5.1T$.

<h3>Topological spin textures in electronic non-Hermitian systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01041" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01041</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao-Xiao Zhang, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<p>Non-Hermitian systems have been discussed mostly in the context of open
systems and nonequilibrium. Recent experimental progress is much from optical,
cold-atomic, and classical platforms due to the vast tunability and clear
identification of observables. However, their counterpart in solid-state
electronic systems in equilibrium remains unmasked although highly desired,
where a variety of materials are available, calculations are solidly founded,
and accurate spectroscopic techniques can be applied. We demonstrate that, in
the surface state of a topological insulator with spin-dependent relaxation due
to magnetic impurities, highly nontrivial topological soliton spin textures
appear in momentum space. Such spin-channel phenomena are delicately related to
the type of non-Hermiticity and correctly reveal the most robust non-Hermitian
features detectable spectroscopically. Moreover, the distinct topological
soliton objects can be deformed to each other, mediated by topological
transitions driven by tuning across a critical direction of doped magnetism.
These results not only open a solid-state avenue to exotic spin patterns via
spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, but also inspire
non-Hermitian dissipation engineering of spins in solids.

<h3>Universal thermodynamic bounds on the Fano factor of discriminatory  networks with unidirectional transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01051</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas Berx, Karel Proesmans</i>
<p>We derive a universal lower bound on the Fano factors of general biochemical
discriminatory networks involving irreversible catalysis steps, based on the
thermodynamic uncertainty relation, and compare it to a numerically exact
Pareto optimal front. This bound is completely general, involving only the
reversible entropy production per product formed and the error fraction of the
system. We then show that by judiciously choosing which transitions to include
in the reversible entropy production, one can derive a family of bounds that
can be fine-tuned to include physical observables at hand. Lastly, we test our
bound by considering three discriminatory schemes: a multi-stage
Michaelis-Menten network, a Michaelis-Menten network with correlations between
subsequent products, and a multi-stage kinetic proofreading network, where for
the latter application the bound is altered to include the hydrolytic cost of
the proofreading steps. We find that our bound is remarkably tight.

<h3>Thermodynamics of formation of multi-component CdZnTeSe solid solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01095" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01095</a>
<br>
<i>Sergei Naydenov, Igor Pritula</i>
<p>A thermodynamic model of formation of multi-component solid solutions as a
thermodynamic mixture of their binary components, is proposed. There are
obtained expressions for the effective temperature of the equilibrium state of
the solid solution of binary components, and for the excess Gibbs energy of
formation of such a solution. The thermodynamic parameters of formation of
solid solutions are calculated for CdZnTeSe compounds with an arbitrary
concentration of the doping elements. There is revealed a new thermodynamic
effect of a decrease in the excess Gibbs energy in the solid solutions which
contain mixed binary components formed during simultaneous doping of the
cationic and anionic subsystems. Such an effect is connected with emergence of
strong covalent bonds in the mixed binary component ZnSe which is a part of the
quaternary solid solution. This may explain a considerable decrease in the
number of extended defects observed at the growth of CdZnTeSe crystals. The
proposed theory allows different generalizations, and makes it possible to
quantitively predict changes of the expected defect quality of the crystals at
variations in the composition of the solid solutions.

<h3>Interplay of topology and antiferromagnetic order in two-dimensional van  der Waals crystals of (NixFe1-x)2P2S6</h3>

<br>
<i>N. Khan, D. Kumar, V. Kumar, Y. Shemerliuk, S. Selter, B. Büchner, K. Pal, S. Aswartham, Pradeep Kumar</i>
<p>Mermin-Wagner theorem forbid spontaneous symmetry breaking of spins in
one/two-dimensional systems at finite temperature and rules out the
stabilization of this ordered state. However, it does not apply to all types of
phase transitions in low dimensions such as topologically ordered phase
rigorously shown by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and experimentally
realized in very limited systems such as superfluids, superconducting thin
films. Quasi 2D van der Waals magnets provide an ideal platform to investigate
the fundamentals of low-dimensional magnetism. We explored the 2D honeycomb
antiferromagnetic single crystals of (NixFe1-x)2P2S6 with varying spins ( )
using in depth temperature dependent Raman measurements supported by
first-principles calculations of the phonon frequencies. As a function of
doping, a tunable transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering is
shown via phonons reflected in the strong renormalization of the self-energy
parameters of the Raman active phonon modes. An anomalously broad magnetic
continuum attributed to two-magnon excitations is observed and its coupling
with the phonons is revealed in the observation a Fano line asymmetry.
Interestingly, the two-magnon continuum is observed only for the finite doping
understood invoking underlying nature of insulator these materials belongs to,
i.e. exchange interaction between transition metals via surrounding ligands
(sulphur) and the resonance involving phonon modes associated with the (P2S6)
cage. Quite surprisingly, we also observed renormalization of the phonon modes
much below the long-range magnetic ordered temperature attributed to the
topological ordered state, namely the BKT phase, which is also found to change
as a function of doping. The extracted critical exponent of the order-parameter

<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01102</a>
<br>
<i>S. Dahri, A. Jabar, L. Bahmad, L. B. Drissi, R. Ahl Laamara</i>
<p>In this study, we investigate the electronic, optical, thermoelectric, and
thermodynamic properties of Ca(InP)2 through comprehensive theoretical
calculations Ca(InP)2 is a compound with promising applications in materials
science and electronics. Using the density functional theory (DFT) with
Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and modified Becke_Johnson
approximation (mBJ), we determine the band structure, density of states, and
optical properties of Ca(InP)2. The obtained results reveal that the Ca(InP)2
compound exhibits a direct band gap of 0 eV and 0,645 eV for PBE-GGA and
GGA+mBJ, respectively. This direct band gap is found at the Gamma point of the
Brillouin zone, making it well-suited for optoelectronic applications.
Furthermore, we analyze the thermoelectric properties such as the Seebeck
coefficient, the lattice thermal conductivity, and optical properties like
dielectric function, absorption coefficient, conductivity, and extinction
coefficient. Thermodynamic properties, including heat capacity and Debye
temperature, are also calculated, providing a deeper understanding of the
compound's thermal behavior. The findings of this study highlight the
fundamental characteristics of Ca(InP)2 and offer valuable information for its
potential use in electronic and optoelectronic devices. A comprehensive
understanding of the electronic, optical, and thermodynamic properties of the
Ca(InP)2 compound can serve as a guide for future experimental research and aid
in the design of novel materials for a wide range of technological
applications.

<h3>Identifying Majorana Zero Modes in Vortex Lattices Using Fano Factor  Tomography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01108</a>
<br>
<i>Jiong Mei, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu</i>
<p>In this work, we investigate the tunneling characteristics of Majorana zero
modes (MZMs) in vortex lattices based on scanning tunneling microscopy
measurement. We find that zero bias conductance does not reach the quantized
value owing to the coupling between the MZMs. On the contrary, the Fano factor
measured in the high voltage regime reflects the local particle-hole asymmetry
of the bound states and is insensitive to the energy splitting between them. We
propose using spatially resolved Fano factor tomography as a tool to identify
the existence of MZMs. In both cases of isolated MZM or MZMs forming bands,
there is a spatially resolved Fano factor plateau at one in the vicinity of a
vortex core, regardless of the tunneling parameter details, which is in stark
contrast to other trivial bound states. These results reveal new tunneling
properties of MZMs in vortex lattices and provide measurement tools for
topological quantum devices.

<h3>Electroosmotic Flow in Different Phosphorus Nanochannels</h3>

<br>
<i>S. M. Kazem Manzoorolajdad, Hossein Hamzehpour, Jalal Sarabadani</i>
<p>The electrokinetic transport in a neutral system consists of an aqueous NaCl
solution confined in a nanochannel with two similar parallel phosphorene walls,
and is investigated for different black, blue, red, and green phosphorene
allotropes in the presence of an external electric field in the directions $x$
(parallel to the walls roughness axis) and $y$ (perpendicular to the walls
roughness axis). The results show that irrespective of the electric field
direction, the thickness of the Stern layer increases with the increase in the
magnitude of the negative electric surface charge density (ESCD) on the
nanochannel walls, and it also increases with the increase in the roughness
ratio for different allotropes. Moreover, three different regimes of
Debye--H\"{u}ckel (DH), intermediate, and flow reversal appear as the absolute
value of the negative ESCD on the walls grows. With the increase in the
absolute value of the negative ESCD, in the DH regime, the flow velocity grows,
then in the intermediate regime, it decreases, and finally, at sufficiently
high ESCD, the flow reversal occurs. When the external electric field is
applied in the $y$ direction, the dynamics of the system are slower than that
of the $x$ direction; therefore, the flow reversal occurs at the smaller
absolute values of the negative ESCD.

<h3>Potential reversible hydrogen storage in Li-decorated carbon allotrope  PAI-Graphene: A first-principles study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01144" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01144</a>
<br>
<i>Vikram Mahamiya, Alok Shukla, Brahmananda Chakraborty</i>
<p>Two-dimensional porous carbon nanomaterials are proven to be promising
hydrogen storage substrates as they possess high surface area, large number of
active sites, low molecular mass, and hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed on
both sides of these materials. By performing first-principles density
functional theory-based calculations, we report ultrahigh reversible hydrogen
uptake in lithium decorated 2D carbon allotrope PAI-graphene, which is formed
of a regular pattern of polymerized as-indacenes (PAI). We found that a single
unit cell of PAI-graphene can be decorated by 8 Li atoms, in which each Li atom
can reversibly adsorb 4 hydrogen molecules, leading to 15.7 % of H uptake,
remarkably higher than the DOE demand of 6.5 %. Li atom donates its valence
2s-electron to PAI-graphene and gets ionized. The adsorption energies of the
various H2 attached to Li-atom are found to be suitable for reversible use
during practical applications. Hydrogen molecules get attached to the ionized
metal atom by electrostatic interactions. An energy barrier of 1.48 eV is
present for the diffusion of Li atoms between the two most stable adsorption
sites which justifies the absence of the clustering of Li atoms.

<h3>Record statistics based prediction of fracture in the random spring  network model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01158</a>
<br>
<i>Subrat Senapati, Subhadeep Roy, Anuradha Banerjee, R.Rajesh</i>
<p>We study the role of record statistics of damage avalanches in predicting the
fracture of a heterogeneous material under tensile loading. The material is
modeled using a two-dimensional random spring network where disorder is
introduced through randomness in the breakage threshold strains of the springs.
It is shown that the waiting time between successive records of avalanches has
a maximum for moderate disorder, thus showing an acceleration of records with
impending fracture. Such a signature is absent for low disorder strength when
the fracture is nucleation-dominated, and high disorder strength when the
fracture is percolation type. We examine the correlation between the record
with the maximum waiting time and the crossover record at which the avalanche
statistics change from off-critical to critical. Compared to the avalanche
based predictor for failure, we show that the record statistics have the
advantage of both being real-time as well as able to predict final fracture at
much smaller strains. We also show that in the avalanche-dominated regime, the
failure strain is shown to have a linear relation with the strain at the
maximum waiting time, making possible a quantitative prediction.

<i>Zeqing Wang, Ran Qi</i>
<p>Motivated by experiments of interacting quantum gases across high partial
wave resonance, we investigated the thermodynamic properties as well as single
particle spectrums of Bose gases in normal phase for different interaction
strengths both for $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. The free energy, contact
density, momentum distributions, and self-energies of single particle Green's
functions are obtained in the spirit of ladder diagram approximations. Radio
frequency (RF) spectrum, as an important experimental approach to detect
Feshbach molecules or interaction effect, is calculated at different
temperatures. A reversed temperature dependence on the BEC side and BCS side is
identified for both $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. An estimation for the
signal of RF spectra under typical experimental conditions is also provided.

<br>
<i>David Hathcock, Sam Dillavou, Jesse M. Hanlan, Douglas J. Durian, Yuhai Tu</i>
<p>Granular flows in small-outlet hoppers exhibit intermittent clogging
behavior: while a temporary clog (pause) can last for an extended period before
flow spontaneously restarts, there are also permanent clogs that last beyond
experimental timescales. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model with
multiplicative noise that provides a dynamical explanation for these extreme
events: they arise due to coupling between the flow rate and a slow hidden mode
that controls the stability of clogs. The theory fully resolves the statistics
of pause and clog events, including the non-exponential clogging times and
non-Gaussian flow rate distribution and explains the stretched-exponential
growth of the average clogging time with outlet size. Our work provides a
framework for extracting features of granular flow dynamics from experimental
trajectories.

<h3>Topological defect formation in a phase transition with tunable order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01259</a>
<br>
<i>Fumika Suzuki, Wojciech H. Zurek</i>
<p>The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and
topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase
transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and
condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing
first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in
systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as
second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence
of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase
transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second
order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects
in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be
predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

<h3>Gate-Tunable Berry Curvature Dipole Polarizability in Dirac Semimetal  Cd3As2</h3>

<br>
<i>Tong-Yang Zhao, An-Qi Wang, Xing-Guo Ye, Xing-Yu Liu, Xin Liao, Zhi-Min Liao</i>
<p>We reveal the gate-tunable Berry curvature dipole polarizability in Dirac
semimetal Cd3As2 nanoplates through measurements of the third-order nonlinear
Hall effect. Under an applied electric field, the Berry curvature exhibits an
asymmetric distribution, forming a field-induced Berry curvature dipole,
resulting in a measurable third-order Hall voltage with a cubic relationship to
the longitudinal electric field. Notably, the magnitude and polarity of this
third-order nonlinear Hall effect can be effectively modulated by gate
voltages. Furthermore, our scaling relation analysis demonstrates that the sign
of the Berry curvature dipole polarizability changes when tuning the Fermi
level across the Dirac point, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The
results highlight the gate control of nonlinear quantum transport in Dirac
semimetals, paving the way for promising advancements in topological
electronics.

<p>The nonvolatile magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) is believed to
facilitate emerging applications, such as in memory computing, neuromorphic
computing and stochastic computing. Two dimensional (2D) materials and their
van der Waals heterostructures promote the development of MRAM technology, due
to their atomically smooth interfaces and tunable physical properties. Here we
report the all-2D magnetoresistive memories featuring all electrical data
reading and writing at room temperature based on WTe2/Fe3GaTe2/BN/Fe3GaTe2
heterostructures. The data reading process relies on the tunnel
magnetoresistance of Fe3GaTe2/BN/Fe3GaTe2. The data writing is achieved through
current induced polarization of orbital magnetic moments in WTe2, which exert
torques on Fe3GaTe2, known as the orbit transfer torque (OTT) effect. In
contrast to the conventional reliance on spin moments in spin transfer torque
and spin orbit torque, the OTT effect leverages the natural out of plane
orbital moments, facilitating field-free perpendicular magnetization switching
through interface currents. Our results indicate that the emerging OTT MRAM is
promising for low power, high performance memory applications.

<p>The manipulation of spin-phonon coupling in both formations and explorations
of magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnetic semiconductors
facilitates unprecedented prospects for spintronics devices. The interlayer
engineering tunes spin-phonon coupling significantly and holds the promise for
controllable magnetism via organic cation intercalation. Here, we present
spectroscopic evidence to reveal the intercalation effect on intrinsic magnetic
and electronic transitions in quasi-two-dimensional Cr2Ge2Te6 using tetrabutyl
ammonium as the intercalant. The temperature-evolution of Raman modes E_g^3 and
A_g^1, along with the magnetization measurements, unambiguously captures the
enhancement of the ferromagnetic Curie temperature in the intercalated
heterostructure. Moreover, the E_g^4 mode highlighted the increased effect of
spin-phonon interaction in magnetic order-induced lattice distortion. Combined
with the first-principle calculations, we observed a substantial number of
electrons transferred from TBA+ to Cr through the interface. These results
provide the interplay between spin-phonon coupling and magnetic ordering in van
der Waals magnets where Raman fingerprints would be highly beneficial for
further understanding the manipulation of magnetism in layered
heterostructures.

<h3>Electronic properties of nickelate superconductor R3Ni2O7 with oxygen  vacancies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01271</a>
<br>
<i>Xuelei Sui, Xiangru Han, Xiaojun Chen, Liang Qiao, Xiaohong Shao, Bing Huang</i>
<p>The discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 has attracted significant
research interest in the field of nickelate superconductors. Despite extensive
studies on pristine La3Ni2O7, the impact of oxygen vacancies (VO), a common
type of intrinsic defect in oxides, on electronic structures and
superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. In this article, we identify the
most energetically favorable location for VO formation as the oxygen atom
connecting the NiO6 bilayer, resulting in a significant reduction in the
lattice constant along the c-axis. Interestingly, the electronic structure
undergoes notable changes, particularly for the Ni dz2 and Ni dx2-y2 orbitals.
The Ni dz2 orbitals change from partially filled in the pristine La3Ni2O7 to
completely filled in the presence of VO, leading to a considerable decrease of
its proportion near the Fermi level. Conversely, the proportion of Ni dx2-y2
states increases due to the orbital localization and slight upward shift.
Additionally, we observe a significant increase in the hopping of intra-bilayer
Ni dz2 orbitals when the VO exists, but with an opposite sign, which differs
greatly from the previous understanding. The inter-orbital hopping between Ni
dz2 and Ni dx2-y2 orbitals also changes its sign in the presence of VO. Our
results indicate that the formation of VO may be harmful to the
superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, given the general assumption for the critical
role of Ni dz2 in generating superconductivity. Furthermore, we suggest that
Ce3Ni2O7, which shares similar electronic structures to La3Ni2O7 but has a
larger lattice volume, may be a better candidate for nickelate superconductor
due to its lower VO concentration.

<h3>Impact of density inhomogeneity on the critical velocity for vortex  shedding in a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01289" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01289</a>
<br>
<i>Haruya Kokubo, Kenichi Kasamatsu</i>
<p>We report on a numerical study of the critical velocity for creation of
quantized vortices by a moving Gaussian obstacle in a trapped Bose-Einstein
condensate, modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We pay attention to
impact of density inhomogeneity associated with the global inverted-parabolic
profile by a trapping potential as well as the local density suppression around
the Gaussian obstacle. When the width of the Gaussian potential is large, the
wake dynamics is significantly influenced by the nonuniformity around the
obstacle potential. The critical velocity, estimated through the time interval
between the first and second vortex emission, can be explained by the local
sound velocity by taking into account the above two contributions. We also find
that the ratio of the critical velocity to the sound velocity at the center of
the system is insensitive to the nonlinear coefficient of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, which supports the universal discussion even in a inhomogeneous
trapped condensate under the local density approximation.

<h3>Evolutionary search for superconducting phases in the  lanthanum-nitrogen-hydrogen system with universal neural network potential</h3>

<i>Takahiro Ishikawa, Yuta Tanaka, Shinji Tsuneyuki</i>
<p>Recently, Grockowiak $\textit{et al.}$ reported "hot superconductivity" in
ternary or multinary compounds based on lanthanum hydride [A. D. Grockowiak
$\textit{et al.}$, Front. Electron. Mater. $\textbf{2}$, 837651 (2022)]. In
this paper, we explored thermodynamically stable phases and superconducting
phases in the lanthanum-nitrogen-hydrogen system (La$_{x}$N$_{y}$H$_{1-x-y}$,
$0 \leq x \leq 1$, $0 \leq y \leq 1$) at pressure of 20$\,$GP. We rapidly and
accurately constructed the formation-enthalpy convex hull using an evolutionary
construction scheme based on density functional theory calculations, extracting
the candidates for stable and moderately metastable compounds by the universal
neural network potential calculations. The convex hull diagram shows that more
than fifty compounds emerge as stable and moderately metastable phases in the
region of $\Delta H \leq 4.4$$\,$mRy/atom. In particular, the compounds are
concentrated on the line of $x = 0.5$ connecting between LaH and LaN. We found
that the superconductivity is gradually enhanced due to N doping for LaH and
the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ reaches 8.77$\,$K in
La$_2$NH with $y = 0.25$. In addition, we predicted that metastable
La$_2$NH$_2$ shows the highest $T_{\rm c}$ value, 14.41$\,$K, of all the
ternary compounds predicted in this study. These results suggest that it is
difficult to obtain the hot superconductivity in the La-H compounds with N at
20$\,$GPa.

<p>Strange correlators are useful tools for diagnosing symmetry-protected
topological states from their bulk wave functions. We study strange correlators
for one-dimensional fermionic symmetry-protected topological states using
fixed-point wave functions, and show that a combination of strange correlators
constructed using fermion annihilation operators and bosonic order parameters
can fully diagnose the classification from such wave functions. By converting
the strange correlator to a correlation in a one-dimensional statistical
problem described by transfer matrices, we show that when the wave function is
topologically nontrivial, the corresponding strange correlator exhibits a
long-range-order behavior, which can be analyzed from the symmetry properties
of the transfer matrices constructed from the fixed-point wave function. Our
general argument is demonstrated by several concrete examples.

<p>Stereochemically active lone-pair (SCALP) cations are attractive units for
realizing optical anisotropy. Antimony (III) chloride perovskites with SCALP
have remained largely unknown till date. We synthesized vacancy ordered
Cs3Sb2Cl9 perovskite single crystals with SbCl6 octahedral linkage containing
SCALP. Remarkably, Cs3Sb2Cl9 single crystals exhibit an exceptional
birefringence of 0.12 +(-) 0.01 at 550 nm, which is the largest among pristine
all-inorganic halide perovskites. The SCALP brings a large local structural
distortion of the SbCl6 octahedra promoting birefringence optical responses in
Cs3Sb2Cl9 single crystals. Theoretical calculations reveal that the
considerable hybridization of Sb 5s with Sb 5p and Cl 3p states largely
contribute to the SCALP. Furthermore, the change in the Sb-Cl-Sb bond angle
creates distortion in the SbCl6 octahedral arrangement in the apical and
equatorial directions within the crystal structure incorporating the required
anisotropy for the birefringence. This work explores pristine inorganic halide
perovskite single crystals as a potential birefringent material with prospects
in integrated optical devices.

<p>Bernal-Fowler ice rules govern the phase behaviors of crystalline bulk water
by stipulating that each water molecule forms four hydrogen bonds. However, in
extreme or constrained conditions, the arrangement of water molecules deviates
from conventional ice rules, resulting in properties significantly different
from bulk water. In this study, we employ machine learning-driven
first-principles simulations to observe a unique violation of the ice rules in
a monolayer of water confined within a hydrophobic channel. We observe a
quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure in a flat-rhombic phase. This
phase consists of strongly hydrogen-bonded linear chains of water molecules
that zig-zag along one dimension, stabilized by van der Waals interactions that
stack these chains along the other dimension. This arrangement of strong and
weak bonds bears similarities with a new class of functional materials called
quasi-one-dimensional van der Waals materials. The unusual interplay of
hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in flat-rhombic ice results in
atypical proton disorder, including long-range proton ordering and coherent
proton dynamics. Our work sets the stage for discovering new
confinement-induced low-dimensional hydrogen-bonded materials and exploiting
their electronic, vibronic, and optical properties in ways analogous to
quasi-one-dimensional van der Waals materials.

<h3>Superconductivity in Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene: C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<i>Jin-Han Tan, Hao Wang, Ying-Jie Chen, Na Jiao, Meng-Meng Zheng, Hong-Yan Lu, Ping Zhang</i>
<p>The deposition and intercalation of metal atoms can induce superconductivity
in monolayer and bilayer graphenes. For example, it has been experimentally
proved that Li-deposited graphene is a superconductor with critical temperature
$T_{c}$ of 5.9 K, Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene C$_{6}$CaC$_{6}$ and
K-intercalated epitaxial bilayer graphene C$_{8}$KC$_{8}$ are superconductors
with $T_{c}$ of 2-4 K and 3.6 K, respectively. However, the $T_{c}$ of them are
relatively low. To obtain higher $T_{c}$ in graphene-based superconductors,
here we predict a new Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$, which
shows higher Ca concentration than the C$_{6}$CaC$_{6}$. It is proved to be
thermodynamically and dynamically stable. The electronic structure,
electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and superconductivity of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ are
investigated based on first-principles calculations. The EPC of
C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ mainly comes from the coupling between the electrons of
C-$p_{z}$ orbital and the high- and low-frequency vibration modes of C atoms.
The calculated EPC constant $\lambda$ of C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ is 0.75, and the
superconducting $T_{c}$ is 18.9 K, which is much higher than other
metal-intercalated bilayer graphenes. By further applying -4\% biaxial
compressive strain to C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$, the $T_{c}$ can be boosted to 26.6 K.
Thus, the predicted C$_{2}$CaC$_{2}$ provides a new platform for realizing
superconductivity with the highest $T_{c}$ in bilayer graphenes.

<p>A new apparatus has been developed to measure the conductivity of rock

doesn't require physical contact with the samples. The measurement is based on
the induction principle. The measurement system is validated by using saline

details of the development of a system of magnetic resistivity measurements by
magnetic induction for petrophysical applications. The first application
consists of measuring the resistivity of the core plug which is 0.038 m in
diameter. Currently the system is operating properly at a frequency of 50 kHz
with a current of up to 500 mA at 20 {\deg}C. During the study two types of
samples were investigated: aqueous solutions with conductivities between 1 to
100 mS/cm and rocks. Several tests were carried out with the objective of
investigating the performance of the instrument, such as the experiment to
obtain sensitivity for the measurement system as a function of the current
applied to the transmitter coil.

were grown by the high-pressure Bridgman method covering the range of its

correlations between the composition of solid solution crystals of
$Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te:Fe^{2+}$, band gap, lattice period and the maxima positions
of the $Fe^{2+}$ active ion absorption and emission spectra were found. A new
theoretical model based on the principle of additivity for solid solution
semiconductor materials has been used for explaining the long-wavelength
''redshift'' of absorption and luminescence bands in the spectra of
$Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te:Fe^{2+}$ crystals with increasing solid solution
concentration. The obtained results can be used to predict the lasing range for
$Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te:Fe^{2+}$ crystal media (in all possible $Mn$ concentrations),
which is potentially the longest wavelength active material for mid-IR lasing.

<p>Here, we quantitatively estimate the impact of the inevitable Si surface

initial substrate, and explore its consequences for the description of wetting
properties. Density Functional Theory is used to determine absolute surface
energies of P- and Ga-passivated Si surfaces and their dependencies with the
chemical potential. Especially, we show that, while a ~90 meV/$\r{A}^2$ surface
energy is usually considered for the nude Si surface, surface passivation by
Ga- or P- atoms leads to a strong stabilization of the surface, with a surface
energy in the [50-75 meV/$\r{A}^2$] range. The all-ab initio analysis of the
wetting properties indicate that a complete wetting situation would become
possible only if the initial passivated Si surface could be destabilized by at
least 15 meV/$\r{A}^2$ or if the III-V (001) surface could be stabilized by the

<br>
<i>Gianmarco Perrupato, Tommaso Rizzo</i>
<p>The statics of the Fredrickson-Andersen model (FAM) of the liquid-glass
transition is solved on the Bethe lattice (BL). The kinetic constraints of the
FAM imply on the BL an ergodicity-breaking transition to a (glassy) phase where
a fraction of spins of the system is permanently blocked, and the remaining
"free" spins become non-trivially correlated. We compute several observables of
the ergodicity-broken phase, such as the self-overlap, the configurational
entropy and the spin-glass susceptibility, and we compare the analytical
predictions with numerical experiments. The cavity equations that we obtain
allow to define algorithms for fast equilibration and accelerated dynamics. We
find that at variance with spin-glass models, the correlations inside a state
do not exhibit a critical behavior.

<p>The evolution of the critical superconducting temperature and field, quantum
oscillation frequencies and effective mass $m^{*}$ in underdoped
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) crystals ($p$ = 0.11, with $p$ the hole
concentration per Cu atom) points to a partial suppression of the charge orders
with increasing pressure up to 7 GPa, mimicking doping. Application of
pressures up to 25 GPa pushes the sample to the overdoped side of the
superconducting dome. Contrary to other cuprates, or to doping studies on YBCO,
the frequency of the quantum oscillations measured in that pressure range do
not support the picture of a Fermi-surface reconstruction in the overdoped
regime, but possibly point to the existence of a new charge order.

<p>We use molecular dynamics simulations with machine-learned atomistic force
fields to simulate photoexcitation of BaTiO3 by a femtosecond laser pulse whose
photon energy exceeds the optical gap. We demonstrate selective displacive
excitation of coherent zone-center ferroelectric mode phonons and of the
strongly anharmonic central mode. We show that the direction of P can either be
reversed by a pulse in hundreds of femtoseconds or, on a longer time scale and
when combined with a weak field, switched to any one of its symmetry-equivalent

<h3>Yielding behaviour of active particles in bulk and in confinement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01459</a>
<br>
<i>Yagyik Goswami, G. V. Shivashankar, Srikanth Sastry</i>
<p>The investigation of collective behaviour in dense assemblies of
self-propelled active particles has been motivated by a wide range of
biological phenomena. Of particular interest are dynamical transitions of
cellular and sub-cellular biological assemblies, including the cytoskeleton and
the cell nucleus. Motivated by observations of mechanically induced changes in
the dynamics of such systems, and the apparent role of confinement geometry, we
study the transition between jammed and fluidized states of active particles
assemblies, as a function of the strength and temporal persistence of active
forces, and in different confinement geometries. Our results show that the
fluidization transition broadly resembles yielding in amorphous solids,
consistently with recent suggestions. More specifically, however, we find that
a detailed analogy holds with the yielding transition under cyclic shear
deformation, for finite persistence times. The fluidization transition is
accompanied by driving induced annealing, strong dependence on the initial
state of the system, a divergence of time scales to reach steady states, and a
discontinuous onset of diffusive motion. We also observe a striking dependence
of the transition on persistence times and on the nature of the confinement.
Collectively, our results have implications in epigenetic cell state
transitions induced by alterations in confinement geometry.

<h3>Spin-fluctuation heat capacity at magnetic phase transition in the Co,Fe  doped MnSi</h3>

<p>An universal line revealing an independence of spin fuctuation contributions
to the heat capacity on impurity content and its nature is discovered in the
helical phase of Mn(Co,Fe)Si. This situation declares an invariance of the heat
capacity of spin subsystem under doping, which probably arises as a result of
relative stiffness of the helical spin structure in respect to the impurity
spins. On the other hand the situation drastically changes at the helical
fuctuation region when no long range spin order exists.

<h3>Heisenberg machines with programmable spin-circuits</h3>

<br>
<i>Saleh Bunaiyan, Supriyo Datta, Kerem Y. Camsari</i>
<p>We show that we can harness two recent experimental developments to build a
compact hardware emulator for the classical Heisenberg model in statistical
physics. The first is the demonstration of spin-diffusion lengths in excess of
microns in graphene even at room temperature. The second is the demonstration
of low barrier magnets (LBMs) whose magnetization can fluctuate rapidly even at
sub-nanosecond rates. Using experimentally benchmarked circuit models, we show
that an array of LBMs driven by an external current source has a steady-state
distribution corresponding to a classical system with an energy function of the
form $E = -1/2\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} (\hat{m}_i \cdot \hat{m}_j$). This may seem
surprising for a non-equilibrium system but we show that it can be justified by
a Lyapunov function corresponding to a system of coupled
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations. The Lyapunov function we construct
describes LBMs interacting through the spin currents they inject into the spin
neutral substrate. We suggest ways to tune the coupling coefficients $J_{ij}$
so that it can be used as a hardware solver for optimization problems involving
continuous variables represented by vector magnetizations, similar to the role
of the Ising model in solving optimization problems with binary variables.
Finally, we implement a Heisenberg AND gate based on a network of three coupled
stochastic LLG equations, illustrating the concept of probabilistic computing
with a programmable Heisenberg model.

<p>The photoinduced switching of Fe(II)-based spin-crossover complexes from
singlet to quintet takes place at ultrafast time scales. This a priori
spin-forbidden transition triggered numerous time-resolved experiments of
solvated samples to elucidate the mechanism at play. The involved intermediate
states remain uncertain. We apply ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy in molecular
films as a method sensitive to spin, electronic, and nuclear degrees of
freedom. Combining the progress in molecule synthesis and film growth with the
opportunities at x-ray free-electron lasers, we analyze the transient evolution
of the Fe L3 fine structure at room temperature. Our measurements and
calculations indicate the involvement of an Fe triplet intermediate state. The
high-spin state saturates at half of the available molecules, limited by
molecule-molecule interaction within the film.

<h3>Flat band projections: Sign problem mapping for frustrated spin systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Maksim Ulybyshev, Anika Götz, Fakher Assaad</i>
<p>Projection of the Coulomb potential onto flat bands paves the way to design
various interactions in the particle-hole and particle-particle channels. Here
we pose the question if we can use this mapping to overcome the negative sign
problem for the simplest possible frustrated spin system consisting a trimer of
spins-1/2 coupled with an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. While the
answer is negative, we show that we can map the sign problem for frustrated
spin systems onto a problem where we need to simulate particle-hole symmetric
systems but with long-ranged Coulomb interactions prevailing over short-ranged
ones. While the latter systems are currently not accessible to auxiliary field
determinant quantum Monte Carlo, this mapping motivates algorithmic development
that may overcome this issue.

<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>We investigate the instability toward a skyrmion crystal under an in-plane
magnetic field in centrosymmetric tetragonal magnets. By performing the
simulated annealing for a spin model on the square lattice, we find that the
interplay among the easy-plane two-spin anisotropic interaction, positive
biquadratic interaction, and high-harmonic wave-vector interaction plays an
important role in stabilizing the skyrmion crystal in the in-plane external
magnetic field. The obtained skyrmion crystal consists of a pair of vortex and
antivortex with opposite polarization in terms of the out-of-plane spin
component. We also show that various multiple-$Q$ states emerge depending on
the model parameters. Our results indicate the possibility of topological spin
textures in centrosymmetric tetragonal magnets with easy-plane magnetic
anisotropy when the ground-state spin configuration at zero field is
characterized by a single-$Q$ in-plane cycloidal spiral state.

<h3>Emergent electric field induced by current-driven domain wall motion in  a room-temperature antiferromagnet FeSn2</h3>

<br>
<i>Tomoyuki Yokouchi, Yuta Yamane, Yasufumi Araki, Jun'ichi Ieda, Yuki Shiomi</i>
<p>Antiferromagnets have attracted extensive interest as platforms for nanoscale
spintronic devices owing to ultrafast spin dynamics and lack of a stray field.
One of the crucial missing pieces in antiferromagnets is a quantum-mechanical
electric field known as an emergent electric field, which has been observed for
the motion of ferromagnetic spin texture. Since this phenomenon allows for the
development of novel spintronic devices such as quantum inductors, its
identification in antiferromagnets is vital for developing nanoscale spintronic
devices. Here, we demonstrate that the motion of antiferromagnetic spin
textures generates an emergent electric field. In a room-temperature
antiferromagnet FeSn2, we observed large current-nonlinear responses in the
imaginary part of the complex impedance at and well above room temperature.
This signal is attributed to an emergent electric field resulting from the
nonadiabatic electron spin dynamics during the current-induced motion of
antiferromagnetic domain walls. Notably, the observed electric response is
strongly enhanced as the sample size decreases and robust against magnetic
fields. Our finding may pave the way for novel nanoscale quantum spintronic
devices.

<p>We investigate the effect of alloying at the 3d transition metal site of a
rare-earth-transition metal oxide, by considering NdFe0.5Cr0.5O3 alloy with two
equal and random distribution of 3d ions, Cr and Fe, interacting with an early
4f rare earth ion, Nd. Employing temperature- and field-dependent magnetization
measurements, temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction, neutron powder
diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy, we characterize its structural and
magnetic properties. Our study reveals bipolar magnetic switching (arising from
negative magnetization) and magnetocaloric effect which underline the potential
of the studied alloy in device application. The neutron diffraction study shows
the absence of spin reorientation transition over the entire temperature range
of 1.5-320 K, although both parent compounds exhibit spin orientation
transition. We discuss the microscopic origin of this curious behavior. The
neutron diffraction results also reveal the ordering of Nd spins at an
unusually high temperature of about 40 K, which is corroborated by Raman
measurements.

<h3>A phenomenological model for interstitial hydrogen absorption in niobium</h3>

<br>
<i>Arvind Ramachandran, Houlong Zhuang, Klaus Lackner</i>
<p>A phenomenological model has been developed for hydrogen absorption in
niobium. The model has 9 free parameters that have a physical basis. The model
provides an excellent fit to the highly accurate isotherm data by Veleckis et
al. and has been cross validated by limiting the fitting procedure to a
training set. The model makes it possible to extract more information from the
data than could be extracted with the computational methods available when the
measurements were made. The partial molal enthalpy and partial molal entropy of
hydrogen dissolution were calculated using the parameter values corresponding
to the best fit to the isotherms. These quantities are consistent with those
reported by Veleckis et al. Interpreting the model parameter values reveals
insights into the nature of the interaction between hydrogen atoms in niobium.
These insights supports our previous analysis of hydrogen interactions in
niobium using density functional theory calculations.

<i>Anuja Singh, Bhaskaran Muralidharan</i>
<p>A holistic computational analysis is developed to advance models for quantum
efficiency of InAs/GaSb superlattice-based photodetectors. Starting with the
electronic band characteristics computed by taking the InSb at the interface
using the 8-band k.p approach, we demonstrate the impact of InAs and GaSb
widths on the the bandgap, carrier concentration, and the oscillator strength
for type-II superlattices. Subsequently, the alteration of these
characteristics due to the extra AlSb layer in the M superlattice is
investigated. Extending our models for determining TE- and TM-polarized optical
absorption, our calculations reveal that the TE-polarized absorption shows a
substantial influence near the conduction-heavy hole band transition energy,
which eventually diminishes, owing to the dominant TM-contribution due to the
conduction-light hole band transition. Extending our analysis to the dark
currents, we notice that Schokley-Read-Hall recombination dominates at lower
doping levels, while radiative recombination becomes dominant at higher doping
levels. Auger transitions are also predicted using the conduction
mini-bandwidth and the transition probabilities. We show that long-wavelength M
superlattice structures exhibit longer diffusion lengths due to higher
recombination lifetimes, indicating that it can be heavily doped to improve the
quantum efficiency. Mid-wavelength M superlattices show comparable
characteristics, resulting in a 7% increase in quantum efficiency. Further, we
analyze the density of states blocked by the barrier; crucial for XBp
photodetector after absorber examination. Our work thus sets a stage for a
holistic and predictive theory aided analysis of the type-II superlattice
absorbers, from the atomistic interfacial details all the way to the dark
currents and photoluminescence spectra.

<p>Magnetic topological states refer to a class of exotic phases in magnetic
materials with their non-trivial topological property determined by magnetic
spin configurations. An example of such states is the quantum anomalous Hall
(QAH) state, which is a zero magnetic field manifestation of the quantum Hall
effect. Current research in this direction focuses on QAH insulators with a
thickness of less than 10nm. The thick QAH insulators in the
three-dimensional(3D) regime are limited, largely due to inevitable bulk
carriers being introduced in thick magnetic TI samples. Here, we employ
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to synthesize magnetic TI trilayers with a
thickness of up to ~106 nm. We find these samples exhibit well-quantized Hall
resistance and vanishing longitudinal resistance at zero magnetic field. By
varying magnetic dopants, gate voltages, temperature, and external magnetic
fields, we examine the properties of these thick QAH insulators and demonstrate
the robustness of the 3D QAH effect. The realization of the well-quantized 3D
QAH effect indicates that the side surface states of our thick magnetic TI
trilayers are gapped and thus do not affect the QAH quantization. The 3D QAH
insulators of hundred-nanometer thickness provide a promising platform for the
exploration of fundamental physics, including axion physics and image magnetic
monopole, and the advancement of electronic and spintronic devices to
circumvent Moore's law.

<p>The ground-state phases of mixed diamond chains with ($S, \tau^{(1)},
\tau^{(2)})=(1/2,1/2,1)$, where $S$ is the magnitude of vertex spins, and
$\tau^{(1)}$ and $\tau^{(2)}$ are those of apical spins, are investigated. The
two apical spins in each unit cell are coupled by an exchange coupling
$\lambda$. The vertex spins are coupled with the top and bottom apical spins by
exchange couplings $1+\delta$ and $1-\delta$, respectively. Although this model
has an infinite number of local conservation laws for $\delta=0$, they are lost
for finite $\delta$. The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the
numerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical
approximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a
nonmagnetic phase and several kinds of ferrimagnetic phases. We find two
different ferrimagnetic phases without spontaneous translational symmetry
breakdown. It is also found that the quantized ferrimagnetic phases with large
spatial periodicities present for $\delta=0$ are easily destroyed by small
$\delta$ and replaced by a partial ferrimagnetic phase. The nonmagnetic phase
is considered to be a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase based on the
recently extended Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to the site-reflection invariant
spin chains and numerical diagonalization results.

<i>Chao Shen, Wenkang Zhan, Jian Tang, Zhaofeng Wu, Bo Xu, Chao Zhao, Zhanguo Wang</i>
<p>Thin film deposition is an essential step in the semiconductor process.
During preparation or loading, the substrate is exposed to the air unavoidably,
which has motivated studies of the process control to remove the surface oxide
before thin film deposition. Optimizing the deoxidation process in molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) for a random substrate is a multidimensional challenge and
sometimes controversial. Due to variations in semiconductor materials and
growth processes, the determination of substrate deoxidation temperature is
highly dependent on the grower's expertise; the same substrate may yield
inconsistent results when evaluated by different growers. Here, we employ a
machine learning (ML) hybrid convolution and vision transformer (CNN-ViT)
model. This model utilizes reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
video as input to determine the deoxidation status of the substrate as output,
enabling automated substrate deoxidation under a controlled architecture. This
also extends to the successful application of deoxidation processes on other
substrates. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of models trained on data
from a single MBE equipment to achieve high-accuracy deployment on other
equipment. In contrast to traditional methods, our approach holds exceptional
practical value. It standardizes deoxidation temperatures across various
equipment and substrate materials, advancing the standardization research
process in semiconductor preparation, a significant milestone in thin film
growth technology. The concepts and methods demonstrated in this work are
anticipated to revolutionize semiconductor manufacturing in optoelectronics and
microelectronics industries by applying them to diverse material growth
processes.

<p>The underlying dielectric properties of materials, intertwined with
intriguing phenomena such as topological polariton modes and anisotropic
thermal conductivities, stem from the anisotropy in atomic vibrations.
Conventionally, X-ray diffraction techniques have been employed to estimate
thermal ellipsoids of distinct elements, albeit lacking the desired spatial and
energy resolutions. Here we introduce a novel approach utilizing the dark-field
monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy for momentum-selective
vibrational spectroscopy, enabling the cartographic delineation of variations
of phonon polarization vectors. By applying this technique to centrosymmetric
cubic-phase strontium titanate, we successfully discern two types of oxygen
atoms exhibiting contrasting vibrational anisotropies below and above 60 meV
due to their frequency-linked thermal ellipsoids. This method establishes a new
pathway to visualize phonon eigenvectors at specific crystalline sites for
diverse elements, thus delving into uncharted realms of dielectric, optical,
and thermal property investigations with unprecedented spatial resolutions.

<p>The Yang-Lee edge singularity was originally studied from the standpoint of
mathematical foundations of phase transitions, and its physical demonstration
has been of active interest both theoretically and experimentally. However, the
presence of an imaginary magnetic field in the Yang-Lee edge singularity has
made it challenging to develop a direct observation of the anomalous scaling
with negative scaling dimension associated with this critical phenomenon. We
experimentally implement an imaginary magnetic field and demonstrate the
Yang-Lee edge singularity through a nonunitary evolution governed by a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in an open quantum system, where a classical system
is mapped to a quantum system via the equivalent canonical partition function.
In particular, we directly observe the partition function in our experiment
using heralded single photons. The nonunitary quantum criticality is identified
with the singularity at an exceptional point. We also demonstrate
unconventional scaling laws for the finite-temperature dynamics unique to
quantum systems.

<i>A.N. Aleksandrova, I.L. Kurbakov, A.K. Fedorov, Yu.E. Lozovik</i>
<p>We predict a stable density-waves-type supersolid phase of a dilute gas of
tilted dipolar bosons in a two-dimensional (2D) geometry. This many-body phase
is manifested by the formation of the stripe pattern and elasticity coexisting
together with the Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity at zero
temperature. With the increasing the tilting angle the type of the
gas-supersolid transition changes from the first order to the second one
despite the 2D character of the system, whereas the anisotropy and many-body
stabilizing interactions play crucial role. Our approach is based on the
numerical analysis of the phase diagram using the simulated annealing method
for a free-energy functional. The predicted supersolid effect can be realized
in a variety of experimental setups ranging from excitons in heterostructures
to cold atoms and polar molecules in optical potentials.

<p>A complex interplay between the crystal structure and electron behavior
within borophene renders this material an intriguing 2D system with many of its
electronic properties still undiscovered. Experimental insight into those
properties is additionally hampered by the limited capabilities of the
established synthesis methods, which in turn inhibits the realization of
potential borophene applications. In this multi-method study, photoemission
spectroscopies and scanning probe techniques complemented by theoretical
calculations have been used to investigate the electronic characteristics of a
high-coverage, single-layer borophene on Ir(111) substrate. Our results show
that the binding of borophene to Ir(111) exhibits pronounced one-dimensional
modulation and transforms borophene into a nano-grating. The scattering of
photoelectrons from this structural grating gives rise to the replication of
electronic bands. In addition, the binding modulation is reflected in the
chemical reactivity of borophene and gives rise to its inhomogeneous aging
effect. Such aging is easily reset by dissolving boron atoms in iridium at high
temperature followed by their reassembly into a fresh atomically-thin borophene
mesh. Besides proving electron-grating capabilities of the boron monolayer, our
data provides a comprehensive insight into the electronic properties of
epitaxial borophene which is vital for further examination of other boron
systems of reduced dimensionality.

<p>We investigate the non-adiabatic effects of a moving adsorbate interacting
with a metal electrode immersed in a solvent using the time-dependent
Newns-Anderson-Schmickler model Hamiltonian. We have adopted a semi-classical
trajectory treatment of the adsorbate to discuss the electron and energy
transfers between the adsorbate and the electrode. Using the Keldysh Green's
function scheme, we found that the electron transfer rate is suppressed by the
adsorbate motion and coupling with the bath phonons that model the solvent. We
consider the excitation of electron-hole pairs as the energy loss mechanism for
energy exchange. This energy dissipation channel is hindered by the interaction
with the solvent modes and promoted by the applied electrode potential. In the
slow-motion limit, we provide analytical expressions for the average energy
transfer rate and the electronic friction coefficient.

S=5/2 [Kermarrec et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 157202 (2021)], we now
investigate the impact of spin quantum number S on the ground state properties
by studying the isostructural kagom\'e magnet Li9Cr3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 (LCPO) with
active t2g orbitals and S = 3/2. Thermodynamic measurements reveal that the
ground state properties of LCPO is dominated by the ferromagnetic interactions
with a mean-field temperature $\theta \sim$ 3 K (J < 1 K) and the ordering
temperature, Tc ~ 2.7 K, and the size of the ordered moment $\sim 1.05 \pm 0.25
$ ~${\mu}_B$ is significantly reduced from that of a fully ordered moment. The
ab initio electronic structure calculations nicely corroborate the
thermodynamic results and suggest the presence of additional in and
out-of-plane further neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings, though significantly
weaker in comparison to the dominant first-nearest neighbor ferromagnetic
coupling. The spin-lattice relaxation rate measured with fields larger than the
saturation field shows a magnetic field induced gap ($\Delta \propto B$) in the
excitation spectrum, and in $B \rightarrow 0$ limit the gap has a finite
intercept ~ 3 K, equivalent to the mean-field scale. We interpret the origin of
this gap is associated with the magnetic interactions inherent to the material.
With our experimental results, we establish the stabilization of a
ferromagnetic like ground state and the persistence of magnetic-correlations
above the ordering temperature in LCPO.

<h3>Metastability and anharmonicity enhance defect-assisted nonradiative  recombination in low-symmetry semiconductors</h3>

<i>Menglin Huang, Shanshan Wang, Shiyou Chen</i>
<p>Strong nonradiative recombination has been observed in quasi-one-dimensional
antimony selenide, which runs counter to the simple intuition that claims high
defect tolerance exists in semiconductors with antibonding state in the valence
band and bonding state in the conduction band. Here we reveal such a defect
intolerance actually stems from the richness of structural metastability and
vibrational anharmonicity owing to the low-symmetry atomic structure. Taking
the deep defect V$_{\rm Se}$ as a benchmark, we show the defect with its
ground-state configuration alone does not act as a recombination center.
Instead, we identify three different configurations with different formation
energies, such richness of metastability offers a higher probability to
accomplish a rapid recombination cycle. Another contributing factor is the
anharmonicity in the potential energy surfaces that is caused by the large
atomic relaxation, which elevates the total capture coefficient by 2-3 orders
of magnitude compared with harmonic approximation. Therefore, the unique
properties from both crystals and phonons in quasi-one-dimensional system
enhance the nonradiative recombination, making the traditional intuition of
defect tolerance invalid. These results highlight the importance of the correct
identification of metastable defects and phonon anharmonicity in the
nonradiative recombination in low-symmetry semiconductors.

<p>Clarifying the underlying mechanisms that govern ordering transitions in
condensed matter systems is crucial for comprehending emergent properties and
phenomena. While transitions are often classified as electronically driven or
lattice-driven, we present a departure from this conventional paradigm in the
case of the double perovskite Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. Leveraging resonant and
non-resonant elastic x-ray scattering techniques, we unveil the simultaneous
ordering of structural distortions and charge quadrupoles at a critical
temperature of $T_\mathrm{q}$$\sim$33 K. Using a variety of complementary
first-principles-based computational techniques, we demonstrate that while
electronic interactions drive the ordering at $T_\mathrm{q}$, it is ultimately
the lattice that dictates the specific ground state that emerges. Our findings
highlight the crucial interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of
freedom, providing a unified framework to understand and predict unconventional
emergent phenomena in quantum materials.

<br>
<i>J. C. G. Henriques, Mar Ferri-Cortés, J. Fernández-Rossier</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experimental breakthroughs, we propose a strategy to
design two-dimensional spin lattices with competing interactions that lead to
non-trivial emergent quantum states. We consider $S=1/2$ nanographenes with
$C_3$ symmetry as building blocks, and we leverage the potential to control
both the sign and the strength of exchange with first neighbours to build a
family of spin models. Specifically, we consider the case of a Heisenberg model
in a triangle-decorated honeycomb lattice with competing ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic interactions whose ratio can be varied in a wide range. Based
on exact diagonalization of both fermionic and spin models we predict a quantum
phase transition between a valence bond crystal of spin singlets with triplon
excitations living in a Kagom\'e lattice and a N\'eel phase of effective
$S=3/2$ in the limit of dominant ferromagnetic interactions.

<p>A theoretical investigation was conducted on Na-based fluoro-perovskites
NaYF3 (Y = Sc, Ti) to examine their structural, optical, electronic, and
mechanical characteristics for the first time. These cubic compounds exhibit
structural stability, maintaining perovskite structures with lattice spacing
ranging from 4.15 to 4.26 {\AA}. Computation of elastic parameters confirms
their stability, ionic bonding, ductility, and anisotropy. Computed band
profiles reveal the half-metallic nature with indirect (M-{\Gamma}) bandgaps
for the spin-down configurations. Furthermore, density-of-states analysis
highlights the role of Y (Sc, Ti) atoms in the metallic character and
conduction band contribution. The lack of absorbance in the visible region
highlights the materials' suitability for optoelectronic devices. This

<h3>Electrically tunable flat bands with layer-resolved charge distribution  in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Wei-En Tseng, Mei-Yin Chou</i>
<p>At a small twist angle, exotic electronic properties emerge in twisted
monolayer-bilayer graphene (aAB), including electrically switchable magnetic
order and correlated insulating states. These fascinating many-body phenomena
manifest when the low-energy bands feature a narrow band width. In this study,
we examine the electronic structure of aAB using first-principles calculations
combined with an accurate tight-binding model. We find that the presence of an
intrinsic polarization greatly modifies the low-energy bands of aAB.
Furthermore, the low-energy bands reach a minimum width at a quasi-magic angle
and feature a layer-dependent charge localization and delocalization pattern.
In the presence of an electric field, an energy gap opens only if lattice
relaxation is taken into account. The particle-hole asymmetry in aAB further
leads to flatter conduction bands compared with the valence bands, with an
electrically tunable band width and band gap, and a switchable
sublattice-dependent charge localization and delocalization pattern.

<h3>Decomposing Electronic Structures in Twisted Multilayers: Bridging  Spectra and Incommensurate Wave Functions</h3>

<br>
<i>Citian Wang, Huaqing Huang</i>
<p>Twisted multilayer systems, encompassing materials like twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG), twisted trilayer graphene, and twisted bilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides, have garnered significant attention in condensed matter
physics. Despite this interest, a comprehensive description of their electronic
structure, especially in dealing with incommensurate wave functions, poses a
persistent challenge. Here, we introduce a unified theoretical framework for
efficiently describing the electronic structure covering both spectrum and wave
functions in twisted multilayer systems, accommodating both commensurate and
incommensurate scenarios. Our analysis reveals that physical observables in
these systems can be systematically decomposed into contributions from
individual layers and their respective ${k}$ points, even in the presence of
intricate interlayer coupling. This decomposition facilitates the computation
of wave function-related quantities relevant to response characteristics beyond
spectra. We propose a local low-rank approximated Hamiltonian in the truncated
Hilbert space that can achieve any desired accuracy, offering numerical
efficiency compared to the previous large-scale calculations. The validity of
our theory is confirmed through computations of spectra and optical
conductivity for moir\'e TBG, and demonstrating its applicability in
incommensurate quasicrystalline TBG. Our findings provide a generic approach to
studying the electronic structure of twisted multilayer systems and pave the
way for future research.

<h3>Tunable exciton polaritons in band-gap engineered hexagonal boron  nitride</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01913" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01913</a>
<br>
<i>Pedro Ninhos, Christos Tserkezis, N. Asger Mortensen, Nuno M. R. Peres</i>
<p>We show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional insulator, when
subjected to an external superlattice potential forms a new paradigm for
electrostatically tunable excitons in the near- and mid-ultraviolet (UV). The
imposed potential has three consequences: (i) it renormalizes the effective
mass tensor, leading to anisotropic effective masses; (ii) it renormalizes the
band gap, eventually reducing it; (iii) it reduces the exciton binding
energies. All these consequences depend on a single dimensionless parameter,
which includes the product of strength of the external potential with its
period. In addition to the excitonic energy levels, we compute the optical
conductivity along two orthogonal directions, and from it the absorption
spectrum. The results for the latter show that our system is able to mimic a
grid polarizer. These characteristics make one-dimensional hBN superlattices a
viable and unexplored platform for fine-tuned polaritonics in the UV to visible
spectral range.

<h3>Thermodynamic evidence for the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin Ovchinnikov state in  the isotropic superconductor Ti4Ir2O</h3>

<br>
<i>Jiaqi Hu, Yat Hei Ng, Omargeldi Atanov, Bin-Bin Ruan, Zhi-An Ren, Rolf Lortz</i>
<p>This study presents an investigation of the isotropic superconductor Ti4Ir2O,
focusing on its magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram near and above the
Pauli limit for superconductivity. The data exhibits characteristic features
that align with the formation of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
state, including a deviation of the upper critical field line from the standard
WHH model upon approaching the Pauli limiting field and a phase transition line
separating the ordinary low-field superconducting phase from an unusual high
field superconducting state above the Pauli limit. We discuss why the upper
critical field line in this isotropic superconductor can approach the Pauli
limit, necessitating a particularly high orbital limit for superconductivity.
The study suggests strong spin-orbit coupling as a plausible reason, due to the
composition of particularly heavy atoms in combination with multiband
superconductivity with multiple superconducting gaps. The research also
identifies peculiar features in the specific heat data set taken at 0.6 K,
which may be an example of the segmentation of the FFLO phase with multiple q
phases. The findings provide an explanation for the violation of the Pauli
limit in this superconductor, adding a fully isotropic superconductor to the
list of potential FFLO superconductors and providing new insights for
contemporary theories of the FFLO state.

<h3>Electronic and topological characters of the ideal magnetic topological  materials EuAuX with X = P, As, Sb, and Bi</h3>

<i>Shengwei Chi, Gang Xu</i>
<p>Ideal magnetic topological materials have great significance in both
fundamental physics and technical applications, due to their abundant exotic
quantum properties and facilitation of control. Using first-principles
calculations, we find several ideal magnetic topological materials in EuTX (T =
Cu, Ag, and Au; X= P, As, Sb, and Bi) family. Particularly, EuAuP is the
ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, and EuAuX (X=As, Sb, and Bi) in their ground
state with in-plane moments are the antiferromagnetic semimetals hosting the
topological gap near the Fermi level. By tuning the magnetic moments to z-axis,
EuAuX (X=As, Sb, and Bi) could further evolve into triple degenerate nodal
points (TDNPs) semimetal states. The main characteristics of antiferromagnetic
TDNP semimetal, including the Fermi arcs, and tangent Fermi surfaces with
opposite spin winding numbers, are also studied. Our work provides a promising
platform to modulate the magnetism, topological electronic structures and
emergent quantum states.

<i>Himanshu Himanshu, Elisa Rebolini, Ketty Beauvois, Stéphane Grenier, Bernard Mercey, Bernadette Domengès, Bachir Ouladdiaf, Marie-Bernadette Lepetit, Charles Simon</i>
<p>We use a combination of transmission electron microscopy, X-Ray and neutron
diffraction, SQUID magnetometry and symmetry analysis to determine the nuclear
and magnetic structure of an epitaxial LSMO film, deposited on a Si substrate.
The film undergoes a magnetic ordering transition at 260K. At 300K, in the
paramagnetic phase, the manganite film has a $I4/m$ space group. In the
magnetic phase, SQUID and neutron diffraction results lead us to assign a
ferromagnetic spin-order to the film, associated to magnetic moments with a
slightly out-of-plane component, namely $(3.5, 0, 0.3)\,\mu_B$. Symmetry
analysis further shows that only the $P\bar 1'$ group is compatible with such a
magnetic ordering.

<br>
<i>Peru d'Ornellas, Johannes Knolle</i>
<p>The interplay of frustrated interactions and lattice geometry can lead to a
variety of exotic quantum phases. Here we unearth a particularly rich phase
diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the star lattice, a triangle
decorated honeycomb lattice breaking sublattice symmetry. In the
antiferromagnetic regime, the interplay of Heisenberg coupling and geometric
frustration leads to the formation of valence bond solid (VBS) phases -- a
singlet VBS and a bond selective triplet VBS stabilized by the Kitaev exchange.
We show that the ratio of the Kitaev versus Heisenberg exchange tunes between
these VBS phases and chiral quantum spin liquid regimes. Remarkably, the VBS
phases host a whole variety of chiral triplon excitations with high Chern
numbers in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We discuss our results in
light of a recently synthesized star lattice material and other decorated
lattice systems.

<h3>Directional spontaneous emission in photonic crystal slabs</h3>

<br>
<i>Erik Petrovish Navarro-Barón, Herbert Vinck-Posada, Alejandro González-Tudela</i>
<p>Spontaneous emission is one of the most fundamental out-of-equilibrium
processes in which an excited quantum emitter relaxes to the ground state due
to quantum fluctuations. In this process, a photon is emitted that can interact
with other nearby emitters and establish quantum correlations between them,
e.g., via super and subradiance effects. One way to modify these
photon-mediated interactions is to alter the dipole radiation patterns of the
emitter, e.g., by placing photonic crystals near them. One recent example is
the generation of strong directional emission patterns-key to enhancing super
and subradiance effects-in two dimensions by employing photonic crystals with
band structures characterized by linear isofrequency contours and
saddle-points. However, these studies have predominantly used oversimplified
toy models, overlooking the electromagnetic field's intricacies in actual
materials, including aspects like geometrical dependencies, emitter positions,
and polarization. Our study delves into the interaction between these
directional emission patterns and the aforementioned variables, revealing the
untapped potential to fine-tune collective quantum optical phenomena.

<h3>Doping dependence of superconductivity on a honeycomb lattice within the  framework of kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01972" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01972</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Lan, Xian-Feng Yu, Li-Ting Zhang</i>
<p>Unconventional superconductivity on a honeycomb lattice has received
increasing interest since the discovery of graphene primarily due to the
similarities between materials with a honeycomb lattice and cuprate
superconductors. Many theoretical studies have been conducted on
superconductivity on a honeycomb lattice, however, a consistent picture is
still lacking. In this article we have extended the theory of
kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity, which has been developed to
investigate unconventional superconductivity in cuprate superconductors, to
explore superconductivity on a honeycomb lattice within the $t$-$J$ model. Our
results demonstrate that the charge-carrier pair gap parameter with
$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+{\rm i}d_{xy}$-wave symmetry exhibits a dome-like shape as a
function of doping, with superconductivity emerging at a certain doping
concentration and disappearing at high doping levels, similar to what has been
observed in cuprate and cobaltate superconductors. Furthermore, the
charge-carrier pair gap parameter decreases with increasing the value of $J/t$
(the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling constant relative to the
nearest-neighbor hopping integral), and approaches zero when $J/t$ reaches a
sufficiently large value. This indicates that the antiferromagnetic order will
suppress the superconducting state and a sufficiently strong exchange coupling
will completely destroy the superconductivity. Taking into account our present
results together with the corresponding results of cuprate and cobaltate
superconductors, it appears that the dome-like shape of the doping dependence
of the charge-carrier pair gap parameter may be a common feature in doped Mott
insulators.

<p>Nanomachines are often interpreted as autonomous Maxwell's demons or
information engines. This interpretation is appealing from a conceptual
viewpoint but sometimes lacks a rigorous and precise formulation. Moreover, it
is unclear whether this interpretation is truly useful for analyzing the
performance of nanomachines or designing more efficient ones. The concepts of
mutual information and information flows provide a quantitative and rigorous
account of the role of information in physical systems. In this chapter, we
present a pedagogical review of these concepts and apply them to a specific
energy transducer at the nanoscale, which couples the tunnel transport of
electrons through a carbon nanotube with its mechanical oscillations.

<h3>Analysis of the general uncertainty propagation and calculation of the  systematic uncertainty of the Neumann Equation of State for surface free  energy determination</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02077" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02077</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan M. Schuster, Carlos E. Schvezov, Mario R. Rosenberger</i>
<p>The determination of the surface free energy $\gamma_{\text{SV}}$ of solid
materials provides information to explain and understand a wide variety of
phenomena in surface science. One of the most widely used methods to determine
the value of $\gamma_{\text{SV}}$ is the Neumann equation of state (EQS), whose
application requires the values of the contact angle $(\theta)$ and the surface
tension of a probe liquid $\gamma_{\text{LV}}$. Both parameters are determined
experimentally, and their values may be subject to considerable uncertainty. In
the present work, the uncertainties of the EQS are analyzed by means of the
Taylor series method, using a polynomial adjustment to the EQS previously
reported. This analysis allowed us to determine the effects of the ${\theta}$
and $\gamma_{\text{LV}}$ uncertainties on $\gamma_{\text{SV}}$ values. The
$\gamma_{\text{SV}}$ of polyoxymethylene (POM) and polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) was calculated using the EQS from four probe liquids and taking into
account the propagation of the ${\theta}$ and $\gamma_{\text{LV}}$
uncertainties. Generally, the comparison of the $\gamma_{\text{SV}}$ values
calculated from the different probe fluids revealed significant differences. As
a solution to this inconsistency in the EQS method, we proposed taking into
account a systematic standard uncertainty associated with the method equal to
$1.3 \, \text{mJ/m}^2$ . This allowed the differences between the
$\gamma_{\text{SV}}$ values for the different probe liquids to be
non-significant and therefore the method to be consistent.
