<h3>Hydrodynamic approach to two-dimensional electron systems</h3>

The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in hydrodynamic effects
in interacting electron systems in ultra-pure materials. One such material,
graphene, is not only an excellent platform for the experimental realization of
the hydrodynamic flow of electrons, but also allows for a controlled derivation
of the hydrodynamic equations on the basis of kinetic theory. The resulting
hydrodynamic theory of electronic transport in graphene yields quantitative
predictions for experimentally relevant quantities, e.g. viscosity, electrical
conductivity, etc. Here I review recent theoretical advances in the field,
compare the hydrodynamic theory of charge carriers in graphene with
relativistic hydrodynamics and recent experiments, and discuss applications of
hydrodynamic approach to novel materials beyond graphene.

Topological phases of matter have remained an active area of research in the
last few decades. Periodic driving is known to be a powerful tool for enriching
such exotic phases, which leads to various phenomena with no static analogs.
One such phenomenon is the emergence of the elusive $pi/2$ modes, i.e., a type
of topological boundary state pinned at a quarter of the driving frequency. The
latter may lead to the formation of Floquet parafermions in the presence of
interaction, which is known to support more computational power than Majorana
particles. In this work, we experimentally verify the signature of $\pi/2$
modes in an acoustic waveguide array, which is designed to simulate a
square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. This is
accomplished by confirming the $4T$-periodicity ($T$ being the driving period)
profile of an initial-boundary excitation, which we also show theoretically to
be the smoking gun evidence of $\pi/2$ modes. Our findings are expected to
motivate further studies of $\pi/2$ modes in quantum systems for potential
technological applications.
