<h3>Population Effects Driving Active Material Degradation in Intercalation  Electrodes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07892" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07892</a>

Single particle modeling, used in most battery simulations to describe
intercalation and degradation, lacks the accurate physics to describe
interactions between particles. To remedy this, we formulate a model that
describes the evolution of degradation of a population of battery active
material particles using ideas in population genetics of fitness evolution,
where the state of a system depends on the health of each particle that
contributes to the system. With the fitness formulation, the model incorporates
effects of particle size and heterogeneous degradation effects which accumulate
in the particles as the battery is cycled, accounting for different active
material degradation mechanisms. At the particle scale, degradation progresses
non-uniformly across the population of active particles, observed from the
autocatalytic relationship between fitness and degradation. Electrode level
degradation is formed from various contributions of the particle level
heterogeneous degradation, especially from smaller particles. It is shown that
specific mechanisms of particle level degradation can be associated with
characteristic signatures in the capacity-loss and voltage profiles.
Conversely, certain features in the electrode level phenomena can also give
insights into the relative importance of different particle level degradation
mechanisms.

<h3>Interfacial Magnon-Mediated Superconductivity in Twisted Bilayer  Graphene</h3>

The interfacial coupling between electrons and magnons in adjacent layers can
mediate an attractive electron-electron interaction and induce
superconductivity. We consider magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene sandwiched
between two ferromagnetic insulators to optimize this effect. As a result,
magnons induce an interlayer superconducting state characterized by $p$-wave
symmetry. We investigate two candidate ferromagnets. The van der Waals
ferromagnet CrI$_3$ stands out because it allows compression to tune the
superconducting state with an exponential sensitivity. This control adds a new
dimension to the tunability of twisted bilayer graphene. Our results open a new
path for exploring magnon-induced superconductivity.

Recent advances in micro- and nano-technologies allow the construction of
complex active systems from biological and synthetic materials. An interesting
example is active vesicles, which consist of a membrane enclosing
self-propelled particles, and exhibit several features resembling biological
cells. We investigate numerically the behavior of active vesicles, where the
enclosed self-propelled particles can adhere to the membrane. A vesicle is
represented by a dynamically triangulated membrane, while the adhesive active
particles are modelled as active Brownian particles (ABPs) that interact with
the membrane via the Lennard-Jones potential. Phase diagrams of dynamic vesicle
shapes as a function of ABP activity and particle volume fraction inside the
vesicle are constructed for different strengths of adhesive interactions. At
low ABP activity, adhesive interactions dominate over the propulsion forces,
such that the vesicle attains near static configurations, with protrusions of
membrane-wrapped ABPs having ring-like and sheet-like structures. At moderate
particle densities and strong enough activities, active vesicles show dynamic
highly-branched tethers filled with string-like arrangements of ABPs, which do
not occur in the absence of particle adhesion to the membrane. At large volume
fractions of ABPs, vesicles fluctuate for moderate particle activities, and
elongate and finally split into two vesicles for large ABP propulsion
strengths. We also analyze membrane tension, active fluctuations, and ABP
characteristics (e.g., mobility, clustering), and compare them to the case of
active vesicles with non-adhesive ABPs. The adhesion of ABPs to the membrane
significantly alters the behavior of active vesicles, and provides an
additional parameter for controlling their behavior.

<h3>Optical linear-nonlinear and dispersion parameters of thermally  evaporated SnS thin films as absorber material for solar cells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07983" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07983</a>
<br>
<i>Vinita, P. Arun, Chandra Kumar, R. Rai, B. K. Singh</i>
<br>
<br>
In this manuscript, we report the results of optical properties of SnS thin
films, deposited on FTO coated glass substrates at room temperature by thermal
evaporation technique. In addition, the effect of film thickness on the optical
behavior of FTO/SnS is analyzed and obtained results are compared with data of
SnS films grown on glass and ITO substrates. Our study indicates that the
properties of SnS film are independent of the substrate material. Further, the
influence of the film thickness on the other optical parameters including,
linear and third order nonlinear optical constants and dispersion parameters
have also been investigated using the transmission, reflection, and absorption
spectra. It is found that the optical band gap decreases from 2.07 to 1.30 eV
with increase in SnS film thickness, whereas the refractive index increases
with increasing thickness. Additionally, the oscillator energy, and the
dispersion energy are estimated using WempleDiDomenico approach. The dispersion
energies are in the range of 7.20 to 4.59 eV, while the oscillator energies of
the thin films are in the range of 5.49 to 2.24 eV. Moreover, the nonlinear
refractive index, and optical susceptibility are calculated by using the
empirical relation of Tichy and Ticha. The volume of data suggests optical
properties of SnS thin films are strongly dependent on film thickness.

<h3>Low-threshold lasing of optically pumped micropillar lasers with  Al$_{0.2}$Ga$_{0.8}$As/Al$_{0.9}$Ga$_{0.1}$As distributed Bragg reflectors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08026</a>
<br>
<i>Ching-Wen Shih, Imad Limame, Sebastian Krüger, Chirag C. Palekar, Aris Koulas-Simos, Daniel Brunner, Stephan Reitzenstein</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on the realization and characterization of optically pumped
micropillar lasers with low-absorbing
Al$_{0.2}$Ga$_{0.8}$As/Al$_{0.9}$Ga$_{0.1}$As dielectric Bragg reflectors
(DBRs) instead of commonly used GaAs/AlGaAs DBRs. A layer of (In, Ga)As quantum
dots (QDs) is embedded in the GaAs $\lambda$-cavity of as an active medium. We
experimentally study the lasing characteristics of the fabricated micropillars
by means of low-temperature photoluminescence with varying pump laser's
wavelength between 532 nm and 899 nm. The incorporation of 20% Al content in
the DBRs opens an optical pumping window from 700 nm to 820 nm, where the
excitation laser light can effectively reach the GaAs cavity above its bandgap,
while remaining transparent to the DBRs. This results in a substantially
improved pump efficiency, a low lasing threshold, and a high thermal stability.
Pump laser wavelengths outside of the engineered spectral window lead to low
pump efficiency due to strong absorption by the top DBR, or inefficient
excitation of pump-level excitons, respectively. The superiority of the
absorption-free modified DBRs is demonstrated by simply switching the pump
laser wavelength from 671 nm to 708 nm, which crosses the DBRs absorption edge
and drastically reduces the lasing threshold by more than an order of magnitude
from (363.5 $\pm$ 18.5) $\mu$W to (12.8 $\pm$ 0.3) $\mu$W.

<h3>Illuminating trap density trends in amorphous oxide semiconductors with  ultrabroadband photoconduction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08196" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08196</a>
<br>
<i>George W. Mattson, Kyle T. Vogt, John F. Wager, Matt W. Graham</i>
<br>
<br>
Under varying growth and device processing conditions, ultrabroadband
photoconduction (UBPC) reveals strongly evolving trends in the defect density
of states (DoS) for amorphous oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs).
Spanning the wide bandgap of amorphous InGaZnO$_x$ (a-IGZO), UBPC identifies
seven oxygen-deep donor vacancy peaks that are independently confirmed by
energetically matching to photoluminescence emission peaks. The sub-gap DoS
from 15 different types of a-IGZO TFTs all yield similar DoS, except only
back-channel etch TFTs can have a deep acceptor peak seen at 2.2 eV below the
conduction band mobility edge. This deep acceptor is likely a zinc vacancy,
evidenced by trap density which becomes 5-6x larger when TFT wet-etch methods
are employed. Certain DoS peaks are strongly enhanced for TFTs with active
channel processing damage caused by plasma exposure. While Ar implantation and
He plasma processing damage are similar, Ar plasma yields more disorder showing
a 2x larger valence-band Urbach energy and two orders of magnitude increase in
the deep oxygen vacancy trap density. Changing the growth conditions of a-IGZO
also impacts the DoS, with zinc-rich TFTs showing much poorer electrical
performance compared to 1:1:1 molar ratio a-IGZO TFTs owing to the former
having a ~10xlarger oxygen vacancy trap density. Finally, hydrogen is found to
behave as a donor in amorphous indium tin gallium zinc oxide TFTs.

<h3>Ergodicity Breaking Under Confinement in Cold-Atom Quantum Simulators</h3>

The quantum simulation of gauge theories on synthetic quantum matter devices
has gained a lot of traction in the last decade, making possible the
observation of a range of exotic quantum many-body phenomena. In this work, we
consider the spin-$1/2$ quantum link formulation of $1+1$D quantum
electrodynamics with a topological $\theta$-angle, which can be used to tune a
confinement-deconfinement transition. Exactly mapping this system onto a PXP
model with mass and staggered magnetization terms, we show an intriguing
interplay between confinement and the ergodicity-breaking paradigms of quantum
many-body scarring and Hilbert-space fragmentation. We map out the rich
dynamical phase diagram of this model, finding an ergodic phase at small values
of the mass $\mu$ and confining potential $\chi$, an emergent integrable phase
for large $\mu$, and a fragmented phase for large values of both parameters. We
also show that the latter hosts resonances that lead to a vast array of
effective models. We propose experimental probes of our findings, which can be
directly accessed in current cold-atom setups.

<h3>Disorder-Free Localization in $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theories with  Dynamical Matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07720" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07720</a>
<br>
<i>Jesse Osborne, Ian P. McCulloch, Jad C. Halimeh</i>
<br>
<br>
Disorder-free localization (DFL) has been established as a mechanism of
strong ergodicity breaking in $1+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with
dynamical matter for quenches starting in homogeneous initial states that span
an extensive number of gauge superselection sectors. Nevertheless, the fate of
DFL in $2+1$D in the presence of dynamical matter has hitherto remained an open
question of great interest in light of the instability of quenched-disorder
many-body localization in higher spatial dimensions. Using infinite matrix
product state calculations, we show that DFL survives in $2+1$D LGTs, albeit it
is generally less pronounced than in $1+1$D, and highly depends on the matter
configuration of the initial state. Through suitable matter configurations, we
are able to relate and compare the $1+1$D and $2+1$D cases, showing that the
main ingredient for the strength of DFL in our setup is the \textit{propagation
directionality} of matter. Our results suggest that, generically, DFL is
weakened with increasing spatial dimension, although it can be made independent
of the latter by minimizing the propagation directionality of matter in the
initial state.

<h3>Emergence of field-induced memory effect in spin ices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07741" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07741</a>

Out-of-equilibrium investigation of strongly correlated materials deciphers
the hidden equilibrium properties. Herein, we have investigated the
out-of-equilibrium magnetic properties of polycrystalline Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7
spin ices. The experimental results show the emergence of magnetic
field-induced anomalous hysteresis observed only in temperature/magnetic
field-dependent ac susceptibility measurements. The observed memory effect
(anomalous thermomagnetic hysteresis) strongly depends on the driving thermal
and non-thermal variables. Contrary, in the absence of the magnetic field,
dipolar interaction induced Ising paramagnetic to spin ice crossover develops a
liquid-gas transition type hysteresis below 4 K. Unlike field-induced
hysteresis, it shows weak dependency on thermal and non-thermal variables. Due
to the non-colinear spin structure, the applied dc bias magnetic field produces
quench disorder sites in the cooperative Ising spin matrix and suppresses the
spin-phonon coupling. These quench disorders create dynamic spin correlations
governed by quantum fluctuations, having slow spin relaxation and quick decay
times, which additionally contribute to ac susceptibility. The initial
conditions and measurement protocol decide the magnitude and sign of this
dynamical term contributing to ac susceptibility. It has been suggested that
such kind of out-of-equilibrium properties emerge by the cumulative effect of
geometric frustration, disorder, quantum fluctuations, and the cooperative
nature of spin dynamics of these materials.

<h3>Using CycleGANs to Generate Realistic STEM Images for Machine Learning</h3>

The rise of automation and machine learning (ML) in electron microscopy has
the potential to revolutionize materials research by enabling the autonomous
collection and processing of vast amounts of atomic resolution data. However, a
major challenge is developing ML models that can reliably and rapidly
generalize to large data sets with varying experimental conditions. To overcome
this challenge, we develop a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN)
that introduces a novel reciprocal space discriminator to augment simulated
data with realistic, complex spatial frequency information learned from
experimental data. This enables the CycleGAN to generate nearly
indistinguishable images from real experimental data, while also providing
labels for further ML applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach by training a fully convolutional network (FCN) to identify single
atom defects in a large data set of 4.5 million atoms, which we collected using
automated acquisition in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
microscope (STEM). Our approach yields highly adaptable FCNs that can adjust to
dynamically changing experimental variables, such as lens aberrations, noise,
and local contamination, with minimal manual intervention. This represents a
significant step towards building fully autonomous approaches for harnessing
microscopy big data.

Moir\'e potentials in two-dimensional materials have been proven to be of
fundamental importance to fully understand the electronic structure of van der
Waals heterostructures, from superconductivity to correlated excitonic states.
However, understanding how the moir\'e phonons, so-called phasons, affect the
properties of the system still remains an uncharted territory. In this work, we
demonstrate how phasons are integral to properly describing and understanding
low-temperature interlayer exciton diffusion in WS2/WSe2 heterostructure. We
perform photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to understand how the coupling
between the layers, affected by their relative orientation, impacts the
excitonic properties of the system. Samples fabricated with stacking angles of
0{\deg} and 60{\deg} are investigated taking into account the stacking angle
dependence of the two common moir\'e potential profiles. Additionally, we
present spatially and time-resolved exciton diffusion measurements, looking at
the photoluminescence emission in a temperature range from 30 K to 250 K. An
accurate potential for the two configurations are computed via density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, we perform molecular dynamics
simulation in order to visualize the phasons motion, estimating the phason
speed at different temperatures, providing novel insights into the mechanics of
exciton propagation at low temperatures that cannot be explained within the
frame of classical exciton diffusion alone.

<h3>Topology in the space-time scaling limit of quantum dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07752" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07752</a>
<br>
<i>Lorenzo Rossi, Jan Carl Budich, Fabrizio Dolcini</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the role of topology in the space-time scaling limit of
quantum quench dynamics, where both time and system size tend to infinity at a
constant ratio. There, while the standard topological characterization relying
on local unitary transformations becomes ill defined, we show how a novel
dynamical notion of topology naturally arises in the time-dependent Berry
phase. Specifically, we find that the presence of a locally invisible constant
magnetic flux is revealed by a dynamical staircase behavior of the Berry phase,
whose topologically quantized plateaus characterize the space-time scaling
limit of a quenched Rice-Mele model. These jumps in the Berry phase are also
shown to be related to the interband elements of the DC current operator. We
outline possible experimental platforms for observing the predicted phenomena
in finite systems.

<h3>Charged magnons on the surface of a topological insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07754</a>
<br>
<i>I. Martinez-Berumen, W. A. Coish, T. Pereg-Barnea</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a system of two-dimensional Dirac electrons (as is realized on the
surface of a 3D topological insulator) coupled to an array of localized spins.
The spins are coupled ferromagnetically to each other, forming an ordered
ground state with low-energy spin-wave excitations (magnons). The Dirac
electrons couple to the spins through a spin-dependent effective Zeeman field.
The out-of-plane effective Zeeman field therefore serves as a Dirac mass that
gaps the electronic spectrum. Once a spin is flipped, it creates a surrounding
domain in which the sign of the Dirac mass is opposite to that of the rest of
the sample. Therefore, an electronic bound state appears on the domain wall, as
predicted by Jackiw and Rebbi. However, in a quantum magnet, a localized spin
flip does not produce an eigenstate. Instead, the eigenstates correspond to
delocalized spin waves (magnons). As in the case of the single flipped spin,
the delocalized magnon also binds an in-gap electronic state. We name this
excitation a `Jackiw-Rebbi-Magnon' (JRM) and study its signature in the dynamic
spin susceptibility. When the sample is tunnel-coupled to an electronic
reservoir, a magnon produced in a system without any electrons hybridizes with
a JRM (which binds a single electron), producing magnon-JRM polaritons. For
such a system, we identify a quantum phase transition when the magnon-JRM
polariton energy falls below that of the fully polarized ferromagnetic ground
state.

<h3>Entanglement in tripartitions of topological orders: a diagrammatic  approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07763" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07763</a>
<br>
<i>Ramanjit Sohal, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies have demonstrated that measures of tripartite entanglement can
probe data characterizing topologically ordered phases to which bipartite
entanglement is insensitive. Motivated by these observations, we compute the
reflected entropy and logarithmic negativity, a mixed state entanglement
measure, in tripartitions of bosonic topological orders using the anyon
diagrammatic formalism. We consider tripartitions in which three subregions
meet at trijunctions and tetrajunctions. In the former case, we find a
contribution to the negativity which distinguishes between Abelian and
non-Abelian order while in the latter, we find a distinct universal
contribution to the reflected entropy. Finally, we demonstrate that the
negativity and reflected entropy are sensitive to the $F$-symbols for
configurations in which we insert an anyon trimer, for which the Markov gap,
defined as the difference between the reflected entropy and mutual information,
is also found to be non-vanishing.

<h3>Low rank Green's function representations applied to dynamical  mean-field theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07764" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07764</a>

<br>
<br>
Several recent works have introduced highly compact representations of
single-particle Green's functions in the imaginary time and Matsubara frequency
domains, as well as efficient interpolation grids used to recover the
representations. In particular, the intermediate representation with sparse
sampling and the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) make use of low-rank
compression techniques to obtain optimal approximations with controllable
accuracy. We consider the use of the DLR in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
calculations, and in particular, show that the standard full Matsubara
frequency grid can be replaced by the compact grid of DLR Matsubara frequency
nodes. We test the performance of the method for a DMFT calculation of
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ at temperature $50$K using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo
impurity solver, and demonstrate that Matsubara frequency quantities can be
represented on a grid of only $36$ nodes with no reduction in accuracy, or
increase in the number of self-consistent iterations, despite the presence of
significant Monte Carlo noise.

<h3>Symmetry Classification of Typical Quantum Entanglement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07778" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07778</a>
<br>
<i>Yuhan Liu, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Kohei Kawabata</i>
<br>
<br>
Entanglement entropy of typical quantum states, also known as the Page curve,
plays an important role in quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity.
However, the role of symmetry has remained largely unclear. Here, we establish
the classification of typical quantum entanglement for free fermions, or
equivalently the quadratic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with symmetry, on the basis
of the tenfold fundamental symmetry classes of time reversal, charge
conjugation, and chiral transformation. Through both analytical and numerical
calculations of random matrix theory, we show that the volume-law contribution
to average entanglement entropy is robust and remains unaffected by symmetry.
Conversely, we uncover that the constant terms of the average and variance of
entanglement entropy yield tenfold universal values unique to each symmetry
class. These constant terms originate from the combination of a global scaling
of the entanglement spectrum due to time-reversal symmetry and a singular peak
at the center of the entanglement spectrum due to chiral or particle-hole
symmetry.

<h3>Machine Learning Based Approach to Predict Ductile Damage Model  Parameters for Polycrystalline Metals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Damage models for ductile materials typically need to be parameterized, often
with the appropriate parameters changing for a given material depending on the
loading conditions. This can make parameterizing these models computationally
expensive, since an inverse problem must be solved for each loading condition.
Using standard inverse modeling techniques typically requires hundreds or
thousands of high-fidelity computer simulations to estimate the optimal
parameters. Additionally, the time of human expert is required to set up the
inverse model. Machine learning has recently emerged as an alternative approach
to inverse modeling in these settings, where the machine learning model is
trained in an offline manner and new parameters can be quickly generated on the
fly, after training is complete. This work utilizes such a workflow to enable
the rapid parameterization of a ductile damage model called TEPLA with a
machine learning inverse model. The machine learning model can estimate
parameters in under a second while a traditional approach takes hundreds of CPU
hours. The results demonstrate good accuracy on a held-out, synthetic test
dataset and is validated against experimental data.

<h3>Evolution of $1/f$ Flux Noise in Superconducting Qubits with Weak  Magnetic Fields</h3>

<br>
<br>
The microscopic origin of $1/f$ magnetic flux noise in superconducting
circuits has remained an open question for several decades despite extensive
experimental and theoretical investigation. Recent progress in superconducting
devices for quantum information has highlighted the need to mitigate sources of
qubit decoherence, driving a renewed interest in understanding the underlying
noise mechanism(s). Though a consensus has emerged attributing flux noise to
surface spins, their identity and interaction mechanisms remain unclear,
prompting further study. Here we apply weak in-plane magnetic fields to a
capacitively-shunted flux qubit (where the Zeeman splitting of surface spins
lies below the device temperature) and study the flux-noise-limited qubit
dephasing, revealing previously unexplored trends that may shed light on the
dynamics behind the emergent $1/f$ noise. Notably, we observe an enhancement
(suppression) of the spin-echo (Ramsey) pure dephasing time in fields up to
$B=100~\text{G}$. With direct noise spectroscopy, we further observe a
transition from a $1/f$ to approximately Lorentzian frequency dependence below
10 Hz and a reduction of the noise above 1 MHz with increasing magnetic field.
We suggest that these trends are qualitatively consistent with an increase of
spin cluster sizes with magnetic field. These results should help to inform a
complete microscopic theory of $1/f$ flux noise in superconducting circuits.

The electromagnetic coupling between hetero-structures made of different
materials is of great interest, both from the perspective of discovering new
phenomena, as well as for its potential applications in novel devices. In this
work, we study the electromagnetic coupling of a hetero-structure made of a
topological insulator (TI) slab and a single graphene layer, where the later
presents a diluted concentration of ionized impurities. We explore the
topological effects of the magneto-electric polarizability (MEP) of the TI, as
well as its relative dielectric permittivity on the electrical conductivity in
graphene at low but finite temperatures.

<br>
<br>
We report $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of ultra-dilute
$^{8}$Li$^{+}$ implanted in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The
absence of motional narrowing and diffusional spin-lattice relaxation implies
Li$^+$ is not appreciably mobile up to 400 K, in sharp contrast to the highly
lithiated stage compounds. However, the relaxation is remarkably fast and
persists down to cryogenic temperatures. Ruling out extrinsic paramagnetic
impurities and intrinsic ferromagnetism, we conclude the relaxation is due to
paramagnetic centers correlated with implantation. While the resulting effects
are not consistent with a Kondo impurity, they also differ from free
paramagnetic centers, and we suggest that a resonant scattering approach may
account for much of the observed phenomenology.

Conventional lithium-ion batteries, and many next-generation technologies,
rely on organic electrolytes with multiple solvents to achieve the desired
physicochemical and interfacial properties. The complex interplay between these
physicochemical and interfacial properties can often be elucidated via the
coordination environment of the cation. We develop a theory for the
coordination shell of cations in non-aqueous solvent mixtures that can be
applied with high fidelity, up to very high salt concentrations. Our theory can
naturally explain simulation and literature values of cation solvation in
"classical" non-aqueous electrolytes. Moreover, we utilise our theory to
understand general design principles of emerging classes of non-aqueous
electrolyte mixtures. It is hoped that this theory provides a systematic
framework to understand simulations and experiments which engineer the
solvation structure and ionic associations of concentrated non-aqueous
electrolytes.

The discovery of correlated phases in twisted bilayer graphene accelerated
the search for low-dimensional materials with exotic electronic properties. A
promising approach uses engineered substrates to strain the material and modify
the electron dynamics. However, designing substrates for tailored properties
remains beyond reach due to an incomplete understanding of the relationship
between substrate's shapes and electronic properties. The study of effective
Dirac models for electrons in graphene under periodic deformations with
different symmetries and generic profiles provides the answer. We identify
conditions for the emergence of gaps and isolated flat bands, and obtain
spatial charge distributions. We also elucidate specific geometrical features
that produce percolating states and associated topological bands, and discuss
the implications for interpreting local experimental observations.

The accumulation of plastic deformation and flow localization in amorphous
alloys under periodic shear are investigated using molecular dynamics
simulations. We study a well-annealed binary mixture of one million atoms
subjected to oscillatory shear deformation with strain amplitudes slightly
above a critical value. We find that upon approaching a critical strain
amplitude from above, the number of shear cycles until the yielding transition
is well described by a power-law function. Remarkably, the potential energy at
the end of each cycle as a function of the normalized number of cycles is
nearly independent of the strain amplitude, which allows for estimation of the
fatigue lifetime at a given strain amplitude. The analysis on nonaffine
displacements of atoms elucidates the process of strain localization, including
irreversible rearrangements of small clusters until the formation of a
system-spanning shear band.

<h3>Exciton condensation in biased bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Harley D. Scammell, Oleg P. Sushkov</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider suspened bilayer graphene under applied perpendicular electric
bias field that is known to generate a single particle gap $2\Delta$ and a
related electric polarization ${\cal P}$. We argue that the bias also drives a
quantum phase transition from band insulator to superfluid exciton condensate.
The transition occurs when the exciton binding energy exceeds the band gap
$2\Delta$. We predict the critical bias (converted to band gap),
$\Delta_c\approx 60$ meV, below which the excitons condense. The critical
temperature, $T_c(\Delta)$, is maximum at $\Delta \approx 25$ meV,
$T_c^\text{max}\approx 115$ K, decreasing significantly at smaller $\Delta$ due
to thermal screening. Entering the condensate phase, the superfluid transition
is accompanied by a cusp in the electric polarization ${\cal P}(\Delta)$ at
$\Delta\to\Delta_c$, which provides a striking testable signature.
Additionally, we find that the condensate prefers to form a pair density wave.

<br>
<br>
We present a mathematical analysis of the spin-constrained Hartree-Fock
solutions (CHF) of the 2-site Hubbard model. The analysis sheds light on the
spin symmetry breaking process around the Coulson-Fischer point. CHF states are
useful as input states for the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) in which CHF
states can be used as a basis for multiconfigurational calculations in the
Hill-Wheeler equations. The spin degree of freedom provides the generator
coordinate in the GCM related to static electron correlation.

<h3>First-principles study of $d^0$ magnetism in group-IV-doped monolayer  GaN</h3>

<br>
<i>Rui Zhao, Rui Guo, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu, Wenhui Wan</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, the structural and magnetic properties of group-IV-doped
monolayer GaN were systematically investigated by first-principles
calculations. Among all the group-IV dopants, only Ge and Sn atoms prefer to
substitute the Ga atom of monolayer GaN and form a buckling structure with a
magnetic moment of 1 $\mu_B$ per dopant. The N-rich growth conditions are more
desirable for such a substitution process than the Ga-rich grow conditions.
With a large diffusion barrier vertical to the monolayer GaN, both Ge and Sn
atoms tend to stay on the same side of monolayer GaN with an antiferromagnetic
coupling between them. When intrinsic vacancies exist in monolayer GaN, the
magnetic moments of group-IV dopants vanish due to the charge transferring from
the dopants to Ga or N vacancies. The precondition creation of Ga vacancies, a
plentiful supply of Ge or Sn dopants, and the N-rich conditions can be adopted
to maintain the magnetic properties of group-IV-doped monolayer GaN. These
theoretical results help to promote the applications of 2D GaN-based materials
in spintronics.

Structures with artificial mechanical properties, often called mechanical
metamaterials, exhibit divergent yet tunable performance. Various types of
mechanical metamaterials have been proposed, which harness light or magnetic
interactions, structural instabilities in slender or hollow structures, and
contact friction. However, most of the designs are precisely engineered without
any imperfections, in order to perform as programmed. Here, we study the
mechanical performance of randomly stacked cylindrical-shells, which act as a
disordered mechanical metamaterial. Combining experiments and simulations, we
demonstrate that the stacked shells can absorb and store mechanical energy upon
compression by exploiting large deformation and relocation of shells,
snap-fits, and friction. Although shells are oriented randomly, the system
exhibits robust mechanical performance controlled by friction and geometry. Our
results demonstrate that the rearrangement of flexible components could yield
versatile but predictive mechanical responses.

<h3>Unusual anisotropic magnetoresistance due to magnetization-dependent  spin-orbit interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07886" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07886</a>
<br>
<i>M. Q. Dong, Zhi-Xin Guo, X. R. Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
One of recent surprising discoveries is the unusual anisotropic
magnetoresistance (UAMR) that depends on two magnetization components
perpendicular to the current differently, in contrast to the conventional
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) that predicts no change in resistance when
the magnetization varies in the plane perpendicular to the current. Using
density functional theory and Boltzmann transport equation calculations for bcc
Fe, hcp Co, and bcc FeCo alloys, we show that UAMR can be accounted by the
magnetization-dependent spin-orbit interactions (SOI): Magnetization-dependent
SOI modifies electron energy bands that, in turn, changes resistance. A
phenomenological model reveals the intrinsic connection between SOI and
order-parameters. Such a mechanism is confirmed by the strong biaxial stain
effect on UAMR. Our findings provide an efficient way of searching and
optimizing materials with large UAMR, important in the design of
high-performance spintronic devices.

<h3>Simulation of environmental impacts on the synthesis of carbyne with  more than 6000 atoms for emerging continuously tunable energy barriers in  CNT-based transistors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Transistors made up of carbon nanotubes CNT have demonstrated excellent
current-voltage characteristics which outperform some high-grade silicon-based
transistors. A continuously tunable energy barrier across semiconductor
interfaces is desired to make the CNT-based transistors more robust. Despite
the direct band gap of carbyne inside a CNT can be widely tuned by strain, the
size of carbyne cannot be controlled easily. The production of a monoatomic
chain with more than 6000 carbon atoms is an enormous technological challenge.
To predict the optimal chain length of a carbyne in different molecular
environments, we have developed a Monte Carlo model in which a finite-length
carbyne with a size of 4000-15000 atoms is encapsulated by a CNT at finite
temperatures. Our simulation shows that the stability of the carbyne@nanotube
is strongly influenced by the nature and porosity of the CNT, the external
pressure, the temperature and the chain length. We have observed an initiation
of chain-breaking process in a compressed carbyne@nanotube. Our work provides
much needed input for optimising the carbyne length to produce carbon chains
much longer than 6000 atoms at ~300K. Design rules are proposed for
synthesizing ~1% strained carbyne@(6,5)CNT as a component in CNT-based
transistors to tune the energy barriers continuously.

<h3>Non-Invertible Duality Transformation Between SPT and SSB Phases</h3>

<br>
<br>
In 1992, Kennedy and Tasaki constructed a non-local unitary transformation
that maps between a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ spontaneously symmetry
breaking phase and the Haldane gap phase, which is a prototypical
Symmetry-Protected Topological phase in modern framework, on an open spin
chain. In this work, we propose a way to define it on a closed chain, by
sacrificing unitarity. The operator realizing such a non-unitary transformation
satisfies non-invertible fusion rule, and implements a generalized gauging of
the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ global symmetry. Along the way, we also
show that the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation, which is well-known to be
non-unitary and satisfy the non-invertible fusion rule on a closed chain, can
instead be realized as a unitary transformation on an open chain.

Understanding charge motion in a background of interacting quantum spins is a
fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics. The most extensively studied
model for this problem is the so-called $t$-$t'$-$t''$-$J$ model, where the
determination of the parameter $t'$ in the context of cuprate superconductors
is challenging. Here we present a theoretical study of the spectral functions
of a mobile hole in the $t$-$t'$-$t''$-$J$ model using two machine learning
techniques: K-nearest Neighbors regression (KNN) and a feed-forward neural
network (FFNN). We employ the self-consistent Born approximation to generate a
dataset of about $1.3 \times 10^5$ spectral functions. We show that for the
forward problem, both methods allow for the accurate and efficient prediction
of spectral functions, allowing for e.g. rapid searches through parameter
space. Furthermore, we find that for the inverse problem (inferring Hamiltonian
parameters from spectra), the FFNN can, but the KNN cannot, accurately predict
the model parameters using merely the density-of-state. Our results suggest
that it may be possible to use deep learning methods to predict materials
parameters from experimentally measured spectral functions.

Cell membranes phase separate into ordered ${\rm L_o}$ and disordered ${\rm
L_d}$ domains depending on their compositions. This membrane
compartmentalization is heterogeneous and regulates the localization of
specific proteins related to cell signaling and trafficking. However, it is
unclear how the heterogeneity of the membranes affects the diffusion and
localization of proteins in ${\rm L_o}$ and ${\rm L_d}$ domains. Here, using
Langevin dynamics simulations coupled with the phase-field method (LDPF), we
investigate submillisecond-scale diffusion and localization of proteins in
heterogeneous biological membrane models showing phase separation into ${\rm
L_o}$ and ${\rm L_d}$ domains. The diffusivity of proteins exhibits temporal
fluctuations depending on the field composition. Increases in molecular
concentrations and domain preference of the molecule induce subdiffusive
behavior due to molecular collisions by crowding and confinement effects,
respectively. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate that the protein
partitioning into the ${\rm L_o}$ domain is determined by the difference in
molecular diffusivity between domains, molecular preference of domain, and
molecular concentration. These results pave the way for understanding how
biological reactions caused by molecular partitioning may be controlled in
heterogeneous media.

<br>
The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquids incorporate to the
functional combination of fluidity, processability and anisotropic optical
properties of nematic liquids, an astonishing range of physical properties
derived from the phase polarity. Among them, the remarkably large values of
second order optical susceptibility encourage to exploit these new materials
for non-linear photonic applications. Here we show that photopatterning of the
alignment layer can be used to structure polarization patterns. To do so, we
take advantage of the flexoelectric effect and design splay structures that
geometrically define the polarization direction. We demonstrate the creation of
periodic polarization structures and the possibility of guiding polarization by
embedding splay structures in uniform backgrounds. The demonstrated
capabilities of polarization patterning, open a promising new route for the
design of ferroelectric nematic based photonic structures and their
exploitation.

I theoretically propose an emergence of nonlinear nonreciprocal transport in
centrosymmetric magnets with topological spin textures. By focusing on the
stacking degree of freedom of the skyrmion crystals on a layered triangular
lattice, I find that the ABC-stacking structure of the skyrmion crystals gives
rise to out-of-plane nonreciprocal transport without the relativistic
spin-orbit coupling. I show that such nonreciprocal transport is caused by an
asymmetric band modulation due to the stacking structure, where the scalar
chirality across the layers is a key ingredient. I also show an effective spin
model to stabilize the ABC-stacking skyrmion structure. The present results
indicate that the stacking structure of the skyrmion crystal becomes a source
of further intriguing transport properties.

Hexagonal MnTe emerges as a critical component in designing magnetic quantum
heterostructures, calling for a detailed study. After finding a suitable
combination of exchange-correlation functional and corrections, our study
within {\em ab initio} density functional theory uncovers an insulating state
with a preferred antiferromagnetic order. We compute the exchange interaction
strengths to estimate the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature via Monte
Carlo calculations. Our calculations and symmetry analysis reveal a large spin
splitting in the system due to the antiferromagnetic order without considering
spin-orbit interaction, except in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane. Critically examining
the band dispersion and spin textures obtained from our calculations and
comparing them with an insightful symmetry analysis and analytical model, we
confirm a combined Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane,
around the K point of the system. Finally, we find ferroelectricity in the
system for a higher energy magnetic configuration. Our results and insights
would help design heterostructures of MnTe for technological applications.

We present a theoretical study of a mixture of antidipolar and nondipolar
Bose-Einstein condensates confined to an infinite tube. The long-ranged
inverted dipolar interactions result in a spin roton instability associated
with an unmodulated-to-supersolid phase transition. We present a phase diagram
including unmodulated miscible, supersolid, incoherent domain, and macroscopic
domain phases. The low densities of the binary mixture do not require
beyond-mean-field quantum fluctuation corrections for stabilization. Our survey
ranges from the quasi-1D to the radial Thomas-Fermi (elongated 3D) regimes. We

<br>
<br>
EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is now widely accepted as a topological semimetal in which a
Weyl phase is induced by an external magnetic field. We challenge this view
through firm experimental evidence using a combination of electronic transport,
optical spectroscopy and excited-state photoemission spectroscopy. We show that
the EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is in fact a semiconductor with a gap of 0.77 eV. We show
that the externally applied magnetic field has a profound impact on the
electronic band structure of this system. This is manifested by a huge decrease
of the band gap, as large as 125 meV at 2~T, and consequently, by a giant
redshift of the interband absorption edge. However, the semiconductor nature of
the material remains preserved. EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is therefore a magnetic
semiconductor rather than a Dirac or Weyl semimetal, as suggested by {\em ab

Gold is one of the most inert metals, forming very few compounds, some with
rather interesting properties, and only two of them currently known to be
superconducting under certain conditions (AuTe$_2$ and SrAuSi$_3$). Compounds
of another noble element, Ag, are also relatively rare, and very few of them
are superconducting. Finding new superconducting materials containing gold (and
silver) is a challenge - especially having in mind that the best high-$T_c$
superconductors at normal conditions are based upon their rather close
''relative'', Cu. Here we report combined X-ray diffraction, Raman, and
resistivity measurements, as well as first-principles calculations, to explore
the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the properties of the sylvanite mineral,
AuAgTe$_4$. Our experimental results, supported by density functional theory,
reveal a structural phase transition at $\sim$5 GPa from a monoclinic $P2/c$ to
$P2/m$ phase, resulting in almost identical coordinations of Au and Ag ions,
with rather uniform interatomic distances. Further, resistivity measurements
show the onset of superconductivity at $\sim$1.5 GPa in the $P2/c$ phase,
followed by a linear increase of $T_c$ up to the phase transition, with a
maximum in the $P2/m$ phase, and a gradual decrease afterwards. Our
calculations indicate phonon-mediated superconductivity, with the
electron-phonon coupling coming predominantly from the low-energy phonon modes.
Thus, along with the discovery of a new superconducting compound of
gold/silver, our results advance understanding of the mechanism of the
superconductivity in Au-containing compounds, which may pave the way to the
discovery of novel ones.

We discuss the decomposition of the tensorial relaxation function for
isotropic and transversely isotropic Modified Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic models.
We show how to formulate the constitutive equation by using a convenient
decomposition of the relaxation tensor into scalar components and tensorial
bases. We show that the bases must be symmetrically additive, i.e they must sum
up to the symmetric fourth-order identity tensor. This is a fundamental
property both for isotropic and anisotropic bases that ensures the constitutive
equation is consistent with the elastic limit. We provide two robust methods to
obtain such bases. Furthermore, we show that, in the transversely isotropic
case, the bases are naturally deformation-dependent for deformation modes that
induce rotation or stretching of the fibres. Therefore, the Modified
Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic framework allows to capture the non-linear phenomenon
of strain-dependent relaxation, which has always been a criticised limitation
of the original Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic theory. We illustrate this intrinsic
non-linear feature, unique to the Modified Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic model,
with two examples (uni-axial extension and perpendicular shear).

<br>
<br>
Glass hardness varies in a non-linear fashion with the chemical composition
and applied load, a phenomenon known as the indentation size effect (ISE),
which is challenging to predict quantitatively. Here, using a curated dataset
of over approx. 3000 inorganic glasses from the literature comprising the
composition, indentation load, and hardness, we develop machine learning (ML)
models to predict the composition and load dependence of Vickers hardness.
Interestingly, when tested on new glass compositions unseen during the
training, the standard data-driven ML model failed to capture the ISE. To
address this gap, we combined an empirical expression (Bernhardt law) to
describe the ISE with ML to develop a framework that incorporates the symbolic
law representing the domain reasoning in ML, namely Symbolic Reasoning-Informed
ML Procedure (SRIMP). We show that the resulting SRIMP outperforms the
data-driven ML model in predicting the ISE. Finally, we interpret the SRIMP
model to understand the contribution of the glass network formers and modifiers
toward composition and load-dependent (ISE) and load-independent hardness. The
deconvolution of the hardness into load-dependent and load-independent terms
paves the way toward a holistic understanding of composition and ISE in
glasses, enabling the accelerated discovery of new glass compositions with
targeted hardness.

We analyze the scaled voter model, which is a generalization of the noisy
voter model with time-dependent herding behavior. We consider the case when the
intensity of herding behavior grows as a power-law function of time. In this
case, the scaled voter model reduces to the usual noisy voter model, but it is
driven by the scaled Brownian motion. We derive analytical expressions for the
time evolution of the first and second moments of the scaled voter model. In
addition, we have derived an analytical approximation of the first passage time
distribution. By numerical simulation, we confirm our analytical results as
well as show that the model exhibits long-range memory indicators despite being
a Markov model. The proposed model has steady-state distribution consistent
with the bounded fractional Brownian motion, thus we expect it to be a good
substitute model for the bounded fractional Brownian motion.

A distinguishing feature of ultracold collisions of bosonic lithium atoms is
the presence of two near-degenerate two-body continua. The influence of such a
near-degeneracy on the few-body physics in the vicinity of a narrow Feshbach
resonance is investigated within the framework of a minimal model with two
atomic continua and one closed molecular channel. The model allows analysis of
the spin composition of loosely bound dimers and trimers. In the two-body
sector the well-established coupled-channels calculations phenomenology of
lithium is qualitatively reproduced, and its particularities are emphasized and
clarified. In the three-body sector we find that the Efimov trimer energy
levels follow a different functional form as compared to a single continuum
scenario while the thresholds remain untouched. This three-channel model with
two atomic continua complements our earlier developed three-channel model with
two molecular channels [Y. Yudkin and L. Khaykovich, Phys. Rev. A 103, 063303
(2021)] and suggests that the experimentally observed exotic behavior of the
first excited Efimov energy level [Y. Yudkin, R. Elbaz and L. Khaykovich,
arXiv:2004.02723] is most probably caused by the short-range details of the
interaction potential.

Materials with strong electronic correlations may exhibit a superconducting
(SC) phase when tuning some parameters, but they almost always also have
multiple other phases, typically insulating ones, that are in close competition
with SC. It is highly challenging to resolve this competition with quantitative
numerics for the group of quasi-two-dimensional materials such as the cuprates.
This is the case even for the simplified minimal models of these materials, the
doped 2D Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, where clusters of
sufficient size to determine the phase in the thermodynamic limit can be
hard-to-impossible to treat in practice. The present work shows how
quasi-one-dimensional systems, 2D and 3D arrays of weakly coupled 1D correlated
electrons, are much more amenable to resolve the competition between SC and
insulating orders on an equal footing using matrix-product states (MPS). Using
the recently established MPS plus mean field (MPS+MF) approach for fermions, we
demonstrate that large systems are readily reachable in these systems, and thus
the thermodynamic regime by extrapolation. Focusing on basic model systems, 3D
arrays of negative-U Hubbard chains with additional nearest-neighbor
interaction V, we show that despite the MF component of the MPS+MF technique we
can reproduce the expected coexistence of SC and charge-density wave at V=0 for
density n=1. We then show how we can tune away from coexistence by both tuning
V and doping the system. This work paves the way to deploy two-channel MPS+MF
theory on some highly demanding high-$T_c$ SC systems, such as 3D arrays of
repulsive-U doped Hubbard ladders, where we have recently characterized the
properties of such arrays in single-channel MPS+MF calculations. The present
approach could thus conclusively show that this SC order would actually be
obtained, by explicitly comparing SC against its insulating competitors.

In a recent experiment [Trishin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 236801 (2021)]
a rich physics was observed for Fe atoms on MoS$_2$/Au(111), characterized by
three different behaviors depending on the spectral density of the substrate:
one dominated by a single ion anisotropy, one by the Kondo effect, and an
intermediate one. Different theoretical approaches were proposed for the three
regimes. We show that the different behaviors can be explained in a unified
fashion by an anisotropic two-channel spin-1 Kondo model, which has an
underlying topological quantum phase transition between an ordinary Fermi
liquid and a non-Landau one. Further experiments could confirm this transition.

<h3>Boundary Chaos: Exact Entanglement Dynamics</h3>

We compute the dynamics of entanglement in the minimal setup producing
ergodic and mixing quantum many-body dynamics, which we previously dubbed {\em
boundary chaos}. This consists of a free, non-interacting brickwork quantum
circuit, in which chaos and ergodicity is induced by an impurity interaction,
i.e., an entangling two-qudit gate, placed at the system's boundary. We compute
both the conventional bipartite entanglement entropy with respect to a
connected subsystem including the impurity interaction for initial product
states as well as the so-called operator entanglement entropy of initial local
operators. Thereby we provide exact results in a particular scaling limit of
both time and system size going to infinity for either very small or very large
subsystems. We show that different classes of impurity interactions lead to
very distinct entanglement dynamics. For impurity gates preserving a local
product state forming the bulk of the initial state, entanglement entropies of
states show persistent spikes with period set by the system size and suppressed
entanglement in between, contrary to the expected linear growth in ergodic
systems. We observe similar dynamics of operator entanglement for generic
impurities. In contrast, for T-dual impurities, which remain unitary under
partial transposition, we find entanglement entropies of both states and
operators to grow linearly in time with the maximum possible speed allowed by
the geometry of the system. The intensive nature of interactions in all cases
cause entanglement to grow on extensive time scales proportional to system
size.

High data acquisition rates and low-noise detection of ultracold neutral
atoms present important challenges for the state tomography and interferometric
application of entangled quantum states in Bose-Einstein condensates. In this
article, we present a high-flux source of $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensates
combined with a number-resolving detection. We create Bose-Einstein condensates
of $2\times10^5$ atoms with no discernible thermal fraction within $3.3$ s
using a hybrid evaporation approach in a magnetic/optical trap. For the
high-fidelity tomography of many-body quantum states in the spin degree of
freedom [arXiv:2207.01270], it is desirable to select a single mode for a
number-resolving detection. We demonstrate the low-noise selection of
subsamples of up to $16$ atoms and their subsequent detection with a counting
noise below $0.2$ atoms. The presented techniques offer an exciting path
towards the creation and analysis of mesoscopic quantum states with
unprecedented fidelities, and their exploitation for fundamental and
metrological applications.

We compute the diagrammatic expansion of the particle-particle susceptibility
via algorithmic Matsubara integration and compute the correlated pairing
susceptibility in the 2D Hubbard Model. We study the static susceptibility and
its dependence on the pair momentum $\mathbf{q}$ for a range of temperature,
interaction strength and chemical potential. We show that $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave
pairing is expected in the model in the $U/t\to 0^+ $ limit from direct
perturbation theory. From this, we identify key second and third-order diagrams
that support pairing processes. We find two key components for pairing at
momenta $(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$ that can be well fit as separate bosonic modes.
We extract amplitudes and correlation length scales where we find a
predominantly local $(\pi,\pi)$ pairing and non-local $\mathbf{q}=(0,0)$ pairs
and present the relative weights of these modes for variation in temperature,
doping, and interaction strength.

Over the decades, the spin dynamics of a large set of lanthanide complexes
have been explored. Lanthanide-based molecular nanomagnets are bistable spin
systems, generally conceptualized as classical bits, but many lanthanide
complexes have also been presented as candidate quantum bits (qubits). Here we
offer a third alternative and model them as probabilistic bits (p-bits), where
their stochastic behavior constitutes a computational resource instead of a
limitation. We present a modelling tool for molecular spin p-bits, we
demonstrate its capability to simulate bulk magnetic relaxation data and ac
experiments and to simulate a minimal p-bit network under realistic conditions.
Finally, we go back to a recent systematic data gathering and screen the best
lanthanide complexes for p-bit behavior, lay out the performance of the
different lanthanide ions and chemical families and offer some chemical design
considerations.

Magnetic skyrmions are compact chiral spin textures that exhibit a rich
variety of topological phenomena and hold potential for developing high-density
memory devices and novel computing schemes driven by spin currents. Here, we
demonstrate room temperature interfacial stabilization and current-driven
control of skyrmion bubbles in the ferrimagnetic insulator Tm3Fe5O12 (TmIG)
coupled to Pt. We track the current-induced motion of individual skyrmion
bubbles. The ferrimagnetic order of the crystal together with the interplay of
spin-orbit torques and pinning determine the skyrmion dynamics in TmIG and
result in a strong skyrmion Hall effect characterized by a negative deflection
angle and hopping motion. Further, we show that the velocity and depinning
threshold of the skyrmion bubbles can be modified by exchange coupling TmIG to
an in-plane magnetized Y3Fe5O12 layer, which distorts the spin texture of the
skyrmions and leads to a directional-dependent rectification of their dynamics.
This effect, which is equivalent to a magnetic ratchet, is exploited to control
the skyrmion flow in a racetrack-like device.

<h3>Dynamical scaling laws in the quantum $q$-state clock chain</h3>

<br>

We show that phase transitions in the quantum $q$-state clock model for $q
\leq 4$ can be characterized by a decay enhanced behavior of the Loschmidt echo
via a small quench. The quantum criticality of the quantum $q$-state clock
model is numerically investigated by the finite-size scaling of the first
minimum of the Loschmidt echo and the short-time average of rate function. The
equilibrium correlation length critical exponents that are obtained from the
scaling laws are consistent with previous results. More importantly, we study
dynamical quantum phase transitions in the quantum $q$-state clock model by
analyzing the Loschmidt echo and the order parameter for any $q$ upon a big
quench. For $q \leq 4$, we show that dynamical quantum phase transitions can be
described by the Loschmidt echo and the zeros of the order parameter. In
particular, we find the rate function increases logarithmically with $q$ at the
first critical time $t_{c1}$. However, for $q > 4$, we do not find a convincing
evidence of a relationship between the Loschmidt echo and the zeros of the
order parameter for dynamical quantum phase transitions. The Loschmidt echo
near its first minimum seems to converge, while the order parameter at its
first zero increases linearly with $q$.

<h3>Mixed State Entanglement Measures in Topological Orders</h3>

We study two mixed state entanglement measures in topological orders: the
so-called "computable cross-norm or realignment" (CCNR) negativity, and the
more well-known partial-transpose (PT) negativity, both of which are based on
separability criteria. We first compute the CCNR negativity between two spatial
regions for tripartite pure states in (2+1)D Chern-Simons (CS) theories using
the surgery method, and compare to the previous results on PT negativity. Under
certain simplifying conditions, we find general expressions of both mixed state
entanglement measures and relate them to the entanglement entropies of
different subregions. Then we derive general formulas for both CCNR and PT
negativities in the Pauli stabilizer formalism, which is applicable to lattice
models in all spatial dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate our results in the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code model. For tripartitions without trisection points,
we provide a strategy of extracting the provably topological and universal
terms in both entanglement measures. In the presence of trisection points, our
result suggests that the subleading piece in the CCNR negativity is
topological, while that for PT is not and depends on the local geometry of the
trisections.

Bimetallic nanostructures combining plasmonic and catalytic metals are
promising for tailoring and enhancing plasmonic hot-carrier generation utilized
in plasmonic catalysis. In this work, we study the plasmonic hot-carrier
generation in noble metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au, Cu) with single-atom dopants
(Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt) with first-principles time-dependent density-functional
theory calculations. Our results show that the local hot-carrier generation at
the dopant atom is significantly altered by the dopant element while the
plasmonic response of the nanoparticle as a whole is not significantly
affected. In particular, hot holes at the dopant atom originate from the
discrete d-electron states of the dopant. The energies of these d-electron
states, and hence those of the hot holes, depend on the dopant element, which
opens up the possibility to tune hot-carrier generation with suitable dopants.

Three-dimensional, crystalline Hopf insulators are generic members of unitary
Wigner-Dyson class, which can break all global discrete symmetries and point
group symmetries. In the absence of first Chern number for any two-dimensional
plane of Brillouin zone, the Hopf invariant $N_H \in \mathbb{Z}$. But in the
presence of Chern number $N_H \in \mathbb{Z}_{2q}$, where $q$ is the greatest
common divisor of Chern numbers for $xy$, $yz$, and $xz$ planes of Brillouin
zone. How does $N_H$ affect topological quantization of isotropic,
magneto-electric coefficient? We answer this question with calculations of
Witten effect for a test, magnetic monopole. Furthermore, we construct $N$-band
tight-binding models of Hopf insulators and demonstrate their topological
stability against spectral flattening.

<h3>Identifying Many-Body Localization in Realistic Dot Arrays</h3>

We determine whether or not it is possible to identify many-body localization
in quantum dot arrays, given their current technological capacities. We analyze
the phase diagram of an extended Fermi-Hubbard model - a theoretical system
that quantum dot arrays are known to simulate - using several quantities of
varying experimental accessibility. By deriving the parameters of our model
from our experimental system, we find that many-body localization can
potentially be detected in current-generation quantum dot arrays. A pitfall
that we identify is that the freezing of a system due to strong interactions
yields signatures similar to conventional localization. We find that the most
widely-used experimental signature of localization - the imbalance - is not
sensitive to this fact, and may be unsuitable as the lone identifier of the
many-body localized regime.
