<p>Colloids dispersed in nematic liquid crystals form topological composites in
which colloid-associated defects mediate interactions while adhering to
fundamental topological constraints. Better realising the promise of such
materials requires numerical methods that model nematic inclusions in dynamic
and complex scenarios. We employ a mesoscale approach for simulating colloids
as mobile surfaces embedded in a fluctuating nematohydrodynamic medium to study
the kinetics of colloidal entanglement. In addition to reproducing far-field
interactions, topological properties of disclination loops are resolved to
reveal their metastable states and topological transitions during relaxation
towards ground state. The intrinsic hydrodynamic fluctuations distinguish
formerly unexplored far-from-equilibrium disclination states, including
configurations with localised positive winding profiles. The adaptability and
precision of this numerical approach offers promising avenues for studying the
dynamics of colloids and topological defects in designed and out-of-equilibrium
situations.

<h3>A simple mathematical theory for Simple Volatile Memristors and their  spiking circuits</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08647" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08647</a>
<br>
</p><i>T. M. Kamsma, R. van Roij, C. Spitoni</i>
<p>In pursuit of neuromorphic (brain-inspired) devices, memristors
(memory-resistors) have emerged as promising candidates for emulating neuronal
circuitry. Here we mathematically define a class of Simple Volatile Memristors
(SVMs), which notably includes various fluidic iontronic devices that have
recently garnered significant interest due to their unique quality of operating
within the same medium as the brain. We show that symmetric SVMs produce non
self-crossing current-voltage hysteresis loops, while simple asymmetric SVMs
produce self-crossing loops. Additionally, we derive a general expression for
the enclosed area in a loop, providing a relation between the voltage frequency
and the SVM memory timescale. These general results are shown to materialise in
physical finite-element calculations of microfluidic memristors. An SVM-based
circuit has been proposed that exhibits all-or-none and tonic neuronal spiking.
We generalise and analyse this spiking circuit, characterising it as a
two-dimensional dynamical system. Additionally, we demonstrate that stochastic
effects can induce novel neuronal firing modes absent in the deterministic
case. Through our analysis, the circuit dynamics are well understood, while
retaining its explicit link with the physically plausible underlying system.

<h3>Note: Applying the Brillouin Zone and Band Gap Leveraging AB Initio  Calculation for Digital Well-Being: In-Depth Analysis of Band Structures in  Information Spaces Insights from Solid-State Physics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08649" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08649</a>

</p><i>Yasuko Kawahata</i>
<p>The efforts of this Note are aimed at understanding various phenomena in
digital space that are incomplete and difficult to define, and to translate
them into language from research fields that are based on existing large-scale
experimental data. Information diffusion and user behavior patterns in digital
space are often hard to intuitively capture, and the principles and mechanisms
behind them are difficult to articulate. To address this challenge, we have
drawn on first-principles methods in physics, particularly solid state physics.
This approach is known to be effective in analyzing the behavior of real
physical materials at the atomic level and in understanding the electronic
properties and bonding structures of materials. We have attempted to apply
physical concepts based on first-principles calculations, in particular
concepts such as first Brillouin zones, band gaps, and reciprocal lattice
vectors, to digital space as a metaphor. This theoretical framework allows us
to quantitatively and logically infer the behavior and trends of incomplete and
ambiguous digital data and phenomena. For example, the "first Brillouin zone"
of information in digital media indicates the potential sphere of influence of
that information, and the band gap defines the threshold of influence for the
information to be widely accepted. In addition, the reciprocal lattice vector
serves as a boundary that indicates the limits of information characteristics
and is an indicator of the degree to which a particular piece of information
resonates with users. With this theoretical supplement, our research goes
beyond the mere analysis of phenomena in the digital space and provides new
methods for understanding and predicting the behavior of imperfect data and
uncertain digital media.

<p>Establishing quantitative correlations between various molecular properties
and chemical structures is of great technological importance for environmental
and medical aspects. These approaches are referred to as Quantitative
Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR), which relate the physicochemical or
thermodynamic properties of compounds to their structures. The main goal of
QSPR studies is to find a mathematical relationship between the property of
interest and several molecular descriptors derived from the structure of the
molecule. Topological indices are the molecular descriptors that characterize
the formation of chemical compounds and predict certain physicochemical
properties. In this study, the QSPR models are designed using certain
temperature-based topological indices such as the sum connectivity temperature
index, product connectivity temperature index, F-temperature index, and
symmetric division temperature index to predict the thermodynamic properties,
such as enthalpies of formation ($\Delta H^{0}_{f}$ \hspace{1mm} liquid),
enthalpies of combustion ($\Delta H^{0}_{C}$ \hspace{1mm} liquid), and
enthalpies of vaporization ($\Delta H^{0}_{vap}$ \hspace{1mm} gas) of
monocarboxylic acids ($C_2H_{4}O_{2}$ - $C_{20}H_{40}O_{2}$). The relationship
analysis between thermodynamic properties and topological indices is done using
linear, quadratic, and cubic equations of a curvilinear regression model. These
regression models are then compared.

<h3>Analysis of growth of silicon thin films on textured and non-textured  surface</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08651" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08651</a>
<br>
</p><i>S. M. Iftiquar, S. N. Riaz, S. Mahapatra</i>
<p>Hydrogenated amorphous silicon alloy films are generally deposited by radio
frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF PECVD) technique on
various types of substrates. Generally it is assumed that film quality remains
unchanged when deposited on textured or non-textured substrates. Here we
analyzed the difference in growth of thin film silicon layers when deposited in
a textured and a non-textured surface. In this investigation characteristics of
two solar cells were compared, where one cell was prepared on a textured
surface ( Cell-A) while the other prepared on a non-textured surface (Cell-B).
Defect analysis of the devices were carried out by simulation and device
modeling. It shows that the intrinsic film deposited on a textured surface was
more defective ($2.4\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$) than that deposited on a flat
surface ($3.2\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$). Although the primary differences in
these two cells were thickness of the active layer and nature of surface
texturing, the simulation results show that thin film deposited on a textured
surface may acquire an increased defect density than that deposited on a flat
surface. Lower effective flux density of $SiH_{3}$ precursors on the textured
surface can be one of the reasons for higher defect density in the film
deposited on textured surface. An Improved light coupling can be achieved by
using a thinner doped window layer. By changing the thickness from 15 nm to 3
nm, the short circuit current density increased from 16.4 mA/cm$^{2}$ to 20.96
mA/cm$^{2}$ and efficiency increased from $9.4\%$ to $12.32\%$.

<p>The discovery of materials that exhibit a metal-insulator transition (MIT) is
key to the development of multiple types of novel efficient microelectronic and
optoelectronic devices. However, identifying MIT materials is challenging due
to a combination of high computational cost of electronic structure
calculations needed to understand their mechanism, the mechanisms' complexity,
and the labor-intensive experimental validation process. To that end, we use a
machine learning classification model to rapidly screen a high-throughput
crystal structure database to identify candidate compounds exhibiting
thermally-driven MITs. We focus on three candidate oxides, Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$,
CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and identify their MIT mechanism using
high-fidelity density functional theory calculations. Then, we provide a
probabilistic estimate of which synthesis reactions may lead to their
realization. Our approach couples physics-informed machine learning, density
functional theory calculations, and machine learning-suggested synthesis to
reduce the time to discovery and synthesis of new technologically relevant
materials.

<h3>Advancing Extrapolative Predictions of Material Properties through  Learning to Learn</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08657" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08657</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kohei Noda, Araki Wakiuchi, Yoshihiro Hayashi, Ryo Yoshida</i>
<p>Recent advancements in machine learning have showcased its potential to
significantly accelerate the discovery of new materials. Central to this
progress is the development of rapidly computable property predictors, enabling
the identification of novel materials with desired properties from vast
material spaces. However, the limited availability of data resources poses a
significant challenge in data-driven materials research, particularly hindering
the exploration of innovative materials beyond the boundaries of existing data.
While machine learning predictors are inherently interpolative, establishing a
general methodology to create an extrapolative predictor remains a fundamental
challenge, limiting the search for innovative materials beyond existing data
boundaries. In this study, we leverage an attention-based architecture of
neural networks and meta-learning algorithms to acquire extrapolative
generalization capability. The meta-learners, experienced repeatedly with
arbitrarily generated extrapolative tasks, can acquire outstanding
generalization capability in unexplored material spaces. Through the tasks of
predicting the physical properties of polymeric materials and hybrid
organic--inorganic perovskites, we highlight the potential of such
extrapolatively trained models, particularly with their ability to rapidly
adapt to unseen material domains in transfer learning scenarios.

<h3>Coupling Phase Field Crystal and Field Dislocation Mechanics for a  consistent description of dislocation structure and elasticity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08658</a>
<br>
</p><i>Manas Vijay Upadhyay, Jorge Viñals</i>
<p>This work addresses differences in predicted elastic fields created by
dislocations either by the Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model, or by static Field
Dislocation Mechanics (FDM). The PFC order parameter describes the topological
content of the lattice, but it fails to correctly capture the elastic
distortion. In contrast, static FDM correctly captures the latter but requires
input about defect cores. The case of a dislocation dipole in two dimensional,
isotropic, elastic medium is studied, and a weak coupling is introduced between
the two models. The PFC model produces compact and stable dislocation cores,
free of any singularity, i.e., diffuse. The PFC predicted dislocation density
field (a measure of the topological defect content) is used as the source
(input) for the static FDM problem. This coupling allows a critical analysis of
the relative role played by configurational (from PFC) and elastic (from static
FDM) fields in the theory, and of the consequences of the lack of elastic
relaxation in the diffusive evolution of the PFC order parameter.

<h3>Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin  Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08745</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He</i>
<p>The Hubbard model at temperature above the N\'{e}el transition, despite of
being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi
surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the
understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level,
because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of
the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm
equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of
static and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional (3D) Hubbard model at
half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe
that the metal-insulator crossover state, in which antiferromagnetic spin
correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the
metallic state for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In
particular, the Widom line, corresponding to the most rapid suppression of
double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic
Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a
representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a
reliable methology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can serve
as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice
experiments.

<h3>Phase transitions of correlated systems from graph neural networks with  quantum embedding techniques</h3>

</p><i>Rishi Rao, Li Zhu</i>
<p>Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to
describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational
demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation
effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural
dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum
embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural
networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use
Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate
training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included
for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated
$d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the
use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train
neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface,
enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing
these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$,
$\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of
Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning
potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a
scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these
materials.

<h3>Stabilizing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with strong exchange bias  in PtMn/Co by magneto-ionics</h3>

<p>Electric field control of magnetic properties offers a broad and promising
toolbox for enabling ultra-low power electronics. A key challenge with high
technological relevance is to master the interplay between the magnetic
anisotropy of a ferromagnet and the exchange coupling to an adjacent
antiferromagnet. Here, we demonstrate that magneto-ionic gating can be used to
achieve a very stable out-of-plane (OOP) oriented magnetization with strong
exchange bias in samples with as-deposited preferred in-plane (IP)
magnetization. We show that the perpendicular interfacial anisotropy can be
increased by a factor of 2.2 in the stack Ta/Pt/PtMn/Co/HfO2 by applying -2.5 V
gate voltage over 3 nm HfO2, causing a reorientation of the magnetization from
IP into OOP with a strong OOP exchange bias of more than 50 mT. Comparing two
thicknesses of PtMn, we identify a notable trade-off: while thicker PtMn yields
a significantly larger exchange bias, it also results in a slower response to
ionic liquid gating. These results pave the way for post-deposition electrical
tailoring of magnetic anisotropy and exchange bias in samples requiring
significant exchange bias.

<h3>Hydroxide Transport and Mechanical Properties of Polyolefin-Based Anion  Exchange Membranes from Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mohammed Al Otmi, Ping Lin, William Schertzer, Coray M. Colina, Rampi Ramprasad, Janani Sampath</i>
<p>Anion exchange membranes are used in alkaline fuel cells and offer a
promising alternative to the more expensive proton exchange membrane fuel
cells. However, hydroxide ion conductivity in anion exchange membranes is low,
and the quest for membranes with superior ion conductivity, mechanical
robustness, and chemical stability is ongoing. In this study, we use classical
molecular dynamics simulations to study hydroxide ion transport and mechanical
properties of eight different hydrated polyolefin-based membranes, to provide a
molecular-level understanding of the structure-function relationships in these
systems. We examine the microstructure of the membranes and find that polymers
with narrow cavity size distribution have tighter packing of water molecules
around hydroxide ions. We estimate the self-diffusion coefficient of water and
hydroxide ions and find that water molecules have a higher diffusion than
hydroxide ions across all systems. The trends in hydroxide diffusion align well
with experimental conductivity measurements. Water facilitates hydroxide
diffusion, and this is clearly observed when the hydration level is varied for
the same polymer chemistry. In systems with narrow cavities and tightly bound
hydroxide ions, hydroxide diffusion is the lowest, underscoring the fact that
water channels facilitate hydroxide transport. Finally, we apply uniaxial
deformation to calculate the mechanical properties of these systems and find
that polymers with higher hydration levels show poor mechanical properties.
Atomistic molecular dynamics models can accurately capture the trade-off
between hydroxide transport and mechanical performance in anion exchange
membranes and allow us to screen new candidates more efficiently.

<h3>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Activity of MOS$_2$-rGO Composite  Synthesized via Hydrothermal Technique</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08872" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08872</a>

</p><i>Abhishek Sebastian, Pragna R</i>
<p>Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has emerged as a promising technique for
the production of clean and sustainable energy. In recent years, researchers
have been exploring various materials for efficient HER activity. In this
study, we report the synthesis of two different materials, namely MOS$_2$ and
MoS$_2$-rGO, through a hydrothermal technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD),
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were
used to characterize the materials. XRD analysis revealed the formation of
hexagonal MOS$_2$ with a high degree of crystallinity. FTIR analysis confirmed
the presence of Mo-S bonds, while Raman spectroscopy provided evidence for the
formation of MOS$_2$.To evaluate the HER activity of the materials, linear
sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed. The results showed that MOS$_2$ and
MOS$_2$-rGO had good HER activity with low onset potentials and high current
densities. The MOS$_2$-rGO material showed improved HER activity compared to
MOS$_2$, indicating the potential of graphene oxide as a co-catalyst to enhance
the performance of MOS$_2$.

<h3>Layer-by-layer connection for large area single crystal boron nitride  multilayer films</h3>

<p>Boron nitride (BN) is today considered as one of the most promising materials
for many novel applications including bright single photon emission, deep UV
opto-electronics, small sized solid-state neutron detector, and
high-performance two-dimensional materials, etc. Despite the recent successful
fabrication of large-area BN single-crystals (typically <= 5 atomic layers),
the scalable growth of thicker single-crystalline BN films still constitutes a
great challenge. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to grow large-area
multilayer single-crystal BN films by chemical vapor deposition on
face-centered cubic Fe-Ni (111) single crystal alloy thin films with different
stoichiometric phases. We show that the BN growth is greatly tunable and
improved by increasing the Fe content in single-crystal Fe-Ni (111). The
formation of pyramid-shaped multilayer BN domains with aligned orientation
enables a continuous connection following a layer-by-layer,
'first-meet-first-connect', mosaic stitching mechanism. By means of selected
area electron diffraction, micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy in the deep UV
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, the layer-by-layer
connection mechanism is unambiguously evidenced, and the stacking order has
been verified to occur as unidirectional AB and ABC stackings, i.e., in the
Bernal and rhombohedral BN phase.

<h3>Active doping controls the mode of failure in dense colloidal gels</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08880</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tingtao Zhou, John F. Brady</i>
<p>Mechanical properties of disordered materials are governed by their
underlying free energy landscape. In contrast to external fields, embedding a
small fraction of active particles within a disordered material generates
non-equilibrium internal fields, which can help to circumvent kinetic barriers
and modulate the free energy landscape. In this work, we investigate through
computer simulations how the activity of active particles alters the mechanical
response of deeply annealed polydisperse colloidal gels. We show that the 'swim
force' generated by the embedded active particles is responsible for
determining the mode of mechanical failure, i.e., brittle vs. ductile. We find,
and theoretically justify, that at a critical swim force the mechanical
properties of the gel decrease abruptly, signaling a change in the mode of
mechanical failure. The weakening of the elastic modulus above the critical
swim force results from the change in gel porosity and distribution of
attractive forces among gel particles. Below the critical swim force, the
ductility enhancement is caused by an increase of gel structural disorder.
Above the critical swim force, the gel develops a pronounced heterogeneous
structure characterized by multiple pore spaces, and the mechanical response is
controlled by dynamical heterogeneities. We contrast these results with those
of a simulated monodisperse gel that exhibits a non-monotonic trend of
ductility modulation with increasing swim force, revealing a complex interplay
between the gel energy landscape and embedded activity.

<h3>In-situ Formation of Superconducting FeTe/layered-MnTe heterostructures</h3>

</p><i>Zhihao He, Chen Ma, Jiannong Wang, Iam Keong Sou</i>
<p>Manganese telluride (MnTe) has garnered strong interest recently for its
antiferromagnetic semiconductor properties, which are promising for
applications in spintronics, data storage, and quantum computing. In this
study, we discovered that the deposition of FeTe onto zinc-blende MnTe
(ZB-MnTe) via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) results in a phase transition from
ZB-MnTe to a layered MnTe (l-MnTe) phase with van der Waals (vdW) gaps, which
is a novel phase of MnTe. The l-MnTe phase was characterized using
cross-sectional high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging,
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The FeTe/l-MnTe heterostructure exhibits high-quality
superconducting properties that closely resemble those of bulk superconducting
materials. We found that the Fe:Te ratio during FeTe deposition is critical to
the phase transition and the superconducting characteristics of the
heterostructure system. An increased Fe:Te ratio used for the FeTe growth leads
to localized formation of layered Mn4Te3 (l-Mn4Te3) and degrades the
superconductivity, while a decreased ratio may hamper the transformation from
ZB-MnTe to l-MnTe, leading to the loss of superconductivity. Most importantly,
this study reports the realization of a layered structure of MnTe by an in-situ
approach via chemical interaction, which might be further applied to generating
unprecedented phases of materials under certain conditions.

<h3>Stable phases of freestanding monolayer TiO$_2$: The emergence of  out-of-plane ferroelectricity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08924</a>

</p><i>Xiangtian Bu, Haitao Liu, Yuanchang Li</i>
<p>Despite being successfully synthesized [Zhang $et$ $al.$, Nat. Mater.
\textbf{20}, 1073 (2021)], the monolayer structure of stable hexagonal TiO$_2$
is unknown, and it is not even clear whether it can exist in a freestanding
form. Through first-principles calculations, we have identified two previously
uncharted stable structures, namely, distorted 1$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T-TiO$_2$
and $\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T-TiO$_2$, both of which are energetically
more favourable than commonly adopted 1H and 1T phases. Here structural
distortions are characterized by the out-of-plane shifts of Ti atoms due to the
pseudo-Jahn-Teller interactions, which break one and all two inversion
symmetries of 1T configuration. As a consequence, the 1$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T
remains centrosymmetric while the $\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T exhibits
out-of-plane ferroelectricity. Electronic structure calculations show that both
two are wide-bandgap semiconductors with bandgaps larger than their bulk
counterparts. Our study not only deepens the understanding of structural
instability in wide-gap semiconductors but also adds a new member to the rare
family of two-dimensional out-of-plane ferroelectrics.

<p>We report the results of dc susceptibility and heat capacity measurements on
the (ball-milled) nanocrystalline rare-earth (R) ternary compound,
crystallizing in Gd4RhIn type, cubic Dy4RhAl compound. The bulk form of this
compound has been known to undergo antiferromagnetic ordering at (TN=) 18 K
with concomitant cluster spin glass anomalies. The present studies on the
nano-form obtained by ball milling reveal that this antiferromagnetic ordering
is suppressed with the reduction of particle size with no feature attributable
to a well defined long-range magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K, but showing an
inhomogeneous magnetism below 10 K. The point being stressed is that the
results show the dominance of a feature around 30 K in the magnetic
susceptibility data (well above TN of the bulk form) mimicking Griffiths phase.
We infer that surface magnetism dominates before long range magnetic ordering
occurs in this material.

<h3>Queues with resetting: a perspective</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Reshmi Roy, Arup Biswas, Arnab Pal</i>
<p>Performance modeling is a key issue in queuing theory and operation research.
It is well-known that the length of a queue that awaits service or the time
spent by a job in a queue depends not only on the service rate, but also
crucially on the fluctuations in service time. The larger the fluctuations, the
longer the delay becomes and hence, this is a major hindrance for the queue to
operate efficiently. Various strategies have been adapted to prevent this
drawback. In this perspective, we investigate the effects of one such novel
strategy namely resetting or restart, an emerging concept in statistical
physics and stochastic complex process, that was recently introduced to
mitigate fluctuations-induced delays in queues. In particular, we show that a
service resetting mechanism accompanied with an overhead time can remarkably
shorten the average queue lengths and waiting times. We examine various
resetting strategies and further shed light on the intricate role of the
overhead times to the queuing performance. Our analysis opens up future avenues
in operation research where resetting-based strategies can be universally
promising.

<p>Superconducting diode effects (SDEs) occur in systems with asymmetric
critical supercurrents $|I^c_+|\neq |I^c_-|$ yielding dissipationless flow in
one direction $(e.g., +)$, while dissipative transport in the opposite
direction $(-)$. Here we investigate the SDE in a phase-biased $\phi$ Josephson
junction with a double-barrier resonant-tunneling InAs nanowire nested between
proximitized InAs/Al leads with finite momentum $\hbar q$ Cooper pairing.
Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) approach, we obtain the exact BCS ground
state energy $\mathcal{E}_G(q,\phi)$ and $I^{c}_{+} \neq |I^{c}_{-}|$ from the
current-phase relation $I_G(q,\phi) \sim \partial_{\phi}\mathcal{E}_G(q,\phi)$.
The SDE arises from the accrued Andreev phase shifts $\delta
\phi_{L,R}(q,\phi)$ leading to asymmetric BdG spectra for $q\neq 0$.
Remarkably, the diode efficiency $\gamma=(I^{c}_{+} - |I^{c}_{-}|)/(I^{c}_{+} +
|I^{c}_{-}|)$ shows multiple Fabry-Perot resonances $\gamma \simeq 26\%$ at the
double-barrier Andreev bound states as the well depth $V_g$ is varied. Our
$\gamma$ also features sign reversals for increasing $q$ and high sensitiveness
to fermion-parity transitions. The latter enables $I^{c}_{+}
(\phi_+)\rightleftarrows I^{c}_{-}(\phi_-)$ switchings over narrow phase
windows, i.e., $\phi_+, \phi_- \in \Delta \phi\ll\pi$, possibly relevant for
future superconducting electronics.

<p>Engineering valley index is essential and highly sought for valley physics,
but currently it is exclusively based on the paradigm of the challenging
ferrovalley with spin-orientation reversal under magnetic field. Here, an
alternative strategy, i.e., the so-called ferroelectrovalley, is proposed to
tackle the insurmountable spin-orientation reversal, which reveres valley index
with the feasible ferroelectricity. Using symmetry arguments and tight-binding
model, the C_2 rotation is unveiled to be able to take the place of time
reversal for operating valley index in two-dimensional multiferroic kagome
lattices, which enables the ferroelectricity-engineered valley index, thereby
generating the concept of ferroelectrovalley. Based on first-principles
calculations, this concept is further demonstrated in the breathing kagome
lattice of single-layer Ti3Br8, wherein ferroelectricity couples the breathing
process. These findings open a new direction for valleytronics and
two-dimensional materials research.

<h3>A water structure indicator suitable for generic contexts: two-liquid  behavior at hydration and nanoconfinement conditions and a molecular approach  to hydrophobicity and wetting</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08992" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08992</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nicolás A. Loubet, Alejandro R. Verde, Gustavo A. Appignanesi</i>
<p>In a recent work we have briefly introduced a new structural index for water
that, unlike previous indicators, was devised specifically for generic contexts
beyond bulk conditions, making it suitable for hydration and nanoconfinement
settings. In this work we shall study this metric in detail, demonstrating its
ability to reveal the existence of a fine-tuned interplay between local
structure and energetics in liquid water. This molecular principle enables the
establishment of an extended hydrogen bond network, while simultaneously
allowing for the existence of network defects by compensating for uncoordinated
sites. By studying different water models and different temperatures
encompassing both the normal liquid and the supercooled regime, this molecular
mechanism will be shown to underlie the two-state behavior of bulk water.
Additionally, by studying functionalized self-assembled monolayers and diverse
graphene-like surfaces, we shall show that this principle is also operative at
hydration and nanoconfinement conditions, thus generalizing the validity of the
two-liquids scenario of water to these contexts. This approach will allow us to
define conditions for wettability, providing an accurate measure of
hydrophobicity and a reliable predictor of filling and drying transitions.
Hence, it might open the possibility of elucidating the active role of water in
broad fields of biophysics and materials science. As a preliminary step, we
shall study the hydration structure and hydrophilicity of graphene-like systems
(parallel graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes) as a function of the
confinement dimensionality. FOR A PROGRAMMING CODE TO IMPLEMENT V4s, PLEASE GO

<h3>Combinatorial Printing of Functionally Graded Solid-State Electrolyte  for High-Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</h3>

<p>Heterogeneous multilayered solid-state electrolyte (HMSSE) has been widely
explored for their broadened working voltage range and compatibility with
electrodes. However, due to the limitations of traditional manufacturing
methods such as casting, the interface between electrolyte layers in HMSSE can
decrease the ionic conductivity severely. Here, a novel combinatory aerosol jet
printing (CAJP) is introduced to fabricate functionally graded solid-state
electrolyte (FGSSE) without sharp interface. Owing to the unique ability of
CAJP (in-situ mixing and instantaneous tuning of the mixing ratio), FGSSE with
smooth microscale compositional gradation is achieved. Electrochemical tests
show that FGSSE has excellent oxidative stability exceeding 5.5 V and improved
conductivity (>7 times of an analogous HMSSE). By decoupling the total
resistance, we show that the resistance from the electrolyte/electrolyte
interface of HMSSE is 5.7 times of the total resistance of FGSSE. The
Li/FGSSE/NCM622 cell can be stably run for more than 200 cycles along with
improved rate performance.

<h3>Influence of Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot  carrier dynamics in InGaAs nanowires</h3>

<p>Understanding the origin of hot carrier relaxation in nanowires (NWs) with
one-dimensional (1D) geometry is significant for designing efficient hot
carrier solar cells with such nanostructures. Here, we study the influence of
Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot carrier dynamics of
catalyst-free InGaAs-InAlAs core-shell NWs. Using steady-state and
time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy the dependencies of hot
carrier effects on the degree of confinement of photo-generated carriers
induced by the nanowire diameter are determined at different lattice
temperatures. Analysis of excitation-power dependent data and
temperature-dependent PL linewidth broadening reveal that at low temperatures,
strong Auger recombination and phonon-bottleneck are responsible for hot
carrier effects. Our analysis gives also insights into electron-phonon and
ionized impurity scattering, showing opposing trends with NW diameter, and it
allows to estimate the Fr\"ohlich coupling constant for the InGaAs NWs.
Conversely, with increasing lattice temperature, hot carrier relaxation rates
increase due to enhanced Shockley-Read Hall and surface recombination.
Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a fourfold increase in the rate of
Shockley-Read-Hall recombination from 6 ns at 10 K to 1.5 ns at 150 K. The
findings suggest that minimizing defect densities in the bulk and surfaces of
these NWs will be key to enhance hot carrier effects towards higher
temperatures.

<h3>Solution-Processed Inks with Fillers of NbS$_3$ Quasi-One-Dimensional  Charge-Density-Wave Material</h3>

<p>We report on the solution processing and testing of electronic ink comprised
of quasi-one-dimensional NbS$_3$ charge-density-wave fillers. The ink was
prepared by liquid-phase exfoliation of NbS$_3$ crystals into high-aspect ratio
quasi-1D fillers dispersed in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and ethylene
glycol solution. The results of the electrical measurements of two-terminal
electronic test structures printed on silicon substrates reveal resistance
anomalies in the temperature range of ~330 K to 370 K. It was found that the
changes in the temperature-dependent resistive characteristics of the test
structures originate from the charge-density-wave phase transition of
individual NbS$_3$ fillers. The latter confirms that the exfoliated NbS$_3$
fillers preserve their intrinsic charge-density-wave quantum condensate states
and can undergo phase transitions above room temperature even after chemical
exfoliation processes and printing. These results are important for developing
"quantum inks" with charge-density-wave fillers for the increased functionality
of future solution-processed electronics.

</p><i>Stefan Grisard, Artur V. Trifonov, Thilo Hahn, Tilmann Kuhn, Oleh Hordiichuk, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Manfred Bayer, Ilya A. Akimov</i>
<p>We investigate the two-pulse photon echo response of excitons in the mixed
lead halide perovskite crystal \sample in dependence on the excitation
intensity and polarization of the incident laser pulses. Using spectrally
narrow picosecond laser pulses, we address localized excitons with long
coherence times $T_2 \approx 100\,$ps. This approach offers high sensitivity
for the observation of excitation-induced changes in the homogeneous linewidth
$\Gamma_2=2\hbar/T_2$ on the $\mu$eV scale. Through intensity-dependent
measurements, we evaluate the increase of $\Gamma_2$ by 10~$\mu$eV at an
exciton density of 10$^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$ being comparable with the intrinsic
linewidth of 14$\,\mu$eV. We observe that the decay of the photon echo and its
power dependence are sensitive to the polarization configuration of the
excitation pulses, which indicates that spin-dependent exciton-exciton
interactions contribute to excitation-induced dephasing. In cross-linear
polarization, the decay is faster and its dependence on exciton density is
stronger as compared to the co-polarized configuration. Using a two-exciton
model accounting for different spin configurations we are able to reproduce the
experimental results.

<h3>The Cellular Potts Model on Disordered Lattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09055" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09055</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hossein Nemati, Joost de Graaf</i>
<p>The Cellular Potts model, also known as Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model, is a
lattice-based approach, by which biological tissues at the level of individual
cells can be numerically studied. Traditionally, a square or hexagonal
underlying lattice structure is assumed for two-dimensional systems and this is
known to introduce artifacts in the structure and dynamics of the model
tissues. Here, we developed a new variant of this method that can be applied to
a broad class of (ir)regular lattices. We show that on an irregular lattice,
deriving from a fluid-like configuration, two types of artifacts can be
removed. We further report on the transition between a fluid-like disordered
and a solid-like hexagonally ordered phase present for monodisperse confluent
cells as a function of their surface tension. This transition shows the
hallmarks of a first-order phase transition, and is different from the
glass/jamming transitions commonly reported for the vertex and Voronoi models.
We emphasize this by analyzing the distribution of shape parameters found in
our state space. Our analysis provides a useful reference for the future study
of epithelia using the (ir)regular Cellular Potts model.

<h3>Time-resolved quantum correlations in electronic noise</h3>

</p><i>Jean-Olivier Simoneau, Sébastien Jezouin, Christian Lupien, Bertrand Reulet</i>
<p>The statistics of quantum transport in nanostructures can be tailored by a
time-dependent bias voltage $V(t)$. We demonstrate experimentally how
correlations of current fluctuations at two different times $t$ and $t+\tau$
depend on the shape of $V(t)$ via the phase accumulated by the electronic
wavefunctions between $t$ and $t+\tau$. For this we measure the current-current
correlation of the shot noise of an ac+dc biased tunnel junction using a 10 GHz
bandwidth, time-resolved detection. Our result allows to explore correlations
within a single excitation period. It demonstrates the counterpart of the ac
Josephson effect in superconducting junctions, to a normal, non-superconducting
mesoscopic device.

<p>Anderson localization is anticipated to play a pivotal role in the
manifestation of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, akin to its role in
conventional quantum Hall effects. The significance of Anderson localization is
particularly pronounced in elucidating the reasons behind the fragility of the
observed quantum anomalous Hall state in the intrinsic magnetic topological
insulator MnBi2Te4 with a large predicted magnetic gap. Here, employing varying
sized MnBi2Te4 micro/nano-structures fabricated from a single
molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown thin film, we have carried out a systematic size-
and temperature-dependent study on the transport properties of the films
regarding the quantum anomalous Hall states. The low-temperature transport
properties of the finite-sized MnBi2Te4 samples can be quantitatively
understood through Anderson localization, which plays an indispensable role in
stabilizing the ground states. At higher temperatures, the failure of electron
localization induced by an excessively short electronic dephasing length is
identified as the cause of deviation from quantization. The work reveals that
electronic dephasing and localization are non-negligible factors in designing
high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall systems.

<p>Subjecting a massive two-dimensional Dirac material to a vortex light beam
provides a mechanism for the photo-induction of multiply quantized vortices.
Using Floquet theory, we show that electronic vortices, characterized by their
total angular momentum, are exclusive to circularly polarized vortex beams. The
equations for the driven system at the one photon-resonance are mapped to the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations of $s$-wave superconductors with multiply
quantized vortices. This mapping provides valuable analytical tools for the
analysis of the system's spectral properties.

</p><i>Chao Duan, Nikhil R. Agrawal, Rui Wang</i>
<p>Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with
spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great
challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates
electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers.
Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations
induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by
reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the
repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction
induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship
between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface
electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger
microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in
the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in
good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.

<h3>Coherently controlling robust spin-orbit qubits of electrons in nanowire  quantum dots</h3>

</p><i>Kuo Hai, Xuefang Deng, Qiong Chen, Wenhua Hai</i>
<p>We consider an electron confined in a gated nanowire quantum dot (NQD) with
arbitrarily strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and weak static magnetic field,
and treat the latter as a perturbation to seek the maximal spin-motion
entangled states with the exact general solutions of the perturbed equations.
From the boundedness and self-consistent conditions of the general solutions we
find two corrected energies to any n level of the unperturbed system with
ground state n = 0, which are much less than the unperturbed level-difference
and corresponds to a spin-orbit qubit. We demonstrate the metastability of the
two-level states and the decoherence-averse effect of SOC, and suggest an
alternative scheme to perform the qubit control, simply by adjusting the
orientation of magnetic field for any fixed SOC. Such a adjustment can lead to
the spin flipping of the state vector and the position exchanging of the
probability-density wavepackets which can be proposed as the non-Abelian
quasiparticles. The results could be directly extended to a weakly coupled
array of NQDs for coherently encoding the robust spin-orbit qubits.

<p>Overheating has emerged as a primary challenge constraining the reliability
and performance of next-generation high-performance electronics, such as
chiplets and (ultra)wide bandgap electronics. Advanced heterogeneous
integration not only constitutes a pivotal technique for fabricating these
electronics but also offers potential solutions for thermal management. This
study presents the integration of high thermal conductivity semiconductors,
specifically, 3C-SiC thin films and diamond substrates, through a
room-temperature surface-activated bonding technique. Notably, the thermal
conductivity of the 3C-SiC films is among the highest for all semiconductor
films which can be integrated near room temperature with similar thicknesses.
Furthermore, following annealing, the interfaces between 3C-SiC and diamond
demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in thermal boundary conductance (TBC),
reaching up to approximately 300%, surpassing all other grown and bonded
heterointerfaces. This enhancement is attributed to interfacial reactions,
specifically the transformation of amorphous silicon into SiC upon interaction
with diamond, which is further corroborated by picosecond ultrasonics
measurements. Subsequent to annealing at 1100 C, the achieved TBC (150 MW/m2-K)
is record-high among all bonded diamond interfaces. Additionally, the
visualization of large-area TBC, facilitated by femtosecond laser-based
time-domain thermoreflectance measurements, shows the uniformity of the
interfaces which are capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 1100 C.
Our research marks a significant advancement in the realm of thermally
conductive heterogeneous integration, which is promising for enhanced cooling
of next-generation electronics.

</p><i>Lina Yang, Yixin Xu, Xianheng Wang, Yanguang Zhou</i>
<p>Tuning thermal transport in nanostructures is essential for many
applications, such as thermal management and thermoelectrics. Nanophononic
metamaterials (NPM) have shown great potential for reducing thermal
conductivity by introducing local resonant hybridization. In this work, the
thermal conductivity of NPM with crystalline Si (c-Si) pillar, crystalline Ge
(c-Ge) pillar and amorphous Si (a-Si) pillar are systematically investigated by
molecular dynamics method. The analyses of phonon dispersion and spectral
energy density show that phonon dispersions of Si membrane are flattened due to
local resonant hybridization induced by both crystalline and amorphous pillar.
In addition, a-Si pillar can cause larger reduction of thermal conductivity
compared with c-Si pillar. Specifically, when increasing the atomic mass of
atoms in pillars, the thermal conductivity of NPMs with crystalline pillar is
increased because of the weakened phonon hybridization, however, the thermal
conductivity of NPMs with amorphous pillar is almost unchanged, which indicates
that the phonon transports are mainly affected by the scatterings at the
interface between amorphous pillar and Si membrane. The results of this work
can provide meaningful insights on controlling thermal transport in NPMs by
choosing the materials and atomic mass of pillars for specific applications.

the inner and outer conducting layers of

<p>Coexisting orders are key features of strongly correlated materials and
underlie many intriguing phenomena from unconventional superconductivity to
topological orders. Here, we report the coexistence of two interacting
charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in EuTe4, a layered crystal that has drawn
considerable attention owing to its anomalous thermal hysteresis and a
semiconducting CDW state despite the absence of perfect FS nesting. By
accessing unoccupied conduction bands with time- and angle-resolved
photoemission measurements, we find that mono- and bi-layers of Te in the unit
cell host different CDWs that are associated with distinct energy gaps. The two
gaps display dichotomous evolutions following photoexcitation, where the larger
bilayer CDW gap exhibits less renormalization and faster recovery.
Surprisingly, the CDW in the Te monolayer displays an additional
momentum-dependent gap renormalization that cannot be captured by
density-functional theory calculations. This phenomenon is attributed to
interlayer interactions between the two CDW orders, which account for the
semiconducting nature of the equilibrium state. Our findings not only offer
microscopic insights into the correlated ground state of EuTe4 but also provide
a general non-equilibrium approach to understand coexisting, layer-dependent
orders in a complex system.

<p>Near-infrared (NIR) pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy is used to
investigate the charge and spin exciations in a strongly correlated electron
compound Na0.5CoO2. This compound exhibits a coexistence of various charge and

degrees of freedom. NIR pulses create significantly diverse effects on the
charge and spin orders; while the charge order is easily melted,coherent magnon
excitations are present in all fluences examined. Furthermore, a novel {\pi}
phase shift of the coherent magnon oscillations is observed in the pump-induced
change of the terahertz electric field between regions of increasing and
decreasing field change. These results unequivocally illustrate that ultrashort
laser pulses enable the disentanglement of different interactions within
complex systems characterized by multiple orders, providing a fresh perspective
on the interplay between itinerant and localized electrons within the Co 3d t2g

<h3>Scaling and Finite-Size Scaling above the Upper Critical Dimension</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ralph Kenna, Bertrand Berche</i>
<p>In the 1960's, four famous scaling relations were developed which relate the
six standard critical exponents describing continuous phase transitions in the
thermodynamic limit of statistical physics models. They are well understood at
a fundamental level through the renormalization group. They have been verified
in multitudes of theoretical, computational and experimental studies and are
firmly established and profoundly important for our understanding of critical
phenomena. One of the scaling relations, hyperscaling, fails above the upper
critical dimension. There, critical phenomena are governed by Gaussian fixed
points in the renormalization-group formalism. Dangerous irrelevant variables
are required to deliver the mean-field and Landau values of the critical
exponents, which are deemed valid by the Ginzburg criterion. Also above the
upper critical dimension, the standard picture is that, unlike for
low-dimensional systems, finite-size scaling is non-universal. Here we report
on new developments which indicate that the current paradigm is flawed and
incomplete. In particular, the introduction of a new exponent characterising
the finite-size correlation length allows one to extend hyperscaling beyond the
upper critical dimension. Moreover, finite-size scaling is shown to be
universal provided the correct scaling window is chosen. These recent
developments also lead to the introduction of a new scaling relation analogous
to one introduced by Fisher 50 years ago.

<p>Scaling, hyperscaling and finite-size scaling were long considered
problematic in theories of critical phenomena in high dimensions. The scaling
relations themselves form a model-independent structure that any model-specific
theory must adhere to, and they are accounted for by the simple principle of
homogeneity. Finite-size scaling is similarly founded on the fundamental idea
that only two length scales enter the game -- namely system length and
correlation length. While all scaling relations are quite satisfactory for
multitudes of physical systems in low dimensions, one fails in high
dimensions...

<p>Among known materials, hydride superconductors have the highest critical
temperatures and are very promising as a basis for electronic sensors.
Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), due to its unique
sensitivity to magnetic fields, is the most important application of
superconductors in microelectronics. In this work, we describe a direct current
SQUID made of lanthanum-cerium superhydride (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ at a pressure of
148 GPa, with an operating temperature of 179 K and a bias current of about 2
mA. When placing (La, Ce)H$_{10}$ in a modulated magnetic field (0.1-0.005 Hz,
5 G), we observed the generation of higher harmonics up to 18${\nu}$$_0$ and a
periodic dependence of the sample resistance on the magnetic flux density R
${\propto}$ cos(${\pi}$${\Phi}$/${\Phi}$$_0$). We demonstrate that the (La,

<h3>Anomalous magnetoentropic response of skrymion crystals</h3>

</p><i>Ahmed R. Saikia, Narayan Mohanta</i>
<p>We investigate theoretically magnetoentropic signatures of the crystal phase
of magnetic skyrmions of various kinds, commonly appearing in two dimensions,
\textit{viz.}, N\'eel, Bloch and anti skyrmions. Using Monte Carlo calculations
based on spin Hamiltonians, we obtain magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_m$ in
the presence of three different types of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
responsible for these skyrmions. The phase mapping of $\Delta S_m$ using
skyrmion counting number $N_{sk}$ in temperature-magnetic field plane reveals
fluctuation-dominated weak first-order transition in the precursor phase of the
skyrmions, and a sign change in $\Delta S_m$ when the system enters into the
skyrmion crystal phase -- in agreement with recent experimental findings. We
also find that the fractional entropy change in going from a ferromagnetic
phase to the skyrmion crystal phase is much larger compared to the conventional
route of paramagnetic phase to ferromagnetic phase, used for the purpose of
magnetic cooling. The magnetoentropic signatures of the different types of
skyrmion crystals are found to be similar. Our results indicate that the
skyrmion crystals exhibit enhanced cooling efficiency and have the potential to
upgrade the existing magnetic cooling methods.

<h3>Flat Band Josephson Junctions with Quantum Metric</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09211</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zhong C.F. Li, Yuxuan Deng, Shuai A. Chen, Dmitri K. Efetov, K. T. Law</i>
<p>In this work, we consider superconductor/flat band material/superconductor
(S/FB/S) Josephson junctions (JJs) where the flat band material possesses
isolated flat bands with exactly zero Fermi velocity. Contrary to conventional
S/N/S JJs in which the critical Josephson current vanishes when the Fermi
velocity goes to zero, we show here that the critical current in the S/FB/S
junction is controlled by the quantum metric length $\xi_{QM}$ of the flat
bands. Microscopically, when $\xi_{QM}$ of the flat band is long enough, the
interface bound states originally localized at the two S/FB, FB/S interfaces
can penetrate deeply into the flat band material and hybridize to form Andreev
bound states (ABS). These ABS are able to carry long range and sizable
supercurrents. Importantly, $\xi_{QM}$ also controls how far the proximity
effect can penetrate into the flat band material. This is in sharp contrast
with de Gennes' theory for S/N junctions in which the proximity effect is
expected to be zero when the Fermi velocity of the normal metal is zero. We
further suggest that the S/FB/S junctions gives rise to a new type of resonant
Josephson transistors which can carry sizeable and highly gate-tunable
supercurrent.

<h3>Physics-informed tracking of qubit fluctuations</h3>

<p>Environmental fluctuations degrade the performance of solid-state qubits but
can in principle be mitigated by real-time Hamiltonian estimation down to time
scales set by the estimation efficiency. We implement a physics-informed and an
adaptive Bayesian estimation strategy and apply them in real time to a
semiconductor spin qubit. The physics-informed strategy propagates a
probability distribution inside the quantum controller according to the
Fokker-Planck equation, appropriate for describing the effects of nuclear spin
diffusion in gallium-arsenide. Evaluating and narrowing the anticipated
distribution by a predetermined qubit probe sequence enables improved dynamical
tracking of the uncontrolled magnetic field gradient within the singlet-triplet
qubit. The adaptive strategy replaces the probe sequence by a small number of
qubit probe cycles, with each probe time conditioned on the previous
measurement outcomes, thereby further increasing the estimation efficiency. The
combined real-time estimation strategy efficiently tracks low-frequency nuclear
spin fluctuations in solid-state qubits, and can be applied to other qubit
platforms by tailoring the appropriate update equation to capture their
distinct noise sources.

<h3>Eigenvalue Preferential Attachment Networks A Dandelion Structure</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09238</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vadood Adami, Zahra Ebadi, Morteza Nattagh-Najafi</i>
<p>In this paper we introduce a new type of preferential attachment network, the
growth of which is based on the eigenvalue centrality. In this network, the
agents attach most probably to the nodes with larger eigenvalue centrality
which represents that the agent has stronger connections. A new network is
presented, namely a dandelion network, which shares some properties of
star-like structure and also a hierarchical network. We show that this network,
having hub-and-spoke topology is not generally scale free, and shows essential
differences with respect to the Barab{\'a}si-Albert preferential attachment
model. Most importantly, there is a super hub agent in the system (identified
by a pronounced peak in the spectrum), and the other agents are classified in
terms of the distance to this super-hub. We explore a plenty of statistical
centralities like the nodes degree, the betweenness and the eigenvalue
centrality, along with various measures of structure like the community and
hierarchical structures, and the clustering coefficient. Global measures like
the shortest path statistics and the self-similarity are also examined.

<p>The identification of tipping points is essential for prediction of collapses
or other sudden changes in complex systems. Applications include studies of
ecology, thermodynamics, climatology, and epidemiology. However, detecting
early signs of proximity to a tipping is made challenging by complexity and
non-linearity. Strongly interacting Rydberg atom gases offer a model systems
that offer both complexity and non-linearity, including phase transition and
critical slowing down. Here, via an external probe we observe prior warning of
the proximity of a phase transition of Rydberg thermal gases. This warning
signal is manifested as a cessation of the variance growth with increasing
probe intensity. We also observed the dynamics of the critical slowing down
behavior versus different time scales, driving intensities, and atomic
densities, thus providing insights into the study of a Rydberg atom system's
critical behavior. Our experiment suggests that the full critical slowing down
dynamics of strongly-interacting Rydberg atoms can be probed systematically,
thus providing a benchmark with which to identify critical phenomena in quantum
many-body systems.

<h3>Quantized polarization in a generalized Rice-Mele model at arbitrary  filling</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09262</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yasuhiro Tada</i>
<p>We discuss the charge polarization in a generalized Rice-Mele model at
arbitrary particle filling per site as a model of charge ordered systems in one
dimension. The model possesses neither the conventional bond-centered inversion
symmetry nor the one site translation symmetry alone, but has combinations of
these symmetries. We show that the charge polarization in the ground state is
quantized by the combined symmetry and is characterized solely by the filling.
Especially, the polarization can be $1/2$ (mod 1) in the zero filling limit.
Under the open boundary condition, there exist excess charges accumulated near
edges of the system irrespective of existence or absence of edge modes.
Correspondingly, we decompose the polarization into a bulk contribution and an
edge contribution, and numerically demonstrate that the polarization is
dominated by the former (latter) when the energy gap is large (small). We also
discuss a simple generalization of our model and examine absence/existence of a
gapless edge mode protected by the inversion symmetry by introducing intra unit
cell and inter unit cell contributions of the charge polarization.

</p><i>Min Deng, Ming Xue, Jinghan Pang, Hui Luo, Zhiguo Wang, Jinbin Li, Dayou Yang</i>
<p>We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a binary mixture of
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with competing interspecies $s$- and $p$-wave
interactions. Exploiting a pseudopotential model for the $l=1$ partial wave, we
derive an extended Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation for the BEC mixture that
incorporates both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions. Based on it, we study the
miscible-immiscible transition of a binary BEC mixture in the presence of
interspecies $p$-wave interaction, by combining numerical solution of the GP
equation and Gaussian variational analysis. Our study uncovers a dual effect --
either enhance or reduce miscibility -- of positive interspecies $p$-wave
interaction, which can be precisely controlled by adjusting relevant
experimental parameters. By complete characterizing the miscibility phase
diagram, we establish a promising avenue towards experimental control of the
miscibility of binary BEC mixtures via high partial-wave interactions.

<h3>Exclusive-or encoded algebraic structure for efficient quantum dynamics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Lukas Broers, Ludwig Mathey</i>
<p>We propose a formalism that captures the algebraic structure of many-body
two-level quantum systems, and directly motivates an efficient numerical
method. This formalism is based on the binary representation of the
enumeration-indices of the elements of the corresponding Lie algebra. The
action of arbitrarily large elements of that algebra reduces to a few bit-wise
exclusive-or operations. This formalism naturally produces sparse
representations of many-body density operators, the size of which we control
through a dynamic truncation method. We demonstrate how this formalism applies
to real-time evolution, dissipative Lindblad action, imaginary-time evolution,
and projective measurement processes. We find that this approach to calculating
quantum dynamics scales close to linearly with the number of non-zero
components in the density operator. We refer to this exclusive-or represented
quantum algebra as ORQA. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical
demonstration of this formalism by simulating quantum annealing processes for
the maximum independent set problem for up to 22 two-level systems.

<h3>Exceptionally High Two-Photon Absorption in Diazaacene-Bithiophene  Derivatives: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Approach</h3>

<p>This study delves into the enhancement of two-photon absorption (2PA)
properties in diazaacene-bithiophene derivatives through a synergistic approach
combining theoretical analysis and experimental validation. By investigating
the structural modifications and their impact on 2PA cross sections, we
identify key factors that significantly influence the 2PA efficiency. For all
molecular systems studied, our state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations
show a very high involvement of the first excited singlet state (S1) in the 2PA
processes into higher excited states, even if this state itself has only a
small 2PA cross section for symmetry reasons. Consequently, both the oscillator
strength of S1 and the transition dipole moments between S1 and other excited
states are of importance, underscoring the role of electronic polarizability in
facilitating effective two-photon interactions. The investigated compounds
exhibit large 2PA cross sections over a wide near-infrared spectral range
reaching giant values of 42000 GM. The introduction of diazine and diazaacene
moieties into bithiophene derivatives not only induces charge transfer but also
opens up pathways for the creation of materials with tailored nonlinear optical
responses, suggesting potential applications in nonlinear optics.

<h3>A universal strategy for decoupling stiffness and extensibility polymer  networks</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Baiqiang Huang, Shifeng Nian, Li-Heng Cai</i>
<p>Since the invention of polymer networks in the 19th century (e.g.,
crosslinked natural rubber by Goodyear), it has been a dogma that stiffer
networks are less stretchable, a trade-off inherent to the molecular nature of
polymer network strands. Here, we report a universal strategy for decoupling
the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using
linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which
feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon
elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling
remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely
proportional to the network strand mass and is determined by the side chains.
We validate this concept by creating a series of unentangled single-network
elastomers with nearly constant Young's modulus (30 kPa) while increasing
tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20% to 800%. We show that this
strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies. Our
discovery opens an avenue for developing polymer networks with extraordinary
mechanical properties.

<h3>Nitrogen-monovacancy (VN) Hexagonal Boron Nitride 2D Monolayer Material  as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction Reaction</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09340" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09340</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lokesh Yadav, Srimanta Pakhira</i>
<p>The conversion of waste carbon dioxide (CO2) gas into valuable products and
fuels through an electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising
approach. The sluggish kinetics of the CO2RR require the development of novel
strategies for electrocatalyst design. Two-dimensional (2D) materials emerge as
promising candidates for CO2RR due to their distinctive electronic and
structural properties. This study follows the first principles based DFT-D
method to examine the electrocatalytic competences of the defective
two-dimensional boron nitride monolayer (d-BN) material towards CO2RR.
Introducing a particular defect with nitrogen vacancies in the 2D single layer
pristine hexagonal boron nitride (VN_d-BN) can efficiently activate the CO2
molecules for hydrogenation by reducing the electronic band gap of the pristine
hBN from 6.23 eV to 3.0 eV. Therefore, VN_d-BN material can act as a large band
gap semiconductor. Our findings demonstrate that the defective regions in the
2D monolayer VN_d-BN serve as active sites (Boron) for both the adsorption and
activation of CO2. The subsequent hydrogenation steps occur sequentially once
the CO2 molecule is adsorbed on the catalytic surface. Our results indicate
that the OCHO* path is the most favorable for CH4 production. Hence, the 2D
monolayer VN_d-BN material holds a great promise as a cost-effective catalyst
for CO2RR, and it presents a viable alternative to expensive platinum (Pt)
catalysts.

<p>There is considerable interest in designing new polymeric materials with

exploration of several polyethylene-based polymers that contain strategically
incorporated cleavable bonds that are susceptible to chemical degradation. We
consider ten distinct telechelic functionalities across varying chain lengths:
ester, aromatic ester, anhydride, carbonate, urethane, siloxane, oxalate,
acetal, urea, and amide linkages. Our study is focused on the effects of
cleavable bonds on density, diffusion, enthalpy, and melting temperatures. We
also examine the crystallization process. These are key properties for polymer
processing and, by comparing them to those of linear polyethylene, we establish
a platform that will help guide future synthetic efforts towards the design of
sustainable plastics with performance comparable to that of traditional,
high-performance polyolefin-based materials.

<h3>Blue quantum emitter in hexagonal boron nitride and carbon chain  tetramer: proposition of identification</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Marek Maciaszek, Lukas Razinkovas</i>
<p>Single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride offer a gateway to the
future of quantum technologies, yet their identification remains challenging
and subject to ongoing debate. We demonstrate through ab initio calculations
that the optical properties of a carbon chain tetramer are in excellent
agreement with the characteristics of a blue quantum emitter in hexagonal boron
nitride emitting at 435 nm. Its calculated zero-phonon line energy (2.77 eV)
and radiative lifetime (1.6 ns) perfectly align with experimental observations.
The relatively weak electron--phonon coupling (Huang-Rhys factor of 1.5)
indicates intense emission at the zero-phonon line. Despite the absence of an
inversion center in the carbon tetramer, we demonstrate that it exhibits a
negligible linear Stark effect, consistent with experimental findings.
Additionally, our hypothesis explains the experimental observation that the
formation of blue emitters is only possible in samples containing numerous
ultraviolet emitters, which are likely identical to carbon dimers.

<h3>Shape equilibria of vesicles with rigid planar inclusions</h3>

</p><i>Geunwoong Jeon, Justin Fagnoni, Hao Wan, Maria M. Santore, Gregory M. Grason</i>
<p>Motivated by recent studies of two-phase lipid vesicles possessing 2D solid
domains integrated within a fluid bilayer phase, we study the shape equilibria
of closed vesicles possessing a single planar, circular inclusion. While 2D
solid elasticity tends to expel Gaussian curvature, topology requires closed
vesicles to maintain an average, non-zero Gaussian curvature leading to an
elementary mechanism of shape frustration that increases with inclusion size.
We study elastic ground states of the Helfrich model of the planar-fluid
composite vesicles, analytically and computationally, as a function of planar
fraction and reduced volume. Notably, we show that incorporation of a planar
inclusion of only a few percent dramatically shifts the ground state shapes of
vesicles from predominantly {\it prolate} to {\it oblate}, and moreover, shifts
the optimal surface to volume ratio far from spherical shapes. We show that for
sufficiently small planar inclusions, the elastic ground states break symmetry
via a complex variety of asymmetric oblate, prolate, and triaxial shapes, while
inclusion sizes above about $8\%$ drive composite vesicles to adopt
axisymmetric oblate shapes. These predictions cast useful light on the emergent
shape and mechanical responses of fluid-solid composite vesicles.

are investigated based on first-principles approach. The formation energy

<p>Using the tight-binding model, a multi-terminal superconductor(S) device is
proposed, where the structures of the center region are primitive grpahene(G)
and Y-shaped Kekul\'{e} graphene superlattice(GS), respectively. The
intravalley Andreev reflection is studied in this model through the utilization
of the non-equilibrium Green's function method. In the G/S device, due to the
time-reverse symmetry the dominant process of Andreev reflection is intervalley
reflection. In a three-terminal GS/S device, it has been observed that the
coefficient of intravalley Andreev reflection can surpass that of intervalley
reflection in crossed Andreev reflection. This is attributed to the coupling
between valleys K and -K within the first Brillouin zone, resulting in enhanced
intervalley scattering. The valley-dependent transport of Andreev reflection
can be influenced by the phase difference between superconductor terminals. The
valley polarization of the local Andreev reflection and the crossed Andreev
reflection could be controlled by adjusting the structure of the central
region.

<p>Solving quantum impurity problems may advance our understanding of strongly

been greatly hindered due to the presence of shared bath. Here, we propose a
general operation strategy to disentangle the shared bath into multiple
auxiliary baths and relate the problem to a spectral decomposition problem of
function matrix for applying the numerical renormalization group (NRG). We
prove exactly that such decomposition is possible for models satisfying (block)
circulant symmetry, and show how to construct the auxiliary baths for arbitrary
impurity configuration by mapping its graph structure to the subgraph of a
regular impurity configuration. We further propose an approximate decomposition
algorithm to reduce the number of auxiliary baths and save the computational
workload. Our work reveals a deep connection between quantum impurity problems
and the graph theory, and provides a general scheme to extend the NRG
applications for realistic multi-impurity systems.

<p>Magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) are a potential field for the energy storage
of the future but are restricted by insufficient rate capability and rapid
capacity degradation. Magnesium-sodium hybrid ion batteries (MSHBs) are an
effective way to address these problems. Here, we report a new type of MSHBs
that use layered sodium vanadate ((Na, Mn)V8O20 5H2O, Mn-NVO) cathodes coupled
with an organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode in
Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. During electrochemical cycling, Mg2+ and Na+
co-participate in the cathode reactions, and the introduction of Na+ promotes
the structural stability of the Mn-NVO cathode, as cleared by several ex-situ
characterizations. Consequently, the Mn-NVO cathode presents great specific
capacity (249.9 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1) and cycling (1500 cycles at 1500 mA g-1)
in the Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. Besides, full battery displays long

stability of MSHBs have been improved by an economical and scalable method, and
the mechanism for these improvements was discussed.

<p>Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles
exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been
theoretically established in the static regime. In this work we investigate the
formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave
spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that
the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$,
whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive
frequency and chemical potential. Then we explore the induced pair correlations
and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced,
acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that,
while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence
of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in
the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the
drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes
larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as
a function of frequency remains. Our work thus paves the way for understanding
the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors

<p>Quantum computers (QC) could harbor the potential to significantly advance

matter systems with currently available noisy quantum computers remains
elusive, quantum embedding schemes like dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
allow the mapping of an effective, reduced subspace Hamiltonian to available
devices to improve the accuracy of ab initio calculations such as density
functional theory (DFT). Here, we report on the development of a hybrid
quantum-classical DFT+DMFT simulation framework which relies on a quantum
impurity solver based on the Lehmann representation of the impurity Green's
function. Hardware experiments with up to 14 qubits on the IBM Quantum system
are conducted, using advanced error mitigation methods and a novel calibration
scheme for an improved zero-noise extrapolation to effectively reduce adverse
effects from inherent noise on current quantum devices. We showcase the utility
of our quantum DFT+DMFT workflow by assessing the correlation effects on the
electronic structure of a real material, Ca2CuO2Cl2, and by carefully
benchmarking our quantum results with respect to exact reference solutions and

<h3>Optical probing of the carriers-mediated coupling of the spin of two Co  atoms in a quantum dot</h3>

<br>
</p><i>L. Besombes, J. Kobak, W. Pacuski</i>
<p>We report on the optical spectroscopy of the spin of two Co atoms in a
quantum dot and interacting with a single exciton. The spectrum of quantum dots
containing two Co atoms are exchange interaction and by the strain at the
location of the magnetic atoms. A wide range of spectrum can be obtained
depending on the relative coupling of each atom to the confined exciton. We
obtained a comprehensive interpretation of the experimental data with a spin
Hamiltonian model. We show that the two Co atoms spins can be orientated by the
injection of spin polarized carriers at zero magnetic field. This induces a
correlation between the two spins that is observed in the intensity
distribution of the emission spectra. The optical absorption in the phonon
sideband of quantum dots doped with two Co reveals resonant absorptions which
strongly depend on a transverse magnetic field. We show that these
characteristic absorptions result from an interplay between the mixing of Co

<p>Epitaxial growth of WTe$_2$ offers significant advantages, including the
production of high-qualityfilms, possible long range in-plane ordering and
precise control over layer thicknesses. However,the mean island size of WTe$_2$
grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in litterature is only a fewtens of
nanometers, which is not suitable for an implementation of devices at large
lateral scales.Here we report the growth of Td-WTe$_2$ ultrathin films by MBE
on monolayer (ML) graphenereaching a mean flake size of $\cong$110nm, which is,
on overage, more than three time larger thanprevious results. WTe$_2$ films
thicker than 5nm have been successfully synthesized and exhibit theexpected
Td-phase atomic structure. We rationalize epitaxial growth of Td-WTe$_2$ and
propose asimple model to estimate the mean flake size as a function of growth
parameters that can be appliedto other transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs). Based on nucleation theory and Kolmogorov-Johnson-Meh-Avrami (KJMA)
equation, our analytical model supports experimental data showinga critical
coverage of 0.13ML above which WTe$_2$ nucleation becomes negligible. The
quality ofmonolayer WTe$_2$ films is demonstrated from electronic band
structure analysis using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in
agreement with first-principle calculationsperformed on free-standing WTe$_2$

<p>Interlayer magnetic interactions play a pivotal role in determining the
magnetic arrangement within van der Waals (vdW) magnets, and the remarkable
tunability of these interactions through applied pressure further enhances
their significance. Here, we investigate NiI2 flakes, a representative vdW
magnet, under hydrostatic pressures up to 11 GPa. We reveal a notable increase
in magnetic transition temperatures for both helimagnetic and antiferromagnetic
states, and find that a reversible transition from helimagnetic to
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases at approximately 7 GPa challenges established
theoretical and experimental expectations. While the increase in transition
temperature aligns with pressure-enhanced overall exchange interaction
strengths, we identify the significant role of the second-nearest neighbor
interlayer interaction, which competes with intra-layer frustration and favors
the AFM state as demonstrated in the Monte Carlo simulations. Experimental and
simulated results converge on the existence of an intermediate helimagnetic
ordered state in NiI2 before transitioning to the AFM state. These findings
underscore the pivotal role of interlayer interactions in shaping the magnetic
ground state, providing fresh perspectives for innovative applications in
nanoscale magnetic device design.

<h3>Dispersionless Flat Mode and Vibrational Anomaly in Active Brownian  Vibrators Induced by String-like Dynamical Defects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09583" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09583</a>
<br>
</p><i>Cunyuan Jiang, Zihan Zheng, Yangrui Chen, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang</i>
<p>In recent years, active Brownian particles have emerged as a prominent model
system for comprehending the behaviors of active matter, wherein particles
demonstrate self-propelled motion by harnessing energy from the surrounding
environment. A fundamental objective of studying active matter is to elucidate
the physical mechanisms underlying its collective behaviors. Drawing
inspiration from advancements in molecular glasses, our study unveils a
low-energy ``flat mode" within the transverse spectrum of active Brownian
vibrators -- a nearly two-dimensional, bi-disperse granular assembly. We
demonstrate that this collective excitation induces an anomalous excess in the
vibrational density of states (VDOS) beyond the phononic Debye contribution.
Additionally, we establish through empirical evidence that string-like
dynamical defects, discerned via the spatial distribution of each particle's
contribution to the reduced transverse VDOS, serve as the microscopic origin of
the flat mode and its associated anomalies. These findings underscore the
pivotal role of string-like dynamical defects in elucidating the vibrational
and mechanical properties of active Brownian particles.

<h3>Guidelines for accurate and efficient calculations of mobilities in  two-dimensional materials</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jiaqi Zhou, Samuel Poncé, Jean-Christophe Charlier</i>
<p>Emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials bring unprecedented opportunities for
electronic applications. The design of high-performance devices requires an
accurate prediction of carrier mobility in 2D materials, which can be obtained
using state-of-the-art $ab~initio$ calculations. However, various factors
impact the computational accuracy, leading to contradictory estimations for the
mobility. In this work, targeting accurate and efficient $ab~initio$
calculations, transport properties in III-V monolayers are reported using the
Boltzmann transport equation, and the influences of pseudopotential, quadrupole
correction, Berry connection, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on mobilities are
systematically investigated. Our findings are as follows: (1) The inclusion of
semi-core states in pseudopotentials is important to obtain accurate
calculations. (2) The variations induced by dynamical quadrupole and Berry
connection when treating long range fields can be respectively 40% and 10%. (3)
The impact of SOC can reach up to 100% for materials with multi-peak bands.
Importantly, although SOC notably modifies the electronic wavefunctions, it
negligibly impacts the dynamical matrices and scattering potential variations.
As a result, the combination of fully-relativistic electron calculation and
scalar-relativistic phonon calculation can strike a good balance between
accuracy and cost. This work compares computational methodologies, providing
guidelines for accurate and efficient calculations of mobilities in 2D
semiconductors.

equation, we demonstrate a Laplace transform method for precisely calculating
the temporal evolution of various dynamic moments. Our analysis yields explicit
expressions for multiple moments, such as the second and fourth moments of
displacement, revealing the impact of persistence and chirality. These moments
exhibit oscillatory behaviour, and excess kurtosis indicates deviations from
the Gaussian distribution during intermediate time intervals.

<p>We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity
with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves
from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of
$\pm\pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new
methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single
crystal of metals in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation
technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor
can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the
right- and left-handed circularly polarization modes. To verify the validity of
the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals
at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface
impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field
dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the
expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a
significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our
developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening
the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum materials, such
as time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductors.

essential for the design of reactors and for the development of polymer

<h3>On the chemical potential and grand potential density of solids under  non-hydrostatic stress</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09678</a>
<br>
</p><i>Michiel Sprik</i>
<p>Non-hydrostatic stress has a peculiar effect on the phase equilibrium between
solids and liquids. This was already pointed out by Gibbs. Gibbs derived his
formulation of the condition for liquid-solid coexistence applying a surface
accretion process without imposing chemical equilibrium between liquid and
solid. Adding particles to the bulk of a solid was not possible in his view at
the time. Chemical potentials for solids were later introduced by material
scientists. This required extending chemical and mechanical equilibrium with a
third condition involving a relation between grand potential densities
controlling the migration of the interface. These issues are investigated using
a non-linear elastic continuum model (technically an open compressible
neo-Hookean material) developed in a previous publication (M. Sprik, J. Chem.
Phys. 155, (2021) 244701). In common with a liquid, the grand potential density
of the model is equal to minus the mean pressure even if the stress is
non-hydrostatic. Applying isothermal compression normal to a liquid-solid
interface initially in hydrostatic equilibrium drives the system away from
coexistence. We derive the Gibbs-Thomson correction to the pressure of the
liquid required to restore phase equilibrium. We find that the coupling between
chemical potential of the solid and shear stress is a purely non-linear effect.

<p>Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire phenomenological approach we explore the
strain-polarization coupling in the low-dimensional van der Waals
ferrielectrics. We evolve the analytical model of the piezoelectric
susceptibility of the material in response to the periodic strain modulation,
such as caused by a surface acoustic wave. Numerical calculations are performed
for recently discovered and poorly studied ultrathin layers of the van der
Waals ferrielectric CuInP2S6, which are very promising candidates for advanced
nanoelectronics. We obtained that the temperature dependences of the dielectric
and piezoelectric susceptibilities, and elastic compliance of the ultrathin
CuInP2S6 layer have a sharp maximum at the temperature of CuInP2S6
paraelectric-ferrielectric phase transition near 320 K. The magnitudes of the
dielectric and piezoelectric susceptibilities, and elastic compliance depend
significantly on the modulation period of the surface acoustic wave. Obtained
results explore the potential of ultrathin CuInP2S6 layers for application in
piezoelectric and straintronic devices.

</p><i>Maria Kelidou, Mohammad Fazelzadeh, Baptiste Parage, Sara Jabbari Farouji</i>
<p>Self-propelled particles possessing permanent magnetic dipole moments occur
naturally in magnetotactic bacteria and in man-made systems like active
colloids or micro-robots. Yet, understanding the interplay between
self-propulsion and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions on dynamic
self-assembly in three dimensions (3D) remains poorly understood. We conduct
Brownian dynamics simulations on active dipolar particles in 3D, focusing on
the low-density regime, where dipolar hard spheres tend to form chain-like
aggregates and percolated networks with increasing dipolar coupling strength.
Strong active forces override dipolar attractions, effectively inhibiting
chain-like aggregation and network formation. Conversely, activating particles
with low to moderate forces yields an active fluid consisting of chains and
rings and an active gel with increasing dipolar coupling strength. Although the
overall structure of an active gel remains interconnected, the network
experiences more frequent configurational rearrangements due to the reduced
bond lifetime of active dipolar particles. Consequently, particles exhibit
enhanced translational and rotational diffusion within active fluid of strings
and active gels compared to their passive counterparts. We quantify the
influence of activity on aggregates topology, observing a transition from
branched structures to unconnected chains and rings. Our findings are
summarized in a state diagram, delineating the impact of dipolar coupling
strength and active force magnitude on the system.

<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSC) are promising potential competitors to
established photovoltaic technologies due to their superior efficiency and
low-cost solution processability. However, the limited understanding of the
crystallization behaviour hinders the technological transition from lab-scale
cells to modules. In this work, we perform Phase Field (PF) simulations of the
doctor-bladed film formation to obtain mechanistic and morphological
information that is experimentally challenging to access. PF simulations are
validated extensively using in- and ex-situ experiments for different solvent
evaporation rates. The well-known transition from a film with many pinholes,
for a low evaporation rate, to a smooth film, for high evaporation rates, is
recovered in simulation and experiment. From the simulation, the transition can
be assigned to the change in the ratio of evaporation to crystallization rate
because of two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, for larger evaporation rates,
nuclei appear at higher concentrations, which favors nucleation as compared to
growth. Secondly, the growth of the crystals is confined in a thinner film,
which limits their vertical size. Both effects are expected to be valid
independent of the specific chemistry of the chosen experimental system, as
long as the evaporation time of the solvent is comparable to the
crystallization time.

<p>Vector magnetometry is an essential tool in characterizing the distribution
of currents and magnetization in a broad range of systems. Point defect
sensors, like the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, have demonstrated
impressive sensitivity and spatial resolution for detecting these fields.
Measuring the vector field at a single point in space using single defects,
however, remains an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate that careful
optimization of the static bias field can enable simultaneous measurement of
multiple magnetic field components with enhanced sensitivity by leveraging the
nonlinear Zeeman shift from transverse magnetic fields. This work quantifies
the trade-off between the increased frequency shift from second-order Zeeman
effects with decreasing contrast as off-axis field components increase,
demonstrating the measurement of multiple components of the magnetic field from
an exemplar antiferromagnet with a complex magnetic texture.

</p><i>Samuel Poincloux, Kazumasa A. Takeuchi</i>
<p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological
assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How
significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response
of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in
soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental
system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances.
Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular
assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a
progressive rigidity transition, switching from a fluid-like to a solid-like
response by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging
fluid state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in
contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear
elastically. We rationalise this transition by uncovering an effective,
attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry
interplay. If friction is sufficiently high compared to shear, the extent of
the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry,
controls the rigidity transition.

<p>We have measured the critical current density, superconducting coherence
length, and superconducting transition temperature on single-domain,
epitaxially-grown Nb(110)/Au(111)/Nb(110) trilayers, all showing non-monotonic
behavior as a function of the thickness of the Au layer. To reveal the
underlying physical mechanism, we apply the first-principles-based microscopic
theory of inhomogeneous relativistic superconductivity which predicts
quantitatively the superconducting properties. As a result of the confinement
in the growth direction, quantum-well states appear in the Au layer which
yields a complex structure of Andreev states in the superconducting state. It
is shown how the quantum-well states modify the quasiparticle spectrum and the
Josephson supercurrent. Our study reveals the coexistence of the two
superconducting phases in the Au layer, the usual intraband s-wave phase and an
additional non-uniform phase stemming from interband pairing (without magnetic
field). These results indicate the rich interplay between quantum-size and
proximity effects, suggesting the possibility of modifying superconducting
transport properties by exploiting thickness-dependent quantum size effect

study four center Coulomb integrals for them. We reformulated these Coulomb

<p>Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently
observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic
trait involves scaling laws governing a second-order, gradual suppression of
the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The
localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting
breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here,
we show a departure from this paradigm, showcasing that amorphous
superconducting films of indium oxide undergo a distinctive, discontinuous
first-order quantum phase transition tuned by disorder. Through systematic
measurements of the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators,
we provide evidence for a marked jump of both the zero-temperature superfluid
stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This
discontinuous transition sheds light on the previously overlooked role of
repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition
between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, our
investigation shows that the critical temperature of the films no longer
relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness,
consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings
raise fundamental new questions into the role of disorder in quantum phase
transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits.

<p>Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) have emerged as a promising platform for the
realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. To obtain
robust quasi one-dimensional (1D) topological superconducting states using
planar JJs, limiting the number of 1D Andreev bound states' subbands that can
be present, and increasing the size of the topological superconducting gap, are
two fundamental challenges. It has been suggested that both problems can be
addressed by properly designing the interfaces between the JJ's normal region
and the superconducting leads. We fabricated Josephson junctions with periodic
hole structures on the superconducting contact leads on InAs heterostructures
with epitaxial superconducting Al. By depleting the chemical potential inside
the hole region with a top gate, we observed an enhancement of the supercurrent
across the junction. Such an enhancement is reproduced in theoretical
simulations. The theoretical analysis shows that the enhancement of the JJ's
critical current is achieved when the hole depletion is such to optimize the
matching of quasiparticles' wave-function at the normal/superconductor
interface. These results show how the combination of carefully designed
patterns for the Al coverage, and external gates, can be successfully used to
tune the density and wave functions' profiles in the normal region of the JJ,
and therefore open a new avenue to tune some of the critical properties, such
as number of subbands and size of the topological gap, that must be optimized
to obtain robust quasi 1D superconducting states supporting Majorana bound
states.

<p>Excitons are key to the optoelectronic applications of van der Waals
semiconductors with the potential for versatile on-demand tuning of properties.
Yet, their electrical manipulation is complicated by their inherent charge

demonstrate the dynamic control of valley polarization in charged biexciton
(quinton) states of monolayer tungsten disulfide, achieving up to a sixfold
increase in the degree of circular polarization under off-resonant excitation.
In contrast to the weak direct tuning of excitons typically observed using
electrical gating, the quinton photoluminescence remains stable, even with
increased scattering from electron doping. By exciting at the exciton
resonances, we observed the reproducible non-monotonic switching of the charged
state population as the electron doping is varied under gate bias, indicating a
coherent interplay between neutral and charged exciton states.

outstanding material for mechanical resonators due to its high Q/f product.
Moreover, epitaxial graphene layers can be grown as ultrathin electrodes and
provide the potential to fine-tune color center resonances. These
characteristics render SiC an ideal platform for experiments with single color
centers towards quantum technologies including coupling color centers towards
cooperative effects. A crucial step towards harnessing the full potential of
the SiC platform includes technologies to create color centers with defined
localization and density, e.g.\ to facilitate their coupling to nano-photonic
structures and to observe cooperative effects. Here, silicon vacancy centers
(V$_{Si}$) stand out as no impurity atom is needed and high-thermal budget
annealing steps can be avoided. We characterize the effect of localized,

<p>Graphene moir\'e systems are ideal environments for investigating complex
phase diagrams and gaining fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying
exotic states of matter, as they permit controlled manipulation of electronic
properties. Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as a key
platform to explore moir\'e superconductivity, owing to the robustness of its
superconducting order and the displacement-field tunability of its energy
bands. Recent measurements strongly suggest that superconductivity in MATTG is
unconventional. Here, we report the first direct observation of double-dome
superconductivity in MATTG. The temperature, magnetic field, and bias current
dependence of the superconductivity of doped holes collectively show that it is
significantly suppressed near moir\'e filling $\nu^* = -2.6$, leading to a
double dome in the phase diagram within a finite window of the displacement
field. The temperature dependence of the normal-state resistance and the $I-V$
curves straddling $\nu^*$ are suggestive of a phase transition and the
potentially distinct nature of superconductivity in the two domes. Hartree-Fock
calculations incorporating mild strain yield an incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral
state whose effective spin polarization peaks in the regime where
superconductivity is suppressed in experiments. This allows us to draw
conclusions about the normal state as well as the unconventional nature of the
superconducting order parameter.

<p>Electrostatically confined quantum dots in bilayer graphene have shown
potential as building blocks for quantum technologies. To operate the dots,
e.g., as qubits, a precise understanding and control of the confined states and
their properties is required. Herein, a large-scale numerical characterization
of confined quantum states in bilayer graphene dots is performed over an
extensive range of gate-tunable parameters such as the dot size, depth, shape,
and the bilayer graphene gap. The dot states' orbital degeneracy, wave function
distribution, and valley g-factor are established and the parametric
dependencies to achieve different regimes are provided. It is found that the
dot states are highly susceptible to gate-dependent confinement and material
parameters, enabling efficient tuning of confined states and valley g-factor
modulation by quantum dot design.

<p>Bulk photovoltaic effect is a non-linear response in noncentrosymmetric
materials that converts light to a DC current. In this work, we investigate the
optical linear and non-linear responses of the chalcopyrite semiconductor
ZnGeP$_2$. We report the enhancement of bulk photovoltaics namely shift and
circular photogalvanic (CPG) current conductivities due to intrinsic
contribution of Fermi surface along the high symmetry $\Gamma-Z$ direction. We
observe that the magnification of shift and CPG current conductivities around
the incident photon energy $\sim 5$ eV are about 38\% and 81\% respectively in
ZnGeP$_2$ due to shifting of Fermi level to 1.52 eV. To further verify our
findings, we explore distribution of bulk Fermi surface states in both three
dimensional Brillouin zone and surface Fermi surface distribution in the
projected energy landscape using semi infinite slab geometry. Our study not
only provides a deeper understanding of the roles of Fermi surface contribution
on the bulk photovoltaic responses, but also suggests the ZnGeP$_2$ is an ideal
candidate for optoelectronics.

<p>Normalizing flows can transform a simple prior probability distribution into
a more complex target distribution. Here, we evaluate the ability and
efficiency of generative machine learning methods to sample the Boltzmann
distribution of an atomistic model for glass-forming liquids. This is a
notoriously difficult task, as it amounts to ergodically exploring the complex
free energy landscape of a disordered and frustrated many-body system. We
optimize a normalizing flow model to successfully transform high-temperature
configurations of a dense liquid into low-temperature ones, near the glass
transition. We perform a detailed comparative analysis with established
enhanced sampling techniques developed in the physics literature to assess and
rank the performance of normalizing flows against state-of-the-art algorithms.
We demonstrate that machine learning methods are very promising, showing a
large speedup over conventional molecular dynamics. Normalizing flows show
performances comparable to parallel tempering and population annealing, while
still falling far behind the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. Our study highlights
the potential of generative machine learning models in scientific computing for
complex systems, but also points to some of its current limitations and the
need for further improvement.

<p>High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is
paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices
and optical tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range
from a millisecond to a second, which can significantly limit the cycle time.
In this work, we present fast, 2.4 us single-atom imaging in lattices, with
99.4% fidelity. Additionally, we resolve lattice sites spaced within the
diffraction limit by using accordion lattices to increase the atom spacing
before imaging. This overcomes the challenge of imaging small-spacing lattices
and enables the study of extended Hubbard models using magnetic atoms. We also
demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will
facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the
extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and
quantum link models.

<h3>Thermal conversion of ultrathin nickel hydroxide for wide bandgap 2D  nickel oxides</h3>

<p>Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors (Eg >2.0 eV) are integral to the
advancement of next generation electronics, optoelectronics, and power
industries, owing to their capability for high temperature operation, high
breakdown voltage and efficient light emission. Enhanced power efficiency and
functional performance can be attained through miniaturization, specifically
via the integration of device fabrication into two-dimensional (2D) structure
enabled by WBG 2D semiconductors. However, as an essential subgroup of WBG
semiconductors, 2D transition metal oxides (TMOs) remain largely underexplored
in terms of physical properties and applications in 2D opto-electronic devices,
primarily due to the scarcity of sufficiently large 2D crystals. Thus, our goal
is to develop synthesis pathways for 2D TMOs possessing large crystal domain
(e.g. >10 nm), expanding the 2D TMOs family and providing insights for future
engineering of 2D TMOs. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of WBG 2D nickel
oxide (NiO) (Eg > 2.7 eV) thermally converted from 2D nickel hydroxide
(Ni(OH)2) with the lateral domain size larger than 10 um. Moreover, the
conversion process is investigated using various microscopic techniques such as
atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), providing
significant insights on the morphology and structure variation under different
oxidative conditions. The electronic structure of the converted NixOy is
further investigated using multiple soft X-ray spectroscopies, such as X-ray
absorption (XAS) and emission spectroscopies (XES).

<h3>Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates:  Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09989" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09989</a>

</p><i>Fanjie Sun, Xiao Yan Xu</i>
<p>The study of strongly correlated fermionic systems, crucial for understanding
condensed matter physics, has been significantly advanced by numerical
computational methods. Among these, the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
method stands out for its ability to provide exact numerical solutions.
However, the computational complexity of DQMC, particularly in dealing with
large system sizes and the notorious sign problem, limits its applicability. We
introduce an innovative approach to enhance DQMC efficiency through the
implementation of submatrix updates. Building upon the foundational work of
conventional fast updates and delay updates, our method leverages a generalized
submatrix update algorithm to address challenges in simulating strongly
correlated fermionic systems with both onsite and extended interactions at both
finite and zero temperatures. We demonstrate the method's superiority by
comparing it with previous update methods in terms of computational complexity
and efficiency. Specifically, our submatrix update method significantly reduces
the computational overhead, enabling the simulation of system sizes up to 8,000
sites without pushing hard. This advancement allows for a more accurate
determination of the finite temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model
at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions
within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective
simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental
efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.
