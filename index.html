<h3>Thermal suppression of demixing dynamics in a binary condensate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04824" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04824</a>

We investigate the demixing dynamics in a binary two-dimensional (2D) Bose
superfluid using classical-field dynamics. By quenching the interspecies
interaction parameter, we identify a strong and weak separation regime
depending on the system temperature and the quench parameter. In the strong
separation regime our results are in agreement with the inertial hydrodynamic
domain growth law of binary fluids and a Porod scaling law for the structure
factor at zero temperature is found. In the weak separation regime thermal
fluctuations modify both the domain growth law and the Porod tail of the
structure factor. Near the superfluid transition temperature the scaling
dynamics approaches the diffusive growth law of a 2D conserved field. We then
analyze the demixing dynamics in a box cloud. For low quench we find
distinctive domain dynamics dictated by the boundary condition. Otherwise, the
dynamics are qualitatively similar to those of systems with periodic boundary
conditions.

<h3>Extracting higher central charge from a single wave function</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04822" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04822</a>
<br>

A (2+1)D topologically ordered phase may or may not have a gappable edge,
even if its chiral central charge $c_-$ is vanishing. Recently, it is
discovered that a quantity regarded as a ``higher'' version of chiral central
charge gives a further obstruction beyond $c_-$ to gapping out the edge. In
this Letter, we show that the higher central charges can be characterized by
the expectation value of the \textit{partial rotation} operator acting on the
wavefunction of the topologically ordered state. This allows us to extract the
higher central charge from a single wavefunction, which can be evaluated on a
quantum computer. Our characterization of the higher central charge is
analytically derived from the modular properties of edge conformal field
theory, as well as the numerical results with the $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin
state and the non-Abelian gapped phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model, which
corresponds to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ and Ising topological order respectively. The
letter establishes a numerical method to obtain a set of obstructions to the
gappable edge of (2+1)D bosonic topological order beyond $c_-$. We also point
out that the expectation values of the partial rotation on a single
wavefunction put a constraint on the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary
system of (2+1)D bosonic topological order, reminiscent of the
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorems.

<h3>Electrical control of magnetism in spin-orbit coupled graphene  multilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04855</a>
<br>

<br>
Electrical control of magnetism has been a major techonogical pursuit of the
spintronics community, owing to its far-reaching implications for data storage
and transmission. Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for electrical
switching of magnetism, using chiral-stacked graphene multilayers encapsulated
by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) substrates. Leveraging the
proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from the TMD, we demonstrate switching of
correlation-induced spin or orbital ferromagnetism by reversing a perpendicular
displacement field. We substantiate our proposal with both analytical arguments
and self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerics based on realistic parameters.
Finally, we illustrate how the displacement field can selectively switch
orbital or spin polarization, putting forward correlated van der Waals
heterostructures as promising platforms for spintronics and orbitronics.

<h3>Spontaneous off-stoichiometry as the knob to control dielectric  properties of gapped metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04872" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04872</a>

<br>
<br>
Using the first-principles calculations and La3Te4 as an example of an n-type
gapped metal, we demonstrate that gapped metals can develop spontaneous defect
formation resulting in off-stoichiometric compounds. Importantly, these
compounds have different free carrier concentrations and can be realized by
optimizing synthesis conditions. The ability to manipulate the free carrier
concentration allows to tailor intraband and interband transitions, thus
controlling the optoelectronic properties of materials in general.
Specifically, by realizing different off-stochiometric La3-xTe4 compounds, it
is possible to reach specific crossings of the real part of the dielectric
function with the zero line, reduce plasma frequency contribution to absorption
spectra, or, more generally, induce metal-to-insulator transition. This is
particularly important in the context of optoelectronic, plasmonic, and
epsilon-near-zero materials, as it enables materials design with a target
functionality. While this work is limited to the specific gapped metal, we
demonstrate that the fundamental physics is transferable to other gapped metals
and can be generally used to design a wide class of new
optoelectronic/plasmonic materials.

<h3>Spontaneous topological Hall effect induced by non-coplanar  antiferromagnetic order in intercalated van der Waals materials</h3>

In ferromagnets, electric current generally induces transverse Hall voltage
in proportion to magnetization (anomalous Hall effect), and it is frequently
used for electrical readout of the up and down spin states. While these
properties are usually not expected in antiferromagnets, recent theoretical
studies predicted that non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order with finite scalar
spin chirality (i.e. solid angle spanned by neighboring spins) can often induce
large spontaneous Hall effect even without net magnetization or external
magnetic field. This phenomenon, i.e. spontaneous topological Hall effect, can
potentially be used for the efficient electrical readout of the
antiferromagnetic states, but its experimental verification has long been
elusive due to the lack of appropriate materials hosting such exotic magnetism.
Here, we report the discovery of all-in-all-out type non-coplanar
antiferromagnetic order in triangular lattice compounds CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6, by
performing the detailed magnetic structure analysis based on polarized neutron
scattering experiments as well as systematic first-principles calculations.
These compounds are reported to host unconventionally large spontaneous Hall
effect despite their vanishingly small net magnetization, and our analysis
revealed that it can be well explained in terms of topological Hall effect,
which originates from the fictitious magnetic field associated with scalar spin
chirality in non-coplanar antiferromagnetic orders. The present results
indicate that the scalar spin chirality mechanism can offer a promising route
to realize giant spontaneous Hall response even in compensated
antiferromagnets, and highlight intercalated van der Waals magnets as an unique
quasi-two-dimensional material platform to enable various nontrivial manner of
electrical reading and possible writing of non-coplanar antiferromagnetic
domains.

<h3>Light-Induced Transitions of Polar State and Domain Morphology in  Photo-Ferroelectric Nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04904" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04904</a>
<br>
<i>Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska, Yulian M. Vysochanskii, Lesya P. Yurchenko, Venkatraman Gopalan, Long-Qing Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, we study light-induced phase
transitions, accompanied by transformations of polar state and domain
morphology in photo-ferroelectric nanoparticles (NPs). Due to the light-induced
increase of the free carrier density near the NP surface, the light exposure
induces phase transitions from the nonpolar paraelectric to the polar
ferroelectric phase, causes the changes of domain morphology in the
ferroelectric phase, and can control the phase diagram of the free and stressed
NPs. Visible light exposure induces the appearance and vanishing of striped,
labyrinthine or curled domains in the NPs of uniaxial photo-ferroelectric
Sn2P2S6. We reveal that the light exposure can change the polarization
switching scenario and hysteresis loop shape from paraelectric curves to
double, pinched and single loops, as well as it can shift the position of the
morphological phase transitions and tricritical point, where the energy barrier
of polarization switching vanishes, to the working (e.g., room) temperature.
When exposed to light, an ensemble of non-interacting photo-ferroelectric NPs
can reveal superparaelectric-like features in the tricritical point, such as
strongly frequency-dependent giant piezoelectric and dielectric responses,
which can be important for advanced piezoelectric applications.

<h3>Configuration-specific insight to single-molecule conductance and noise  data revealed by principal component projection method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04914</a>
<br>
<i>Zoltán Balogh, Gréta Mezei, Nóra Tenk, András Magyarkuti, András Halbritter</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the merits of neural network boosted,
principal-component-projection-based, unsupervised data classification in
single-molecule break junction measurements, demonstrating that this method
identifies highly relevant trace classes according to the well-defined and
well-visualized internal correlations of the dataset. To this end, we
investigate single-molecule structures exhibiting double molecular
configurations, exploring the role of the leading principal components in the
identification of alternative junction evolution trajectories. We show how the
proper principal component projections can be applied to separately analyze the
high or low-conductance molecular configurations, which we exploit in
$1/f$-type noise measurements on bipyridine molecules. This approach untangles
the unclear noise evolution of the entire dataset, identifying the coupling of
the aromatic ring to the electrodes through the $\pi$ orbitals in two distinct
conductance regions, and its subsequent uncoupling as these configurations are
stretched.

<h3>Material-Geometry Interplay in Damping of Biomimetic Scale Beams</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04920" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04920</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Biomimetic scale-covered substrates are architected meta-structures
exhibiting fascinating emergent nonlinearities via the geometry of collective
scales contacts. In spite of much progress in understanding their elastic
nonlinearity, their dissipative behavior arising from scales sliding is
relatively uninvestigated in the dynamic regime. Recently discovered is the
phenomena of viscous emergence, where dry Coulomb friction between scales can
lead to apparent viscous damping behavior of the overall multi-material
substrate. In contrast to this structural dissipation, material dissipation
common in many polymers has never been considered, especially synergestically
with geometrical factors. This is addressed here for the first time, where
material visco-elasticity is introduced via a simple Kelvin-Voigt model for
brevity and clarity. The results contrast the two damping sources in these
architectured systems: material viscoelasticity, and geometrical frictional
scales contact. It is discovered that although topically similar in effective
damping, viscoelsatic damping follows a different damping envelope than dry
friction, including starkly different effects on damping symmetry and specific
damping capacity.

<h3>Emergent topological quantum orbits in the charge density wave phase of  kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04924</a>

<br>
<br>
The recently discovered kagome materials $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs)
attract intense research interest in intertwined topology, superconductivity,
and charge density waves (CDW). Although the in-plane $2\times2$ CDW is well
studied, its out-of-plane structural correlation with the Fermi surface
properties is less understood. In this work, we advance the theoretical
description of quantum oscillations and investigate the Fermi surface
properties in the three-dimensional CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We derived
Fermi-energy-resolved and layer-resolved quantum orbits that agree
quantitatively with recent experiments in the fundamental frequency, cyclotron
mass, and topology. We reveal a complex Dirac nodal network that would lead to
a $\pi$ Berry phase of a quantum orbit in the spinless case. However, the phase
shift of topological quantum orbits is contributed by the orbital moment and
Zeeman effect besides the Berry phase in the presence of spin-orbital coupling
(SOC). Therefore, we can observe topological quantum orbits with a $\pi$ phase
shift in otherwise trivial orbits without SOC, contrary to common perception.
Our work reveals the rich topological nature of kagome materials and paves a
path to resolve different topological origins of quantum orbits.

<h3>Exploring Spin AGP Ansatze for Strongly Correlated Spin Systems</h3>

The antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP), a wave function equivalent to
number-projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB), has proven to be an excellent
reference for strong pairing interactions. Several correlation methods have
also been applied on top of AGP. In this work, we show how AGP can also be
applied to spin systems by simply basing its formulation on a spin $su(2)$
algebra. We here implement spin AGP and spin AGP-based correlation techniques
on the XXZ and $\mathrm{J_1-J_2}$ Heisenberg models, both in 1 and 2
dimensions. Our results indicate that AGP is a promising starting pointing for
modeling spin systems.

<h3>Spin-orbital mechanisms for negative thermal expansion in Ca2RuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04951" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04951</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The phenomenon of negative thermal expansion (NTE) deals with the increase of
the lattice parameters and the volume of the unit cell when the material is
thermally cooled. The NTE is typically associated with thermal phonons and
anomalous spin-lattice coupling at low temperatures. However, the underlying
mechanisms in the presence of strong electron correlations in multi-orbital
systems are not yet fully established. Here, we investigate the role of Coulomb
interaction in the presence of lattice distortions in setting out the NTE
effect, by focusing on the physical case of layered Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ with $d^4$
configuration at each Ru ion site. We employ the Slater-Koster parametrization
to describe the electron-lattice coupling through the dependence of the $d-p$
hybridization on the Ru-O-Ru bond angle. The evaluation of the minimum of the
free energy at finite temperature by fully solving the multi-orbital many-body
problem on finite size cluster allows us to identify the regime for which the
system is prone to exhibit NTE effects. The analysis shows that the nature of
the spin-orbital correlations is relevant to drive the reduction of the bond
angle by cooling, and in turn the tendency toward a NTE. This is confirmed by
the fact that a changeover of the electronic and orbital configuration from
$d^4$ to $d^3$ by transition metal substitution is shown to favor the
occurrence of NTE in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. This finding is in agreement with the
experimental observations of a NTE effect which is significantly dependent on
the transition metal substitution in the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ compound.

<br>
<br>
For semiconductor spin qubits, complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
technology is the ideal candidate for reliable and scalable fabrication. Making
the direct leap from academic fabrication to qubits fabricated fully by
industrial CMOS standards is difficult without intermediate solutions. With a
flexible back-end-of-line (BEOL) new functionalities such as micromagnets or
superconducting circuits can be added in a post-CMOS process to study the
physics of these devices or achieve proof of concepts. Once the process is
established it can be incorporated in the foundry-compatible process flow.
Here, we study a single electron spin qubit in a CMOS device with a micromagnet
integrated in the flexible BEOL. We exploit the synthetic spin orbit coupling
(SOC) to control the qubit via electric field and we investigate the
spin-valley physics in the presence of SOC where we show an enhancement of the
Rabi frequency at the spin-valley hotspot. Finally, we probe the high frequency
noise in the system using dynamical decoupling pulse sequences and demonstrate
that charge noise dominates the qubit decoherence in this range.

<h3>Planckian behaviour in the optical conductivity of the weakly coupled  Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04964</a>
<br>
<i>M. Grandadam, J. P. F. LeBlanc</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the frequency and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity
in the weakly coupled two-dimensional Hubbard model using a renormalized
perturbative expansion. The perturbative expansion is based on the skeleton
series for the current-current correlation function with a dressed Green`s
function and the results are obtained directly on the real frequency axis using
Algorithmic Matsubara Integration (AMI). The resulting conductivity shows a
temperature-independent power law behaviour in the intermediate frequency
regime. Moreover, the associated transport scattering time and renormalized
mass exhibit a Planckian behaviour. We show that the self-energy of the Hubbard
model, however, is distinct from existing Planckian models. The Planckian
behaviour of the conductivity, observed in optimally doped cuprates for
example, can thus be obtained from a different form of self-energy than the
Planckian model, such as the weakly coupled Hubbard model at half-filling.

<h3>Probing the electronic topological transitions of WTe2 under pressure  using ultrafast spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04974" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04974</a>
<br>
<i>Kai Zhang, Fuhai Su, Dayong Liu, Wenjun Wang, Yongsheng Zhang, Zhi Zeng, Zhe Qu, Alexander F. Goncharov</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the nonequilibrium photocarrier dynamics of WTe2 under
pressure using the optical pump-probe spectroscopy. The pressure dependences of
the electronic relaxation manifest anomalous changes around 0.8, 3.5, and 6
GPa, indicating the abruptions in the electron-phonon interactions. In
addition, the coherent phonon oscillations originating from shear mode suddenly
disappears above 3.5 GPa, which marks the onset of Td-1T' structural phase
transition. Supported by the theoretical calculation, we unveil the electronic
topological transitions (ETTs), especially an emergence of a new type-II Weyl
point for Td-WTe2 under pressure. Our work demonstrates a novel route to probe
the ETTs under pressure.

<h3>Universal bounds and thermodynamic tradeoffs in nonequilibrium energy  harvesting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04975" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04975</a>
<br>
<i>Jordi Piñero, Ricard Solé, Artemy Kolchinsky</i>
<br>
<br>
Many molecular systems operate by harvesting and storing energy from their
environments. However, the maintenance of a nonequilibrium state necessary to
support energy harvesting itself carries thermodynamic costs. We consider the
optimal tradeoff between costs and benefits of energy harvesting in a
nonequilibrium steady state, for a system that may be in contact with a
fluctuating environment. We find a universal bound on this tradeoff, which
leads to closed-form expressions for optimal power output and optimal
steady-state distributions for three physically meaningful regimes. Our results
are illustrated using a model of a unicyclic network, which is inspired by the
logic of biomolecular cycles.

<h3>Electron addition spectral functions of low-density polaron liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05013" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05013</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Spectral functions are important quantities that contain a wealth of
information about the quasiparticles of a system, and that can also be measured
experimentally. For systems with electron-phonon coupling, good approximations
for the spectral function are available only in the Migdal limit (at Fermi
energies much larger than the typical phonon frequency, $E_F\gg \Omega$,
requiring a large carrier concentration $x$) and in the single polaron limit
(at $x=0$). Here we show that the region with $x\ll 1$ ($E_F <\Omega$) can also
be reliably investigated with the Momentum Average (MA) variational
approximation, which essentially describes the formation of a polaron above an
inert Fermi sea. Specifically, we show that for the one-dimensional spinless
Holstein model, the MA spectral functions compare favorably with those
calculated using variationally exact density matrix renormalization group
simulations (DMRG) evaluated directly in frequency-space, so long as $x<0.1$
and the adiabaticity ratio $\Omega/t>0.5$. Unlike in the Migdal limit, here
'polaronic physics' emerges already at moderate couplings. The relevance of
these results for a spinful low-$x$ metal is also discussed.

<h3>Topological two-band electron-hole superconductors with $d$-wave  symmetry: a possible application to magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05017" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05017</a>
<br>
<i>Senne Van Loon, Carlos A. R. Sa de Melo</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss a two-band model for two-dimensional superconductors with electron
and hole bands separated by an energy gap and singlet $d$-wave pairing in each
band. This model exhibits a V-shaped to U-shaped transition in the density of
the states of the superconductor, which is similar to that found in recent
tunneling experiments in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene [H. Kim et al.,
Nature 606, 494 (2022)]. This qualitative difference in behavior occurs when
the electron and hole chemical potentials change, leading to topological
quantum phase transitions between gapless and gapful $d$-wave superconducting
states, due to the annihilation of chiral Dirac fermions at the critical
points. Lastly, we show that direct thermodynamic evidence of these topological
quantum phase transitions can be found in measurements of the compressibility,
which exhibits logarithmic singularities at the transition points.

<h3>Magnetic field filtering of the hinge supercurrent in unconventional  metal NiTe$_2$-based Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
Topological materials with boundary (surface/edge/hinge) states have
attracted tremendous research interest. Besides, unconventional (obstructed
atomic) materials have recently drawn lots of attention owing to their
obstructed boundary states. Experimentally, Josephson junctions (JJs)
constructed on materials with boundary states produce the peculiar boundary
supercurrent, which was utilized as a powerful diagnostic approach. Here, we
report the observations of conspicuous hinge supercurrent in NiTe$_2$-based
JJs. Particularly, applying an in-plane magnetic field along the Josephson
current could rapidly suppress the bulk supercurrent and retain the nearly pure
hinge supercurrent, namely the magnetic field filtering of supercurrent.
Further systematic comparative analysis and theoretical calculations
demonstrate the existence of unconventional nature and obstructed hinge states
in NiTe$_2$. Our results revealed the unique hinge states in unconventional
metal NiTe$_2$, and demonstrated in-plane magnetic field as an efficient method
to filter out the futile bulk contributions and thereby to highlight the hinge
states hidden in topological/unconventional materials.

<h3>Topological Invariant for Multi-Band Non-hermitian Systems with Chiral  Symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05053" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05053</a>

<i>ChunChi Liu, LiuHao Li, Jin An</i>
<br>
<br>
Topology plays an important role in non-hermitian systems. How to
characterize a non-hermitian topological system under open-boundary
conditions(OBCs) is a challenging problem. A one-dimensional(1D) topological
invariant defined on a generalized Brillion zone(GBZ) was recently found to
successfully describe the topological property of the two-band
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. But for a 1D multi-band chiral symmetric system
under OBCs, it is still controversial how to define the topological invariant.
We show in this letter by exact proof and detailed demonstration that to
acquire the topological invariant for multi-band non-hermitian models with
chiral symmetry, the GBZ as the integral domain should be replaced by a more
generalized closed loop. Our work thus establishes the non-Bloch bulk-boundary
correspondence for 1D multi-band chiral symmetric non-hermitian systems.

<h3>Heat transfer across a vacuum gap induced by piezoelectrically mediated  acoustic phonon tunneling</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhuoran Geng, Ilari J. Maasilta</i>
<br>
<br>
In contradictin to the common concept that acoustic phonons can only travel
inside a material medium, they can in fact "tunnel" across a vacuum gap with
the help of piezoelectricity, transmitting a significantly stronger heat flux
than that of blackbody radiation. Here, we present a theoretical formulation
for the heat flux of such piezoelectrically mediated heat transfer, applicable
to any anisotropic piezoelectric crystals with an arbitrary orientation. A few
numerical results are demonstrated and compared to heat transfer driven by
other close-range mechanisms, including near-field radiative heat transfer and
other acoustic phonon tunneling mechanisms. We find that piezoelectrically
mediated heat transfer has a significant effect when the vacuum gap size is
smaller than the phonon characteristic thermal wavelength, and its heat flux
can dominate heat transfer between piezoelectric solids over all other known
heat transfer mechanisms at temperatures below 50 K.

interface, the wavefunction at the SiC conduction band minimum was calculated
using density functional theory under an applied electric field. We found that
the wavefunction for a 4H-SiC (0001) slab tends to be localized at the cubic
site closest to the interface. Importantly, because the conduction electrons
are distributed closer to the interface (< 5 angstroms) than expected from the
effective mass approximation (EMA), they are more frequently scattered by
interface defects. This is expected to be the reason why the channel
conductivity for the (0001) face is particularly low compared with that for
other faces, such as (11-20). The breakdown of the EMA for the (0001) interface
is related to the long structural periodicity along the [0001] direction in
4H-SiC crystals.

Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in the infinite-layer
nickelate family, we report an experimental endeavor to clean the surface of
nickelate superconductor Pr0.8Sr0.2NiO2 films by Ar+ ion sputtering and
subsequent annealing, and we study their electronic structures by cryogenic
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The annealed surfaces are
characterized by nano-sized clusters and Coulomb staircases with periodicity
inversely proportional to the projected area of the nanoclusters, consistent
with a double-barrier tunneling junction model. Moreover, the dynamical Coulomb
blockade effects are observed and result in well-defined energy gaps around the
Fermi level, which correlate closely with the specific configuration of the
junctions. These Coulomb blockade-related phenomena provide an alternative
plausible cause of the observed gap structure that should be considered in the
spectroscopic understanding of nickelate superconductors with the
nano-clustered surface.

Creating materials that do not exist in nature can lead to breakthroughs in
science and technology. Magnetic skyrmions are topological excitations that
have attracted great attention recently for their potential applications in low
power, ultrahigh density memory. A major challenge has been to find materials
that meet the dual requirement of small skyrmions stable at room temperature.
Here we meet both these goals by developing epitaxial FeGe films with excess Fe
using atomic layer molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) far from thermal equilibrium.
Our novel atomic layer design permits the incorporation of 20% excess Fe while
maintaining a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure supported by theoretical
calculations and necessary for stabilizing skyrmions. We show that the Curie
temperature is well above room temperature, and that the skyrmions probed by
topological Hall effect have sizes down to 15 nm as imaged by Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and magnetic force microscopy (MFM).
Our results illustrate new avenues for creating artificial materials tailored
at the atomic scale that can impact nanotechnology.

The need for faster and more miniaturised electronics is challenging
scientists to develop novel forms of electronics based on quantum degrees of
freedom different from electron charge. In this fast-developing field, often
referred to as quantum electronics, the metal-oxide perovskite SrRuO3 can play
an important role thanks to its diverse physical properties, which have been
intensively investigated, mostly for conventional electronics. In addition to
being chemically stable, easy to fabricate with high quality and to grow
epitaxially onto many oxides - these are all desirable properties also for
conventional electronics - SrRuO3 has interesting properties for quantum
electronics like itinerant ferromagnetism and metallic behaviour, strong
correlation between magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit coupling,
strain-tuneable magnetisation, anomalous Hall and Berry effects. In this
Research Update, after describing the main phenomena emerging from the
interplay between spin, orbital, lattice and topological quantum degrees of
freedom in SrRuO3, we discuss the challenges still open to achieve control over
these phenomena. We then provide our perspectives on the most promising
applications of SrRuO3 for devices for conventional and quantum electronics. We
suggest new device configurations and discuss the materials challenges for
their realisation. For conventional electronics, we single out applications
where SrRuO3 devices can bring competitive advantages over existing ones. For
quantum electronics, we propose devices that can help gain a deeper
understanding of quantum effects in SrRuO3 to exploit them for quantum
technologies. We finally give an outlook about properties of SrRuO3 still
waiting for discovery and applications that may stem from them.

The polyhydride of lutetium with f shell full filled was experimentally found
to be high temperature superconductor. The lutetium polyhydride was
successfully synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by a
diamond anvil cell apparatus in combinations with in-situ high pressure laser
heating technique. The resistance measurements as function of temperature were
performed at the same pressure of synthesis to study the transition of its
superconductivity (SC). The superconducting transition with a maximum onset
temperature (Tc) 71 K was observed at the highest pressure of 218 GPa in the
experiments. The Tc decreases to 65 K when pressure is released to 181 GPa.
From the studies of SC evolution at applied magnetic field, the upper critical
field at zero temperature u0Hc2(0) is obtained to be ~36 Tesla. The in-situ
high pressure X-ray diffraction experiments imply that the high Tc SC should
arise from Pm3-n of Lu4H23 phase that forms a new type of hydrogen cage
framework different from those reported for previous rare earth polyhydride
superconductors.

measurements of spin-orbit and d-d excitations in exfoliated nanolayers of the

independent of thickness, we observe a pronounced red-shift and broadening of
the d-d excitations in layers with thickness below $\sim$7 nm. Aided by model
calculations, we attribute these effects to distortions of the RuCl$_6$
octahedra near the surface. Our study paves the way towards RIXS investigations

<br>
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on all-two dimensional (2D) van der
Waals heterostructures with sharp and clean interfaces in atomic scale are
essential for the application of next-generation spintronics. However, the lack
of room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic crystals with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy has greatly hindered the development of vertical MTJs. The
discovery of room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic 2D crystal Fe3GaTe2 has
solved the problem and greatly facilitated the realization of practical
spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a room-temperature MTJ based on
Fe3GaTe2/WS2/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. The tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR)
ratio is up to 213% with high spin polarization of 72% at 10 K, the highest
ever reported in Fe3GaTe2-based MTJs up to now. The tunnelling spin-valve
signal robustly exists at room temperature (300 K) with bias current down to 10
nA. Moreover, the spin polarization can be modulated by bias current and the
TMR shows a sign reversal at large bias current. Our work sheds light on the
potential application for low-energy consumption all-2D vdW spintronics and
offers alternative routes for the electronic control of spintronic devices.

In this work, we study magnetization dynamics in superconductor-ferromagnet
(S-F) thin-film multilayer. Theoretical considerations supported by the
broad-band ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal development of acoustic
and optic resonance modes in S-F multilayers. These modes are formed due to
antiferromagnetic-like interaction between F-layers via superconducting
currents circulating in S-layers at significantly higher frequencies in
comparison to the Kittel mode of individual F-layers. The gap between resonance
modes is determined by the thickness and superconducting penetration depth in
S-layers. Overall, rich spectrum of S-F multilayers and its tunability opens
wide prospects for application of these multialyers in magnonics as well as in
various superconducting systems.

We consider the many-body ground state of polarized fermions interacting via
zero-range p-wave forces in a one-dimensional geometry. We rigorously prove
that in the limit of infinite attractions spectral properties of any-order
reduced density matrix describing arbitrary subsystem are completely
independent of the shape of an external potential. It means that quantum
correlations between any two subsystems are in this limit insensitive to the
confinement. In addition, we show that the purity of these matrices quantifying
the amount of quantum correlations can be obtained analytically for any number
of particles without diagonalizing them. This observation may serve as a
rigorous benchmark for other methods describing strongly interacting p-wave
fermions.

Radionuclides sequestration through adsorption technology has attracted much
attention due to its unique characters such as high removal efficiency, low
cost, and ease of operation. In this work, the interaction mechanism of
N-functionalized Ti2C MXene (Ti2CN2) as a potential adsorbent for the removal
of strontium ions is investigated by using first principles method. Our results
show that surface N atoms are connected to Sr ions by a robust chemical N-Sr
bond, which provides a more stable adsorption of Sr ions on Ti2CN2 than that
with other surficial groups Ti2CT2 (T= O, F and OH). Furthermore, Ti2CN2
exhibits a unique double-layer adsorption mode for Sr ions, endowing it with an
ultra-high adsorption capacity (1.864 g g-1), much higher than that of other
Ti2CTx MXenes. Our results are expected to provide a new perspective for the
design of MXene materials as adsorbent for radionuclide.

The progress in two-dimensional materials has led to rapid experimental
developments in quantum plasmonics, where light is manipulated using plasmons.
Although numerical methods can be used to quantitatively describe plasmons in
spatially inhomogeneous systems, they are limited to relatively small setups.
Here, we present a novel semi-analytical method to describe plasmons in
two-dimensional inhomogeneous media within the framework of the Random Phase
Approximation (RPA). Our approach is based on the semiclassical approximation,
which is formally applicable when the length scale of the inhomogeneity is much
larger than the plasmon wavelength. We obtain an effective classical
Hamiltonian for quantum plasmons by first separating the in-plane and
out-of-plane degrees of freedom and subsequently employing the semiclassical
Ansatz for the electrostatic plasmon potential. We develop a theory for
scattering of plasmons by radially symmetric inhomogeneities, and compute the
total and differential scattering cross section for a specific model of the
inhomogeneity.

Scale invariance and self-similarity in physics provide a unified framework
to classify phases of matter and dynamical properties of near-equilibrium
systems. However, extending this framework to far-from-equilibrium quantum
many-body systems and categorizing their dynamics have remained a major
challenge in physics. Here, we report on the first classification of universal
coarsening dynamics in a quenched two-dimensional ferromagnetic spinor Bose
gas. We observe spatiotemporal scaling of spin correlation functions with
distinguishable scaling exponents, $1/z=0.58(2)$ and $1/z=0.43(2)$,
characteristic, respectively, of binary and diffusive fluids. We find the
universality class of the coarsening dynamics are determined by the symmetry of
the order parameters and the annihilation dynamics of the topological defects.
These observations are in excellent agreement with many-body simulations. Our
results represent a paradigmatic example of categorizing far-from-equilibrium
dynamics in quantum many-body systems.

The study of entanglement in the symmetry sectors of a theory has recently
attracted a lot of attention since it provides better understanding of some
aspects of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we extend this analysis to
the case of non-Hermitian models, in which the reduced density matrix $\rho_A$
may be non-positive definite and the entanglement entropy negative or even
complex. Here we examine in detail the symmetry-resolved entanglement in the
ground state of the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain at the critical
point, a model that preserves particle number and whose scaling limit is a
$bc$-ghost non-unitary CFT. By combining bosonization techniques in the field
theory and exact lattice numerical calculations, we analytically derive the
charged moments of $\rho_A$ and $|\rho_A|$. From them, we can understand the
origin of the non-positiveness of $\rho_A$ and naturally define a
positive-definite reduced density matrix in each charge sector, which gives a
well-defined symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy. As byproduct, we also
obtain the analytical distribution of the critical entanglement spectrum.

We study the maximum-average submatrix problem, in which given an $N \times
N$ matrix $J$ one needs to find the $k \times k$ submatrix with the largest
average of entries. We study the problem for random matrices $J$ whose entries
are i.i.d. random variables by mapping it to a variant of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model at fixed magnetization. We
characterize analytically the phase diagram of the model as a function of the
submatrix average and the size of the submatrix $k$ in the limit $N\to\infty$.
We consider submatrices of size $k = m N$ with $0 < m < 1$. We find a rich
phase diagram, including dynamical, static one-step replica symmetry breaking
and full-step replica symmetry breaking. In the limit of $m \to 0$, we find a
simpler phase diagram featuring a frozen 1-RSB phase, where the Gibbs measure
is composed of exponentially many pure states each with zero entropy.

The study of atmospheric ice nuclei is vital for understanding the formation
of precipitation and the development of cloud systems as it reveals how these
tiny particles grow. A mechanism of such growth when the nuclei are in a mixed
ice/water phase and quantum vacuum fluctuation-induced Casimir-Lifshitz
interaction highlights the complexity and interconnection of the atmospheric
processes with quantum theory. Initially of the order of $0.1\sim10\rm\mu m$ in
size, atmospheric ice nuclei can expand by the accumulation of water molecules
from the surrounding water vapor.

<br>
<br>
Measured transport properties of three representative cuprates are reproduced
within the paradigm of two electron subsystems, itinerant and localized. The
localized subsystem evolves continuously from the Cu 3d$^9$ hole at
half-filling and corresponds to the (pseudo)gapped parts of the Fermi surface.
The itinerant subsystem is observed as a pure Fermi liquid (FL) with
material-independent universal mobility across the doping/temperature phase
diagram. The localized subsystem affects the itinerant one in our transport
calculations solely by truncating the textbook FL integrals to the observed
(doping- and temperature-dependent) Fermi arcs. With this extremely simple
picture, we obtain the measured evolution of the resistivity and Hall
coefficients in all three cases considered, including LSCO which undergoes a
Lifshitz transition in the relevant doping range, a complication which turns
out to be superficial. Our results imply that prior to evoking polaronic,
quantum critical point, quantum dissipation, or even more exotic scenarios for
the evolution of transport properties in cuprates, Fermi-surface properties
must be addressed in realistic detail.

<br>
<br>
By using dielectric spectroscopy in a broad range of temperatures and
frequencies, we have investigated dipolar relaxations, the dc conductivity, and
the possible occurrence of polar order in AgCN. Conductivity contributions
dominate the dielectric response at elevated temperatures and low frequencies,
most likely arising from the mobility of the small silver ions. In addition, we
observe dipolar relaxation dynamics of the dumbbell-shaped CN- ions, whose
temperature dependence follows Arrhenius behavior with a hindering barrier of
0.59 eV. It correlates well with a systematic development of the relaxation
dynamics with the cation radius, previously observed in various alkali
cyanides. By comparison with the latter, we conclude that AgCN does not exhibit
a plastic high-temperature phase with a free rotation of the cyanide ions.
Instead, our results indicate that a phase with quadrupolar order, revealing
dipolar head-to-tail disorder of the CN- ions, exists at elevated temperatures
up to the decomposition temperature, which crosses over to long-range polar
order of the CN dipole moments below about 475 K. Dipole ordering was also
reported for NaCN and KCN and a comparison with these systems suggests a
critical relaxation rate of 10^5 - 10^7 Hz marking the onset of dipolar order
in the cyanides. The detected relaxation dynamics in this order-disorder type
polar state points to glasslike freezing below about 195 K of a fraction of
non-ordered CN dipoles.

The pairing symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in iron-based
superconductors has been a subject of debate, with various models proposing
s-wave, d-wave, and mixed combinations as possible candidates. Here we probe
the pairing symmetry of FeSe utilizing the new methodology of Tunneling Andreev
Reflection (TAR). TAR directly exploits the transparency-dependence of
tunneling current to disentangle contributions of single-particle current and
Andreev reflection. These measurements provided new direct evidence in favor of
the sign-changing nature of the superconducting order in FeSe, in a distinctly
complementary approach to nanoscale imaging of quasiparticle interference.
Crucially TAR can also probe higher-order contributions to Andreev reflection.
Quantitative comparison of the experimental signatures of higher-order Andreev
reflections with those in concomitant tight-binding simulations revealed new
evidence in support of the nodal gap structure of superconductivity in FeSe.
Finally, the effect of structural topological defects can be directly probed
with TAR owing to its atomic spatial resolution. In particular, we find that
superconductivity is completely suppressed along the twin boundary while its
electronic structure is characterized by a V-shaped signature of a pseudogap
state. Our findings provide new insight into the pairing symmetry of an
unconventional superconductor, demonstrating the potential of differential
tunneling Andreev reflection to reveal microscopic properties of emerging
quantum materials.

<h3>Absorbing State Phase Transition with Clifford Circuits</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The role of quantum fluctuations in modifying the critical behavior of
non-equilibrium phase transitions is a fundamental but unsolved question. In
this study, we examine the absorbing state phase transition of a 1D chain of
qubits undergoing a contact process that involves both coherent and classical
dynamics. We adopt a discrete-time quantum model with states that can be
described in the stabilizer formalism, and therefore allows for an efficient
simulation of large system sizes. The extracted critical exponents indicate
that the absorbing state phase transition of this Clifford circuit model
belongs to the directed percolation universality class. This suggests that the
inclusion of quantum fluctuations does not necessarily alter the critical
behavior of non-equilibrium phase transitions of purely classical systems.
Finally, we extend our analysis to a non-Clifford circuit model, where a
tentative scaling analysis in small systems reveals critical exponents that are
also consistent with the directed percolation universality class.

<h3>Adhesive contact mechanics of viscoelastic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05319" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05319</a>
<br>
<i>C. Mandriota, N. Menga, G. Carbone</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we propose a theory of adhesive contact of viscoelastic
materials in steady state motion. By exploiting a boundary formulation based on
Green's function approach, the unknown contact domain is calculated by
enforcing a proper local energy balance that takes into account for the
contribution of the non-conservative work of internal stresses. The latter is
directly related to the odd part of the Green function. The theory predicts
that, within a certain a range of velocities, the interaction between adhesion
and viscoelasticity leads to enhanced adhesive performance, i.e. larger contact
area and pull-o? force, compared to the equivalent adhesive elastic case. At
low velocity friction is also strongly enhanced compared to the adhesiveless
viscoelastic case, mainly as a consequence of adhesion hysteresis induced by
the small-scale viscoelasticity. However, at intermediate and high velocity
values, the effect of viscoelastic hysteresis occurring at larger scales, i.e.
into the bulk, causes friction to increase further. Under these conditions, due
to the presence of adhesion, small-scale and bulk contribution to friction
cannot be linearly separated. As consequence of the finiteness of the contact
length, the energy release rates follow a non-monotonic trend, which is not
observed during crack propagation or healing in infinite systems. All the
presented results are strongly supported by existing experimental evidences.

<br>
Polymer brush layers are responsive materials that swell in contact with good
solvents and their vapors. We deposit drops of an almost completely wetting
volatile oil onto an oleophilic polymer brush layer and follow the response of
the system upon simultaneous exposure to both liquid and vapor. Interferometric
imaging shows that a halo of partly swollen polymer brush layer forms ahead of
the moving contact line. The swelling dynamics of this halo is controlled by a
subtle balance of direct imbibition from the drop into the brush layer and
vapor phase transport and can lead to very long-lived transient swelling
profiles as well as non-equilibrium configurations involving thickness
gradients in a stationary state. A gradient dynamics model based on a free
energy functional with three coupled fields is developed and numerically
solved. It describes experimental observations and reveals how local
evaporation and condensation conspire to stabilize the inhomogeneous
non-equilibrium stationary swelling profiles. A quantitative comparison of
experiments and calculations provides access to the solvent diffusion
coefficient within the brush layer. Overall, the results highlight the -
presumably generally applicable - crucial role of vapor phase transport in
dynamic wetting phenomena involving volatile liquids on swelling functional
surfaces.

Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) have recently shown that the Griffith
criticality condition that governs crack growth in viscoelastic elastomers can
be reduced to a fundamental form that involves exclusively the intrinsic
fracture energy $G_c$ of the elastomer and, in so doing, they have brought
resolution to the complete description of the historically elusive notion of
critical tearing energy $T_c$. The purpose of this paper -- which can be viewed
as the third installment of the series started by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies

popular fracture tests for probing the growth of cracks in viscoelastic

The interplay of charge, spin, lattice, and orbital degrees of freedom leads
to a wide range of emergent phenomena in strongly correlated systems. In
heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e systems, recent
observations of Mott insulators and generalized Wigner crystals are well
described by triangular lattice single-orbital Hubbard models based on K-valley
derived moir\'e bands. Richer phase diagrams, mapped onto multi-orbital Hubbard
models, are possible with hexagonal lattices in $\Gamma$-valley derived moir\'e
bands and additional layer degrees of freedom. Here we report the tunable
interaction between strongly correlated hole states hosted by $\Gamma$- and
K-derived moir\'e bands in a monolayer MoSe$_2$ / natural WSe$_2$ bilayer
device. To precisely probe the nature of the correlated states, we optically
characterise the behaviour of exciton-polarons and distinguish the layer and
valley degrees of freedom. We find that the honeycomb $\Gamma$-band gives rise
to a charge-transfer insulator described by a two-orbital Hubbard model with
inequivalent $\Gamma_\mathrm{A}$ and $\Gamma_\mathrm{B}$ orbitals. With an
out-of-plane electric field, we re-order the $\Gamma_\mathrm{B}$- and K-derived
bands energetically, driving an abrupt redistribution of carriers to the
layer-polarized K orbital where new correlated states are observed. Finally, by
fine-tuning the band-alignment, we obtain degeneracy of the $\Gamma_\mathrm{B}$
and K orbitals at the Fermi level. In this critical condition, stable Wigner
crystals with carriers distributed across the two orbitals are observed until
the Fermi-level reaches one hole per lattice site, whereupon the system
collapses into a filled $\Gamma_\mathrm{B}$ orbital. Our results establish a
platform to investigate the interplay of charge, spin, lattice, and layer
geometry in multi-orbital Hubbard model Hamiltonians.

We present a finite element toolbox for the computation of Bogoliubov-de
Gennes modes used to assess the linear stability of stationary solutions of the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. Applications concern one (single GP equation)
or two-component (a system of coupled GP equations) Bose-Einstein condensates
in one, two and three dimensions of space. An implementation using the free
software FreeFem++ is distributed with this paper. For the computation of the
GP stationary (complex or real) solutions we use a Newton algorithm coupled
with a continuation method exploring the parameter space (the chemical
potential or the interaction constant). Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are then
solved using dedicated libraries for the associated eigenvalue problem. Mesh
adaptivity is proved to considerably reduce the computational time for cases
implying complex vortex states. Programs are validated through comparisons with
known theoretical results for simple cases and numerical results reported in
the literature.

<h3>Implicit Chain Particle Model for Polymer Grafted Nanoparticles</h3>

Matrix-free nanocomposites made from polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGN)
represent a paradigm shift in materials science because they greatly improve
nanoparticle dispersion and offer greater tunability over rheological and
mechanical properties in comparison to neat polymers. Utilizing the full
potential of PGNs requires a deeper understanding of how polymer graft length,
density, and chemistry influence interfacial interactions between particles.
There has been great progress in describing these effects with molecular
dynamics (MD). However, the limitations of the length and time scales of MD
make it prohibitively costly to study systems involving more than a few PGNs.
Here, we address some of these challenges by proposing a new modeling paradigm
for PGNs using a strain-energy mapping framework involving potential of mean
force (PMF) calculations. In this approach, each nanoparticle is coarse-grained
into a representative particle with chains treated implicitly, namely, the
implicit chain particle model (ICPM). Using a chemistry-specific CG-MD model of
PMMA as a testbed, we derive the effective interaction between particles
arranged in a closed-packed lattice configuration by matching bulk
dilation/compression strain energy densities. The strain-rate dependence of the
mechanical work in ICPM is also discussed. Overall, the ICPM model increases
the computational speed by approximately 5-6 orders of magnitude compared to
the CG-MD models. This novel framework is foundational for particle-based
simulations of PGNs and their blends and accelerates the understanding and
predictions of emergent properties of PGN materials.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we used a theoretical measure known as distance between the
states, $\mathcal{E}(\rho_e)$, to determine the bipartite entanglement of a one
dimensional magnetic dimer system. The calculation was compared with the
well-known entanglement measure, concurrence, and found to be the same.
$\mathcal{E}(\rho_e)$ was, then, expressed in terms of two thermodynamic
quantities, namely, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Experimental
verification of temperature variation of the bipartite entanglement measure in
terms of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat was done on single crystals
of copper acetate-an excellent one dimensional dimer system. The results showed
the existence of bipartite entanglement till temperatures as high as room
temperature! Large sized single crystals of copper acetate were grown by a new
evaporation technique and characterised by TGA, IR and Raman spectroscopy
measurements.Density functional theory calculations were done to calculate the
delocalisation index which showed much lower values of $\delta(Cu,Cu)$ than
other bonds, implying that the probability of direct Cu-Cu exchange in copper
acetate is very small.

Two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity in artificial interfaces and
atomic-thin layers has gained attention for its exotic quantum phenomena and
practical applications. Although bulk van der Waals layered materials have been
explored for 2D superconductivity, most of these compounds do not exhibit
remarkable properties despite exhibiting 2D characteristics. Here we report a
comprehensive analysis of single crystals of Li intercalated 2H-TaS$_2$
superconductor, suggesting weakly coupled anisotropic superconductivity.
Angle-dependent magnetotransport and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition confirm quasi-2D superconductivity in 2H-Li$_x$TaS$_2$.

Ghost vortices constitute an elusive class of topological excitations in
quantum fluids since the relevant phase singularities fall within regions where
the superfluid density is almost zero. Here we present a platform that allows
for the controlled generation and observation of such vortices. Upon rotating
an imbalanced mixture of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), one
can obtain necklaces of real vortices in the majority component whose cores get
filled by particles from the minority one. The wavefunction describing the
state of the latter is shown to harbour a number of ghost vortices which are
crucial to support the overall dynamics of the mixture. Their arrangement
typically mirrors that of their real counterpart, hence resulting in a ``dual"
ghost-vortex necklace, whose properties are thoroughly investigated in the
present paper. We also present a viable experimental protocol for the direct
observation of ghost vortices in a ${}^{23}\mathrm{Na}$ $+$ ${}^{39}\mathrm{K}$
ultracold mixture. Quenching the inter-component scattering length, some atoms
are expelled from the vortex cores and, while diffusing, swirl around
unpopulated phase singularities, thus turning them directly observable.

<h3>Asymptotic Quantum Many-Body Scars</h3>

We consider a quantum lattice spin model featuring exact quasiparticle towers
of eigenstates with low entanglement at finite size, known as quantum many-body
scars (QMBS). We show that the states in the neighboring part of the energy
spectrum can be superposed to construct entire families of low-entanglement
states whose energy variance decreases asymptotically to zero as the lattice
size is increased. As a consequence, they have a relaxation time that diverges
in the thermodynamic limit, and therefore exhibit the typical behavior of exact
QMBS although they are not exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian for any finite
size. We refer to such states as \textit{asymptotic} QMBS. These states are
orthogonal to any exact QMBS at any finite size, and their existence shows that
the presence of an exact QMBS leaves important signatures of non-thermalness in
the rest of the spectrum; therefore, QMBS-like phenomena can hide in what is
typically considered the thermal part of the spectrum. We support our study
using numerical simulations in the spin-1 XY model, a paradigmatic model for
QMBS, and we conclude by presenting a weak perturbation of the model that
destroys the exact QMBS while keeping the asymptotic QMBS.

Using circularly-polarized light to control quantum matter is a highly
intriguing topic in physics, chemistry and biology. Previous studies have
demonstrated helicity-dependent optical control of spatial chirality and
magnetization $M$. The former is central for asymmetric synthesis in chemistry
and homochirality in bio-molecules, while the latter is of great interest for
ferromagnetic spintronics. In this paper, we report the surprising observation
of helicity-dependent optical control of fully-compensated antiferromagnetic
(AFM) order in 2D even-layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, a topological Axion insulator
with neither chirality nor $M$. We further demonstrate helicity-dependent
optical creation of AFM domain walls by double induction beams and the direct
reversal of AFM domains by ultrafast pulses. The control and reversal of AFM
domains and domain walls by light helicity have never been achieved in any
fully-compensated AFM. To understand this optical control, we study a novel
type of circular dichroism (CD) proportional to the AFM order, which only
appears in reflection but is absent in transmission. We show that the optical
control and CD both arise from the optical Axion electrodynamics, which can be
visualized as a Berry curvature real space dipole. Our Axion induction provides
the possibility to optically control a family of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFMs
such as Cr$_2$O$_3$, CrI$_3$ and possibly novel states in cuprates. In
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, this further opens the door for optical writing of
dissipationless circuit formed by topological edge states.

MX monopnictide compounds (M=Nb,Ta, X = As,P) are prototypical
three-dimensional Weyl semimetals (WSMs) that have been shown in bulk single
crystal form to have potential for a wide variety of novel devices due to
topologically protected band structures and high mobilities. However, very
little is known about thin film synthesis, which is essential to enable device
applications. We synthesize TaAs(001) epilayers by molecular beam epitaxy on
GaAs(001) and provide an experimental phase diagram illustrating conditions for
single phase, single-crystal-like growth. We investigate the relationship
between nanoscale defects and electronic structure, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, Kelvin probe microscopy and transmission electron
microscopy. Our results provide a roadmap and platform for developing 3D WSMs
for device applications.

Geometrical frustration, as in pyrochlore lattices made of corner-sharing
tetrahedra, precludes the onset of conventional magnetic ordering, enabling the
stabilization of fluctuating spin states at low temperature. Disorder is a
subtle ingredient that can modify the nature of these exotic non-ordered
phases. Here, we study the interplay between disorder and magnetic frustration
in the new pyrochlore Tb$_{2}$ScNbO$_{7}$ where the non magnetic site presents
a charge disorder Nb$^{5+}$/Sc$^{3+}$. Its quantification with sophisticated
diffraction techniques (electrons, X-rays, neutrons) allows us to estimate the
distribution of the splitting of the magnetic Tb$^{3+}$ non-Kramers ground
state doublets and to compare it with excitations measured in inelastic neutron
scattering. Combining macroscopic and neutron scattering measurements, we show
that a clear spin glass transition at 1 K stems out while retaining strong spin
liquid correlations. Our results suggest that Tb$_{2}$ScNbO$_{7}$ stabilizes
one of the novel disorder induced quantum spin liquid or topological glassy
phases recently proposed theoretically.
