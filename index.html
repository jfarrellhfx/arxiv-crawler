We analyze a well-known experimental work [J. Crossno et al., Science 351,
1058 (2016)] which reported on the failure of the Wiedemann-Franz law in
graphene at $T\sim 10$-$100\,\mathrm{K}$, attributing this failure to the
non-Fermi liquid nature of the Dirac fluid associated with undoped intrinsic
graphene. In spite of serious theoretical efforts, the reported observations
remain unexplained. Our detailed quantitative analysis based on Fermi liquid
considerations, which apply to extrinsic doped graphene, establishes that one
possible explanation for the reported observations is the opening of a gap at
the Dirac point, induced perhaps by the boron nitride substrate. We suggest
that more experiments are necessary to resolve the issue, and we believe that
the experiment may not actually have anything to do with Dirac fluid
hydrodynamics, but relates to finite-temperature low-density bipolar diffusive
transport by electrons and holes in the presence of short- and long-range
disorder, and phonons.

<h3>Spontaneous stable rotation of flocking active swarms</h3>

Cluster rotation discussed in many active matter system, as interpreted by
many existing theoretical models, is transient. Yet in nature there exists
spontaneous stable rotation of cluster in many active swarms such as flocking
worms or sheep. In this paper we present a four-node flexible worm model to
study the collective motion of two-dimensional active worms, and confirm that
there exists a spontaneous stable rotation of clusters synchronized with a
chirality produced by the flexibility under the impetus of the active force.
The angular velocity of such a rotation is found to be generated via a
competition between the individual flexibility, the diffusion coefficient, the
cluster size and the active force. The conclusions well explain the spontaneous
stable rotation of clusters that exists in many flexible active matters, like
worms or sheep, once flocking together.

<h3>Pair dynamics of active force dipoles in an odd-viscous fluid</h3>

We discuss the lateral dynamics of two active force dipoles, which interact
with each other via hydrodynamic interactions in a thin fluid layer that is
active and chiral. The fluid layer is modeled as a two-dimensional (2D)
compressible fluid with an odd viscosity, while the force dipole (representing
an active protein or enzyme) induces a dipolar flow. Taking into account the
momentum decay in the 2D fluid, we obtain analytically the mobility tensor that
depends on the odd viscosity and includes nonreciprocal hydrodynamic
interactions. We find that the particle pair shows spiral behavior due to the
transverse flow induced by the odd viscosity. In the limit of infinitely large
odd viscosity, two types of oscillatory behaviors are seen. One of them can be
understood as arising from closed orbits in dynamical systems, and its circular
trajectories are determined by the ratio between the magnitude of the odd
viscosity and the force dipole. In addition, the phase diagrams of the particle
dipolar angles are obtained numerically. Our findings reveal that the
nonreciprocal response leads to complex dynamics of active particles embedded
in an active fluid with odd viscosity.

<h3>Phase formation in CrFeCoNi nitride thin films</h3>

<i>Smita G. Rao, Boburjon Mukhamedov, Gyula Nagy, Eric N. Tseng, Rui Shu, Robert Boyd, Daniel Primetzhofer, Per O. Å. Persson, Björn Alling, Igor A. Abrikosov, Arnaud le Febvrier, Per Eklund</i>
<br>
<br>
As a single-phase alloy, CrFeCoNi is a face centered cubic (fcc) material
related to the archetypical high-entropy Cantor alloy CrFeCoNiMn. For thin
films, CrFeCoNi of approximately equimolar composition tends to assume an fcc
structure when grown at room temperature by magnetron sputtering. However, the
single-phase solid solution state is typically not achieved for thin films
grown at higher temperatures. The same holds true for Cantor alloy-based
ceramics (nitrides and oxides), where phase formation is extremely sensitive to
process parameters such as the amount of reactive gas. This study combines
theoretical and experimental methods to understand the phase formation in
nitrogen-containing CrFeCoNi thin films. Density functional theory calculations
considering three competing phases (CrN, Fe-Ni and Co) show that the free
energy of mixing, delta G of (CrFeCoNi)1-xNx solid solutions has a maximum at x
= 0.20-0.25, and delta G becomes lower when x less than 0.20, greater than
0.25. Thin films of (CrFeCoNi)1-xNx (x = 0.14-0.41) grown by magnetron
sputtering show stabilization of the metallic fcc when x lesser than or equal
to 0.22 and the stabilization of the NaCl B1 structure when x is greater than
0.33, consistent with the theoretical prediction. In contrast, films with
intermediate amounts of nitrogen (x = 0.22) grown at higher temperatures show
segregation into multiple phases of CrN, Fe-Ni-rich and Co. These results offer
an explanation for the requirement of kinetically limited growth conditions at
low temperature for obtaining single-phase CrFeCoNi Cantor-like
nitrogen-containing thin films and are of importance for understanding the
phase-formation mechanisms in multicomponent ceramics.

<h3>T-linear resistivity, optical conductivity and Planckian transport for a  holographic local quantum critical metal in a periodic potential</h3>

High $T_c$ cuprate strange metals are noted for a DC-resistivity that scales
linearly with $T$ from the onset of superconductivity to the crystal melting
temperature, indicative of a Planckian dissipation life time
$\tau_{\hbar}\simeq\hbar/(k_B T)$. At the same time, the optical conductivity
ceases to be of the Drude form at high temperatures, suggesting a change in
dynamics that surprisingly leaves the $T$-linear DC-resistivity unaffected. We
use the AdS/CFT correspondence that describes strongly coupled, densely
entangled states of matter to study the DC and optical conductivities of the
local quantum critical Gubser-Rocha holographic strange metal in 2+1D in the
presence of a lattice potential, a prime candidate to compare with experiment.
We find that the DC-resistivity is linear in $T$ at low temperatures for a
range of potential strengths and wavevectors, even as it transitions between
different dissipative regimes. At weak lattice potential the optical
conductivity evolves with temperature from a Drude form to a bad metal
characterized by a mid-IR resonance without changing the DC transport, similar
to that seen in cuprate strange metals. This mid-IR peak can be understood as a
consequence of Umklapp hydrodynamics: i.e. hydrodynamic perturbations are Bloch
modes in the presence of a lattice. At strong lattice potential an incoherent
metal is realized where momentum conservation no longer plays a role in
transport. In this regime the thermal diffusivity appears insensitive to the
breaking of translations and can be explained by Planckian dissipation
originating in universal microscopic chaos. The charge diffusivity cannot be
explained this way, though the continuing linear-in-T DC resistivity saturates
to an apparent universal slope, numerically equal to a Planckian rate. We
conjecture that this may originate in chaos properties that differ between
charged and neutral operators.

<h3>Topological Superconductivity Mediated by Skyrmionic Magnons</h3>

Topological superconductors are associated with the appearance of Majorana
bound states, with promising applications in topologically protected quantum
computing. One mechanism to produce topological superconductors is to interface
a conventional superconductor with a noncolinear magnetically ordered state
like a skyrmion. In this work, we instead study a system where a skyrmion
crystal is interfaced with a normal metal. Through interfacial exchange
coupling, spin fluctuations in the skyrmion crystal mediate an effective
electron-electron interaction in the normal metal. We study superconductivity
within a weak-coupling approach, and solve gap equations both close to the
critical temperature and at zero temperature. Special features in the effective
electron-electron interaction due to the noncolinearity of the magnetic ground
state, yield topological superconductivity at the interface.

<h3>Fracton Matter</h3>

<br>

We review a burgeoning field of "fractons" -- a class of models where
quasi-particles are strictly immobile or display restricted mobility that can
be understood through generalized multipolar symmetries and associated
conservation laws. Focusing on just a corner of this fast-growing subject, we
will demonstrate how one class of such theories -- symmetric tensor and
coupled-vector gauge theories surprisingly emerge from familiar elasticity of a
two-dimensional quantum crystal. The disclination and dislocation crystal
defects respectively map onto charges and dipoles of the fracton gauge theory.
This fracton-elasticity duality leads to predictions of fractonic phases and
quantum phase transitions to their descendants, that are duals of the
commensurate crystal, supersolid, smectic, hexatic liquid crystals, as well as
amorphous solids, quasi-crystals and elastic membranes. We show how these dual
gauge theories provide a field theoretic description of quantum melting
transitions through a generalized Higgs mechanism. We demonstrate how they can
be equivalently constructed as gauged models with global multipole symmetries.
We expect extensions of such gauge-elasticity dualities to generalized
elasticity theories provide a route to discovery of new fractonic models and
their potential experimental realizations.

We study the relationship between projected momentum-space spin textures and

<h3>Extracting Quantum Many-body Scarred Eigenstates with Matrix Product  States</h3>

Quantum many-body scarred systems host nonthermal excited eigenstates
immersed in a sea of thermal ones. In cases where exact expressions for these
special eigenstates are not known, it is computationally demanding to
distinguish them from their exponentially many thermal neighbors. We propose a
matrix-product-state (MPS) algorithm, dubbed DMRG-S, to extract such states at
system sizes far beyond the scope of exact diagonalization. Using this
technique, we obtain scarred eigenstates in Rydberg-blockaded chains of up to
80 sites and perform a finite-size scaling study to address the lingering
question of the stability for the N\'eel state revivals in the thermodynamic
limit. Our method also provides a systematic way to obtain exact MPS
representations for scarred eigenstates near the target energy without a priori
knowledge. In particular, we find several new scarred eigenstates with exact
MPS representations in kinetically constrained spin and clock models.

We review all symmetry-allowed spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconducting
(SC) order parameters in graphene ($s$-wave, $d$-wave, $p$-wave, and $f$-wave)
generated by generic onsite, nearest-neighbor (NN), and
next-to-nearest-neighbor (NNN) pairing interactions in a tight-binding model.
For each pairing channel, we calculate both the band structure and the
dependence of the density of states on energy, chemical potential, and on the
pairing strength. In particular, we distinguish between nodal superconducting
states and fully gapped states and study the dependence of gap closing points
on the chemical potential and the superconducting pairing strength. We further
investigate the difference between mono-, bi-, and tri-layer ABC and ABA
graphene, including accounting for the effects of trigonal warping.

<h3>Engineering axion insulator phase in superlattices with inversion  symmetry breaking</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study theoretically the interplay between magnetism and topology in
three-dimensional HgTe/MnTe superlattices stacked along the (001) axis. Our
results show the evolution of the magnetic topological phases with respect to
the magnetic configurations. An axion insulator phase is observed for the
antiferromagnetic order with the out-of-plane N\'eel vector direction below a
critical thickness of MnTe, which is the ground state amongst all magnetic
configurations. Defining $T$ as the time-reversal symmetry, this axion
insulator phase is protected by a magnetic two-fold rotational symmetry
$C_2{\cdot}T$. The axion insulator phase evolves into a trivial insulator as we
increase the thickness of the magnetic layers. By switching the N\'eel vector
direction into the $ab$ plane, the system realizes different antiferromagnetic
topological insulators depending on the thickness of MnTe. These phases feature
gapless surface Dirac cones shifted away from high-symmetry points on surfaces
perpendicular to the N\'eel vector direction of the magnetic layers. In the
presence of ferromagnetism, the system realizes a magnetic Weyl semimetal and a
ferromagnetic semimetal for out-of-plane and in-plane magnetization directions,
respectively. We observe large anomalous Hall conductivity in the presence of
ferromagnetism in the three-dimensional superlattice.

We study the cumulants of the charge distribution of a subregion for
two-dimensional quantum Hall states of bosons and fermions at both integer and
fractional fillings, focusing on subregions with corners. Even cumulants, which
include the variance, satisfy an area law with subleading corrections sensitive
to finer geometric details of the subregion such as corner contributions, while
at the same time probing non-trivial sum rules for general correlation
functions. We perform a systematic study of such corner terms, by a combination
of analytic, numerically exact, and Monte Carlo computations. We also study odd
charge cumulants, for which the area-law term vanishes and distinct corner
contributions appear. The observed shape dependence of the third cumulant shows
nearly universal behavior for integer and fractional Laughlin Hall states in
the lowest Landau level. While these states serve as our main example, many of
our finding are expected to hold in considerable generality. As an
illustration, we discuss properties of gapless Dirac fermions, and more general
conformal field theories.

<h3>Entanglements via Slip-Springs with Soft, Coarse-Grained Models for  Systems Having Explicit Liquid-Vapor Interfaces</h3>

Recent advances in nano-rheology require that new methods and models be
developed to describe the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of
entangled polymeric materials and their interfaces at a molecular level of
detail. In this work we present a Slip-Spring (SLSP) model capable of
describing the dynamics of entangled polymers at interfaces, including explicit
liquid-vapor and liquid-solid interfaces. The highly coarse-grained approach
adopted with this model enables simulation of entire nano-rheological
characterization systems within a particle-level base description. Many-body
dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) non-bonded interactions allow for explicit
liquid-vapor interfaces, and compensating potential within the SLSP model
ensures unbiased descriptions of the shape of the liquid-vapor interface. The
usefulness of the model has been illustrated by studying the deposition of
polymer droplets onto a substrate, where it s shown that the wetting dynamics
is strongly dependent on the degree of entanglement of the polymer. More
generally, the model proposed here provides a foundation for the development of
digital twins of experimentally relevant systems, including a new generation of
nano-rheometers based on nano- or micro-droplet deformation.

<h3>Entanglement Steering in Adaptive Circuits with Feedback</h3>

The intensely studied measurement-induced entanglement phase transition has
become a hallmark of non-unitary quantum many-body dynamics. Usually, such a
transition only shows up at the level of each individual quantum trajectory,
and is absent for the density matrix averaged over measurement outcomes. In
this work, we introduce a class of adaptive random circuit models with feedback
that exhibit transitions in both settings. After each measurement, a unitary
operation is either applied or not depending on the measurement outcome, which
steers the averaged density matrix towards a unique state above a certain
measurement threshold. Interestingly, the transition for the density matrix and
the entanglement transition in the individual quantum trajectory in general
happen at \textit{different} critical measurement rates. We demonstrate that
the former transition belongs to the parity-conserving universality class by an
explicit mapping to a classical branching-annihilating random walk process.

Magnetic diffraction in combination with x-ray detected ferromagnetic
resonance (DFMR) is a powerful technique for performing time-resolved
measurements on individual spin textures. Here, we study the ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) modes of both the conical and field-polarized phases in the
chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Following the identification of the FMR modes at
different temperatures using broadband vector network analyzer FMR, we use DFMR
on the crystalline (001) Bragg peak to reveal the time-dependent spin
configurations of the selected FMR modes. By being able to measure both the
amplitude and phase response of the spin system across the resonance, a
continuous phase advance (of 180$^\circ$) in the conical mode, and a phase lag
(of 180$^\circ$) in the field-polarized mode is found. By performing dynamic
measurements in the conical phase as a function of the linear polarization
angle of the x-rays, i.e., successively probing the dynamics of the moments, we
find an inversion of the dynamics along the conical axis upon inverting the
applied field direction. By allowing for time-resolved measurements of the
phase and amplitude of individual magnetic phases, DFMR opens up new
opportunities for obtaining a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of
chiral magnets.

<h3>Electron and Hole Mobility of SnO2 from Full-Band Electron-Phonon and  Ionized Impurity Scattering Computations</h3>

Mobility is a key parameter for SnO2, which is extensively studied as a
practical transparent oxide n-type semiconductor. In experiments, the mobility
of electrons in bulk SnO2 single crystals varies from 70 to 260 cm2V-1s-1 at
room temperature. Here, we calculate the mobility as limited by electron-phonon
and ionized impurity scattering by coupling the Boltzmann transport equation
with density functional theory electronic structures. The linearized Boltzmann
transport equation is solved numerically beyond the commonly employed constant
relaxation-time approximation by taking into account all energy and momentum
dependencies of the scattering rates. Acoustic deformation potential and polar
optical phonons are considered for electron-phonon scattering, where polar
optical phonon scattering is found to be the main factor which determines the
mobility of both electrons and holes at room temperature. The calculated
phonon-limited electron mobility is found to be 265 cm2V-1s-1, whereas that of
holes is found to be 7.6 cm2V-1s-1. We present the mobility as a function of
the carrier concentration, which shows the upper mobility limit. The large
difference between the mobilities of n-type and p-type SnO2 is a result of the
different effective masses between electrons and holes.

<h3>Two-atom-thin topological crystalline insulators lacking out of plane  inversion symmetry</h3>

A two-dimensional topological crystalline insulator (TCI) with a single unit
cell (u.c.) thickness is demonstrated here. To that end, one first shows that
tetragonal ($C_4$ in-plane) symmetry is not a necessary condition for the
creation of zero-energy metallic surface states on TCI slabs of
finite-thicknesses, because zero-energy states persist even as all the in-plane
rotational symmetries--furnishing topological protection--are completely
removed. In other words, zero-energy levels on the model are not due to (nor
are they protected by) topology. Furthermore, effective twofold energy
degeneracies taking place at few discrete $k-$points away from zero energy in
the bulk Hamiltonian--that are topologically protected--persist at the
u.c.~thickness limit. The chiral nature of the bulk TCI Hamiltonian permits
creating a $2\times 2$ square Hamiltonian, whose topological properties
remarkably hold invariant at both the bulk and at the single u.c.~thickness
limits. The identical topological characterization for bulk and u.c.-thick
phases is further guaranteed by a calculation involving Pfaffians. This way, a
two-atom-thick TCI is deployed hereby, in a demonstration of a topological
phase that holds both in the bulk, and in two dimensions.

Mechanical properties in crystals are strongly correlated to the arrangement
of 1D line defects, termed dislocations. Recently, Dark field X-ray Microscopy
(DFXM) has emerged as a new tool to image and interpret dislocations within
crystals using multidimensional scans. However, the methods required to
reconstruct meaningful dislocation information from high-dimensional DFXM scans
are still nascent and require significant manual oversight (i.e.
\textit{supervision}). In this work, we present a new relatively unsupervised
method that extracts dislocation-specific information (features) from a 3D
dataset ($x$, $y$, $\phi$) using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to represent
the large dataset as an array of 3-component feature vectors for each position,
corresponding to the weak-beam conditions and the strong-beam condition. This
method offers key opportunities to significantly reduce dataset size while
preserving only the crystallographic information that is important for data
reconstruction.

High-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow for a
systematic search for conventional superconductors. With the recent interest in
two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, we used a high-throughput workflow to
screen over 1,000 2D materials in the JARVIS-DFT database and performed
electron-phonon coupling calculations, using the McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula
to calculate the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) for 170 of
them. Of these 170 materials, we identify 34 dynamically stable structures with
transition temperatures above 5 K, including materials such as W$_2$N$_3$,
NbO$_2$, ZrBrO, TiClO, NaSn$_2$S$_4$, Mg$_2$B$_4$C$_2$ and the previously
unreported Mg$_2$B$_4$N$_2$ ($T_c$ = 21.8 K). Finally, we performed experiments
to determine the $T_c$ of selected layered superconductors (2H-NbSe$_2$,
2H-NbS$_2$, ZrSiS, FeSe) and discuss the measured results within the context of
our DFT results. We aim that the outcome of this workflow can guide future
computational and experimental studies of new and emerging 2D superconductors
by providing a roadmap of high-throughput DFT data.

<h3>Sliding induced multiple polarization states in two-dimensional  ferroelectrics</h3>

<br>
When the atomic layers in a non-centrosymmetric van der Waals structure slide
against each other, the interfacial charge transfer results in a reversal of
the structures spontaneous polarization. This phenomenon is known as sliding
ferroelectricity and it is markedly different from conventional ferroelectric
switching mechanisms relying on ion displacement. Here, we present layer
dependence as a new dimension to control sliding ferroelectricity. By
fabricating 3R MoS2 of various thicknesses into dual-gate field-effect
transistors, we obtain anomalous intermediate polarization states in multilayer
3R MoS2. Using results from ab initio density functional theory calculations,
we propose a generalized model to describe the ferroelectric switching process
in multilayer 3R MoS2 and to explain the formation of these intermediate
polarization states. This work reveals the critical roles that layer number and
interlayer dipole coupling play in sliding ferroelectricity and presents a new
strategy for the design of novel sliding ferroelectric devices.

Chiral coupling at the single-quantum level promises to be a remarkable
potential for quantum information processing. Here we propose to achieve a
chiral interaction between a magnon mode in a ferromagnetic sphere and a
superconducting qubit mediated by a one-dimensional coupled-cavity array. When
the qubit is coupled to two lattice sites of the array and each one is encoded
with a tunable phase, we can acquire a directional qubit-magnon interaction via
the quantum interference effect. This work opens up a new route to construct
chiral devices, which are expected to become a building block in quantum
magnonic networks.

<br>
<br>
The electronic properties of Fe-based superconductors are drastically
affected by deformations on their crystal structure introduced by doping and
pressure. Here we study single crystals of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ and reveal that
local crystal deformations such as atomic-scale defects impact the spectral
shape of the electronic core level states of the material. By means of scanning
tunnelling microscopy (STM) we image S-doping induced defects as well as
diluted dumbbell defects associated with Fe vacancies. We have access to the
electronic structure of the samples by means of X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) and show that the spectral shape of the Se core levels can
only be adequately described by considering a principal plus a minor component
of the electronic states. We find this result for both pure and S-doped
samples, irrespective that in the latter case the material presents extra
crystal defects associated to doping with S atoms. We argue that the second
component in our XPS spectra is associated with the ubiquitous dumbbell defects
in FeSe that are known to entail a significant modification of the electronic
clouds of surrounding atoms.

<br>
<br>
The magnetic atom diffusion at the interface between CoMn alloy and MnGa
layer with annealing is studied using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
analysis. We found that the spins in bcc CoMn are coupled parallel to those in
perpendicularly magnetized MnGa layer under the as-grown conditions, while the
post-annealing modulates the interfacial magnetic coupling to antiferromagnetic
in Co. The element-specific hysteresis curves at each absorption edge revealed
the large coercive fields in Mn and Co through the exchange coupling with MnGa.
After the annealing process, the changes of XMCD spectral line shapes are
related to the interfacial reactions promoting the formation of Mn and Co2MnGa
layers, which is deduced from the analysis of transmission electron microscopy.
The interfacial diffusion of Mn atoms modulates the magnetic exchange coupling
between Mn and Co sites and reverses the direction of perpendicular
magnetization.

Symmetry-protected topological phases of matter have challenged our
understanding of condensed matter systems and harbour exotic phenomena
promising to address major technological challenges. Considerable understanding
of these phases of matter has been gained recently by considering additional
protecting symmetries, different types of quasiparticles, and systems out of
equilibrium. Here, we show that symmetries could be enforced not just on full
Hamiltonians, but also on their components. We construct a large class of
previously unidentified multiplicative topological phases of matter
characterized by tensor product Hilbert spaces similar to the Fock space of
multiple particles. To demonstrate our methods, we introduce multiplicative
topological phases of matter based on the foundational Hopf and Chern insulator
phases, the multiplicative Hopf and Chern insulators (MHI and MCI),
respectively. The MHI shows the distinctive properties of the parent phases as
well as non-trivial topology of a child phase. We also comment on a similar
structure in topological superconductors as these multiplicative phases are
protected in part by particle-hole symmetry. The MCI phase realizes
topologically-protected gapless states that do not extend from the valence
bands to the conduction bands for open boundary conditions, which respect the
symmetries protecting topological phase. The band connectivity discovered in
the MCI could serve as a blueprint for potential multiplicative topology with
exotic properties.

<h3>Magnetic Proximity Evoked Colossal Bulk Photovoltaics in Crystalline  Symmetric Layers</h3>

Bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect, a second order nonlinear process that
generates static current under light irradiation, requires centrosymmetric
broken systems as its application platform. In order to realize measurable BPV
photocurrent in spatially centrosymmetric materials, various schemes such as
chemical doping, structural deformation, or electric bias have been developed.
In the current work, we suggest that magnetic proximity effect via van der
Waals interfacial interaction, a contact-free strategy, also breaks the
centrosymmetry and generate large BPV photocurrents. Using the Bi2Te3 quintuple
layer as an exemplary material, we show that magnetic proximity from MnBi2Te4
septuple layers yield finite and tunable shift and injection photocurrents. We
apply group analysis and first-principles calculations to evaluate the
layer-specific shift and injection current generations under linearly polarized
light irradiation. We find that the magnetic injection photoconductivity that
localized on the Bi2Te3 layer can reach over 70*108 A/(V2s), so that a 1D
linear current density on the order of 0.1 mA/nm can be achieved under an
intermediate intensity light. In addition to charge current, we also extend our
discussions into spin BPV current, giving pure photo-generated spin current.
The vertical propagation direction between the charge and spin photocurrents
suggest that they can be used individually in a single material. Compared with
previously reported methods, the magnetic proximity effect via van der Waals
interface does not significantly alter the intrinsic feature of the
centrosymmetric material (e.g., Bi2Te3), and its manipulation can be easily
achieved by the proximate magnetic configurations (of MnBi2Te4), interlayer
distance, and light polarization.

<h3>Tailoring Bulk Photovoltaic Effects in Magnetic Sliding Ferroelectric  Materials</h3>

The bulk photovoltaic effect that is intimately associated with crystalline
symmetry has been extensively studied in various nonmagnetic materials,
especially ferroelectrics with a switchable electric polarization. In order to
further engineer the symmetry, one could resort to spin-polarized systems
possessing an extra magnetic degree of freedom. Here, we investigate the bulk
photovoltaic effect in two-dimensional magnetic sliding ferroelectric (MSFE)
systems, illustrated in VSe2, FeCl2, and CrI3 bilayers. The transition metal
elements in these systems exhibit intrinsic spin polarization, and the stacking
mismatch between the two layers produce a finite out-of-plane electric dipole.
Through symmetry analyses and first-principles calculations, we show that
photoinduced in-plane bulk photovoltaic current can be effectively tuned by
their magnetic order and the out-of-plane dipole moment. The underlying
mechanism is elucidated from the quantum metric dipole distribution in the
reciprocal space. The ease of the fabrication and manipulation of MSFEs
guarantee practical optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Enhanced Spin-Orbit Coupling in a Correlated Metal</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the correlation effects on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a
two-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice by applying the variational Monte
Carlo method. We consider an effective SOC constant $\lambda_{\text{eff}}$ in
the one-body part of the variational wave function and mainly discuss the cases
of the electron number per site $n=1$, that is, quarter filling. We find that
$\lambda_{\text{eff}}$ is proportional to the bare value $\lambda$ and depends
on the electron-electron interactions through $(U'-J')$ in a relatively wide
parameter range in the paramagnetic (PM) phase, where $U'$ is the interorbital
Coulomb interaction and $J'$ is the pair hopping interaction. Increasing the
electron-electron interactions in the PM phase leads to a transition to an
effective one-band state, in which the upper band becomes empty due to the
enhanced $\lambda_{\text{eff}}$. We also construct phase diagrams considering
magnetic order. The carrier doping effect on $\lambda_{\text{eff}}$ is also
investigated. We find that $\lambda_{\text{eff}}$ enhances in a strongly
correlated region around the Mott transition point and it is necessary to
include the correlation effects beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation to
describe the enhanced SOC properly.

<h3>Electronic phase diagram in Te-annealed superconducting  FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ revealed by magnetic susceptibility</h3>

<br>
<br>
Knowledge of the doping (x)-temperature (T) phase diagram of Fe-based
superconductors is crucial in understanding the mechanism of high transition
temperature superconductivity. Here, we measured the Se doping dependence of
the magnetic susceptibility for Te-annealed FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$. Two
characteristic temperatures $T^*_{\chi}$ and $T^{**}_{\chi}$ were observed in
the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility, where the magnetic
susceptibility decreased below T$^{**}_{\chi}$ and tended to increase with
further decreasing temperature below T$^*_{\chi}$. The decrease in magnetic
susceptibility below T$^{**}_{\chi}$ is considered to be due to the opening of
the pseudogap. Whereas the increase in magnetic susceptibility below
T$^*_{\chi}$ is attributed to the increase in the carrier concentration of
electrons. Furthermore, we found the large superconducting fluctuation, which
may be related to BCS-BEC crossover.

<br>
<br>
Long-range effects induce some interesting behavior and considered as a
gateway to understand the non-local behavior in the quantum systems.
Especially, the long-range topological models became a platform for the
realization of new quasi-particles, which are believed to be potential
candidates for the topological qubits. In this work, we consider non-Hermitian
Su-Schriffer-Heeger (SSH) model and discuss the interplay of non-Hermiticity
and long-range effects. We use the approach of momentum space characterization,
critical exponents and curvature renormalization group (CRG) method to
understand the aspects of interplay. The longer-range (finite neighbors) effect
produces higher winding numbers, where we observe a staircase of transitions
among the even-even and odd-odd winding numbers which depends on the number of
interacting neighbors. Here we also highlight the effect of multi-criticality
in the system and show that they belong to a different universality class. The
interplay of long-range (infinite neighbors) effect and non-Hermiticity
produces fractional topological invariants, and we analyze them from the
behavior of pseudo-spin vectors. We also determine the long-range and
short-range limit of the model through universality class of critical
exponents. Our work mainly showcases that how the study of criticality in
topological system is interesting in exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity
and long-range effects.

Superconductivity and the normal-state properties of NbN films can be tuned
in a wide range, supplying a suitable platform to investigate the systematical
evolution of the superconducting performances. Herein, we report the upper
critical field of NbN films in both the vertical ($B\perp$ film) and parallel
($B\parallel$ film) orientations over a wide temperature range. Eight samples
with the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ ranging from 2.5 K to 9.8 K
are studied. Meanwhile, the normal-state resistivity is tuned by more than six
times by changing the conditions of the film growth. It is found that the
magnitudes of the upper critical field in both field directions
($B_{c2}^{\perp}$ and $B_{c2}^{\parallel}$) exceed the paramagnetic limiting
field $B_p$. The temperature dependent $B_{c2}^{\perp}$ can be described by the
extended Werthamer--Helfand--Hohenberg (WHH) model considering the Pauli spin
paramagnetism. Meanwhile, the $B_{c2}^{\parallel}$-$T$ data shows the feature
of two-dimensional superconductivity in the temperature range near $T_c$. The
evolution of the obtained Maki parameter with other parameters, such as the
slope of the upper critical field near $T_c$ and the normal-state resistivity,
are discussed to reveal the characteristics of the Pauli paramagnetic effect in
this system.

Kitaev quantum spin liquid, massively quantum entangled states, is so scarce
in nature that searching for new candidate systems remains a great challenge.
Honeycomb heterostructure could be a promising route to realize and utilize
such an exotic quantum phase by providing additional controllability of
Hamiltonian and device compatibility, respectively. Here, we provide epitaxial
honeycomb oxide thin film Na3Co2SbO6, a candidate of Kitaev quantum spin liquid
proposed recently. Its electronic ground state and derived spin Hamiltonian
from spectroscopies are consistent with the predicted Kitaev model. The
field-dependent magnetic susceptibility shows remarkable scaling collapse,
which can be interpreted as evidence of quantum criticality. Our work lay a
foundation for the potential realization and utilization of Kitaev spin liquid
in quantum technologies.

Van der Waals (vdW) magnets are an ideal platform for tailoring
two-dimensional (2D) magnetism with immense potential for spintronics

the microscopic origin of magnetic order in these antiferromagnetic systems. We
used X-ray photoemission electron microscopy to address the electronic and
magnetic properties of the vdW antiferromagnet FePS3 down to the monolayer. Our
experiments reveal a giant out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of 22 meV per Fe
ion, accompanied by unquenched magnetic orbital moments. Moreover, our
calculations suggest that the Ising magnetism in FePS3 is a visible
manifestation of spin-orbit entanglement of the Fe 3d electron system.

Finding a suitable material for hydrogen storage at ambient atmospheric
conditions is challenging for material scientists and chemists. In this work,
using a first principles based cluster expansion approach, the hydrogen storage
capacity of Ti2AC (A = Al,Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) MAX phase and its
alloys were studied. We found that hydrogen is energetically stable in Ti-A
layers in which the tetrahedral site consisting of one A atom and three Ti
atoms is energetically more favorable for hydrogen adsorption than other sites
in the Ti-A layer. Ti2CuC has the highest hydrogen adsorption energy than other
Ti2AC phases. We find that 83.33% Cu doped Ti2AlxCu1-xC alloy structure is both
energetically and dynamically stable and can store 3.66 wt% hydrogen at ambient
atmospheric conditions, which is higher than both Ti2AlC and Ti2CuC phase.
These findings indicate that the hydrogen capacity of the MAX phase can be
significantly improved by doping an appropriate atom species.

<br>
<br>
Quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS), which is closely correlated with the
quenched disorder, is characterized by the divergence of the dynamical critical
exponent and the presence of activated scaling behavior. Typically such a
quantum phenomenon is rather rare and only observed in extremely low
temperatures. Here we report the experimental observation of a robust QGS in
nitride thin films, NbN, which survives in a rather high temperature range. The
electrical transport propertied were measured under the magnetic field up to 12
T. The field induced superconductor-metal transitions were observed with the
continuously changed transition points with the decrease of temperature. The
dynamical critical exponent based on the conventional power-law scaling reveals
a divergent trend when approaching the the low temperature limit. Moreover, the
temperature and field dependence of sheet resistance can be described by the
activated scaling analysis in the temperature region up to 1.6 K $\leq T \leq$
4.0 K. We argue that the robustness of QGS in the present system originates
from the Pauli paramagnetic effect due to the strong coupling between the
magnetic field and the spin degree of freedom.

Phonons are an ideal platform for realizing stable spinless two-dimensional
(2D) Dirac points because they have a bosonic nature and hard-to-break
time-reversal symmetry. It should be noted that the twofold degenerate nodal
points in the phonon dispersions of almost all reported 2D materials are
misclassified as 'Dirac points' owing to a historical issue. The correct name
for these twofold degenerate nodal points should be 'Weyl' because 2D phononic
systems are essentially spinless and because each twofold degenerate point is
described by a Weyl model in two dimensions. To date, there have been no
reports of fourfold degenerate Dirac point phonons in 2D materials. In this
study, we searched through the entire 80 layer groups (LGs) and discovered that
Dirac phonons can be realized in 7 of the 80 LGs. Moreover, the Dirac points in
the phonon dispersions of 2D materials can be divided into essential and
accidental degenerate points, which appear at high-symmetry points and on
high-symmetry lines, respectively. Guided by symmetry analysis, we identified
the presence of Dirac phonons in several 2D material candidates with six LGs.
This letter offers a method for identifying Dirac phonons in 2D and proposes 2D
material candidates for realizing Dirac phonons.

<br>
<br>
Chemical short-range order (CSRO) is believed to be a key contributor to the
exceptional properties of multicomponent alloys. However, direct validation and
confirmation of CSRO has been highly elusive in most compounds. Recent studies
for equiatomic NiCoCr alloys have shown that thermal treatments (i.e.,
annealing/aging) may facilitate and manipulate CSRO. In this work, by using
molecular simulations, we show that nanomechanical probes, such as
nanoindentation, may be utilized towards further manipulation of CSRO,
providing explicit validation pathways. By using well established interatomic
potentials, we perform hybrid Molecular-Dynamics/Monte-Carlo (MD/MC) at room
temperature to demonstrate that particular dwell nanoindentation protocols can
lead, through thermal MC equilibration, to the reorganization of CSRO under the
indenter tip, to a density-wave stripe pattern (DWO). We characterize the novel
DWO structures, that are directly correlated to incipient SRO but are highly
anisotropic and dependent on local, nanoindentation-induced stress
concentrations, and we show how they deeply originate from the peculiarities of
the interatomic potentials. Furthermore, we show that the DWO patterns
consistently scale up with the incipient plastic zone under the indenter tip,
justifying the observation of the DWO patterning at any experimentally feasible
nanoindentation depth.

We investigate the dynamics of a population-imbalanced two-species fermionic
system trapped in an optical lattice. The paired fermions here can form bosonic
molecules via Feshbach coupling in the presence of an external magnetic field.
It is shown that the natural fluctuations of the condensate fraction is
periodic beyond a threshold Feshbach detuning; and below this threshold value
the condensate shows no oscillation at all. The oscillation frequency vs.
detuning curve is linear in nature. The slope and intercept of this line is
shown to carry important information about the amount of imbalance present in
the system, and also about the nature of the pairing that takes place in the
population-imbalanced system. Most importantly, it can help identifying the
Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) phase as its signature is different from
the other possible phases.

We have grown $^{232}$Th:CaF$_2$ and $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ single crystals for
investigations on the VUV laser-accessible first nuclear excited state of
$^{229}$Th. To reach high doping concentrations despite the extreme scarcity
(and radioactivity) of $^{229}$Th, we have scaled down the crystal volume by a
factor 100 compared to established commercial or scientific growth processes.
We use the vertical gradient freeze method on 3.2 mm diameter seed single
crystals with a 2 mm drilled pocket, filled with a co-precipitated
CaF$_2$:ThF$_4$:PbF$_2$ powder in order to grow single crystals. Concentrations
of $4\cdot10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ have been realized with $^{232}$Th with good
($>$10%) VUV transmission. However, the intrinsic radioactivity of $^{229}$Th
drives radio-induced dissociation during growth and radiation damage after

Li-ion conductivity is one of the essential properties that determine the
performance of cathode materials for Li-ion batteries. Here, using the density
functional theory, we investigate the polaron stability and its effect on the
Li-ion diffusion in layered LiCoO2 with different magnetic orderings. The
localized Co4+ polaron appears in the magnetic configurations and sets the
Li-diffusion barrier of ~0.34 eV. The polaron also migrates in the opposite
direction to the Li-diffusion direction. On the other hand, the polaron does
not form in the non-magnetic structure, and the Li diffusion barrier without
the polaron is 0.21 eV. Although the existence of the polaron increases the
diffusion barrier, the magnetically ordered structures are more energetically
stable during the migration than the non-magnetic case. Thus, our work
advocates the hole polaron migration scenario for Li-ion diffusion. Moreover,
we demonstrate that the strong electron correlation of Co ions plays an
essential role in stabilizing the Co4+ polaron.

Exfoliated magnetic 2D materials provide access to a versatile tuning of
magnetization properties, e.g., by gating and by proximity-induced exchange
interactions with other types of 2D materials. However, the electronic band
structure after exfoliation has not been probed for such materials yet, mostly
due to their photochemical sensitivity. Here, we provide micron-scale
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of the exfoliated intralayer
antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$ above and below the N\'{e}el temperature in comparison
with density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate a significant
splitting of parts of the Mn 3d$_{z^2}$-bands induced by the antiferromagnetic
ordering. Related changes of adjacent S 3p-bands indicate a competing
contribution of a ferromagnetic superexchange. The novel access to the
electronic band structure is likely transferable to other MPX$_3$ materials (M:
transition metal, P: phosphorus, X: chalcogenide) that provide a multitude of
antiferromagnetic arrangements.

We study the heat transfer between two nanoparticles held at different
temperatures that interact through nonreciprocal forces, by combining molecular
dynamics simulations with stochastic thermodynamics. Our simulations reveal
that it is possible to construct nano refrigerators that generate a net heat
transfer from a cold to a hot reservoir at the expense of power exerted by the
nonreciprocal forces. Applying concepts from stochastic thermodynamics to a
minimal under-damped Langevin model, we derive exact analytical expressions
predictions for the fluctuations of work, heat, and efficiency, which reproduce
thermodynamic quantities extracted from the molecular dynamics simulations. The
theory only involves a single unknown parameter, namely an effective friction
coefficient, which we estimate fitting the results of the molecular dynamics
simulation to our theoretical predictions. Using this framework, we also
establish design principles which identify the minimal amount of entropy
production that is needed to achieve a certain amount of uncertainty in the
power fluctuations of our nano refrigerator. Taken together, our results shed
light on how the direction and fluctuations of heat flows in natural and
artificial nano machines can be accurately quantified and controlled by using
nonreciprocal forces.

The $\textit{Transformer architecture}$ has become the state-of-art model for
natural language processing tasks, avoiding recurrent and convolutional
structures. Its key feature is the ability to describe long-range correlations
among the elements of the input sequences. This approach has also been adapted
to computer vision tasks, thus defining the $\textit{Vision Transformer}$ (ViT)
architecture, obtaining competitive results compared to state-of-art deep
Convolutional-Neural Networks. Motivated by these achievements, we propose an
adaptation of the ViT architecture with complex parameters to define a new
class of variational neural-network states for quantum many-body systems, the
$\textit{ViT wave function}$. We apply this idea to the one-dimensional
$J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, demonstrating that a relatively simple
parametrization gets excellent results for both gapped and gapless phases. In
particular, the ViT state accurately describes exponentially decaying spin-spin
correlations and the emergence of dimer order in the former case, as well as
long-range spin-spin correlations within the latter one. The success of the ViT
wave function relies on mixing both local and global operations, thus enabling
the study of large systems with high accuracy.

The notion of strong electronic correlations arose in the context of
$d$-metal oxides such as NiO but can be exemplified on systems as simple as the
H$_2$ molecule. Here we shed light on correlation effects on B$_6^{2-}$
clusters as found in $M$B$_6$ hexaborides and show that the B 2$p$ valence
electrons are fairly correlated. B$_6$-octahedron excitation energies computed
for CaB$_6$ and YbB$_6$ agree with peak positions found by resonant inelastic
x-ray scattering, providing a compelling picture for the latter. Our findings
characterize these materials as very peculiar $p$-electron correlated systems
and call for more involved many-body investigations within the whole hexaboride
family, both alkaline- and rare-earth compounds, not only for $N$- but also
($N\pm1$)-states defining e. g. band gaps.

Understanding strongly correlated quantum materials, such as high
$T_\textrm{c}$ superconductors, iron-based superconductors, and twisted bilayer
graphene systems, remains to be one of the outstanding challenges in condensed
matter physics. Quantum simulation with ultra-cold atoms in particular optical
lattices, which provides orbital degrees of freedom, is a powerful tool to
contribute new insights to this endeavor. Here, we report the experimental
realization of an unconventional Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms
populating degenerate $p$-orbitals in a triangular optical lattice, exhibiting
remarkably long coherence times. Using time-of-flight spectroscopy, we observe
a novel nematic superfluid phase associated with spontaneous rotational
symmetry breaking, whose momentum spectrum agrees with the theoretically
predicted coexistence of exotic stripe and loop current orders. In spite of the
markedly different energy scale and the bosonic quantum statistics, the
realized novel quantum state exhibits a similarity with the intertwined orders
in high-$T_\textrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors, twisted bilayer graphene, and
the recently discovered chiral density-wave state in kagome superconductors
$\textrm{AV}_3 \textrm{Sb}_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs). This could contribute to a better
understanding of the underlying physics in these quantum materials.

The transport of particles across lipid-bilayer membranes is important for
biological cells to exchange information and material with their environment.
Large particles often get wrapped by membranes, a process which has been
intensively investigated in the case of hard particles. However, many particles
in vivo and in vitro are deformable, e.g., vesicles, filamentous viruses,
macromolecular condensates, polymer-grafted nanoparticles, and microgels.
Vesicles may serve as a generic model system for deformable particles. Here, we
study non-spherical vesicles with various sizes, shapes, and elastic properties
at initially planar lipid-bilayer membranes. Using the Helfrich Hamiltonian,
triangulated membranes, and energy minimization, we predict the interplay of
vesicle shapes and wrapping states. Increasing particle softness enhances the
stability of shallow-wrapped and deep-wrapped states over non-wrapped and
complete-wrapped states. The free membrane mediates an interaction between
partial-wrapped vesicles. For the pair interaction between deep-wrapped
vesicles, we predict repulsion. For shallow-wrapped vesicles, we predict
attraction for tip-to-tip orientation and repulsion for side-by-side
orientation. Our predictions may guide the design and fabrication of deformable
particles for efficient use in medical applications, such as targeted drug
delivery.

Anomalous global symmetries, which can be realized on the boundary of
symmetry-protected topological phases, brings new phases and phase transitions
to condensed matter physics. In this work, we study a one dimensional model
with an anomalous Z2 symmetry, using the density-matrix renormalization group
method. Besides a symmetry-breaking ferromagnetic phase, we find a gapless
phase described by the SU(2)_1 conformal field theory, despite the existence of
only discrete Z_2 symmetry in the Hamiltonian. The phase transition between the
ferromagnetic phase and the gapless phase is continuous and has the same
critical scaling as in the gapless phase. Our numerical finding is compatible
of theoretical constraints on possible phases resulting from the symmetry
anomaly.

<h3>Quantum phase slips in a resonant Josephson junction</h3>

<i>Tereza Vakhtel, Bernard van Heck</i>
<br>

We investigate the consequences of resonant tunneling of Cooper pairs on the
quantum phase slips occurring in a Josephson junction. The amplitude for
quantum tunneling under the Josephson potential barrier is modified by the
Landau-Zener amplitude to excite an Andreev bound state, resulting in the
suppression of $2\pi$ phase slips. As a consequence, close to resonance, $4\pi$
phase slips become the dominant tunneling process. We illustrate this crossover
by determining the energy spectrum of a transmon circuit, showing that a
residual charge dispersion persists even at perfect transparency.

<h3>Phononic Stiefel-Whitney topology with corner vibrational modes in  two-dimensional Xenes and ligand-functionalized derivatives</h3>

Two-dimensional (2D) Stiefel-Whitney (SW) insulator is a fragile topological
state characterized by the second SW class in the presence of space-time
inversion symmetry. So far, SWIs have been proposed in several electronic
materials but seldom in phononic systems. Here we recognize that a large class
of 2D buckled honeycomb crystals termed Xenes and their ligand-functionalized
derivatives realize the nontrivial phononic SW topology. The phononic SWIs are
identified by a nonzero second SW number $w_2=1$, associated with gaped edge
states and robust topological corner modes. Despite the versatility of
electronic topological properties in these materials, the nontrivial phononic
SW topology is mainly attributed to the double band inversion between in-plane
acoustic and out-of-plane optical bands with opposite parities due to the
structural buckling of the honeycomb lattice. Our findings not only reveal an
overlooked phononic topological property of 2D Xene-related materials, but also
afford abundant readily synthesizable material candidates with simple phononic
spectra for further experimental studies of phononic SW topology physics.

We apply continuous similarity transformations (CSTs) to the easy-axis
antiferromagnetic XXZ-model on the square lattice. The CST flow equations are
truncated in momentum space by the scaling dimension $d$ so that all
contributions with $d\le 2$ are taken into account. The resulting quartic
magnon-conserving effective Hamiltonian is analyzed in the zero-, one-, and
two-magnon sector. In this way, a quantitative description of the ground-state
energy, the one-magnon dispersion and its gap as well as of two-magnon bound
states is gained for anisotropies ranging from the gapped Ising model to the
gapless Heisenberg model. We discuss the critical properties of the gap closing
as well as the evolution of the one-magnon roton mininum. The excitation
energies of two-magnon bound states are calculated and their decay into the
two-magnon continuum is determined via the inverse participation ratio.

Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stabilized quasi-particles and are
promising candidates for energy-efficient applications, such as storage but
also logic and sensing. Here we present a new concept for a multi-turn
sensor-counter device based on skyrmions, where the number of sensed rotations
is encoded in the number of nucleated skyrmions. The skyrmion-boundary force in
the confined geometry of the device in combination with the topology-dependent
dynamics leads to the effect of automotion for certain geometries. For our
case, we describe and investigate this effect with micromagnetic simulations
and the coarse-grained Thiele equation in a triangular geometry with an
attached reservoir as part of the sensor-counter device.

<h3>Simulations with machine learning potentials identify the ion conduction  mechanism mediating non-Arrhenius behavior in LGPS</h3>

Li$_{10}$Ge(PS$_6$)$_2$ (LGPS) is a highly concentrated solid electrolyte, in
which Coulombic repulsion between neighboring cations is hypothesized as the
underlying reason for concerted ion hopping, a mechanism common among
superionic conductors such as Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$ (LLZO) and
Li$_{1.3}$Al$_{0.3}$Ti$_{1.7}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ (LATP). While first principles
simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) provide insight into the Li$^+$
transport mechanism, historically, there has been a gap in the temperature
ranges studied in simulations and experiments. Here, we used a neural network
(NN) potential trained on density functional theory (DFT) simulations, to run
up to 40-nanosecond long MD simulations at DFT-like accuracy to characterize
the ion conduction mechanisms across a range of temperatures that includes
previous simulations and experimental studies. We have confirmed a Li$^+$
sublattice phase transition in LGPS around 400 K, below which the
\textit{ab}-plane diffusivity $D^*_{ab}$ is drastically reduced. Concomitant
with the sublattice phase transition near 400 K, there is less cation-cation
(cross) correlation, as characterized by Haven ratios closer to 1, and the
vibrations in the system are more harmonic at lower temperature. Intuitively,
at high temperature, the collection of vibrational modes may be sufficient to
drive concerted ion hops. However, near room temperature, the vibrational modes
available may be insufficient to overcome electrostatic repulsion, thus
resulting in less correlated ion motion and comparatively slower ion
conduction. Such phenomena of a sublattice phase transition, below which
concerted hopping plays a less significant role, may be extended to other
highly concentrated solid electrolytes such as LLZO and LATP.

<h3>4H-SiC Schottky diode radiation hardness assessment by IBIC microscopy</h3>

We report findings on the Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) characterization of
a 4H-SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD), in terms of the modification of the
Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) distribution induced by 20 MeV C ions
irradiations with fluences ranging from 20 to 200 ions/um2. The lateral IBIC
microscopy with 4 MeV protons over the SBD cross section, carried out on the
pristine diode evidenced the widening of the depletion layer extension as
function of the applied bias and allowed the measurement of the minority
carrier diffusion lengths. After the irradiation with C ions, lateral IBIC
showed a significant modification of the CCE distribution, with a progressive
shrinkage of the depletion layer as the fluence of the damaging C ions
increases. A simple electrostatic model ruled out that the shrinkage is due to
the implanted charge and ascribed the perturbation of the electrostatic
landscape to radiation-induced defects with positive charge state.

Topological defects play a key role in nonequilibrium phase transitions,
ranging from birth of the early universe to quantum critical behavior of
ultracold atoms. In solids, transient defects are known to generate a variety
of hidden orders not accessible in equilibrium, but how defects are formed at
the nanometer lengthscale and femtosecond timescale remains unknown. Here, we
employ an intense laser pulse to create topological defects in a 2D charge
density wave, and track their morphology and dynamics with ultrafast electron
diffraction. Leveraging its high temporal resolution and sensitivity in
detecting weak diffuse signals, we discover a dual-stage growth of 1D domain
walls within 1 ps, a process not dictated by the order parameter amplitude but
instead mediated by a nonthermal population of longitudinal optical phonons.
Our work provides a framework for ultrafast engineering of topological defects
based on selective excitation of collective modes, opening new avenues for
dynamical control of nonequilibrium phases in correlated materials.

Cooper pairs occupy the ground state of typical s-wave superconductors and
are composed of maximally entangled electrons with opposite spin. In order to
study the spin and entanglement properties of these electrons, one must
separate them spatially via a process known as Cooper pair splitting (CPS).
Here we provide the first demonstration of CPS in a semiconductor
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). By coupling two quantum dots to a
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid region we achieve efficient Cooper pair
splitting, and clearly distinguish it from other local and non-local processes.
In the presence of a magnetic field, the dots are operated as spin-filters to
obtain information about the spin of the electrons forming the Cooper pair. Not
only do we demonstrate the splitting of Cooper pairs into opposite-spin
electrons (i.e. singlet pairing), but also into equal-spin electrons, thus
achieving a triplet pairing between the quantum dots. Notably, the
exceptionally strong spin-orbit interaction in our 2DEGs, results in comparable
amplitudes of singlet and triplet pairing. The demonstration of singlet and
triplet CPS in 2DEGs opens the possibility to study on-chip entanglement and
topological superconductivity in the form of artificial Kitaev chains.

Frustrated spin-systems have traditionally proven challenging to understand,
owing to a scarcity of controlled methods for their analyses. By contrast,
under strong magnetic fields, certain aspects of spin systems admit simpler and
universal description in terms of hardcore bosons. The bosonic formalism is
anchored by the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which has
helped explain the behaviors of a wide range of magnetic compounds under
applied magnetic fields. Here, we focus on the interplay between frustration
and externally applied magnetic field to identify instances where the BEC
paradigm is no longer applicable. As a representative example, we consider the
antiferromagnetic $J_1 - J_2 - J_3$ model on the square lattice in the presence
of a uniform external magnetic field, and demonstrate that the
frustration-driven suppression of the N\'{e}el order leads to a Lifshitz
transition for the hardcore bosons. In the vicinity of the Lifshitz point, the
physics becomes unmoored from the BEC paradigm, and the behavior of the system,
both at and below the saturation field, is controlled by a Lifshitz
multicritical point. We obtain the resultant universal scaling behaviors, and
provide strong evidence for the existence of a frustration and magnetic-field
driven correlated bosonic liquid state along the entire phase boundary
separating the N\'{e}el phase from other magnetically ordered states.
