<h3>Steady state correlations and induced trapping of an inertial AOUP particle</h3>

We study the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhnlenbeck particle
self-propelling in a confined harmonic well. The transport behaviour of the
particle is investigated by analyzing the particle trajectories, steady state
correlations, and mean square displacement (MSD). The steady state correlation
functions for the position as well as velocity are exactly calculated using
different methods. We explore how the inertia affects the dynamical behaviour,
when the particle is confined in a harmonic trap as well as when it is set
free. From the exact calculation of MSD, it is observed that the initial time
regimes are ballistic for both harmonically confined particle and free
particle, whereas the long time regimes are diffusive for a free particle and
non diffusive for a harmonically confined particle. One of our interesting
observation is that the harmonically confined particle gets more and more
confined with increase in the self propulsion time or activity time of the
dynamics and finally it gets trapped for very large self propulsion time. For a
free particle, the velocity correlation decays by the complex interplay between
the inertial time scale and the self propulsion time scale of the dynamics.
Moreover, decorrelation in velocity happens only when these two time scales are
of equal order.

We present a formalism for studying the radiation-matter interaction in
multilayered dielectric structures with active semiconductor quantum wells
patterned with an in-plane periodic lattice. The theory is based on the
diagonalization of the generalized Hopfield matrix, and it includes loss
channels in a non-Hermitian formulation. Hybrid elementary excitations named
photonic crystal polaritons arise in these systems, whose detailed dispersion
and loss characteristics are shown to depend on material composition as well as
on symmetry properties of the lattice. We show the generality of the approach
by calculating polariton dispersions in very diverse material platforms, such
as multilayered perovskite-based lattices or inorganic semiconductor
heterostructures. As an application of the method, we show how to engineer
lossless polariton modes through excitonic coupling to bound states in the
continuum at either zero or finite in-plane wavevector, and discuss their
topological properties. Detailed comparison with a semiclassical approach based
on the scattering matrix method is provided, which allows to interpret the
optical spectra in terms of polarization-dependent excitation of the different
polariton branches. This work introduces an efficient and invaluably versatile
numerical approach to engineer photonic crystal polaritons, with potential
applications ranging from low-threshold lasers to symmetry-protected
propagating modes of hybrid radiation-matter states.

Most superconductors have an isotropic, single component order parameter, and
are well described by the BCS theory for superconductivity. Unconventional,
multiple components superconductors are exceptionally rare and are much less
understood. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved
macroscopic transport to study the candidate chiral superconductor,
4Hb-TaS$_2$. We reveal quasi-periodic one-dimensional modulations in the
tunneling conductance accompanied by two-fold symmetric superconducting
critical field. The strong modulation of the in-plane critical field, points to
a nematic, unconventional order parameter. However, the imaged vortex core is
nearly circular symmetric, suggesting an isotropic order parameter. We
reconcile this apparent discrepancy by modeling a competition between a
dominating chiral superconducting order parameter and a nematic one, the latter
emerges close to the normal phase. Our results strongly support the existence
of two-component superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and can provide useful
insights to other systems with coexistent charge order and superconductivity.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14432v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14432v1</a>

<br>

Many-body localisation in disordered systems in one spatial dimension is
typically understood in terms of the existence of an extensive number of
(quasi)-local integrals of motion (LIOMs) which are thought to decay
exponentially with distance and interact only weakly with one another. By
contrast, little is known about the form of the integrals of motion in
disorder-free systems which exhibit localisation. Here, we explicitly compute
the LIOMs for disorder-free localised systems, focusing on the case of a
linearly increasing potential. We show that while in the absence of
interactions, the LIOMs decay faster than exponentially, the addition of
interactions leads to the formation of a spatially extended plateau. We study
how varying the linear slope affects the localisation properties of the LIOMs,
finding that there is a significant finite-size dependence, and present
evidence that adding a weak harmonic potential does not result in typical
many-body localisation phenomenology. By contrast, the addition of disorder has
a qualitatively different effect, dramatically modifying the properties of the
LIOMs. Based on this, we speculate that disorder-free localisation is unlikely
to be stable at long times and for large systems.

<i>Rui Aquino, Nei Lopes, Daniel G. Barci</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we investigate non-Hermitian topological phase transitions using
real-space edge states as a paradigmatic tool. We focus on the simplest
non-Hermitian variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model, including a parameter
that denotes the degree of non-hermiticity of the system. We study the behavior
of the zero energy edge states at the non-trivial topological phases with
integer and semi-integer topological winding number, according to the distance
to the critical point. We obtain that depending on the parameters of the model
the edge states may penetrate into the bulk, as expected in Hermitian
topological phase transitions. We also show that using the topological
characterization of the exceptional points, we can describe the intricate
chiral behavior of the edge states across the whole phase diagram. Moreover, we
characterize the criticality of the model by determining the correlation length
critical exponent, directly from numerical calculations of the penetration
length of the zero modes edge states.

We solve the Dirac equation in three regions of graphene to get the solutions
of the energy spectrum in connection to the strain, energy gap, and magnetic
field. The Goos-H\"anchen shifts and group delay time will be obtained by
applying the stationary phase approximation after the wave functions at the
interfaces have been matched. Our results suggest that the group delay time is
influenced by the presence of strain along the armchair and zigzag directions.
We show that the gate voltage and strain have the ability to change the group
delay from subluminality to superluminality. This may have significant uses in
high-speed graphene-based nanoelectronics.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14342v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14342v1</a>
<br>
<i>Maarten Beens, Koen de Mare, Rembert Duine, Bert Koopmans</i>
<br>
<br>
A `toy model' - aimed at capturing the essential physics - is presented that
jointly describes spin-polarized hot electron transport and spin pumping driven
by local heating. These two processes both contribute to spin-current
generation in laser-excited magnetic heterostructures. The model is used to
compare the two contributions directly. The spin-polarized hot electron current
is modeled as one generation of hot electrons with a spin-dependent excitation
and relaxation scheme. Upon decay, the excess energy of the hot electrons is
transferred to a thermalized electron bath. The elevated electron temperature
leads to an increased rate of electron-magnon scattering processes and yields a
local accumulation of spin. This process is dubbed as spin pumping by local
heating. The built-up spin accumulation is effectively driven out of the
ferromagnetic system by (interfacial) electron transport. Within our model, the
injected spin current is dominated by the contribution resulting from spin
pumping, while the hot electron spin current remains relatively small. We
derive that this observation is related to the ratio between the Fermi
temperature and Curie temperature, and we show what other fundamental
parameters play a role.

<br>
<i>Gianmichele Blasi, Francesco Giazotto, Graldine Haack</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose and theoretically investigate the behavior of a ballistic
Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring when embedded in a N-S two-terminal setup, consisting
of a normal metal (N) and superconducting (S) leads. This device is based on
available current technologie and we show in this work that it constitutes a
promising hybrid quantum thermal device, as quantum heat engine and quantum
thermal rectifier. Remarkably, we evidence the interplay of single-particle
quantum interferences in the AB ring and of the superconducting properties of
the structure to achieve the hybrid operating mode for this quantum device. Its
efficiency as a quantum heat engine reaches $55\%$ of the Carnot efficiency,
and we predict thermal rectification factor attaining $350\%$. These
predictions make this device highly promising for future phase-coherent
caloritronic nanodevices.

Interfacing a topological insulator (TI) with an $s$-wave superconductor (SC)
is a promising material platform that offers the possibility to realize a
topological superconductor through which Majorana-based topologically protected
qubits can be engineered. In our computational study of the prototypical SC/TI
interface between Nb and Bi$_2$Te$_3$, we identify the benefits and possible
bottlenecks of this potential Majorana material platform. Bringing Nb in
contact with the TI film induces charge doping from the SC to the TI, which
shifts the Fermi level into the TI conduction band. For thick TI films, this
results in band bending leading to the population of trivial TI quantum-well
states at the interface. In the superconducting state, we uncover that the
topological surface state experiences a sizable superconducting gap-opening at
the SC/TI interface, which is furthermore robust against fluctuations of the
Fermi energy. We also show that the trivial interface state is only marginally
proximitized, potentially obstructing the realization of Majorana-based qubits
in this material platform.

<br>
<i>Evelina V. Permyakova, Denis S. Goldobin</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the parametric excitation of the free thermal convection in a
horizontal layer and a rectangular cell by random vertical vibrations. The
mathematical formulation we use allows one to explore the cases of heating from
below and above and the low-gravity conditions. The excitation threshold of the
second moments of the current velocity and the temperature perturbations is
derived. The heat flux through the system quantified by the Nusselt number is
reported to be related to the second moment of temperature perturbations;
therefore, the threshold of the stochastic excitation of second moments gives
the threshold for the excitation of the convective heat transfer. Comparison of
the stochastic parametric excitation to the effect of high-frequency periodic
modulation reveals dramatic dissimilarity between the two.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14251v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14251v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a protocol of various low-power dissipation
quantum phenomena and a fundamental precursor of intriguing topological phases
of matter, is usually observed in ferromagnetic materials with orthogonal
configuration between the electric field, magnetization and the Hall current.
Here, based on the symmetry analysis, we find an unconventional AHE induced by
the in-plane magnetic field (IPAHE) via spin-canting effect in $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems, featuring a linear dependence of
magnetic field and 2$\pi$ angle periodicity with a comparable magnitude as
conventional AHE. We demonstrate the key findings in the known AFM Dirac
semimetal CuMnAs and a new kind of AFM heterodimensional VS$_2$-VS superlattice
with a nodal-line Fermi surface and also briefly discuss the experimental
detection. Our work provides an efficient pathway to search and/or design
realistic materials for novel IPAHE that could greatly facilitate their
application in AFM spintronic devices.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14242v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14242v1</a>
<br>
<i>Van-Truong Tran, Thanh-Tra Vu, Philippe Dollfus, Jrme Saint-Martin, Marco Pala</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the thermal transport properties of twisted-layer graphite
nanofibers. We show that in the presence of a twisted layer, the phonon thermal
conductance of a graphite nanofiber varies remarkably with the twisted angle
and can reach minimum values either at two critical angles $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ that conform to the rule $\theta_1$ + $\theta_1$ = $180^0$ or
exactly at the angle $\theta$ = $90^0$. A reduction of roughly 50% of the
phonon thermal conductance can be achieved in some structures. We unveil that
the twisting effect mainly influences the optical modes, leaving almost
unaltered the acoustic ones. The effect is also visible in the higher and more
numerous van Hove singularities of the phonon density of states. We also point
out that the behavior of the thermal conductance with the twisted angle is
associated with and dominated by the alteration in the overlap area between the
twisted and non-twisted layers. The finite-size effect is demonstrated to play
an essential role in defining the critical angles at the local minimums, where
these angles are dependent on the size of the investigated nanofibers, in
particular on the proportion between the widths of zigzag and armchair edges.

We apply the adiabatic approximation to slow thermodynamic processes and
obtain the full counting statistics of work. We identify the change in free
energy and the dissipated work as dynamic-phase-like and geometric-phase-like
quantities. The dynamic phase and geometric phase are directly related to each
other via the fluctuation-dissipation relation.

</body><h3>The study of the dynamics of the order parameter of coupled oscillators in the Ott-Antonsen scheme for generic frequency distributions</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14171v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14171v1</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Campa</i>
<br>
<br>
The Ott-Antonsen ansatz shows that, for certain classes of distribution of
the natural frequencies in systems of $N$ globally coupled Kuramoto
oscillators, the dynamics of the order parameter, in the limit $N\to \infty$,
evolves, under suitable initial conditions, in a manifold of low dimension.
This is not possible when the frequency distribution, continued in the complex
plane, has an essential singularity at infinite; this is the case for example,
of a Gaussian distribution. In this work we propose a simple approximation
scheme that allows to extend also to this case the representation of the
dynamics of the order parameter in a low dimensional manifold. Using as a
working example the Gaussian frequency distribution, we compare the dynamical
evolution of the order parameter of the system of oscillators, obtained by the
numerical integration of the $N$ equations of motion, with the analogous
dynamics in the low dimensional manifold obtained with the application of the
approximation scheme. The results confirm the validity of the approximation.
The method could be employed for general frequency distributions, allowing the
determination of the corresponding phase diagram of the oscillator system.

<br>
<br>
Spin-based applications of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
center in diamonds require efficient spin readout. One approach is the
spin-to-charge conversion (SCC), relying on mapping the spin states onto the
neutral (NV$^0$) and negative (NV$^-$) charge states, followed by a subsequent
charge readout. With high charge-state stability, SCC enables extended
measurement times, increasing precision and minimizing noise in the readout
compared to the commonly used fluorescence detection. Nano-scale sensing
applications, however, require shallow NV centers within a few nm distance from
the surface, where surface-related effects might degrade the NV charge state.
In this article, we investigate the charge state initialization and stability
of single NV centers implanted ~ 5nm below the surface of a flat diamond plate.
We demonstrate the SCC protocol on four shallow NV centers suitable for
nano-scale sensing, obtaining a reduced readout noise of 5--6 times the
spin-projection noise limit. We investigate the general applicability of SCC
for shallow NV centers and observe a correlation between NV charge-state
stability and readout noise. Coating the diamond with glycerol improves both
charge initialization and stability. Our results reveal the influence of the
surface-related charge environment on the NV charge properties and pave the way
towards efficient spin-state readout of shallow NV centers suitable for
nano-scale sensing.

<br>
<i>F. Delgado, J. Fernndez-Rossier</i>
<br>
<br>
A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can probe the inelastic spin
excitations of single magnetic atoms in a surface via spin-flip assisted
tunneling. A particular and intriguing case is the Mn dimer case. We show here
that the existing theories for inelastic transport spectroscopy do not explain
the observed spin transitions when both atoms are equally coupled to the STM
tip and the substrate. The hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spins is shown to
lead to a finite excitation amplitude, but the physical mechanism leading to
the large inelastic signal observed is still unknown. We discuss some other
alternatives that break the symmetry of the system and allows for larger
excitation probabilities.
