<h3>Josephson junction arrays as a platform for topological phases of matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14795" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14795</a>

Two-dimensional arrays of superconductors separated by normal metallic
regions exhibit rich phenomenology and a high degree of controllability. We
establish such systems as platforms for topological phases of matter, and in
particular chiral topological superconductivity. We propose and theoretically
analyze several minimal models for this chiral phase based on commonly
available superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures. The topological
transitions can be adjusted using a time-reversal-symmetry breaking knob, which
can be activated by controlling the phases in the islands, introducing flux
through the system, or applying an in-plane exchange field. We demonstrate
transport signatures of the chiral topological phase that are unlikely to be
mimicked by local non-topological effects. The flexibility and tunability of
our platforms, along with the clear-cut experimental fingerprints, make for a
viable playground for exploring chiral superconductivity in two dimensions.

<br>
A major challenge in the development of quantum technologies is to induce
additional types of ferroic orders into materials that exhibit other useful
quantum properties. Various techniques have been applied to this end, such as
elastically straining, doping, or interfacing a compound with other materials.
Plastic deformation introduces permanent topological defects and large local
strains into a material, which can give rise to qualitatively new
functionality. Here we show via local magnetic imaging that plastic deformation
induces robust magnetism in the quantum paraelectric SrTiO3, in both conducting
and insulating samples. Our analysis indicates that the magnetic order is
localized along dislocation walls and coexists with polar order along the
walls. The magnetic signals can be switched on and off in a controllable manner
with external stress, which demonstrates that plastically deformed SrTiO3 is a
quantum multiferroic. These results establish plastic deformation as a
versatile platform for quantum materials engineering.

<h3>Large anomalous Hall effect in single crystals of the kagome Weyl  ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn</h3>

<br>
<br>
The material class of kagome metals has rapidly grown and has been
established as a field to explore the interplay between electronic topology and
magnetism. In this work, we report a combined theoretical and experimental
study of the anomalous Hall effect of the ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn.
The compound orders magnetically at 725 K and presents an easy-plane
anisotropy. Hall measurements in single crystals below room temperature yield
an anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}\sim500\,(\Omega\textrm{cm})^{-1}$,
which is found to depend weakly on temperature. This value is in good agreement
with the band-intrinsic contribution obtained by density-functional
calculations. Our calculations also yield the correct magnetic anisotropy
energy and predict the existence of Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy.

<h3>Complex dynamics approach to dynamical quantum phase transitions:the  Potts model</h3>

This paper introduces complex dynamics methods to study dynamical quantum
phase transitions in the one- and two-dimensional quantum 3-state Potts model.
The quench involves switching off an infinite transverse field. The
time-dependent Loschmidt echo is evaluated by an exact renormalization group
(RG) transformation in the complex plane where the thermal Boltzmann factor is
along the positive real axis, and the quantum time evolution is along the unit
circle. One of the characteristics of the complex dynamics constituted by
repeated applications of RG is the Julia set, which determines the phase
transitions. We show that special boundary conditions can alter the nature of
the transitions, and verify the claim for the one-dimensional system by
transfer matrix calculations. In two dimensions, there are alternating
symmetry-breaking and restoring transitions, both of which are first-order,
despite the criticality of the Curie point. In addition, there are finer
structures because of the fractal nature of the Julia set. Our approach can be
extended to multi-variable problems, higher dimensions, and approximate RG
transformations expressed as rational functions.

<h3>Probing Inhomogeneous Cuprate Superconductivity by Terahertz Josephson  Echo Spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14849" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14849</a>
<br>
<i>Albert Liu, Danica Pavicevic, Marios H. Michael, Alex G. Salvador, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Michael Fechner, Ankit S. Disa, Pedro M. Lozano, Qiang Li, Genda D. Gu, Eugene Demler, Andrea Cavalleri</i>
<br>
<br>
Inhomogeneities play a crucial role in determining the properties of quantum
materials. Yet methods that can measure these inhomogeneities are few, and
apply to only a fraction of the relevant microscopic phenomena. For example,
the electronic properties of cuprate materials are known to be inhomogeneous
over nanometer length scales, although questions remain about how such disorder
influences supercurrents and their dynamics. Here, two-dimensional terahertz
spectroscopy is used to study interlayer superconducting tunneling in
near-optimally-doped La1.83Sr0.17CuO4. We isolate a 2 THz Josephson echo signal
with which we disentangle intrinsic lifetime broadening from extrinsic
inhomogeneous broadening. We find that the Josephson plasmons are only weakly
inhomogeneously broadened, with an inhomogeneous linewidth that is three times
smaller than their intrinsic lifetime broadening. This extrinsic broadening
remains constant up to 0.7Tc, above which it is overcome by the
thermally-increased lifetime broadening. Crucially, the effects of disorder on
the Josephson plasma resonance are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than
the in-plane variations in the superconducting gap in this compound, which have
been previously documented using Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM)
measurements. Hence, even in the presence of significant disorder in the
superfluid density, the finite frequency interlayer charge fluctuations exhibit
dramatically reduced inhomogeneous broadening. We present a model that relates
disorder in the superfluid density to the observed lifetimes.

<h3>Dominance of extrinsic scattering mechanisms in the orbital Hall effect:  graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and topological antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14878</a>
<br>
<i>Hong Liu, Dimitrie Culcer</i>
<br>
<br>
The theory of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), a transverse flow of orbital
angular momentum in response to an electric field, has concentrated
overwhelmingly on intrinsic mechanisms. Here, using a quantum kinetic
formulation, we determine the full OHE in the presence of short-range disorder
using 2D massive Dirac fermions as a prototype. We find that, in doped systems,
extrinsic effects associated with the Fermi surface (skew scattering and side
jump) provide $\approx 95\%$ of the OHE. This suggests that, at experimentally
relevant transport densities, the OHE is primarily extrinsic.

<h3>Aggregation and structural phase transitions of semiflexible polymer  bundles: a braided circuit topology approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14883" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14883</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas Berx, Alireza Mashaghi</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a braided circuit topology framework for investigating topology
and structural phase transitions in aggregates of semiflexible polymers. In the
conventional approach to circuit topology, which specifically applies to single
isolated folded linear chains, the number and arrangement of contacts within
the circuitry of a folded chain give rise to increasingly complex fold
topologies. Another avenue for achieving complexity is through the interaction
and entanglement of two or more folded linear chains. The braided circuit
topology approach describes the topology of such multiple-chain systems and
offers topological measures such as writhe, complexity, braid length, and
isotopy class. This extension of circuit topology to multichains reveals the
interplay between collapse, aggregation, and entanglement. We show that circuit
topological motif fractions are ideally suited order parameters to characterise
structural phase transitions in entangled systems.

<h3>Inferring phase transitions and critical exponents from limited  observations with Thermodynamic Maps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14885" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14885</a>
<br>
<i>Lukas Herron, Kinjal Mondal, John S. Schneekloth, Pratyush Tiwary</i>
<br>
<br>
Phase transitions are ubiquitous across life, yet hard to quantify and
describe accurately. In this work, we develop an approach for characterizing
generic attributes of phase transitions from very limited observations made
deep within different phases' domains of stability. Our approach is called
Thermodynamic Maps, which combines statistical mechanics and molecular
simulations with score-based generative models. Thermodynamic Maps enable
learning the temperature dependence of arbitrary thermodynamic observables
across a wide range of temperatures. We show its usefulness by calculating
phase transition attributes such as melting temperature, temperature-dependent
heat capacities, and critical exponents. For instance, we demonstrate the
ability of thermodynamic maps to infer the ferromagnetic phase transition of
the Ising model, including temperature-dependent heat capacity and critical
exponents, despite never having seen samples from the transition region. In
addition, we efficiently characterize the temperature-dependent conformational
ensemble and compute melting curves of the two RNA systems GCAA tetraloop and
HIV-TAR, which are notoriously hard to sample due to glassy-like landscapes.

<h3>Dephasing in a crystal-phase defined double quantum dot charge qubit  strongly coupled to a high-impedance resonator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14887" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14887</a>
<br>
<i>Antti Ranni, Subhomoy Haldar, Harald Havir, Sebastian Lehmann, Pasquale Scarlino, Andreas Baumgartner, Christian Schönenberger, Claes Thelander, Kimberly A. Dick, Patrick P. Potts, Ville F. Maisi</i>
<br>
<br>
Dephasing of a charge qubit is usually credited to charge noise in the
environment. Here we show that charge noise may not be the limiting factor for
the qubit coherence. To this end, we study coherence properties of a
crystal-phase defined semiconductor nanowire double quantum dot (DQD) charge
qubit strongly coupled to a high-impedance resonator using radio-frequency (RF)
reflectometry. Response of this hybrid system is measured both at a charge
noise sensitive operation point (with finite DQD detuning) and at an
insensitive point (so-called sweet spot with zero detuning). A theoretical
model based on Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian matches the experimental results
well and yields only a 10 % difference in dephasing rates between the two
cases, despite that the sensitivity to detuning charge noise differs by a
factor of 5. Therefore the charge noise is not the limiting factor for the
coherence in this type of semiconducting nanowire qubits.

<h3>Perturbation theory analysis of the strain-dependent superconducting  phase diagram for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14892" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14892</a>
<br>
<i>John Deisz</i>
<br>
<br>
Previously, it was shown that a superconducting state dominated by singlet
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ intra-band pairs emerges from the fluctuation exchange
approximation (FLEX) applied to a realistic model for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, a result
that is increasingly in alignment with experimental data. Here we apply FLEX to
model the strain-dependent phase diagram of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and show that we are
able to reproduce its unusual features. This adds weight to the argument that a
predominantly $d_{x^2-y^2}$ singlet pairing state represents a reasonable
starting point for describing the superconducting properties of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

<h3>Matbench Discovery -- An evaluation framework for machine learning  crystal stability prediction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14920" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14920</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Matbench Discovery simulates the deployment of machine learning (ML) energy
models in a high-throughput search for stable inorganic crystals. We address
the disconnect between (i) thermodynamic stability and formation energy and
(ii) in-domain vs out-of-distribution performance. Alongside this paper, we
publish a Python package to aid with future model submissions and a growing
online leaderboard with further insights into trade-offs between various
performance metrics. To answer the question which ML methodology performs best
at materials discovery, our initial release explores a variety of models
including random forests, graph neural networks (GNN), one-shot predictors,
iterative Bayesian optimizers and universal interatomic potentials (UIP).
Ranked best-to-worst by their test set F1 score on thermodynamic stability
prediction, we find CHGNet > M3GNet > MACE > ALIGNN > MEGNet > CGCNN > CGCNN+P
> Wrenformer > BOWSR > Voronoi tessellation fingerprints with random forest.
The top 3 models are UIPs, the winning methodology for ML-guided materials
discovery, achieving F1 scores of ~0.6 for crystal stability classification and
discovery acceleration factors (DAF) of up to 5x on the first 10k most stable
predictions compared to dummy selection from our test set. We also highlight a
sharp disconnect between commonly used global regression metrics and more
task-relevant classification metrics. Accurate regressors are susceptible to
unexpectedly high false-positive rates if those accurate predictions lie close
to the decision boundary at 0 eV/atom above the convex hull where most
materials are. Our results highlight the need to focus on classification
metrics that actually correlate with improved stability hit rate.

<br>
<br>
We utilize ultrafast photoexcitation to drive coherent lattice oscillations
in the layered ferrimagnetic crystal Mn3Si2Te6, which significantly stiffen
below the magnetic ordering temperature. We suggest that this is due to an
exchange-mediated contraction of the lattice, stemming from strong
magneto-structural coupling in this material. Additionally, simulations of the
transient incoherent dynamics reveal the importance of spin relaxation channels
mediated by optical and acoustic phonon scattering. Our findings highlight the
importance of spin-lattice coupling in van der Waals magnets and a promising
route for their dynamic optical control through their intertwined electronic,
lattice, and spin degrees of freedom.

<h3>Laser-enhanced magnetism in SmFeO$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The cross-talk between two magnetic ions, Sm$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$, in
samarium ferrite (SmFeO$_3$) leads to a strong interaction of spins and phonons
at low temperatures, while the magnetic interactions are weak. In this work, we
simulate the dissipative spin dynamics in SmFeO$_3$ that are coupled to
laser-driven infrared-active phonons via linear and quadratic modulation of the
exchange energy to coherently enhance spin interactions, referred to as
magnetophononics. When linear coupling dominates, we discover a dynamical
first-order phase transition in the nonequilibrium steady state which can
inhibit strong enhancement of magnetic interactions. By contrast, when
quadratic spin-phonon coupling dominates, no phase transition exists at
experimentally relevant parameters. By utilizing a chirp protocol, we see that
the phase transition can be engineered, enabling stronger magnetic interactions
in the steady state, a key goal of magnetophononics. We also discuss the route
for experimental observation of our results, as well as the potential
application of our theory for functional materials and spintronics.

<h3>Viscoelastic materials are most energy efficient when loaded and  unloaded at equal rates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14955</a>
<br>
<i>Lucien Tsai, Paco Navarro, Elizabeth Mendoza, Emanuel Azizi, Mark Ilton</i>
<br>
<br>
Biological springs can be used in nature for energy conservation and
ultra-fast motion. The loading and unloading rates of elastic materials can
play an important role in determining how the properties of these springs
affect movements. We investigate the mechanical energy efficiency of biological
springs (American bullfrog plantaris tendon) and synthetic elastomers under
symmetric rates (equal loading and unloading durations) and asymmetric rates
(unequal loading and unloading durations) using novel dynamic mechanical
analysis measurements. We find that mechanical efficiency is highest at
symmetric rates and significantly decreases with a larger degree of asymmetry.
A generalized Maxwell model with no fitting parameters captures the
experimental results based on the independently-characterized linear
viscoelastic properties of the materials. The model further shows that a
broader viscoelastic relaxation spectrum enhances the effect of rate-asymmetry
on efficiency. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the interplay
between material properties and unloading dynamics in both biological and
synthetic elastic systems.

<h3>Bose condensation of upper-branch exciton-polaritons in a transferrable  microcavity</h3>

<br>
<i>Xingzhou Chen, Hassan Alnatah, Danqun Mao, Mengyao Xu, Qiaochu Wan, Jonathan Beaumariage, Wei Xie, Hongxing Xu, Zhe-Yu Shi, David Snoke, Zheng Sun, Jian Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Exciton-polaritons are composite bosonic quasiparticles arising from the
strong coupling of excitonic transitions and optical modes. Exciton-polaritons
have triggered wide exploration in the past decades not only due to their rich
quantum phenomena such as superfluidity, superconductivity and quantized
vortices but also due to their potential applications for unconventional
coherent light sources and all-optical control elements. Here, we report the
observation of Bose-Einstein condensation of the upper polariton branch in a
transferrable WS$_2$ monolayer microcavity. Near the condensation threshold, we
observe a nonlinear increase in upper polariton intensity. This sharp increase
in intensity is accompanied by a decrease of the linewidth and an increase of
the upper polariton temporal coherence, all of which are hallmarks of
Bose-Einstein condensation. By simulating the quantum Boltzmann equation, we
show that the upper polariton condensation only occurs for a particular range
of particle density. We can attribute the creation of Bose condensation of the
upper polariton to the following requirements: 1) the upper polariton is more
excitonic than the lower one; 2) there is relatively more pumping in the upper
branch; and 3) the conversion time from the upper to the lower polariton branch
is long compared to the lifetime of the upper polaritons.

<h3>Efficient thermo-spin conversion in van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials has spurred
progress in developing advanced spintronic devices. A central challenge lies in
enhancing the spin-conversion efficiency for building spin-logic or spin-memory
devices. We systematically investigated the anomalous Hall effect and anomalous
Nernst effect in above-room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe with
perpendicular anisotropy, uncovering significant spin-conversion effects. The
anomalous Hall effect demonstrated an efficient electric spin-charge
conversion, with a notable spin Hall angle of 6 $\%$ - 10.38 $\%$. The
temperature-dependent behavior of the anomalous Nernst voltage primarily
results from the thermo-spin conversion. Uniquely, we have experimentally
achieved thermo-spin polarization values of over 690 $\%$ at room temperature
and extremely large of 4690 $\%$ at about 93 K. This study illuminates the
potential of vdW ferromagnets in advancing efficient spin conversion devices.

<h3>Sulfur Vacancy Related Optical Transitions in Graded Alloys of MoxW1-xS2  Monolayers</h3>

Engineering the electronic bandgap is of utmost importance in diverse domains
ranging from information processing and communication technology to sensing and
renewable energy applications. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) provide
an ideal platform for achieving this goal through techniques including
alloying, doping, and creating in-plane or out-of-plane heterostructures. Here,
we report on the synthesis and characterization of atomically controlled
two-dimensional graded alloy of MoxW1-xS2, wherein the center region is Mo rich
and gradually transitions towards a higher concentration of W atoms at the
edges. This unique alloy structure leads to a continuously tunable bandgap,
ranging from 1.85 eV in the center to 1.95 eV at the edges consistent with the
larger band gap of WS2 relative to MoS2. Aberration-corrected high-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy showed the
presence of sulfur monovacancy, VS, whose concentration varied across the
graded MoxW1-xS2 layer as a function of Mo content with the highest value in
the Mo rich center region. Optical spectroscopy measurements supported by ab
initio calculations reveal a doublet electronic state of VS, which was split
due to the spin-orbit interaction, with energy levels close to the conduction
band or deep in the band gap depending on whether the vacancy is surrounded by
W atoms or Mo atoms. This unique electronic configuration of VS in the alloy
gave rise to four spin-allowed optical transitions between the VS levels and
the valence bands. Our work highlights the potential of simultaneous defect and
optical engineering of novel devices based on these 2D monolayers.

<h3>Symmetry-protected flatband condition for Hamiltonians with local  symmetry</h3>

We derive symmetry-based conditions for tight-binding Hamiltonians with
flatbands to have compact localized eigenstates occupying a single unit cell.
The conditions are based on unitary operators commuting with the Hamiltonian
and associated with local symmetries that guarantee compact localized states
and a flatband. We illustrate the conditions for compact localized states and
flatbands with simple Hamiltonians with given symmetries. We also apply these
results to general cases such as the Hamiltonian with long-range hoppings and
higher-dimensional Hamiltonian.

<h3>Tunable tunnel coupling in a double quantum antidot with cotunneling via  localized state</h3>

<br>
<br>
Controlling tunnel coupling between quantum antidots (QADs) in the quantum
Hall (QH) regime is problematic. We propose and demonstrate a scheme for
tunable tunnel coupling between two QADs by utilizing a cotunneling process via
a localized state as a third QAD. The effective tunnel coupling can be tuned by
changing the localized level even with constant nearest-neighbor tunnel
couplings. We systematically study the variation of transport characteristics
in the effectively triple QAD system at the Landau level filling factor $\nu
=2$. The tunable tunnel coupling is clarified by analyzing the anti-crossing of
Coulomb blockade peaks in the charge stability diagram, in agreement with
numerical simulations based on the master equation. The scheme is attractive
for studying coherence and interaction in QH systems.

<h3>Intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator and axion state in  V2WS4</h3>

<br>
<br>
Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators offers an ideal platform to explore
exotic topological phenomena, such as axion electrodynamics, quantum anomalous
Hall (QAH) effect and Majorana edge modes. However, these emerging new physical
effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of
suitable materials. Here, we predict the van der Waals layered V$_2$WS$_4$ and
its related materials show intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer
antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We find extremely rich magnetic
topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological
insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological
magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of
QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films,
respectively. Remarkably, the N\'eel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to
be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. These interesting predictions, if
realized experimentally, could greatly promote the topological quantum physics
research and application.

<br>
<br>
Ternary or more complex hydrogen-rich hydrides are the main hope of reaching
room-temperature superconductivity at high pressures. Their chemical space is
vast and its exploration is challenging. Here we report the investigation of
the La-Mg-H ternary system using the evolutionary algorithm USPEX at pressures
on the range 150-300 GPa. Several ternary superconducting hydrides were found,
including thermodynamically stable $P6/mmm$-LaMg$_{3}$H$_{28}$ with
$T_{\mathrm{C}}=164$~K at 200~GPa, $P/2m$-LaMgH$_8$, $C2/m$-La$_2$MgH$_{12}$
and $P2/m$-La$_3$MgH$_{16}$. In addition, novel binary hydrides were predicted
to be stable at various pressures, such as $Cm$-Mg$_6$H$_{11}$,
$P1$-MgH$_{26}$, $Fmm2$-MgH$_{30}$, $P1$-MgH$_{38}$ and
$R\overline{3}m$-LaH$_{13}$. We also report several novel low-enthalpy
metastable phases, both ternary and binary ones. Finally, we demonstrate
important methods of exploring very large chemical spaces and show how they can
improve crystal structure prediction.

<h3>Quantum phases of the biased two-chain-coupled Bose-Hubbard Ladder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15042</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the quantum phases of bosons in a two-chain-coupled ladder.
This bosonic ladder is generally in a biased configuration, meaning that the
two chains of the ladder can have dramatically different on-site interactions
and potential energies. Adopting the numerical density-matrix
renormalization-group method, we analyze the phase transitions in various
parameter spaces. We find signatures of both insulating-to-superfluid and
superfluid-to-insulating quantum phase transitions as the interchain tunnelling
is increased. Interestingly, tunning the interaction to some intermediate
values, the system can exhibit a reentrant quantum phase transition between
insulating and superfluid phases. We show that for infinite interaction bias,
the model is amenable to some analytical treatments, whose prediction about the
phase boundary is in great agreement with the numerical results. We finally
clarify some critical parameters which separate the system into regimes with
distinct phase behaviours, and briefly compare typical properties of the biased
and unbiased bosonic ladder systems. Our work enriches the Bose-Hubbard
physics.

<br>
The microscopic properties of superconducting cubic skutterudite-like
material Y$_3$Ru$_4$Ge$_{13}$ are investigated using muon spin relaxation and
rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal the
presence of a spontaneous internal field with a magnitude of $\approx$ 0.18~mT
below the superconducting transition temperature, indicating broken
time-reversal symmetry in the ground state. In line with previous experiments,
transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements are consistent with a fully developed
superconductivity gap in Y$_3$Ru$_4$Ge$_{13}$. Our observations point towards
the relevance of electronic correlations beyond electron-phonon coupling as
origin and indicate that spin-orbit coupling is likely not the key driving
force behind the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry in this system.

<h3>Delocalisation enables efficient charge generation in organic  photovoltaics, even with little to no energetic offset</h3>

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are promising candidates for solar-energy
conversion, with device efficiencies continuing to increase. However, the
precise mechanism of how charges separate in OPVs is not well understood
because low dielectric constants produce a strong attraction between the
charges, which they must overcome to separate. Separation has been thought to
require energetic offsets at donor-acceptor interfaces, but recent materials
have enabled efficient charge generation with small offsets, or with none at
all in neat materials. Here, we extend delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC)
to develop a three-dimensional model of charge generation that includes
disorder, delocalisation, and polaron formation in every step from
photoexcitation to charge separation. Our simulations show that delocalisation
dramatically increases charge-generation efficiency, partly by enabling
excitons to dissociate in the bulk. Therefore, charge generation can be
efficient even in devices with little to no energetic offset, including neat
materials. Our findings demonstrate that the underlying quantum-mechanical
effect that improves the charge-separation kinetics is faster and
longer-distance hops between delocalised states, mediated by hybridised states
of exciton and charge-transfer character.

Mixing of two fluids can lead to the formation of precipitation. If one of
the fluids is injected into a confined space filled with the other, a created
precipitate disrupts the flow locally and intricates complex spatiotemporal
patterns. Here, we show that such injection patterns can be controlled
consistently by injection rate and obstacles. Our experimental results revealed
filament patterns for high injection and low reaction rates, and the injection
rate can control the number of active filaments. Furthermore, appropriately
spaced obstacles in the cells can straighten the motion of the advancing tip of
the filament. A mathematical model based on a moving boundary adopting the
effect of precipitation reproduced the phase diagram and the straight motion of
filaments in structured cells.

A five-level M-type scheme in atomic ensembles is proposed to generate a
one-dimensional bipartite superradiance lattice in momentum space. By taking
advantage of this tunable atomic system, we show that various types of
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, including the standard SSH and extended SSH
model, can be realized. Interestingly, it is shown that through changing the
Rabi frequencies and detunings in our proposed scheme, there is a topological
phase transition from topological trivial regime with winding number being 0 to
topological non-trivial regime with winding number being 2. Furthermore, a
robust flat band with higher winding number (being 2) can be achieved in the
above topological non-trivial regime, where the superradiance spectra can be
utilized as a tool for experimental detection. Our proposal would provide a
promising approach to explore new physics, such as fractional topological
phases, in the flat bands with higher topological number.

Microplasmas can be used for a wide range of technological applications and
to improve our understanding of fundamental physics. Scanning electron
microscopy, on the other hand, provides insights into the sample morphology and
chemistry of materials from the mm-down to the nm-scale. Combining both would
provide direct insight into plasma-sample interactions in real-time and at high
spatial resolution. Up till now, very few attempts in this direction have been
made, and significant challenges remain. This work presents a stable direct
current glow discharge microplasma setup built inside a scanning electron
microscope. The experimental setup is capable of real-time in-situ imaging of
the sample evolution during plasma operation and it demonstrates localized
sputtering and sample oxidation. Further, the experimental parameters such as
varying gas mixtures, electrode polarity, and field strength are explored and
experimental $V$-$I$ curves under various conditions are provided. These
results demonstrate the capabilities of this setup in potential investigations
of plasma physics, plasma-surface interactions, and materials science and its
practical applications. The presented setup shows the potential to have several
technological applications, e.g., to locally modify the sample surface (e.g.,
local oxidation and ion implantation for nanotechnology applications) on the
$\mu$m-scale.

<h3>The density of a one-dimensional Bose gas far from an impurity</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider an impurity in a one-dimensional weakly-interacting Bose gas and
analytically calculate the density profile of the Bose gas. Within the
mean-field approximation, by increasing the distance from the impurity, the
Bose gas density saturates exponentially fast to its mean thermodynamic-limit
value at distances beyond the healing length. The effect of quantum
fluctuations drastically changes this behavior, leading to a power law decay of
the density deviation from the mean density. At distances longer than the
healing length and shorter than a new length scale proportional to the impurity
coupling strength, the power-law exponent is $2$, while at longest distances
the corresponding exponent becomes $3$. The latter crossover does not exist in
two special cases. The first one is realized for infinitely strongly coupled
impurity; then the density deviation always decays with the exponent $2$. The
second special case occurs when the new length scale is smaller than the
healing length, i.e., at weak impurity coupling; then the density deviation
always decays with the exponent $3$. The obtained results are exact in the
impurity coupling strength and account for the leading order in the interaction
between the particles of the Bose gas.

<h3>Unraveling the Complexity of Metal Ion Dissolution: Insights from Hybrid  First-Principles/Continuum Calculations</h3>

The study of ion dissolution from metal surfaces has a long-standing history,
wherein the gradual dissolution of solute atoms with increasing electrode
potential, leading to their existence as ions in the electrolyte with integer
charges, is well-known. However, our present work reveals a more intricate and
nuanced physical perspective based on comprehensive first-principles/continuum
calculations. We investigate the dissolution and deposition processes of 22
metal elements across a range of applied electrode potentials, unveiling
diverse dissolution models. By analyzing the energy profiles and valence states
of solute atoms as a function of the distance between the solute atom and metal
surface, we identify three distinct dissolution models for different metals.
Firstly, solute atoms exhibit an integer valence state following an
integer-valence jump, aligning with classical understandings. Secondly, solute
atoms attain an eventual integer valence, yet their valence state increases in
a non-integer manner during dissolution. Lastly, we observe solute atoms
exhibiting a non-integer valence state, challenging classical understandings.
Furthermore, we propose a theoretical criterion for determining the selection
of ion valence during electrode dissolution under applied potential. These
findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the dissolution
process but also offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics governing
metal ion dissolution at the atomic level. Such knowledge has the potential to
advance the design of more efficient electrochemical systems and open new
avenues for controlling dissolution processes in various applications.

Molecular hydrogen is at the core of hydrogen energy applications and has the
potential to significantly reduce the use of carbon dioxide emitting energy
processes. However, hydrogen gas storage is a major bottleneck for its
large-scale use as current storage methods are energy intensive. Among
different storage methods, physisorbing molecular hydrogen at ambient pressure
and temperatures is a promising alternative - particularly thanks to tuneable
lightweight nanomaterials and high throughput screening methods. Nonetheless,
understanding hydrogen adsorption in well-defined nanomaterials remains
experimentally challenging and reference information is scarce despite the
proliferation of works predicting hydrogen adsorption. In this work, we focus
on Li, Na, Ca, and K, decorated graphene sheets as substrates for hydrogen
adsorption and compute the most accurate adsorption energies available to date
using quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). Building on our previous insights at
the density functional theory (DFT) level, we find that a weak covalent
chemisorption of molecular hydrogen, known as Kubas binding, is feasible on Ca
decorated graphene according to DMC, in agreement with DFT. This finding is in
contrast to previous DMC predictions of the 4H$_2$/Ca$^+$ gas cluster where
chemisorption is not favoured. However, we find that the adsorption energy of
hydrogen on metal decorated graphene according to a widely-used DFT method is
not fully consistent with DMC and the discrepancies are not systematic. The
reference adsorption energies reported herein can be used to find better
work-horse methods for application in large-scale modelling of hydrogen
adsorption. Furthermore, the implications of this work affect strategies for
finding suitable hydrogen storage materials and high-throughput methods.

<h3>Non-equilibrium cluster-cluster aggregation in the presence of anchoring  sites</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-equilibrium cluster-cluster aggregation of particles diffusing in or at
the cell membrane has been hypothesized to lead to domains of finite size in
different biological contexts such as lipid rafts, cell adhesion complexes, or
postsynaptic domains in neurons. In this scenario, the desorption of particles
balances a continuous flux to the membrane, imposing a cut-off on possible
aggregate sizes and giving rise to a stationary size distribution. Here, we
investigate the case of non-equilibrium cluster-cluster aggregation in two
dimensions where diffusing particles and/or clusters remain fixed in space at
specific anchoring sites, which should be particularly relevant for synapses
but may also be present in other biological or physical systems. Using an
effective mean-field description of the concentration field around anchored
clusters, we derive an expression for their average size as a function of
parameters such as the anchoring site density. We furthermore propose and solve
appropriate rate equations that allow us to predict the size distributions of
both diffusing and fixed clusters. We confirm our results with particle-based
simulations, and discuss potential implications for biological and physical
systems.

<h3>A semiclassical model for charge transfer along ion chains in silicates</h3>

It has been observed in fossil tracks and experiments in the layered silicate
mica muscovite the transport of charge through the cation layers sandwiched
between the layers of tetrahedra-octahedra-tetrahedra. A classical model for
the propagation of anharmonic vibrations along the cation chains has been
proposed based on first principles and empirical functions. In that model,
several propagating entities have been found as kinks or crowdions and
breathers, both with or without wings, the latter for specific velocities and
energies. Crowdions are equivalent to moving interstitials and transport
electric charge if the moving particle is an ion, but they also imply the
movement of mass, which was not observed in the experiments. Breathers, being
just vibrational entities, do not transport charge. In this work, we present a
semiclassical model obtained by adding a quantum particle, electron or hole to
the previous model. We present the construction of the model based on the
physics of the system. In particular, the strongly nonlinear vibronic
interaction between the nuclei and the extra electron or hole is essential to
explain the localized charge transport, which is not compatible with the
adiabatic approximation. The formation of vibrational localized charge carriers
breaks the lattice symmetry group in a similar fashion to the Jahn-Teller
Effect, providing a new stable dynamical state. We study the properties and the
coherence of the model through numerical simulations from initial conditions
obtained by tail analysis and other means. We observe that although the charge
spreads from an initial localization in a lattice at equilibrium, it can be
confined basically to a single particle when coupled to a chaotic quasiperiodic
breather. This is coherent with the observation that experiments imply that a
population of charge is formed due to the decay of potassium unstable isotopes.

Of the three basic states of matter, liquid is perhaps the most complex.
While its flow properties are described by fluid mechanics, its thermodynamic
properties are often neglected, and for many years it was widely believed that
a general theory of liquid thermodynamics was unattainable. In recent decades
that view has been challenged, as new advances have finally enabled us to
understand and describe the thermodynamic properties of liquids. This book
explains the recent developments in theory, experiment and modelling that have
enabled us to understand the behaviour of excitations in liquids and the impact
of this behaviour on heat capacity and other basic properties. Presented in
plain language with a focus on real liquids and their experimental properties,
this book is a useful reference text for researchers and graduate students in
condensed matter physics and chemistry, as well as for advanced courses
covering the theory of liquids.

<h3>Can stochastic resetting render a heat engine more efficient?</h3>

We explore the thermodynamics of stochastic heat engines in presence of
stochastic resetting. The set-up comprises an engine whose working substance is
a Brownian particle undergoing overdamped Langevin dynamics in a harmonic
potential with a time-dependent stiffness, with the dynamics interrupted at
random times with a resetting to a fixed location. The effect of resetting to
the potential minimum is shown to enhance the efficiency of the engine, while
the output work is shown to have a non-monotonic dependence on the rate of
resetting. The resetting events are found to drive the system out of linear
response regime even for small differences in the bath temperatures. Shifting
the reset point from the potential minimum is observed to reduce the engine
efficiency. The experimental set-up for the realization of such an engine is
briefly discussed.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we theoretically investigate the optical orientation and
alignment of excitons in quantum dots with weak electron-hole exchange
interaction and long exciton radiative lifetimes. This particular regime is
realized in semiconductor heterosystems where excitons are indirect in the
$\boldsymbol r$ or $\boldsymbol k$ space. The main role in the fine structure
of excitonic levels in these systems is played by the hyperfine interaction of
the electron in the confined exciton and fluctuations of the Overhauser field.
Along with it, the effects of nonradiative recombination and exchange
interaction are considered. We start with the model of vanishing exchange
interaction and nonradiative exciton recombination and then include them into
consideration in addition to the strong Overhauser field. In the nanoobjects
under study, the polarization properties of the resonant photoluminescence are
shown to vary with the external magnetic filed in completely different way as
compared with the behaviour of the conventional quantum dot structures.

Ultra-fast single-photon detectors with high current density and operating
temperature can benefit space and ground applications, including quantum
optical communication systems, lightweight cryogenics for space crafts, and
medical use. Here we demonstrate magnesium diboride (MgB$_2$) thin-film
superconducting microwires capable of single-photon detection at 1.55 $\mu$m
optical wavelength. We used helium ions to alter the properties of MgB$_2$,
resulting in microwire-based detectors exhibiting single-photon sensitivity
across a broad temperature range of up to 20 K, and detection efficiency
saturation for 1 $\mu$m wide microwires at 3.7 K. Linearity of detection rate
vs incident power was preserved up to at least ~100 Mcps. Despite the large
active area of up to 400$\times$400 $\mu$m$^2$, the reset time was found to be
as low as $\sim1$ ns. Our research provides new possibilities for breaking the
operating temperature limit and maximum single-pixel count rate, expanding the
detector area, and raises inquiries about the fundamental mechanisms of
single-photon detection in high-critical-temperature superconductors.

<h3>Robust Zeeman-type band splitting in sliding ferroelectrics</h3>

Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit giant spin-orbit coupling, and
intriguing spin-valley effects, which can be harnessed through proximity in van
der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Remarkably, due to the prismatic crystal
field, the Zeeman-type band splitting of valence bands reach values of several
hundreds of meV. While this effect is suppressed in the commonly studied
hexagonal (H)-stacked bilayers due to the presence of inversion symmetry, the
recent discovery of sliding ferroelectricity in rhombohedral (R-)stacked MX$_2$
bilayers (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se) suggests that the Zeeman effect could be present in
these non-centrosymmetric configurations, making it even more intriguing to
investigate how the spin-resolved bands would evolve during the phase
transition. Here, we perform density functional theory calculations
complemented by symmetry analysis to unveil the evolution of ferroelectricity
during sliding and the behavior of Zeeman splitting along the transition path.
While the evolution of the out-of-plane component of the electric polarization
vector resembles the conventional ferroelectric transition, we observe
significant in-plane components parallel to the sliding direction, reaching
their maximum at the intermediate state. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
R-stacked bilayers exhibit persistent Zeeman-type band splitting throughout the
transition path, allowed by the lack of inversion symmetry. Further analysis of
different stacking configurations generated by sliding along various directions
confirms that the Zeeman effect in MX$_2$, primarily arising from the polarity
of prismatic ligand coordination of the metal atom, is remarkably robust and
completely governs the spin polarization of bands, independently of the sliding
direction. This resilience promises robust spin transport in vdW based MX$_2$
bilayers, opening new opportunities for ferroelectric spintronics.

<h3>Enhanced chiral edge currents and orbital magnetic moment in chiral  $d$-wave superconductors from mesoscopic finite-size effects</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chiral superconductors spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and host
topologically protected edge modes, supposedly generating chiral edge currents
which are typically taken as a characteristic fingerprint of chiral
superconductivity. However, recent studies have shown that the total edge
current in two dimensions (2D) often vanishes for all chiral superconductors
except for chiral $p$-wave, especially at low temperatures, thus severely
impeding potential experimental verification and characterization of these
superconductors. In this work, we use quasiclassical theory of
superconductivity to study mesoscopic disc-schaped chiral $d$-wave
superconductors. We find that mesoscopic finite-size effects cause a dramatic
enhancement of the total charge current and orbital magnetic moment (OMM), even
at low temperatures. We study how these quantities scale with temperature,
spontaneous Meissner screening, and system radius $\mathcal{R} \in
[5,200]\xi_0$ with superconducting coherence length $\xi_0$. We find a general
$1/\mathcal{R}$ scaling in the total charge current and OMM for sufficiently
large systems, but this breaks down in small systems, instead producing a local
maximum at $\mathcal{R} \approx 10{\text{--}}20\xi_0$ due to mesoscopic
finite-size effects. These effects also cause a spontaneous charge-current
reversal opposite to the chirality below $\mathcal{R} < 10\xi_0$. Our work
highlights mesoscopic systems as a route to experimentally verify chiral
$d$-wave superconductivity, measurable with magnetometry.

<h3>Multiferroic domain relaxation in (NH4)2[FeCl5(H2O)]</h3>

<br>
<br>
The molecular compound (NH4)2[FeCl5(H2O)] is a type-II multiferroic material,
in which incommensurate cycloidal order directly induces ferroelectric
polarization. The multiferroic domain kinetics in (NH4)2[FeCl5(H2O)] were
studied by time-resolved neutron diffraction experiments utilizing neutron
polarization analysis. The temperature and electric-field dependent
multiferroic relaxation obeys the simple combined Arrhenius-Merz law, which was
reported to describe domain kinetics in the prototype multiferroics TbMnO3 and
NaFeGe2O6. However, the characteristic time scale of the multiferroic
relaxation is considerably larger than those in TbMnO3 or NaFeGe2O6.
Temperature-dependent diffraction on (NH4)2[FeCl5(H2O)] reveals the emergence
of higher-order and commensurate magnetic contributions upon cooling in the
multiferroic phase in zero field. The good agreement with studies of
higher-harmonic contributions in the deuterated material indicates that the
isotopes only posses a minor impact on the magnetic ordering. But in contrast
to similar observations in multiferroic MnWO4, this anharmonic modification of
magnetic ordering does not depin multiferroic domain walls or alter the
temperature dependence of the multiferroic relaxation.

<br>
<br>
We present here a rare example of electronuclear quantum criticality in a
metal. The compound YbCu4.6Au0.4 is located at an unconventional quantum
critical point (QCP). In this material the relevant Kondo and RKKY exchange
interactions are very weak, of the order of 1 K. Furthermore, there is strong
competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic correlations, possibly
due to geometrical frustration within the fcc Yb sublattice. This causes strong
spin fluctuations which prevent the system to order magnetically. Because of
the very low Kondo temperature the Yb3+ 4f-electrons couple weakly with the
conduction electrons allowing the coupling to the nuclear moments of the 171Yb
and 173Yb isotopes to become important. Thus, the quantum critical fluctuations
observed at the QCP do not originate from purely electronic states but from
entangled electronuclear states. This is evidenced by the anomalous temperature
and field dependence of the specific heat at low temperatures.

<br>
The structure of the excess proton in liquid water has been the subject of
lively debate from both experimental and theoretical fronts for the last
century. Fluctuations of the proton are typically interpreted in terms of
limiting states referred to as the Eigen and Zundel species. Here we put these
ideas under the microscope taking advantage of recent advances in unsupervised
learning that use local atomic descriptors to characterize environments of
acidic water combined with advanced clustering techniques. Our agnostic
approach leads to the observation of only a single charged cluster and two
neutral ones. We demonstrate that the charged cluster involving the excess
proton, is best seen as an ionic topological defect in water's hydrogen bond
network forming a single local minimum on the global free-energy landscape.
This charged defect is a highly fluxional moiety where the idealized Eigen and
Zundel species are neither limiting configurations nor distinct thermodynamic
states. Instead, the ionic defect enhances the presence of neutral water
defects through strong interactions with the network. We dub the combination of
the charged and neutral defect clusters as ZundEig demonstrating that the
fluctuations between these local environments provide a general framework for
rationalizing more descriptive notions of the proton in the existing
literature.

We report a detailed study of the magnetic field switching of

Ba$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$Mg$_2$Fe$_{12}$O$_{22}$. By combining data from SQUID
magnetometry, magneto-current measurements, and resonant X-ray scattering
experiments, we arrive at a complete description of the deterministic
switching, which involves the formation of a temperature-dependent mixed state
in low magnetic fields. This mechanism is likely to be shared by other members
of the hexaferrite family, and presents a challenge for the development of
high-speed read-write memory devices based on these materials.

In-plane anomalous Hall effect (IPAHE) is a unconventional anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) with the Hall current flows in the plane spanned by the
magnetization or magnetic field and the electric field. Here, we predict a
stable two-dimensional ferromagnetic monolayer
$\mathrm{Mn}_{3}\mathrm{Si}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{6}$ with collinear ordering of Mn
moments in the basal plane. Moreover, we reveal that the monolayer
$\mathrm{Mn}_{3}\mathrm{Si}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{6}$ possesses a substantial
periodic IPAHE due to the threefold rotational symmetry, which can be switched
by changing the magnetization orientation by external magnetic fields. In
addition, we briefly discuss the impacts of moderate strains on the electronic
states and AHE, which lead to a near quantized Hall conductivity. Our work
provides a potential platform for realizing a sizable and controllable IPAHE
that greatly facilatates the application of energy-efficient spintronic
devices.

We investigate the electronic, structural and topological properties of the
SnTe and PbTe cubic nanowires using ab-initio calculations. Using standard and
linear-scale density functional theory, we go from the ultrathin limit up to
the nanowires thicknesses observed experimentally. Finite-size effects in the
ultra-thin limit produce an electric quadrupole and associated structural
distortions, these distortions increase the band gap but they get reduced with
the size of the nanowires and become less and less relevant. Ultrathin SnTe
cubic nanowires are trivial band gap insulators, we demonstrate that by
increasing the thickness there is an electronic transition to a spin-orbit
insulating phase due to trivial surface states in the regime of thin nanowires.
These trivial surface states with a spin-orbit gap of a few meV appear at the
same k-point of the topological surface states. Going to the limit of thick
nanowires, we should observe the transition to the topological crystalline
insulating phase with the presence of two massive surface Dirac fermions
hybridized with the persisting trivial surface states. Therefore, we have the
co-presence of massive Dirac surface states and trivial surface states close to
the Fermi level in the same region of the k-space. According to our estimation,
the cubic SnTe nanowires are trivial insulators below the critical thickness
tc1=10 nm, and they become spin-orbit insulators between tc1=10 nm and tc2=17
nm, while they transit to the topological phase above the critical thickness of
tc2=17 nm. These critical thickness values are in the range of the typical
experimental thicknesses, making the thickness a relevant parameter for the
synthesis of topological cubic nanowires. Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Te nanowires would have
both these critical thicknesses tc1 and tc2 at larger values depending on the
doping concentration.

We present a theory to realize entangled quantum spin states with fractional
magnetization. The origin of magnetization reduction is partly emergent
antiferromagnetism, that is, spin-liquefaction of ferromagnetism. We study a
ferromagnetic bilinear coupling region of the spin-$S$ $({\geqq} 1)$
bilinear-biquadratic spin chain based on (i) a rigorous eigenstate
correspondence between the spin-$S$ model and spin-$\frac12$ model and (ii) a
numerical exact-diagonalization calculation up to $S=3$. As a result, we obtain
a fractional magnetized $M=1-1/(2S)$ phase, where ground states have quantum
entanglement-reflecting corresponding spin-$\frac12$ antiferromagnetic ground
states in a ferromagnetic background. This spin-liquefaction theory of
ferromagnets can be generalized to any-dimensional lattices even under a
magnetic field. This fractional ferromagnetism opens the new research field of
quantum ferromagnets.

<h3>Revealing quasi-excitations in the low-density homogeneous electron gas  with model exchange-correlation kernels</h3>

Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) within the linear response
regime provides a solid mathematical framework to capture excitations. The
accuracy of the theory, however, largely depends on the approximations for the
exchange-correlation (xc) kernels. Away from the long-wavelength (or $q=0$
short wave-vector) and zero-frequency ($\omega=0$) limit, the correlation
contribution to the kernel becomes more relevant and dominant over exchange.
The dielectric function in principle can encompass xc effects relevant to
describe low-density physics. Furthermore, besides collective plasmon
excitations, the dielectric function can reveal collective electron-hole
excitations, often dubbed ``ghost excitons.'' Beside collective excitons, the
physics in the low-density regime is rich, as exemplified by a static
charge-density wave that was recently found for $r_\mathrm{s} > 69$, and was
shown to be associated with softening of the plasmon mode. In this work we
perform a thorough analysis with xc model kernels for excitations of various
nature. The uniform electron gas as a useful model of real metallic systems is
used as a platform of our analysis. We highlight the relevance of exact
constraints as we display and explain screening and excitations in the
low-density region.

van der Waals (vdW) magnets, an emerging family of two-dimensional (2D)
materials, have received tremendous attention due to their rich fundamental
physics and significant potential for cutting-edge technological applications.
In contrast to the conventional bulk counterparts, vdW magnets exhibit
significant tunability of local material properties, such as stacking
engineered interlayer coupling and layer-number dependent magnetic and
electronic interactions, which promise to deliver previously unavailable merits
to develop multifunctional microelectronic devices. As a further ingredient of
this emerging topic, here we report nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging of
atomically thin vdW magnet chromium thiophosphate CrPS4, revealing its
characteristic layer-dependent 2D static magnetism and dynamic spin
fluctuations. We also show a large tunneling magnetoresistance in CrPS4-based
spin filter vdW heterostructures. The excellent material stability, robust
strategy against environmental degradation, in combination with tailored
magnetic properties highlight the potential of CrPS4 in developing
state-of-the-art 2D spintronic devices for next-generation information
technologies.

Sessile hydrogel drops on rigid surfaces exhibit wetting/contact morphology
intermediate between liquid drops and glass spheres. Using density functional
theory, we reveal the contact forces acting between a hydrogel and a rigid
glass surface. We show that while transitioning from liquid-like to solid-like
hydrogels, there exists a critical hydrogel elasticity which enables a switch
from attractive to repulsive interaction with the underlying rigid glass
surface. Our theoretical model is validated by experimental observations of
sessile Polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels of varying elasticity on glass
surfaces. Further, the proposed model successfully approaches Young's law in
the pure liquid limit and work of adhesion in the glassy limit. Lastly, we show
a modified contact angle relation taking into account the hydrogel elasticity
to explain the features of a distinct hydrogel foot.

Epitaxially-grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide an attractive
platform for the development of deterministic sources of high-quality quantum
states of light. Such non-classical light sources are essential for quantum
information processing and quantum communication. QDs emitting in the telecom
wavelengths are especially important for ensuring compatibility with optical
fiber systems required to implement quantum communication networks. To this
end, GaSb QDs fabricated by filling local-droplet etched nanoholes are emerging
as a viable approach, yet the electronic properties of such nanostructures have
not been studied in detail. In this article, an insight into the electronic
structure and carrier dynamics in GaSb/AlGaSb QDs is provided through a
systematic experimental analysis of their temperature-dependent
photoluminescence behavior. A steady-state rate equation model is used to
reveal the relevant energy barriers for thermally activated carrier capture and
escape processes. Furthermore, results of detailed theoretical simulations of
quantum-confined energy states using the multi-band k.p model and the effective
mass method are presented. The purpose of the simulations is to reveal the
direct and indirect energy states, carrier wavefunctions, and allowed optical
transitions for GaSb QDs with different physical dimensions.

Our theoretical understanding of glassy dynamics is notoriously incomplete,
and it is even more so when the glassy systems are driven out of equilibrium.
An extreme way to drive a system out of equilibrium is to introduce
nonequilibrium dynamics at the microscopic level, e.g., through active forcing
of the constituent particles or by having nonreciprocal interactions among the
particles. While glassy dynamics under active forcing has been studied by many,
the latter nonequilibrium scenario has received little attention. Here, I study
the glassy dynamics of the spherical $p$-spin model for $p\geq 3$ with
antisymmetric interactions, which generalizes reciprocal interactions in 2-body
interactions. The spherical $p$-spin model is an integral tool in the study of
dynamical glass transition, and when antisymmetric interactions are added, I
show analytically and numerically that glassy behavior is generically
suppressed. Moreover, I obtain analytical expressions on the modified dynamical
glass transition point and the Edward-Anderson parameter (i.e., the asymptotic
plateau height value of the spin-spin correlation function) in the small
driving limit.

In this study, we present the fabrication and characterization of
Ni/LiNbO3/Ni trilayers using RF sputtering. These trilayers exhibit thick Ni
layers (10 microns) and excellent adherence to the substrate, enabling high
magnetoelectric coefficients. By engineering the magnetic anisotropy of Nickel
through anisotropic thermal residual stress induced during fabrication, and by
selecting a carefully chosen cut angle for the LiNbO3 substrate, we achieved a
self-biased behavior. We demonstrate that these trilayers can power medical
implant devices remotely using a small AC magnetic field excitation, thereby
eliminating the need for a DC magnetic field and bulky magnetic field sources.
The results highlight the potential of these trilayers for the wireless and
non-invasive powering of medical implants. This work contributes to the
advancement of magnetoelectric materials and their applications in healthcare
technology.

<h3>Comment on "First-Principles Calculation of the Optical Rotatory Power  of Periodic Systems: Modern Theory with Modern Functionals''</h3>

The article [Desmarais \textit{et al.} Phys Rev. B. \textbf{107} 224430
(2023)] provided a generalization of the ``\textit{modern theory of orbital
magnetization}'' to include non-local Hamiltonians (e.g. hybrid functionals of
the generalized Kohn-Sham theory) for magnetic response properties. The
formulation was employed for the calculation of the optical rotatory power of
periodic systems, where results indicated inequivalence between sampling of
direct and reciprocal spaces for those calculations far from the complete basis
set limit. We show that such results can be explained by the fact that the
reported calculations correspond to an approximate treatment of the action of
the $\boldsymbol{\nabla_k}$ operator on Bloch orbitals. In the article,
calculations are missing a hidden ``response'' contribution to the
reciprocal-space derivatives. The missing response term is shown to (generally)
affect the results of calculations of not only magnetic, but also electric
response properties, within the context of the ``\textit{modern theory of
polarization}''. Necessary conditions are provided to permit avoiding the
calculation of the hidden response term.

We demonstrate the application of multislice ptychography to a twisted
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterointerface from a single-view data set. The
propagation from the top flake, through the interface, to the bottom flake is
visualized from separate slices of the reconstruction. The depth resolution of
the reconstruction is determined to be 2.74 nm, which is a significant
improvement over the aperture-limited depth resolution of 6.74 nm. This is
attributed to the diffraction signal extending beyond the aperture edge with
the depth resolution set by the curvature of the Ewald sphere. Future advances
to this approach could improve the depth resolution to the sub-nanometer level
and enable the identification of individual dopants, defects and color centers
in twisted heterointerfaces and other materials.
