<h3>Signatures of odd dynamics in viscoelastic systems: from spatiotemporal  pattern formation to odd rheology</h3>

Non-reciprocal interactions fueled by local energy consumption are found in
biological and synthetic active matter, where both viscosity and elasticity are
often important. Such systems can be described by "odd" viscoelasticity, which
assumes fewer material symmetries than traditional theories. In odd
viscoelastic systems there is an interplay between the energy-consuming odd
elastic elements and the traditional stabilizing elements. This leads to rich
dynamical behavior which, due to a lack of appropriate numerical methods, has
remained relatively unexplored. Furthermore, the implications associated with
the presence of such odd terms in actomyosin and other similar anisotropic
systems has not been addressed. Here, we study odd viscoelasticity analytically
and using hydrodynamic simulations based on the lattice Boltzmann algorithm. We
first outline how odd effects may naturally emerge from a theory of polymeric
elasticity which can describe anisotropic systems like actomyosin. Next, we
report on two striking features of odd viscoelastic dynamics: a pattern-forming
instability which produces an oscillating array of fluid vortices, and strong
transverse and rotational forces during a simulated rheological experiment.
These findings can guide efforts to detect or engineer odd dynamics in soft
active matter systems.

<br>
Producing compact voltage-controlled frequency generators and sensors
operating in the terahertz (THz) regime represents a major technological
challenge. Here, we show that noncollinear antiferromagnets (NCAFM) with kagome
structure host gapless self-oscillations whose frequencies are tunable from 0
Hz to the THz regime via electrically induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs). The
auto-oscillations' initiation, bandwidth, and amplitude are investigated by
deriving an effective theory, which captures the reactive and dissipative SOTs.
We find that the dynamics strongly depends on the ground state's chirality,
with one chirality having gapped excitations, whereas the opposite chirality
provides gapless self-oscillations. Our results reveal that NCAFMs offer unique
THz functional components, which could play a significant role in filling the
THz technology gap.

The emergence of collective order in matter is among the most fundamental and
intriguing phenomena in physics. In recent years, the ultrafast dynamical
control and creation of novel ordered states of matter not accessible in
thermodynamic equilibrium is receiving much attention. Among those, the
theoretical concept of dynamical multiferroicity has been introduced to
describe the emergence of magnetization by means of a time-dependent electric
polarization in non-ferromagnetic materials. In simple terms, a large amplitude
coherent rotating motion of the ions in a crystal induces a magnetic moment
along the axis of rotation. However, the experimental verification of this
effect is still lacking. Here, we provide evidence of room temperature
magnetization in the archetypal paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ due to this
mechanism. To achieve it, we resonantly drive the infrared-active soft phonon
mode with intense circularly polarized terahertz electric field, and detect a
large magneto-optical Kerr effect. A simple model, which includes two coupled
nonlinear oscillators whose forces and couplings are derived with ab-initio
calculations using self-consistent phonon theory at a finite temperature,
reproduces qualitatively our experimental observations on the temporal and
frequency domains. A quantitatively correct magnitude of the effect is obtained
when one also considers the phonon analogue of the reciprocal of the Einsten -
de Haas effect, also called the Barnett effect, where the total angular
momentum from the phonon order is transferred to the electronic one. Our
findings show a new path for designing ultrafast magnetic switches by means of
coherent control of lattice vibrations with light.

<h3>Isolating Chemical Reaction Mechanism as a Variable with Reactive  Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics: Step-Growth versus Chain-Growth  Polymerization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01758" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01758</a>

<br>
We present a general approach to isolate chemical reaction mechanism as an
independently controllable variable across chemically distinct systems. Modern
approaches to reduce the computational expense of molecular dynamics
simulations often group multiple atoms into a single "coarse-grained"
interaction site, which leads to a loss of chemical resolution. In this work we
convert this shortcoming into a feature and use identical coarse-grained models
to represent molecules that share non-reactive characteristics but react by
different mechanisms. As a proof of concept we use this approach to simulate
and investigate distinct, yet similar, trifunctional isocyanurate resin
formulations that polymerize by either chain- or step-growth. Since the
underlying molecular mechanics of these models are identical, all emergent
differences are a function of the reaction mechanism only. We find that the
microscopic morphologies resemble related all-atom simulations and that
simulated mechanical testing reasonably agrees with experiment.

<h3>Atomic Level Strain Induced by Static and Dynamic Oxygen Vacancies on  Reducible Oxide Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01764" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01764</a>
<br>

<br>
Surface strain often controls properties of the material including charge
transport and chemical reactivity. Localized surface strain is measured with
atomic resolution on (111) ceria nanoparticle surfaces using environmental
transmission electron microscopy under different redox conditions. Density
Functional Theory (DFT) coupled with TEM image simulations have been used for
aid in interpreting the experimental data. Oxygen vacancy creation/annihilation
introduces strain at surface and near surface regions on cation sublattice.
Static and fluxional strainmaps are generated from images at these different
conditions and compared. While fluxional strain is highest at locations
associated with unstable vacancies at active sites, highly inhomogeneous static
strain fields comprising of alternating tensile/compressing strain is seen at
surface and subsurfaces linked to the presence of stable oxygen vacancies.
Interestingly, both stable and unstable oxygen vacancies are found within a few
atomic spacing of each other on the same surface. The static strain pattern
depends on the ambient inside TEM. Oxidizing environments tend to lower vacancy
concentrations at the surface whereas a highly reducing environment created
using high electron dose creates oxygen vacancies everywhere (bulk and
surfaces) in the nanoparticle.

<h3>Superdiffusive Energy Transport in Kinetically Constrained Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01146" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01146</a>
<br>
<i>Marko Ljubotina, Jean-Yves Desaules, Maksym Serbyn, Zlatko Papić</i>
<br>
Universal nonequilibrium properties of isolated quantum systems are typically
probed by studying transport of conserved quantities, such as charge or spin,
while transport of energy has received considerably less attention. Here, we
study infinite-temperature energy transport in the kinetically-constrained PXP
model describing Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our state-of-the-art
numerical simulations, including exact diagonalization and time-evolving block
decimation methods, reveal the existence of two distinct transport regimes. At
moderate times, the energy-energy correlation function displays periodic
oscillations due to families of eigenstates forming different su(2)
representations hidden within the spectrum. These families of eigenstates
generalize the quantum many-body scarred states found in previous works and
leave an imprint on the infinite-temperature energy transport. At later times,
we observe a broad superdiffusive transport regime that we attribute to the
proximity of a nearby integrable point. Intriguingly, strong deformations of
the PXP model by the chemical potential do not restore diffusion, but instead
lead to a stable superdiffusive exponent $z\approx3/2$. Our results suggest
constrained models to be potential hosts of novel transport regimes and call
for developing an analytic understanding of their energy transport.

<h3>Probing domain wall dynamics in magnetic Weyl semimetals via the  non-linear anomalous Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01150</a>
<br>
<i>Shiva Heidari, Reza Asgari, Dimitrie Culcer</i>
<br>
The magnetic textures of Weyl semimetals are embedded into their topological
structure and interact dynamically with it. Here, we examine electric
field-induced structural phase transitions in domain walls mediated by the spin
transfer torque, and their footprint in charge transport. Remarkably, domain
wall dynamics lead to a transient, local, non-linear anomalous Hall effect and
non-linear anomalous drift current, which serve as direct probes of the
magnetization dynamics and of the domain wall location. We discuss experimental
observation in state-of-the-art samples.

<h3>Superconducting properties of doped blue phosphorene: Effects of  non-adiabatic approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01151</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammad Alidoosti, Davoud Nasr Esfahani, Reza Asgari</i>
<br>
We study the effects of Kohn anomalies on the superconducting properties in
electron- and hole-doped cases of monolayer blue phosphorene, considering both
adiabatic and non-adiabatic phonon dispersions using first-principles
calculations. We show that the topology of the Fermi surface is crucial for the
formation of Kohn anomalies of doped blue phosphorene. By using the anisotropic
Eliashberg formalism, we further carefully consider the temperature dependence
of the non-adiabatic phonon dispersions. In cases of low hole densities, strong
electron-phonon coupling leads to a maximum critical temperature of $T_c=97$ K
for superconductivity. In electron-doped regimes, on the other hand, a maximum
superconducting critical temperature of $T_c=38$ K is reached at a doping level
that includes a Lifshitz transition point. Furthermore, our results indicate
that the most prominent component of electron-phonon coupling arises from the
coupling between an in-plane (out-of-plane) deformation and in-plane
(out-of-plane) electronic states of the electron (hole) type doping.

<h3>Spin canting and lattice symmetry in La$_2$CuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01156" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01156</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao Hu, A. Sapkota, V. O. Galea, G. D. Gu, I. A. Zaliznyak, J. M. Tranquada</i>
<br>
While the dominant magnetic interaction in La$_2$CuO$_4$ is superexchange
between nearest-neighbor Cu moments, the pinning of the spin direction depends
on weak anisotropic effects associated with spin-orbit coupling. The symmetry
of the octahedral tilt pattern allows an out-of-plane canting of the Cu spins,
which is compensated by an opposite canting in nearest-neighbor layers. A
strong magnetic field applied perpendicular to the planes can alter the spin
canting pattern to induce a weak ferromagnetic phase. In light of recent
evidence that the lattice symmetry is lower than originally assumed, we take a
new look at the nature of the field-induced spin-rotation transition. Comparing
low-temperature neutron diffraction intensities for several magnetic Bragg
peaks measured in fields of 0 and 14 T, we find that a better fit is provided
by a model in which spins in neighboring layers counter-rotate in plane,
resulting in a noncollinear configuration. This model allows a consistent
relationship between lattice symmetry and spin orientation at all Cu sites.

<h3>Grand-canonical Monte-Carlo simulation methods for charge-decorated  cluster expansions</h3>

Monte-Carlo sampling of lattice model Hamiltonians is a well-established
technique in statistical mechanics for studying the configurational entropy of
crystalline materials. When species to be distributed on the lattice model
carry charge, the charge balance constraint on the overall system prohibits
single-site Metropolis exchanges in MC. In this article, we propose two methods
to perform MC sampling in the grand-canonical ensemble in the presence of a
charge-balance constraint. The table-exchange method (TE) constructs small
charge-conserving excitations, and the square-charge bias method (SCB) allows
the system to temporarily drift away from charge neutrality. We illustrate the
effect of internal hyper-parameters on the efficiency of these algorithms and
suggest practical strategies on how to apply these algorithms to real
applications.

<h3>Two-dimensional polaron spectroscopy of Fermi superfluids</h3>

Multidimensional spectroscopy is becoming an increasingly popular tool and
there is an ongoing effort to access electronic transitions and many-body
dynamics in correlated materials. We apply the protocol recently proposed by
Wang to extract two-dimensional polaron spectra in a Fermi superfluid with an
impurity. The bath is descibed by a BCS ansatz and it assumed that the impurity
can scatter at most one quasiparticle pair. The spectral response contains a
symmetric contribution, which carries the same information as Ramsey spectra,
and an asymmetric one. While {\it a priori} it may seem promising to probe the
quasiparticle gap from the asymmetric contribution, we show explicitly that
this is not the case and, in the absence of incoherent processes,
multidimensional spectroscopy does not bring much additional information. Our
calculation is suitable for 3D ultracold gases, but we discuss implications for
exciton-polarons in 2D materials.

<h3>Interplay of broken symmetry and delocalized excitations in the  insulating state of 1$T$-TaS$_2$</h3>

<br>
Coexistence of localized and extended excitations is central to the
macroscopic properties of correlated materials. For $5d$ transition metal
compounds, electron correlations alone generally do not lead to a
metal-insulator (Mott) transition, with insulating behavior usually resulting
from their coupling with magnetic ordering and/or structural distortions.
1$T$-TaS$_2$ is a prototypical example of such correlated insulating behavior,
with a high-symmetry metallic phase transforming into a distorted, charge
density wave (CDW) insulating state at low temperatures. The relevance of the
localized electron physics at play in $3d$ compounds to these $5d$ transition
metal compounds remains an open question. We resolved this standing controversy
in 1$T$-TaS$_2$ combining resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy and
first-principles calculations. We observed five electronic excitations arising
from the interband transitions of the Ta $5d$ orbitals and the S $3p$ ligand
state. These excitations cannot be explained within the framework of standard
multiplet calculations that assume a localized wavefunction, but instead, are
captured by a band theory framework accounting for the low symmetry of the
crystal field in the CDW state. Our findings suggest that the electronic
property of 1$T$-TaS$_2$ is dominated by both plasmonic quasiparticles and
inter-band transitions associated with a Drude-type response, with no resonance
associated with a putative Mott transition. Our discovery provides new insights
into the electron localization and the onset of insulating behavior in $5d$
transition metal materials.

<h3>$Z_3$ and $(\times Z_3)^3$ symmetry protected topological paramagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01187</a>
<br>
<i>Hrant Topchyan, Vasili Iugov, Mkhitar Mirumyan, Shahane A. Khachatryan, Tigran S. Hakobyan, Tigran A. Sedrakyan</i>
<br>
We identify three-state Potts paramagnets with gapless edge modes on a
triangular lattice protected by $(\times Z_3)^3\equiv Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$
symmetry and smaller $Z_3$ symmetry. We study microscopic models for the
gapless edge and discuss the corresponding conformal field theories and their
central charges. These are the edge states of $s=1$ paramagnets protected by
$Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$ and $Z_3$ symmetries, in analogy with the free
fermion XX model edge discussed by Levin and Gu for the spin-$1/2$ $Z_2$ Ising
paramagnet. We show that in spin-$1$ magnets, there are numerous options to
obtain self-dual Hamiltonians and gapless edge modes. These models form the
basis for the realization of a variety of symmetry-protected topological
phases, opening a window for studies of the unconventional quantum
criticalities between them.

<h3>Eigenvalue detachment, BBP transition and constrained Brownian motion</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander Gorsky, Sergei Nechaev, Alexander Valov</i>
<br>
We discuss the eigenvalue detachment transition in terms of scaling of
fluctuations in ensembles of paths located near convex boundaries of various
physical nature. We consider numerically the BBP-like (Baik-Ben
Arous-P\'ech\'e) transition from the Gaussian to the Tracy-Widom scaling of
fluctuations in several statistical systems for both canonical and
microcanonical ensembles and identify the corresponding control parameter in
each case. In particular, for fixed path length (microcanonical) ensemble of
paths located in the vicinity of a partially permeable semicircle, the
transition occurs at the critical value of a permeability. The Tracy-Widom
regime and the BBP-like transition for fluctuations are discussed in terms of
the Jakiw-Teitelbom (JT) gravity with a radial cutoff which, in turn, has an
interpretation as a ensemble of fixed length world-line geometrically
constrained trajectories of a charged particle in an effective transversal
magnetic field.

<h3>Sliding friction and superlubricity of colloidal AFM probes coated by  tribo-induced graphitic transfer layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01211</a>
<br>
<i>Renato Buzio, Andrea Gerbi, Cristina Bernini, Luca Repetto, Andrea Vanossi</i>
<br>
Colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows to explore sliding
friction phenomena in graphite contacts of nominal lateral size up to hundreds
of nanometers. It is known that contact formation involves tribo-induced
material transfer of graphite flakes from the graphitic substrate to the
colloidal probe. In this context, sliding states with nearly-vanishing
friction, i.e. superlubricity, may set in. A comprehensive investigation of the
transfer layer properties is mandatory to ascertain the origin of
superlubricity. Here we explore the friction response of micrometric beads, of
different size and pristine surface roughness, sliding on graphite under
ambient conditions. We show that such tribosystems undergo a robust transition
towards a low-adhesion, low-friction state dominated by mechanical interactions
at one dominant tribo-induced nanocontact. Friction force spectroscopy reveals
that the nanocontact can be superlubric or dissipative, in fact undergoing a
load-driven transition from dissipative stick-slip to continuous superlubric
sliding. This behavior is excellently described by the thermally-activated,
single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson model. Our results indicate that upon
formation of the transfer layer, friction depends on the energy landscape
experienced by the topographically-highest tribo-induced nanoasperity.
Consistently we find larger dissipation when the tribo-induced nanoasperity is
sled against surfaces with higher atomic corrugation than graphite, like MoS2
and WS2, in prototypical Van der Waals layered hetero-junctions.

<h3>Extra electron reflections in concentrated alloys may originate from  planar defects, not short-range order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01277" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01277</a>
<br>
<i>Flynn Walsh, Mingwei Zhang, Robert O. Ritchie, Andrew M. Minor, Mark Asta</i>
<br>
In many concentrated alloys of current interest, the observation of diffuse
superlattice intensities by transmission electron microscopy has been
attributed to the presence of chemical short-range order. This interpretation
is questioned on the basis of crystallographic considerations and theoretical
predictions of ordering. The work of Xiao and Daykin [Ultramicroscopy 53
(1994)], which shows how planar defects can produce the exact set of observed
peaks, is highlighted as an alternative explanation that would impact the
conclusions of a number of recent studies.

<h3>Strengthened proximity effect at grain boundaries to enhance inter-grain  supercurrent in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01305" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01305</a>
<br>
<i>Zhe Cheng, Chiheng Dong, Huan Yang, Qinghua Zhang, Satoshi Awaji, Lin Gu, Hai-Hu Wen, Yanwei Ma</i>
<br>
Iron-based superconductors have great potential for high-power applications
due to their prominent high-field properties. One of the central issues in
enhancing the critical current density of iron-based superconducting wires is
to reveal the roles and limitations of grain boundaries in supercurrent
transport. Here, we finely tuned the electronic properties of grain boundaries
by doping Ba1-xKxFe2As2 superconductors in a wide range (0.25<x<0.598). It is
found that the intra-grain Jcintra peaks near x~0.287, while the inter-grain
Jcinter has a maximum at about x~0.458. Remarkably, the grain boundary
transparency parameter defined as Jcinter/Jcintra rises monotonically with
doping. Through detailed microscopic analysis, we suggest that the FeAs
segregation phase commonly existing at grain boundaries and the adjacent grains
constitute superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) Josephson junctions
which play a key role in transporting supercurrent. A sandwich model based on
the proximity effect and the SNS junction is proposed to well interpret our
data. It is found that overdoping in superconducting grains largely strengthens
the proximity effect and consequently enhances the intergrain supercurrent. Our
results will shed new insights and inspirations for improving the application
parameters of iron-based superconductors by grain boundary engineering.

<h3>Excitons and their Fine Structure in Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals  from Atomistic GW/BSE Calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01324</a>
<br>
<i>Giulia Biffi, Yeongsu Cho, Roman Krahne, Timothy C. Berkelbach</i>
<br>
Atomistically detailed computational studies of nanocrystals, such as those
derived from the promising lead-halide perovskites, are challenging due to the
large number of atoms and lack of symmetries to exploit. Here, focusing on
methylammonium lead iodide nanocrystals, we combine a real-space tight binding
model with the GW approximation to the self-energy and obtain exciton
wavefunctions and absorption spectra via solutions of the associated
Bethe-Salpeter equation. We find that the size dependence of carrier
confinement, dielectric contrast, electron-hole exchange, and exciton binding
energies has a strong impact on the lowest excitation energy, which can be
tuned by almost 1 eV over the diameter range of 2-6 nm. Our calculated
excitation energies are about 0.2 eV higher than experimentally measured
photoluminescence, and they display the same qualitative size dependence.
Focusing on the fine structure of the band-edge excitons, we find that the
lowest-lying exciton is spectroscopically dark and about 20-30 meV lower in
energy than the higher-lying triplet of bright states, whose degeneracy is
slightly broken by crystal field effects.

<h3>A biological approach to metalworking based on chitinous colloids and  composites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01347" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01347</a>
<br>
<i>Shiwei Ng, Benjamin Ng Guan Zhi, Robert E. Simpson, Javier G. Fernandez</i>
<br>
Biological systems evolve with minimum metabolic costs and use common
components, and they represent guideposts toward a paradigm of manufacturing
that is centered on minimum energy, local resources, and ecological
integration. Here, we demonstrate a new biological method of working metal that
exploits the unique ability of chitin to incorporate metals into the arthropod
cuticle in order to aggregate colloidal suspensions of different metals into
solid ultra-low-binder-content composites. These composites, which can contain
more than 99.5% metal, simultaneously show both biological affinity and the
electrical conductivity and durability of metals. This approach stands in
contrast with existing energy-demanding metalworking methods, taking place at
ambient temperature and pressure and being driven by water exchange.
Furthermore, all the nonmetallic components involved are metabolized in large
amounts in every ecosystem. Under these conditions, we demonstrate the ability
of the composites to be printed and cast into functional shapes with metallic
characteristics. The affinity of chitometallic composites for other biological
components also allows them to infuse metallic characteristics into other
biomaterials. Our findings and robust manufacturing examples go well beyond
basic demonstrations and offer a generalizable new approach to metalworking. We
highlight the potential for a paradigm shift toward structural biomaterials
based on their unique characteristics and native manufacturing methods.

<h3>A Methodology to Generate Crystal-based Molecular Structures for  Atomistic Simulations</h3>

We propose a systematic method to construct crystal-based molecular
structures often needed as input for computational chemistry studies. These
structures include crystal ``slabs" with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs)
and non-periodic solids such as Wulff structures. We also introduce a method to

<h3>MyElas: An automatized tool-kit for high-throughput calculation,  post-processing and visualization of elasticity and related properties of  solids</h3>

Elasticity is one of the most fundamental mechanical properties of solid. In
high-throughput design of advanced materials, there is an imperative demand for
the capability to quickly calculate and screen a massive pool of candidate
structures. A fully automatized pipeline with minimal human intervention is the
key to provide high efficiency to achieve the goal. Here, we introduce a
tool-kit MyElas that aims to address this problem by forging all
pre-processing, elastic constant and other related property calculations, and
post-processing into an integrated framework that automatically performs the
assigned tasks to drive data flowing through parallelized pipelines from input
to output. The core of MyElas is to calculate the second and third order
elastic constants of a solid with the energy-strain method from
first-principles. MyElas can auto-analyze the elastic constants, to derive
other related physical quantities. Furthermore, the tool-kit also integrates a
visualization function, which can, for example, plot the spatial anisotropy of
elastic modulus and sound velocity of monocrystalline. The validity and
efficiency of the toolkit are tested and bench-marked on several typical
systems.

We have studied the localization of waves in a one-dimensional lattice
consisting of impurities where the spacing between consecutive impurities can
take certain values with given probabilities. In general, such a distribution
of impurities induces correlations in the disorder. In particular with a
power-law distribution of spacing, this system is used as a model for light
propagation in L\'{e}vy glasses. We introduce a method of calculating the
Lyapunov exponent which overcomes limitations in the previous studies and can
be easily extended to higher orders of perturbation theory. We obtain the
Lyapunov exponent up to fourth order of perturbation and discuss the range of
validity of perturbation theory, transparent states, and anomalous energies
which are characterized by divergences in different orders of the expansion. We
also carry out numerical simulations which are in agreement with our analytical
results.

Studying the physical properties of materials under high pressure and
temperature through experiments is difficult. Theoretical simulations can
compensate for this deficiency. Currently, large-scale simulations using
machine learning force fields are gaining popularity. As an important nuclear
energy material, the evolution of the physical properties of uranium under
extreme conditions is still unclear. Herein, we trained an accurate machine
learning force field on alpha-U and predicted the lattice dynamics and elastic
properties at high pressures and temperatures. The force field agrees well with
the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and experimental results, and it
exhibits higher accuracy than classical potentials. Based on the
high-temperature lattice dynamics study, we first present the
temperature-pressure range in which the Kohn anomalous behavior of the
${\Sigma}$4 optical mode exists. Phonon spectral function analysis showed that
the phonon anharmonicity of alpha-U is very weak. We predict that the
single-crystal elastic constants C44, C55, C66, polycrystalline modulus (E,G),
and polycrystalline sound velocity ($C_L$,$C_S$) have strong heating-induced
softening. All the elastic moduli exhibited compression-induced hardening
behavior. The Poisson's ratio shows that it is difficult to compress alpha-U at
high pressures and temperatures. Moreover, we observed that the material
becomes substantially more anisotropic at high pressures and temperatures. The
accurate predictions of alpha-U demonstrate the reliability of the method. This
versatile method facilitates the study of other complex metallic materials.

<br>
Torsion can be realized as dislocation in the crystal lattice of material. It
is particularly interesting if the material has fermions in the spectrum, such
as graphene, topological insulators, Dirac and Weyl semimetals, as it's
transport properties can be affected by the torsion. In this paper, we find
that, due to Weyl anomaly, ``torsion'' in Dirac and Weyl semimetals can induce
novel chiral currents, either near aboundary or in a ``conformally flat
space''. We briefly discuss how to measure this interesting effect in
experiment. It is remarkable that these experiments can help to clarify the
theoretical controversy of whether an imaginary Pontryagin density could appear
in the Weyl anomaly.

<br>
Neuromorphic computing (NC) is considered as a potential vehicle for
implementing energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI). To realize NC,
several materials systems are being investigated. Among them, the spin-orbit
torque (SOT) -driven domain wall (DW) devices are one of the potential
candidates. To implement these devices as neurons and synapses, the building
blocks of NC, researchers have proposed different device designs. However, the
experimental realization of DW device-based NC is only at the primeval stage.
In this study, we have proposed and investigated pine-tree-shaped DW devices,
based on the Laplace force on the elastic DWs, for achieving the synaptic
functionalities. We have successfully observed multiple magnetization states
when the DW was driven by the SOT current. The key observation is the
asymmetric pinning strength of the device when DW moves in two opposite
directions (defined as, xhard and xeasy). This shows the potential of these DW
devices as DW diodes. We have used micromagnetic simulations to understand the
experimental findings and to estimate the Laplace pressure for various design
parameters. The study leads to the path of device fabrication, where synaptic
properties are achieved with asymmetric pinning potential.

<h3>Quantum-geometry-induced anapole superconductivity</h3>

Anapole superconductivity recently proposed for multiband superconductors
[\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-022-00804-7}{Commun. Phys. $\bm
5$, 39\ (2022)}] is a key feature of time-reversal
($\mathcal{T}$)-symmetry-broken polar superconductors. The anapole moment was
shown to arise from the asymmetric Bogoliubov spectrum, which induces a finite
center of mass momenta of Cooper pairs at the zero magnetic field. In this
paper, we show an alternative mechanism of anapole superconductivity: the
quantum geometry induces the anapole moment when the interband pairing and
Berry connection are finite. Thus, the anapole superconductivity is a
ubiquitous feature of $\mathcal{T}$-broken multiband polar superconductors.
Applying the theory to a minimal model of UTe$_2$, we demonstrate the
quantum-geometry-induced anapole superconductivity. Furthermore, we show the
Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFS) in an anapole superconducting state and predict
an unusual temperature dependence of BFS due to the quantum geometry.
Experimental verification of these phenomena may clarify the superconducting
state in UTe$_2$ and reveal the ubiquitous importance of quantum geometry in
exotic superconductors.

<h3>The spin-flop transition in the quasi two dimensional antiferromagnet  MnPS3 detected via thermally generated magnon transport</h3>

<br>
<i>F. Feringa, J.M. Vink, B.J. van Wees</i>
<br>
We present the detection of the spin-flop transition in the antiferromagnetic
van der Waals material MnPS3 via thermally generated nonlocal magnon transport
using permalloy detector strips. The inverse anomalous spin Hall effect has the
unique power to detect an out-of-plane spin accumulation which enables us to
detect magnons with an out-of-plane spin polarization; in contrast to strips of
high spin-orbit material such as Pt which only possess the spin Hall effect and
are only sensitive to an in-plane spin polarization of the spin accumulation.
We show that nonlocal magnon transport is able to measure the spin-flop
transition in the absence of other spurious effects. Our measurements show the
detection of magnons generated by the spin Seebeck effect before and after the
spin-flop transition where the signal reversal of the magnon spin accumulation
agrees with the OOP spin polarization carried by magnon modes before and after
the SF transition.

Materials for time measurement represent a new class of functional materials,
that can be used to fabricate a variety of devices useful for industrial
applications, like for example the shelf-life indicators, solid-state
chronometers, compact detonators, etc. Materials for time measurement require
to have a continuously self-changing property that vary linearly during the
time. The particle-settling phenomenon can be advantageously used to fabricate
this type of materials. A theoretical model based on simple fluid-dynamics
considerations for Newtonian fluids has been developed to obtain the temporal
evolution of the electrical conductance for these materials in order to verify
its linear behaviour.

<h3>Local density of states as a probe for tunneling magnetoresistance  effect: application to ferrimagnetic tunnel junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>Katsuhiro Tanaka, Takuya Nomoto, Ryotaro Arita</i>
<br>
We investigate the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect using the lattice
models which describe the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ). First, taking a
conventional ferromagnetic MTJ as an example, we show that the product of the
local density of states (LDOS) at the center of the barrier traces the TMR
effect qualitatively. The LDOS inside the barrier has the information on the
electrodes and the electron tunneling through the barrier, which enables us to
easily evaluate the tunneling conductance more precisely than the conventional
Julliere's picture. We then apply this method to the MTJs with collinear
ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets. We find that the TMR effect in the
ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic MTJs changes depending on the interfacial
magnetic structures originating from the sublattice structure, which can also
be captured by the LDOS. Our findings will reduce the computational cost for
the qualitative evaluation of the TMR effect, and be useful for a broader
search for the materials which work as the TMR devices showing high
performance.

<h3>Bragg diffraction by a magnetic all-in-all-out configuration with  application to a cubic cerium pyrochlore oxide</h3>

<br>
The Bragg diffraction of neutrons and x-rays are well-suited to the task of
determining the distribution of magnetization in crystals. Applications of the
two techniques proceed by contrasting observed intensities with intensities
calculated with a specific model, and changing the model as need be to achieve
satisfactory agreement. An all-in-all-out (AIAO) magnetic configuration of
magnetic dipoles on a cubic face-centred lattice with networks of
corner-sharing tetrahedra is often mentioned in the context of pyrochlore
oxides, for example, but the corresponding neutron and x-ray diffraction
patterns appear not have been calculated. Our results for patterns of Bragg
spots from an AIAO magnetic configuration defined by a magnetic space group are
symmetry informed and yield exact reflection conditions. Specifically, a
long-range order of magnetic dipoles is forbidden in our model. Bulk properties
arise from higher-order multipoles that include quadrupoles and octupoles.
Bragg spots that exclude all magnetic multipoles other than an octupole have
been discovered, and they can be observed by both neutron diffraction and
resonant x-ray diffraction. All magnetic multipoles allowed in diffraction by
cerium ions (4f1) are presented in terms of coefficients in a well-documented
and unusual magnetic ground state. Symmetry of the cerium site in the cubic
structure constrains the coefficients. Our scattering amplitudes have an
application in both neutron and x-ray diffraction experiments on Ce2Zr2O7, for
example, and searches for the sought-after cerium octupole. Also presented for
future use is a result for the total, energy-integrated magnetic neutron
scattering intensity by a powder sample. Unsurprisingly, total scattering is
devoid of all information about the powder sample other than the atomic
configuration of the magnetic ions.

<h3>Method to preserve the chiral-symmetry protection of the zeroth Landau  level on a two-dimensional lattice</h3>

<br>
The spectrum of massless Dirac fermions on the surface of a topological
insulator in a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ contains a $B$-independent
"zeroth Landau level", protected by chiral symmetry. If the Dirac equation is
discretized on a lattice by the method of "Wilson fermions", the chiral
symmetry is broken and the zeroth Landau level is broadened when $B$ has
spatial fluctuations. We show how this lattice artefact can be avoided starting
from an alternative nonlocal discretization scheme introduced by Stacey. A key
step is to spatially separate the states of opposite chirality in the zeroth
Landau level, by adjoining $+B$ and $-B$ regions.

<h3>Domain Wall Propagation and Pinning Induced by Current Pulses in  Cylindrical Modulated Nanowires</h3>

<br>
The future developments of three-dimensional magnetic nanotechnology require
the control of domain wall dynamics by means of current pulses. While this has
been extensively studied in planar magnetic strips (planar nanowires), few
reports exist in cylindrical geometry, where Bloch point domain walls are
expected to have intriguing properties. Here we report this investigation in
cylindrical magnetic Ni nanowires with geometrical notches. Experimental work
based on synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) combined with
photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) indicates that large current densities
induce domain wall nucleation while smaller currents move domain walls
preferably against the current direction. In the region where no pinning
centers are present we found domain wall velocity of about 1 km/s. The domain
wall motion along current was also detected in the vicinity of the notch
region. Pinning of domain walls has been observed not only at geometrical
constrictions but also outside of them. Thermal modelling indicates that large
current densities temporarily raise the temperature in the nanowire above the
Curie temperature leading to nucleation of domain walls during the system
cooling. Micromagnetic modelling with spin-torque effect shows that for
intermediate current densities Bloch point domain walls with chirality parallel
to the Oersted field propagate antiparallel to the current direction. In other
cases, domain walls can be bounced from the notches and/or get pinned outside
their positions. We thus find that current is not only responsible for the
domain wall propagation but is also a source of pinning due to the Oersted
field action.

<br>
Domain pattern transfer from ferroelectric to ferromagnetic materials is a
critical step for the electric field control of magnetism and has the potential
to provide new schemes for low-power data storage and computing devices. Here
we investigate domain coupling in BaTiO$_3$(111)/CoFeB heterostructures by
direct imaging in a wide-field Kerr microscope. The magnetic easy axis is found
to locally change direction as a result of the underlying ferroelectric domains
and their polarisation. By plotting the remanent magnetisation as a function of
angle in the plane of the CoFeB layer, we find that the magnetic easy axes in
adjacent domains are angled at 60$^\circ$ or 120$^\circ$, corresponding to the
angle of rotation of the polarisation from one ferroelectric domain to the
next, and that the magnetic domain walls may be charged or uncharged depending
on the magnetic field history. Micromagnetic simulations show that the
properties of the domain walls vary depending on the magnetoelastic easy axis
configuration and the charged or uncharged nature of the wall. The
configuration where the easy axis alternates by 60$^\circ$ and a charged wall
is initialised exhibits the largest change in domain wall width from 192 nm to
119 nm as a function of in-plane magnetic field. Domain wall width tuning
provides an additional degree of freedom for devices that seek to manipulate
magnetic domain walls using strain coupling to ferroelectrics.

<br>
In this work, we synthesize and investigate lower technetium hydrides at
pressures up to 45 GPa using the synchrotron X-ray diffraction, reflectance
spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations. In the Tc-H system, the hydrogen
content in TcH$_x$ phases increases when the pressure rises, and at 27 GPa we
found a new hexagonal (hcp) nonstoichiometric hydride TcH$_{1.3}$. The
formation of technetium hydrides is also confirmed by the emergence of a new
reflective band at 450-600 nm in the reflectance spectra of TcH$_x$ samples
synthesized at 45 GPa. On the basis of the theoretical analysis, we proposed
crystal structures for the TcH$_{0.45 \pm 0.05}$ (Tc$_{16}$H$_7$) and
TcH$_{0.75 \pm 0.05}$ (Tc$_4$H$_3$) phases previously obtained at 1-2 GPa. The
calculations of the electron-phonon interaction show that technetium hydrides
TcH$_{1+x}$ do not possess superconducting properties due to the low
electron-phonon interaction parameter ($\lambda \sim 0.23$).

<br>
We study a hybrid device defined in an InAs nanowire with an epitaxial Al
shell that consists of a quantum dot in contact with a superconducting island.
The device is electrically floating, prohibiting transport measurements, but
providing access to states that would otherwise be highly excited and unstable.
Radio-frequency reflectometry with lumped-element resonators couples
capacitatively to the quantum dot, and detects the presence of discrete subgap
states. We perform a detailed study of the case with no island states, but with
quantum-dot-induced subgap states controlled by the tunnel coupling. When the
gap to the quasi-continuum of the excited states is small, the capacitance
loading the resonator is strongly suppressed by thermal excitations, an effect
we dub ``thermal screening''. The resonance frequency shift and changes in the
quality factor at charge transitions can be accounted for using a single-level
Anderson impurity model. The established measurement method, as well as the
analysis and simulation framework, are applicable to more complex hybrid
devices such as Andreev molecules or Kitaev chains.

<br>
Despite the extensive study of matter-wave superradiance in a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) using its unique coherence property, the controllability of
superradiant process has remained limited in the previous studies exploiting a
phase-coherent condensate with isotropic contact interactions. Here, we combine
tunable s-wave scattering with dipolar interactions in a BEC of $^{168}$Er
atoms wherein the asymmetry and threshold of superradiance are independently
controlled. By changing the s-wave scattering length near the Feshbach
resonance, we tune the superradiance threshold with increasing phase
fluctuations. In contrast to collective light scattering from a condensate only
with contact interactions, we observe an asymmetric superradiant peak in a
dipolar BEC by changing the direction of external magnetic field. This results
from the anisotropic excitation spectrum induced by the dipole-dipole
interaction. Our observation is expected to bring forth unprecedented
application of matter-wave optics leading to controlled emission of matter
wave.

<br>
We study an XXZ spin chain, where each spin is coupled to an independent
ohmic bath of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature. Using bosonization and
numerical techniques, we show the existence of two phases separated by an
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition. At low coupling with the bath, the chain
remains in a Luttinger liquid phase with a reduced but finite spin stiffness,
while above a critical coupling the system is in a dissipative phase
characterized by a vanishing spin stiffness. We argue that the transport
properties are also inhibited: the Luttinger liquid is a perfect conductor
while the dissipative phase displays finite resistivity. Our results show that
the effect of the bath can be interpreted as annealed disorder inducing
signatures of localization.

The symmetry of the whole experimental setups, including specific sample
environments and measurables, can be compared with that of specimens for
observable physical phenomena. We, first, focus on one-dimensional (1D)
experimental setups, independent from any spatial rotation around one
direction, and show that eight kinds of 1D objects (four; vectorlike, the other
four; director-like), defined in terms of symmetry, and their dot and cross
products are an effective way for the symmetry consideration. The dot products
form a Z2xZ2xZ2 group with Abelian additive operation, and the cross products
form a Z2xZ2 group with Abelian additive operation or Q8, a non-abelian group
of order eight, depending on their signs. Those 1D objects are associated with
characteristic physical phenomena. When a 3D specimen has Symmetry Operational
Similarity (SOS) with (identical or lower, but not higher, symmetries than) an
1D object with a particular phenomenon, the 3D specimen can exhibit the
phenomenon. This SOS approach can be a transformative and unconventional avenue
for symmetry-guided materials designs and discoveries.

Ultrafast electron-photon spectroscopy in electron microscopes commonly
requires ultrafast laser setups. Photoemission from an engineered electron
source is used to generate pulsed electrons, interacting with a sample that is
excited by the ultrafast laser pulse at a specified time delay. Thus,
developing an ultrafast electron microscope demands the exploitation of
extrinsic laser excitations and complex synchronization schemes. Here, we
present an inverse approach based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to
introduce internal radiation sources in an electron microscope. Our method is
based on a sequential interaction of the electron beam with an electron-driven
photon source (EDPHS) and the investigated sample. An electron-driven photon
source in an electron microscope generates phase-locked photons that are
mutually coherent with the near-field distribution of the swift electron. Due
to their different velocities, one can readily change the delay between the
photons and electrons arriving at the sample by changing the distance between
the EDPHS and the sample. We demonstrate the mutual coherence between the
radiations from the EDPHS and the sample by performing interferometry with a
combined system of an EDPHS and a WSe2 flake. We assert the mutual frequency
and momentum-dependent correlation of the EDPHS and sample radiation, and
determine experimentally the degree of mutual coherence of up to 27%. This
level of mutual coherence allows us to perform spectral interferometry with an
electron microscope. Our method has the advantage of being simple, compact and
operating with continuous electron beams. It will open the door to local
electron-photon correlation spectroscopy of quantum materials, single photon
systems, and coherent exciton-polaritonic samples with nanometric resolution.

<br>
We show that Ge concentration oscillations within the quantum well region of
a Si/SiGe heterostructure can significantly enhance the spin-orbit coupling of
the low-energy conduction-band valleys. Specifically, we find that for Ge
oscillation wavelengths near $\lambda = 1.57~\text{nm}$, a Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling is produced that is over an order of magnitude larger than
what is found in conventional Si/SiGe heterostructures without Ge concentration
oscillations. We also provide a detailed explanation for this resonance
phenomenon. This involves the Ge concentration oscillations producing
wavefunction satellite peaks a distance $2 \pi/\lambda$ away in momentum space
from each valley, which then couple to the opposite valley through Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling. Our results indicate that the enhanced spin-orbit coupling
can enable fast spin manipulation within Si quantum dots using electric dipole
spin resonance in the absence of micromagnets. Indeed, our calculations yield a
Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\text{Rabi}}/B > 500~\text{MHz/T}$ near the optimal Ge
oscillation wavelength $\lambda = 1.57~\text{nm}$

Mechanical straining of skyrmion hosting materials has previously
demonstrated increased phase stability through the expansion of the skyrmion
equilibrium pocket. Additionally, metastable skyrmions can be generated via
rapid field-cooling to form significant skyrmion populations at low
temperatures. Using small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray holographic imaging
on a thermally strained 200 nm thick FeGe lamella, we observe
temperature-induced strain effects on the structure and metastability of the
skyrmion lattice. We find that in this sample orientation (H || [1 1 0]) with
no strain, metastable skyrmions produced by field cooling through the
equilibrium skyrmion pocket vanish from the sample upon dropping below the well
known helical reorientation temperature. However, when strain is applied along
[110] axis, and this procedure is repeated, a substantial volume fraction of
metastable skyrmions persist upon cooling below this temperature down to 100 K.
Additionally, we observe a large number of skyrmions retained after a complete
magnetic field polarity reversal, implying that the metastable energy barrier
protecting skyrmions from decay is enhanced.

Recently, the interplay between the Dirac/Weyl fermion and various bulk
properties, such as magnetism, has attracted considerable attention, since
unconventional transport and optical phenomena were discovered. However, the
design principles for such materials have not been established well. Here, we
propose that the layered material $A$Mn$X_2$ ($A$: alkaline and rare-earth
ions, $X$: Sb, Bi) is a promising platform for systematically exploring
strongly correlated Dirac metals, which consists of the alternative stack of
the $X^-$ square net layer hosting a 2D Dirac fermion and the
$A^{2+}$-Mn$^{2+}$-$X^{3-}$ magnetic block layer. In this article, we shall
review recent high-field studies on this series of materials to demonstrate
that various types of Dirac fermions are realized by designing the block layer.
First, we give an overview of the Dirac fermion coupled with the magnetic order
in EuMnBi$_2$ ($A$=Eu). This material exhibits large magnetoresistance by the
field-induced change in the magnetic order of Eu layers, which is associated
with the strong exchange interaction between the Dirac fermion and the local Eu
moment. Second, we review the Dirac fermion coupled with the lattice
polarization in BaMn$X_2$ ($A$=Ba). There, spin-valley coupling manifests
itself owing to the Zeeman-type spin-orbit interaction, which is experimentally
evidenced by the bulk quantum Hall effect observed at high fields.

The temperature dependence of experimental charge carrier mobility is
commonly used as a predictor of the dominant carrier scattering mechanism in
semiconductors, particularly in thermoelectric applications. In this work, we
critically evaluate whether this practice is well founded. A review of 47
state-of-the-art mobility calculations reveals no correlation between the major
scattering mechanism and the temperature trend of mobility. Instead, we
demonstrate that the phonon frequencies are the prevailing driving forces
behind the temperature dependence and can cause it to vary between $T^{-1}$ to
$T^{-3}$ even for an idealised material. To demonstrate this, we calculate the
mobility of 23,000 materials and review their temperature dependence, including
separating the contributions from deformation, polar, and impurity scattering
mechanisms. We conclusively demonstrate that a temperature dependence of
$T^{-1.5}$ is not a reliable indicator of deformation potential scattering. Our
work highlights the potential pitfalls of predicting the major scattering type
based on the experimental mobility temperature trend alone.

We consider critical eigenstates in a two dimensional quasicrystal and their
evolution as a function of disorder. By exact diagonalization of finite size
systems we show that the evolution of the spectral properties of a typical
wavefunction is non-monotonic. That is, disorder leads to states delocalizing,
until a certain crossover disorder strength is attained, after which they start
to localize. This non-monotonic evolution of spatial properties of eigenstates
can be observed in the anomalous dimensions of the wavefunction amplitudes, in
their multifractal spectra, and in their dynamical properties. We compute the
two-point correlation functions of wavefunction amplitudes and show that these
follow power laws in distance and energy, consistent with the idea that
wavefunctions retain their multifractal structure on a scale which depends on
disorder strength. Finally dynamical properties are studied as a function of
disorder. We find that the diffusion exponents do not reflect the non-monotonic
wavefunction evolution. Instead, they are essentially independent of disorder
until disorder increases beyond the crossover value, after which they decrease
rapidly, until the strong localization regime is reached. The differences
between our results and earlier studies on geometrically disordered
``phason-flip'' models lead us to propose that the two models are in different
universality classes. We conclude by discussing some implications of our
results for transport and a proposal for a Mott hopping mechanism between power
law localized wavefunctions, in moderately disordered quasicrystals.

<h3>$ζ$-Pade SRWS theory with lowest order approximation</h3>

In my previous paper about SRWS-$\zeta$ theory[Y.Ueoka,viXra:2205.014,2022],
I proposed an approximation of rough averaged summation of typical critical
Green function for the Anderson transition in the Orthogonal class. In this
paper, I remove a rough approximate summation for the series of the typical
critical Green function by replacing summation with integral. Pade approximant
is used to take a summation. The perturbation series of the critical exponent
$\nu$ of localization length from upper critical dimension is obtained. The
dimensional dependence of the critical exponent is again directly related with
Riemann $\zeta$ function. Degree of freedom about lower critical exponent
improve estimate compared with previous studies. When I fix lower critical
dimension equal to two, I obtained similar estimate of the critical exponent
compared with fitting curve estimate of the critical exponent[E.Tarquini et
al.,PhysRevB.95(2017)094204]. 1

We use a theoretical model to explore how fluid dynamics, in particular, the
pressure gradient and wall shear stress in a channel, affect the deposition of
particles flowing in a microfluidic network. Experiments on transport of
colloidal particles in pressure-driven systems of packed beads have shown that
at lower pressure drop, particles deposit locally at the inlet, while at higher
pressure drop, they deposit uniformly along the direction of flow. We develop a
mathematical model and use agent-based simulations to capture these essential
qualitative features observed in experiments. We explore the deposition profile
over a two-dimensional phase diagram defined in terms of the pressure and shear
stress threshold, and show that two distinct phases exist. We explain this
apparent phase transition by drawing an analogy to simple one-dimensional
models of aggregation in which the phase transition is calculated analytically.
