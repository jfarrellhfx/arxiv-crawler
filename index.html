<h3>Lock-Key Microfluidics: Simulating Nematic Colloid Advection along  Wavy-Walled Channels</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07367" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07367</a>

</p><i>Karolina Wamsler, Louise C. Head, Tyler N. Shendruk</i>
<p>Liquid crystalline media mediate interactions between suspended particles and
confining geometries, which not only has potential to guide patterning and
bottom-up colloidal assembly, but can also control colloidal migration in
microfluidic devices. However, simulating such dynamics is challenging because
nemato-elasticity, diffusivity and hydrodynamic interactions must all be
accounted for within complex boundaries. We model the advection of colloids
dispersed in flowing and fluctuating nematic fluids confined within 2D wavy
channels. A lock-key mechanism between colloids and troughs is found to be
stronger for planar anchoring compared to homeotropic anchoring due to the
relative location of the colloid-associated defects. Sufficiently large
amplitudes result in stick-slip trajectories and even permanent locking of
colloids in place. These results demonstrate that wavy walls not only have
potential to direct colloids to specific docking sites but also to control
site-specific resting duration and intermittent elution.

<h3>Intricate Magnetism and Topological Hall Effect Observed in  Cr$_{0.83}$Te</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07237" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07237</a>

</p><i>Shubham Purwar, Susmita Changdar, Susanta Ghosh, Tushar Kanti Bhowmik, S. Thirupathaiah</i>
<p>We report the magnetic, electrical, and magnetotransport (Hall effect)
properties of the hexagonal itinerant ferromagnet Cr$_{0.83}$Te. Further, a
comprehensive study of the magneto-entropy scaling behavior has been done
around the Curie temperature of $T_C \approx$ 338 K. A maximum entropy change
(-$\Delta S_{m}^{max}$) of 2.77 $J/kg-K$ and relative cooling power (RCP) of
88.29 $J/kg$ near the T$_C$ have been achieved under an applied magnetic field
of 5 Tesla. The critical exponents, $\beta$ = 0.4739(4), $\gamma$ = 1.2812(3),
and $\delta$ = 3.7037(5), have been extracted using the magneto-entropy scaling
analysis. The obtained critical exponents indicate the presence of intricate
magnetic interactions in Cr$_{0.83}$Te. On the other hand, the magnetotransport
study reveals a topological Hall effect attributed to the noncoplanar spin
structure coexisting with a robust magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Further, we
observe that the extrinsic skew-scattering mechanism originated anomalous Hall
effect. Our experimental findings of the anomalous and topological Hall effect
properties in the presence of intriguing high-temperature itinerant
ferromagnetism and magnetocaloric effect in Cr$_{0.83}$Te can offer potential
technological applications at room temperature.

<h3>Topological Heavy Fermion Principle For Flat (Narrow) Bands With  Concentrated Quantum Geometry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07253" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07253</a>

</p><i>Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Jiabin Yu, Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Nicolas Regnault, Chaoxing Liu, Sankar Das Sarma, Oskar Vafek, Piers Coleman, Alexei Tsvelik, Zhi-da Song, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<p>We propose a general principle for the low-energy theory of narrow bands with
concentrated Berry curvature and Fubini-Study metric in the form of a map to
Anderson-"+" models composed of heavy fermions hybridizing and interacting with
semi-metallic modes. This map resolves the obstruction preventing topological
bands from being realized in a local Hamiltonian acting on the low-energy
degrees of freedom. The concentrated quantum geometry is reproduced through
band inversion with a dispersive semi-metal, leaving a nearly flat, trivial
band which becomes the heavy fermion. This representation is natural when the
narrow band is not energetically isolated on the scale of the interaction and
an enlarged Hilbert space is inescapable, but also provides analytical insight
into the projected-interaction limit. First exemplified in twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG), we extend it to (1) the twisted checkerboard, which we find has
a chiral symmetric stable anomaly that forbids a lattice realization at all
energies, and (2) the Lieb lattice with gapless flat bands, where we show the
heavy fermions can be obtained by minimizing a Euclidean instanton action to
saturate its BPS bound. The heavy fermion approach is widely applicable and
physically transparent: heavy electrons carry the strong correlations and
dispersive electrons carry the topology. This simple picture unifies the
dichotomous phenomena observed in TBG and points to connections between moir\'e
and stoichiometric materials.

<h3>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a  quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian  anyons</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zhengzhi Wu, Jing-yun Zhang, Hong Yao</i>
<p>The spin-S Kitaev model has recently been shown to definitely exhibit
topological order with spin liquid ground states for half-integer spin, but
could be trivially gapped insulators for integer spin. This interesting
"even-odd" effect is largely due to the fermionic (bosonic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge charges for half-integer (integer) spin. In this Letter, we theoretically
show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation
symmetry) possesses exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for
any spin (both integer and half integer spin), which implies a
topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state
regardless of the value of the spin quantum number. We further study the
easy-axis limit of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model which can be solved in a controlled
perturbative way and show that it exhibits a gapless QSOL ground state, which
can even host a non-Abelian topological order by further considering
time-reversal breaking interactions to gap out the Dirac cones of the gapless
QSOL.

<h3>The planted directed polymer: inferring a random walk from noisy images</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07263" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07263</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sun Woo P. Kim, Austen Lamacraft</i>
<p>We introduce and study the planted directed polymer, in which the path of a
random walker is inferred from noisy 'images' accumulated at each timestep.
Formulated as a nonlinear problem of Bayesian inference for a hidden Markov
model, this problem is a generalization of the directed polymer problem of
statistical physics, coinciding with it in the limit of zero signal to noise.
For a 1D walker we present numerical investigations and analytical arguments
that no phase transition is present. When formulated on a Cayley tree, methods
developed for the directed polymer are used to show that there is a transition
with decreasing signal to noise where effective inference becomes impossible,
meaning that the average fractional overlap between the inferred and true paths
falls from one to zero.

<br>
</p><i>Qian Lei, Boris Khusid, Lou Kondic, Paul M. Chaikin, Andrew D. Hollingsworth, Alton J. Reich, Richard B. Rodgers, William V. Meyer</i>
<p>Here we report the results of microgravity experiments performed on the
International Space Station (ISS) to study crystallized, metastable colloidal
liquids in the region of the hard sphere phase diagram that has been found to
be glassy on Earth. Using confocal microscopy, we observed the self-assembly of
high density, three-dimensional colloidal crystals from micron-size hard
spheres suspended within a fluid medium. The largest face-centered cubic (FCC)
phase measured 27 x 1.5 x 0.15 mm. From a practical aspect, the fact that a
single, topological defect-free FCC colloidal crystal can be grown in
microgravity and the crystal returned from orbit suggests new routes for
manufacturing colloidal devices, particularly optical elements in space.

<h3>Effective uniaxial dielectric function tensor and optical phonons in  ($\bar{2}01$)-plane oriented $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with  equally-distributed six-fold rotation domains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07300</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alyssa Mock, Steffen Richter, Alexis Papamichail, Vallery Stanishev, Misagh Ghezellou, Jawad Ul-Hassan, Andreas Popp, Saud Bin Anooz, Daniella Gogova, Praneeth Ranga, Sriram Krishnamoorthy, Rafal Korlacki, Mathias Schubert, Vanya Darakchieva</i>
<p>Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $c$-plane sapphire have been
shown to exhibit six $(\bar{2}01)$-plane oriented domains, which are
equally-spaced-by-rotation around the surface normal and
equally-sized-by-volume that render the film optical response effectively
uniaxial. We derive and discuss an optical model suitable for ellipsometry data
analysis of such films. We model mid- and far-infrared ellipsometry data from
undoped and electrically insulating films with an effective uniaxial dielectric
tensor based on projections of all phonon modes within the rotation domains
parallel and perpendicular to the sample normal, i.e., to the reciprocal
lattice vector $\mathbf{g}_{\bar{2}01}$. Two effective response functions are
described by model, and found sufficient to calculate ellipsometry data that
best-match measured ellipsometry data from a representative film. We propose to
render either effective dielectric functions, or inverse effective dielectric
functions, each separately for electric field directions parallel and
perpendicular to $\mathbf{g}_{\bar{2}01}$, by sums of Lorentz oscillators,
which permit to determine either sets of transverse optical phonon mode
parameters, or sets of longitudinal optical phonon mode parameters,
respectively. Transverse optical modes common to both dielectric functions can
be traced back to single crystal modes with $B_{\mathrm{u}}$ character, while
modes with $A_{\mathrm{u}}$ character only appear within the dielectric
function for polarization perpendicular to the sample surface. The thereby
obtained parameter sets reveal all phonon modes anticipated from averaging over
the six-fold rotation domains of single crystal $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, but with
slightly shifted transverse optical, and completely different longitudinal
optical phonon modes.

<h3>Exact results for the Ising model on a small-world network</h3>

<br>
</p><i>M. Ostilli</i>
<p>Small-world networks provide an interesting framework for studying the
interplay between regular and random graphs, where links are located in a
regular and random way, respectively. On one hand, the random links make the
model to obey some kind of mean-field behavior. On the other hand, the links of
the regular lattice make the system to retain some related non trivial
correlations. The coexistence of these two features in general prevent a closed
analytical treatment. Here we consider a one-dimensional small-world Ising
model and derive analytically its equation of state, critical point, critical
behavior, and critical correlations. Despite being one of the simplest
small-world models, our exact and intuitive analysis reveals some intriguing
properties.

<h3>Nonlinear Hall effect in isotropic k-cubed Rashba model:  Berry-curvature-dipole engineering by in-plane magnetic field</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07352" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07352</a>
<br>
</p><i>A. Krzyzewska, A. Dyrdal</i>
<p>The linear and nonlinear Hall effects in 2D systems are considered
theoretically within the isotropic k-cubed Rashba model. We show that the
presence of an out-of-plane external magnetic field or net magnetization is a
necessary condition to induce a nonzero Berry curvature in the system, whereas
an in-plane magnetic field tunes the Berry curvature leading to the Berry
curvature dipole. Interestingly, in the linear response regime, the
conductivity is dominated by the intrinsic component (Berry curvature
component), whereas the second-order correction to the Hall current (i.e., the
conductivity proportional to the external electric field) is dominated by the
component independent of the Berry curvature dipole.

<h3>Origin of pinning disorder in magnetic-field-induced Wigner solids</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Matthew L. Freeman, P.T. Madathil, L. N. Pfeiffer, K.W. Baldwin, Y.J. Chung, R. Winkler, M. Shayegan, L. W. Engel</i>
<p>At low Landau level filling factors ($\nu$), Wigner solid phases of
two-dimensional electron systems in GaAs are pinned by disorder, and exhibit a
pinning mode, whose frequency is a measure of the disorder that pins the Wigner
solid. Despite numerous studies spanning the last three decades, the origin of
the disorder that causes the pinning and determines the pinning mode frequency
remains unknown. Here we present a study of the pinning mode resonance in the
low-$\nu$ Wigner solid phases of a series of ultralow-disorder GaAs quantum
wells which are similar except for their varying well widths, $d$. The pinning
mode frequencies,$f_p$, decrease strongly as $d$ increases, with the widest
well exhibiting $f_p$ as low as $\simeq$35 MHz. The amount of reduction of \fp\
with increasing $d$ can be explained remarkably well by tails of the wave
function impinging into the alloy-disordered Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As barriers that
contain the electrons. However, it is imperative that the model for the
confinement and wave function includes the Coulomb repulsion in the growth
direction between the electrons as they occupy the quantum well.

<h3>Building Workflows for Interactive Human in the Loop Automated  Experiment (hAE) in STEM-EELS</h3>

<p>Exploring the structural, chemical, and physical properties of matter on the
nano- and atomic scales has become possible with the recent advances in
aberration-corrected electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM). However, the current paradigm of
STEM-EELS relies on the classical rectangular grid sampling, in which all
surface regions are assumed to be of equal a priori interest. This is typically
not the case for real-world scenarios, where phenomena of interest are
concentrated in a small number of spatial locations. One of foundational
problems is the discovery of nanometer- or atomic scale structures having
specific signatures in EELS spectra. Here we systematically explore the
hyperparameters controlling deep kernel learning (DKL) discovery workflows for
STEM-EELS and identify the role of the local structural descriptors and
acquisition functions on the experiment progression. In agreement with actual
experiment, we observe that for certain parameter combinations the experiment
path can be trapped in the local minima. We demonstrate the approaches for
monitoring automated experiment in the real and feature space of the system and
monitor knowledge acquisition of the DKL model. Based on these, we construct
intervention strategies, thus defining human-in the loop automated experiment
(hAE). This approach can be further extended to other techniques including 4D
STEM and other forms of spectroscopic imaging.

<h3>A Pathway to Efficient Simulations of Charge Density Waves in Transition  Metal Dichalcogenides: A Case Study for TiSe2</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07414</a>
<br>
</p><i>Li Yin, Hong Tang, Tom Berlijn, Adrienn Ruzsinszky</i>
<p>Charge density waves (CDWs) in transition metal dichalcogenides are the
subject of growing scientific interest due to their rich interplay with exotic
phases of matter and their potential technological applications. Here, using
density functional theory with advanced meta-generalized gradient
approximations (meta-GGAs) and linear response time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT) with state-of-the-art exchange-correlation kernels,
we investigate the electronic, vibrational, and optical properties in 1T-TiSe2
with and without CDW. In both bulk and monolayer TiSe2, the electronic bands
and phonon dispersions in either normal (semi-metallic) or CDW (semiconducting)
phase are described well via meta-GGAs, which separate the valence and
conduction bands just as HSE06 does but with significantly more computational
feasibility. Instead of the underestimated gap with standard
exchange-correlation approximations and the overestimated gap with screened
hybrid functional HSE06, the band gap of the monolayer TiSe2 CDW phase
calculated by the meta-GGA MVS (151 meV) is consistent with the angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) gap of 153 meV measured at 10 K. In
addition, the gap of bulk TiSe2 CDW phase reaches 67 meV within the TASK
approximation, close to the ARPES gap of 82 meV. Regarding excitations of
many-body nature, for bulk TiSe2 in normal and CDW phases, the experimentally
observed humps of electron energy loss spectroscopy and plasmon peak are
successfully reproduced in TDDFT, without an obvious kernel dependence. To
unleash the full scientific and technological potential of CDWs in transition
metal dichalcogenides, the chemical doping, heterostructure engineering, and
pump-probe techniques are needed. Our study opens the door to simulating these
complexities in CDW compounds from first principles by revealing meta-GGAs as
an accurate low-cost alternative to HSE06.

<h3>Fermi sea and sky in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation</h3>

</p><i>Xian-Peng Zhang, Yugui Yao</i>
<p>We develop a comprehensive logical framework for effectively handling the
overcomplete basis set in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation that contains two
orthonormal basis sets conjugate with each other, such as particle and hole
orthonormal basis sets. We highlight the significant implications of our
logical framework from theoretical concepts and experimental predictions.
Firstly, we rigorously derive all many-body eigenfunctions of arbitrary
nonuniform superconductors and uncover that the many-body eigenstates are full
of superconducting spin clouds-the electron configuration within the
Cooper-like pair of an arbitrary nonuniform superconductor. Secondly, we
demonstrate a conjugate loop formed by the effective vacuum states of two
orthonormal basis sets conjugate with each other, such as the Fermi sea and
sky-the effective vacuum states of positive and negative orthonormal basis
sets, respectively. Thirdly, we present a gate-, field-, and phase-tunable
tunnel spectroscopy asymmetry arising from the imbalanced particle-hole
distribution of the subgap quasiparticles in a quantum-dot Josephson junction.
These findings underscore the power of our logical framework and its
implications for advancing our understanding and utilization of solid-state
devices based on superconductivity.

model using ultracold bosons in a tilted optical lattice. We prepare many-body
ground states of controllable system sizes and observe enhanced fluctuations
around the transition between paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states,
marking the precursor of quantum critical behavior. Furthermore, we find
evidence for superpositions of domain walls and study their effect on the
many-body ground state by measuring the populations of each spin configuration
across the transition. These results shed new light on the effect of boundary
conditions in finite-size quantum systems.

</p><i>Hikaru Watanabe, Akito Daido</i>
<p>Nonlinear optics has regained attention in recent years, especially in the
context of optospintronics and topological materials. Nonlinear responses
involved in various degrees of freedom manifest their intricacy more pronounced
than linear responses. However, for a certain class of nonlinear responses, a
connection can be established with linear-response coefficients, enabling the
exploration of diverse nonlinear-response functionality in terms of the
linear-response counterpart. Our study quantum-mechanically elucidates the
relation between such nonlinear and linear responses we call the Pitevskii
relation and identifies the condition for the relation to hold. Following the
obtained general formulation, we systematically identify the Pitaevskii
relations such as the inverse magnetoelectric effect and inverse natural
optical activity unique to systems manifesting the space-inversion-symmetry
breaking. These results provide a systematic understanding of intricate
nonlinear responses and may offer further implications to ultrafast
spintronics.

<p>We performed 23Na NMR and magnetization measurements on an S = 1, quasi-2D
honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Na3Ni2BiO6. A large positive Curie-Weiss
constant of 22.9 K is observed. The NMR spectra at low fields are consistent
with a "zigzag" magnetic order, indicating a large easy-axis anisotropy. With
field applied along the c* axis, the NMR spectra confirm the existence of a
1/3-magnetization plateau phase between 5.1 T and 7.1 T. The transition from
the zigzag order to the 1/3-magnetization plateau phase is also found to be a
first-order type. A monotonic decrease of the spin gap is revealed in the
1/3-magnetization plateau phase, which reaches zero at a quantum critical field
Hc = 8.35 T before entering the fully polarized phase. These data suggest the
existence of exchange frustration in the system along with strong ferromagnetic
interactions, hosting the possibility for Kitaev physics. Besides, well below
the ordered phase, the 1/T1 at high fields shows either a level off or an
enhancement upon cooling below 3 K, which suggests the existence of low-energy
fluctuations.

<h3>The Ideal Glass and the Ideal Disk Packing in Two Dimensions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Viola Bolton-Lum, R. Cameron Dennis, Peter Morse, Eric Corwin</i>
<p>The ideal glass, a disordered system of particles with zero configurational
entropy, cannot be realized through thermal processes. Nevertheless, we present
a method for constructing ideal jammed packings of soft spheres, and thus the
zero temperature ideal glass, in two dimensions. In line with the predicted
properties, these critically jammed packings have high bulk and shear moduli as
well as an anomalously high density. While the absence of pressure scaling in
the shear moduli of crystalline materials is often attributed to the ordered
nature of the particles, we show for the first time that disordered ideal
packings also have this feature. We also find that the density of states avoids
the low frequency power law scaling famously found in most amorphous materials.
Finally, these configurations display hyperuniformity. In addition to resolving
a long-standing mystery, this methodology represents a valuable shortcut in the
generation of well-equilibrated glassy systems. The creation of such an ideal
packing makes possible a complete exploration and explanation of two
dimensional jammed and glassy systems.

<h3>Flexible Control of Chiral Superconductivity in Optically Driven Nodal  Point Superconductors with Antiferromagnetism</h3>

</p><i>Zhen Ning, Junjie Zeng, Da-Shuai Ma, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang</i>
<p>Recent studies have attracted widespread attention on magnet-superconductor
hybrid systems with emergent topological superconductivity. Here, we present
the Floquet engineering of realistic two-dimensional topological nodal-point
superconductors that are composed of antiferromagnetic monolayers in proximity
to an s-wave superconductor. We show that Floquet chiral topological
superconductivity arises naturally due to light-induced breaking of the
effective time-reversal symmetry. More strikingly, we find that the Floquet
chiral topological superconducting phases can be flexibly controlled by
irradiating elliptically polarized light, with the photon-dressed quasi-energy
spectrum carrying different Chern numbers. Such optically switchable
topological transition is attributed to the simultaneous creations (or
annihilations) of valley pairs. Our findings provide a feasible approach for
achieving the Floquet chiral topological superconductivity with flexible
tunability, which would draw extensive attention in experiments.

</p><i>Simone Taioli, Maurizio Dapor</i>
<p>Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made
significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and
transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial
resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and
electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample
preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate
theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer
simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a
rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such
as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs,
nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and
computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur
when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single
and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the
generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the
irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio
methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion
systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in
energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for
the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative
approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and
secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and
dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of
irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological
significance.

<p>Bioinspiration has widely been demonstrated to be a powerful approach for the
design of innovative structures and devices. Recently, this concept has been
extended to the field of elasticity, dynamics, and metamaterials. In this
paper, we propose a seashell-inspired metasensor that can simultaneously
perform spatial frequency mapping and act as a polarizer. The structure emerges
from a universal parametric design that encompasses diverse spiral geometries
with varying circular cross sections and curvature radii, all leading to
tonotopic behavior. Adoption of an optimization process leads to a planar
geometry that enables us to simultaneously achieve tonotopy for orthogonally
polarized modes, leading to the possibility to control polarization as well as
the spatial distribution of frequency maxima along the spiral axis. We
demonstrate the versatility of the device and discuss the possible applications
in the field of acoustics and sensing.

<p>We present a computational study of the parametric excitation of spin waves
in thin film disks with a mode-resolved approach. The method involves
projecting out the time-dependent magnetization, computed using micromagnetics
simulations, onto the spatial profile of the eigenmodes that are obtained from
the linearization of the equations of motion. Unlike spectral analysis in the
frequency domain, the projection allows for the analysis of transient mode
dynamics under parametric excitation. We apply this method to parallel pumping
of quantized spin wave modes in in-plane magnetized thin-film disks, where
phenomena like frequency pulling, mutual phase locking, and higher-order magnon
scattering processes are identified.

<h3>Effects of phase separation on extinction times in population models</h3>

<p>We study the effect of phase separating diffusive dynamics on the mean time
to extinction in several reaction-diffusion models with slow reactions. We
consider a continuum theory similar to model AB, and a simple model where
individual particles on two sites undergo on-site reactions and hopping between
the sites. In the slow-reaction limit, we project the models' dynamics onto
suitable one-dimensional reaction coordinates, which allows derivation of
quasi-equilibrium effective free energies. For weak noise, this enables
characterisation of the mean time to extinction. This time can be enhanced or
suppressed by the addition of phase separation, compared with homogeneous
reference cases. We also discuss how Allee effects can be affected by phase
separation.

<h3>Delocalized low-frequency magnetoplasmon in a two-dimensional electron  fluid with cylindrical symmetry</h3>

<br>
</p><i>I. Kostylev, M. Hatifi, D. Konstantinov, A.D Chepelianskii</i>
<p>The properties of a two-dimensional (2D) electron system can be drastically
altered by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the 2D plane. In
particular, the frequency of its bulk collective excitations becomes gaped at
the cyclotron frequency, while the low-frequency localized excitations, the
edge magnetoplasmon (EMP), appear near the system's edge. A new type of the
delocalized low-frequency excitations, the gradient magnetoplasmon (GMP), was
recently shown to exist in a 2D electron system with a linear density gradient
that breaks the system's cylindrical symmetry [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{103},
075420 (2021)]. Like EMP, these new excitations are gapless and chiral, and
originate from the classical Hall effect. Here we show that a similar
magnetoplasmon mode can exist in a system with strongly-inhomogeneous radial
distribution of the electron density that preserves the cylindrical symmetry.
This is experimentally demonstrated in a pristine system of surface electrons
on liquid helium and is confirmed by a numerical simulation. This result
extends the variety of known collective excitations in a 2D charge system and
presents electrons on helium as a promising model system for their study.

<h3>Higher order spin interactions mediated by the substrate</h3>

</p><i>Szczepan Głodzik, Rok Žitko</i>
<p>Since the seminal works in the fifties it has been known that a bath of
non-interacting electrons mediates an interaction between local moments (such
as nuclear spins or magnetic impurities) coupled to distant sites of the
lattice. Recent efforts in simultaneous control of multi-qubit arrays relies on
defining quantum dots in environments which likewise contain electrons capable
of mediating effective interactions. It is therefore interesting to analyze
systems with more than two impurities in higher orders of perturbation theory.
Here we derive and discuss the significance of the effective spin interactions
between four impurities in fourth order of the coupling between the impurities
and the substrate, mediated by conduction electrons of a two-dimensional square
lattice. This effective interaction resembles the ring exchange - a coupling of
four spins appearing in perturbative treatment of the Hubbard model. Despite it
being a higher-order effect, it can dramatically influence the magnetic
ordering. We show that as an effective interaction between impurity spins, the
ring exchange can also compete with the more familiar two-spin interactions.

</p><i>Max Tymczyszyn, Edward McCann</i>
<p>We describe the mean-field model of a one-dimensional topological
superconductor with two orbitals per unit cell. Time-reversal symmetry is
absent, but a nonsymmorphic symmetry, involving a translation by a fraction of
the unit cell, mimics the role of time-reversal symmetry. As a result, the
topological superconductor has $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological phases, two which
support Majorana bound states and two which do not, in agreement with a
prediction based on K-theory classification [K. Shiozaki et al., Phys. Rev. B
93, 195413 (2016)]. As with the Kitaev chain, the presence of Majorana bound
states gives rise to the $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. The K-theory
classification describes two $\mathbb{Z}_4$ subclasses, but, by identifying
models in both subclasses, we show that they are related by a unitary
transformation and are equivalent.

<h3>Preservation of scalar spin chirality across a metallic spacer in  synthetic antiferromagnets with chiral interlayer interactions</h3>

<p>Chiral magnetic textures are highly attractive for the development of
spintronic devices, due to their properties to store and transport information
in an energy efficient manner. In multilayered systems, these are typically
stabilized via the interfacial intralayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI), which leads to configurations with both vector and scalar spin
chirality. Additionally, it has been recently observed that DMI may also
promote interlayer vector spin chirality, coupling spins in different magnetic
layers via non-magnetic spacer layers, an effect referred to as interlayer DMI
(IL-DMI).
Here, we present evidence of the preservation of interlayer scalar spin
chirality across the non-magnetic metallic spacer of a synthetic
antiferromagnet (SAF) with orthogonal anisotropy axes and IL-DMI. We draw this
conclusion from a combined comprehensive experimental and computational study
using scattering and imaging X-ray techniques. We find a direct relationship
between the sign of the net out-of plane orientation of one of the layers, and
the preferential in-plane vector spin chirality in the other layer after its
demagnetization. Current IL-DMI models and other mechanisms which could
potentially yield such chiral configurations fail in explaining these
experimental results. This work thus uncovers a new flavor of chiral interlayer
interactions, demanding the further development of theoretical models in order
to describe the microscopic origin of the effect.

<p>We address crystals of non-attractive colloidal spheres freely expanding into
particle-free environ-ments and melting during dilution. This problem has been
studied in two dimensions, both numeri-cally and in experiments on colloidal
model crystals. Here, we place three-dimensional drops of aqueous colloidal
charged sphere suspensions in a colloid-free, deionized aqueous environment.
Initially in a shear-molten state, they rapidly crystallize to a fine-grained
polycrystalline material of body centred cubic structure. They stabilize their
spherical shape within a few seconds. We over-come the challenges provided by
drop turbidity and use a combination of optical methods to follow the drop
evolution. The crystal ball shows a nearly fourfold increase of the volume
followed by slow shrinkage due to melting, which is nearly linear in time.
Exploiting coherent multiple-scattering by (110) Bragg reflecting crystals,
time-dependent density profiles were recorded within the drop interior. These
show a continuously flattening radial density gradient. Our experimental
situation is close to the isothermal three-dimensional expansion of a spherical
crystallite as described by a theoretical model based on dynamical density
functional theory. We obtain an overall good agree-ment of measured and
calculated expansion curves at most probed densities. We anticipate that our
study opens novel experimental and theoretical access to a long-standing
condensed matter issue.

<p>The exploration of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials has
shown great promise and interest in tuning the magnetic and electronic
properties as well as studying magneto-optical effects. The current work
investigates the control of magneto-optical interactions in alloyed MnxZn1-xPS3
lamellar semiconductor single crystals, with the Mn/Zn ratio regulating the
coupling strength. Magnetic susceptibility results show a retention of AFM
order followed by a decrease in N\'eel temperatures down to ~ 40% Mn
concentration, below which a paramagnetic behavior is observed. Absorption
measurements reveal an increase in bandgap energy with higher Zn(II)
concentration, and the presence of Mn(II) d-d transition below the absorption
edge. DFT+U approach qualitatively explained the origin and the position of the
experimentally observed mid band-gap states in pure MnPS3, and corresponding
peaks visible in the alloyed systems MnxZn1-xPS3. Accordingly, emission at 1.3
eV in all alloyed compounds results from recombination from a 4T1g Mn(II)
excited state to a hybrid p-d state at the valence band. Most significant,
temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) intensity trends demonstrate
strong magneto-optical coupling in compositions with x > 0.65. This study
underscores the potential of tailored alloy compositions as a means to control
magnetic and optical properties in 2D materials, paving the way for advances in
spin-based technologies.

<p>Run-and-tumble is a basic model of persistent motion and a motility strategy
widespread in micro-organisms and individual cells. In many natural settings,
movement occurs in the presence of confinement. While accumulation at the
surface has been extensively studied, the transport parallel to the boundary
has received less attention. We consider a run-and-tumble particle confined
inside a slit, where motion in the bulk alternates with intermittent sojourns
at the wall. We first propose a discrete-direction model that is fully
tractable and obtain the exact diffusion coefficient characterizing the
long-time exploration of the slit. We then use numerical simulations to show
that with an adequate choice of parameters, our analytical prediction provides
a useful approximation for the diffusion coefficient of run-and-tumble with
continuous direction. Finally, we identify the conditions that maximize
diffusion within the slit and discuss the optimal mean run time. For swimming
bacteria, we find that the optimum is typically reached when the mean run
length is comparable to the confinement size.

<h3>The photoinduced hidden metallic phase of monoclinic VO2 driven by local  nucleation via a self-amplification process</h3>

<p>The insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide (VO2) has
garnered extensive attention for its potential applications in ultrafast
switches, neuronal network architectures, and storage technologies. However, a
significant controversy persists regarding the formation of the IMT,
specifically concerning whether a complete structural phase transition from
monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) phase is necessary. Here we employ the real-time
time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to track the dynamic
evolution of atomic and electronic structures in photoexcited VO2, revealing
the emergence of a long-lived monoclinic metal phase (MM) under low electronic
excitation. The emergence of the metal phase in the monoclinic structure
originates from the dissociation of the local V-V dimer, driven by the
self-trapped and self-amplified dynamics of photoexcited holes, rather than by
a pure electron-electron correction. On the other hand, the M1-to-R phase
transition does appear at higher electronic excitation. Our findings validate
the existence of MM phase and provide a comprehensive picture of the IMT in
photoexcited VO2.

<p>Thermal behaviors of hydroxypropyl cellulose dilute aqueous solutions with
impurities of Group I alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs chlorides) has
been studied by means of static and dynamic light scattering measurements. From
the experimental data, it follows that at temperatures above the LCST and in
the presence of salts, there arise supramolecular associates (clusters) that
are several times larger than the wavelength of visible light. It is shown that
the observed intensity of backscattered light is described by the tangent plane
approximation and the Mie scattering theory.

<p>We investigate the possibility of characterizing the different thermalization
pathways through a large-deviation approach. Specifically, we consider clean,
disordered and quasi-periodic harmonic chains under energy and
momentum-conserving noise. For their associated master equations, describing
the dynamics of normal modes energies, we compute the fluctuations of activity
and dynamical entropy in the corresponding biased ensembles. First-order
dynamical phase transition are found that originates from different activity
regions in action space. At the transitions, the steady-state in the biased
ensembles changes from extended to localized, yielding a kind of condensation
in normal-modes space. For the disordered and quasi-periodic models, we argue
that the phase-diagram has a critical point at a finite value of the disorder
or potential strength.

the bulk of a superconducting wire, as a result of a temperature difference
applied at the ends of the wire. We find that the thermoelectric response
occurs in ranges of the angles $\theta$ which correspond to the emergence of
Bogoliubov-Fermi points in the energy spectrum of the superconducting wire.

</p><i>Robert Fuchs, Juanjuan Ren, Sebastian Franke, Stephen Hughes, Marten Richter</i>
<p>A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes
(QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for
cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using
quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical
Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a
quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is
justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this
measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a
dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large
separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity
phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the
Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous
QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a
shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell
calculations.

<p>The pressure-induced polymorphism of binary octect compounds has long been
considered a settled problem although the possible atomic disordering of some
phases remains a puzzling observation. Taking GaP as a case study, we conclude,
through x-ray microdiffraction and first-principles calculations, that its
high-pressure phase II (previously reported as being disordered) adopts in fact
an ordered base-centered monoclinic structure previously unknown in this class
of compounds. The formation of layered patterns with variable degrees of
interlayer dimerization, as observed in GaP, marks a paradigm shift of our
understanding of ordering in octect high-pressure phases which calls for a more
extensive re-examination. A rich polymorphism with fine tuning of chemical and
physical properties can be envisioned.

<p>Colloidal gels are prime examples of functional materials exhibiting
disordered, amorphous, yet meta-stable forms. They maintain stability through
short-range attractive forces and their material properties are tunable by
external forces. Combining persistent homology analyses and simulations of
three-dimensional colloidal gels doped with active particles, we reveal novel
dynamically evolving structures of colloidal gels. Specifically, we show that
the local injection of energy by active dopants can lead to highly porous, yet
compact gel structures that can significantly affect the transport of active
particles within the modified colloidal gel. We further show the substantially
distinct structural behaviour between active doping of 2D and 3D systems by
revealing how passive interfaces play a topologically different role in
interacting with active particles in two and three dimensions. The results open
the door to an unexplored prospect of forming a wide variety of compact but
highly heterogeneous and percolated porous media through active doping of 3D
passive matter, with diverse implications in designing new functional materials
to active ground remediation.

<p>The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as
SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$)
interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here,
using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory
calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO:
they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range
down to 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral
function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle
renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph
coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the
resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our
work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a
prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph
interactions in SVO.

<p>The objective of our research is to investigate the electrocatalytic
properties of novel metal-free quantum dots (QDs) composed of the recently
discovered 2D material penta-CN2, with the aim of replacing costly and scarce
catalysts such as Pt and Pd. Employing a first-principles density functional
theory (DFT) based approach, the geometries of the three penta-CN2 quantum dots
(QDs) of increasing sizes, 3 x 3, 3 x 4, 4 x 4 are optimized. Through
comprehensive analysis, our research extensively explored the structural
stability of penta-CN2 QDs, delved into their electronic properties, and
assessed their catalytic performance concerning the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
(HER). Notably, the H-adsorbed penta-CN2 QDs exhibit a significant reduction in
the HOMO-LUMO gap (E_{g}) ranging from 35% to 49% compared to the pristine QD.
Next, we investigated their catalytic performance relevant to HER, using
well-known descriptors: (i) adsorption energy, (ii) over-potential, (iii) Gibbs
free energy and (iv) exchange current density along with the volcano curve. As
far as size dependence of the catalytic performance is concerned, the value of
Delta G^{(av)} is minimum for 3 x 3 penta-CN2 QD, with those of 3 x 4 and 4 x 4
QDs being slightly larger. Our calculations predict a high value of exchange
current density 2.24 x 10^{-3} A-cm^{-2} for one of the sites (N11 for 3 x 3
QD), which we believe will lead to significantly enhanced HER properties. Our
research outcomes hold great promise in advancing the discovery of abundant,
non-toxic, and cost-effective catalysts for HER, playing a vital role in
facilitating large-scale hydrogen production.

<p>Knitted fabrics are metamaterials with remarkable mechanical properties, such
as extreme deformability and multiple history-dependent rest shapes. This
letter shows that those properties may stem from a continuous set of metastable
states for a mechanically relaxed fabric, evidenced through experiments,
numerical simulations and analytical developments. Those states arise from the
frictional contact forces acting in the braid zone where the threads interlace
and follow a line in the configuration space accurately described by a
2D-elastica model. The friction coefficient sets a terminal point along this
line, and the continuous set of relaxed states is obtained by varying the braid
inclination while contact forces remain on the friction cone.

<p>Recent advances in manipulation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) within the

(OHE) occupies a special place. Here, focusing on both the second-order
topological and quantum anomalous Hall insulators in two-dimensional
ferromagnets, we demonstrate that topological phase transitions present an
efficient and straightforward way to engineer the OHE, where the OAM
distribution can be controlled by the nature of the band inversion. Using
first-principles calculations, we identify Janus RuBrCl and three septuple
layers of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as experimentally feasible examples of the proposed

<p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body
quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and
Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal
behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from
lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls.
We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and
show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal
lattice of arbitrary generation. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is
characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the
number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. We show
that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on
the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice, the two-dimensional lattice,
and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function
of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal
dynamics.

<p>An antiferromagnet emits spin currents when time-reversal symmetry is broken.
This is typically achieved by applying an external magnetic field below and
above the spin-flop transition or by optical pumping. In this work we apply
optical pump-THz emission spectroscopy to study picosecond spin pumping from
metallic FeRh as a function of temperature. Intriguingly we find that in the
low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase the laser pulse induces a large and
coherent spin pumping, while not crossing into the ferromagnetic phase. With
temperature and magnetic field dependent measurements combined with atomistic
spin dynamics simulations we show that the antiferromagnetic spin-lattice is
destabilised by the combined action of optical pumping and picosecond
spin-biasing by the conduction electron population, which results in spin
accumulation. We propose that the amplitude of the effect is inherent to the
nature of FeRh, particularly the Rh atoms and their high spin susceptibility.
We believe that the principles shown here could be used to produce more
effective spin current emitters. Our results also corroborate the work of
others showing that the magnetic phase transition begins on a very fast
picosecond timescale, but this timescale is often hidden by measurements which
are confounded by the slower domain dynamics.

<p>Molecular dynamics simulations at a constant electric potential are an
essential tool to study electrochemical processes, providing microscopic
information on the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties. Despite
the numerous advances in the simulation of electrodes, they fail to accurately
represent the electronic structure of materials such as graphite. In this work,
we introduce a simple parameterization method that allows to tune the
metallicity of the electrode based on a quantum chemistry calculation of the
density of states. As a first illustration, we study the interface between
graphite electrodes and two different liquid electrolytes, an aqueous solution
of NaCl and a pure ionic liquid, at different applied potentials. We show that
the simulations reproduce qualitatively the experimentally-measured
capacitance; in particular, they yield a minimum of capacitance at the point of
zero charge, which is due to the quantum capacitance contribution. An analysis
of the structure of the adsorbed liquids allows to understand why the ionic
liquid displays a lower capacitance despite its large ionic concentration. In
addition to its relevance for the important class of carbonaceous electrodes,
this method can be applied to any electrode materials (e.g. 2D materials,
conducting polymers, etc), thus enabling molecular simulation studies of
complex electrochemical devices in the future.

<p>We theoretically investigate the bilinear current, scaling as $j\sim EB$, in
two- and three-dimensional systems. Based on the extended semiclassical theory,
we develop a unified theory including both longitudinal and transverse
currents. We classify all contributions according to their different scaling
relations with the relaxation time. We reveal the distinct contributions to the
ordinary Hall effect, planar Hall effect, and magnetoresistance. We further
report an intrinsic ordinary Hall current, which has a geometric origin and has
not been discussed previously. Our theory is explicitly applied to studying a
massive Dirac model and a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system. Our work presents a
general theory of electric transport under a magnetic field, potentially laying
the groundwork for future experimental studies or device fabrications.

<p>Diffusiophoretic motion induced by gradients of dissolved species has enabled
the manipulation of colloids over large distances, spanning hundreds of
microns. Nonetheless, studies have primarily focused on simple geometries that
feature 1D gradients of solutes generated by reactions or selective
dissolution. Thus, our understanding of 3D diffusiophoresis remains elusive
despite its importance in wide-ranging scenarios, such as cellular transport
and nanofluidics. Herein, we present a strategy to generate 3D chemical
gradients under electric fields. In this approach, faradaic reactions at
electrodes induce global pH gradients that drive long-range transport through
electrodiffusiophoresis. Simultaneously, the electric field induces local pH
gradients by driving the particle's double layer far from equilibrium. As a
result, while global pH gradients lead to 2D focusing away from electrodes,
local pH gradients induce aggregation in the third dimension. Resulting
interparticle interactions display a strong dependence on surface chemistry,
and particle size. Furthermore, pH gradients can be readily tuned by adjusting
the voltage and frequency of the electric field. For large P\'eclet numbers, we
observed a chemotactic-like collapse. Remarkably, such collapse occurs without
reactions at a particle's surface. By mixing particles with different sizes, we
also demonstrate the emergence of non-reciprocal interactions through
experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations. These findings suggest a wide
array of possibilities for the dynamic assembly of materials and the design of
responsive matter.

<h3>Magnetostatic bounds on stability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets</h3>

</p><i>Konstantin L. Metlov</i>
<p>Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional localized topological solitons in the
volume of a magnet. In this work, starting with a classical free energy density
of a helimagnet, an approximate variational model of hopfions is studied. The
hopfion stability regions on the uniaxial anisotropy-external magnetic field
phase diagram are computed and their evolution with increasing magnetostatic
interaction strength is considered. It is found that magnetostatic interaction
destabilizes the hopfions and, above the certain strength (relative to
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), destroys their stability completely.
Numerical estimates for this bound are provided. They can help focus the search
for materials, supporting bulk magnetic hopfions.

<h3>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body  Localisation Transition</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sthitadhi Roy</i>
<p>We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms
of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the
decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states,
resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral
decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when
the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are
studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the
ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour,
namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the
many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the
characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer
(multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition
picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these
characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits
a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears
striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.
