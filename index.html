<h3>Intermittent relaxation and avalanches in extremely persistent active  matter</h3>

We use numerical simulations to study the dynamics of dense assemblies of
self-propelled particles in the limit of extremely large, but finite,
persistence times. In this limit, the system evolves intermittently between
mechanical equilibria where active forces balance interparticle interactions.
We develop an efficient numerical strategy allowing us to resolve the
statistical properties of elastic and plastic relaxation events caused by
activity-driven fluctuations. The system relaxes via a succession of scale-free
elastic events and broadly distributed plastic events that both depend on the
system size. Correlations between plastic events lead to emergent dynamic
facilitation and heterogeneous relaxation dynamics. Our results show that
dynamical behaviour in extremely persistent active systems is qualitatively
similar to that of sheared amorphous solids, yet with some important
differences.

We investigate coupled electron-lattice dynamics in the topological insulator
Bi2Te3 with time-resolved photoemission and time-resolved x-ray diffraction. It
is well established that coherent phonons can be launched by optical
excitation, but selection rules generally restrict these modes to zone-center
wavevectors and Raman-active branches. We find that the topological surface
state couples to additional modes, including a continuum of surface-projected
bulk modes from both Raman- and infrared-branches, with possible contributions
from surface-localized modes when they exist. Our calculations show that this
surface vibrational spectrum occurs naturally as a consequence of the
translational and inversion symmetries broken at the surface, without requiring
the splitting-off of surface-localized phonon modes. The generality of this
result suggests that coherent phonon spectra are useful by providing unique
fingerprints for identifying surface states in more controversial materials.
These effects may also expand the phase space for tailoring surface state
wavefunctions via ultrafast optical excitation.

<h3>Jamming and flocking in the restricted active Potts model</h3>

We study the active Potts model with either site occupancy restriction or
on-site repulsion to explore jamming and kinetic arrest in a flocking model.
The incorporation of such volume exclusion features leads to a surprisingly
rich variety of self-organized spatial patterns. While bands and lanes of
moving particles commonly occur without or under weak volume exclusion, strong
volume exclusion along with low temperature, high activity, and large particle
density facilitates traffic jams. Through several phase diagrams, we identify
the phase boundaries separating the jammed and free-flowing phases and study
the transition between these phases which provide us with both qualitative and
quantitative predictions of how jamming might be delayed or dissolved. We
further formulate and analyze a hydrodynamic theory for the restricted APM with
that predicts various features of the microscopic model.

<h3>Boundary states of Three Dimensional Topological Order and the  Deconfined Quantum Critical Point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09754</a>
<br>
<i>Wenjie Ji, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Cenke Xu</i>

We study the boundary states of the archetypal three-dimensional topological
order, i.e. the three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code. There are three
distinct elementary types of boundary states that we will consider in this
work. In the phase diagram that includes the three elementary boundaries there
may exist a multi-critical point, which is captured by the so-called deconfined
quantum critical point (DQCP) with an "easy-axis" anisotropy. Moreover, there
is an emergent $\mathbb{Z}^d_2$ symmetry that swaps two of the boundary types,
and it becomes part of the global symmetry of the DQCP. The emergent
$\mathbb{Z}^d_2$ symmetry on the boundary is originated from a type of surface
defect in the bulk. We further find a gapped boundary with a surface
topological order that is invariant under the emergent symmetry.

<h3>Many-body-localization protection of eigenstate topological order in two  dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09775" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09775</a>

<br>
Many-body localization (MBL) has been proposed to enable and protect
topological order in all eigenstates, vastly expanding the traditional
ground-state setting. However, for the most intriguing case of two-dimensional
(2D) systems with anyons and topology-dependent degeneracies, the dense
many-body spectrum challenges studying this MBL protection numerically. Here we
use large-scale full-spectrum variational ans\"atze to demonstrate
MBL-protected topological order in the disordered 2D toric code perturbed by
magnetic fields. We show that the system has topological local integrals of
motion (tLIOMs) for magnetic field strengths below $h_c\approx0.1$ times the
toric code coupling scale. Combining tLIOMs with exact diagonalization, we also
identify high-energy topological multiplets in the dense many-body spectrum.
The phase diagram we find is consistent with toric-code and trivial MBL phases
being separated by an intervening thermal phase.

<h3>Gapped boundaries of (3+1)d topological orders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09779" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09779</a>

Given a gapped boundary of a (3+1)d topological order (TO), one can stack on
it a decoupled (2+1)d TO to get another boundary theory. Should one view these
two boundaries as "different"? A natural choice would be no. Different classes
of gapped boundaries of (3+1)d TO should be defined modulo these decoupled
(2+1)d TOs. But is this enough?
We examine the possibility of coupling the boundary of a (3+1)d TO to
additional (2+1)d TOs or fractonic systems, which leads to even more
possibilities for gapped boundaries. Typically, the bulk point-like
excitations, when touching the boundary, become excitations in the added (2+1)d
phase, while the string-like excitations in the bulk may end on the boundary
but with endpoints dressed by some other excitations in the (2+1)d phase. For a
good definition of "class" for gapped boundaries of (3+1)d TO, we choose to
quotient out the different dressings as well.
We characterize a class of gapped boundaries by the string-like excitations
that can end on the boundary, whatever their endpoints are. A concrete example
is the (3+1)d bosonic toric code. Using group cohomology and category theory,
three gapped boundaries have been found previously: rough boundary, smooth
boundary and twisted smooth boundary. We can construct many more gapped
boundaries beyond these, which all naturally fall into two classes
corresponding to whether the $m$-string can or cannot end on the boundary.
According to this classification, the previously found three boundaries are
grouped as {rough}, {smooth, twisted smooth}. For a (3+1)d TO characterized by
a finite group $G$, different classes correspond to different subgroups of $G$.
We illustrate the physical picture from various perspectives including coupled
layer construction, Walker-Wang model and field theory.

<h3>Chiral surface superconductivity in half-Heusler semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09786" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09786</a>
<br>
<i>Tilman Schwemmer, Domenico Di Sante, Jörg Schmalian, Ronny Thomale</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose the metallic and weakly dispersive surface states of half-Heusler
semimetals as a possible domain for the onset of unconventional surface
superconductivity ahead of the bulk transition. Using density functional theory
(DFT) calculations and the random phase approximation (RPA), we analyse the
surface band structure of LuPtBi and its propensity towards Cooper pair
formation induced by screened electron-electron interactions in the presence of
strong spin-orbit coupling. Over a wide range of model parameters, we find an
energetically favoured chiral superconducting condensate featuring Majorana
edge modes, while low-dimensional order parameter fluctuations trigger
time-reversal symmetry breaking to precede the superconducting transition.

<h3>Quantum lattice dynamics and their importance in superhydride clathrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09789" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09789</a>
<br>
<i>Roman Lucrezi, Eva Kogler, Simone Di Cataldo, Markus Aichhorn, Lilia Boeri, Christoph Heil</i>
<br>
<br>
Taking a detailed look at the dynamic stability of the recently predicted
BaSiH$_8$ phase [Lucrezi $\textit{et al.}$, npj Comp. Mat. 8, 119 (2022)], we
find that the inclusion of quantum ionic effects, anharmonicity, and
phonon-phonon interaction within the framework of the stochastic
self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) leads to an increase in the
critical dynamical pressure to $20\,\text{GPa}$ as compared to $5\,\text{GPa}$
in a purely harmonic treatment of classical nuclei. We identify the change in
the crystal structure due to quantum ionic effects to be the main driving force
for this increase and demonstrate that this can already be understood at the
harmonic level by considering zero-point energy corrections to the total
electronic energy of the system. Importantly, the previously determined
critical pressure of kinetic stability $p_\text{kin} = 30\,\text{GPa}$ still
poses a stricter bound for the synthesizability of BaSiH$_8$ and similar
hydride materials than the dynamical stability and therefore constitutes a more
rigorous and accurate estimate for the experimental realizability of these
structures. With respect to our methodology, we demonstrate the use of highly
accurate machine-learned interatomic potentials to access considerably larger
population sizes and supercell dimensions, enabling carefully converging and
speeding up the SSCHA calculations.

<h3>Realization of ideal flat band by rotated d-orbitals in Kagome metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09791" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09791</a>
<br>
<i>Dongwook Kim, Feng Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently there has been intense interest in Kagome metals, which are expected
to host flat bands (FBs). However, the observed FBs are non-ideal as they are
not flat over the whole 2D Brillouin zone and overlap strongly with other
bands. Most critically, the theoretical conditions for the existence of ideal
FB in Kagome metals, beyond the simplest Kagome lattice model, are unknown.
Here, based on tight-binding model analyses of the interplay between d-orbital
symmetry and underlying Kagome lattice symmetry, we establish such conditions.
We show that for a pure transition-metal (TM) Kagome lattice, only dz2 orbital
gives rise to a FB; while dxy, dx2-y2, dxz, and dyz orbitals do not. The
condition for the latter four orbitals to produce a FB is to rotate them so
that they will conform with the underlying Kagome lattice symmetry.
Interestingly, the lattice having rotated dxy (dxz) and dx2-y2 (dyz) orbitals
leads to a FB of opposite chirality sitting above and below the Dirac bands,
respectively. For intercalated TM Kagome lattices, the Kagome-hexagonal
intercalation exhibits always a FB, while the case for the Kagome-trigonal
intercalation is conditional. Another condition to isolate the FB arising from
individual d-orbitals is to increase the crystal field splitting, such as in
Kagome metals of layered metalorganic frameworks.

<h3>Two-dimensional Dirac fermions in a mass superlattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09792" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09792</a>
<br>
<i>A. De Martino, L. Dell'Anna, L. Handt, A. Miserocchi, R. Egger</i>
<br>
<br>
We study two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions in the presence of a periodic
mass term alternating between positive and negative values along one direction.
This scenario could be realized for a graphene monolayer or for the surface
states of topological insulators. The low-energy physics is governed by chiral
Jackiw-Rebbi modes propagating along zero-mass lines, with the energy
dispersion of the Bloch states given by an anisotropic Dirac cone. By means of
the transfer matrix approach, we obtain exact results for a piece-wise constant
mass superlattice. On top of Bloch states, two different classes of boundary
and/or interface modes can exist in a finite-size geometry or in a nonuniform
electrostatic potential, respectively. We compute the dispersion relation for
both types of boundary and interface modes, which originate either from states
close to the superlattice Brillouin zone (BZ) center or, via a Lifshitz
transition, from states near the BZ boundary. In the presence of a potential
step, we predict that the interface modes, the Bloch wave functions, and the
electrical conductance will sensitively depend on the step position relative to
the mass superlattice.

<h3>Machine learning assisted derivation of effective low energy models for  metallic magnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Vikram Sharma, Zhentao Wang, Cristian D. Batista</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the problem of extracting an effective low-energy spin model from
a Kondo Lattice Model (KLM) with classical localized moments. The non-analytic
dependence of the effective spin-spin interactions on the Kondo exchange $J$
excludes the possibility of using perturbation theory beyond the second order
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction at zero temperature. Here we
introduce a Machine Learning (ML) assisted protocol to extract effective two-
and four-spin interactions by integrating out the conduction electrons of the
original KLM. The resulting effective spin model reproduces the phase diagram
obtained with the original KLM as a function of magnetic field and easy-axis
anisotropy and reveals the effective four-spin interactions that are
responsible for the field induced skyrmion crystal phase. Moreover, this
minimal spin model enables an efficient computation of static and dynamical
properties with a much lower numerical cost relative to the original KLM. A
comparison of the dynamical spin structure factor in the fully polarized phase
computed with the effective model and the original KLM reveals a good agreement
for the magnon dispersion despite the fact that this information was not
included in the training data set.

<h3>Disentangling Interacting Systems with Fermionic Gaussian Circuits:  Application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09798" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09798</a>

<br>
<br>
Tensor network representations of quantum many-body states provide powerful
tools for strongly correlated systems, tailored to capture local correlations
such as ground states exhibiting entanglement area laws. When applying tensor
network states to interacting fermionic systems, a proper choice of basis or
orbitals can greatly reduce the bond dimension of tensors and speed up
calculations. We introduce such a change of basis with unitary gates obtained
via compressing fermionic Gaussian states into quantum circuits corresponding
to various tensor networks. These circuits can reduce the ground state
entanglement entropy and improve the performance of algorithms such as the
density matrix renormalization group. We study the 1D single impurity Anderson
model to show the power of the method in improving computational efficiency and
interpreting impurity physics. Furthermore, fermionic Gaussian circuits also
show potential for suppressing entanglement during the time evolution of a
low-lying excited state that is used to compute the impurity Green's function.
Lastly, we consider Gaussian multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz
(GMERA) circuits which compress fermionic Gaussian states hierarchically. The
emergent coarse-grained physical models from these GMERA circuits are studied
in terms of their entanglement properties and suitability for performing time
evolution.

<h3>Topological Dimensions from Disorder and Quantum Mechanics?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09806" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09806</a>

<br>
<br>
We have recently shown that critical Anderson electron in $D=3$ dimensions
effectively occupies a spatial region of infrared (IR) scaling dimension
$d_\text{IR} \approx 8/3$. Here we inquire about the dimensional substructure
involved. We partition space into regions of equal quantum occurrence
probability, such that points comprising a region are of similar relevance, and
calculate the IR scaling dimension $d$ of each. This allows us to infer the
probability density $p(d)$ for dimension $d$ to be accessed by electron. We
find that $p(d)$ has a strong peak at $d$ very close to 2. In fact, our data
suggests that $p(d)$ is non-zero on the interval $[d_\text{min}, d_\text{max}]
\approx [4/3,8/3]$ and may develop a discrete part ($\delta$-function) at $d=2$
in infinite-volume limit. The latter invokes the possibility that combination
of quantum mechanics and pure disorder can lead to emergence of topological
dimensions. Although $d_\text{IR}$ is based on effective counting of which
$p(d)$ has no a priori knowledge, $d_\text{IR} \ge d_\text{max}$ is an exact
feature of the ensuing formalism. Possible connection of our results to recent
findings of $d_\text{IR} \approx 2$ in Dirac near-zero modes of thermal quantum
chromodynamics is emphasized.

<h3>Electronic structures near unmovable nodal points and lines in  two-dimensional materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09834" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09834</a>
<br>
<i>V. Damljanovic, N. Lazic</i>
<br>
<br>
Unmovable nodal points (UNP) and lines (UNL) are band crossings which
positions in the Brillouin zone are unaltered by symmetry preserving
perturbations. Not only positions but also the band structure in the vicinity
is determined by the little group of a wave vector and it's irreducible
(co)representations. In this paper we give the full set of electronic
dispersions near all UNPs and UNLs in non-magnetic, quasi two-dimensional (2D)
materials both with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Analysis of all
layer gray single and double groups gives nineteen different quasiparticles,
great majority of which are unavoidable for a 2D material which belongs to
certain layer groups. These include Weyl and Dirac nodal lines, dispersions
with quadratic or cubic splitting, anisotropic Weyl and Dirac cones which
orientation can be varied by e.g. strain etc. We indicated qusiparticles that
are robust to SOC. For convenience, our results are concisely presented
graphically - as a map, not in a tabular, encyclopedia form. They may be of use
as checkpoints or for fitting of experimentally (via e.g. ARPES) and
numerically obtained electronic band structures as well as for deeper
theoretical investigations.

<h3>Measuring topological entanglement entropy using Maxwell relations</h3>

Topological entanglement entropy (TEE) is a key diagnostic of topological
order, allowing to detect the presence of Abelian or non-Abelian anyons.
However, there are currently no protocols to measure TEE in condensed matter
systems. Here, we propose a scheme to measure the TEE, based on a nontrivial
connection with the thermodynamic entropy change occurring in a quantum point
contact (QPC) as it pinches off the topological liquid into two. We show how
this entropy change can be extracted using Maxwell relations from charge
detection of a nearby quantum dot. We demonstrate this explicitly for the
Abelian Laughlin states, using an exact solution of the sine-Gordon model
describing the universal crossover in the QPC. Our approach might open a new
thermodynamic detection scheme of topological states also with non-Abelian
statistics.

The growth of controlled 1D carbon-based nanostructures on metal surfaces is
a multistep process whose path, activation energies and intermediate metastable
states strongly depend on the employed substrate. Whereas this process has been
extensively studied on gold, less work has been dedicated to silver surfaces,
which have a rather different catalytic activity. In this work, we present an
experimental and theoretical investigation of the growth of poly-$p$-phenylene
(PPP) chains and subsequent narrow graphene ribbons starting from
4,4''-dibromo-$p$-terphenyl molecular precursors deposited at the silver
surface. By combing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging and density
functional theory (DFT) simulations, we describe the molecular morphology and
organization at different steps of the growth process and we discuss the
stability and conversion of the encountered species on the basis of calculated
thermodynamic quantities. Unlike the case of gold, at the debromination step we
observe the appearance of organometallic molecules and chains, which can be
explained by their negative formation energy in the presence of a silver adatom
reservoir. At the dehydrogenation temperature the persistence of intercalated
Br atoms hinders the formation of well-structured graphene ribbons, which are
instead observed on gold, leading only to a partial lateral coupling of the PPP
chains. We numerically derive very different activation energies for Br
desorption from the Ag and Au surfaces, thereby confirming the importance of
this process in defining the kinetics of the formation of molecular chains and
graphene ribbons on different metal surfaces.

<h3>Band structures of (NbSe$_4$)$_3$I and (TaSe$_4$)$_3$I: Reconciling  transport, optics and ARPES</h3>

Among the quasi one-dimensional transition metal tetrachalcogenides
(MSe$_4$)$_n$I (M=Nb,Ta), the $n=3$ compounds are the only ones not displaying
charge density waves. Instead, they show structural transitions with puzzling
transport behavior. They are semiconductors at the lowest temperatures, but
their transport gaps are significantly smaller than those inferred from ARPES
and optical conductivity. Recently, a metallic polytype of (TaSe$_4$)$_3$I has
been found with ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexisting at low
temperature, in contrast to previous reports. In this work we present detailed
ab-initio and tight binding band structure calculations for the different
(MSe$_4$)$_n$I reported structures. We obtain good agreement with the observed
transport gaps, and explain how ARPES and optics experiments effectively probe
a gap between different bands due to an approximate translation symmetry,
solving the controversy. Finally, we show how small extrinsic hole doping can
tune the Fermi level through a Van Hove singularity in (TaSe$_4$)$_3$I and
discuss the implications for magnetism and superconductivity.

<h3>Random Close Packing is least random in three dimensions</h3>

A simple dynamical model, Biased Random Organization, BRO, appears to produce
the ensemble of configurations known as Random Close Packed (RCP) as its
critical endpoint in dimension d=3. We conjecture that BRO likewise produces
RCP in any dimension and come to the following conclusions: there is no RCP in
d=1 or d=2 (where dynamics lead to crystalline order); in d=3, d=4, and d=5, we
recover RCP behavior with previously estimated packing fractions 0.64, 0.45,
and 0.30 respectively, and the systems are isostatic with average contact
numbers 6, 8, and 10. BRO belongs to the Manna universality class of dynamical
phase transitions, which has well-defined critical exponents and an upper
critical dimension of 4. Exponents are mean field for $4 \le d \le \infty$,
which we confirm in simulations. Further, a hyperscaling relation between the
correlation function exponent and density fluctuations implies that when mean
field exponents hold, density fluctuations are random and not hyperuniform.
Hence, hyperuniformity in RCP is only observed in d=3.

Mesogens, which are typically stiff rodlike or disklike molecules, are able
to self-organize into liquid crystal (LC) phases in a certain temperature
range. Such mesogens, or LC groups, can be attached to polymer chains in
various configurations including within the backbone (main-chain LC polymers)
or at the ends of side-chains attached to the backbone in an end-on or side-on
configuration (side-chain LC polymers or SCLCPs), which can display synergistic
properties arising from both their LC and polymeric character. At lower
temperatures, chain conformations may be significantly altered due to the
mesoscale LC ordering, thus, when heating from the LC ordered state through the
LC to isotropic phase transition, the chains return from a more stretched to a
more random coil conformation. This can cause macroscopic shape changes, which
depend significantly on the type of LC attachment and other architectural
properties of the polymer. Here, to study the structure-property relationships
for SCLCPs with a range of different architectures, we develop a coarse-grained
model that includes torsional potentials along with LC interactions of a
Gay--Berne form. We create systems of different side chain lengths, chain
stiffnesses, and LC attachment types, and track their structural properties as
a function of temperature. Our modeled systems indeed form a variety of
well-organized mesophase structures at low temperatures, and we predict higher
LC to isotropic transition temperatures for the end-on side-chain systems than
for analogous side-on side-chain systems. Understanding these phase transitions
and their dependence on polymer architecture can be useful in designing
materials with reversible and controllable deformations.

Scientific research can bring about important progress in developing
renewable energy technology such as solar cells. However, in addition to
positive impact, research also comes at a cost, and one such cost is the
\ce{CO2} footprint associated with doing research and producing technologies.
Here, as an example of such a cost, I estimate the associated greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions associated with my PhD, in which I researched computational and
experimental design of thin film materials for photovoltaics. I consider
supercomputer power, synchrotron beam time, laboratory synthesis and
characterization, travel associated with research, and personal emissions over
the course of my PhD. This analysis demonstrates that doing science increases
my carbon footprint to much higher than an average American. Because our
consumption is so high, scientists have a moral imperative to reduce our own
emissions in our laboratories and in the technologies we create.

Spin liquid crystals are magnetic analogs of liquid crystals, possessing
properties of both liquids and solids, a typical example of which are spin
nematics. Spin nematics share many features with spin liquids, and the
interplay between them is a promising, but little explored, route to uncovering
new phases of matter. Here, we address this question in the context of a
spin-$1$ magnet on the honeycomb lattice, by considering a model with both
biquadratic interactions, favouring spin-nematic states, and Kitaev-like
interactions, supporting spin liquids. Accompanying these, where dipole and
quadrupole moments compete, we find a plethora of exotic phases, including
multiple-$q$ states with nonzero scalar spin chirality; a quasi-one-dimensional
coplanar phase; a twisted conical phase; and a noncoplanar order state which
gives way to a chiral spin liquid at finite temperature. The implication of
these results for experiment is discussed.

Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising strategy for large-scale clean
energy production. However, efficient and low-cost solid-state photocatalysts
are still lacking. We present here first-principles calculations to investigate
the suitability as photocathode of an epitaxial layer of strontium germanate on
a Si(100) single crystal. Conduction and valence bands offsets at the interface
between these two semiconductors were determined using state-of-the-art
approximations of density functional theory for the accurate prediction of band
alignments. The resulting type-III band line-up is also confirmed by inspection
of the spatially resolved density of states. It is concluded that the
electronic structure of the investigated heterostructure is favorable for
photocathodic functionality.

<br>
<br>
Quantum materials are driving a technology revolution in sensing,
communication, and computing, while simultaneously testing many core theories
of the past century. Materials such as topological insulators, complex oxides,
quantum dots, color center hosting semiconductors, and other types of strongly
correlated materials can exhibit exotic properties such as edge conductivity,
multiferroicity, magnetoresistance, single photon emission, and optical-spin
locking. These emergent properties arise and depend strongly on the materials
detailed atomic scale structure, including atomic defects, dopants, and lattice
stacking. In this review, after introduction of different classes of quantum
materials and quantum excitations, we describe how progress in the field of
electron microscopy, including in situ and in operando EM, can accelerate
advances in quantum materials. Our review describes EM methods including: i)
principles and operation modes of EM, ii) EM spectroscopies, such as electron
energy loss spectroscopy, cathodoluminescence, and electron energy gain
spectroscopy, iii) 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, iv) dynamic
and ultrafast EM, v) complimentary ultrafast spectroscopies, and vi) atomic
electron tomography. We discuss how these methods inform structure function
relations in quantum materials down to the picometer scale and femtosecond time
resolution, and how they enable high resolution manipulation of quantum
materials. Among numerous results, our review highlights how EM has enabled
identification of the 3D structure of quantum defects, measuring reversible and
metastable dynamics of quantum excitations, mapping exciton states and single
photon emission, measuring nanoscale thermal transport and coupled excitation
dynamics, and measuring the internal electric field of quantum
heterointerfaces, all at the quantum materials intrinsic atomic and near
atomic-length scale.

<h3>Mechano-self-regulation of bacterial size in growing colonies</h3>

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that biomechanical forcing plays an important role as the
driving force behind the dynamical self-regulation of cell size (or length) in
growing bacterial colonies. In our experiments, the measured elongation rate
decreases over time and depends on the areal packing density around each cell.
To describe this phenomenon theoretically, we devise a cell-resolved model
which includes as its key ingredient a force opposed to the growth process,
accounting for mechano-self-regulation. Our model is analyzed analytically by a
coarse-grained dynamical density functional theory and solved by cell-based
computer simulations to predict how the strength of mechano-self-regulation
depends on the bacterial size, the location in the colony and the local
environment. The microscopic nature of this approach allows to quantify the
effect of biomechanical interactions on the structure, composition and
dynamical features of growing bacterial colonies.

<h3>Bridging necking and shear-banding mediated tensile failure in glasses</h3>

<br>
<i>David Richard, Ethen Lund, Jan Schroers, Eran Bouchbinder</i>
<br>
<br>
The transition between necking-mediated tensile failure of glasses, at
elevated temperatures and/or low strain-rates, and shear-banding-mediated
tensile failure, at low temperatures and/or high strain-rates, is investigated
using tensile experiments on metallic glasses and atomistic simulations. We
experimentally and simulationally show that this transition occurs through a
sequence of macroscopic failure patterns, parametrized by the ultimate tensile
strength. Quantitatively analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics preceding
failure, using large scale atomistic simulations corroborated by experimental
fractography, reveals how the collective evolution and mutual interaction of
shear-driven plasticity and dilation-driven void formation (cavitation) control
the various macroscopic failure modes. In particular, we find that at global
failure, the size of the largest cavity in the loading direction exhibits a
nonmonotonic dependence on the temperature at a fixed strain rate, which is
rationalized in terms of the interplay between shear- and dilation-driven
plasticity. We also find that the size of the largest cavity scales with the
cross-sectional area of the undeformed sample. These results shed light on
tensile failure of glasses, and highlight the need to develop elasto-plastic
constitutive models of glasses incorporating both shear- and dilation-driven
irreversible processes.

Oxide heterostructures have repeatedly been shown to display apical
properties at the interfaces, some of which favorable to the formation of
two-dimensional electron systems, as well as high transition temperature
superconductivity. In this study, we propose a novel heterostructure to
potentially achieve near room-temperature superconductivity, via the carrier
injection in cuprate interfaces with ferro-electrics. Using a digital design
approach guided by density-functional theory, the systems of XTiO3/XCuO3/XTiO3
are thoroughly examined, confirming the formation of a two-dimensional electron
gas at the cuprous oxide interface. Via the manipulation of lattice parameters,
the key ingredients for two-dimensional electron gas formation is explored. We
apply cluster dynamical mean-field theory on the cuprous oxide plane and probe
the superconducting properties of the system XTiO3/XCuO3/XTiO3 . As a result,
we see a marked increase of superconducting ordering parameter near the fully
occupied regime, a known marker for the superconducting transition temperature.

<h3>Shear-Strain Controlled High-Harmonic Generation in Graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a novel method for controlling the high-harmonic generation (HHG)
with a high dynamic range in single-layer graphene. We find that, by utilizing
shear strain, a significant enhancement or quenching of HHG is possible over a
range of several orders of magnitude. This feature is made possible by the
resonance mechanism at a van Hove singularity. Therein, the shear strain
controls the configurations of the two Dirac cones, resulting in changes in the
energy and dipole moment at the saddle point of the band dispersion. Our
findings provide a way for modulating or switching light by using a
nano-optomechanical device composed of single-layer graphene.

We investigate the stationary vortex solutions in two-dimensional (2D) Rashba
spin-orbit (SO) coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By introducing
the generalized momentum operator, the linear version of the system can be
solved exactly and its solutions are a set of the Bessel vortices. Based on the
linear version solutions, the stationary vortex solutions of the full nonlinear
system are constructed and determined entirely by the variational
approximation. The results show that the variational results are in good
agreement with the numerical ones. By means of the variational results, the
vortex ground state phase-transition between the stationary vortex solutions,
stability, and the unit Bloch vector textures are discussed in detail. The
results have the potential to be realized in experiment.

<br>
<br>
We study ultrafast population dynamics in the topological surface state of
Sb$_2$Te$_3$ in two-dimensional momentum space with time- and angle-resolved
two-photon photoemission. Linear polarized mid-infrared pump pulses are used to
permit a direct optical excitation across the Dirac point. We show that this
resonant excitation is strongly enhanced within the Dirac cone along three of
the six $\bar{\Gamma}$-$\bar{M}$ directions and results in a macroscopic
photocurrent when the plane of incidence is aligned along a
$\bar{\Gamma}$-$\bar{K}$ direction. Our experimental approach makes it possible
to disentangle the decay of transiently excited population and photocurent by
elastic and inelastic electron scattering within the full Dirac cone in
unprecedented detail. This is utilized to show that doping of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ by
vanadium atoms strongly enhances inelastic electron scattering to lower
energies, but only scarcely affects elastic scattering around the Dirac cone.

<h3>Wafer-Scale Fabrication of Hierarchically Porous Silicon and Silica  Glass by Active Nanoparticle-Assisted Chemical Etching and Pseudomorphic  Thermal Oxidation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Many biological materials exhibit a multiscale porosity with small, mostly
nanoscale pores as well as large, macroscopic capillaries to simultaneously
achieve optimized mass transport capabilities and lightweight structures with
large inner surfaces. Realizing such a hierarchical porosity in artificial
materials necessitates often sophisticated and expensive top-down processing
that limits scalability. Here we present an approach that combines
self-organized porosity based on metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) with
photolithographically induced macroporosity for the synthesis of
single-crystalline silicon with a bimodal pore-size distribution, i.e.,
hexagonally arranged cylindrical macropores with 1 micrometer diameter
separated by walls that are traversed by mesopores 60 nm across. The MACE
process is mainly guided by a metal-catalyzed reduction-oxidation reaction,
where silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) serve as the catalyst. In this process, the
AgNPs act as self-propelled particles that are constantly removing silicon
along their trajectories. High-resolution X-ray imaging and electron tomography
reveal a resulting large open porosity and inner surface for potential
applications in high-performance energy storage, harvesting and conversion or
for on-chip sensorics and actuorics. Finally, the hierarchically porous silicon
membranes can be transformed structure-conserving by thermal oxidation into
hierarchically porous amorphous silica, a material that could be of particular
interest for opto-fluidic and (bio-)photonic applications due to its multiscale
artificial vascularization.

We realize a device, based on InAs two-dimensional electron gas proximitized
by superconducting Al, which allows a single quantum dot level to be used as a
spectrometer of the density of states in a nanowire. Applying a magnetic field
parallel to the plane of the device causes the levels of the dot to split,
enabling spin resolved spectroscopy. Using this method, we are able to study
the spin and charge polarization of the allowed transport through sub-gap
states which form in the nanowire and evolve with varying magnetic field and
gate voltage.

<br>
<br>
Square-root topology describes models whose topological properties can be
revealed upon squaring the Hamiltonian, which produces their respective parent
topological insulators. This concept has recently been generalized to
$2^n$-root topology, characterizing models where $n$ squaring operations must
be applied to the Hamiltonian in order to arrive at the topological source of
the model. In this paper, we analyze the Hofstadter regime of
quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) and two-dimensional (2D) $2^n$-root models,
the latter of which has the square lattice (SL) (known for the Hofstadter
Butterfly) as the source model. We show that upon increasing the root-degree of
the model, there appear multiple magnetic flux insensitive flat bands, and
analytically determine corresponding eigenstates. These can be recast as
compact localized states (CLSs) occupying a finite region of the lattice. For a
finite flux, these CLSs correspond to different harmonics contained within the
same Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage. Furthermore, as the root-degree increases, a
kaleidoscope of butterflies is seen to appear in the Hofstadter diagram, with
each butterfly constituting a topologically equivalent replica of the original
one of the SL. As such, the index $n$, which uniquely identifies the
root-degree of the model, can be seen as an additional fractal dimension of the
$2^n$-root model present in its Hofstadter diagram. We discuss how these
dynamics could be realized in experiments with ultracold atoms, and measured by
Bragg spectroscopy or through observing dynamics of initially localized atoms
in a quantum gas microscope.

<br>
<br>
In recent years, interest in expanding from 2D to 3D systems has grown in the
magnetism community, from exploring new geometries to broadening the knowledge
on the magnetic textures present in thick samples, and with this arise the need
for new characterization techniques, in particular tomographic imaging. Here,
we present a new tomographic technique based on Fourier transform holography, a
lensless imaging technique that uses a known reference in the sample to
retrieve the object of interest from its diffraction pattern in one single step
of calculation, overcoming the phase problem inherent to reciprocal-space-based
techniques. Moreover, by exploiting the phase contrast instead of the
absorption contrast, thicker samples can be investigated. We obtain a 3D
full-vectorial image of a 800 nm-thick extended Fe/Gd multilayer in a
5$\mu$m-diameter circular field of view with a resolution of approximately 80
nm. The 3D image reveals worm-like domains with magnetization pointing mostly
out of plane near the surface of the sample but that falls in-plane near the
substrate. Since the FTH setup is fairly simple, it allows modifying the sample
environment. Therefore, this technique could enable in particular a 3D view of
the magnetic configuration's response to an external magnetic field.

Cavity optomechanical systems are a paradigmatic setting for the conversion
of electromagnetic energy into mechanical work. Experiments with atoms coupled
to cavity modes are realized in nonequilibrium conditions, described by
phenomenological models encoding non-thermal dissipative dynamics and falling
outside the framework of weak system-bath couplings. This fact makes their
interpretation as quantum engines, e.g., the derivation of a well-defined
efficiency, quite challenging. Here, we present a consistent thermodynamic
description of open quantum cavity-atom systems. Our approach takes advantage
of their nonequilibrium nature and arrives at an energetic balance which is
fully interpretable in terms of persistent dissipated heat currents. The
interaction between atoms and cavity modes can further give rise to
nonequilibrium phase transitions and emergent behavior and allows to assess the
impact of collective many-body phenomena on the engine operation. To enable
this, we define two thermodynamic limits related to a weak and to a strong
optomechanical coupling, respectively. We illustrate our ideas focussing on a
time-crystal engine and discuss power generation, energy-conversion efficiency,
and emergence of metastable behavior in both limits.

<i>Thomas J. Longo, Sergey V. Buldyrev, Mikhail A. Anisimov, Frederic Caupin</i>
<br>
<br>
It has been hypothesized that liquid polyamorphism, the existence of multiple
amorphous states in a single component substance, may be caused by molecular or
supramolecular interconversion. A simple microscopic model [Caupin and
Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett., 127, 185701, (2021)] introduces interconversion in
a compressible binary lattice to generate various thermodynamic scenarios for
fluids that exhibit liquid polyamorphism and/or water-like anomalies. Using
this model, we demonstrate the dramatic effects of interconversion on the
interfacial properties. In particular, we find that the liquid-vapor surface
tension exhibits either an inflection point or two extrema in its temperature
dependence. Correspondingly, we observe anomalous behavior of the interfacial
thickness and a significant shift in the concentration with respect to the
density profile.

We experimentally and theoretically study a driven hybrid circuit quantum
electrodynamics (cQED) system beyond the dispersive coupling regime. Treating
the cavity as part of the driven system, we develop a theory applicable to such
strongly coupled and to multi-qubit systems. The fringes measured for a single
driven double quantum dot (DQD)-cavity setting and the enlarged splittings of
the hybrid Floquet states in the presence of a second DQD are well reproduced
with our model. This opens a path to study Floquet states of multi-qubit
systems with arbitrarily strong coupling and reveals a new perspective for
understanding strongly driven hybrid systems.

Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) is two graphene layers placed on top of each
other with a twist angle, making it has tunable thermal properties. In this
paper, we report an analysis of thermal conductivity ($\kappa$), phonon density
of states, and specific heat capacity of tBLG with various twist angles over a
range of temperatures using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on
the Green-Kubo method. Simulation shows that stacking and twisting graphene
layers lead to a decrease in the thermal conductivity, with the highest
$\kappa$ at around room temperature owned by the tBLG with a twist angle of
3.89$^{\circ}$ followed by 16.43$^{\circ}$ and 4.41$^{\circ}$. We also perform
quantum correction to the simulation results to show the process of increasing
thermal conductivity at low temperatures.

We utilize cavity-enhanced extinction spectroscopy to directly quantify the
optical absorption of defects in MoS$_2$ generated by helium ion bombardment.
We achieve hyperspectral imaging of specific defect patterns with a detection

below $10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. The corresponding spectra reveal a broad sub-gap
absorption, being consistent with theoretical predictions related to sulfur

extinction spectroscopy as efficient means for the detection of optical
transitions in nanoscale thin films with weak absorption, applicable to a broad

<br>
<br>
A semiconductor nanowire brought in proximity to a superconductor can form
discrete, particle-hole symmetric states, known as Andreev bound states (ABSs).
An ABS can be found in its ground or excited states of different spin and
parity, such as a spin-zero singlet state with an even number of electrons or a
spin-1/2 doublet state with an odd number of electrons. Considering the
difference between spin of the even and odd states, spin-filtered measurements
have the potential to reveal the underlying ground state. To directly measure
the spin of single-electron excitations, we probe an ABS using a spin-polarized
quantum dot that acts as a bipolar spin filter, in combination with a
non-polarized tunnel junction in a three-terminal circuit. We observe a
spin-polarized excitation spectrum of the ABS, which in some cases is fully
spin-polarized, despite the presence of strong spin-orbit interaction in the
InSb nanowires. In addition, decoupling the hybrid from the normal lead blocks
the ABS relaxation resulting in a current blockade where the ABS is trapped in
an excited state. Spin-polarized spectroscopy of hybrid nanowire devices, as
demonstrated here, is proposed as an experimental tool to support the
observation of topological superconductivity.

The local optima network model has proved useful in the past in connection
with combinatorial optimization problems. Here we examine its extension to the
real continuous function domain. Through a sampling process, the model builds a
weighted directed graph which captures the function's minima basin structure
and its interconnection and which can be easily manipulated with the help of
complex networks metrics. We show that the model provides a complementary view
of function spaces that is easier to analyze and visualize, especially at
higher dimension. In particular, we show that function hardness as represented
by algorithm performance, is strongly related to several graph properties of
the corresponding local optima network, opening the way for a classification of
problem difficulty according to the corresponding graph structure and with
possible extensions in the design of better metaheuristic approaches.

Silicon vacancies in silicon carbide (SiC) have been proposed as interesting
candidates for quantum technology applications such as quantum sensing and
quantum repeaters. SiC exists in many polytypes with different plane stacking
sequences, and in each polytype, the vacancies can occupy a variety of
different lattice sites. In this work, we characterize and identify the three
most important charged silicon vacancies in the 6H-SiC polytype. We record the
photoluminescence and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance
spectra at different radio-frequency power levels and different temperatures.
We individually select the zero-phonon lines of the different silicon vacancies
at low temperatures and record the corresponding optically detected magnetic
resonance (ODMR) spectra. ODMR allows us to correlate optical and magnetic
resonance spectra and thereby resolve a controversy from earlier work.

Using the tight-binding approach, we investigate the thermoelectric (TE)
properties of rectangular phosphorene nanorings for both symmetrically and
asymmetrically attaching to phosphorene nanoribbon leads. We design our
phosphorene-based nanostructures to enhance the TE performance in the absence
and the presence of perpendicular magnetic fields. Our results show that when
zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons (ZPNRs) are coupled symmetrically to rectangular
rings, a comparatively large band gap is induced in the electronic conductance
due to the suppression of the contribution of edge states. This gives rise to a
remarkable increase in the thermopower response compared to the case of
pristine ZPNRs. More intriguingly, we found that though the maximum power
factor in this system is about the same as the one for its ZPNR counterpart,
the much smaller electronic thermal conductance of this phosphorene-based
nanostructure can remarkably contribute to the improvement of the figure of
merit. Also, we found that the symmetry/asymmetry of our designed
nanostructures, the geometrical characteristics of the ring, and the magnetic
flux are three important factors that control the thermoelectric properties of
phosphorene quantum rings. Our numerical calculations show that by changing the
magnetic flux through the nanoring, a drastic increase in the thermopower is
observed near an antiresonance point. We demonstrate the tunability of the
thermopower and the possibility to switch on and off the TE response of
phosphorene nanorings with the magnetic flux. Moreover, for asymmetric
connection configurations with armchair-edged leads, we found that though the
thermopower is almost intact, a remarkable reduction of the electronic thermal
conductance can lead to a notable improvement in the figure of merit. Our
results suggest phosphorene nanorings as promising candidate nanostructures for
TE applications.

Weak hydrogen bonds, such as O-H$\cdots\pi$ and C-H$\cdots$O, are pivotal in
a wide range of important natural and industrial processes including
biochemical assembly, molecular recognition, and chemical selectivity. In this
study we use neutron diffraction in conjunction with comprehensive H/D isotopic
substitution to obtain a detailed spatial and orientational picture of the
structure in benzene-methanol solution. This system provides us with a
prototypical situation where the aromatic ring can act as an hydrogen bond
acceptor (via the $\pi$ electron density) and/or a hydrogen bond donor (via the
CH groups), with the potential for cooperative effects. Our analysis places
benzene at the centre of our frame-of-reference, and reveals for the first time
that in solution the O-H$\cdots\pi$ interaction is highly localised and
directional, the hydrogen atom being located directly above/below the ring
centroid at a distance of 2.30 {\AA} and with the hydroxyl bond axis normal to
the aromatic plane. The tendency of methanol to form chain and cyclic motifs in
the bulk liquid is manifest in a highly templated, symmetrical equatorial
solvation structure; the methanol molecules surround the benzene so that the
O-H bonds are coplanar with the aromatic ring while the oxygens interact with
C-H groups through simultaneous bifurcated hydrogen bonds. By contrast,
C-H$\cdots\pi$ interactions are relegated to the role of more distant
spectators. The experimentally observed solvation therefore demonstrates that
weak hydrogen bonding can give rise to strongly-ordered cooperative structural
motifs also in the liquid phase.

Data-driven models are central to scientific discovery. In efforts to achieve
state-of-the-art model accuracy, researchers are employing increasingly complex
machine learning algorithms that often outperform simple regressions in
interpolative settings (e.g. random k-fold cross-validation) but suffer from
poor extrapolation performance, portability, and human interpretability, which
limits their potential for facilitating novel scientific insight. Here we
examine the trade-off between model performance and interpretability across a
broad range of science and engineering problems with an emphasis on materials
science datasets. We compare the performance of black box random forest and
neural network machine learning algorithms to that of single-feature linear
regressions which are fitted using interpretable input features discovered by a
simple random search algorithm. For interpolation problems, the average
prediction errors of linear regressions were twice as high as those of black
box models. Remarkably, when prediction tasks required extrapolation, linear
models yielded average error only 5% higher than that of black box models, and
outperformed black box models in roughly 40% of the tested prediction tasks,
which suggests that they may be desirable over complex algorithms in many
extrapolation problems because of their superior interpretability,
computational overhead, and ease of use. The results challenge the common
assumption that extrapolative models for scientific machine learning are
constrained by an inherent trade-off between performance and interpretability.

Microwave absorption spectra of a single square of two-dimensional electrons
(2DES) have been investigated using an optical detection technique. Fundamental
dipole and harmonic quadrupole plasmon modes have been identified and compared
to those in the disk geometry. In the square-shaped 2DES, a strong interaction
is discovered between the neighboring plasmon modes, whereas no such
hybridization is observed in the disk-shaped geometry. We establish a rigid
theoretical platform to analytically describe the magneto-optical response of
confined two-dimensional systems. The developed theory provides a proper
description of the obtained experimental results.

<h3>Effect of antifluorite layer on the magnetic order in Eu-based 1111  compounds, EuTAsF (T = Zn, Mn, and Fe)</h3>

<br>
<br>
The 1111 compounds with an alternating sequence of fluorite and antifluorite
layers serve as structural hosts for the vast family of Fe-based
superconductors. Here, we use neutron powder diffraction and
density-functional-theory (DFT) band-structure calculations to study magnetic
order of Eu2+ in the [EuF]+ fluorite layers depending on the nature of the
[TAs]- antifluorite layer that can be non-magnetic semiconducting (T = Zn),
magnetic semiconducting (T = Mn), or magnetic metallic (T = Fe).
Antiferromagnetic transitions at TN ~ 2.4 - 3 K due to an ordering of the Eu2+
magnetic moments were confirmed in all three EuTAsF compounds. Whereas in
EuTAsF (T = Zn and Mn), the commensurate k1 = (1/2 1/2 0) stripe order pattern
with magnetic moments within the ab-plane is observed, the order in EuFeAsF is
incommensurate with k = (0 0.961(1) 1/2) and represents a cycloid of Eu2+
magnetic moments confined within the bc-plane. Additionally, the Mn2+
sublattice in EuMnAsF features a robust G-type antiferromagnetic order that
persists at least up to room temperature, with magnetic moments along the
c-direction. Although DFT calculations suggest stripe antiferromagnetic order
in the Fe-sublattice of EuFeAsF as the ground state, neutron diffraction
reveals no evidence of long-range magnetic order associated with Fe. We show
that the frustrating interplane interaction J3 between the adjacent [EuF]+
layers is comparable with in-plane J1-J2 interactions already in the case of
semiconducting fluorite layers [TAs]- (T = Zn and Mn) and becomes dominant in
the case of the metallic [FeAs]- ones. The latter, along with a slight
orthorhombic distortion, is proposed to be the origin of the incommensurate
magnetic structure observed in EuFeAsF.

Owing to their interesting spectral properties, the synthetic crystals over
lattices other than regular Euclidean lattices, such as hyperbolic and fractal
ones, have attracted renewed attention, especially from materials and
meta-materials research communities. They can be studied under the umbrella of
quantum dynamics over Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. In this work,
we investigate numerical aspects related to the quantum dynamics over such
Cayley graphs. Using an algebraic formulation of the "periodic boundary
condition" due to Lueck [Geom. Funct. Anal. 4, 455-481 (1994)], we devise a
practical and converging numerical method that resolves the true bulk spectrum
of the Hamiltonians. Exact results on the matrix elements of the resolvent,
derived from the combinatorics of the Cayley graphs, give us the means to
validate our algorithms and also to obtain new combinatorial statements. Our
results open the systematic research of quantum dynamics over Cayley graphs of
a very large family of finitely generated groups, which includes the free and
Fuchsian groups.

<h3>Quantum Kinetic Theory of Nonlinear Optical Currents: Finite Fermi  surface and Fermi sea contributions</h3>

The quantum kinetic framework provides a versatile method for investigating
the dynamical optical and transport currents of crystalline solids. In this
paper, starting from the density-matrix equations of motion, we present a
general theoretical path to obtain nonlinear optical responses elegantly and
transparently. We devise a kinetic theory applicable to materials with
arbitrary band structures and captures intraband and interband coherence
effects, finite Fermi surfaces, and disorder effects. We present a
classification of nonlinear optical currents arising from the interference of
interband and intraband components of the density matrix with distinct symmetry
and quantum geometrical origin for each contribution. In this context, we
report four findings. (i) The Fermi Golden Rule approach is insufficient to
derive the correct expression for the injection current, a shortcoming that we
remedy in our theory while associating the injection current with the
intraband-interband contribution to the second-order density matrix. (ii) The
interband-intraband contribution yields a resonant current that survives
irrespective of any symmetry constraint in addition to the well-known anomalous
nonlinear current (non-resonant), which requires time-reversal symmetry. (iii)
Quite generally, the nonlinear current is significantly enhanced by
contributions from the finite Fermi surface. (iv) The finite Fermi surface and
Fermi sea additionally lead to sizable novel nonlinear effects via
contributions we term double resonant and higher-order pole. As an
illustration, we compute the nonlinear response of topological antiferromagnet
CuMnAs and thin film tilted Weyl semimetals dominated by interband coherence
effects. We find that the nonlinear response of CuMnAs is responsive to the
direction of finite magnetization field and choice of the polarization angle of
the beam, while Weyl semimetal only to tilt.

Supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) are inorganic-organic hybrid
materials with a unique periodic nanostructure, and as such they have been
gaining growing attention for their intriguing functional properties and
parallelisms with hierarchical biomaterials. Their mechanical behavior remains,
however, poorly understood, even though its understanding and control are of
paramount importance to allow SCNCs implementation into devices. An important
aspect that has not been tackled yet is their time-dependent deformation
behavior, which is nevertheless expected to play an important role in materials
containing such a distribution of organic phase. Hereby, we report on the creep
of ceramic-organic SCNCs with varying degrees of organic crosslinking, as
assessed via nanoindentation. Creep strains and their partial recoverability
are observed, hinting at the co-presence of viscoelasticity and
viscoplasticity, and a clear effect of crosslinking in decreasing the overall
material deformability. We rationalize our experimental observations with the
analysis of stress exponent and activation volume, resulting in a power-law
breakdown behavior and governing deformation mechanisms occurring at the
organic sub-nm interfaces scale, in terms of organic ligands rearrangement. The
set of results is reinforced by the evaluation of the strain rate sensitivity
via strain rate jump tests, and the assessment of the effect of oscillations
during continuous stiffness measurement mode.

We investigate the effects of the electron-electron interactions on the
quantum transport through a charge Kondo circuit. The setup consists of a
quantum dot sandwiched between two leads by two nearly transparent single mode
quantum point contacts. The size of the interacting area $L$ in the Luttinger
liquid formed in the vicinities of the narrow constrictions is assumed to be
much smaller compared to the size of the quantum dot $a$. We predict that the
interplay between the electron-electron interactions in the Luttinger liquid
and the fingerprints of the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the vicinity of the
two channel Kondo intermediate coupling fixed point allows to determine the
interaction strength through the power-law temperature scaling of the electric
conductance.

Accurate prediction of thermodynamic properties requires an extremely
accurate representation of the free energy surface. Requirements are
twofold-first, the inclusion of the relevant finite-temperature mechanisms, and
second, a dense volume-temperature grid on which the calculations are
performed. A systematic workflow for such calculations requires computational
efficiency and reliability, and has not been available within an ab initio
framework so far. Here, we elucidate such a framework involving direct
upsampling, thermodynamic integration and machine-learning potentials, allowing
us to incorporate, in particular, the full effect of anharmonic vibrations. The
improved methodology has a five-times speed-up compared to state-of-the-art
methods. We calculate equilibrium thermodynamic properties up to the melting
point for bcc Nb, magnetic fcc Ni, fcc Al and hcp Mg, and find remarkable
agreement with experimental data. Strong impact of anharmonicity is observed
specifically for Nb. The introduced procedure paves the way for the development
of ab initio thermodynamic databases.

Electrically tuning long-range magnetic orders has been realized in
two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors via electrostatic doping. On the other
hand, the observations are highly diverse: the transition can be realized by
either electrons or holes or both depending on specific materials. Moreover,
doped carriers seem to always favor the ferromagnetic (FM) ground state. The
mechanism behind those diverse observations remains uncovered. Combining
first-principles simulations, we analyze the spin superexchange paths of the
correlated d/f orbitals around band edges and assign 2D magnetic semiconductors
into three types by their projected density of states (PDOS). We find that each
type of PDOS corresponds to a specific carrier-driven magnetic phase transition
and the critical doping density and type of carriers can be quantitatively
obtained by calculating the superexchange coupling strength. The model results
are in good agreements with first-principles calculations and available
measurements. After understanding the mechanism, we can design heterostructures
to realize the FM to antiferromagnetic transition, which has not been realized
before. This model is helpful to understand diverse measurements and expand the
degrees of freedom to control long-range magnetic orders in 2D semiconductors.

We study the capillary attraction force between two fibers dynamically
withdrawn from a bath. We propose an experimental method to measure this force
and show that its magnitude strongly increases with the retraction speed by up
to a factor ten compared to the static case. We show that this remarkable
increase stems from the shape of the dynamical meniscus between the two fibers.
We first study the dynamical meniscus around one fiber, and obtain experimental
and numerical scaling of its size increase with the capillary number, which is
not captured by the classical Landau-Levich-Derjaguin theory. We then show that
the shape of the deformed air-liquid interface around two fibers can be
inferred from the linear superposition of the interface around a single fiber.
These results yield an analytical expression for the attraction which compares
well with the experimental data. Our study reveals the critical role of the
retraction speed to create stronger capillary interactions, with potential
applications in industry or biology.

Lanthanides in the trivalent oxidation state are typically described using an
ionic picture that leads to localized magnetic moments. The hierarchical energy
scales associated with trivalent lanthanides produce desirable properties for
e.g., molecular magnetism, quantum materials, and quantum transduction. Here,
we show that this traditional ionic paradigm breaks down for praseodymium in
the 4+ oxidation state. Synthetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical tools
deployed on several solid-state Pr4+ oxides uncover the unusual participation
of 4f orbitals in bonding and the anomalous hybridization of the 4f1
configuration with ligand valence electrons, analogous to transition metals.
The resulting competition between crystal-field and spin-orbit-coupling
interactions fundamentally transforms the spin-orbital magnetism of Pr4+, which
departs from the Jeff =1/2 limit and resembles that of high-valent actinides.
Our results show that Pr4+ ions are in a class on their own, where the
hierarchy of single-ion energy scales can be tailored to explore new correlated
phenomena in quantum materials.

Ion concentration polarization (CP, current-induced concentration gradient
adjacent to a charge-selective interface) has been well studied for
single-phase mixed conductors (e.g., liquid electrolyte), but multiphase CP has
been rarely addressed in literature. In our recent publication, we proposed
that CP above certain threshold currents can flip the phase distribution in
multiphase ion-intercalation nanofilms sandwiched by ion-blocking electrodes.
We call this phenomenon as multiphase polarization (MP). We then proposed that
MP can further lead to nonvolatile interfacial resistive switching (RS) for
asymmetric electrodes with ion-modulated electron transfer, which theory can
reproduce the experimental results of LTO memristors. In this work, we derive a
comprehensive 2D phase-field model for coupled ion-electron transport in
ion-intercalation materials, with surface effects including electron transfer
kinetics, non-neutral wetting, energy relaxation, and surface charge. Then we
use the model to study MP. We present time evolution of phase boundaries, and
analyze the switching time, current, energy, and cyclic voltammetry, for
various boundary conditions. We find that the switching performance can be
improved significantly by manipulating surface conditions and mean
concentration. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP-based memories and
possible extensions of the current model.

Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide band gap material with both strong
excitonic light emission in the ultraviolet and strong exciton-phonon coupling.
Luminescence experiments performed on the recently synthesized monolayer form
(m-hBN) present emission spectra that differ from one another, with some
suggesting a coexistence between phonon-assisted and direct emission channels.
Motivated by these results, we investigated the optical response of (m-hBN)
using a new \textit{ab initio} approach that takes into account the effects of
atomic vibrations on the luminescence spectra. We construct the dynamical
exciton-phonon self-energy, then use it to perturbatively correct the optical
response functions and test this approach on bulk hBN as a benchmark. Within
our approach we are able to estimate the renormalisation of the direct peak
induced by phonon-assisted transitions, and this allows us to accurately
describe spectra where both processes are present. We find that the m-hBN
emission signal is mainly due to the bright direct exciton and rule out phonon
replicas as the cause of the fine structure observed in some experiments.

We report on the thinning of supported liquid films driven by
thermocapillarity. The liquids are oil films, of initial thicknesses of a few
tens of microns. A local and moderate heating of the glass substrate on which
they are spread on induces a thermocapillary flow, which allows the formation
of ultra-thin films. We show that, within a given time range, the thinning
dynamics of submicron thick films is governed by the thermocapillary stress. It
results in a simple dependency of the thickness profiles with time, which is
evidenced by the collapse of the data onto a master curve. The master curve
only depends on the liquid properties and on the thermal gradient, and allows a
measurement of the latter. As the films further thin down to thicknesses within
the range of molecular interactions, a deviation from the master curve appears.
Although all investigated oils are supposedly fully wetting glass, the nature
of the deviation differs between alkanes and silicone oils. We attribute the
observed behaviors to differing signs of disjoining pressures, and this picture
is confirmed by numerical resolution of the thin-film equation. We suggest
thermocapillary flows can be used to finely probe molecular interactions.

The aim of this work is to generalize the method of Hubbard fields in fermion
Quantum Monte Carlo simulation to the case of link fields. The introduced
Hubbard link fields play a role of the interaction fields responsible for the
attraction and repulsion of electronic excitations at the nodes. Such
improvements leads to a number of advantages concerning thermalization length,
autocorrelations, metastable states and probability distributions of the
quantities. It is demonstrated that computations using five fields are more

We study an integer automaton elasto-plastic model of an amorphous solid
subject to cyclic shear of amplitude $\Gamma$. We focus on the reversible
plastic regime at intermediate $\Gamma_0<\Gamma<\Gamma_y$, where, after a
transient, the system settles into a periodic limit cycle with hysteretic,
dissipative plastic events which repeat after an integer number of cycles. We
study the plastic strain rate, $\frac{d\epsilon}{d\gamma}$, (where $\gamma$ is
the applied strain and $\epsilon$ is the plastic strain) during the terminal
limit cycles and show that it consists of a creeping regime at low $\gamma$
with very low $\frac{d\epsilon}{d\gamma}$ followed by a sharp transition at a
characteristic strain, $\gamma_*$, and stress, $\sigma_*$, to a flowing regime
with higher $\frac{d\epsilon}{d\gamma}$. We show that while increasing $\Gamma$
above $\Gamma_0$ results in lower terminal ground state energy,
$U_{\text{min}}$, and a correspondingly narrower distribution of stresses, it,
surprisingly, results in lower $\gamma_*$, and $\sigma_*$. The stress
distribution, $P(\sigma)$, also becomes skewed for $\Gamma>\Gamma_0$. That is,
the systems in the RPR are anomalously soft and mechanically polarized. We
relate this to an emergent characteristic feature in the stress distribution,
$P(\sigma)$, at a value, $\sigma_0$, which is independent of $\Gamma$ and show
that $\sigma_0$ implies a relation between the $\Gamma$ dependence of
$\sigma_*$, $\gamma_*$, and the amplitude of plastic strain, $\epsilon_p$. We
show that the onset of hysteresis is characterized by a power-law scaling,
indicative of a second order transition with $\epsilon_p\propto
(\Gamma-\Gamma_0)^{1.2\pm0.1}$. We argue that $\sigma_0$ and, correspondingly,
the onset of the RPR at $\Gamma=\Gamma_0$, is simply set by the so-called
Eshelby-stress. Furthermore, we show that cycling at $\Gamma_0$ results in a
maximally hardened state.

A computational framework that leverages data from self-consistent field
theory simulations with deep learning to accelerate the exploration of
parameter space for block copolymers is presented. This is a substantial
two-dimensional extension of the framework introduced in [1]. Several
innovations and improvements are proposed. (1) A Sobolev space-trained,
convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to handle the exponential
dimension increase of the discretized, local average monomer density fields and
to strongly enforce both spatial translation and rotation invariance of the
predicted, field-theoretic intensive Hamiltonian. (2) A generative adversarial
network (GAN) is introduced to efficiently and accurately predict saddle point,
local average monomer density fields without resorting to gradient descent
methods that employ the training set. This GAN approach yields important
savings of both memory and computational cost. (3) The proposed machine
learning framework is successfully applied to 2D cell size optimization as a
clear illustration of its broad potential to accelerate the exploration of
parameter space for discovering polymer nanostructures. Extensions to
three-dimensional phase discovery appear to be feasible.
