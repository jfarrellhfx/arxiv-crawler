<h3>Exact Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Lattice Random Walks in Hexagonal and  Honeycomb Domains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08868" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08868</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Marris, Seeralan Sarvaharman, Luca Giuggioli</i>
<br>
<br>
A variety of transport processes in natural and man-made systems are
intrinsically random. To model their stochasticity, lattice random walks have
been employed for a long time, mainly by considering Cartesian lattices.
However, in many applications in bounded space the geometry of the domain may
have profound effects on the dynamics and ought to be accounted for. We
consider here the cases of the six-neighbour (hexagonal) and three-neighbour
(honeycomb) lattice, which are utilised in models ranging from adatoms
diffusing in metals and excitations diffusing on single-walled carbon nanotubes
to animal foraging strategy and the formation of territories in scent-marking
organisms. In these and other examples, the main theoretical tool to study the
dynamics of lattice random walks in hexagonal geometries has been via
simulations. Analytic representations have in most cases been inaccessible, in
particular in bounded hexagons, given the complicated zig-zag boundary
conditions that a walker is subject to. Here we generalise the method of images
to hexagonal geometries and obtain closed-form expressions for the occupation
probability, the so-called propagator, for lattice random walks both on
hexagonal and honeycomb lattices with periodic, reflective and absorbing
boundary conditions. In the periodic case, we identify two possible choices of
image placement and their corresponding propagators. Using them, we construct
the exact propagators for the other boundary conditions, and we derive
transport related statistical quantities such as first passage probabilities to
one or multiple targets and their means, elucidating the effect of the boundary
condition on transport properties.

<h3>Thermodynamic variational relation</h3>

In systems far from equilibrium, the statistics of observables are connected
to entropy production, leading to the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR).
However, the derivation of TURs often involves constraining the parity of
observables, such as considering asymmetric currents, making it unsuitable for
the general case. We propose a Thermodynamic Variational Relation (TVR) between
the statistics of general observables and entropy production, based on the
variational representation of $f$-divergences. From this result, we derive a
universal TUR and other relations for higher-order statistics of observables.

<h3>Double roton-minima in bosonic fractional quantum Hall states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08875" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08875</a>
<br>
<i>Moumita Indra, Deepak Jain, Sandip Mondal</i>
<br>
<br>
We have studied the collective spin-conserving collective excitation spectra
in rotating diluted ultra-cold Bose atoms. Double roton-minima have been
observed in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states for the two filling
fractions ($\nu$) of the first series of Jain's composite fermion sequences.
The obtained roton-minima for $\nu$ = 1/4 are at the wave-vectors 1.26 and 2.38
and the roton-minima for $\nu$ = 1/6 have been shifted to 1.08 and 2.06. Such
shift of roton-minima is attributed due to strong correlation between the
particles in bosonic FQH-system. Moreover, the number of roton minima observed
depends upon number of attached fluxes as well as the ranges of interaction
between the particles.

<h3>Interplay of spin and charge order in the electron-doped cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08900</a>
<br>
<i>David Riegler, Jannis Seufert, Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Peter Wölfle, Ronny Thomale, Michael Klett</i>
<br>
<br>
We study magnetic and charge order in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates
based on the one-band Hubbard model with onsite $U$ and nearest-neighbor
interaction $V$. To investigate the interplay between the orders, we employ the
Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson method and analyze fluctuations descending from
antiferromagnetic mean-field ground states. We find repulsive $V$ to
significantly reduce the phase-separated insulating/metallic parameter domain,
especially for the electron-doped regime. Our analysis reveals charge order
with incommensurate ordering vector $\boldsymbol Q_{\scriptsize\text{iCO}}$
that quantitatively matches RXS measurements in Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (NCCO).
Moreover, we determine a paramagnon dispersion beyond linear spin-wave theory
and a coupling of the spin and charge sector in agreement with the RIXS signal.

<h3>Dynamics of parafermionic states in transport measurements</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Advances in hybrid fractional quantum Hall (FQH)-superconductor platforms
pave the way for realisation of parafermionic modes. We analyse signatures of
these non-abelian anyons in transport measurements across devices with
$\mathbb{Z}_6$ parafermions (PFs) coupled to an external electrode. Simulating
the dynamics of these open systems by a stochastic quantum jump method, we show
that a current readout over sufficiently long times constitutes a projective
measurement of the fractional charge shared by two PFs. Interaction of these
topological modes with the FQH environment, however, may cause poisoning events
affecting this degree of freedom which we model by jump operators that describe
incoherent coupling of PFs with FQH edge modes. We analyse how this gives rise
to a characteristic three-level telegraph noise in the current, constituting a
very strong signature of PFs. We discuss also other forms of poisoning and
noise caused by interaction with fractional quasiparticles in the bulk of the
Hall system. We conclude our work with an analysis of four-PF devices, in
particular on how the PF fusion algebra can be observed in electrical transport
experiments.

<h3>Non-Linear Interference Challenging Topological Protection of Chiral  Edge States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08912" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08912</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Michen, Jan Carl Budich</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on a non-linear scattering effect that challenges the notion of
topological protection for wave packets propagating in chiral edge modes.
Specifically, in a Floquet topological system with a non-linear potential, we
demonstrate how a wave packet propagating in a chiral edge mode may be
irreversibly deflected by scattering off a localized wave-packet, or pass the
collision region virtually unaffected in an approximately linear fashion. An
experimentally accessible knob to tune between those two scenarios is provided
by the relative phase between the involved wave-packets. This genuinely
non-linear interference phenomenon is in stark contrast to linear scattering
off a static impurity, which cannot destroy a topological edge state. Besides
corroborating our findings with numerically exact simulations, we propose two
physical platforms where our predictions may be verified with state of the art
experimental techniques: First, a photonic crystal setting where non-linearity
has been engineered via an intensity-dependent optical index. Second, a
Bose-Einstein condensate of cold atoms in an optical Honeycomb lattice governed
by a non-linear Gross-Pitaevskii equation that effectively accounts for
many-body interactions.

<h3>Absolutely Stable Discrete Time Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08925" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08925</a>
<br>
<i>Krzysztof Giergiel, Jia Wang, Bryan J. Dalton, Peter Hannaford, Krzysztof Sacha</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that interacting bosons on a ring which are driven periodically by a
rotating lattice potential can support absolutely stable discrete time
crystals. The absolute stability is demonstrated by an exact mapping of
discrete time crystal states to low-lying eigenstates of a time-independent
model that reveals spontaneous breaking of space translation symmetry. The
mapping ensures that there are no residual time-dependent terms that could lead
to heating of the system and destruction of discrete time crystals. With the
help of the Bethe ansatz solutions we also analyze periodically kicked bosons
where the mapping is approximate only and cannot guarantee the absolute
stability of discrete time crystals. However, the kicked boson model shows a
richer interplay between time and space symmetry breaking.

<h3>Rejection-free quantum Monte Carlo in continuous time from transition  path sampling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08935" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08935</a>
<br>
<i>Luke Causer, Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
<br>
Continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo refers to a class of algorithms designed
to sample the thermal distribution of a quantum Hamiltonian through exact
expansions of the Boltzmann exponential in terms of stochastic trajectories
which are periodic in imaginary time. Here, we show that for
(sign-problem-free) quantum many-body systems with discrete degrees of freedom
-- such as spins on a lattice -- this sampling can be done in a rejection-free
manner using transition path sampling (TPS). The key idea is to converge the
trajectory ensemble through updates where one individual degree of freedom is
modified across all time while the remaining unaltered ones provide a
time-dependent background. The ensuing single-body dynamics provides a way to
generate trajectory updates exactly, allowing one to obtain the target ensemble
efficiently via rejection-free TPS. We demonstrate our method on the transverse
field Ising model in one and two dimensions, and on the quantum triangular
plaquette (or Newman-Moore) model. We show that despite large autocorrelation
times, our method is able to efficiently recover the respective quantum phase
transition of each model. We also discuss the connection to rare event sampling
in continuous-time Markov dynamics.

<h3>Influence of amorphous phase on coercivity in SmCo5-Cu nanocomposites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08948</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Severe plastic deformation of powder blends consisting of SmCo5-Cu results in
magnetically hardened nanocomposite bulk materials. The microstructure is
continuously refined with increasing torsional deformation, yet, coercivity
saturates at a certain level of strain. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
investigation of the microstructure reveals a partial amorphization of the
SmCo5 phase due to high-pressure torsion by 20 applied rotations. In this
amorphous matrix nanocrystals are embedded. The effect of these experimentally
observed microstructural features on the magnetic properties are investigated
by micromagnetic simulations, which show that an increasing volume fraction of
nanocrystals is beneficial for higher coercivities. For a fixed volume fraction
of nanocrystals the simulations reveal an increasing coercivity with decreasing
the size of the nanocrystals due to increasing number of interfaces acting as
pinning sites. Furthermore, our micromagnetic simulations disclose the
mechanisms of the saturation and decline of magnetic hardening due to the
strain induced by high-pressure torsion. The calculated coercivity fits very
well to the experimentally observed coercivity of Hc=1.34 T. The knowledge can
also be used to develop and provide optimization strategies from the
microstructure perspective.

In a recent review~Landsgesell et al., Soft Matter {\bf 15}, 1155 (2019)
stated that $\text{pH} - \text{pK}_a$ is a ``universal parameter" for titrating
systems. We show that this is not the case. This broken symmetry has important
implications for constant pH (cpH) simulations. In particular, we show that for
concentrated suspensions the error resulting from the use of cpH algorithm
described by Landsgesell et al. is very significant, even for suspension
containing 1:1 electrolyte. We show how to modify the cpH algorithm to account
for the grand-canonical nature of the cpH simulations and for the charge
neutrality requirement.

<h3>Germanium wafers for strained quantum wells with low disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08971" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08971</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Alberto Tosato, Davide Degli Esposti, Davide Costa, Menno Veldhorst, Amir Sammak, Giordano Scappucci</i>
<br>
<br>
We grow strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures by reduced-pressure chemical vapor
deposition on 100 mm Ge wafers. The use of Ge wafers as substrates for epitaxy
enables high-quality Ge-rich SiGe strain-relaxed buffers with a threading
dislocation density of (6$\pm$1)$\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-2}$, nearly an order of
magnitude improvement compared to control strain-relaxed buffers on Si wafers.
The associated reduction in short-range scattering allows for a drastic
improvement of the disorder properties of the two-dimensional hole gas,
measured in several Ge/SiGe heterostructure field-effect transistors. We
measure an average low percolation density of (1.22$\pm$0.03)$\times$10$^{10}$
cm$^{-2}$, and an average maximum mobility of (3.4$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{6}$
cm$^2$/Vs and quantum mobility of (8.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^2$/Vs when
the hole density in the quantum well is saturated to
(1.65$\pm$0.02)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. We anticipate immediate application
of these heterostructures for next-generation, higher-performance Ge
spin-qubits and their integration into larger quantum processors.

<h3>First order phase transitions within Weyl type of materials at low  temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09007</a>
<br>
<i>Y. M. P. Gomes, Everlyn Martins, Marcus Benghi Pinto, Rudnei O. Ramos</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the possible dynamical chiral symmetry breaking patterns taking
place within Weyl type of materials. Here, these systems are modeled by the
(2+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model with a tilt in the Dirac cone. The
optimized perturbation theory (OPT) is employed in order to evaluate the
effective potential at finite temperatures and chemical potentials, beyond the
traditional large-$N$ limit. Finite $N$ corrections show that a first-order
phase transition boundary, missed at large-$N$, exists in the regime of low
temperatures and large chemical potentials. This result, which represents our
main finding, implies that one should hit a region of mixed phases when
exploring the low-temperature range. The associated first order transition
line, which starts at $T=0$, terminates at a tricritical point such that the
transitions taking place at high-$T$ are of the second kind. In particular, we
discuss how the tilt in the Dirac cone affects the position of the tricritical
point as well as the values of critical temperature and coexistence chemical
potential among other quantities. Some experimental implications and
predictions are also briefly discussed.

<h3>Quasi-static Lineshape Theory for Rydberg Excitations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09010</a>
<br>
<i>Trevor Scheuing, Jesús Pérez Ríos</i>
<br>
<br>
This work presents a theoretical approach for lineshapes of Rydberg
excitations. In particular, we introduce the quasi-static lineshape theory,
leading to a methodic and general approach, and its validity is studied. Next,
using $^{84}$Sr as a prototypical scenario, we discuss the role of the thermal
atoms and core-perturber interactions, generally disregarded in Rydberg
physics. Finally, we present a characterization of the role of Ryderg-core
perturber interactions based on the density and principal quantum number that,
beyond affecting the lineshape, could potentially apply to chemi-ionization
reactions responsible for the decay or Rydberg atoms in high density media.

<h3>A Quantitative Solution to the Kondo Lattice Problem</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09012</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Bretaña, Sean Fayfar, Wouter Montfrooij</i>
<br>
<br>
Metallic Kondo Lattice systems that have been prepared to exhibit a
competition between ordering of magnetic moments and shielding of those moments
by the conduction electrons down to absolute zero display unusual
low-temperature responses. Here we show that the dominant response of such
systems is caused by two quantum effects: zero-point motion of the ions, and
the size of the system restricting the allowed wavelengths of fluctuations.
This zero-point motion of the ions induces a broad distribution in Kondo
shielding temperatures that renders the assumption of a uniform heavy-fermion
ground state untenable. However, letting go of this assumption and instead
incorporating these two quantum effects leads to percolation physics that
quantitatively captures the non-Fermi liquid response in both stoichiometric
and doped quantum critical compounds, allowing for a unified description of all
quantum critical systems.

<h3>Vortex wake patterns in superfluid $^{4}He$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09051</a>
<br>
<i>Eugene B. Kolomeisky</i>
<br>
<br>
Elementary excitations in the form of quantized vortex rings exist in
superfluid $^{4}He$ at energies and momenta exceeding those of the Landau
phonon-roton spectrum. Their interference determines wake patterns due to
uniformly traveling sources in bulk superfluid at low speeds and pressures. The
dispersion law of these excitations resembles that of gravity waves on deep
water with infrared wave number cutoff. As a result, wake patterns featuring
elements of the Kelvin ship wake are predicted. Specifically, at lowest speeds
the pattern with fully developed transverse and diverging wavefronts is
present. At intermediate speeds transverse wavefronts are absent within a cone
whose opening angle increases with the source velocity. At largest speeds only
diverging wavefronts confined within a cone whose opening angle decreases with
the source velocity are found. When experimentally observed, these changes in
appearance of wake patterns serve as indicators of the beginning part of the
vortex branch of elementary excitations.

<h3>Magnon Hall effect in antiferromagnetic lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09077" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09077</a>
<br>

Topology applied to condensed matter is an important area of research and
technology, and topological magnetic excitations have recently become an active
field of study. In this paper we present a general discussion of magnon Hall
transport in two-dimensional antiferromagnets. First, we study the Union Jack
lattice, where an effective time-reversal symmetry is broken, making the system
display the magnon Hall effect. Then, we investigate the brick-wall lattice
where such symmetry is present, and as a consequence we have a phenomenon
similar to the quantum spin Hall effect in electronic systems. Both lattices
have not yet been studied from the topological point of view. The coexistence
of opposite spin polarization in an antiferromagnet resembles the electron spin
in a variety of transport phenomena. We study topological magnon effects in the
aforementioned lattices with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and easy-axis
single-ion anisotropy. We calculate the Berry curvature from the eigenvalues of
the Hamiltonian. From that, we plot the spin Hall and thermal Hall
conductivities, as well as the spin Nernst coefficient, as functions of the
temperature. In the Union Jack lattice, we treat the effect of anharmonic
interactions using a mean-field spin wave theory where the Hamiltonian becomes
implicitly temperature-dependent. We determine self-consistently the
renormalized dispersion and the staggered magnetization as a function of
temperature. Our calculations can be applied to other antiferromagnetic
lattices.

<h3>Charge fluctuations in charge regulated systems: dependence on  statistical ensemble</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09080" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09080</a>

We investigate charge regulation of nanoparticles in concentrated
suspensions, focusing on the effect of different statistical ensembles. We find
that the choice of ensemble does not affect the mean charge of nanoparticles,
but significantly alters the magnitude of its fluctuation. Specifically, we
compared the behaviors of colloidal charge fluctuations in the semi-grand
canonical and canonical ensembles, and identified significant differences
between the two. The choice of ensemble -- whether the system is isolated or is
in contact with a reservoir of acid and salt -- will, therefore, affect the
Kirkwood-Shumaker fluctuation-induced force inside concentrated suspensions.
Our results emphasize the importance of selecting an appropriate ensemble that
accurately reflects the experimental conditions when studying
fluctuation-induced forces between polyelectrolytes, proteins, and colloidal
particles in concentrated suspensions.

<h3>Measurement of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction in Mn4N Films that  Host Skyrmions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09087" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09087</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Zhou, Chung Ting Ma, S. Joseph Poon</i>
<br>
<br>
Mn4N thin film is one of the potential magnetic mediums for spintronic
devices due to its ferrimagnetism with low magnetization, large perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA), thermal stability, and large domain wall velocity. A
recent experiment confirmed the existence of tunable magnetic skyrmions in
MgO/Mn4N/CuxPt1-x(x=0,0.5,0.9,0.95), and density functional theory (DFT)
calculation provided a large theoretical value of the interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (iDMI) of Mn4N/Pt, which is consistent with
the predicted chemical trend of DMI in transition metal/Pt films. So far,
measured DMI has not been reported in Mn4N which is needed in order to support
the predicted large DMI value. This paper reports the average DMI of
MgO/Mn4N(17nm)/CuxPt1-x(3nm), extracted from the anomalous Hall effect with
various tilted angles, based on magnetic droplet theory with DMI effects. The
DMI decreases from 0.267 mJ/m2 to 0.011 mJ/m2 with non-linear tendencies as Cu
concentration in the CuxPt1-x capping layer increases from 0 to 1,
demonstrating the control of DMI through CuxPt1-x capping layer. Furthermore, a
solid solution model is developed, based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) compositional depth profile, to analyze the possible effects on DMI from
the mixing layers at the surface of Mn4N. After taking into account the mixing
layers, the large DMI in Mn4N film with Pt capping is consistent with the
predicted DMI.

<h3>Symbolic determinant construction of perturbative expansions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09103</a>
<br>
<i>Ibsal Assi, J. P. F. LeBlanc</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a symbolic algorithm for treating perturbative expansions of
Hamiltonians with general two-body interactions. The method, formally
equivalent to determinant Monte Carlo methods, merges well-known analytics with
the recently developed symbolic integration tool, algorithmic Matsubara
integration (AMI) that allows for the evaluation of the imaginary
frequency/time integrals. By explicitly performing Wick contractions at each
order of the perturbative expansion we order-by-order construct the fully
analytic solution of the Green's function and self energy expansions. A key
component of this process is the assignment of momentum/frequency conserving
labels for each contraction that motivates us to present a fully symbolic
Fourier transform procedure which accomplishes this feat. These solutions can
be applied to a broad class of quantum chemistry problems and are valid at
arbitrary temperatures and on both the real- and Matsubara-frequency axis. To
demonstrate the utility of this approach, we present results for simple
molecular systems as well as model lattice Hamiltonians. We highlight the case
of molecular problems where our results at each order are numerically exact
with no stochastic uncertainty.

<h3>Energy Consumption Modeling for DED-based Hybrid Additive Manufacturing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09104" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09104</a>
<br>
<i>Md Rabiul Hasan, Zhichao Liu, Asif Rahman</i>
<br>
<br>
The awareness of energy consumption is gaining much more attention in
manufacturing due to its economic and sustainability benefits. An energy
consumption model is needed for quantifying the consumption and predicting the
impact of various process parameters in manufacturing. This paper aims to
develop an energy consumption model for Direct Energy Deposition (DED) based
Hybrid Additive Manufacturing (HAM) for an Inconel 718 part. The Specific
Energy Consumption (SEC) is used while developing the energy consumption of the
product manufacturing lifecycle. This study focuses on the analysis to
investigate three significant factors (scanning speed, laser power, and feed
rate), their interactions' effects, and whether they have a significant
effect.in energy consumption. The results suggest that all the factors have a
strong influence, but their interaction effects have a weak influence on the
energy consumption for HAM. Among the three process parameters, it is found
that laser power has the most significant effect on energy consumption. Again,
based on the regression analysis, this study also recommends high scanning
speed while the laser power and feed rate should be low. Also, idle time has
significant energy consumption during the whole HAM process.

<h3>Gate-tunable multiband transport in ZrTe5 thin devices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Interest in ZrTe5 has been reinvigorated in recent years owing to its
potential for hosting versatile topological electronic states and intriguing
experimental discoveries. However, the mechanism of many of its unusual
transport behaviors remains controversial, for example, the characteristic peak
in the temperature-dependent resistivity and the anomalous Hall effect. Here,
through employing a clean dry-transfer fabrication method under inert
environment, we successfully obtain high-quality ZrTe5 thin devices that
exhibit clear dual-gate tunability and ambipolar field effects. Such devices
allow us to systematically study the resistance peak as well as the Hall effect
at various doping densities and temperatures, revealing the contribution from
electron-hole asymmetry and multiple-carrier transport. By comparing with
theoretical calculations, we suggest a simplified semiclassical two-band model
to explain the experimental observations. Our work helps to resolve the
long-standing puzzles on ZrTe5 and could potentially pave the way for realizing
novel topological states in the two-dimensional limit.

The only kinematically-allowed phonon-scattering events for bands of subsonic
fermions ($v_F < v_p$) are interband transitions, leading to different low-$T$
transport physics than in the typical supersonic case. We apply a kinetic
theory of phonon-limited transport to a generic two-band system of subsonic
fermions, deriving formulae for relaxation times and resistivity that are
accurate in the limit of close bands and small $v_F/v_p$. We predict regimes of
$\rho \propto T$, $\rho \propto T^2$, and perfect conductivity. Our theory
predicts linear-in-$T$ resistivity down to a crossover temperature that is
suppressed from its supersonic analogue by a factor of $v_F/v_p$, offering a
new explanation for low-$T$ "strange metal" behavior observed in flat band
systems.

A recent experimental demonstration of a parametric magnetization oscillation
excited by applying a microwave voltage to a ferromagnetic metal will be
applicable not only to a new magnetization switching method but also to
bio-inspired computing. It should be, however, noted that a phase of the
parametric magnetization oscillation is not uniquely locked, related to the
fact that a frequency of the microwave voltage is twice the value of the
magnetization oscillation. There are two possible phases in the parametric
oscillation state, and which of the two is realized depends on the initial
condition of the magnetization. Here, we examine two approaches to lock the
phase uniquely. One is to suppress the distribution of the initial state by
enhancing the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy before applying microwave
voltage, and the other is to use a sweeping frequency. Through numerical
simulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and quantification of locked
rate, we find that the sweeping frequency is more effective to lock the phase
of the parametric magnetization oscillation.

Input-driven dynamical systems have attracted attention because their
dynamics can be used as resources for brain-inspired computing. The recent
achievement of human-voice recognition by spintronic oscillator also utilizes
an input-driven magnetization dynamics. Here, we investigate an excitation of
input-driven chaos in magnetization dynamics by voltage controlled magnetic
anisotropy effect. The study focuses on the parametric magnetization
oscillation induced by a microwave voltage and investigates the effect of
random-pulse input on the oscillation behavior. Solving the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, temporal dynamics of the magnetization and
its statistical character are evaluated. In a weak perturbation limit, the
temporal dynamics of the magnetization are mainly determined by the input
signal, which is classified as input-driven synchronization. In a large
perturbation limit, on the other hand, chaotic dynamics are observed, where the
dynamical response is sensitive to the initial state. The existence of chaos is
also identified by the evaluation of the Lyapunov exponent.

We report the first observation of the spin Hall conductivity spectrum in
GaAs at room temperature. After the optical injection of spin-polarized
carriers, polarization rotation of a terahertz pulse is observed as a
manifestation of the inverse spin Hall effect. The spectrum for the spin Hall
conductivity of electrons exhibits an excellent agreement with microscopic
theories only using known parameters. The results clearly demonstrate that,
unlike in the DC regime, the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism is dominant in
terahertz frequency, enabling high-speed less-dissipative charge-spin current
conversion.

Microorganisms, such as E.Coli, are known to display upstream behavior and
respond rheotactically to shear flows. In particular, E.Coli suspensions have
been shown to display strong sensitivity to spatial constrictions, leading to
an anomalous densification past the constriction for incoming fluid velocities
comparable to the microoganism's self propulsion speed. We introduce a Brownian
dynamics model for ellipsoidal self-propelling particles in a confined channel
subject to a constriction. The model allows to identify the relevant parameters
that characterize the relevant dynamical regimes of the accumulation of the
active particles at the constriction, and clarify the mechanisms underlying the
experimental observations. We find that particles are trapped in butterfly-like
attractors in front of the constriction, which is the origin of the symmetry
breaking in the emerging density profiles of active particles passing the
constriction. In addition, the probability of trapping and thus the strength of
asymmetry is affected by size of the particles and geometry of the channel, as
well as the ratio of fluid velocity to propulsion speed.

Topological phases of matter are classified based on symmetries, with
nonsymmorphic symmetries like glide reflections and screw rotations being of
particular importance in the classification. In contrast to extensively studied
glide reflections in real space, introducing space-dependent gauge
transformations can lead to momentum-space glide reflection symmetries, which
may even change the fundamental domain for topological classifications, e.g.,
from a torus to a Klein bottle. Here we discover a new class of
three-dimensional (3D) higher-order topological insulators, protected by a pair
of momentum-space glide reflections. It supports gapless hinge modes, as
dictated by Wannier Hamiltonians defined on a Klein bottle manifold, and we
introduce two topological invariants to characterize this phase. Our predicted
topological hinge modes are experimentally verified in a 3D-printed acoustic
crystal, providing direct evidence for 3D higher-order Klein bottle topological
insulators. Our results not only showcase the remarkable role of momentum-space
glide reflections in topological classifications, but also pave the way for
experimentally exploring physical effects arising from momentum-space
nonsymmorphic symmetries.

We propose open quantum spin liquids as a novel platform for studying anyon
condensation topological transitions. As a concrete example, we consider the
Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) coupled to a Markovian environment via the Lindblad
master equation approach. By a combined study of exact solutions and numerical
approaches, we demonstrate a dynamical anyon condensation transition between
the initially prepared pure KSL and mixed-state KSL arising in the steady state
limit, induced by the environment's decoherence and dissipation effects.
General principles of using open quantum spin liquids for anyon condensation
physics are discussed. This work presents a new route for mixed-state quantum
spin liquid and dynamical anyon condensation.

Complex oxides are mesmerizing material systems to realize multiple physical
properties and functionalities by integrating different elements in a single
compound. However, owing to the chemical instability, not all the combinations
of elements can be materialized despite the intriguing potential expected from
their magnetic and electronic properties. In this study, we demonstrate an
epitaxial stabilization of orthorhombic Ru$^{3+}$ perovskite oxides: LaRuO$_3$
and NdRuO$_3$, and their magnetotransport properties that reflect the
difference between non-magnetic La$^{3+}$ and magnetic Nd$^{3+}$. Above all, an
unconventional anomalous Hall effect accompanied by an inflection point in
magnetoresistance is observed around 1.3 T below 1 K for NdRuO$_3$, which is
ascribed to topological Hall effect possibly due to a non-coplanar spin texture
on Nd$^{3+}$ sublattice. These studies not only serve a new testbed for the
interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interaction but also open a
new avenue to explore topological emergent phenomena in well-studied perovskite
oxides.

<h3>Breakdown of helical edge state topologically protected conductance in  time-reversal-breaking excitonic insulators</h3>

Gapless helical edge modes are a hallmark of the quantum spin Hall effect.
Protected by time-reversal symmetry, each edge contributes a quantized
zero-temperature conductance quantum $G_0 \equiv e^2/h$. However, the
experimentally observed conductance in WTe$_2$ decreases below $G_0$ per edge
already at edge lengths around 100 nm, even in the absence of explicit
time-reversal breaking due to an external field or magnetic impurities. In this
work, we show how a time-reversal breaking excitonic condensate with a
spin-spiral order that can form in WTe$_2$ leads to the breakdown of
conductance quantization. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations to compare
time-reversal breaking and preserving excitonic insulators. Using these
mean-field models we demonstrate via quantum transport simulations that weak
non-magnetic disorder reproduces the edge length scaling of resistance observed
in the experiments. We complement this by analysis in the Luttinger liquid
picture, shedding additional light on the mechanism behind the quantization
breakdown.

<h3>Influence of inter-layer interactions and external stimuli on MX$_2$ (M=  Mo/W, X= S/Se) heterobilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Understanding the inter-layer interactions in transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) based heterostructures plays a vital role owing to the
symmetry of the structure, bandgap nature, and excitonic effects. In this
present work, we have studied the structural and electronic properties of
MX$_2$ (M= Mo/W, X= S/Se) heterobilayers using first-principles calculations
based on density functional theory. Unlike the traditional homobilayers of
TMDs, these heterobilayers result in broken inversion symmetry and alter their
point group from D$_{3d}$ $\rightarrow$ C$_{3v}$. From the calculated Raman
spectra of these heterobilayers, we have observed that the shear and layer
breathing modes (LBM) at lower frequencies ($<$ 50 cm$^{-1}$), arise due to the
interlayer interactions between the different monolayers. We have simulated the
electronic properties using the G$_0$W$_0$ method and perceived the nature of
the band gap which mainly depends on the chalcogen atoms. Our results clearly
indicate that the band gap is of direct nature for hetero bilayers with
different chalcogen atoms and indirect nature for the same chalcogen based
heterobilayers, with a band gap range between 1.4 to 1.7 eV. The exciton states
of these materials are calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and
found that the binding energies of inter-layer exciton are of the order of
$\sim$ 250 meV, which makes them useful for infrared optoelectronic
applications. We have also examined the electronic properties under the effect
of minimal strain and twist for different chalcogen-based TMDs, and it shows
the band gap tunability from direct to indirect due to interlayer interactions.

<h3>Optical manipulation of bipolarons in a system with nonlinear  electron-phonon coupling</h3>

We investigate full quantum mechanical evolution of two electrons nonlinearly
coupled to quantum phonons and simulate the dynamical response of the system
subject to a short spatially uniform optical pulse that couples to
dipole-active vibrational modes. Nonlinear electron-phonon coupling can either
soften or stiffen the phonon frequency in the presence of electron density. In
the former case, an external optical pulse tuned just below the phonon
frequency generates attraction between electrons and leads to a long-lived
bound state even after the optical pulse is switched off. It originates from a
dynamical modification of the self-trapping potential that induces a metastable
state. By increasing the pulse frequency, the attractive electron-electron
interaction changes to repulsive. Two sequential optical pulses with different
frequencies can switch between attractive and repulsive interaction.
Pulse-induced binding or repulsion of electrons is shown to be efficient also
for weakly dispersive optical phonons and in the presence of weak Coulomb
repulsion.

<h3>Diffusion of intruders in granular suspensions: Enskog theory and random  walk interpretation</h3>

<br>
<i>Rubén Gómez González, Enrique Abad, Santos Bravo Yuste, Vicente Garzó</i>
<br>
<br>
The Enskog kinetic theory is applied to compute the mean square displacement
of intruders immersed in a granular gas of smooth inelastic hard spheres
(grains). Both species (intruders and grains) are surrounded by an interstitial
molecular gas (background) that plays the role of a thermal bath. The influence
of the latter on the motion of intruders and grains is modeled via a standard
viscous drag force supplemented by a stochastic Langevin-like force
proportional to the background temperature. We solve the corresponding
Enskog--Lorentz kinetic equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion
truncated to first order in the gradient of the intruder number density. The
integral equation for the diffusion coefficient is solved by considering the
first two Sonine approximations. To test these results, we also compute the
diffusion coefficient from the numerical solution of the inelastic Enskog
equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We find that the
first Sonine approximation generally agrees well with the simulation results,
although significant discrepancies arise when the intruders become lighter than
the grains. Such discrepancies are largely mitigated by the use of the
second-Sonine approximation, in excellent agreement with computer simulations
even for moderately strong inelasticities and/or dissimilar mass and diameter
ratios. We invoke a random walk picture of the intruders' motion to shed light
on the physics underlying the intricate dependence of the diffusion coefficient
on the main system parameters. This approach, recently employed to study the
case of an intruder immersed in a granular gas, also proves useful in the
present case of a granular suspension. Finally, we discuss the applicability of
our model to real systems in the self-diffusion case. We conclude that
collisional effects may strongly impact the diffusion coefficient of the
grains.

<h3>Metastability and topology in the magnetic topological insulator  MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</h3>

<br>
We study the effect of stacking faults on the topological properties of the
magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ (MBT) using density
functional theory calculations and the Hubbard $U$ being tuned with many-body
diffusion Monte Carlo techniques. We show that a modest deviation from the
equilibrium interlayer distance leads to a topological phase transition from a
non-trivial to a trivial topology, suggesting that tuning the interlayer
coupling by adjusting the interlayer distance alone can lead to different
topological phases. Interestingly, due to the locally increased interlayer
distance of the top layer, a metastable stacking fault in MBT leads to a nearly
gapless state at the topmost layer due to charge redistribution as the topmost
layer recedes. We further find evidence of spin-momentum locking in the surface
state along with a weak preservation of the band inversion in the near gapless
state, which is indicative of the non-trivial topological surface states for
the metastable stacking fault. Our findings provide a possible explanation for
reconciling the long-standing puzzle of gapped and gapless states on MBT
surfaces.

In this paper, we introduce a novel design paradigm for modular architectured
materials that allows for spatially nonuniform designs from a handful of
building blocks, which can be robotically assembled for efficient and scalable
production. The traditional, design-limiting periodicity in material design is
overcome by utilizing Wang tiles to achieve compatibility among building
blocks. We illustrate our approach with the design and manufacturing of an
L-shaped domain inspired by a scissor-like soft gripper, whose internal module
distribution was optimized to achieve an extreme tilt of a tip of the gripper's
jaw when the handle part was uniformly compressed. The geometry of individual
modules was built on a 3$\times$3 grid of elliptical holes with varying
semi-axes ratios and alternating orientations. We optimized the distribution of
the modules within the L-shaped domain using an enumeration approach combined
with a factorial search strategy. To address the challenge of seamless
interface connections in modular manufacturing, we produced the final designs
by casting silicone rubber into modular molds automatically assembled by a
robotic arm. The predicted performance was validated experimentally using a
custom-built, open-hardware test rig, Thymos, supplemented with digital image
correlation measurements. Our study demonstrates the potential for enhancing
the mechanical performance of architectured materials by incorporating
nonuniform modular designs and efficient robot-assisted manufacturing.

<h3>Mechanism for giant enhancement of transport induced by active  fluctuations</h3>

Understanding the role of active fluctuations in physics is a problem in
statu nascendi appearing both as a hot topic and a major challenge. The reason
for this is the fact that they are inherently non-equilibrium. This feature
opens a landscape of phenomena yet to be explored that are absent in the
presence of thermal fluctuations alone. Recently a paradoxical effect has been
briefly communicated in which a free particle transport induced by active
fluctuations in the form white Poisson shot noise can be enormously boosted
when the particle is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. In this
work we considerably extend the original predictions and investigate the impact
of statistics of active noise on the occurrence of this effect. We construct a
toy-model of the jump-relaxation process that allow us to identify different
regimes of the free particle transport boost and explain their corresponding
mechanisms. Moreover, we formulate and interpret the conditions for statistics
of active fluctuations that are necessary for the emergence of giant
enhancement of the free particle transport induced by the periodic potential.
Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for
biological ones such as e.g. living cells where fluctuations generated by
metabolic activities are active by default.

<br>
We report on a detailed investigation of the shell-filling sequence in
electrostatically defined bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) in the regime of
low charge carrier occupation, $N < 12$, by means of magnetotransport
spectroscopy. Conductance resonances, so-called Coulomb peaks, appear in groups
of four in gate space in good agreement with spin and valley degenerate orbital
states in bilayer graphene. Interestingly, an additional bunching into pairs of
two is superimposed onto the orbital fourfold degeneracy. We conclude that the
additional splitting is caused by electron-electron interaction leading to a
renormalization of the QD ground state at half filling of each orbital state.
Furthermore, we also report in detail on the influences of the QD geometry on
the energy scales of the electron-electron interaction and the impact of the
magnetic field on the QD states mainly determined by the QD size-dependent
valley $g$-factor.

directly proving the existence of frustration-free parent Hamiltonians, without
appealing to polynomial clustering properties. Furthermore, we show how this
formalism is connected to the existence of a non-local order parameter for
Moore-Read states and give a proof that the latter exhibit off-diagonal

We present ambient and high-pressure electrical transport and structural
properties of recently discovered magnetic Weyl semimetal PrAlGe. Electrical
resistivity at ambient pressure shows an anomaly at $T_C$ = 15.1 K related to
the ferromagnetic transition. Anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is observed below
$T_C$. We observe a 1.4 K/GPa increase of $T_C$ with pressure, resulting in
$T_C$ $\approx$ 47 K at 23.0 GPa. Strong competition between Lorentz force and
spin-scattering mechanisms suppressed by magnetic field is deduced from the
magnetoresistance measurements under pressure. As in the ambient pressure case,
the AHE is found to be present below $T_C$ up to the highest applied pressure.
We observe a clear anomaly in the pressure dependence of $T_C$,
magnetoresistance and Hall effect at 12.5 GPa suggesting the occurrence of a
pressure-induced electronic transition at this pressure. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) experiment under pressure revealed the lattice structure to be stable up
to $\sim$19.6 GPa with the absence of any symmetry changing structural phase
transition from the initial $I4_1md$ structure. Careful analysis of the
pressure dependent XRD data reveal an isostructural transition near 11 GPa.
Observed isostructural transition may be related to the pressure-induced
electronic transition deduced from the magnetoresistance and Hall effect data.

Compositional engineering of the optical properties of hybrid
organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites is one of the cornerstones for the
realization of efficient solar cells and tailored light-emitting devices. We
study the effect of compositional disorder on coherent exciton dynamics in a
mixed FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ perovskite crystal using photon
echo spectroscopy. We reveal that the homogeneous linewidth of excitons can be
as narrow as 16$\mu$eV at a temperature of 1.5K. The corresponding exciton
coherence time of $T_2=83$ps is exceptionally long being attributed to the
localization of excitons due to variation of composition at the scale of ten to
hundreds of nanometers. From spectral and temperature dependences of the two-
and three-pulse photon echo decay we conclude that for low-energy excitons,
pure decoherence associated with elastic scattering on phonons is comparable
with the exciton lifetime, while for excitons with higher energies, inelastic
scattering to lower energy states via phonon emission dominates.

We investigate the stability of MnPb$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$Te$_{6}$ (MPBT), which is
predicted to be a magnetic topological insulator (TI), using density functional
theory calculations. Our analysis includes various measures such as enthalpies
of formation, Helmholtz free energies, defect formation energies, and dynamical
stability. Our thermodynamic analysis shows that the phonon contribution to the
energy gain from finite temperature is estimated to be less than 10~meV/atom,
which may not be sufficient to stabilize MPBT at high temperatures, even with
the most favorable reactions starting from binaries. While MPBT is generally
robust against the formation of various defects, we find that anti-site defect
formation of $\text{Mn}_{\text{Pb}}$ is the most likely to occur, with
corresponding energy less than 60~meV. This can be attributed to the
significant energy cost from compressive strain at the PbTe layer. Our findings
suggest that MPBT is on the brink of stability in terms of thermodynamics and
defect formation, underscoring the importance of conducting systematic analyses
of the stability of proposed TIs, including MPBT, for their practical
utilization. This study offers valuable insights into the design and synthesis
of desirable magnetic TI materials with robust stabilities.

In this paper the random packing fraction of hard disks in a plane is
analyzed, following a geometric probabilistic approach. First, the random close
packing (RCP) of equally sized disks is modelled. Subsequently, following the
same methodology, a simple, statistical geometric model is proposed for the
random loose packing (RLP) of monodisperse disks. This very basic derivation of
RLP leads to a packing value (~ 0.66) that is in very good agreement with
values that have been obtained previously for 2D disk packings. The present
geometrical model also enables closed-form expression for the contact
(coordination) number as function of the packing density at different states of
compaction. These predictions are thoroughly compared with empirical and
simulation results, among others the R\'enyi parking model, yielding good
agreement.

<h3>Self-Consistent Study of the Superconducting Gap in the Strontium-doped  Lanthanum Cuprate</h3>

<br>
<br>
This work is aimed at numerically investigating the behavior of the Fermi
energy in Strontium-doped Lanthanum Cuprate, using a numerical zero temperature
elastic scattering cross-section procedure in the unitary collision regime. The
main task is to vary the zero temperature superconducting energy gap from its
zero value in the normal state, to the highest value of 60 meV. We find that
there are two different reduced phase space regimes for the first harmonic line
node's order parameter. The first scenario considers that when the Fermi energy
and the nearest hopping terms have the same order of magnitude, the physics can
be described by a picture given by nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. A
second scenario indicates, that when the Fermi energy parameter and the hopping
term have different order of magnitude; the physical picture tends to be
related to the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical degrees of freedom coming
from quasi-stationary quantum energy levels, with a damping term seen in the
probability density distribution function, that is described in the
configuration space. Henceforth, it is concluded that the use of the zero
temperature elastic scattering cross-section links the phase and configuration
spaces through the inverse scattering lifetime, and helps to clarify the role
of the degrees of freedom in Strontium-doped Lanthanum Cuprate. Finally, we
think that the self-consistent numerical procedure with the reduced phase
space, induces nonlocality in the inverse scattering lifetime.

The atomic structure of the recently discovered antiferromagnetic
Ga50Pd35.5Tb14.5 2/1 approximant to quasicrystal with the space group of
Pa-3(No. 205), a = 23.1449(0) angstrom was determined by means of a single
crystal X-ray diffraction. The refined structure model revealed two main
building units, namely, a Tsai-type rhombic triacontahedron (RTH) cluster with
three concentric inner shells and an acute rhombohedron filling the gaps in
between the RTH clusters. One of the interesting findings was a very low number
of chemically mixed sites in the structure, which amount to only 7.40 % of the
all the atomic sites within an RTH cluster. In particular, a disorder-free
environment was noticed within a nearest neighbor of an isolated Tb3+ ion,
which is presumably one of the main contributors in enhancing antiferromagnetic
order in the present compound. The second significant finding was the
observance of an orientationally ordered trigonal pyramid-like unit with a
height of 4.2441(7) angstrom at the center of the RTH cluster, which has never
been observed in Tsai-type compounds before. Such unit is noticed to bring
structural distortion to outer shells, in particular, to the surrounding
dodecahedron cage being another possible contributor of the antiferromagnetic
order establishment in the present compound. The results, therefore, are
suggestive of a possible link between chemical/positional order and the
antiferromagnetic order establishment.

<br>
2D ferroelectric \{beta}-InSe/graphene heterostructure was fabricated by
mechanical exfoliation, and the carrier dynamics crossing the heterostructure
interface has been systematically investigated by Raman, photoluminescence and
transient absorption measurements. Due to the efficient interfacial photo
excited electron transfer and photogating effect from trapped holes, the
heterostructure devices demonstrate superior performance with maximum
responsivity of 2.12*10e4 A/W, detectivity of 1.73*10e14 Jones and fast
response time (241 us) under {\lambda} = 532 nm laser illumination.
Furthermore, the photo responses influenced by ferroelectric polarization field
are investigated. Our work confirms ferroelectric \{beta}-InSe/graphene
heterostructure as an outstanding material platform for sensitive
optoelectronic application.

<h3>A simplified method characterizing magnetic ordering modulated  photo-thermoelectric response in noncentrosymmetric semimetal Ca3Ru2O7</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09347" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09347</a>

<br>
<br>
Photo-Thermoelectric (PTE) response is usually one of the main working
mechanisms for photodetectors. However, as another fast and easier way to
measure thermoelectric characteristics of materials, it can also reveal
important physics such as electric-phonon coupling, electron-electron
correlation, etc. Recently, the spin entropy related to magnetic order
transition which contributes to thermoelectric power is attracting more and
more attention. Here, we demonstrate the PTE response can be reshaped when
Ca3Ru2O7 undergoes meta-magnetic phase (MMP) transition driven by both
temperature and magnetic field. Firstly, a sign change is observed crossing TS
= 48 K and the linear polarization angle dependent PTE current maximizes along
a-axis above TS while maximizes along b-axis below TS, which indicates that the
antiferromagnetic spin order contributes to such spatial anisotropy. Secondly,
in the temperature range of around 40 ~ 50 K, the PTE current is found to be
sharply suppressed when external magnetic field is applied in plane along
a-axis but is only gradually suppressed when applied field is along b-axis
which gives out two critical fields. We attribute such suppression of PTE
current under magnetic field to the suppression of the spin entropy in the
phase transition between the antiferromagnetic state and the MMP state and the
H-T phase diagrams of Ca3Ru2O7 is redrawn accordingly. Compared to previously
work which trying to understand the magnetic phase transition in Ca3Ru2O7, such
as neutron scattering, specific heat, and other advanced transport
measurements, our work provides a more convenient yet efficient method, which
may also find applications in other correlated spin materials in general.

We study random velocity effects on a two-species reaction-diffusion system
consisting of three reaction processes $A + A \rightarrow (\varnothing, A),A+B
\rightarrow A$. Using the field-theoretic perturbative renormalization group we
analyze this system in the vicinity of its upper critical dimension $d_c = 2$.
Velocity ensemble is generated by means of stochastic Navier-Stokes equations.
In particular, we investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on reaction
kinetics. The overall analysis is performed to the one-loop approximation and
possible macroscopic regimes are identified.

<h3>Emergent structural correlations in dense liquids</h3>

<br>
<i>Ilian Pihlajamaa, Corentin C.L. Laudicina, Chengjie Luo, Liesbeth M.C. Janssen</i>
<br>
<br>
The complete quantitative description of the structure of dense and
supercooled liquids remains a notoriously difficult problem in statistical
physics. Most studies to date focus solely on two-body structural correlations,
and only a handful of papers have sought to consider additional three-body
correlations. Here, we go beyond the state of the art by extracting many-body
static structure factors from molecular dynamics simulations and by deriving
accurate approximations up to the six-body structure factor via density
functional theory. We find that supercooling manifestly increases four-body
correlations, akin to the two- and three-body case. However, at small wave
numbers, we observe that the four-point structure of a liquid drastically
changes upon supercooling, both qualitatively and quantitatively, which is not
the case in two-point structural correlations. This indicates that theories of
the structure or dynamics of dense liquids should incorporate many-body
correlations beyond the two-particle level to fully capture their intricate
behaviour.

<h3>The unpredicted scaling of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang  equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09358" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09358</a>
<br>
<i>Côme Fontaine, Francesco Vercesi, Marc Brachet, Léonie Canet</i>
<br>
<br>
The celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation describes the kinetic
roughening of stochastically growing interfaces. In one dimension, the KPZ
equation is exactly solvable and its statistical properties are known to an
exquisite degree. Yet recent numerical simulations in the tensionless (or
inviscid) limit of the KPZ equation [Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A {\bf 380}
20210090 (2022), Phys. Rev. E {\bf 106} 024802 (2022)] unveiled a new scaling,
with a critical dynamical exponent $z=1$ different from the KPZ one $z=3/2$. In
this work, we show that this scaling is controlled by a fixed point which had
been missed so far and which corresponds to an infinite effective coupling.
Using the functional renormalization group (FRG), we demonstrate the existence
of this fixed point and show that it yields $z=1$. We calculate the correlation
function and associated scaling function at this fixed point, providing both a
numerical solution of the FRG equations within a reliable approximation, and an
exact asymptotic form obtained in the limit of large wavenumbers. Both scaling
functions accurately match the one from the numerical simulations.

<h3>Non-Hermitian Stark Many-Body Localization</h3>

<br>
<i>Han-Ze Li, Xue-Jia Yu, Jian-Xin Zhong</i>
<br>
<br>
By employing the method of Exact Diagonalization (ED), we examine a
one-dimensional non-Hermitian hard-core boson chain imbued with a Stark
gradient potential and a tail curvature. In this non-Hermitian system, we
witness the occurrence of Many-Body Localization (MBL) phase transitions and
real-complex transitions. Further analysis of the entanglement entropy's
dynamical behavior reveals its similarity with that of disordered-driven
non-Hermitian MBL systems, even though the dynamical response of the real part
of the eigenenergy is less pronounced. We also map out the phase diagrams for
non-Hermitian strength versus Stark gradient potential strength, and
interaction strength versus Stark gradient potential strength, discovering that
an intermediate phase exists in the non-Hermitian Stark MBL system as well.
Overall, our findings provide a new platform for studying disordered-free
non-Hermitian MBL, holding direct relevance to experimental research in
ultracold atomic systems.

<h3>Sublattice Pairing in Pyrochlore Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09409" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09409</a>
<br>
<i>Cecilie Glittum, Olav F. Syljuåsen</i>
<br>
<br>
We argue that classical pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnets with small
further-neighbor couplings can order in a state where pairs of sublattices form
antiparallel spirals. The spiral ordering wave vectors of the two pairs are in
general different from each other, and are constrained by which sublattices are
being paired. This sublattice pairing state generally breaks inversion and most
rotation symmetries. Its existence depends on the antiferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor coupling which favors the spins on each tetrahedron to sum to
zero. To substantiate our argument, we extend the nematic bond theory; a
diagrammatic large-$N_s$ method, to non-Bravais lattices, and demonstrate that
the predicted state is indeed realized at low temperatures in a large region of
exchange coupling space. We also carry out a spin wave calculation which
suggests that the sublattice pairing state is coplanar.

<h3>Novel superfluid states in rotating quantum droplets confined in a  harmonic potential</h3>

<br>
<i>S. Nikolaou, G. M. Kavoulakis, M. Ogren</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the rotational properties of a two-dimensional self-bound
quantum droplet, which is confined in a harmonic potential and compare them
with the well-known problem of a single-component atomic gas, with contact
interactions. For a fixed value of the trap frequency, choosing some
representative values of the atom number, we determine the lowest-energy state,
as the angular momentum increases. For a sufficiently small number of atoms,
the angular momentum is carried via center-of-mass excitation. For larger
values, when the angular momentum is sufficiently small, we observe vortex
excitation, instead. Depending on the actual atom number, one, or more vortices
enter the droplet. Beyond some critical value of the angular momentum, however,
the droplet does not accommodate more vortices and the additional angular
momentum is carried via center-of-mass excitation in a novel, "mixed" state.
Finally, the excitation spectrum is also briefly discussed.

<br>
<br>
I apply the scattering approach within the framework of macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics to derive the variances and mean values of the energy density
and intensity for a system of an arbitrary object in an arbitrary environment.
To evaluate the temporal bunching character of the energy density and
intensity, I determine the ratio of their variances with respect to their mean
values. I explicitly evaluate these ratios for the cases of vacuum, a
half-space in vacuum, and a sphere in vacuum. Eventually, I extend the
applicability of this theory to the case of more than one arbitrary object,
independent of the geometrical shapes and materials.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity  in topological superconductor candidate YPtBi revealed by $^{195}$Pt-NMR</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report $^{195}$Pt nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on
topological superconductor candidate YPtBi which has the broken inversion
symmetry and topological non-trivial band structures due to the strong
spin-orbit coupling(SOC). In the normal state, we find that Knight shift $K$ is
field- and temperature-independent, suggesting that the contribution from the
topological bands is very small at low temperatures. However, the spin-lattice
relaxation rate 1/$T_1$ divided by temperature ($T$), 1/$T_1T$, increases with
decreasing $T$, implying the existence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.
In the superconducting state, no Hebel-Slichter coherence peak is seen below
$T_{\rm c}$ and 1/$T_1$ follows $T^{3}$ variation, indicating the
unconventional superconductivity. The finite spin susceptibility at
zero-temperature limit and the anomalous increase of the NMR line width below
$T_{\rm c}$ point to a mixed state of spin-singlet and spin-triplet(or
spin-septet) pairing.

<h3>Two-dimensional symbiotic solitons and quantum droplets in a  quasi-one-dimensional optical lattice</h3>

<i>S. M. Al-Marzoug, B. B. Baizakov, H. Bahlouli</i>
<br>
<br>
Symbiotic solitons (SS) and quantum droplets (QD) are self-trapped localized
modes emerging in binary Bose-gas mixtures with intra-component repulsion and
inter-component attraction. We have shown that two-dimensional SS can be
stabilized against collapse or decay by means of a quasi-one-dimensional
optical lattice (OL). Mobility of SSs along the free direction of the potential
allows us to explore interactions and collisions of SSs moving in the same
channel and neighboring channels of the quasi-1D OL. For the case of equal atom
numbers in both components of the binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) we have
developed a variational approach that showed the stability of SS. For parameter
settings when the SS stays on the verge of collapse instability, we take into
account the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluctuations (QF) term in the coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Repulsive QF prevents the mean-field collapse and
gives rise to the formation of 2D QDs with peculiar properties such as
incompressibility and surface tension, which are inherent to liquids. The
proposed model of binary BEC loaded in a quasi-1D OL allows us to demonstrate
the manifestations of the incompressibility and surface tension of 2D QDs. The
formation of QD in imbalanced binary BEC with different numbers of atoms of the
components in the presence of a quasi-1D OL has been investigated. The possible
application of the proposed model to studies of anisotropic superfluidity is
discussed.

<h3>Unconventional phonon spectra and obstructed edge phonon modes</h3>

<br>
Based on the elementary band representations (eBR), some topologically
trivial materials are classified as unconventional ones (obstructed atomic
limit), where the eBR decomposition of electronic states is not consistent with
the atomic valence-electron band representations. In the work, we identify that
the unconventional nature can also exist in phonon spectra, where the eBR
decomposition of the phonon modes is not consistent with atomic vibration band
representations (aBR). The unconventionality has two types: type I is on an
empty site; type II is on an atom site with non-atomic vibration orbitals. Our
detailed calculations show that black phosphorus (BP) and 1H-MoSe$_2$ have
unconventional both phonon spectra and electronic band structures. The BP has
the type-I unconventional phonon spectrum, while 1H-MoSe$_2$ has the type-II
one. The obstructed phonon modes are obtained for two types of unconventional
phonon spectra.

We report on Monte-Carlo simulations of the six-vertex model with domain wall
boundary conditions. In thermal equilibrium such boundary conditions force a
fluctuating line separating the disordered region from the perfectly ordered
ones. Specifically we study the ice point at which all vertex weights are
equal. With high precision the one-point fluctuations of the line are confirmed
to be of order $N^{1/3}$ and governed by the Tracy-Widom distribution.
Furthermore, the non-universal scaling coefficients are computed for a wide
range of interaction strengths. A draft of this paper was completed in January
2019. We improved the presentation and updated references.

<br>
<br>
We investigate spin-charge separation of a spin-1/2 Fermi system confined in
a triple well where multiple bands are occupied. We assume that our finite
fermionic system is close to fully spin polarized while being doped by a hole
and an impurity fermion with opposite spin. Our setup involves ferromagnetic
couplings among the particles in different bands, leading to the development of
strong spin-transport correlations in an intermediate interaction regime.
Interactions are then strong enough to lift the degeneracy among singlet and
triplet spin configurations in the well of the spin impurity but not strong
enough to prohibit hole-induced magnetic excitations to the singlet state.
Despite the strong spin-hole correlations, the system exhibits spin-charge
deconfinement allowing for long-range entanglement of the spatial and spin
degrees of freedom.

The identification of topological superconductors usually involves searching
for in-gap modes that are protected by topology. However, in the current
experimental settings, the smoking-gun evidence of these in-gap modes is still
lacking. In this work, we propose to distinguish between two-dimensional
conventional s-wave and topological p-wave superconductors by above-gap
transport signatures. Our method utilizes the emergence of Tomasch oscillations
of quasiparticles in a junction consisting of a superconductor sandwiched
between two metallic leads. We demonstrate that the behavior of the
oscillations in conductance as a function of the interface barriers provides a
distinctive signature for s-wave and p-wave superconductors. Specifically, the
oscillations become weaker as the barrier strength increases in s-wave
superconductors, while they become more pronounced in p-wave superconductors,
which we prove to be a direct manifestation of the pairing symmetries. Our
method opens a new route for identifying topological superconductors through
above-gap transport.

<br>
<br>
CoSn is a prototypical kagome compound showing lattice-born flat bands with
suppressed bandwidth over large parts of the Brillouin zone. Here, by means of
time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence
of the response to photoexcitation of the flat bands, that underlie information
about localization in real space. In particular, we detect a sudden shift and
broadening of the flat bands, while after one picosecond only a broadening
survives. We ascribe both these effects to an ultrafast disruption of electron
localization, which renormalizes the effective electron-electron interaction
and affects the flat band dispersion. Since both variations are in the order of
a few meV, our measurements suggest that the flat bands are resilient to
near-infrared photoexcitation.

<h3>Plasmons in phosphorene nanoribbons</h3>

<br>
<br>
Phosphorene has emerged as an atomically-thin platform for optoelectronics
and nanophotonics due to its excellent nonlinear optical properties and the
possibility of actively tuning light-matter interactions through electrical
doping. While phosphorene is a two-dimensional semiconductor, plasmon
resonances characterized by pronounced anisotropy and strong optical
confinement are anticipated to emerge in highly-doped samples. Here we show
that the localized plasmons supported by phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) exhibit
high tunability in relation to both edge termination and doping charge
polarity, and can trigger an intense nonlinear optical response at moderate
doping levels. Our explorations are based on a second-principles theoretical
framework, employing maximally localized Wannier functions constructed from
ab-inito electronic structure calculations, which we introduce here to describe
the linear and nonlinear optical response of PNRs on mesoscopic length scales.
Atomistic simulations reveal the high tunability of plasmons in doped PNRs at
near-infrared frequencies, which can facilitate synergy between electronic band
structure and plasmonic field confinement in doped PNRs to drive efficient
high-harmonic generation. Our findings establish phosphorene nanoribbons as a
versatile atomically-thin material candidate for nonlinear plasmonics.

<h3>Phase diagram and superconductivity of Calcium Alanates under pressure</h3>

<i>Simone Di Cataldo, Lilia Boeri</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we present a first-principles study of the high-pressure
superconducting phase diagram of calcium alanates (Ca-Al-H), based on ab-initio
crystal structure prediction and anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg Theory. Calcium
alanates have been intensively studied at ambient pressure for their
hydrogen-storage properties, but their high-pressure behavior is largely
unknown. By performing a full scan of the ternary convex hull at several
pressures between 0 and 300 GPa, we identify several new structural motifs,
characterized by a high Al-H coordination, where Al--$d$ orbitals participate
in the bonding. Among all new phases thus identified, we focus in particular on
a phase with CaAlH$_7$ composition, which lies on the convex hull at 300 GPa,
and remains dynamically stable down to 50 GPa, with a predicted superconducting
T$_c$ of 82 K, which likely represents a new promising template to achieve
increase chemical precompression in ternary hydrides. Our findings reveal
important insights into the structure-property relationships of calcium
alanates under high pressure, and highlight a possible strategy to achieve
conventional superconductivity at low pressures.

In this work, we present an analytical study on the surface plasmon
polaritons in a two dimensional parity anomaly Chern insulator. The connections
between the topology in the bulk implied by the BHZ model and the dispersion
relations of the surface plasmons have been revealed. Anisotropy has been
considered during the calculations of the dispersion relations which allows
different permittivities perpendicular to the conductive plane. Two surface
plasmon modes each contains two branches of dispersion relations have been
found. The topologically non-trivial case gives quite different Hall
conductivities compared with the trivial one, which leads to significant
modifications of the dispersion curves or even the absence of particular branch
of the surface plasmons. Our investigations pave a possible way for the
detection of the parity anomaly in a two-dimensional Chern insulator via
plasmonic responses.

Thermally-induced transitions between bistable magnetic states of magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJ) are of interest for generating random bitstreams and for
applications in stochastic computing. An applied field transverse to the easy
axis of a perpendicularly magnetized MTJ (pMTJ) can lower the energy barrier
($E_b$) to these transitions leading to faster fluctuations. In this study, we
present analytical and numerical calculations of $E_b$ considering both
coherent (macrospin) reversal and non-uniform wall-mediated magnetization
reversal for a selection of nanodisk diameters and applied fields. Non-uniform
reversal processes dominate for larger diameters, and our numerical
calculations of $E_b$ using the String method show that the transition state
has a sigmoidal magnetization profile. The latter can be described with an
analytical expression that depends on only one spatial dimension, parallel to
the applied field, which is also the preferred direction of profile motion
during reversal. Our results provide nanodisk energy barriers as a function of
the transverse field, nanodisk diameter, and material characteristics, which
are useful for designing stochastic bitstreams.

<h3>Stochastic thermodynamics of multiple co-evolving systems -- beyond  multipartite processes</h3>

<i>Farita Tasnim, David H. Wolpert</i>
<br>
<br>
Many dynamical systems consist of multiple, co-evolving subsystems (degrees
of freedom). These subsystems often depend upon each other in a way that
restricts the overall system's dynamics. How does this network of dependencies
affect the system's thermodynamics? Prior studies in the stochastic
thermodynamics of multipartite processes (MPPs) have approached these questions
by restricting the system to allow only one subsystem to change state at a
time. However, in many real systems, such as chemical reaction networks or
electronic circuits, multiple subsystems must change state together. Therefore,
studies of MPPs do not apply to such systems. Here, we investigate the
thermodynamics of composite processes, in which subsets of subsystems are
allowed to change state simultaneously. These subsets correspond to the
subsystems that interact with a single mechanism (e.g., a thermal or chemical
reservoir) that is coupled to the system. An MPP is simply a (subcase of a)
composite process in which all such subsets have cardinality one. We
demonstrate the power of the composite systems framework to study the
thermodynamics of multiple, co-evolving subsystems. In particular, we derive
thermodynamic uncertainty relations for information flows in composite
processes. We also derive strengthened speed limits for composite processes.
Our results apply to a much broader class of dynamical systems than do results
for MPPs, and could guide future studies of the thermodynamics of distributed
computational systems.

<h3>Interfacing branching random walks with Metropolis sampling: constraint  release in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09575" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09575</a>
<br>
<i>Zhi-Yu Xiao, Hao Shi, Shiwei Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an approach to interface branching random walks with Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling, and to switch seamlessly between the two. The approach is
discussed in the context of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) but is
applicable to other Monte Carlo calculations or simulations. In AFQMC, the
formulation of branching random walks along imaginary-time is needed to realize
a constraint to control the sign or phase problem. The constraint is derived
from an exact gauge condition, and is in practice implemented approximately
with a trial wave function or trial density matrix, which can break exactness
in the algorithm. We use the generalized Metropolis algorithm to sample a
selected portion of the imaginary-time path after it has been produced by the
branching random walk. This interfacing allows a constraint release to follow
seamlessly from the constrained-path sampling, which can reduce the systematic
error from the latter. It also provides a way to improve the computation of
correlation functions and observables that do not commute with the Hamiltonian.
We illustrate the method in atoms and molecules, where improvements in accuracy
can be clearly quantified and near-exact results are obtained. We also discuss
the computation of the variance of the Hamiltonian and propose a convenient way
to evaluate it stochastically without changing the scaling of AFQMC.

$BaWO_{4}$, $Ce_{2/3}\square_{1/3}WO_{4}$ and $La_{2/3}\square_{1/3}WO_{4}$
polycrystalline ceramics were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction
route. The effect of cation-deficiency on the crystallographic structure,
microstructure and thermal properties of these scheelite-type compounds were
investigated. X-ray diffraction was used to identify the single-phase scheelite
structure of the studied ceramics. Scanning Electron Microscopy technique has
revealed a homogenous and dense microstructure with a few micro-cracks. The
thermal conductivity of $BaWO_{4}$ scheelite decreases from $1.3\pm0.2$ to
$1.0\pm0.1 W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ in the range 373 K - 673 K. The cation-deficient
scheelites $Ce_{2/3}\square_{1/3}WO_{4}$ and $La_{2/3}\square_{1/3}WO_{4}$
ceramics display an ultra-low thermal conductivity of $0.3\pm0.04 W m^{-1}
K^{-1}$ and $0.2\pm0.03 W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 673 K, respectively. These
materials exhibit among the lowest known values of thermal conductivity in
crystalline oxides, in this temperature range. Therefore, they appear as very
attractive for thermal barrier coating and thermoelectric applications.

Phononic crystals (PnCs) are artificially patterned media exhibiting bands of
allowed and forbidden zones for phonons. Many emerging applications of PnCs
from solid-state simulators to quantum memories could benefit from the
on-demand tunability of the phononic band structure. Here, we demonstrate the
fabrication of suspended graphene PnCs in which the phononic band structure is
controlled by mechanical tension applied electrostatically. We show signatures
of a mechanically tunable phononic band gap. The experimental data supported by
simulation suggest a phononic band gap at 28$-$33 MHz in equilibrium, which
upshifts by 9 MHz under a mechanical tension of 3.1 Nm$^{-1}$. This is an
essential step towards tunable phononics paving the way for more experiments on
phononic systems based on 2D materials.

High-transition-temperature (high-T_c) superconductivity in cuprates has been
discovered for more than three decades, but the underlying mechanism remains a
mystery. Cuprates are the only unconventional superconducting family that host
bulk superconductivity with T_cs above the liquid nitrogen boiling temperature
at 77 Kelvin. Here we report an observation of superconductivity in single
crystals of La3Ni2O7 with a maximum T_c of 80 Kelvin at pressures between
14.0-43.5 gigapascals using high-pressure resistance and mutual inductive
magnetic susceptibility measurements. The superconducting phase under high
pressure exhibits an orthorhombic structure of Fmmm space group with the
3d_(x^2-y^2 ) and 3d_(z^2 ) orbitals of Ni cations strongly interacting with
oxygen 2p orbitals. Our density functional theory calculations suggest the
superconductivity emerges coincidently with the metallization of the
{\sigma}-bonding bands under the Fermi level, consisting of the 3d_(z^2 )
orbitals with the apical oxygens connecting Ni-O bilayers. Thus, our
discoveries not only reveal important clues for the high-T_c superconductivity
in this Ruddlesden-Popper double-layered perovskite nickelates but also provide
a new family of compounds to investigate the high-T_c superconductivity
mechanism.

In this work we present a detailed analysis on the performance of X-ray
magnetic circular dichroism photo-emission electron microscopy (XMCD-PEEM) as a
tool for vector reconstruction of the magnetization. For this, we choose
360$^{\circ}$ domain wall ring structures which form in a synthetic
antiferromagnet as our model to conduct the quantitative analysis. We assess
how the quality of the results is affected depending on the number of
projections that are involved in the reconstruction process, as well as their
angular distribution. For this we develop a self-consistent error metric, which
indicates that the main factor of improvement comes from selecting the
projections evenly spread out in space, over having a larger number of these
spanning a smaller angular range. This work thus poses XMCD-PEEM as a powerful
tool for vector imaging of complex 3D magnetic structures.

<h3>Effects of the two-dimensional Coulomb interaction in both Fermi  velocity and energy gap for Dirac-like electrons at finite temperature</h3>

We describe both the Fermi velocity and the mass renormalization due to the
two-dimensional Coulomb interaction in the presence of a thermal bath. To
achieve this, we consider an anisotropic version of pseudo quantum
electrodynamics (PQED), within a perturbative approach in the fine-structure
constant $\alpha$. Thereafter, we use the so-called imaginary-time formalism
for including the thermal bath. In the limit $T\rightarrow 0$, we calculate the
renormalized mass $m^R(p)$ and compare this result with the experimental
findings for the energy band gap in monolayers of transition metal
dichalcogenides, namely, WSe$_2$ and MoS$_2$. In these materials, the
quasi-particle excitations behave as a massive Dirac-like particles in the
low-energy limit, hence, its mass is related to the energy band gap of the
material. In the low-temperature limit $T\ll v_F p $, where $v_F p$ is taken as
the Fermi energy, we show that $m^R(p)$ decreases linearly on the temperature,
i.e, $m^R(p,T)-m^R(p,T\rightarrow 0)\approx -A_\alpha T +O(T^3)$, where
$A_\alpha$ is a positive constant. On the other hand, for the renormalized
Fermi velocity, we find that $v^R_F(p,T)-v^R_F(p,T\rightarrow 0)\approx
-B_\alpha T^3 +O(T^5)$, where $B_\alpha$ is a positive constant. We also
perform numerical tests which confirm our analytical results.

<h3>Non-trivial Flat Bands in Three Dimensions</h3>

We report the presence of exactly and nearly flat bands with non-trivial
topology in a three-dimensional lattice model. We first show that an
approximate flat band with finite Chern number can be realized in a two-orbital
square lattice by tuning the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor hopping
between the two orbitals. With this, we construct a minimal three-dimensional
flat band model without stacking the two-dimensional (2D) layers. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a genuine three dimensional non-trivial insulating phase
can be realized by allowing only nearest and next-nearest hopping among
different orbitals in the third direction. We find both perfect and nearly
perfect flat bands in all three planes at some special parameter values. While
nearly flat bands carries a finite Chern number, the perfect flat band carries
zero Chern number. Further, we show that such a three dimensional (3D)
insulators with flat bands carry an additional three dimensional topological
invariant, namely Hopf invariant. Finally, we show that a 3D construction of
lattice model with Hopf invariant from a 2D Chern insulator is model specific
and appearance of flat bands is not guaranteed in the Hopf-Chern system with
only nearest and next-nearest hopping among distinct orbitals.

<h3>Record Ages of non-Markovian Random Walks</h3>

How long is needed for an observable to exceed its previous highest value and
establish a new record? This time, known as the age of a record, has given rise
to a growing number of theoretical studies in recent years. Its importance
stems from its crucial role in quantifying record statistics in fields as
diverse as physics, finance or climate studies. Until now, general methods for
determining record age statistics have been limited to observations of either
independent random variables or successive positions of a Markovian
(memoryless) random walk (RW) . However, as soon as the evolution of a given
observable results from the interaction with hidden degrees of freedom, memory
effects cannot be neglected. Examples of time series involving memory effects
include data of soil and air temperatures, river flows, nucleotide sequence
locations and Ethernet traffic.
Here we develop a theoretical framework to determine record age statistics in
the presence of memory effects. Our analytical approach shows that the
algebraic decay of the record age distribution is strongly influenced by the
past and is characterized by an explicitly determined exponent. These
theoretical predictions are confirmed by both numerical simulations and
experiments on diverse representative non-Markovian RW models. We further
demonstrate the practical relevance of our results by showing that they also
apply to real time series with memory effects, in fields as diverse as
genomics, climatology, hydrology, geology and computer science. Our results
reveal the crucial role of the number of records already achieved in time
series and change our view on analysing record statistics.

Herein, we report a minireview to give a brief introduction of applications
of nanomaterials in the field of forensic science. The materials that have
their size in nanoscale (1 - 100 nm) comes under the category of nanomaterials.
Nanomaterials possess various applications in different fields like cosmetic
production, medical, photoconductivity etc. because of their physio-chemical,
electrical and magnetic properties. Due to the different characteristic
property that nanomaterials have, they are widely employed in diverse domains.
In various fields of forensic science such as fingerprints, toxicology,
medicine, serology, nanomaterials are being used extensively. Large surface
area to volume ratio of the materials in nano-regime makes the nanomaterials
suitable for all these application with high efficiency. This review article
briefs about the nanomaterials, their advantages and their novel applications
in various fields, focusing especially in the field of forensic science. The
basic idea of different areas of forensic science such as development of
fingerprints, detection of drugs, estimating the time since death, analysis of
GSR, detection of various explosives and for the extraction of DNA etc. has
also been provided.
