<h3>Intercomparison exercise on Monte Carlo simulations of electron spectra  and energy depositions by a single gold nanoparticle under X-ray irradiation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13813" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13813</a>

<p>Computational approaches, such as Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport
simulations, are used to estimate the dosimetric effects of GNPs, where results
differing by orders of magnitudes have been reported by different
investigators. This has motivated an intercomparison exercise, which was
conducted as a joint activity of EURADOS Working Groups 6 "Computational
Dosimetry" and 7 "Internal Dosimetry". The aim of this exercise was to
determine the extent of such discrepancies between the results obtained by
different researchers and different codes in a very simple simulation setup.
Several individual EURADOS associate members and two code developer groups
from outside Europe participated in this exercise applying seven different MC
codes to perform the simulations of a simple defined geometry set-up of one
single GNP irradiated in water by kilo-voltage X-rays. Two GNP diameters of 50
nm and 100 nm of were considered and two photon spectra as generated by X-ray
tubes operated at 50 kV and 100 kV peak voltages. The geometry set-up and X-ray
spectra were provided by the EURADOS task group. The participants were asked to
determine for each combination of GNP size and X-ray spectrum the dose
enhancement ratio (DER) of 10 nm-thick water shells up to 1000 nm and 1
$\mu$m-thick water shells up to 50 $\mu$m around the GNP. Furthermore, the
electron spectra emitted from the GNP and the energy depositions in water
shells around it were also to be reported.
This EURADOS report summarizes the motivation and background for the
exercise, the tasks to be solved, the codes used, the results reported by the
participants, the consistency checks applied in their evaluation and a best
estimates and uncertainty bands derived from the final results for the energy
spectra of emitted electrons and the energy imparted in the vicinity of the
GNP.

<h3>DyFeO3 electrode material with ultra-wide voltage window for aqueous  symmetric supercapacitors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13814" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13814</a>

<p>Aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) encounter limitations in operational voltage
and energy density due to the low decomposition voltage of water. Here, we
fabricate aqueous symmetric supercapacitors (ASSCs) employing DyFeO3 as an
electrode material. This hybrid SC in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte
exhibits a significantly high working voltage of 2.5 V, with an energy density
of 41.81 Wh/kg at a power density of 1250 W/kg, maintaining 94% capacitance
retention after 5000 cycles. By incorporating 20% volume of acetonitrile with
water in the electrolyte, we extend the potential window to 3.1 V, with an
energy density of 84.43 Wh/kg at a power density of 1550 W/kg. The
as-fabricated ASSC shows promising stability during a 300-hour float voltage
test with almost intact capacitance retention and Coulombic efficiency. For the
first time, our study unveils the potential of porous DyFeO3 as an electrode
material for advancing ASSCs, featuring an unprecedented ultra-wide voltage
window, along with significantly large energy and power densities.

<h3>Autonomous microARPES</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13815" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13815</a>
<br>
</p><i>Steinn Ymir Agustsson, Alfred J. H. Jones, Davide Curcio, Søren Ulstrup, Jill Miwa, Davide Mottin, Panagiotis Karras, Philip Hofmann</i>
<p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a technique used to map
the occupied electronic structure of solids. Recent progress in X-ray focusing
optics has led to the development of ARPES into a microscopic tool, permitting
the electronic structure to be spatially mapped across the surface of a sample.
This comes at the expense of a time-consuming scanning process to cover not
only a three-dimensional energy-momentum ($E, k_z, k_y$) space but also the
two-dimensional surface area. Here, we implement a protocol to autonomously
search both $\mathbf{k}$- and real space in order to find positions of
particular interest, either because of their high photoemission intensity or
because of sharp spectral features. The search is based on the use of Gaussian
process regression and can easily be expanded to include additional parameters
or optimisation criteria. This autonomous experimental control is implemented
on the SGM4 micro-focus beamline of the synchrotron radiation source ASTRID2.

<h3>Combined X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and $ab$ $initio$  study of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ under pressure: implications to the unified phase  diagram</h3>

<p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the
quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the
variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the
crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a
diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform
first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$
$initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the
behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell
and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by
the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as
follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the
volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer
integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb
interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect.
ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the
result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in
the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain
transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The
results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and
the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement:
The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin
ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the
similarities and differences between applying external pressure and
substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).

<h3>Exploring magnetic anisotropy in bcc-structured ferromagnetic thin films  with three spin layers using the fourth order perturbed Heisenberg  Hamiltonian</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13817</a>
<br>
</p><i>M.S.M. Farhan</i>
<p>This study investigates into the analysis of ferromagnetic thin films with a
body centered cubic lattice and three spin layers, utilizing the solution of
the fourth-order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian equation with seven magnetic
energy parameters. Spin-exchange interaction, magnetic dipole interaction,
second-order magnetic anisotropy,fourth-order magnetic anisotropy, applied
magnetic field, demagnetization energy, and stress-induced anisotropy were all
taken into account. According to 3D plots, the minimum order of energy was
observed when the second order magnetic anisotropy constant in the middle spin
layer is less than those of the bottom and top spin layers. In all cases, the
values of stress-induced anisotropy at the maxima of 3D plots are exactly the
same when the values of the second-order magnetic anisotropy constants of the
bottom, middle, and top spin layers are interchanged with each other. In 2D
plots, the angle between consecutive magnetic easy and hard directions is
approximately 90 degrees in all cases. Additionally, the magnetic easy and hard
directions were observed to have exactly the same values when the second-order
magnetic anisotropy constant of the spin layers changes. These results were
compared with the results obtained using the second and third order perturbed
Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

<h3>Experimental Investigation of an Incremental Contact Model for  Hyperelastic Solids Using In-Situ Optical Interferometric Technique</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13818</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chunyun Jiang, Yanbin Zheng</i>
<p>The hyperelastic materials would contribute to the intricacies of rough
surface contact, primarily due to the heightened nonlinearity caused by stress
concentration. In our previous research, an incremental contact model tailored
for hyperelastic materials is proposed and validated by finite element (FEM)
simulations. From an experimental perspective, this study employs an in-situ
optical interferometric technique to precisely document the actual contact zone
between hyperelastic solids and quartz glass. Simultaneously, the contact force
is meticulously recorded in sync by a force sensor positioned beneath the
hyperelastic samples. Comparing with the predictions of incremental contact
model for hyperelastic materials, a significant agreement becomes evident,
almost in a range of nearly complete contact. Its significance extends to
practical domains such as sealing mechanisms, leakage prevention, and
structural integrity, offering valuable insights for these applications.

<h3>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ramanjit Sohal, Abhinav Prem</i>
<p>We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D)
topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that
the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological
order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground
state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence,
previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is
more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out"
anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons
generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric
under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking
connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem
codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders.
Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a
classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and
even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered
states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a
partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.

<h3>Topological Dipole Insulator</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13880</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ho Tat Lam, Jung Hoon Han, Yizhi You</i>
<p>We expand the concept of two-dimensional topological insulators to encompass
a novel category known as topological dipole insulators (TDIs), characterized
by conserved dipole moments along the $x$-direction in addition to charge
conservation. By generalizing Laughlin's flux insertion argument, we prove a
no-go theorem and predict possible edge patterns and anomalies in a TDI with
both charge $U^e(1)$ and dipole $U^d(1)$ symmetries. The edge of a TDI is
characterized as a quadrupolar channel that displays a dipole $U^d(1)$ anomaly.
A quantized amount of dipole gets transferred between the edges under the
dipolar flux insertion, manifesting as `quantized quadrupolar Hall effect' in
TDIs. A microscopic coupled-wire Hamiltonian realizing the TDI is constructed
by introducing a mutually commuting pair-hopping terms between wires to gap out
all the bulk modes while preserving the dipole moment. The effective action at
the quadrupolar edge can be derived from the wire model, with the corresponding
bulk dipolar Chern-Simons response theory delineating the topological
electromagnetic response in TDIs. Finally, we enrich our exploration of
topological dipole insulators to the spinful case and construct a dipolar
version of the quantum spin Hall effect, whose boundary evidences a mixed
anomaly between spin and dipole symmetry. Effective bulk and the edge action
for the dipolar quantum spin Hall insulator are constructed as well.

<h3>Large Exciton Binding Energy in the Bulk van der Waals Magnet CrSBr</h3>

<p>Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, influence the optical properties in
strongly interacting solid state systems. Excitons and their associated
many-body physics are typically most stable and pronounced in monolayer
materials. Bulk systems with large exciton binding energies, on the other hand,
are rare and the mechanisms driving their stability are still relatively
unexplored. Here, we report an exceptionally large exciton binding energy in
single crystals of the bulk van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. Utilizing
state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and self-consistent
ab-initio GW calculations, we present direct spectroscopic evidence that robust
electronic and structural anisotropy can significantly amplify the exciton
binding energy within bulk crystals. Furthermore, the application of a vertical
electric field enables broad tunability of the optical and electronic
properties. Our results indicate that CrSBr is a promising material for the
study of the role of anisotropy in strongly interacting bulk systems and for
the development of exciton-based optoelectronics.

<h3>Nonequilibrium quantum heat transport between structured environments</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13904" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13904</a>
<br>
</p><i>Graeme Pleasance, Francesco Petruccione</i>
<p>We apply the hierarchical equations of motion technique to analyzing
nonequilibrium heat transport in a spin-boson type model, whereby heat transfer
through a central spin is mediated by an intermediate pair of coupled harmonic
oscillators. The coupling between each pair of oscillators is shown to
introduce a localized gap into the effective spectral densities characterizing
the system-oscillator-reservoir interactions. Compared to the case of a single
mediating oscillator, we find the heat current to be drastically modified at
weak system-bath coupling. In particular, a second-order treatment fails to
capture the correct steady-state behavior in this regime, which stems from the
$\lambda^4$-scaling of the energy transfer rate to lowest order in the coupling
strength $\lambda$. This leads naturally to a strong suppression in the
steady-state current in the asymptotically weak coupling limit. On the other
hand, the current noise follows the same scaling as in the single oscillator
case in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, we
find the heat current to be consistent with Fourier's law even at large
temperature bias. Our analysis highlights a novel mechanism for controlling
heat transport in nanoscale systems based on tailoring the spectral properties
of thermal environments.

<h3>Needle in a haystack: efficiently finding atomically defined quantum  dots for electrostatic force microscopy</h3>

</p><i>José Bustamante, Yoichi Miyahara, Logan Fairgrieve-Park, Kieran Spruce, Patrick See, Neil Curson, Taylor Stock, Peter Grutter</i>
<p>The ongoing development of single electron, nano and atomic scale
semiconductor devices would benefit greatly from a characterization tool
capable of detecting single electron charging events with high spatial
resolution, at low temperature. In this work, we introduce a novel Atomic Force
Microscope (AFM) instrument capable of measuring critical device dimensions,
surface roughness, electrical surface potential, and ultimately the energy
levels of quantum dots and single electron transistors in ultra miniaturized
semiconductor devices. Characterization of nanofabricated devices with this
type of instrument presents a challenge: finding the device. We therefore also
present a process to efficiently find a nanometre size quantum dot buried in a
$10 \times 10~\text{mm}^2$ silicon sample using a combination of optical
positioning, capacitive sensors and AFM topography in vacuum.

<h3>Complex Dynamics of an Acoustically Levitated Fluid Droplet Captured by  a Low-Order Immersed Boundary Method</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13943" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13943</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jacqueline B. Sustiel, David G. Grier</i>
<p>We present a novel immersed boundary method that implements acoustic
perturbation theory to model an acoustically levitated droplet. Instead of
resolving sound waves numerically, our hybrid method solves acoustic scattering
semi-analytically and models the corresponding time-averaged acoustic forces on
the droplet. This framework allows the droplet to be simulated on inertial
timescales of interest, and thereby admit a much larger time resolution than
traditional compressible flow solvers. To benchmark this technique and
demonstrate its utility, we implement the hybrid IBM for a single droplet in a
standing wave. Simulated droplet shape deformations and streaming profile agree
with theoretical predictions. Our simulations also yield new insights on the
streaming profiles for elliptical droplets, for which a comprehensive analytic
solution does not exist.

<h3>Emission of fast-propagating spin waves by an antiferromagnetic domain  wall driven by spin current</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13949" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13949</a>
<br>
</p><i>Roman V. Ovcharov, B. A. Ivanov, Johan Åkerman, Roman S. Khymyn</i>
<p>Antiferromagnets (AFMs) have great benefits for spintronic applications such
as high frequencies (up to THz), high speeds (up to tens of km/s) of magnetic
excitations, and field-free operation. Advanced devices will require high-speed
propagating spin waves (SWs) as signal carriers, i.e., SWs with high k-vectors,
the excitation of which remains challenging. We show that a domain wall (DW) in
anisotropic AFM driven by the spin current can be a source of such propagating
SWs with high frequencies and group velocities. In the proposed generator, the
spin current, with polarization directed along the easy anisotropy axis,
excites the precession of the N\'eel vector within the DW. The threshold
current is defined by the value of the anisotropy in the hard plane, and the
frequency of the DW precession is tuneable by the strength of the spin current.
We show that the above precession of spins inside the DW leads to robust
emission of high-frequency propagating SWs into the AFM strip with very short
wavelengths comparable to the exchange length, which is hard to achieve by any
other method.

<p>A mirror twin boundary (MTB) in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
monolayer can host one-dimensional electron liquid of a topological nature with
tunable interactions. Unfortunately, the electrical characterization of such
boundaries has been challenging due to the paucity of samples with large enough
size and high quality. Here, we report an epitaxial growth of monolayer
molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) bicrystals with well-isolated MTBs that are tens
of micrometers long. Conductance measurements of these MTBs exhibit power-law
behaviors as a function of temperature and bias voltage up to room temperature,
consistent with electrons tunneling into a Luttinger liquid. Transport
measurements of two distinct types of MTBs reveal the critical role of the
atomic-scale defects. This study demonstrates that MTBs in TMD monolayers
provide an exciting new platform for studying the interplay between electronic
interactions and topology.

<h3>Meta-plasticity and memory in multi-level recurrent feed-forward  networks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13967" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13967</a>
<br>
</p><i>Gianmarco Zanardi, Paolo Bettotti, Jules Morand, Lorenzo Pavesi, Luca Tubiana</i>
<p>Network systems can exhibit memory effects in which the interactions between
different pairs of nodes adapt in time, leading to the emergence of preferred
connections, patterns, and sub-networks. To a first approximation, this memory
can be modelled through a ``plastic'' Hebbian or homophily mechanism, in which
edges get reinforced proportionally to the amount of information flowing
through them. However, recent studies on glia-neuron networks have highlighted
how memory can evolve due to more complex dynamics, including multi-level
network structures and ``meta-plastic'' effects that modulate reinforcement.
Inspired by those systems, here we develop a simple and general model for the
dynamics of an adaptive network with an additional meta-plastic mechanism that
varies the rate of Hebbian strengthening of its edge connections. Specifically,
we consider a biased random walk on a cyclic feed-forward network. The random
walk chooses its steps according to the weights of the network edges. The
weights evolve through a Hebbian mechanism modulated by a meta-plastic
reinforcement, biasing the walker to prefer edges that have been already
explored. We study the dynamical emergence (memorization) of preferred paths
and their retrieval and identify three regimes: one dominated by the Hebbian
term, one in which the meta-reinforcement drives memory formation, and a
balanced one. We show that, in the latter two regimes, meta-reinforcement
allows for the retrieval of a previously stored path even after weights have
been reset to zero to erase Hebbian memory.

<h3>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</a>
<br>
</p><i>Paul Tangney</i>
<p>I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates
of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric
potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some
foundations of a general theory of structure homogenization, meaning a theory
of how any observable macroscopic field is related to spatial averages of its
microscopic counterpart.
I apply homogenization theory to the fields that appear in the vacuum theory
of electromagnetism and deduce that the relationships between macroscopic
fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic
counterparts. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for
polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove
that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in
a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a
crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of
macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the
microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot
be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density is
isotropic in the bulks of most materials, because it vanishes at every point.
Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic electric field
cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable
macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the
polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither
of which is observable.

<h3>First-principles studies of Schottky barriers and tunneling properties  at Al(111)/Si(111) and CoSi$_2$(111)/Si(111) interfaces</h3>

<br>
</p><i>J. K. Nangoi, C. J. Palmstrøm, C. G. Van de Walle</i>
<p>We present first-principles calculations of Schottky barrier heights (SBHs)
at interfaces relevant for silicon-based merged-element transmon qubit devices.
Focusing on Al(111)/Si(111) and CoSi$_2$(111)/Si(111), we consider various
possible interfacial structures, for which we study the relaxations of the
atoms near the interface, calculate the formation energies and Schottky barrier
heights, and provide estimates of the Josephson critical currents based on the
WKB tunneling formalism as implemented in the Simmons/Tsu-Esaki model. We find
that the formation energies and SBHs are very similar for all Al(111)/Si(111)
structures, yet vary significantly for the CoSi$_2$(111)/Si(111) structures. We
attribute this to the more covalent character of bonding at CoSi$_2$/Si, which
leads to configurations with distinct atomic and electronic structure. Our
estimated Josephson critical currents, which govern the behavior of
merged-element transmons, provide insight into the trends as a function of
Schottky-barrier height. We show that desirable qubit frequencies of 4-5 GHz
can be obtained with a Si barrier thickness of about 5-10 nm, and demonstrate
that the critical current density as a function of Schottky barrier height can
be modeled based on the tunneling probability for a rectangular barrier.

<h3>Anomalous Neutron Nuclear-Magnetic Interference Spectroscopy</h3>

<p>The electron-phonon interaction plays a critical role in materials
electrical, thermal, optical, and superconducting properties. However,
measuring the phonon mode-resolved electron-phonon interaction has been
challenging. Here we propose neutron-scattering-based Anomalous Neutron
nUclear-Magnetic Interference Spectroscopy (ANUBIS), where the co-existence of
neutron nuclear scattering and magnetic scattering leads to anomalous dynamical
structure factor under the presence of the electron-phonon interaction. Such
anomalous structure factor is linear in electron-phonon coupling constant at
the phonon wavevector, and is directly proportional to the momentum and
energy-resolved dielectric function. The experimental configuration can be
achieved using existing polarized inelastic neutron scattering setup, and an
order-of-magnitude estimate shows the viability to observe the anomalous
scattering signal is around $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ relative to phonon
scattering, which is achievable at emerging neutron facilities. Our proposal
offers an alternative neutron-based metrology to probe the crucial electronic
properties.

<h3>Hybridization induced triplet superconductivity with $S^z=0$</h3>

</p><i>Edine Silva, R. C. Bento Ribeiro, Heron Caldas, Mucio A. Continentino</i>
<p>The Kitaev superconducting chain is a model of spinless fermions with
triplet-like superconductivity. It has raised interest since for some values of
its parameters it presents a non-trivial topological phase that host Majorana
fermions. The physical realization of a Kitaev chain is complicated by the
scarcity of triplet superconductivity in real physical systems. Many proposals
have been put forward to overcome this difficulty and fabricate artificial
triplet superconducting chains. In this work we study a superconducting chain
of spinful fermions forming Cooper pairs, in a triplet $S=1$ state, but with
$S^z=0$. The motivation is that such pairing can be induced in chains that
couple through an antisymmetric hybridization to an s-wave superconducting
substrate. We study the nature of edge states and the topological properties of
these chains. In the presence of a magnetic field the chain can sustain gapless
superconductivity with pairs of Fermi points. The momentum space topology of
these Fermi points is non-trivial, in the sense that they can only disappear by
annihilating each other. For small magnetic fields, we find well defined
degenerate edge modes with finite Zeemann energy. These modes are not symmetry
protected and decay abruptly in the bulk as their energy merges with the
continuum of excitations.

<p>Dislocation mobility, which dictates the response of dislocations to an
applied stress, is a fundamental property of crystalline materials that governs
the evolution of plastic deformation. Traditional approaches for deriving
mobility laws rely on phenomenological models of the underlying physics, whose
free parameters are in turn fitted to a small number of intuition-driven atomic
scale simulations under varying conditions of temperature and stress. This
tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome for
materials with complex dependencies on stress, temperature, and local
environment, such as body-centered cubic crystals (BCC) metals and alloys. In
this paper, we present a novel, uncertainty quantification-driven active
learning paradigm for learning dislocation mobility laws from automated
high-throughput large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, using Graph Neural
Networks (GNN) with a physics-informed architecture. We demonstrate that this
Physics-informed Graph Neural Network (PI-GNN) framework captures the
underlying physics more accurately compared to existing phenomenological
mobility laws in BCC metals.

<p>In this study, we investigate the electronic structure of a spin-triplet
superconductor candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$ using high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Notably,
Fermi surface nesting hints at connections to magnetic excitation or quadrupole
density wave phenomena, elucidating the superconducting mechanisms. Measured
band structures reveal primarily localized 4f electrons, with minor itinerant
contributions. Additionally, a transition from localized to itinerant behavior
and significant c-f hybridization anisotropy underscore the role of f-electrons
in shaping electronic properties. These findings deepen our understanding of
CeRh$_2$As$_2$'s unconventional superconductivity and magnetism. Further
exploration promises advances in superconductivity research.

<p>Recent reports of superconductivity in the vicinity of room temperature have
been the subject of discussion by the community. Specifically, features in the
resistance-temperature (R-T) relations have raised questions. We show that many
of these features can arise from previously unaccounted-for dynamic effects
associated with the AC transport techniques often used in high-pressure
experiments. These dynamic AC effects can can cause the apparent resistance
(Rapparent) to diverge from the DC resistance (RDC), sharpen measured
superconducting transitions, and produce other features in the measured R-T
response. We also show that utilizing the full output of phase-sensitive
transport measurements provides a valuable probe of superconducting samples in
difficult to measure systems

<p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits correlated phenomena
such as superconductivity and Mott insulating state related to the weakly
dispersing flat band near the Fermi energy. Beyond its moir\'e period, such
flat band is expected to be sensitive to lattice relaxations. Thus, clarifying
the evolution of the electronic structure with twist angle is critical for
understanding the physics of MATBG. Here, we combine nanospot angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to resolve the fine
electronic structure of the flat band and remote bands, and their evolution
with twist angles from 1.07$^\circ$ to 2.60$^\circ$. Near the magic angle,
dispersion is characterized by a flat band near the Fermi energy with a
strongly reduced bandwidth. Moreover, near 1.07$^\circ$, we observe a spectral
weight transfer between remote bands at higher binding energy and extract the
modulated interlayer spacing near the magic angle. Our work provides direct
spectroscopic information on flat band physics and highlights the role of
lattice relaxations.

</p><i>Shogo Yamashita, Akimasa Sakuma</i>
<p>We investigated the magnetic properties of Sendust (Fe-Al-Si) alloys not only
at 0 K but also at finite-temperatures by means of the first-principles
calculations assuming A2, B2, and DO3 structures. We confirmed that the
itinerant characteristics of 3d electrons of Fe are not negligible for A2 and
B2 structures and a significantly small exchange stiffness constant exists at
zero-temperature in a B2 structure. However, the calculated Curie temperatures
are in the same order for all structures; this indicates that the Curie
temperature cannot be determined only by the exchange interactions at
zero-temperature in itinerant electron systems. Temperature dependence of the
exchange interaction, namely spin configuration dependence, also might be
important for determining it. In addition, this property might also be related
to the unique behavior of the temperature dependence of the exchange stiffness
constant for the B2 structure, which does not decrease monotonically as
temperatures increase, contrary to the behavior expected from the Heisenberg
model. In addition, we investigated composition dependence on the exchange
stiffness constant at zero-temperature and confirmed that the substitution of
Si with Al could improve the amplitude of the exchange stiffness constant at
zero-temperature for all structures.

<p>Ensuring solid-state lithium batteries perform well across a wide temperature
range is crucial for their practical use. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
can provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of the battery
materials, however, the high computational cost of ab initio MD poses
challenges for simulating ion migration dynamics at low temperatures. To
address this issue, accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials were
trained, which enable efficient and reliable simulations of the ionic diffusion
processes in Li6PS5Cl over a large temperature range for long-time evolution.
Our study revealed the significant impact of subtle lattice parameter
variations on Li+ diffusion at low temperatures and identified the increasing
influence of surface contributions as the temperature decreases. Our findings
elucidate the factors influencing low temperature performance and present
strategic guidance towards improving the performance of solid-state lithium

</p><i>Xuhe Gong, Jiazi Bi, Xiaobin Liu, Ran Li, Ruijuan Xiao, Tao Zhang, Hong Li</i>
<p>The prediction of glass forming ability (GFA) and various properties in bulk
metallic glasses (BMGs) pose a challenge due to the unique disordered atomic
structure in this type of materials. Machine learning shows the potential
ability to find a way out. However, the training set from the experimental data
of BMGs faces the issue of data imbalance, including the distribution of data
related to elements, the range of performance data, and the distribution of
sparse and dense data area in each specific system. In this work, the origin of
the data imbalance and its impact on the GFA prediction ability of machine
learning models are analyzed. We propose the solutions by training the model
using the pruned dataset to mitigate the imbalance and by performing an active
experimental iterative learning to compensate for the information loss
resulting from data reduction. The strategy is proved in Zr-Al-Cu system, and
the automated workflow has been established. It effectively avoids the
prediction results from trapping into the intensive training data area or from
inducing by the data distribution of similar element systems. This approach
will expedite the development of new BMGs compositions especially for
unexplored systems.

impedance behavior of Ni-doped NASICON ceramic
Na$_{3+2x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.05--0.2) prepared
using the solid-state reaction method. The increase in dielectric constant with
temperature and decrease with frequency is explained on the basis of space
charge polarization using the two-layer model of Maxwell-Wagner relaxation. The
dielectric loss peak at lower temperatures follows the Arrhenius-type behavior
with frequency having activation energy of 0.27$\pm$0.01~eV of dipolar
relaxation, suggests similar type of defects are responsible for all the doped
samples. The real ($\epsilon$ $^{'}$) and imaginary ($\epsilon$ $^{''}$)
permittivity variation with frequency shows the broad relaxation behavior
indicates the non-Debye type of relaxation in the measured temperature range.
The permittivity values decrease with the amount of doping due to the increased
number of charge carriers upon Ni doping at the Zr site. The grain
contributions are observed at higher frequencies, while grain-boundary
contributions occur at the lower side of frequencies. The imaginary part of the
electric modulus also shows two types of relaxation peaks for all the samples
indicating similar activation energy at low temperatures and variable
activation energy at higher temperatures. The fitting of the imaginary modulus
using KWW function shows the non-Debye type of relaxation. We find that all
modulus curves merge with each other at low temperatures showing a similar type
of relaxation, while curves at high temperatures show the dispersed behavior
above the peak frequency. The {\it a.c.} conductivity data are fitted using the
double power law confirming the grain and grain boundary contributions in total
conductivity.

exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate
topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and
two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a

topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and
second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were
probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution.
The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly
visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states,
topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an
important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of

large-scale quantum-activated recurrent neural network possessing more than 3
trillion hardware nodes/cm$^2$, originating from repeatable atomic-scale
nucleation dynamics in an amorphous material integrated on-chip, controlled
with 0.07 nW electric power per readout channel. Compared to the
best-performing reservoirs currently reported, this implementation increases
the scale of the network by two orders of magnitude and reduces the power
consumption by six, reaching power efficiencies in the range of the human
brain, dissipating 0.2 nW/neuron. When interrogated by a classical input, the
chip implements a large-scale hardware security model, enabling dictionary-free
authentication secure against statistical inference attacks, including AI's
present and future development, even for an adversary with a copy of all the
classical components available. Experimental tests report 99.6% reliability,
100% user authentication accuracy, and an ideal 50% key uniqueness. Due to its
quantum nature, the chip supports a bit density per feature size area three
times higher than the best technology available, with the capacity to store
more than $2^{1104}$ keys in a footprint of 1 cm$^2$. Such a quantum-powered

<p>Structural and magnetic properties of Mn5(SixGe1-x)3 thin films were
investigated. Ferromagnetic Mn5Ge3 and anti-ferromagnetic Mn5Si3 thin films
have been synthesized and characterized as these compounds exhibit interesting
features for the development of spintronics. Here, Mn5(SixGe1-x)3 thin films
were grown on Ge(111) substrates by co-deposition using molecular beam epitaxy.
Crystalline thin films can be produced with controlled Si concentrations
ranging from 0 to 1. The thin films were relaxed by dislocations at the
interface with the substrate. A lattice parameter variation was observed as the
Si content increased, which is comparable to previous works done in bulk.
Reflection highenergy electron diffraction diagrams and X-ray diffraction
profiles showed that lattice parameters a and c are shrinking and that the
surface roughness and crystallinity degrade as the Si amount increases.
Magnetometric measurements revealed a ferromagnetic behavior for all Si
concentrations. The measured average ferromagnetic moment per manganese atom
decreased from 2.33 to 0.05 {\mu}B/Mn atom. No ferro to anti-ferromagnetic
transition was observed contrary to the bulk Mn5(SixGe1-x)3 compound.

</p><i>Ilya V. Kashin, Sergei N. Andreev</i>
<p>In this work we suggest a theoretical approach, that allows to study the
effects of magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) in metallic systems using the
Green`s functions formalism. We demonstrate that employment of the reciprocal
space resolution instead of its reduction in the inter-site variant essentially
improves the numerical stability of MCA energy by means of Monkhorst-Pack grid
density and spatial convergence. The latter problem is able to be completely
removed due to rigorous analytical replacement of pairwise atomic summation by
simple composition of sublattices contributions, calculated as a whole. The
approach is validated on the effective model of single atom, which nevertheless
inherits the qualitative MCA picture of Co monolayer and Au/Co/Au sandwiched
material. The numerical convergence is confirmed using the model of atomic
chain in the strong metallic regime. For cobalt monoxide, described by ab
initio calculations using GGA+U, the MCA energy angular profile reveals the
prevailing role of ferromagnetically aligned Co sublattices in forming of the
easy axis.

<h3>Binding zero modes with fluxons in Josephson junctions of time-reversal  invariant topological superconductors</h3>

</p><i>Gabriel F. Rodríguez Ruiz, Adrian Reich, Alexander Shnirman, Jörg Schmalian, Liliana Arrachea</i>
<p>We study the joint dynamics of the phase bias $\phi$ and the propagating
Majorana fermions of the edge modes in Josephson junctions containing 2D
time-reversal invariant topological superconductors (TRITOPS). We consider
TRITOPS-TRITOPS junctions, as well as junctions between topological and
non-topological superconductors (TRITOPS-S). Both types of junctions are
described by effective Dirac Hamiltonians with a $\phi$-dependent mass. We
analyze the effect of the phase fluctuations in the junction, as well as
solitonic solutions of $\phi$ generated by fluxons trapped in the junction. We
show that these solitons generate a spatial-dependent mass with a sign change
akin to the Jackiw-Rebbi model. This enables the formation of zero-energy
fermionic states localized at the fluxon. For the TRITOPS-TRITOPS junction
these consist of a Kramers pair of Majorana modes, while for the TRITOPS-S one,
there is a single Majorana fermion. The localized bound states hybridize in
soliton-antisoliton configurations. Depending on the occupation state, these
modes generate an effective attraction or repulsion in the dynamics of the
soliton-antisoliton collision.

<h3>Gauge Field Dynamics in a Multilayer Kitaev Spin Liquid</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Aprem P. Joy, Achim Rosch</i>
<p>The Kitaev honeycomb model hosts a quantum spin liquid in its ground state,
where the excitations are gapless Majorana fermions and static $\mathbb Z_2$
gauge fluxes called visons. We consider Kitaev models stacked on top of each
other, weakly coupled by Heisenberg interaction $\propto J_\perp$. This
inter-layer coupling breaks the integrability of the model and makes the gauge
fields dynamic. While single visons stay static in this model, an inter-layer
pair of visons can hop with a hopping amplitude $\propto J_{\perp}$, but
remains confined to a single plane. An intra-layer vison-pair, in contrast, is
constrained to move along the stacking direction only. Depending on the
anisotropy of the Kitaev couplings $K_x, K_y, K_z$, the intra-layer vison pairs
show completely different dynamical behaviours. While coherent intra-layer
tunnelling is possible for sufficiently strong anisotropies, only incoherent
processes are possible in the isotropic case. When a magnetic field opens a gap
for Majorana fermions, one can identify two types of intra-layer vison pairs,
one bosonic and one fermionic. Only the bosonic pair obtains a hopping rate
linear in $J_\perp$. We argue that our results can be used to identify leading
instabilities of the Kitaev phase induced by the inter-layer coupling.

<br>
</p><i>Sreemayee Aditya, Deepak Dhar, Diptiman Sen</i>
<p>We introduce a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions
in which a particle can hop between two neighboring sites only if the sites to
the left and right of those two sites have different particle numbers. Using a
bond to site mapping, this model involving four-site terms can be mapped to an
assisted pair-flipping model involving only three-site terms. This model shows
strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). We define irreducible strings (IS) to
label the different fragments, determine the number of fragments, and the sizes
of fragments corresponding to some special IS. In some classes of fragments,
the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized completely, and in others it can be seen to
have a structure characteristic of models which are not fully integrable. In
the largest fragment in our model, the number of states grows exponentially
with the system size, but the ratio of this number to the total Hilbert space
dimension tends to zero exponentially in the thermodynamic limit. Within this
fragment, we provide numerical evidence that only a weaker version of
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) remains valid; we call this the
subspace-restricted ETH. This is a modification of the usual ETH which combines
the strong and weak versions of ETH and is also applicable to fragments of all
dimensions. To understand the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the model, we
study the infinite-temperature time-dependent autocorrelation functions
starting from a random initial state; we find that these exhibit a different
behavior near the boundary compared to the bulk. We finally propose an
experimental setup to realize our correlated-hopping model.

<h3>Ab-initio Van der Waals electrodynamics: polaritons and electron  scattering from plasmons and phonons in BN-capped graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14322" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14322</a>
<br>
</p><i>Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri, Thibault Sohier</i>
<p>Plasmons and polar phonons are elementary electrodynamic excitations of
matter. In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the
system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van
der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from
different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their
dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not
couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to
complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons.
We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric
response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to
extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain
scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with
electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene,
in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the
nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to
graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are
identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are
studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN
layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we
find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover,
the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's
electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative
value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband
transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated
scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of
electronic transport.

<h3>Temperature dependence of micelle shape transitions in copolymer  solutions: the role of inter-block incompatibility</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14367" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14367</a>
<br>
</p><i>M. J. Greenall, M. J. Derry</i>
<p>The nature of the transition between worm-like and spherical micelles in
block copolymer dispersions varies between systems. In some formulations,
heating drives a transition from worms to spheres, while in other systems the
same transition is induced by cooling. In addition, a sphere-worm
interconversion can be accompanied either by an increase or a decrease in the
solvation of the core, even if the direction of the temperature dependence is
the same. Here, self-consistent field theory is used to provide a potential
explanation of this range of behaviour. Specifically, we show that, within this
model, the dependence of the transition on the incompatibility $\chi_{BS}$ of
the solvophobic block B and the solvent S (the parameter most closely related
to the temperature) is strongly influenced by the incompatibility $\chi_{AB}$
between B and the solvophilic block A. When $\chi_{AB}$ is small ($\chi_{AB}\le
0.1$), it is found that increasing $\chi_{BS}$ produces a transition from
worm-like micelles to spheres (or, more generally, from less curved to more
curved structures). When $\chi_{AB}$ is above 0.1, increasing $\chi_{BS}$
drives the system from spheres to worm-like micelles. Whether a transition is
observed within a realistic range of $\chi_{BS}$ is also found to depend on the
fraction of solvophilic material in the copolymer. The relevance of our
calculations to experimental results is discussed, and we suggest that the
direction of the temperature dependence may be controlled not only by the
solution behaviour of the solvophobic block (upper critical solution
temperature versus lower critical solution temperature) but also by
$\chi_{AB}$.

</p><i>Xiu-Cai Jiang, Yi-Yuan Zhao, Yu-Zhong Zhang</i>
<p>At large commensurate angles, twisted bilayer graphene which holds even
parity under sublattice exchange exhibits a tiny gap. Here, we point out a way
to tune this tiny gap into a large gap. We start from comprehensive
understanding of the physical origin of gap opening by density functional
theory calculations. We reveal that the effective inter-layer hopping,
intra-layer CDW, or inter-layer charge imbalance favors a gap. Then, on the
basis of tight-binding calculations, we suggest that a periodic transverse
inhomogeneous pressure, which can tune inter-layer hoppings in specific regions
of the moi$\rm\acute{r}$e supercell, may open a gap of over $100$~meV, which is
further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Our results provide a
theoretical guidance for experiments to open a large gap in twisted bilayer
graphene.

<p>We report on the investigation of periodic superstructures in twisted bilayer
graphene (tBLG) van-der-Waals heterostructures, where one of the graphene
layers is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Our theoretical simulations
reveal that if the ratio of the resulting two moir\'e unit cell areas is a
simple fraction, the graphene/hBN moir\'e lattice acts as a staggered
potential, breaking the degeneracy between tBLG AA sites. This leads to
additional band gaps at energies where a subset of tBLG AA sites is fully
occupied. These gaps manifest as Landau fans in magnetotransport, which we
experimentally observe in an aligned tBLG/hBN heterostructure. Our study
demonstrates the identification of commensurate tBLG/hBN van-der-Waals
heterostructures by magnetotransport, highlights the persistence of moir\'e
effects on length scales of tens of nanometers, and represents an interesting
step forward in the ongoing effort to realise designed quantum materials with

<p>A recent experimental study announced the emergence of superconductivity in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, with the highest observed superconducting
transition temperature ($T_c$) reaching approximately 80 K beyond 14 GPa. While
extensive studies have been devoted to the electronic correlations and
potential superconducting pairing mechanisms, there lack investigations into
the phonon properties and electron phonon coupling. Using density functional
theory in conjunction with Wannier interpolation techniques, we study the
phonon properties and electron phonon interactions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under
29.5 GPa. Our findings reveal that the electron phonon coupling is insufficient
to solely explain the observed high superconducting $T_c$ $\sim$ 80 K in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. And the calculated strong Fermi surface nesting may explain
the experimental observed charge density wave transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.
Our calculations substantiate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an unconventional

<p>Increasing interest in sustainable synthesis of ammonia, nitrates, and urea
has led to an increase in studies of catalytic conversion between
nitrogen-containing compounds using heterogeneous catalysts. Density functional
theory (DFT) is commonly employed to obtain molecular-scale insight into these
reactions, but there have been relatively few assessments of the
exchange-correlation functionals that are best suited for heterogeneous
catalysis of nitrogen compounds. Here, we assess a range of functionals ranging
from the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the random phase
approximation (RPA) for the formation energies of gas-phase nitrogen species,
the lattice constants of representative solids from several common classes of
catalysts (metals, oxides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)), and the
adsorption energies of a range of nitrogen-containing intermediates on these
materials. The results reveal that the choice of exchange-correlation
functional and van der Waals correction can have a surprisingly large effect
and that increasing the level of theory does not always improve the accuracy
for nitrogen-containing compounds. This suggests that the selection of
functionals should be carefully evaluated on the basis of the specific reaction
and material being studied.

<p>Recent liquid-crystalline (LC) research is focused on structurally new
molecular systems distinct from simple nematic or smectic phases. Sophisticated
molecular shape may reveal structural complexity, combining helicity and
polarity. Achiral symmetry-breaking in bent-core molecules leads to propensity
for synclinic and anticlinic molecular structures within consecutive smectic
layers. Moreover, despite their achiral character, dimers readily adopt helical
phases. In our study, we investigated a hybrid molecular structure
incorporating both characteristics, namely a rigid-bent core and an attached
bulky polar group via a flexible spacer. To perform phase identification, we
enriched the standard experimental methods with the sophisticated resonant soft
x-ray scattering. Notably, we have observed a distinct preference for specific
phase types depending on the length of the homologue. Longer homologues exhibit
a predisposition towards the formation of tilted smectic phases, characterized
by complex sequences of synclinic and anticlinic interfaces. Conversely,
shorter homologues manifest a propensity for helical smectic structures. For
intermediate homologues, the frustration is alleviated through the formation of
several modulated smectic phases. Based on the presented research, we describe
the preconditions for high level structures in relation with conflicting
constraints.

</p><i>R. F. Almada, N. A. M. Araujo, P. Patricio</i>
<p>Wounds in epithelial tissues compromise their vital role in homeostasis. A
rapid and efficient wound healing encompasses different mechanisms, which
includes the formation of a contractile actin-myosin cable around its edge,
known as the purse-string mechanism. We combine mean-field calculations and
numerical simulations of the Vertex model to study the interplay between tissue
properties and the purse-string mechanism and its impact on the healing
process. We find different regimes, where the wound opens, closes partially or
completely. We also derive an analytic expression for the closure time which is
validated by numerical simulations. This study establishes under which
conditions the purse-string mechanism suffices for closure, providing an
analytical mean-field expression for the respective thresholds.

<h3>Self-Assembled Chains and Solids of Dipolar Atoms in a Multilayer</h3>

<br>
</p><i>G. Guijarro, G. E. Astrakharchik, G. Morigi, J. Boronat</i>
<p>We predict that ultracold bosonic dipolar gases, confined within a multilayer
geometry, may undergo self-assembling processes, leading to the formation of
chain gases and solids. These dipolar chains, with dipoles aligned across
different layers, emerge at low densities and resemble phases observed in
liquid crystals, such as nematic and smectic phases. We calculate the phase
diagram using quantum Monte Carlo methods, introducing a newly devised trial
wave function designed for describing the chain gas, where dipoles from
different layers form chains without in-plane long-range order. We find gas,
solid, and chain phases, along with quantum phase transitions between these
states. Specifically, we predict a quantum phase transition from a gaseous to a
self-ordered phase, which occurs at a critical interlayer distance. Remarkably,
in the self-organized phases, the mean interparticle distance can significantly
exceed the characteristic length of the interaction potential, yielding solids
and chain gases with densities several orders of magnitude lower than those of
conventional quantum solids.

<h3>Probing Goldstino excitation through the tunneling transport in a  Bose-Fermi mixture with explicitly broken supersymmetry</h3>

</p><i>Tingyu Zhang, Yixin Guo, Hiroyuki Tajima, Haozhao Liang</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively
interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to
such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the
junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two
reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode
associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped
mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing
Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a
supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect
the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.

<p>Twisting bilayers of two-dimensional topological insulators has the potential
to create unique quantum states of matter. Here, we successfully synthesized a
twisted bilayer of germanene on Ge2Pt(101) with a 21.8$^o$ degrees twist angle,
corresponding to a commensurate ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) structure. Using
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we unraveled the structural and
electronic properties of this configuration, revealing a moir\'e-modulated band
gap and a well-defined edge state. This band gap opens at AB/BA stacked sites
and closes at AA stacked sites, a phenomenon attributed to the electric field
induced by the scanning tunneling microscopy tip. Our study further revealed
two van Hove singularities at -0.8 eV and +1.04 eV, resulting in a Fermi
velocity of $(8 \pm 1) \times 10^5$ m/s. Our tight-binding results uncover a
unique quantum state, where the topological properties could be regulated
through an electric field, potentially triggering two topological phase
transitions.

<h3>Pressure-induced enhancement of superconductivity in a  non-centrosymmetric compound LaPtGe</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14568" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14568</a>

</p><i>Sathiskumar Mariappan, Dilip Bhoi, Boby Joseph, R. P. Singh, Govindaraj Lingannan, Velaga Srihari, Arumugam Sonachalam, Yoshiya Uwatoko</i>
<p>We report a pressure-induced enhancement of the superconducting transition
temperature (Tc) in a non-centrosymmetric (NCS) compound, LaPtGe. With
pressure, till 3 GPa, we observed a modest enhancement of the Tc with a rate of
0.071 K/GPa. However, above this pressure, the rate showed a ~2.5 times
increase, 0.183 K/GPa. We observed a Tc of 3.94 K at 6 GPa, the highest
pressure value used in our transport study. Synchrotron high-pressure x-ray
powder diffraction (HP-XRPD) measurements do not reveal any structural phase
transition in this system in this pressure range. However, it showed an
apparent change of slope in the pressure dependence of lattice parameters above
and below 3 GPa. Pressure dependence of the unit-cell volume also followed a
distinct trend below and above 3 GPa, with the Birch-Murnaghan equation of
state fit providing a bulk modulus (B0) value of ~144 and ~162 GPa,
respectively, for two pressure regions. Further, the magnetotransport
measurement under pressure up to 2.45 GPa reveals the enhancement of the upper
critical field (Hc2(0)) from 0.7 T (0 GPa) to 0.92 T (2.45 GPa). In addition,
the upward curvature in Hc2(T) becomes stronger with increasing pressure,
suggesting a change of the underlying Fermi surface topology with pressure. The
signature for the inducible Hc2(T) with pressure, the distinct enhancement of
Tc around 3 GPa, and the noticeable change in lattice parameters around 3 GPa
suggests the possibility of multi-gap superconductivity in LaPtGe similar to
identical structure NCS compound, LaPtSi. The enhancement of Tc by pressure can
be correlated with the possible underlying lattice modulation by compression
and the change in the density of states at the Fermi level. Also, the bare
change in pressure-dependent activation energy U0 up to 2.45 GPa calculated
using the Arrhenius relation clearly shows that the shift in Tc does not arise
from grain boundaries.

<h3>Miscibility-Immiscibility transition of strongly interacting bosonic  mixtures in optical lattices</h3>

</p><i>Rukmani Bai, Soumik Bandyopadhyay</i>
<p>Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component
system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting
mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra
and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the
strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant.
Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects
of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this
work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of
two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square
optical lattice. Particularly we examine the transition when both the
components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF) or
supersolid (SS) phases. Our study prevails that, similar to the contact
interactions, the MIT can be influenced by competing intra and inter-component
density induced tunnelings and off-site interactions. To probe the MIT in the
strongly interacting regime, we study the extended version of the Bose-Hubbard
model with the density induced tunneling and nearest-neighbouring interaction
terms, and focus in the regime where the hopping processes are considerably
weaker than the on-site interaction. We solve this model through
site-decoupling mean-field theory with Gutzwiller ansatz and characterize the
miscibility through the site-wise co-existence of the two-component across the
lattice. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility
properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.

<h3>From Local to Emergent Altermagnetism: Footprints of Free Fermions Band  Topology</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14620" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14620</a>

</p><i>Sanjib Kumar Das, Bitan Roy</i>
<p>Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered
states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramers
non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin
nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral trilayer graphene
give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively,
thereby inheriting the free-fermion topology of linear, bi-quadratic and
bi-cubic band touchings that are also described in terms of angular momentum
$\ell=1,\; 2$ and $3$ spherical harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same
conclusions also hold inside a nematic spin-triplet superconductor, featuring
Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of
electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in real
materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets,
and showcase a novel spin-disordered alter-valleymagnet phase.
