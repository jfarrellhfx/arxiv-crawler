<h3>Continuous manipulation and characterization of colloidal beads and  liposomes via diffusiophoresis in single- and double-junction microchannels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05800</a>

We reveal an unreported physical mechanism that enables the
pre-concentration, sorting and characterization of charged polystyrene
nanobeads and liposomes dispersed in a continuous flow within a straight
micron-sized channel. Initially, a single $\Psi$-junction microfluidic chip is
used to generate a steady-state salt concentration gradient in the direction
perpendicular to the flow. As a result, fluorescent nanoparticles dispersed in
the electrolyte solutions accumulate into symmetric regions of the channel,
appearing as two distinct symmetric stripes when the channel is observed from
top via epi-fluorescence microscopy. Depending on the electrolyte flow
configuration and, thus, the direction of the salt gradient field, the
fluorescent stripes get closer to or apart from each other as the distance from
the inlet increases. Our numerical and experimental analysis shows that,
although diffusiophoresis and hydrodynamic effects are involved in the
accumulation process, diffusioosmosis plays a crucial role in the observed
particles dynamics. In addition, we developed a proof-of-concept double
$\Psi$-junction microfluidic device which exploits this new accumulation
mechanism to enable the size-based separation and detection of nanoparticle
size, zeta potential and charged lipid content under continuous flow settings.
This device is also used to investigate the effect of fluid-like or gel-like
states of the lipid membranes on the liposome diffusiophoretic response. The
proposed strategies for solute-driven manipulation of colloids have great
potential for microfluidic bio-analytical testing applications, including
bioparticle pre-concentration, sorting, sensing and analysis.

<h3>Noisy pursuit by a self-steering active particle in confinement</h3>

<br>
<br>
The properties of a cognitive, self-propelled, and self-steering particle in
the presence of a stationary target are analyzed theoretically and by
simulations. In particular, the effects of confinement in competition with
activity and steering are addressed. The pursuer is described as an intelligent
active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle (iAOUP), confined in a harmonic potential.
For the free pursuer, we find universal scaling regimes for the pursuer-target
distance in terms of the Peclet number and maneuverability. Steering results in
a novel constant mean-distance regime, which broadens with increasing
maneuverability. Confinement strongly affects the propulsion direction and
leads to a scaling at large Peclet numbers similar to that in absence of
confinement, yet with a pronounced dependence on confinement strength.

<h3>Orbital Gravito-Magnetoelectric response and Orbital magnetic quadrupole  moment correction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06047" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06047</a>

The magnetoelectric effect has been actively studied in multiferroics since
the first observation in an antiferromagnetic, $\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$. This effect
appears in systems without spatial inversion symmetry and time-reversal
symmetry and is sensitive to detecting magnetic quadrupole moments. It is often
discussed as inducing spin magnetizations; however, the orbital magnetoelectric
effect in metals has recently attracted much attention since its observation in
$\mathrm{MoS_2}$ and twisted bilayer graphene. In this work, we propose the
full quantum formalism for the temperature gradient induced-orbital
magnetoelectric effect (orbital gravito-ME effect). The effect consists of two
parts, i.e., an extrinsic part and an intrinsic part. We demonstrate that the
intrinsic part needs a correction from the orbital magnetic quadrupole moment
besides the usual Kubo formula to avoid an unphysical divergence at zero
temperature and to satisfy the Mott relation. Furthermore, we show the
classification table with the magnetic point group for the intrinsic and
extrinsic effects. Finally, we analyze the intrinsic part in a
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric model exhibiting an orbital magnetization order, i.e.,
a loop current order, and demonstrate the enhancement near Dirac points. We
believe that these results will contribute to the detection and usage of
orbital magnetic moments beyond spin moments.

<h3>Natural, Dense, and Stable Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Wurtzite Crystal  Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06111" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06111</a>

<br>
<br>
The surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) open up new opportunities for
substituting noble metals in heterogeneous catalysis. However, its applications
are severely impeded by complex construction, low surface density, and
instability. Herein, we report that SFLPs exist naturally on wurtzite crystal
(e.g., GaN, ZnO, and AlP) surfaces. Taking GaN as an example, the surface
density of SFLPs on GaN surface is up to 7.26 * 10^14 cm^-2, which nearly
quintuples the highest theoretical value on regulated metal oxide surfaces. Ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the natural SFLPs are very
stable under high temperatures and reactive atmospheres of CO and H2O.
Moreover, outstanding performance for activating important molecules is
demonstrated over these natural SFLPs, which originated from the unique orbital
orientation of SFLPs. These findings provide a simple method to obtain dense
and stable SFLPs and unfold the nature of SFLPs toward the facile activation of
small molecules.

Crystal Toolkit is an open source tool for viewing, analyzing and
transforming crystal structures, molecules and other common forms of materials
science data in an interactive way. It is intended to help beginners rapidly
develop web-based apps to explore their own data or to help developers make
their research algorithms accessible to a broader audience of scientists who
might not have any training in computer programming and who would benefit from
graphical interfaces. Crystal Toolkit comes with a library of ready-made
components that can be assembled to make complex web apps: simulation of powder
and single crystalline diffraction patterns, convex hull phase diagrams,
Pourbaix diagrams, electronic band structures, analysis of local chemical
environments and symmetry, and more. Crystal Toolkit is now powering the
Materials Project website frontend, providing user-friendly access to its
database of computed materials properties. In the future, it is hoped that new
visualizations might be prototyped using Crystal Toolkit to help explore new
forms of data being generated by the materials science community, and that this
in turn can help new materials scientists develop intuition for how their data
behaves and the insights that might be found within. Crystal Toolkit will
remain a work-in-progress and is open to contributions from the community.

<h3>Tunable electron transport in defect-engineered PdSe$_\mathrm{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Tuning the ambipolar behavior in charge carrier transport via
defect-engineering is crucial for achieving high mobility transistors for
nonlinear logic circuits. Here, we present the electric-field tunable electron
and hole transport in a microchannel device consisting of highly air-stable van
der Waals (vdW) noble metal dichalcogenide (NMDC), PdSe$_\mathrm{2}$, as an
active layer. Pristine bulk PdSe$_\mathrm{2}$ constitutes Se surface vacancy
defects created during the growth or exfoliation process and offers an
ambipolar transfer characteristics with a slight electron dominance recorded in
field-effect transistor (FET) characteristics showing an ON/OFF ratio < 10 and
electron mobility ~ 21 cm$^2$/V.s. However, transfer characteristics of
PdSe$_\mathrm{2}$ can be tuned to a hole-dominated transport while using
hydrochloric acid (HCl) as a p-type dopant. On the other hand, the chelating
agent EDTA, being a strong electron donor, enhances the electron-dominance in
PdSe$_\mathrm{2}$ channel. In addition, p-type behavior with a 100 times higher
ON/OFF ratio is obtained while cooling the sample down to 10 K. Low-temperature
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy resembles the p-type band structure
of PdSe$_\mathrm{2}$ single crystal. Also, first principle density functional
theory calculations justify the tunability observed in PdSe$_\mathrm{2}$ as a
result of defect-engineering. Such a defect-sensitive ambipolar vdW
architecture may open up new possibilities towards future CMOS (Complementary
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) device fabrications and high performance integrated
circuits.

<h3>Molecular hydrodynamic theory of the velocity autocorrelation function</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06546</a>
<br>
<i>Sean L Seyler, Charles E Seyler</i>
<br>
<br>
The velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) encapsulates extensive
information about the molecular-structural and hydrodynamic properties of a
fluid. We address the following fundamental question: How well can a purely
hydrodynamic model recover the molecular properties of a fluid as exhibited by
the VACF? To this end, we develop a bona fide hydrodynamic theory of the
tagged-particle VACF for simple fluids. Our approach is distinguished from
previous efforts in two key ways: collective hydrodynamic modes are described
by \emph{linear} hydrodynamic equations obtained as velocity moments of a
single-particle kinetic equation; the fluid's static kinetic energy spectrum is
identified as a necessary initial condition for the momentum current
correlation. This leads to a natural physical interpretation of the
molecular-hydrodynamic VACF as a superposition of quasinormal hydrodynamic
modes weighted commensurately with the static kinetic energy spectrum. Our
method yields VACF calculations quantitatively on par with existing approaches
for liquid noble gases and alkali metals; moreover, our hydrodynamic
formulation of the self-intermediate scattering function appears to extend the
description to low densities where the Schmidt number is of order unity,
enabling calculations for the vapor and supercritical phases.

<h3>Superconducting diode effect in topological hybrid structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06575" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06575</a>
<br>
<i>Tairzhan Karabassov, Emir S. Amirov, Irina V. Bobkova, Alexander A. Golubov, Elena A. Kazakova, Andrey S. Vasenko</i>
<br>
<br>
Currently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE) is actively discussed due
to large application potential in superconducting electronics. In particular,
the superconducting hybrid structures based on three-dimensional (3D)
topological insulators are among the best candidates due to the strongest
spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Most of the theoretical studies of the SDE focus
either on full numerical calculation, which is often rather complicated or on
the phenomenological approach. In the present paper we perform a comparison of
the linearized and nonlinear microscopic approaches in the superconductor/
ferromagnet/ 3D topological insulator (S/F/TI) hybrid structure. Employing the
quasiclassical Green's function formalism we solve the problem
self-consistently. We show that the results obtained by the linearized
approximation are not qualitatively different from the nonlinear solution. Main
distinction in the results between the two methods is quantitative, i. e. they
yield different supercurrent amplitudes. However, when calculating the
so-called diode quality factor the quantitative difference is eliminated and
both approaches can result in a good agreement.

<h3>Post-Experiment Forensics and Human-in-the-Loop Interventions in  Explainable Autonomous Scanning Probe Microscopy</h3>

The broad adoption of machine learning (ML)-based automated and autonomous
experiments (AE) in physical characterization and synthesis requires
development of strategies for understanding and intervention in the
experimental workflow. Here, we introduce and realize strategies for
post-acquisition forensic analysis applied to the deep kernel learning based AE
scanning probe microscopy. This approach yields real-time and post-acquisition
indicators of the progression of an active learning process interacting with an
experimental system. We further illustrate that this approach can be extended
towards human-in-the-loop autonomous experiments, where human operators make
high-level decisions at high latencies setting the policies for AE, and the ML
algorithm performs low-level fast decisions. The proposed approach is universal
and can be extended to other physical and chemical imaging techniques and
applications such as combinatorial library analysis. The full forensic analysis
notebook is publicly available on GitHub at

<h3>Uncovering the Structural Evolution Arsenene on SiC Substrate</h3>

Two-dimensional arsenic allotropes have been grown on metallic surfaces,
while topological properties have been theoretically described on strained
structures. Here we experimentally grow arsenene by molecular beam epitaxy over
the insulating SiC substrate. The arsenene presents a flat structure with a
strain field that follows the SiC surface periodicity. Our ab initio
simulations, based on the density functional theory, corroborate the
experimental observation. The strained structure presents a new arsenene
allotrope with a triangular structure, rather than the honeycomb previously
predicted for other pnictogens. This strained structure presents a Peierls-like
transition leading to an indirect gap semiconducting behavior.

<h3>Thermodynamic limit of the free electron gas on a circle</h3>

We show that for the ground state of a one dimensional free electron gas on a
circle the analytic expression for the canonical ensemble partition function
can be easily derived from the density matrix by assuming that the
thermodynamic limit coincides with the limit of the eigenfunction expansion of
the kinetic energy. This approximation fails to give the finite temperature
partition function because those two limits cannot be chosen as coincident.

<h3>Cryogenic nano-imaging of second-order moiré superlattices</h3>

<br>
Second-order superlattices form when moir\'e superlattices of similar
dimensions interfere with each other, leading to even larger superlattice
periodicities. These crystalline structures have been engineered utilizing
two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) under specific alignment conditions. Such specific alignment has shown to
play a crucial role in facilitating correlation-driven topological phases
featuring the quantized anomalous Hall effect. While signatures of second-order
superlattices have been found in transport experiments, any real-space
visualization is lacking to date. In this work, we present cryogenic nanoscale
photovoltage (PV) measurements that reveal a second-order superlattice in
magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) closely aligned to hBN. This is
evidenced by long-range periodic photovoltage modulations across the entire
sample backed by corresponding electronic transport features. Our theoretical
framework shows that small strain- or twist-angle variations can lead to a
drastic shift between a local one-dimensional, square or triangular
superlattices. Our real-space observations shed new light on the mechanisms
responsible for breaking spatial symmetries in TBG and pave an avenue to
engineer long-range superlattice structures in 2D materials.

Magnetic noise of atomic nuclear spins is a major problem for solid state
spin qubits. Highly-polarized nuclei would not only overcome this obstacle, but
also make nuclear spins a useful quantum information resource. However,
achieving sufficiently high nuclear polarizations has remained an evasive goal.
Here we implement a nuclear spin polarization protocol which combines strong
optical pumping and fast electron tunneling. Polarizations well above 95% are
generated in GaAs semiconductor quantum dots on a timescale of 1 minute. The
technique is compatible with standard quantum dot device designs, where
highly-polarized nuclear spins can simplify implementations of quantum bits and
memories, as well as offer a testbed for studies of many-body quantum dynamics
and magnetism.

<h3>Cryogenic Characteristics of Graphene Composites -- Evolution from  Thermal Conductors to Thermal Insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
The development of cryogenic semiconductor electronics and superconducting
quantum computing requires composite materials that can provide both thermal
conduction and thermal insulation. We demonstrated that at cryogenic
temperatures, the thermal conductivity of graphene composites can be both
higher and lower than that of the reference pristine epoxy, depending on the
graphene filler loading and temperature. There exists a well-defined cross-over
temperature - above it, the thermal conductivity of composites increases with
the addition of graphene; below it, the thermal conductivity decreases with the
addition of graphene. The counter-intuitive trend was explained by the
specificity of heat conduction at low temperatures: graphene fillers can serve
as, both, the scattering centers for phonons in the matrix material and as the
conduits of heat. We offer a physical model that explains the experimental
trends by the increasing effect of the thermal boundary resistance at cryogenic
temperatures and the anomalous thermal percolation threshold, which becomes
temperature dependent. The obtained results suggest the possibility of using
graphene composites for, both, removing the heat and thermally insulating
components at cryogenic temperatures - a capability important for quantum
computing and cryogenically cooled conventional electronics.

<h3>Searching for unconventional superfluid in exciton condensate of  monolayer semiconductors</h3>

It is well known that two-dimensional (2D) bosons in homogeneous space cannot
undergo real Bose-Einstein condensation, and the superfluid to normal phase
transition is Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type, associated with
vortex-antivortex pair unbinding. Here we point out a 2D bosonic system whose
low energy physics goes beyond conventional paradigm of 2D homogeneous bosons,
i.e., intralayer excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. With
intrinsic valley-orbit coupling and external magnetic field, exciton dispersion
becomes linear at small momentum, giving rise to a series of novel features.
The critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of these excitons is
nonzero, suggesting true long-range order in 2D homogeneous system. The
dispersion of Goldstone mode at long wavelength has the form
$\varepsilon(\boldsymbol{q})\sim\sqrt{q}$, in contrast to conventional linear
phonon spectrum. The vortex energy deviates from the usual logarithmic form
with respect to system size, but instead has an additional linear term.
Superfluid to normal phase transition is no longer BKT type for system size
beyond a characteristic scale, without discontinuous jump in superfluid
density. With the recent experimental progress towards realization of exciton
condensate in monolayer semiconductors, our work provides an experimentally
feasible system to search for unconventional 2D superfluids beyond BKT
paradigm.

<br>
<br>
The magnetic structure, magnetoresistance, and Hall effect of
non-centrosymmetric magnetic semimetal NdAlGe are investigated revealing an
unusual magnetic state and anomalous transport properties that are associated
with the electronic structure of this non-centrosymmetric compound. The
magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements are both highly anisotropic
and indicate an Ising-like magnetic system. The magnetic structure is complex
in that it involves three magnetic ordering vectors including an incommensurate
spin density wave and commensurate ferrimagnetic state in zero field. We have
discovered a large anomalous Hall conductivity that reaches = 430
{\Omega}-1cm-1 implying that it originates from an intrinsic Berry curvature
effect stemming from Weyl nodes found in the electronic structure. These
electronic structure calculations indicate the presence of nested Fermi surface
pockets with nesting wave vectors similar to the measured magnetic ordering
wavevector and the presence of Weyl nodes in proximity to the Fermi surface. We
associate the incommensurate magnetic structure with the large anomalous Hall
response to be the result of the combination of Fermi surface nesting and the
Berry curvature associated with Weyl nodes.

Higher-order topological states (HOTS) have been extensively investigated in
classical wave systems. They do not exist in the band gaps of infinite
materials, while exhibit as the in-gap localized modes once the infinite
materials are truncated to be the finite structures. Here, we will
experimentally reveal the origin of HOTSs in acoustic systems. We design the
hollow acoustic structures exclusively composed of hinge and corner resonators.
We present the experimental proof that, despite the lack of surfaces and bulks,
the hollow acoustic structures can still support the topologically protected
hinge and corner states, indicating that the local configurations of boundaries
are the sources for the generation of HOTSs. We then get the composite
structures by assembling the 2D and 3D topological hollow acoustic structures,
and experimentally observe the robust HOTSs in them. Our results provide a
fundamental perspective on HOTSs in periodic structures, and we foresee that
these findings will pave the way toward designing new topological devices for
energy recovering, information processing, non-destructive testing and acoustic
sensing.

<h3>Evidence for three-dimensional Dirac semimetal state in strongly  correlated organic quasi-two-dimensional material</h3>

<br>
<br>
The three-dimensional Dirac semimetal is distinct from its two-dimensional
counterpart due to its dimensionality and symmetry. Here, we observe that
molecule-based quasi-two-dimensional Dirac fermion system,
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$, exhibits chiral anomaly-induced negative
magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect upon entering the coherent inter-layer
tunneling regime under high pressure. Time-reversal symmetry is broken due to
the strong electronic correlation effect, while the spin-orbit coupling effect
is negligible. The system provides an ideal platform for investigating the
chiral anomaly physics by controlling dimensionality and strong electronic
correlation.

<h3>Room Temperature d$^0$ Ferromagnetism in Carbon Doped LaH$_3$: Insights  From Density Functional Theory Simulations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Employing the state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory with both GGA and
hybrid HSE06 functional along with the incorporation of spin-orbit coupling, we
have engineered stable room temperature ferromagnetism in non-magnetic LaH$_3$
through C substitution at octahedral and tetrahedral H sites where the induced
magnetic moment is mostly contributed by 2p orbital of C atom. It is
interesting that the magnetic signature is switched on with an impurity
concentration as low as 1.04 at% with a magnetic moment of $\approx$ 1.0
$\mu_B$ per impurity, where the localized behavior of the 2p states of C along
with significant exchange splitting energy can be attributed as the origin of
the induced magnetic moment. The verification of the Stoner criterion in the
material further confirmed the onset of ferromagnetism in the system, and the
computed Curie temperature is found to be well above room temperature. Reduced
formation energy and requirement of lower impurity concentration ensure
practical feasibility towards a spintronic device where room temperature
ferromagnetism is established from the non-magnetic host and the dopant.

<h3>First-Principles Calculation of the Optical Rotatory Power of Periodic  Systems: Modern Theory with Modern Functionals</h3>

An analysis of orbital magnetization in band insulators is provided. It is
shown that a previously proposed electronic orbital angular-momentum operator
generalizes the ``modern theory of orbital magnetization'' to include non-local
Hamiltonians. Expressions for magnetic transition dipole moments needed for the
calculation of optical rotation (OR) and other properties are developed. A
variety of issues that arise in this context are critically analyzed. These
issues include periodicity of the operators, previously proposed band
dispersion terms as well as, if and where needed, evaluation of reciprocal
space derivatives of orbital coefficients. Our treatment is used to determine
the optical rotatory power of band insulators employing a formulation that
accounts for electric dipole - electric quadrupole (DQ), as well as electric
dipole-magnetic dipole, contributions. An implementation in the public
\textsc{Crystal} program is validated against a model finite system and applied
to the $\alpha$-quartz mineral through linear-response time-dependent density
functional theory with a hybrid functional. The latter calculations confirmed
the importance of DQ terms. Agreement against experiment was only possible with
i) use of a high quality basis set, ii) inclusion of a fraction of non-local
Fock exchange, and iii) account of orbital-relaxation terms in the calculation
of response functions.

We consider a statistical mechanics of a rotating ideal gas of classical
relativistic particles with nonzero mass and spin. Applying the Gibbs theory of
canonical ensembles for a system rotating with constant angular velocity, we
obtain the one-particle distribution function by positions, momenta, and spins.
The model demonstrates the polarization of spinning degree of freedom by
rotation, with the majority of spins being directed along the angular velocity
vector. The rotation polarizability of the gas is explicitly found as the
function of temperature and position with respect to the rotation axis. The
results of the article demonstrate that the classical theory of spin is a
useful tool for study of chiral effects in rotating gases.

Feshbach resonances of arbitrary width are typically described in terms of
two-channel models. Within these models, one usually considers a single dressed
resonance, with the option to extend the analysis by including resonant
open-channel features that can drastically change the observed threshold
effects. For the strong $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ p-wave resonance studied in Ref.
\cite{ahmed2021}, the interplay between an open-channel shape resonance and the
Feshbach resonance could explain the unexpected nonlinear variation of the
binding energy with magnetic field. However, the presented two-channel
treatment relies on the introduction of two independent fitting parameters,
whereas the typical Breit-Wigner expression would only account for one. This
results in an effective magnetic moment that acquires a nonphysical value,
which is an indication of a major shortcoming of the two-channel model
treatment. In this study, we observe how the presence of a closed-channel shape
resonance explains the physical mechanism behind the observations and
demonstrates the need of a three-channel treatment. We introduce our novel
model as \textit{resonance facilitated}, where all coupling is mediated by the
Feshbach state, while there is no direct coupling between the additional
channel and the open channel. Notably, the resonance-facilitated structure
greatly reduces the complexity of the full three-channel model. The typical
Breit-Wigner form of the two-channel Feshbach formalism is retained and the
full effect of the added channel can be captured by a single resonance dressing
factor, which describes how the free propagation in the Feshbach state is
dressed by the added channel.

<h3>Low-energy scatterings and pseudopotential of polarized quadrupoles</h3>

We investigate the low-energy scattering properties of two identical
particles interacting via the polarized quadrupolar interaction. It is shown
that a series of $s$- and $p$-wave resonances appear for identical bosons and
fermions, respectively, as the strength of the quadrupolar interaction
increases. Interestingly, scattering resonances also appear on the generalized
scattering length corresponding to the coupling between the $s$ and $d$ waves.
This observation inspires us to propose a new pseudopotential for the
quadupolar interaction. We also explore the bound-state properties of two
particles in both free space and harmonic traps.

Realization of high-quality van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with
tailored properties by stacking two-dimensional (2D) layers requires atomically
clean interfaces. Because of strong adhesion between the constituent layers,
the vdW forces could drive trapped contaminants together into submicron-size
bubbles, which leaves large interfacial areas atomically clean. Such a
phenomenon is dubbed self-cleaning mechanism in 2D systems. Here, we
demonstrate the breakdown of self-cleaning mechanism for nanoscale interfacial
bubbles in tiny-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). In the tiny-angle TBG,
there is a triangular network of domain boundaries due to structural
reconstruction. Our experiments indicate that the bubbles will mainly move
along the triangular network of domain boundaries when the sizes of the bubbles
are comparable to that of an AA-stacking region in the TBG. When the size of
the bubble is smaller than that of an AA-stacking region, the bubble becomes
motionless and is fixed in the AA-stacking region because of its large
out-of-plane corrugation. Our results reveal a substantial influence of the
moir\'e superlattice on the motion of nanoscale interfacial substances.

<h3>Improvement in the Performance and Efficiency on Self-Deficient  CaTiO$_3$: Towards Sustainable and Affordable New-Generation Solar Cells</h3>

Thin films of pure and self-deficient calcium titanites i.e., CaTiO$_3$,
Ca$_{1-\alpha}$TiO$_3$, CaTi$_{1-\beta}$O$_3$ and CaTiO$_{3-\gamma}$ have been
deposited on ITO substrate using dip coating method. X-ray diffraction and
Scanning electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis confirm the structural and
morphology of all deposited thin films. Photocurrent measurement has been done,
and it is observed that during the incidence of UV light on the as-prepared
device (i.e., in the "ON" state), a significant increase in photocurrent (IUV)
at zero voltage was observed in case of O deficient CaTiO$_3$, while in case of
Ti and Ca deficient thin films smaller values of photocurrents were seen.
Responsivity and detectivity of deposited thin films of all self-deficient
CaTiO3 were found to be maximum in the UV region while they also showed smaller
contributions in the visible range possibly due to the presence of
self-deficiency. The self-deficient sample exhibits lower resistance (higher
recombination rate) than the pure sample at low voltage, but at higher voltage,
it is almost identical. Furthermore, theoretical calculations have been
performed using the first-principles density-functional theory to validate the
experimental findings on self-deficient CaTiO$_3$. Incident-photon-to-current
efficiency (IPCE) and current density have also been measured for all deficient
CaTiO$_3$ samples. Maximum IPCE have been found in the range 25%-28% for Ti and
O deficient samples in the UV range (280- 400 nm). We argue that
first-principles DFT calculations combined with the experimental measurements
on self-deficient CaTiO$_3$ thin films offer a reliable way to enhance the
performance of perovskite-based solar devices.

Quantum gas systems provide a unique experimental platform to study a
fundamental paradigm of quantum many-body physics: the crossover between
Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) molecular pairs and Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer
(BCS) superfluidity. Some studies have considered quantum gas samples confined
in optical lattices, however, focusing on the case, when only the lowest Bloch
band is populated, such that orbital degrees of freedom are excluded. In this
work, for the first time, ultracold Feshbach molecules of fermionic $^{40}K$
atoms are selectively prepared in the second Bloch band of an optical square
lattice, covering a wide range of interaction strengths including the regime of
unitarity. Binding energies and band relaxation dynamics are measured by means
of a method resembling mass spectrometry. The longest lifetimes arise for
strongly interacting Feshbach molecules at the onset of unitarity with values
around 300 ms for the lowest band and 100 ms for the second band. In the case
of strong confinement in a deep lattice potential, we observe bound dimers also
for negative values of the s-wave scattering length, extending previous
findings for molecules in the lowest band. Our work prepares the stage for
orbital BEC-BCS crossover physics.

The diffusion of iodine defects has been considered the most important
degradation mechanism of methylammonium lead iodine (MAPI) in solar cells. The
present study demonstrates the importance of the pressure inside this material
on the dynamics of iodine defects, using molecular dynamics simulations. It is
known that the diffusion coefficient of an iodine vacancy is an order of
magnitude higher than that of interstitial iodine. We show that this difference
systematically increases with increased tensile strain and that both diffusion
coefficients tend to zero when a compressive strain is applied. This result
suggests that compression of the MAPI can be a good solution to reduce its
degradation rate. %Also, different methods of determining the diffusion
coefficient, including mean squared displacement (MSD) and velocity
auto-correlation function, are discussed and applied to the case of ${\rm
V}_{\rm I}$. Besides, the statistical aspect of deriving the diffusion
coefficient from the mean squared displacement (MSD) is discussed in terms of
the initial conditions (positions and velocities) of the atoms and the
simulation time, considering different seeds of the pseudo-random number
generator used in the simulations performed with the LAMMPS software.

<h3>Role of the single-particle dynamics in the transverse current  autocorrelation function of a liquid metal</h3>

A very recent simulation study of the transverse current autocorrelation of
the Lennard-Jones fluid revealed, as expected, that this function can be
perfectly described within the exponential expansion theory. However, above a
certain wavevector $Q$, not only transverse collective excitations are found to
propagate in the fluid, but a second oscillatory component of unclear origin
(thereby called X) must be considered to properly account for the time behavior
of the correlation. Here we present an extended investigation of the transverse
current autocorrelation of liquid Au as obtained by ab initio molecular
dynamics in the very wide range 5.7 nm$^{-1}$ $\le Q \le$ 32.8 nm$^{-1}$ in
order to follow the behavior of the X component, if present, also at large $Q$
values. By combining the study of the transverse current autocorrelation with
the analogous analysis of its self part, we show that the second oscillatory
component originates from the longitudinal dynamics and appears in the same
form as a collective excitation is represented in the single-particle behavior.
Therefore, the signature of the longitudinal processes (sound waves) in the
transverse current autocorrelation is not due to often conjectured couplings of
longitudinal and trasverse modes, but descends from the self part of the
function, which contains the traces of all processes acting in the fluid as the
density of states, that is the spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation
function, does.

We review some recent results on entanglement in the Quantum Spherical Model
(QSM). The focus lays on the physical results rather than the mathematical
details. Specifically, we study several entanglement-related quantities, such
asentanglement entropies, and logarithmic negativity, in the presence of
quantum and classical critical points, and in magnetically ordered phases. We
consider both the short as well as the long-range QSM. The study of
entanglement properties of the QSM is feasible because the model is mappable to
a Gaussian system in any dimension. Despite this fact the QSM is an ideal
theoretical laboratory to investigate a wide variety of physical scenarios,
such as non mean field criticality, the effect of long-range interactions, the
interplay between finite-temperature fluctuations and genuine quantum ones.

<h3>Controllable quantum scars induced by spin-orbit couplings in quantum  dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) which are the relativistic corrections
originated from the Dirac equation, offer nonlinearity in the classical limit
and are capable of driving the chaotic dynamics. In a quantum dot confined by a
two dimensional parabolic potential with SOCs, various quantum scar states
emerge quasi-periodically in the eigenstates of the system, when the ratio of
the confinement energies in the two directions are nearly commensurable. The
scars, displaying both the quantum interference and the classical trajectory on
the electron density, induced by the relativistic effects, indicate the bridge
between the classical and quantum behaviors of the system. When the strengths
of the Rashba and Dresselhaus SOCs are identical, the chaos is eliminated as
the classical Hamilton's equations being linear and all the quantum scar states
disappear consequently. The quantum scars induced by SOCs are found to be
robust against small perturbations of the systematic parameters. As the Rashba
SOC been controlled precisely by an external gate in experiments, the quantum
scar here is fully predictable, controllable and accessible to detection.

Selecting suitable charge transport layers and suppressing non-radiative

efficiency of halide perovskite solar cells. In this work, high-quality
perovskite thin films and devices are fabricated with different fullerene-based
electron transport layers and different self-assembled monolayers as hole
transport layers. We then perform a comparative study of a significant variety
of different electrical, optical and photoemission-based characterization
techniques to quantify the properties of the solar cells, the individual layers
and importantly the interfaces between them. In addition, we highlight the
limitations and problems of the different measurements, the insights gained by
combining different methods and the different strategies to extract information
from the experimental raw data.

Closed cycle $He^{3}-He^{4}$ dilution cryostats became the platform of choice

<h3>Spatial magnetization profile in spherical nanomagnets with surface  anisotropy: Green's function approach</h3>

We consider a single spherical nanomagnet and investigate the spatial
magnetization profile $\mathbf{m}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)$ in the continuum
approach, using the Green's function formalism. The energy of the (many-spin)
nanomagnet comprises an isotropic exchange interaction, a uniaxial anisotropy
in the core and N\'eel's surface anisotropy, and an external magnetic field. We
derive a semi-analytical expression for the magnetization vector field
$\mathbf{m}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)$ for an arbitrary position $\mathbf{r}$
within and on the boundary of the nanomagnet, as a solution of a homogeneous
Helmholtz equation with inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
...
For a more plausible comparison with experiments, \emph{e.g.} using the
technique of small-angle magnetic neutron scattering, we have averaged over the
direction solid angle and derived the spatial profile in terms of the distance
$r$. We believe that the predictions of the present study could help to
characterize and understand the effects of size and surface anisotropy on the
magnetization configurations in nanomagnet assemblies such as arrays of
well-spaced platelets.

Certain fractional quantum Hall edges have been predicted to undergo quantum
phase transitions which reduce the number of edge channels and at the same time
bind electrons together. However, detailed studies of experimental signatures
of such a ``binding transition'' remain lacking. Here, we propose quantum
transport signatures with focus on the edge at filling $\nu=9/5$. We
demonstrate theoretically that in the regime of non-equilibrated edge
transport, the bound and unbound edge phases have distinct conductance and
noise characteristics. We also show that for a quantum point contact in the
strong back-scattering regime, the bound phase produces a minimum Fano-factor
$F_{SBS}=3$ corresponding to three-electron tunneling, whereas single electron
tunneling is strongly suppressed at low energies. Together with recent
experimental developments, our results will be useful for detecting binding
transitions in the fractional quantum Hall regime.

<br>

As amorphous materials get jammed, both geometric and dynamic heterogeneity
are observed. We investigate the correlation between the local geometric
heterogeneity and local rearrangements in a slowly compressed bidisperse
quasi-two-dimensional emulsion system. The compression is driven by evaporation
of the continuous phase, and causes the area packing fraction to increase from
0.88 to 0.99. We quantify the structural heterogeneity of the system using the
radical Voronoi tessellation following the method of [Rieser et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 116, 088001 (2016)]. We define two structural quantities characterizing
local structure, the first which considers nearest neighbors and the second of
which includes information from second nearest neighbors. We find that droplets
in heterogeneous local regions are more likely to have local rearrangements.
These rearrangements are generally T1 events where two droplets converge toward
a void, and two droplets move away from the void to make room for the
converging droplets. Thus the presence of the voids tends to orient the T1
events. The presence of a correlation between the structural quantities and the
rearrangement dynamics remains qualitatively unchanged over the entire range of
packing fractions observed.

<h3>Universal preference for low energy core-shifted grain boundaries at the  surfaces of fcc metals</h3>

Grain boundaries with [111] tilt axes are common in polycrystalline face
centered cubic metals. For copper (111) films, emergent grain boundaries close
to surface have tilt axes that are shifted away from [111] that are lower in
energy than the corresponding truncated bulk boundaries. Geometrical analysis
and atomic calculations were used to study the driving force for this same
relaxation phenomenon in representative fcc elemental metals. We show that the
reduction in boundary energy scales with the elimination of energetically
costly boundary core facets. We find that for a wide range of misorientation
angles low energy core-shifted boundaries are also favored in Al, Ni, Au and Pt
and discuss the significance for electromigration and other metal properties.

<h3>Core shift controls grain boundary energy scaling in Cu and Al</h3>

<i>Xiaopu Zhang, John J. Boland</i>
<br>
<br>
Grain boundary energies in different elements are correlated. The
proportional scaling constants relating the energies of
crystallography-equivalent boundaries in any two f.c.c. elements are nearly
constant, with the notable exception of aluminum where these constants are
known to vary significantly. However, the origins of the exceptional behavior
of aluminum are not understood. Previously, we reported that for fcc metals
there is a preference for boundaries to shift their tilt axis across the (1-10)
plane towards [112] and to ultimately form low energy [112] core shifted
boundaries (CSBs). By comparing grain boundary energies in copper and aluminum
with different tilt axis in (1-10) plane, we now report the existence of a
well-defined scaling behavior for the case of low angle boundaries. In
contrast, the scaling constant for high angle boundaries is essentially fixed
regardless of their tilt axis shift. This results in a gradual change in the
scaling constants from low angle to high angle boundaries, which is responsible
for the apparent exceptional scaling behavior found in aluminum. An analysis of
structure evolution during core shifting points to the significance of
boundary-core dissociation, a form of correlated relaxation of individual atoms
at boundaries, in controlling the scaling of the boundary energies.

Topological edge states are the core of topological photonics. Here we
introduce the antihelical edge states of time-reversal symmetric topological
metals and propose a photonic realization in an anisotropic square lattice of
coupled ring resonators, where the clockwise and counterclockwise modes play
the role of pseudospins. The antihelical edge states robustly propagate across
the corners toward the diagonal of the square lattice: The same (opposite)
pseudospins copropagate in the same (opposite) direction on the parallel
lattice boundaries; the different pseudospins separate and converge at the
opposite corners. The antihelical edge states in the topological metallic phase
alter to the helical edge states in the topological insulating phase under a
metal-insulator phase transition. The antihelical edge states provide a unique
manner of topologically-protected robust light transport applicable for
topological purification. Our findings create new opportunities for topological
photonics and metamaterials.

We perform a frequency-resolved analysis of electron dynamics in solids to
obtain microscopic insight into linear and nonlinear optical phenomena. For the
analysis, we first compute the electron dynamics under optical electric fields
and evaluate the microscopic current density as a function of time and space.
Subsequently, we perform the Fourier transformation on the microscopic current
density and obtain the corresponding quantity in the frequency domain. The
frequency-resolved microscopic current density provides insight into the
microscopic electron dynamics in real-space at the frequency of linear and
nonlinear optical responses. We apply frequency-resolved microscopic current
density analysis to light-induced electron dynamics in aluminum, silicon, and
diamond based on the first-principles electron dynamics simulation according to
the time-dependent density functional theory. Consequently, the nature of
delocalized electrons in metals and bound electrons in semiconductors and
insulators is suitably captured by the developed scheme.

The paper considers the behaviour of the number of paths of length $N$ on

It is found that localisation is observed with the same ratio of vertex degrees

In our understanding of solids, the formation of highly spatially coherent
electronic states, fundamental to command the quantum behavior of materials,
relies on the existence of discrete translational symmetry of the crystalline
lattice. In contrast, in the absence of long-range order, as in the case of
non-crystalline materials, the electronic states are localized and electronic
coherence does not develop. This brings forward the fundamental question
whether long range order is necessary condition to establish coherence and
structured momentum-dependent electronic state, and how to characterize it in
the presence of short-range order. Here we study Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a material that
exists in its crystalline form with long range order, in amorphous form, with
short and medium range order, and in its nanocrystalline form, with reduced
short range order. By using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to
directly access the electronic states in a momentum resolved manner, we reveal
that, even in the absence of long-range order, a well-defined real-space length
scale is sufficient to produce dispersive band structures. Moreover, we observe
for the first time a repeated Fermi surface structure of duplicated annuli,
reminiscent of Brillouin zone-like repetitions. These results, together with
our simulations using amorphous Hamiltonians, reveal that the typical momentum
scale where coherence occurs is the inverse average nearest-neighbor distance,
the direct fingerprint of the local order of the underlying atomic structure.
These results, not only lead the way to a new understanding of electronic
coherence in solids, but also open the way to the realization of novel
momentum-dependent quantum phenomena such as momentum pairing and spin-orbit
coupling, in a much broader class of materials than the currently studied ones,
lacking long range crystalline translational symmetry.

Scale-free phase-field approach (PFA) at large strains and corresponding
finite element method (FEM) simulations for multivariant martensitic phase
transformation (PT) from cubic Si I to tetragonal Si II in a polycrystalline
aggregate are presented. Important features of the model are large and very
anisotropic transformation strain tensor $\varepsilon_{t}=\{0.1753;0.1753;
-0.447\}$ and stress-tensor dependent athermal dissipative threshold for PT,
which produce essential challenges for computations. 3D polycrystals with 55
and 910 stochastically oriented grains are subjected to uniaxial strain- and
stress-controlled loadings under periodic boundary conditions and zero averaged
lateral strains. Coupled evolution of discrete martensitic microstructure,
volume fractions of martensitic variants and Si II, stress and transformation
strain tensors, and texture are presented and analyzed. Macroscopic variables
effectively representing multivariant transformational behavior are introduced.
Macroscopic stress-strain and transformational behavior for 55 and 910 grains
are close (less than 10% difference). This allows the determination of
macroscopic constitutive equations by treating aggregate with a small number of
grains. Large transformation strains and grain boundaries lead to huge internal
stresses of tens GPa, which affect microstructure evolution and macroscopic
behavior. In contrast to a single crystal, the local mechanical instabilities
due to PT and negative local tangent modulus are stabilized at the macroscale
by arresting/slowing the growth of Si II regions by the grain boundaries and
generating the internal back stresses. This leads to increasing stress during
PT. The developed methodology can be used for studying similar PTs with large
transformation strains and for further development by including plastic strain
and strain-induced PTs.

<h3>Ginzburg-Landau approximation for the Hubbard model in the external  magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Hubbard model is studied in the external magnetic field. The analysis is
carried out phenomenologically within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau
theory with the order parameter describing the opposite spin electrons. The
study is performed for the nearly half-filled lower Hubbard band in the
metallic state. The final equations are the Pauli-like ones for the opposite
spins and nonlinear as a result of interaction between electrons with the
opposite spins. The equations can analytically be solved for the spatially
homogeneous distributions in a number of most interesting cases. In particular,
the problem on the metal-insulator transition is analyzed for the nearly
half-filled Hubbard sub-bands. The critical magnetic field at which the
transition from the metallic state to the insulator one takes place is found
under the paramagnetic spin effect.

The distinction between chiral, trivial helical, and topological helical edge
modes can be effectively made using quantum noise measurements at finite
temperatures. The use of quantum noise, both the cross (or the Hanbury-Brown
Twiss) correlation and the autocorrelation can differentiate between these edge
modes via the two contributions: thermal-like noise from thermal fluctuations
and shot noise from the quantum nature of charge particles. The study of these
edge modes at finite temperatures is important as it more accurately reflects
the conditions in real-world experiments.

<h3>Solid-amorphous transition is related to the waterlike anomalies in a  fluid without liquid-liquid phase transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05999" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05999</a>
<br>
<i>José Rafael Bordin, Leandro B. Krott</i>
<br>
<br>
The most accepted origin for the water anomalous behavior is the phase
transition between two liquids (LLPT) in the supercooled regime connected to
the glassy first order phase transition at lower temperatures. Two length
scales potentials are an effective approach that have long being employed to
understand the properties of fluids with waterlike anomalies and, more
recently, the behavior of colloids and nanoparticles. These potentials can be
parameterized to have distinct shapes, as a pure repulsive ramp, such as the
model proposed by de Oliveira et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 124, 64901 (2006)]. This
model has waterlike anomalies despite the absence of LLPT. To unravel how the
waterlike anomalies are connected to the solid phases we employ Molecular
Dynamics simulations. We have analyzed the fluid-solid transition under
cooling, with two solid crystalline phases, BCC and HCP, and two amorphous
regions being observed. We show how the competition between the scales creates
an amorphous cluster in the BCC crystal that leads to the amorphization at low
temperatures. A similar mechanism is found in the fluid phase, with the system
changing from a BCC-like to an amorphous-like structure in the point where a
maxima in $k_T$ is observed. With this, we can relate the competition between
two fluid structures with the amorphous clusterization in the BCC phase.Those
findings help to understand the origins of waterlike behavior in systems
without liquid-liquid critical point.

<br>
<br>
By controlling in real-time the variance of the radiation pressure exerted on
an optically trapped microsphere, we engineer temperature protocols that
shortcut thermal relaxation when transferring the microsphere from one thermal
equilibrium state to an other. We identify the entropic footprint of such
accelerated transfers and derive optimal temperature protocols that either
minimize the production of entropy for a given transfer duration or accelerate
as much as possible the transfer for a given entropic cost. Optimizing the
trade-off yields time-entropy bounds that put speed limits on thermalization
schemes. We further show how optimization expands the possibilities for
accelerating Brownian thermalization down to its fundamental limits. Our
approach paves the way for the design of optimized, finite-time thermodynamic
cycles at the mesoscale. It also offers a platform for investigating
fundamental connections between information geometry and finite-time processes.

<h3>Characterization and Evaluation of Carbonaceous Materials from the  Hydrothermal Carbonization of Waste Pharmaceuticals</h3>

In this paper, we report herein, the conversion of waste prescription and
non-prescription pharmaceuticals into carbonaceous materials. The hydrothermal
carbonization (HTC) of the pharmaceuticals was carried out at temperatures of
180, 230 and 275 0C in closed reactors for 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively.
The main products from the carbonization process were in the solids, liquids
and gas phases. The resulting hydrochars were shown to be very functionalized
with a high degree of aromaticity and high carbon content (between 55% to 65%).
The adsorptive capacity of the hydrochars to remove Pb2+ ions from an aqueous
system was evaluated and compared to that of analytical reagent activated
carbon (AR-AC) through batch adsorptive tests. The effect of contact time on
batch adsorption experiments with an initial Pb2+ concentration of 50 mg/L was
also evaluated. The results indicated that PH24_230 has a better adsorption
capacity when compared to AR-AC; achieving over 97% removal of Pb2+ after 60
minutes. The batch adsorption studies were best described by the pseudo-second
order kinetic model with coefficient of regression (R2) values above 0.99.
Also, slow pyrolysis experiments were carried out to evaluate the difference in
solid yields, char heating value and surface area. Pyrochar yields were
slightly higher, while heating values were one order of magnitude lower when
compared to hydrochars. The pyrolysis conducted at 700{\deg}C led to the
pyrochar with the highest value of the surface area (63.15 m2/g). The study
shows that valuable products can be generated successfully from the
hydrothermal carbonization of waste pharmaceuticals.

The interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking and strong light-matter
coupling in 2D gases brings intriguing aspects to polariton physics. This
combination can lead to polarization/spin selective light-matter interaction in
the strong coupling regime. In this work, we report such a selective strong
light-matter interaction by harnessing a 2D gas in the quantum Hall regime
coupled to a microcavity. Specifically, we demonstrate circular-polarization
dependence of the vacuum Rabi splitting, as a function of magnetic field and
hole density. We provide a quantitative understanding of the phenomenon by
modeling the coupling of optical transitions between Landau levels to the
microcavity. This method introduces a control tool over the spin degree of
freedom in polaritonic semiconductor systems, paving the way for new
experimental possibilities in light-matter hybrids.

A series of new Cr$_{5+x}$Mo$_{35-x}$W$_{12}$Re$_{35}$Ru$_{13}$C$_{20}$
high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have been synthesized and characterized by x-ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electrical resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat measurements. It is found that the HEAs adopt
a noncentrosymmetric cubic $\beta$-Mn type structure and exhibit bulk
superconductivity for 0 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 9. With increasing $x$, the cubic
lattice parameter decreases from 6.7940(3) {\AA} to 6.7516(3) {\AA}. Meanwhile,
the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ is suppressed from 5.49
K to 3.35 K due to the magnetic pair breaking caused by Cr moments. For all
these noncentrosymmetric HEAs, the zero-temperature upper critical field
$B_{\rm c2}$(0) is comparable to Pauli paramagnetic limit $B_{\rm P}$(0) =
1.86$T_{\rm c}$. In particular, the $B_{\rm c2}$(0)/$B_{\rm P}$(0) ratio
reaches a maximum of $\sim$1.03 at $x$ = 6, which is among the highest for
$\beta$-Mn type superconductors.

<h3>Molecular dynamics study of electronic temperature effects on the laser  ablation of silicon</h3>

The molecular dynamics (MD) approach is an effective tool for investigating
atomistic dynamical phenomena at the surface of materials under strong laser
irradiation. Therefore, numerous laser ablation MD simulation studies have been
conducted to date. However, in most MD studies, non-thermal and entropic
effects via hot electrons on interatomic interactions that could cause
significant differences in the simulation results are not considered. In this
study, the MD simulation of the laser ablation of the Si surface was conducted
using an interatomic potential whose parameters depended on the electronic
temperature. Moreover, the results obtained with and without electronic
temperature dependence were compared. The electronic temperature dependence
resulted in an approximately four-times-greater compressive pressure near the
surface, enhanced evaporation of atomic or smaller clusters, and slightly
longer melt depth. Compared to the strong compressive pressure near the
surface, the tensile pressure, which originated from the reflection of the
compressive pressure wave at the surface, and ablation phenomena were less
dependent on the electronic temperature.

Recent attempts at topological materials have revealed a large class of
materials that show gapless surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry
and crystal symmetries. Among them, topological insulating states protected by
crystal symmetries, rather than time-reversal symmetry are classified as
topological crystalline insulators. We computationally predict the signature of
new three-dimensional topological crystalline insulating compounds of space
group 139(I/4mmm). After conducting a full volume optimization process by
allowing to rearrange of atomic positions and lattice parameters, the first
principles calculation with a generalized gradient approximation is utilized to
identify multiple Dirac-type crossings around X and P symmetric points near
Fermi energy. Importantly the band inversion at point P is recognized. Further,
We investigate the compound for topological crystalline insulating behavior and
identify metallic surface states on high-symmetry crystal surfaces with the
projection to the plane (001). Additionally, we performed formation energy,
elastic properties, and phonon modes calculations to verify the structural,
mechanical, and dynamical stability of the compounds. Therefore, we suggest the
compounds for further investigation and experimental realization.

<br>
<br>
The origin of insulating ferromagnetism in epitaxial LaCoO3 films under
tensile strain remains elusive despite extensive research efforts have been
devoted. Surprisingly, the spin state of its Co ions, the main parameter of its
ferromagnetism, is still to be determined. Here, we have systematically
investigated the spin state in epitaxial LaCoO3 thin films to clarify the
mechanism of strain induced ferromagnetism using element-specific x-ray
absorption spectroscopy and dichroism. Combining with the configuration
interaction cluster calculations, we unambiguously demonstrate that Co3+ in
LaCoO3 films under compressive strain (on LaAlO3 substrate) are practically a
low spin state, whereas Co3+ in LaCoO3 films under tensile strain (on SrTiO3
substrate) have mixed high spin and low spin states with a ratio close to 1:3.
From the identification of this spin state ratio, we infer that the dark strips
observed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy indicate
the position of Co3+ high spin state, i.e., an observation of a spin state
disproportionation in tensile-strained LaCoO3 films. This consequently explains
the nature of ferromagnetism in LaCoO3 films.

<h3>Superconducting state generated dynamically from distant pair source and  drain</h3>

<br>
<br>
It has been well established that the origin of p-wave superconductivity is
the balance between pair creation and annihilation, described by the spin-less
fermionic Kitaev model. In this work, we study the dynamics of a composite
system where the pair source and drain are spatially separated by a long
distance. We show that this non-Hermitian system possesses a high-order
exceptional point (EP) when only a source or drain is considered. The EP
dynamics provide a clear picture: A pair source can fully fill the system with
pairs, while a drain can completely empty the system. When the two coexist
simultaneously, the dynamics depend on the distance and the relative phase
between the pair creation and annihilation terms. Analytical analysis and
numerical simulation results show that the superconducting state can be
dynamically established at the resonant pair source and drain: from an initial
empty state to a stationary state with the maximal pair order parameter. It
provides an alternative way of understanding the mechanism of the
nonequilibrium superconducting state.

<br>
<br>
The Gilbert damping of La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ epitaxial films was
studied as a function of temperature and thickness, and the coexistence of
interband and intraband scattering mechanisms is confirmed. The competition
between the two mechanisms with entirely distinct thickness and temperature
dependences results in a complicated damping behavior of the films. Since the
interband scattering is sensitive to the fine electron structure near the Fermi
surface, the distortion of the oxygen octahedra controlled by the film
thickness is an important factor in the control of the damping. Our study
demonstrated that the complicacy of the damping in
La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ epitaxial films is a consequence of
strong-correlation effects, which is the nature of complex transition metal
oxides.

<br>
<br>
In the present paper we investigate the ground state of Tonks-Girardeau gas
under density-dependent gauge potential. With Bose-Fermi mapping method we
obtain the exact ground state wavefunction for the system confined in a
harmonic potential. Based on the ground state wavefunction, the reduced one
body density matrix (ROBDM), natural orbitals and their occupations, and the
momentum distributions are obtained. Compared with the case without gauge
potential, the present wavefunction and ROBDM have additional phase factors
induced by gauge potential. The momentum distribution is the convolution of
that without gauge potential to the Fourier transformation of definite integral
of gauge potential. It is shown that because of the density-dependent gauge
potential the peak of momentum distributions deviate from zero momentum and the
Bose gas take finite total momentum. In particular the momentum distribution is
no longer symmetric although the total momentum can become zero by adding a
constant to the gauge potential.

<br>

We study local density of state (LDOS) oscillations arising from the
scattering of electrons at atomic edge defects in topological insulator (TI)
surfaces. To create edge scattering on the surface of a TI, we assume that half
of its surface is covered with a semiconductor. In addition to modifying the TI
states in the covered half, the presence of the semiconductor leads to a
localized edge potential at the vacuum-semiconductor boundary. We study the
induced LDOS by imposing time-reversal (TR) invariance and current conservation
across the boundary. Additionally, we explore how the scattering of TI
junctions with dissimilar spin textures and anisotropic Fermi velocities affect
the modulations of the LDOS away from the junction edge. In all cases, for
energies close to the Dirac point, we find that the decay envelope of the LDOS
oscillations is insensitive to the scattering at the atomic edge defect, with a
decay power given by $x^{-3/2}$. Quantitative differences in the amplitude of
these oscillations depend on the details of the interface and the spin
textures, while the period of the oscillations is defined by the size of the
Fermi surface.

We report on advanced in-situ magneto-transport measurements in a

imaging and high resolution structural and chemical characterization of the
same sample. Proof-of-principle in-situ Hall measurements on presumably
undemanding nickel thin films supported by micromagnetic simulations reveal
that in samples with non-trivial structures and/or compositions, detailed
knowledge of the latter is indispensable for a thorough understanding and
reliable interpretation of the magneto-transport data. The proposed in-situ
approach is thus expected to contribute to a better understanding of the Hall
signatures in more complex magnetic textures.

We study the dynamics of shear startup of the Johnson-Segalman and
non-stretching Rolie-Poly models using nonlinear simulations. We consider cases
where the startup is from zero shear rate to shear rates in both the monotonic
and nonmonotonic regions of the constitutive curve. For the Johnson-Segalman
model, which exhibits a shear stress overshoot during startup, our nonlinear
simulations show that transient shear banding is absent regardless of whether
the start-up shear rate is in the monotonic or nonmonotonic regions of the
constitutive curve. In the latter case, while there is clearly an inhomogeneity
en route to the banded state, the extent of shear banding is not substantially
large compared to that of the eventual banded state. Marked inhomogeneity in
the velocity profile is predicted for the non-stretching Rolie-Poly model only
if the solvent to solution viscosity ratio is smaller than O(10^(-3), but its
occurrence does not appear to have any correlation with the stress overshoot
during startup. These inhomogeneities are also very sensitive to initial
amplitude of perturbations and the magnitude of Reynolds number. Our nonlinear
simulations show that the transient evolution during shear startup is quite
sensitive to the Reynolds number when the solvent viscosity parameter is much
smaller than unity for non-stretching Rolie-Poly model. However, the results of
the Johnson-Segalman model are very robust for solvent to solution viscosity
greater than O(10^(-3) and do not reveal any transient shear banding during
shear startup.

When SOI-PMOS functions like a capacitor-less 1T-DRAM cell, it is possible
for the number of electrons to be sensed at cryogenic temperatures (5K). We
developed a structure that combines SOI-NMOS and SOI-PMOS with multiple gates
to form a silicon quantum-dot array. In this structure, a variable number of
electrons is injected into the SOI-PMOS body transporting them by means of the
bucket-brigade operation of SOI-NMOS connected in series. The channel-hole
current was changed by the injected electrons due to the body bias effect in
SOI-PMOS, and the change appeared to be step-like, suggesting a dependence on
the elementary charge.

A previously proposed non-canonical coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham density
functional theory (KS-DFT)/Hartree-Fock (HF) treatment for spin-orbit coupling
is here generalized to infinite periodic systems. The scalar-relativistic
periodic KS-DFT/HF solution, obtained with a relativistic effective core
potential, is taken as the zeroth-order approximation. Explicit expressions are
given for the total energy through 3rd-order, which satisfy the 2N + 1 rule
(i.e. requiring only the 1st-order perturbed wave function for determining the
energy through 3rd-order). Expressions for additional 2nd-order corrections to
the perturbed wave function (as well as related one-electron properties) are
worked out at the uncoupled-perturbed level of theory. The approach is
implemented in the \textsc{Crystal} program and validated with calculations of
the total energy, electronic band structure, and density variables of
spin-current DFT on the tungsten dichalcogenide hexagonal bilayer series (i.e.
WSe$_2$, WTe$_2$, WPo$_2$, WLv$_2$), including 6p and 7p elements as a stress
test. The computed properties through second- or third-order match well with
those from reference two-component self-consistent field (2c-SCF) calculations.
For total energies, $E^{(3)}$ was found to consistently improve the agreement
against the 2c-SCF reference values. For electronic band structures, visible
differences w.r.t. 2c-SCF remained through second-order in only the single-most
difficult case of WLv$_2$. As for density variables of spin-current DFT, the
perturbed electron density, being vanishing in first-order, is the most
challenging for the perturbation theory approach. The visible differences in
the electron densities are, however, largest close to the core region of atoms
and smaller in the valence region. Perturbed spin-current densities, on the
other hand, are well reproduced in all tested cases.

Nitrogen vacancy doped SmN$_{1-\delta}$ is a semiconductor which lies in the
intermediary between insulating-ferromagnetic SmN and
metallic-anti-ferromagnetic Sm. The dopant electrons resulting from nitrogen
vacancies have recently been predicted to lie in a band precipitated by a
majority-spin 4$f$ level on the six Sm ions neighbouring each nitrogen vacancy,
an in-gap state $\sim$1 eV below the 4$f$ states in stoichiometric SmN. Optical
data reported here corroborate the prediction along with an extended
computational study. Electrical transport measurements show the transition from
an insulating to metallic state with a hopping type conductivity in dilutely
doped films. We provide strong evidence that electron transport is mediated by
a dispersion-less majority spin defect band implying triplet type
superconductivity, the location of which in the SmN-Sm phase diagram suggests
the location of a quantum critical point.

Polymorphic structures of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host exotic
electronic states, like charge density wave and superconductivity. However, the
number of these structures is limited by crystal symmetries, which poses a
challenge to achieve tailored lattices and properties both theoretically and
experimentally. Here, we report a coloring-triangle (CT) latticed MoTe2
monolayer, termed CT-MoTe2, constructed by controllably introducing uniform and
ordered mirror-twin-boundaries into a pristine monolayer in molecular beam
epitaxy. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
(STM/STS) together with theoretical calculations reveal that the monolayer has
an electronic Janus lattice, i.e., an energy-dependent atomic-lattice and a
pseudo-Te sublattice, and shares the identical geometry with the Mo5Te8 layer.
Dirac-like and flat electronic bands inherently existing in the CT lattice are
identified by two broad and two prominent peaks in STS spectra, respectively,
and verified with density-functional-theory calculations. Two types of
intrinsic domain boundaries were observed, in one of which the
electronic-Janus-lattice feature maintains, implying potential applications as
an energy-tunable electron-tunneling barrier in future functional devices.

The recently discovered vanadium-based Kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A =

wave (CDW) order, band topology and superconductivity. In this paper, by
identifying elementary band representations (EBRs), we construct a two-EBR
minimal model to capture the low-energy van-Hove-singularity dispersion and,
more importantly, the band topology in these Kagome metals. This model consists
of $A_g@3g$ (V-$d_{x^2-y^2/z^2}$, Kagome sites) and $A''_2@2d$ EBRs (Sb1-$p_z$,
honeycomb sites), which form an anti-crossing point on the M$-$L line. We have
investigated the Fermi surface instability by calculating the electronic
susceptibility $\chi_{\mathbf{q}}$. Prominent Fermi-surface nesting peaks are
obtained at three L points, where the $z$ component of the nesting vector shows
intimate relationship with the anti-crossing point. The nesting peaks at L are
consistent with the $2 \times 2 \times 2$ CDW reconstruction in these
compounds. In addition, the sublattice-resolved bare susceptibility is
calculated and similar sharp peaks are observed at the L points, indicating a
strong antiferromagnetic fluctuation. Moreover, our detailed first-principles
calculations show the CDW reconstruction can be initialized by slight
distortions of Sb1 atoms. Assuming a bulk $s$-wave superconducting pairing,
helical surface states and nontrivial superconducting gap are obtained on the
(001) surface. In analogous to FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ superconductor, our results
establish another material realization of a stoichiometric superconductor with
nontrivial band topology, providing a promising platform for studying exotic
Majorana physics in condensed matter.

We reproduce the mirror Chern number phase diagram for the quaternary
compound Pb1-xSnxSe1-yTey combining accurate density functional theory and
tight-biding model. The tight binding models are extracted from ab-initio
results, adding constraints to reproduce the experimental results. By using the
virtual crystalline approximation, we calculated the mirror Chern number as a
function of the concentrations x and y. We report different hamiltonians
depending on whether we want to focus on the experimental band gap or on the
experimental topological transition. We calculate the transition line between
the trivial insulating phase and topological insulating phase that results in
good agreement with the experimental results. Finally, we add in the phase
diagram the Weyl phase predicted in the literature providing a complete
topological phase diagram for the Pb1-xSnxSe1-yTey quaternary compound.

Divergent density of states (DOS) can induce extraordinary phenomena such as
significant enhancement of superconductivity and unexpected phase transitions.
Moreover, van Hove singularities (VHSs) are known to lead to divergent DOS in
two-dimensional (2D) systems. Despite the recent interest in VHSs, only a few
controllable cases have been reported to date. In this work, we investigate the
electronic band structures of a 2D VHS with angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and control transport properties by utilizing an atomically
ultrathin SrRuO$_3$ film. By applying electric fields with alkali metal
deposition and ionic-liquid gating methods, we precisely control the 2D VHS,
and the sign of the charge carrier. Use of a tunable 2D VHS in an atomically
flat oxide film could serve as a new strategy to realize infinite DOS near the
Fermi level, thereby allowing efficient tuning of electric properties.

We construct a class of exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian obtained by
projecting the Hubbard interaction term onto the flat band subspace of a
generic lattice model. These exact eigenstates are many body states in which an
arbitrary number of localized fermionic particles coexist with a sea of mobile
Cooper pairs with zero momentum. By considering the dice lattice as an example,
we provide evidence that these exact eigenstates are in fact manifestation of
local integrals of motions of the projected Hamiltonian. In particular the spin
and particle densities retain memory of the initial state for a very long time,
if localized unpaired particles are present at the beginning of the time
evolution. This shows that many-body localization of quasiparticles and
superfluidity can coexist even in generic two-dimensional lattice models with
flat bands, for which it is not known how to construct local conserved
quantities. Our results open new perspectives on the old condensed matter
problem of the interplay between superconductivity and localization.

the resistive heating as a synthesis method for zirconium oxides (ZrO$_2$). A
wire of Zr has been oxidized to form a core shell structure, in which the core
is the metal wire, and the shell is an oxide layer around 10${\mu}$m thick. The
characterization of the samples has been performed by means of Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM). The chemical composition was analysed by X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy have been
used to assess crystallinity and crystal structure. Photoluminescence (PL) and
cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements have allowed us to study the distribution
of defects along the shell, and to confirm the degree of uniformity. The oxygen
vacancies, either as isolated defects or forming complexes with impurities,
play a determinant role in the luminescent processes. Colour centres, mainly
electron centres as F, F$_A$ and F$_{AA}$, give rise to several visible
emissions extending from blue to green, with main components around 2eV,
2.4-2.5eV and 2.7eV. The differences between PL and CL are also discussed.

High-impedance resonators are a promising contender for realizing
long-distance entangling gates between spin qubits. As material system for the
qubits, semiconductor nanowires with strong spin-orbit interaction are often
employed, working towards a large-scale spin-qubit quantum processor.
Inherently, the fabrication of nanowire based qubits relies on the use of gate
dielectrics which are detrimental to the quality of the resonator. Here, we
investigate loss mechanisms of high-impedance NbTiN resonators in the vicinity
of thermally grown SiO$_2$ and of Al$_2$O$_3$ fabricated by atomic layer
deposition. We benchmark the resonator performance in elevated magnetic fields
and at elevated temperatures and find that the internal quality factors are
limited by the coupling between the resonator and two-level systems of the
employed oxides. Nonetheless, we measure the internal quality factors of
high-impedance resonators to exceed $10^3$ in all investigated oxide
configurations. Because these oxides are commonly used for nanowire-device
fabrication, our results allow for straightforward integration of
high-impedance resonators into a nanowire-based quantum processor. Hence, these
experiments pave the way for large-scale quantum computers based on
semiconductor nanowires.

<h3>Experimental Realization of Geometry-Dependent Skin Effect in a  Reciprocal Two-Dimensional Lattice</h3>

Recent studies of non-Hermitian periodic lattices unveiled the non-Hermitian
skin effect (NHSE), in which the bulk modes under the periodic boundary
conditions (PBC) become skin modes under open boundary conditions (OBC). The
NHSE is a topological effect owing to the non-trivial spectral winding, and
such spectral behaviors appear naturally in non-reciprocal systems. Hence
prevailing approaches rely on non-reciprocity to achieve the NHSE. Here, we
report the experimental realization of the geometry-dependent skin effect
(GDSE) in a two-dimensional (2D) reciprocal system, in which the skin effect
occurs only at boundaries whose macroscopic symmetry mismatches with the
lattice symmetry. The role of spectral reciprocity and symmetry is revealed by
connecting reflective channels at given boundaries with the spectral topology
of the PBC spectrum. Our work highlights the vital role of reciprocity and
macroscopic geometry on the NHSE in systems with dimensions larger than one and
opens new routes for wave structuring using non-Hermitian effects.

A class of septuple-atomic-layer two-dimensional (2D) materials, MA$_2$Z$_4$,
is sought as an alternative to 2D hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides in
the field of valleytronics and spintronics. In these materials, the structural
symmetry can be varied by changing the stacking of its three parts in the
monolayer. We show that in Janus monolayer WSiGeZ$_4$ (Z=N, P, As), the Berry
curvature and Rashba effect are enhanced by modifying the stacking orders.
Intrinsic electric field and composition of the d orbitals play a dominant role
in determining these properties. The vertical field lifts the spin degeneracy
along in-plane direction, inducing the Rashba effect around $\Gamma$ point. The
in-plane orbitals under the influence of in-plane electric field contribute to
the Zeeman splitting of bands at K/K' points. Berry curvature is strengthened
by up to 300% compared to its ground state through symmetry control, along with
a significant increment in the Rashba coefficient. Moreover, monolayer
WSiGeP$_4$ and WSiGeAs$_4$ have multiple valleys, implying another
valley-dimension. We construct a symmetry adapted k.p Hamiltonian for the
valleys and investigate the effect of strain and electric field on the band
structure. The interesting spin-valley physics in monolayer WSiGeZ$_4$ suggests
their exceptional potential for spintronics and valleytronics applications.

Twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steels are high strength metallic
materials with potential for structural components in e.g. automotive
applications. However, they are prone to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and
galvanic corrosion. We investigated the susceptibility of a model Fe 27Mn 0.3C
(wt%) TWIP steel towards HE and oxidation at the sub-nanometer scale by atom
probe tomography. We measured segregation of hydrogen and oxygen at grain
boundaries, which appears to be associated to a strong manganese depletion. Our
study suggests a correlation between HE and oxidation mechanisms in TWIP
steels, which we argue can combine to favor the previously reported hydrogen
enhanced decohesion (HEDE) of grain boundaries.

The intermetallic compound Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$, an antiferromagnetic material
with nonsymmorphic crystalline structure, is investigated by magnetic,
electronic transport and specific heat measurements. Being a Zintl phase,
insulating behavior is expected. Our thermodynamic and magnetotransport
measurements along different crystallographic directions strongly indicate
polaron formation well above the magnetic ordering temperatures. Pronounced
anisotropies of the magnetic and transport properties even above the magnetic
ordering temperature are observed despite the Eu$^{2+}$ configuration which
testify to complex and competing magnetic interactions between these ions and
give rise to intricate phase diagrams discussed in detail. Our results provide
a comprehensive framework for further detailed study of this multifaceted
compound with possible nontrivial topology.

<h3>QS$G\hat{W}$: Quasiparticle Self consistent $GW$ with ladder diagrams in  $W$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06325</a>
<br>
<i>Brian Cunningham, Myrta Grüning, Dimitar Pashov, Mark van Schilfgaarde</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an extension of the quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$
approximation (QS$GW$) [Phys. Rev. B, 76 165106 (2007)] to include vertex
corrections in the screened Coulomb interaction $W$. This is achieved by
solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the polarization matrix at all
$k$-points in the Brillouin zone. We refer to this method as QS$G\hat{W}$.
QS$GW$ yields a reasonable and consistent description of the electronic
structure and optical response, but systematic errors in several properties
appear, notably a tendency to overestimate insulating bandgaps, blue-shift
plasmon peaks in the imaginary part of the dielectric function, and
underestimate the dielectric constant $\epsilon_{\infty}$. A primary objective
of this paper is to assess to what extent including ladder diagrams in $W$
ameliorates systematic errors for insulators in the QS$GW$ approximation. For
benchmarking we consider about 40 well understood semiconductors, and also
examine a variety of less well characterized nonmagnetic systems, six
antiferromagnetic oxides, and the ferrimagnet Fe$_3$O$_4$. We find ladders
ameliorate shortcomings in QS$GW$ to a remarkable degree in both the one-body
Green's function and the dielectric function for a wide range of insulators.
New discrepancies with experiment appear, and a key aim of this paper is to
establish to what extent the errors are systematic and can be traced to
diagrams missing from the theory. One key finding of this work is to establish
a relation between the bandgap and the dielectric constant $\epsilon_{\infty}$.
Good description of both properties together provides a much more robust
benchmark than either alone. We show how this information can be used to
improve our understanding of the one-particle spectral properties in materials
systems such as SrTiO$_3$ and FeO.

Vortex motion in ferromagnetic-superconducting bilayers constituted by thin
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ film deposited on the top of thin manganite
La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ film has been investigated. Both films were
deposited on uniformly twinned single-crystalline substrates and patterned into
strips directed at different angles to the twin lines pattern. These conditions
lead to the guided vortex motion at different angles to the periodic pinning
potential. It has been established that critical current and flux flow
resistance in such an anisotropic pinning landscape-scale follow the elliptic
dependence on the angle of the direction of the strip. For vortex flow at the
directions close to the perpendicular to magnetic domain walls, signatures of
the coherence in the vortex motion have been observed.

<h3>Evolution of phase morphology in dispersed clay systems under the  microwave irradiation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The results of a study of the effect of microvolume emission (power 700 W,
frequency 2.45 GHz) on the structural changes in natural clay particles are
presented. The influence of the irradiation time (10 and 20 minutes) and the
environment in the microwave chamber (atmospheric air and air saturated with
water vapor) on the structural changes occurring in the particles was traced.
During the first 10 minutes, capillary water is completely removed and
agglomeration is carried out by attaching single dispersed particles (diffusion
limited aggregation model). At the second stage (10-20 minutes), already formed
agglomerates (cluster-cluster aggregation model) are growing. A complex of
independent optical-physical methods was used to analyze weak structural
changes. It includes X-ray phase analysis, colorimetry and wavelet analysis.
This approach has made it possible to increase the information content and
reliability of measurements, quantitatively characterize the structural
responses in disperse clay systems. In the air, the removal of capillary water
is accompanied by agglomerations of particles and polymorphic transformations
of oxides: montmorillonite is completely decomposed, amorphous phases
crystallize. The composition of the environment in the microwave chamber
affects the type of phase transformations in iron compounds: iron-alumina is
formed in air, magnetite appear in the water vapor medium. The studies carried
out using the developed set of experimental methods indicate the possibility of
regulating the processes of structure formation in disperse clay systems by
optimizing the regimes of exposure to microwave radiation.

Transition metal dichalchogenides (TMDCs) combine both strong
light-matter-interaction and strong Coulomb-interaction for the formation of
optically excitable excitons. Through radiative feedback control, a mechanism
to control the linewidth can be applied, which modifies optical transition
spectra. We investigate the absorption spectra of TMDCs in a variety of
geometries with respect to non-Markovian exciton-phonon-scattering
contributions. Our approach is based on the self consistent solution of the
microscopic Bloch equations and the macroscopic solution of the wave equation.
This approach allows to discuss the formation of phonon sidebands, which can be
constructively or destructively interfered by applying feedback control. We
discuss in our calculation for $MoSe_2$ embedded in $SiO_2$ the formation of a
phonon sideband and two setups for enhancing or suppressing the phonon sideband
in the spectrum.

<br>
<br>
A computational procedure is developed for the efficient calculation of
derivatives of integrals over non-separable Gaussian-type basis functions, used
for the evaluation of gradients of the total energy in quantum-mechanical
simulations. The approach, based on symbolic computation with computer algebra
systems and automated generation of optimized subroutines, takes full advantage
of sparsity and is here applied to first energy derivatives with respect to
nuclear displacements and lattice parameters of molecules and materials. The
implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} code is presented and the considerably
improved computational efficiency over the previous implementation is
illustrated. To this purpose, three different tasks involving the use of
analytical forces are considered: i) geometry optimization; ii) harmonic
frequency calculation; iii) elastic tensor calculation. Three test case
materials are selected as representatives of different classes: i) a metallic
2D model of the Cu (111) surface; ii) a wide-gap semiconductor ZnO crystal,
with a wurtzite-type structure; and iii) a porous metal-organic crystal, namely
the ZIF-8 Zinc-imidazolate framework. Finally, it is argued that the present
symbolic approach is particularly amenable to generalizations, and its
potential application to other derivatives is sketched.

We unravel the importance of many-body effects on electronic excitations of
freestanding graphene at finite transferred momentum by comparing measured
electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) with ab initio calculations. The loss
function is measured by momentum-resolved EELS in a transmission electron
microscope with high momentum resolution. Calculations are performed at
increasing levels of theory, elucidating the importance of quasi-particle (QP)
corrections and excitonic effects (included within the GW approximation and
Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively). Both effects are essential in the
description of the EEL spectra to obtain a quantitative agreement with
experiments, with the position, dispersion, and shape of both the onset and the
$\pi$ plasmon being significantly affected by excitonic effects.

<br>
<i>Nina Lorenz, Ishan Gupta, Thomas Palberg</i>
<br>
<br>
We study low-salt, binary aqueous suspensions of charged colloidal spheres of
size ratio Phi = 0.57, number densities below the eutectic number density n_E,
and number fractions of p = 1.00-0.40. The typical phase obtained by
solidification from a homogeneous shear-melt is a substitutional alloy of body
centred cubic structure. In strictly gas-tight vials, the polycrystalline solid
is stable against melting and further phase transformation for extended times.
For comparison, we prepare the same samples also by slow and mechanically
undisturbed deionization in commercial slit cells. These cells feature a
complex but well reproducible sequence of global and local gradients in salt
concentration, number density and composition as induced by successive
deionization, phoretic transport and differential settling of the components,
respectively. Moreover, they provide an extended bottom surface suitable for
heterogeneous nucleation of the beta-phase. We give a detailed qualitative
characterization of the crystallization processes using imaging and optical
microscopy. By contrast to the bulk samples, the initial alloy formation in
slit cells is not volume-filling, and we now observe also alpha- and
beta-phases with low solubility of the odd component. In addition to the
initial homogeneous nucleation route, the interplay of gradients opens various
further crystallization and transformation pathways leading to a great
diversity of microstructures. Upon subsequent increase in salt concentration,
crystals melt again. Wall-based, pebble-shaped beta-phase crystals and facetted
alpha-crystals melt last. Our observations suggest that the substitutional
alloys formed in bulk experiments by homogeneous nucleation and subsequent
growth are mechanically stable in the absence of solid-fluid interfaces but
thermodynamically metastable.

<h3>Symmetry breaking for semiconductor excitons induced by Coulomb coupling  between heavy and light holes</h3>

<br>
<i>Shiue-Yuan Shiau, Benoit Eble, Monique Combescot</i>
<br>
<br>
Semiconductor excitons are commonly seen as hydrogen atom. This analogy
requires a unique hole mass. In reality, this is not so due to the complexity
of the semiconductor band structure. The precise consequences on the exciton
physics of the Coulomb coupling between heavy and light holes remain a tricky
open problem. Through an ``optimized perturbative'' approach that uses excitons
with a flexible hole mass as a basis, we show that for zero exciton wave
vector, the heavy-light hole mass difference does not split the $(2\times4)$
exciton degeneracy in zinc-blende-like semiconductors, the hole mass for
binding energy being close to the average mass inverse. By contrast, for
nonzero exciton wave vector, that physically breaks the crystal symmetry, the
exciton degeneracy splits into two branches quantized along the exciton wave
vector, with nontrivial center-of-mass dependence not only on the heavy and
light hole masses, but also on the electron mass.

<h3>Mott-Insulator Ca2RuO4 under a static external electric field</h3>

<i>Giuseppe Cuono, Carmine Autieri</i>
<br>
<br>
We have investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of
the Mott-insulator Ca2RuO4 under the application of a static external electric
field in two regimes: bulk systems at small fields and thin films at large
electric fields. Ca2RuO4 presents an S- and L-Pbca phase with short and long c
lattice constants and with large and small band gaps, respectively. Using
density functional perturbation theory, we have calculated the Born effective
charges as response functions. Once we break the inversion symmetry by
off-centering the Ru atoms, we calculate the piezoelectric properties of the
system that suggest an elongation of the system under an electric field.
Finally, we investigated a four unit cells slab at larger electric fields and
we found insulator-metal transitions induced by the electric field. By looking
at the local density of states, we have found that the gap gets closed on
surface layers while the rest of the sample is insulating. Correlated to the
electric-filed-driven gap closure, there is an increase in the lattice constant
c. Regarding the magnetic properties, we have identified two phase transitions
in the magnetic moments with one surface that gets completely demagnetized at
the largest field investigated. In all cases, the static electric field
increases the lattice constant c and reduces the band gap of Ca2RuO4 playing a
role in the competition between the L-phase and the S-phase.

<br>
<br>
Proteinoids (thermal proteins) are produced by heating amino acids to their
melting point and initiation of polymerisation to produce polymeric chains.
Amino acid-like molecules, or proteinoids, can condense at high temperatures to
create aggregation structures called proteinoid microspheres, which have been
reported to exhibit strong electrical oscillations. When the amino acids
L-Glutamic acid (L-Glu) and L-Aspartic acid (L-Asp) were combined with electric
fields of varying frequencies and intensities, electrical activity resulted. We
recorded electrical activity of the proteinoid microspheres' ensembles via a
pair of differential electrodes. This is analogous to extracellular recording
in physiology or EEG in neuroscience but at micro-level. We discovered that the
ensembles produce spikes of electrical potential, an average duration of each
spike is 26 min and average amplitude is 1 mV. The spikes are typically grouped
in trains of two spikes. The electrical activity of the ensembles can be tuned
by external stimulation because ensembles of proteinoid microspheres can
generate and propagate electrical activity when exposed to electric fields.

The current work describes a novel method of growing thin films of stable
crystalline ST12-Ge, a high pressure polymorph of Ge, on Si substrate by a
non-equilibrium VLS-technique. The study explores the scheme of band
engineering of ST12-Ge by inducing process-stress into it as a function of the
growth temperature and film thickness. In the present work, ST12-Ge films are
grown at 180 C - 250 C to obtain thicknesses of ~4.5-7.5 nm, which possess
extremely good thermal stability up to a temperature of ~350 C. Micro-Raman
study shows the stress induced in such ST12-Ge films to be compressive in
nature and vary in the range of ~0.5-7.5 GPa. The measured direct band gap is
observed to vary within 0.688 eV to 0.711 eV for such stresses, and four
indirect band gaps are obtained to be 0.583 eV, 0.614-0.628 eV, 0.622-0.63 eV
and 0.623-0.632 eV, accordingly. The corresponding band structures for
unstrained and strained ST12-Ge are calculated by performing DFT simulation,
which shows that a compressive stress transforms the fundamental band gap at
M-G valley from indirect to direct one. Henceforth, the possible route of
strain induced band engineering in ST12-Ge is explored by analyzing all the
transitions in strained and unstrained band structures along with
substantiation of the experimental results and theoretical calculations. The
investigation shows that unstrained ST12-Ge is a natural n-type semiconductor
which transforms into p-type upon incorporation of a compressive stress of ~5
GPa, with the in-plane electron effective mass components at M-G band edge to
be ~0.09 me. Therefore, such band engineered ST12-Ge exhibits superior mobility
along with its thermal stability and compatibility with Si, which can have
potential applications to develop high-speed MOS devices for advanced CMOS
technology.

Machine learning models have been widely applied for material property
prediction. However, practical application of these models can be hindered by a
lack of information about how well they will perform on previously unseen types
of materials. Because machine learning model predictions depend on the quality
of the available training data, different domains of the material feature space
are predicted with different accuracy levels by such models. The ability to
identify such domains enables the ability to find the confidence level of each
prediction, to determine when and how the model should be employed depending on
the prediction accuracy requirements of different tasks, and to improve the
model for domains with high errors. In this work, we propose a method to find
domains of applicability using a large feature space and also introduce
analysis techniques to gain more insight into the detected domains and
subdomains.

<h3>A continuum electro-chemo-mechanical gradient theory coupled with  damage: Application to Li-metal filament growth in all-solid-state batteries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06462" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06462</a>

<br>
<br>
We formulate a continuum electro-chemo-mechanical gradient theory which
couples electrochemical reactions with mechanical deformation and damage in
solids. The framework models species transport across the host due to
diffusion/migration and concurrent electrochemical reaction at damaged sites
within the host, where ionic species are reduced to form a new compound. The
theory is fully-coupled with electrodeposition impacting mechanical
deformation, stress generation and damage of the host. Conversely,
electrodeposition kinetics are affected by mechanical stresses via a
thermodynamically-consistent, physically motivated driving force that
distinguishes chemical, electrical and mechanical contributions. The theory
also captures the interplay between growth-induced fracture of the host and
deposition of a new material inside cracks by tracking damage and extent of
electrodeposition via separate phase-field variables.
While the framework is general in nature, we specialize it to model a
Li-metal-Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) system and demonstrate the ability to capture both
intergranular and transgranular crack and Li-filament growth mechanisms, which
have been experimentally observed. In addition, we elucidate how mechanical
confinement in solid-state batteries plays a key role in the resulting
crack/electrodeposition morphology. In modeling this system, we demonstrate the
manner in which our framework can elucidate the critical coupling between
mechanics and electrodeposition kinetics and its role in dictating Li-filament
growth. Beyond this, the framework should serve useful in a number of
engineering problems of relevance in which electrochemical reactions take place
within a damage zone, depositing new material at these sites.

We examine the relaxation process in a quiescent amorphous solid at finite
temperatures, considering the effect of activated rearrangements and long-range
elastic interactions. Our three-dimensional elasto-plastic model shows how the
displacements induced by localized plastic events can result in
faster-than-exponential relaxation. Thermal activation allows for local plastic
activity, which generates elastic responses and cascades of plastic events. To
study the interplay between elastically-dominated and thermally-dominated
dynamics, we introduce tracer particles that follow the displacement field of
plastic activity and also incorporate Brownian motion. Our results reveal that
the dynamic exponents and shape parameter of the dynamical structure factor
depend on this competition and display a crossover from faster-than-exponential
to exponential relaxation as temperature increases, aligning with recent
observations in metallic glasses. Additionally, we find the distribution of
waiting times between activations to be broadly distributed at low
temperatures, providing a measure of dynamical heterogeneity akin to glasses;
yet, no stretched-relaxation is observed.

Heusler alloys with $Ni-Mn-Cu$ (all d-transition metal) composition have been
studied; equilibrium structures for different magnetic configurations are
found. Elastic constants and tetragonal distortion are analyzed. Distortion

<h3>Quantification of electronic and magnetoelastic mechanisms of  first-order magnetic phase transitions from first principles: application to  caloric effects in La(Fe$_x$Si$_{1-x}$)$_{13}$</h3>

La(Fe$_x$Si$_{1-x}$)$_{13}$ and derived quaternary compounds are well-known
for their giant, tunable, magneto- and barocaloric responses around a
first-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition near room temperature with
low hysteresis. Remarkably, such a transition shows a large spontaneous volume
change together with itinerant electron metamagnetic features. While
magnetovolume effects are well-established mechanisms driving first-order
transitions, purely electronic sources have a long, subtle history and remain
poorly understood. Here we apply a disordered local moment picture to quantify
electronic and magnetoelastic effects at finite temperature in
La(Fe$_x$Si$_{1-x}$)$_{13}$ from first-principles. We obtain results in very
good agreement with experiment and demonstrate that the magnetoelastic coupling
drives the first-order character and causes at the same time a huge electronic
entropy contribution to the caloric response.

Understanding material composition-structure-function relationships is of
critical importance for the design and discovery of novel functional materials.
While most such studies focus on individual materials, we conducted a global
mapping study of all known materials deposited in the Material Project database
to investigate their distributions in the space of a set of seven
compositional, structural, physical, and neural latent descriptors. These
two-dimensional materials maps along with their density maps allow us to
illustrate the distribution of the patterns and clusters of different shapes,
which indicates the propensity of these materials and the tinkering history of
existing materials. We then overlap the material properties such as composition
prototypes and piezoelectric properties over the background materials maps to
study the relationships of how material compositions and structures affect
their physical properties. We also use these maps to study the spatial
distributions of properties of known inorganic materials, in particular those
of local vicinities in structural space such as structural density and
functional diversity. These maps provide a uniquely comprehensive overview of
materials and space and thus reveal previously undescribed fundamental
properties. Our methodology can be easily extended by other researchers to
generate their own global material maps with different background maps and
overlap properties for both distribution understanding and cluster-based new
material discovery. The source code for feature generation and generated maps
are available at https://github.com/usccolumbia/matglobalmapping

<h3>Continuous phase transitions between fractional quantum Hall states and  symmetry-protected topological states</h3>

We study quantum phase transitions driven by inter-species interaction in
Bose-Fermi mixtures in a quantum Hall system. In the absence of such
interaction, the bosons and fermions form their respective fractional quantum
Hall (FQH) states. A symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state is identified
as the ground state for strong inter-species interaction. The transitions
between them are proposed to be described by Chern-Simons-Higgs field theories.
For a simple microscopic Hamiltonian, we present numerical evidence for the
existence of the SPT state and a continuous phase transition to the FQH state.
We also find that the entanglement entropy between the bosons and fermions
exhibits scaling behavior in the vicinity of this transition.

<h3>Improper ferroelectricity in ultrathin hexagonal ferrites film</h3>

The suppression of ferroelectricity in ultrathin films of improper
ferroelectric hexagonal ferrites or manganites has been attributed to the
effect of interfacial clamping, however, the quantitative understanding and
related phenomenological model are still lacking. In this work, we report the
paraelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition of epitaxial h-ScFeO3 films with
different thickness through in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction
(RHEED). Based on the interfacial clamping model and the Landau theory, we show
that the thickness-dependence of the ferroelectric Curie temperature can be
understood in terms of the characteristic length of interfacial clamping layer
and the bulk Curie temperature. Furthermore, we found that the critical
thickness of improper ferroelectricity is proportional to the characteristic
length of interfacial clamping layer. These results reveal the essential role
of mechanical clamping from interface on the improper ferroelectricity of
hexagonal ferrites or manganites, and could serve as the guidance to achieve
robust improper ferroelectricity in ultrathin films.

For a stochastic process reset at random times, we discuss to what extent the
probabilities of some orderings of observables associated to the intervals of
time between resetting events are universal, i.e., independent of the choice of
the observables, or independent of the choice of the distribution of intervals.

<h3>Ergodicity-to-localization transition on random regular graphs with  large connectivity and in many-body quantum dots</h3>

Anderson localization on random regular graphs (RRG) serves as a toy-model of
many-body localization (MBL). We explore the transition for ergodicity to
localization on RRG with large connectivity $m$. In the analytical part, we
focus on the inverse participation ratio of eigenstates and identify several
regimes on the ergodic side of the transition -- self-consistent golden rule,
golden rule, precritical, and critical -- that the system consecutively goes
through when the disorder increases towards the point $W_c$ of the localization
transition. We also perform exact-diagonalization numerics as well as a
population-dynamics analysis that combines analytical and numerical techniques.
Results of all the approaches are in excellent mutual agreement. We further
explore the evolution from ergodicity to localization in two models of
Fock-space MBL: fermionic and spin quantum dots. Large-connectivity RRG models
serve as an approximation for this class of many-body problems; one of our
central goals is to better understand the status of this approximation. Our
numerical simulations support the conjecture that, in the limit of a large
system, there is a sharp ergodicity-to-localization transition in the
quantum-dot models. Furthermore, our results are consistent the RRG-like
scaling of the critical disorder, $W_c \sim m \ln m$. While in the golden-rule
range the behavior of quantum-dot models is in agreement with analytical
predictions based on RRG model, substantial deviations occur in the
pre-critical regime. Our results indicate that the pre-critical and critical
behavior (as well as the numerical coefficient in the formula for $W_c$) in the
quantum-dot models may be different from what one would expect from the
RRG-like approximation.

<h3>Plaquette Singlet Transition, Magnetic Barocaloric Effect, and Spin  Supersolidity in the Shastry-Sutherland Model</h3>

Inspired by recent experimental measurements on frustrated quantum magnet
SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ under combined pressure and magnetic fields, we study the
related spin-1/2 Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model using state-of-the-art tensor
network methods. We find amazingly that, in zero magnetic field, there appears
not only a line of first-order plaquette-singlet (PS)/plaquette liquid to
dimer-singlet phase transition and its critical point, but also a second-order
line with its critical endpoint terminating on this first-order line. By
calculating thermodynamics, correlations and susceptibilities, we draw the
finite-temperature phase diagram for the SS model, that well explains two
recent experiments [Guo $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{124}$,
206602 (2020); Jim\'enez $\textit{et al}$., Nature $\textbf{592}$, 370 (2021)].
Beyond the critical point, we uncover prominent magnetic barocaloric responses,
a novel type of quantum correlation induced cooling effect in the strongly
fluctuating supercritical regime. Under finite fields, we identify a quantum
phase transition from the PS phase to the spin supersolid phase that breaks
simultaneously lattice translational and spin rotational symmetries. The
present findings on the SS model are accessible in current experiments and
would shed new light on exotic critical and supercritical phenomena in the
archetypal frustrated quantum magnets such as SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.

Topological bosonic excitations must, in contrast to their fermionic
counterparts, appear at finite energies. This is a key challenge for magnons,
as it prevents straightforward excitation and detection of
topologically-protected magnonic edge states and their use in magnonic devices.
In this work, we show that in a non-equilibrium state, in which the
magnetization is pointing against the external magnetic field, the
topologically-protected chiral edge states in a magnon Chern insulator can be
lowered to zero frequency, making them directly accessible by existing
experimental techniques. We discuss the spin-transfer torque required to
stabilize this non-equilibrium state, and show explicitly using numerical
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations that the edge states can be excited with a
microwave field. Finally, we consider a propagating spin wave spectroscopy
experiment, and demonstrate that the edge states can be directly detected.
