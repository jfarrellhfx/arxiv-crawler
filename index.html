Rigorous understanding of the self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals is
crucial to the development of tailored nanostructured materials. Despite
extensive studies, a mechanistic understanding of self-assembly under
non-equilibrium driven by an external field remains an ongoing challenge. We
demonstrate self-assembly by optical tweezers imposing an external attractive
field for cubic-phase sodium yttrium fluoride nanocrystals. We show that
surface roughness of the nanocrystals is a decisive factor for contact leading
to assembly between the nanocrystals, manifested by the roughness-dependent
hydrodynamic resistivity. This provides direct evidence that dynamics are
equally important to energetics in understanding self-assembly. These results
have implications in a wide variety of different fields, such as in
understanding the factors that mediate oriented attachment-based crystal growth
or in interpreting the structure of binding sites on viruses.

<h3>Double Fountain Effect in Superfluid Helium</h3>

A double fountain pressure model is used to analyze the recent measurements
of Yu and Luo (arXiv2211.02236v4) of superfluid $^4$He flow between two
chambers held at different temperatures via two superleaks and an intervening
third chamber that spontaneously achieves a temperature higher than both fixed
temperatures. The physical origin of the increased temperature in the
intervening chamber is attributed to the balance between the rate of mechanical
energy deposited by superfluid transport and the rate of convection back to the
lower temperature chambers. An equation is given for the pressure of the third
chamber, the measurement of which would confirm or refute the theory.

<h3>Photocatalytic active ZnO$_{1-x}$S$_x$@CNTs heteronanostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05974" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05974</a>
<br>
<i>Andjelika Bjelajac, Ileana Florea, Mihai Zamfir, Sandrine Tusseau Nenez, Costel Sorin Cojocaru</i>
<br>
<br>
Herein, we report on the use of vertically aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) films as support for ZnO/ZnS photocatalytic active nanostructures. The
CNTs were synthetized via a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HfCVD),
using Fe catalyst on top of Al$_2$O$_3$ buffer layer. Controlled point defects
in the CNTs outer walls were created by exposure to a low pressure nonthermal
water vapors diffusive plasma and acted as seeds for subsequent
pulsed-electrodeposition of Zn nanoparticles. This was to achieve a direct and
improved contact between the nanoparticles and CNTs. To obtain ZnO, ZnS and mix
phase of ZnO/ZnS spread on CNTs, the oxidation, sulfurization and 2 steps
subsequent annealing in oxygen and sulfur rich atmospheres were applied. High
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with energy dispersive
X-rays spectroscopy (EDS) in scanning mode, provided the chemical mapping of
the structures. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses proved the hexagonal phase of
ZnO and ZnS, obtained after oxidation in H$_2$O and S vapors, respectively. In
the case of the samples obtained by the 2 steps subsequent annealing, XRD
showed mainly the presence of ZnO and a small amount of ZnS. The benefit of the
secondary annealing in S vapor was seen as absorption enhancement of the
ZnO$_{1-x}$S$_x$@CNTs sample having the absorption edge at 417 nm, whereas the
absorption edge of ZnO@CNTs was 408 nm and of ZnS@CNTs 360 nm. For all the
samples, compared to the bare ZnO and ZnS, the absorption red shift was
observed which is attributed to the CNTs involvement. Therefore, this study
showed the double sides benefit to induce the absorption of ZnO of the visible
light, one from S doping and second of CNTs involvement. The absorption
enhancement had a positive impact on photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue
dye, showing that ZnO$_{1-x}$S$_x$@CNTs heteronanostructure was the best
photocatalyst among the studied samples.

Geometric confinement and topological constraints present promising means of
controlling active materials. By combining analytical arguments derived from
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation with numerical simulations, we investigate
the simultaneous impact of confinement together with curvature singularity by
characterizing the dynamics of an active nematic on a cone. Here, the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation means that textures can follow defect positions
rapidly on the time scales of interest. Upon imposing strong anchoring boundary
conditions at the base of a cone, we find a a rich phase diagram of
multi-defect dynamics including exotic periodic orbits of one or two $+1/2$
flank defects, depending on activity and non-quantized geometric charge at the
cone apex. By characterizing the transitions between these ordered dynamical
states, we can understand (i) defect unbinding, (ii) defect absorption and
(iii) defect pair nucleation at the apex. Numerical simulations confirm
theoretical predictions of not only the nature of the circular orbits but also
defect unbinding from the apex.

<h3>Pair-breaking scattering interference as a mechanism for superconducting  gap modulation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06024" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06024</a>
<br>
<i>Zhi-Qiang Gao, Yu-Ping Lin, Dung-Hai Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose the "pair-breaking scattering interference" as a general source of
coherence peak modulations in superconductors. Assuming this mechanism, we
present a simple physical picture for the coherence peak modulations in
overdoped cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi-2223),
ferromagnetic iron pnictide EuRbFe$_4$As$_4$ (Eu-1144), and kagome metals
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, and Cs). Specifically, we explain the wavevectors,
the particle-hole symmetry, and the dependence on the internal or external
Zeeman-field of the coherence peak modulations. This work is intended as a
cautious reminder to the scientific community when asserting the existence of a
pair density wave phenomenon in the absence of tunneling conductance
modulations in the normal state.

<h3>Interaction-driven quantum phase transition of a single magnetic  impurity in Fe(Se,Te)</h3>

<br>
Understanding the interplay between individual magnetic impurities and
superconductivity is crucial for bottom-up construction of novel phases of
matter. For decades, the description by Yu, Shiba and Rusinov (YSR) of single
spins in a superconductor and its extension to include quantum effects has
proven highly successful: the pair-breaking potential of the spin generates
sub-gap electron- and hole excitations that are energetically equidistant from
zero. By tuning the energy of the sub-gap states through zero, the impurity
screening by the superconductor makes the ground state gain or lose an
electron, signalling a parity breaking quantum phase transition. Here we show
that in multi-orbital impurities, correlations between the in-gap states can
conversely lead to a quantum phase transition where more than one electron
simultaneously leave the impurity without significant effect of the screening
by the superconductor, while the parity may remain unchanged. This finding
implies that the YSR treatment is not always valid, and that intra-atomic
interactions, particularly Hund's coupling that favours high spin
configurations, are an essential ingredient for understanding the sub-gap
states. The interaction-driven quantum phase transition should be taken into
account for impurity-based band-structure engineering, and may provide a
fruitful basis in the search for novel physics.

<h3>Influence of a Realistic Multiorbital Band Structure on Conducting  Domain Walls in Perovskite Ferroelectrics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06043" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06043</a>
<br>
<i>B.C. Cornell, W.A. Atkinson</i>
<br>
<br>
Domain wall morphologies in ferroelectrics are believed to be largely shaped
by electrostatic forces. Here, we show that for conducting domain walls, the
morphology also depends on the details of the charge-carrier band structure.
For concreteness, we focus on transition-metal perovskites like BaTiO$_3$ and
SrTiO$_3$. These have a triplet of $t_{2g}$ orbitals attached to the Ti atoms
that form the conduction bands when electron doped. We solve a set of coupled
equations -- Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) equations for the polarization,
tight-binding Schr\"odinger equations for the electron bands, and Gauss' law
for the electric potential -- to obtain polarization and electron density
profiles as a function of electron density. We find that at low electron
densities, the electron gas is pinned to the surfaces of the ferroelectric by a
Kittel-like domain structure. As the electron density increases, the domain
wall evolves smoothly through a zigzag head-to-head structure, eventually
becoming a flat head-to-head domain wall at high density. We find that the
Kittel-like morphology is protected by orbital asymmetry at low electron
densities, while at large electron densities the high density of states of the
multiorbital band structure provides effective screening of depolarizing fields
and flattens the domain wall relative to single-orbital models. Finally, we
show that in the zigzag phase, the electron gas develops tails that extend away
from the domain wall, in contrast to na\"{i}ve expectations.

<h3>Emergence of ferromagnetism at the onset of moiré Kondo breakdown</h3>

The interaction of a lattice of localized magnetic moments with a sea of
conduction electrons in Kondo lattice models induces rich quantum phases of
matter, such as Fermi liquids with heavily renormalized electronic
quasiparticles, quantum critical non-Fermi liquid metals and unconventional
superconductors, among others. The recent demonstration of moir\'e Kondo
lattices has opened the door to investigate the Kondo problem with continuously
tunable parameters. Although a heavy Fermi liquid phase has been identified in
moir\'e Kondo lattices, the magnetic phases and Kondo breakdown transitions
remain unexplored. Here we report a density-tuned Kondo destruction in
AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers by combining magneto transport and
optical studies. As the itinerant carrier density decreases, the Kondo
temperature decreases. At a critical density, we observe a heavy Fermi liquid
to insulator transition, and a nearly concomitant emergence of ferromagnetic
order. The observation is consistent with the scenario of a ferromagnetic
Anderson insulator and suppression of the Kondo screening effect. Our results
pave the path for inducing other exotic quantum phase transitions in moir\'e
Kondo lattices.

<h3>The foundations of statistical physics: entropy, irreversibility, and  inference</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06070" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06070</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan Asher Pachter, Ying-Jen Yang, Ken A. Dill</i>
<br>
<br>
Statistical physics aims to describe properties of macroscale systems in
terms of distributions of their microscale agents. Its central tool is the
maximization of entropy, a variational principle. We review the history of this
principle, first considered as a law of nature, more recently as a procedure
for inference in model-making. And while equilibria (EQ) have long been
grounded in the principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), until recently no
equally foundational generative principle has been known for non-equilibria
(NEQ). We review evidence that the variational principle for NEQ is Maximum
Caliber. It entails maximizing \textit{path entropies}, not \textit{state
entropies}. We also describe the role of entropy in characterizing
irreversibility, and describe the relationship between MaxCal and other
prominent approaches to NEQ physics, including Stochastic Thermodynamics (ST),
Large Deviations Theory (LDT), Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT), and
non-extensive entropies.

<h3>A trion in a magnetic field revisited</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06091" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06091</a>
<br>
<i>I. A. Aleksandrov, A. Kudlis, I. A. Shelykh</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the problem of a two dimensional trion in an external magnetic
field. We demonstrate that the approximations used previously for finding the
energy spectrum of this system break down in the experimentally accessible
range of magnetic fields. It is shown that the neglect of the Coulomb-induced
mixing of different Landau levels corresponding to non-interacting particles
leads to a strong underestimation of the trion binding energies even at
extremely high magnetic fields (hundreds of Tesla). Moreover, proper account of
the Coulomb effects for certain values of the parameters can lead to the
appearance of additional discrete trion states which were overlooked
previously. Finally, we provide a database of the matrix elements necessary for
calculation of the magnetotrion spectra for a wide class of materials.

<h3>Predicting New Heavy Fermion Materials within Carbon-Boron Clathrate  Structures</h3>

Heavy fermion materials have been a rich playground for strongly correlated
physics for decades. However, engineering tunable and synthesizable heavy
fermion materials remains a challenge. We strive to integrate heavy fermion
properties into carbon boron clathrates as a universal structure which can host
a diverse array of interesting physical phenomena. Using a combination of
density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory, we study two rare
earth carbon boron clathrates, SmB$_3$C$_3$ and CeB$_3$C$_3$, and explore
properties arising from the strong electronic correlations. We find a
significant increase in the density of states at the Fermi level in
CeB$_3$C$_3$ as the temperature is lowered, indicating the development of a
heavy electron state. In SmB$_3$C$_3$, a potential Kondo insulating state is
identified. Both findings point to rare earth carbon boron clathrates as novel
strongly correlated materials within a universally tunable structure, offering
a fresh platform to innovate upon conventional heavy-fermion materials design.

<h3>Colossal c-axis response and lack of rotational symmetry breaking within  the kagome plane of the CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductor</h3>

<br>
<br>
The kagome materials AV4$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) host an intriguing
interplay between unconventional superconductivity and charge-density-waves.
Here, we investigate CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ by combining high-resolution
thermal-expansion, heat-capacity and electrical resistance under strain
measurements. We directly unveil that the superconducting and charge-ordered
states strongly compete, and that this competition is dramatically influenced
by tuning the crystallographic c-axis. In addition, we report the absence of
additional bulk phase transitions within the charge-ordered state, notably
associated with rotational symmetry-breaking within the kagome planes. This
suggests that any breaking of the C$_6$ invariance occurs via different
stacking of C$_6$-symmetric kagome patterns. Finally, we find that the
charge-density-wave phase exhibits an enhanced A$_{1g}$-symmetric
elastoresistance coefficient, whose large increase at low temperature is driven
by electronic degrees of freedom.

<h3>Design and Performance of Parallel-channel Nanocryotrons in Magnetic  Fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06108</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We introduce a new design modification to conventional geometry of the
cryogenic three-terminal switch, the nanocryotron (nTron). The conventional
geometry of nTrons is modified by including parallel current-carrying channels,
an approach aimed at enhancing the device's performance in magnetic field
environments. The common challenge in nTron technology is to maintain efficient
operation under varying magnetic field conditions. Here we show that the
adaptation of parallel channel configurations leads to an enhanced gate signal
sensitivity, an increase in operational gain, and a reduction in the impact of
superconducting vortices on nTron operation within magnetic fields up to 1
Tesla. Contrary to traditional designs that are constrained by their effective
channel width, the parallel nanowire channels permits larger nTron cross
sections, further bolstering the device's magnetic field resilience while
improving electro-thermal recovery times due to reduced local inductance. This
advancement in nTron design not only augments its functionality in magnetic
fields but also broadens its applicability in technological environments,
offering a simple design alternative to existing nTron devices.

<h3>Assessment of slip transfer criteria for prismatic-to-prismatic slip in  pure Ti from 3D grain boundary data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06118" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06118</a>
<br>
<i>E. Nieto-Valeiras, E. Ganju, N. Chawla, J. LLorca</i>
<br>
<br>
Slip transfer and blocking across grain boundaries was studied in a Ti foil
with a strong rolling texture deformed in tension. Prior to deformation, the
shape of the grains and the orientation of the grain boundaries were quantified
through laboratory scale diffraction contrast tomography (LabDCT). Mechanical
deformation led to the activation of <a> prismatic slip, and slip
transfer/blocking was assessed in > 300 grain boundaries by means of slip trace
analysis and electron backscatter diffraction. A categorical model was employed
to accurately assess slip transfer, and the "F1 score" of various slip transfer
criteria proposed in the literature was evaluated for the first time from 3D
grain boundary information. Remarkably, for the prismatic-dominated slip
transfer in the current Ti sample, the results show that the best predictions
of slip transfer/blocking are provided by the angle \k{appa}, which is directly
related to the residual Burgers vector, and by the Luster-Morris parameter m'.
In contrast, metrics based on the twist angle {\theta} and on the LRB criterion
were not able to predict accurately slip transfer/blocking. Thus, the extensive
analysis of the 3D grain boundary data and the novel application of LabDCT was
able to help clarify the role of grain boundary orientation on the mechanisms
of plastic deformation in polycrystals with strong prismatic-dominated slip.

<h3>Critical phenomena of RNA-like polymers -- a synopsis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06126</a>
<br>
<i>R. Dengler</i>
<br>
<br>
This work examines field theories for RNA-like polymers with single strand
and double strand polymers and a periodic base sequence. These field theories
originate from lattice models, describe polymers in a good solvent, and in
principle exactly describe the critical behavior. A central role is played by
the conventional one-component branched polymer and the mapping of the
corresponding field theory to the Lee-Yang field theory in two less dimensions.
Critical phenomena in the context of polymers as well as the Lee-Yang model
entail pecularities, which we derive in detail. A new result is that the
critical point of RNA-like branched polymers (with periodic base sequence)
looks like the critical point of the classical one-component branched polymer,
but with one more critical exponent for the single strand polymer. A random
base sequence generates additional relevant interactions, and invalidates the
simple picture.

<h3>Exact quench dynamics of the Floquet quantum East model at the  deterministic point</h3>

<br>
We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the Floquet quantum East model (a
Trotterized version of the kinetically constrained quantum East spin chain) at
its "deterministic point", where evolution is defined in terms of CNOT
permutation gates. We solve exactly the thermalization dynamics for a broad
class of initial product states by means of "space evolution". We prove: (i)
the entanglement of a block of spins grows at most at one-half the maximal
speed allowed by locality (i.e., half the speed of dual-unitary circuits); (ii)
if the block of spins is initially prepared in a classical configuration, speed
of entanglement is a quarter of the maximum; (iii) thermalization to the
infinite temperature state is reached exactly in a finite time that scales with
the system size.

<h3>Ions-induced Epitaxial Growth of Perovskite Nanocomposites for Highly  Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes with EQE Exceeding 30%</h3>

Cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) is a widely used emitter for perovskite
light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), benefiting from its large carrier mobility,
high color purity and good thermal stability. However, the three-dimensional
CsPbBr3 films encounter challenges due to their massive intrinsic defects and
weak exciton binding effect, which limited their electroluminescence
efficiency. To address this issue, the prevailing approach is to confine
carriers by reducing dimensionality or size. Nonetheless, this method results
in an increase in surface trap states due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio
and presents difficulties in carrier injection and transport after reducing
lattice splitting to smaller sizes. Here, we successfully achieved proper
control over film crystallization by introducing sodium ions, which facilitate
the epitaxial growth of zero-dimensional Cs4PbBr6 on the surface of CsPbBr3,
forming large grain matrixes where CsPbBr3 is encapsulated by Cs4PbBr6.
Notably, the ions-induced epitaxial growth enables the CsPbBr3 emitter with
significantly reduced trap states, and generates coarsened nanocomposites of
CsPbBr3&Cs4PbBr6 with grain size that surpass the average thickness of the thin
perovskite film, resulting in a wavy surface conducive to light out-coupling.
Additionally, another additive of formamidinium chloride was incorporated to
assist the growth of nanocomposites with larger size and lower defects as well
as better carrier injection and transportation. As a result, our demonstrated
PeLEDs based on the coarsened nanocomposites exhibit low nonradiative
recombination, enhanced light extraction and well-balanced carrier
transportation, leading to high-performance devices. The champion device
achieved an external quantum efficiency of 31.0% at the emission peak of 521 nm
with a narrow full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 18 nm.

<h3>Field-controlled dynamics of skyrmions and monopoles</h3>

<br>
Magnetic monopoles, despite their ongoing experimental search as elementary
particles, have inspired the discovery of analogous excitations in condensed
matter systems. In chiral condensed matter systems, emergent monopoles are
responsible for the onset of transitions between topologically distinct states
and phases, like in the case of transitions from helical and conical phase to
A-phase comprising periodic arrays of skyrmions. By combining numerical
modeling and optical characterizations, we describe how different geometrical
configurations of skyrmions terminating at monopoles can be realized in liquid
crystals and liquid crystal ferromagnets. We demonstrate how such complex
structures can be effectively manipulated by external magnetic and electric
fields. Furthermore, we discuss how our findings may hint at similar dynamics
in other physical systems, and their potential applications.

<h3>Photostrictive Effect and Structure Phase Transition via Nonlinear  Photocurrent</h3>

The phenomena of crystal size changes and structural phase transitions
induced by light irradiation have garnered significant interest due to their
potential for tuning and controlling a wide range of material properties
through highly cooperative interactions. However, a microscopic theory that can
comprehensively explain these phenomena in correlation with photon frequency
and polarization has remained highly desirable. In this work, we propose that
nonlinear photocurrent may correspond to driving these effects, which arise
from a competition between light-injected energy and structural variations. By
conducting first-principles simulations and comparing them with two established
experiments, we show that shift current, a second-order photocurrent, can
induce photostriction and nonreciprocal structure phase transitions. The
quantitative comparisons across key parameters such as light frequency,
irradiation time, polarization, and intensity provide further support for the
nonlinear photocurrent mechanism. Beyond shift current, this microscopic
understanding proposes to utilize more types of nonlinear photocurrent to
enhance light-structure interactions and control material properties.

<h3>Non-Drude THz conductivity of graphene due to structural distortions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The remarkable electrical, optical and mechanical properties of graphene make
it a desirable material for electronics, optoelectronics and quantum
applications. A fundamental understanding of the electrical conductivity of
graphene across a wide frequency range is required for the development of such
technologies. In this study, we use terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy to
measure the complex dynamic conductivity of electrostatically gated graphene,
in a broad $\sim$0.1 - 7 THz frequency range. The conductivity of doped
graphene follows the conventional Drude model, and is predominantly governed by
intraband processes. In contrast, undoped charge-neutral graphene exhibits a
THz conductivity that significantly deviates from Drude-type models. Via
quantum kinetic equations and density matrix theory, we show that this
discrepancy can be explained by additional interband processes, that can be
exacerbated by electron backscattering. We propose a mechanism where such
backscattering -- which involves flipping of the electron pseudo-spin -- is
mediated by the substantial vector scattering potentials that are associated
with structural deformations of graphene. Our findings highlight the
significant impact that structural distortions and resulting electrostatic
vector scattering potentials can have on the THz conductivity of charge-neutral
graphene. Our results emphasise the importance of the planar morphology of
graphene for its broadband THz electronic response.

<h3>Mapping of Spin-Wave Transport in Thulium Iron Garnet Thin Films Using  Diamond Quantum Microscopy</h3>

Spin waves, collective dynamic magnetic excitations, offer crucial insights
into magnetic material properties. Rare-earth iron garnets offer an ideal
spin-wave (SW) platform with long propagation length, short wavelength,
gigahertz frequency, and applicability to magnon spintronic platforms. Of
particular interest, thulium iron garnet (TmIG) has attracted a huge interest
recently due to its successful growth down to a few nanometers, observed
topological Hall effect and spin orbit torque-induced switching effects.
However, there is no direct spatial measurement of its SW properties. This work
uses diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) magnetometry in combination with SW
electrical transmission spectroscopy to study SW transport properties in TmIG
thin films. NV magnetometry allows probing spin waves at the sub-micrometer
scale, seen by the amplification of the local microwave magnetic field due to
the coupling of NV spin qubits with the stray magnetic field produced by the
microwave-excited spin waves. By monitoring the NV spin resonances, the SW
properties in TmIG thin films are measured as function of the applied magnetic
field, including their amplitude, decay length (~ 50 um), and wavelength (0.8 -
2 um). These results pave the way for studying spin qubit-magnon interactions
in rare-earth magnetic insulators, relevant to quantum magnonics applications.

<br>
<br>
Pair spin-orbit interaction can emerge in strongly-interacting systems
characterized by a large spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the role of this
interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases.
We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a
combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is
reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge,
channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the
form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum.
Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to
Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend
of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or
the other.

<h3>Does the slope of $H_{c2}$ close to $T_c$ measure the size of the Cooper  pairs?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06220" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06220</a>
<br>
<i>František Herman, Richard Hlubina</i>
<br>
<br>
The size of the Cooper pair $\xi_{\rm pair}$ is one of the basic
characteristics of a superconductor, but it is not possible to measure it
directly. It has been suggested that $\xi_{\rm pair}$ can be determined from
the value $\xi_{\rm slope}$ extracted from the measurement of the slope of
$H_{c2}$ close to $T_c$. Taking into account both pair-conserving and
pair-breaking scattering on impurities within the recently developed theory of
Dynes superconductors, we perform an explicit calculation of $\xi_{\rm pair}$
and $\xi_{\rm slope}$. We show that the two quantities agree only in clean
superconductors. In particular, when the pair-breaking disorder approaches the
quantum critical point, $\xi_{\rm pair}$ stays finite, whereas $\xi_{\rm
slope}$ diverges.

<h3>Emergent Classical Spin Liquid Phases in an Ising Lattice via Size  Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06244" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06244</a>
<br>
<i>Pratik Brahma, Sayeef Salahuddin</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that a classical spin liquid phase can emerge from an ordered
magnetic state in the two-dimensional frustrated Shastry-Sutherland Ising
lattice due to lateral confinement. Two distinct classical spin liquid states
are stabilized (i) long-range spin-correlated dimers, and (ii) exponentially
decaying spin-correlated disordered states, depending on widths of W=3n, 3n+1
or W=3n+2, n being a positive integer. Stabilization of spin liquids in a
square-triangular lattice moves beyond the conventional geometric paradigm of
kagome, triangular or tetrahedral arrangements of antiferromagnetic ions, where
spin liquids have been discussed conventionally.

A scanning helium microscope typically utilises a thermal energy helium atom
beam, with an energy and wavelength (<100 meV, ~0.05 nm) particularly sensitive
to surface structure. An angular detector stage for a scanning helium
microscope is presented that facilitates the in-situ measurement of scattering
distributions from a sample. We begin by demonstrating typical elastic and
inelastic scattering from ordered surfaces. We then go on to show the role of
topography in diffuse scattering from disordered surfaces, observing deviations
from simple cosine scattering. In total, these studies demonstrate the wealth
of information that is encoded into the scattering distributions obtained with
the technique.

<h3>Yield Stress Fluids Solidifying in Capillary Imbibition</h3>

<br>
<br>
When subjected to an external stress that exceeds the yield stress
($\sigma_\mathrm{Y}$), yield stress fluids (YSFs) undergo a solid-to-liquid
transition. Despite the extensive studies, there has been limited attention to
the process of liquid-to-solid transition. This work examines the
solidification of YSFs through capillary imbibition, easily observed in the
processes of wetting, coating, spreading, and wicking. During gradual
deceleration of the capillary rise, YSFs display an unexpected flowing
behavior, even when subjected to stresses below the $\sigma_\mathrm{Y}$. We
propose a model with numerical solutions based on rheological properties of
YSFs and slip to capture this unusual, yet universal behavior.

<h3>Improved iron-tolerance in recycled aluminum alloys via direct strip  casting process</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Recycled aluminum alloys are pivotal for sustainable manufacturing, offering
strength, durability, and environmental advantages. However, the presence of
iron (Fe) impurities poses a major challenge, undermining their properties and
recyclability. Conventional manufacturing processes result in coarse Fe-rich
intermetallic compounds that limit the tolerance of Fe content and negatively
influence performance of advanced aluminum alloys. To address this, rapid
solidification techniques like direct strip casting have been explored. In this
work, a detailed study of the strip cast microstructure was conducted by
scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction and atom probe
tomography. Our results reveal that alloys produced by DSC exhibit
significantly refined microstructures and are free from coarse Fe-rich
intermetallics, thereby retaining the majority of Fe in solid solution. These
findings indicate that strip casting significantly enhances Fe-tolerance in
aluminum alloys, making it an attractive process for future aluminum recycling,
with implications for sustainable high-performance applications.

<h3>Improved charge storage capacity of supercapacitor electrodes by  engineering surfaces: the case of Janus MXenes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Surface Engineering in two-dimensional(2D) materials has turned out to be an
useful technique to improve their functional properties. By designing Janus
compounds MM$^{\prime}$C in MXene family of compounds M$_{2}$C where the two
surfaces are constituted by two different transition metal M and M$^{\prime}$,
we have explored their potentials as electrodes in a supercapacitor with acidic
electrolyte. Using Density functional Theory (DFT) \cite{dft} in conjunction
with classical solvation model we have made an in depth analysis of the
electrochemical parameters of three Janus MXenes, passivated by oxygen - NbVC,
MnVC and CrMnC. Comparisons with the corresponding end point MXenes Nb$_{2}$C,
V$_{2}$C, Mn$_{2}$C and Cr$_{2}$C are also made. We find that the surface redox
activity enhances due to formation of Janus, improving the charge storage
capacities of MXene electrodes significantly. Our analysis reveals that the
improved functionality has its root in the variations in the charge state of
one of the constituents in the Janus compound which, in turn, has its origin in
the electronic structure changes due to the surface manipulation. Our work,
which is the first on the electrochemical properties of Janus MXenes for
supercapacitor applications, suggests the surface engineering by forming
appropriate Janus compounds as a possible route to extract high power density
in a MXene electrode-acidic electrolyte based energy storage devices.

<h3>Large out-of-plane spin-orbit torque in topological Weyl semimetal  candidate TaIrTe4</h3>

<br>
Topological quantum materials, with novel spin textures and broken crystal
symmetries are suitable candidates for spintronic memory technologies. Their
unique electronic properties, such as protected surface states and exotic
quasiparticles, can provide an out-of-plane spin polarized current needed for
external field free magnetization switching of magnets with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy. Conventional spin-orbit torque materials, such as heavy
metals and topological insulators, provide only an in-plane spin polarized
current, and recently explored materials with lower crystal symmetries provide
very low out-of-plane spin polarized current components, which is not suitable
for energy-efficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) applications. Here, we demonstrate
a large out-of-plane damping-like SOT at room temperature using a topological
Weyl semimetal candidate TaIrTe4 with a lower crystal symmetry. We performed
spin-orbit torque ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR) experiments in a
TaIrTe4/Ni80Fe20 heterostructure and observed a large out-of-plane damping-like
SOT efficiency. The out-of-plane spin Hall conductivity is estimated to be an
order of magnitude higher than the reported values in other materials. These
findings of high spin Hall conductivity and large out-of-plane SOT efficiency
are suitable for the development of energy efficient and external field-free
spintronic devices.

<br>
<br>
We study the single-particle properties of two-dimensional quasicrystals
where the underlying geometry of the tight-binding lattice is crystalline but
the on-site potential is quasicrystalline. We will focus on the 2D generalised
Aubry-Andr\'e model which has a varying form to its quasiperiodic potential,
through a deformation parameter and varied irrational periods of cosine terms,
which allows a continuous family of on-site quasicrystalline models to be
studied. We show that the 2D generalised Aubry-Andr\'e model exhibits
single-particle mobility edges between extended and localised states and a
localisation transition in a similar manner to the prior studied
one-dimensional limit. However, we find that such models in two dimensions are
dominated across large parameter regions by critical states. The presence of
critical states results in anomalous mobility edges between both extended and
critical and localised and critical states in the single-particle spectrum,
even when there is no mobility edge between extended and localised states
present. Due to this, these models exhibit anomalous diffusion of initially
localised states across the majority of parameter regions, including deep in
the normally localised regime. The presence of critical states in large
parameter regimes and throughout the spectrum will have consequences for the
many-body properties of quasicrystals, including the formation of the Bose
glass and the potential to host a many-body localised phase.

<h3>Machine Eye for Defects: Machine Learning-Based Solution to Identify and  Characterize Topological Defects in Textured Images of Nematic Materials</h3>

Topological defects play a key role in the structures and dynamics of liquid
crystals (LCs) and other ordered systems. There is a recent interest in
studying defects in different biological systems with distinct textures.
However, a robust method to directly recognize defects and extract their
structural features from various traditional and nontraditional nematic systems
remains challenging to date. Here we present a machine learning solution,
termed Machine Eye for Defects (MED), for automated defect analysis in images
with diverse nematic textures. MED seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art
object detection networks, Segment Anything Model, and vision transformer
algorithms with tailored computer vision techniques. We show that MED can
accurately identify the positions, winding numbers, and orientations of $\pm
1/2$ defects across distinct cellular contours, sparse vector fields of nematic
directors, actin filaments, microtubules, and simulation images of Gay--Berne
particles. MED performs faster than conventional defect detection method and
can achieve over 90\% accuracy on recognizing $\pm1/2$ defects and their
orientations from vector fields and experimental tissue images. We further
demonstrate that MED can identify defect types that are not included in the
training data, such as giant-core defects and defects with higher winding
number. Remarkably, MED can provide correct structural information about $\pm
1$ defects. As such, MED stands poised to transform studies of diverse ordered
systems by providing automated, rapid, accurate, and insightful defect
analysis.

Epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots have been, in the last 40 years or so,
at the center of the research effort of a large community. The focus being on
semiconductor physics and devices, in view of the broad applications and
potential, e.g., for efficient temperature insensitive lasers at telecom
wavelengths, or as artificial atoms for quantum information processing. Our
manuscript aims at addressing, with an historical perspective, the specifics of
(III-V) epitaxial quantum dot early developments (largely for light emitting)
and subsequent years. We will not only highlight the variety of epitaxial
structures and methods, but also, intentionally glancing a didactic approach,
discuss aspects that are, in general, little acknowledged or debated in the
present literature. The analyses will also naturally bring us to examine some
of current challenges, in a field which, despite sensational achievements, is,
remarkably, still far from being mature in its developments and applications.

<br>
<br>
The Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory is the pillar of magnetic quantum
oscillations, which have been extensively applied to characterize a wide range
of metallic states. In this study, we focus on the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)
effect observed in SmSb, a rare-earth monopnictide. We observed a significant
departure from the expected LK theory near $T_N=2.4$~K: both a peak-like
anomaly and an enhancement in the temperature dependence of quantum oscillation
amplitude are seen in SmSb. Moreover, we discovered a remarkable sensitivity of
the SdH amplitudes to sample purity. By adjusting the sample purity, we were
able to tune the temperature dependence of the $\alpha$ band's SdH amplitudes
from a peak-like anomalous behavior to an enhancement. Therefore, SdH
oscillations from the $\alpha$ band connect the two well-known non-LK
behaviours, controllable through varying the sample purity, paving the way for
developing further understanding of the mechanism leading to the anomalous
quantum oscillations.

<br>
<br>
We present results of hard X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
and photoemission diffraction measurements performed on high-quality single
crystals of the valence transition compound EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ for temperatures
25~K $\leq$ T $\leq$ 300~K. At low temperatures we observe a Eu $4f$ valence
$v=2.5$, % occupation number $n=6.5$, which decreases to $v=2.1$ for
temperatures above the valence transition around $T_V \approx 160$~K. The
experimental valence numbers resulting from an evaluation of the Eu(III)/Eu(II)
$3d$ core levels, are used for calculating band structures using density
functional theory. The valence transition significantly changes the band
structure as determined by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In
particular, the Eu $5d$ valence bands are shifted to lower binding energies
with increasing Eu $4f$ occupancy. To a lesser extent, bands derived from the
Si $3p$ and Pd $4d$ orbitals are also affected. This observation suggests a
partial charge transfer between Eu and Pd/Si sites. Comparison with {\it
ab-initio} theory shows a good agreement with experiment, in particular
concerning the unequal band shift with increasing Eu $4f$ occupancy.

<h3>Phase evolution of Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductors under  pressure: a combined DFT+DMFT and effective-model description</h3>

<br>
<br>
In typical Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductors, superconducting (SC)
phases emerge or can be tuned in proximity to the antiferromagnetic (AF)
quantum critical point (QCP), but so far the explicit phase-evolution process
and the coexistence of superconductivity and AF order near the QCP remain lack
of understanding. Here, by combing DFT+DMFT with effective-model calculations,
we provide a theoretical description for Ce-based SC compounds under pressure.
Firstly, DFT+DMFT calculations for the normal states reveal that the Kondo
hybridizations are significantly enhanced, while the initially localized $f$
electrons eventually become fully itinerant via a localized-itinerant
crossover. In this context, we construct an effective model with tunable
parameters under pressure, and show that the interplay of magnetic correlation
and Kondo hybridization can drive successive transitions, from AF phase to
AF+SC coexisting phase, then to paramagnetic SC phase via an AF transition
which corresponds to the QCP, and finally to Kondo paramagnetic phase through a
SC transition driven by localized-itinerant crossover. Our study gives a proper
explanation for the pressure-induced magnetic QCP and SC transition, and for
the phase-evolution process under pressure in typical Ce-based superconductors,
and may also help to understand the SC states emerging around the ferromagnetic
quantum transition points in uranium-based superconductors.

<h3>Emerging Spin-Orbit Torques in Low Dimensional Dirac Materials</h3>

We report a theoretical description of novel spin-orbit torque components
emerging in two-dimensional Dirac materials with broken inversion symmetry. In
contrast to usual metallic interfaces where field-like and damping-like torque
components are competing, we find that an intrinsic damping-like torque which
derives from all Fermi-sea electrons can be simultaneously enhanced along with
the field-like component. Additionally, hitherto overlooked torque components
unique to Dirac materials, emerge from the coupling between spin and pseudospin
degrees of freedom. These torques are found to be resilient to disorder and
could enhance the magnetic switching performance of nearby magnets.

<br>
<br>
Despite several decades of development, microfluidics lacks a sealing
material that can be readily fabricated, leak-tight under high liquid water
pressure, stable over a long time, and vacuum compatible. In this paper, we
report the performances of a micro-scale processable sealing material for
nanofluidic/microfluidics chip fabrication, which enables us to achieve all
these requirements. We observed that micrometric walls made of SU-8
photoresist, whose thickness can be as low as 35 $\mu$m, exhibit water pressure
leak-tightness from 1.5 bar up to 5.5 bar, no water porosity even after 2
months of aging, and are able to sustain under $10^{-5}$ mbar vacuum. This
sealing material is therefore reliable and versatile for building microchips,
part of which must be isolated from liquid water under pressure or vacuum.
Moreover, the fabrication process we propose does not require the use of
aggressive chemicals or high-temperature or high-energy plasma treatment. It
thus opens a new perspective to seal microchips where delicate surfaces such as
nanomaterials are present.

<i>Jalal Smiri, Oguz Umut Salman, Matteo Ghidelli, Ioan R. Ionescu</i>
<br>
<br>
Compression experiments are widely used to study the mechanical properties of
materials at micro- and nanoscale. However, the conventional engineering stress
measurement method used in these experiments neglects to account for the
alterations in the material's shape during loading. This can lead to inaccurate
stress values and potentially misleading conclusions about the material's
mechanical behavior especially in the case of localized deformation. To address
this issue, we present a method for calculating true stress in cases of
localized plastic deformation commonly encountered in experimental settings:
(i) a single band and (ii) two bands oriented in arbitrary directions with
respect to the vertical axis of the pillar (either in the same or opposite
directions). Our simple analytic formulas can be applied to homogeneous and
isotropic materials and crystals, requiring only standard data
(displacement-force curve, aspect ratio, shear band angle and elastic strain
limit) obtained from experimental results and eliminating the need for finite
element computations. Our approach provides a more precise interpretation of
experimental results and can serve as a valuable and simple tool in material
design and characterization.

<br>
<br>
CdTe is the most commercially successful thin-film photovoltaic technology to
date. The recent development of Se-alloyed CdSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ layers in CdTe
solar cells has led to higher device efficiencies, due to a lowered bandgap
improving the photocurrent, improved voltage characteristics and longer carrier
lifetimes. Evidence from cross-sectional electron microscopy is widely believed
to indicate that Se passivates defects in CdSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ solar cells, and
that this is the reason for better lifetimes and voltages in these devices.
Here, we utilise spatially resolved photoluminescence measurements of
CdSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films on glass to study the effects of Se on carrier
recombination in the material, isolated from the impact of conductive
interfaces and without the need to prepare cross-sections through the samples.
We find further evidence to support Se passivation of grain boundaries, but
also identify an associated increase in below-bandgap photoluminescence that
indicates the presence of Se-enhanced luminescent defects. Our results show
that Se treatment, in tandem with Cl passivation, does increase radiative
efficiencies. However, the simultaneous enhancement of defects within the grain
interiors suggests that although it is overall beneficial, Se incorporation may
still ultimately limit the maximum attainable efficiency of
CdSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ solar cells.

<br>
The Edelstein effect is the origin of the spin-orbit torque: a
current-induced torque that is used for the electrical control of ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic materials. This effect originates from the relativistic
spin-orbit coupling, which necessitates utilizing materials with heavy
elements. Here we show that in magnetic materials with non-collinear magnetic
order, the Edelstein effect and consequently also a current-induced torque can
exist even in the absence of the spin-orbit coupling. Using group symmetry
analysis, model calculations, and realistic simulations on selected compounds,
we identify large classes of non-collinear magnet candidates and demonstrate
that the current-driven torque is of similar magnitude as the celebrated
spin-orbit torque in conventional transition metal structures. We also show
that this torque can exist in an insulating material, which could allow for
highly efficient electrical control of magnetic order.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the observation of Skyrmion-like magnetic textures in 2D
itinerant ferromagnets Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$ ($n \geq3$), we develop a microscopic
model combining itinerant magnetism and spin-orbit coupling on a triangular
lattice. The ground state of the model in the absence of magnetic field
consists of filamentary magnetic domain walls revealing a striking similarity
with our magnetic force microscopy experiments on Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. In the
presence of magnetic field, these filaments were found to break into large size
magnetic bubbles in our experiments. We identify uniaxial magnetic anisotropy
as an important parameter in the model that interpolates between magnetic
Skyrmions and ferromagnetic bubbles. Consequently, our work uncovers new
topological magnetic textures that merge properties of Skyrmions and
ferromagnetic bubbles.

Based on statistical mechanics, a macroscopically homogeneous system, i.e., a
single phase in the present context, is composed of many independent
configurations that the system experiences. The macroscopical properties of the
system are determined by the properties and statistical probabilities of those
configurations with respect to external conditions. The volume of a single
phase is thus the weighted sum of the volumes of all configurations.
Consequently, the derivative of the volume to temperature of a single phase
depends on both the derivatives of the volumes of every configuration to
temperature and the derivatives of their statistical probabilities to
temperature with the latter introducing non-linear emergent behaviors. It is
shown that the derivative of the volume to temperature of the single phase can
be negative, i.e., negative thermal expansion (NTE), due to the
symmetry-breaking non-ground-state configurations with smaller volumes than
that of the ground-state configuration and the rapid increase of the
statistical probabilities of the former, and NTE can be predicted without
parameters from the zentropy theory that combines quantum mechanics and
statistical mechanics with the free energy of each configuration predicted from
quantum mechanics and the partition function of each configuration calculated
from its free energy.

Incommensurate heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials, despite

the absence of translation symmetry. Experimental investigations of these

to date no comprehensive theory to simulate and predict a STM image in such
systems. In this paper, we present a new approach to simulate STM images in
arbitrary van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, using a moir{\'e} plane wave
expansion model (MPWEM). Contrary to computationally demanding conventional
methods such as density functional theory that in practice require periodic
boundaries, our method only relies on the description of the noninteracting STM
images of the separate materials, and on a narrow set of intuitive
semi-empirical parameters, successfully simulating experimental STM images down
to angstrom-scale details. We illustrate and benchmark the model using selected
vdW 2D systems composed of structurally and electronically distinct crystals.
The MPWEM, generating reliable STM images within seconds, can serve as an
initial prediction tool, which can prove to be useful in the investigation of
vdW heterostructures, offers an avenue towards fast and reliable prediction
methods in the growing field of twistronics.

Preserving qubit coherence and maintaining high-fidelity qubit control under
complex noise environment is an enduring challenge for scalable quantum
computing. Here we demonstrate an addressable fault-tolerant single spin qubit
with an average control fidelity of 99.12% via randomized benchmarking on a
silicon quantum dot device with an integrated micromagnet. Its dephasing time
T2* is 1.025 us and can be enlarged to 264 us by using the Hahn echo technique,
reflecting strong low-frequency noise in our system. To break through the noise
limitation, we introduce geometric quantum computing to obtain high control
fidelity by exploiting its noise-resilient feature. However, the control
fidelities of the geometric quantum gates are lower than 99%. According to our
simulation, the noise-resilient feature of geometric quantum gates is masked by
the heating effect. With further optimization to alleviate the heating effect,
geometric quantum computing can be a potential approach to reproducibly
achieving high-fidelity qubit control in a complex noise environment.

The unique aspect of the hybrid perovskites is their tunability, allowing to
engineer the bandgap via substitution. From application viewpoint, this allows
creation of the tandem cells between perovskites and silicon, or two or more
perovskites, with associated increase of efficiency beyond single-junction
Schokley-Queisser limit. However, the concentration dependence of optical
bandgap in the hybrid perovskite solid solutions can be non-linear and even
non-monotonic, as determined by the band alignments between endmembers,
presence of the defect states and Urbach tails, and phase separation. Exploring
new compositions brings forth the joint problem of the discovery of the
composition with the desired band gap, and establishing the physical model of
the band gap concentration dependence. Here we report the development of the
experimental workflow based on structured Gaussian Process (sGP) models and
custom sGP (c-sGP) that allow the joint discovery of the experimental behavior
and the underpinning physical model. This approach is verified with simulated
data sets with known ground truth, and was found to accelerate the discovery of
experimental behavior and the underlying physical model. The d/c-sGP approach
utilizes a few calculated thin film bandgap data points to guide targeted
explorations, minimizing the number of thin film preparations. Through
iterative exploration, we demonstrate that the c-sGP algorithm that combined 5
bandgap models converges rapidly, revealing a relationship in the bandgap
diagram of MA1-xGAxPb(I1-xBrx)3. This approach offers a promising method for
efficiently understanding the physical model of band gap concentration
dependence in the binary systems, this method can also be extended to ternary
or higher dimensional systems.

<h3>Emergent Facilitation and Glassy Dynamics in Supercooled Liquids</h3>

In supercooled liquids, dynamical facilitation refers to a phenomenon where
microscopic motion begets further motion nearby, resulting in spatially
heterogeneous dynamics. This is central to the glassy relaxation dynamics of
such liquids, which show super-Arrhenius growth of relaxation timescales with
decreasing temperature. Despite the importance of dynamical facilitation, there
is no theoretical understanding of how facilitation emerges and impacts
relaxation dynamics. Here, we present a theory that explains the microscopic
origins of dynamical facilitation. We show that dynamics proceeds by localized
bond-exchange events, also known as excitations, resulting in the accumulation
of elastic stresses with which new excitations can interact. At low
temperatures, these elastic interactions dominate and facilitate the creation
of new excitations near prior excitations. Using the theory of linear
elasticity and Markov processes, we simulate a model, which reproduces multiple
aspects of glassy dynamics observed in experiments and molecular simulations,
including the stretched exponential decay of relaxation functions, the
super-Arrhenius behavior of relaxation timescales as well as their
two-dimensional (2D) finite-size effects. The model also predicts the
subdiffusive behavior of the mean squared displacement (MSD) on short,
intermediate timescales. Furthermore, we derive the phonon contributions to
diffusion and relaxation, which when combined with the excitation contributions
produce the two-step relaxation processes, and the
ballistic-subdiffusive-diffusive crossover MSD behaviors commonly found in
supercooled liquids.

<h3>Universal relations in flat band superconducting bipartite lattices</h3>

Unconventional flat band (FB) superconductivity, as observed in van der Waals
heterostructures, could open promising avenues towards high-T$_c$ materials.
Indeed, in FBs, pairings and superfluid weight scale linearly with the
interaction parameter, such an unusual behaviour justifies strategies to
promote FB engineering. Bipartite lattices (BLs) which naturally host FBs could
be particularly interesting candidates. By revealing a hidden symmetry of the
quasi-particle eigenstates, we demonstrate that pairings and superfluid weight
obey universal relations in BLs. Remarkably, these general properties are
insensitive to disorder as long as the bipartite character is protected.

We discuss the Goldstone mode of skyrmion crystal in a model of
two-dimenssional ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in magnetic
field. We use stereographic projection approach to construct skyrmion crystal
and consider skyrmion's displacement field. The small overlap of the individual
skyrmion images restricts the potential energy to the interaction of nearest
neighboring displacements. The closed form of the Goldstone mode dispersion is
found and its dependence on the magnetic field is studied. We use semiclassical
quantization to define the Green's function and show that the propagation of
displacements through the crystal changes its tensorial form from isotropic to
anisotropic one at large distances.

<h3>Inverse exciton spin orientation due to trion formation in modulation  doped quantum wells</h3>

Time-resolved and time-integrated circularly polarized photoluminescence of
excitons and trions in external magnetic fields up to 10 T has been studied in
undoped and n-type doped quantum well structures based on ZnSe. In an undoped
structure, a circular polarization of photoluminescence induced by magnetic
fields corresponded to the Boltzmann distribution of excitons on Zeeman
sublevels. The inverse spin orientation of excitons is observed in doped
samples with a carrier density of $3 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ and higher.
Model calculations show that the reason for the inverse spin orientation is the
effective depletion of the lowest-exciton Zeeman sublevel as a result of the
spin-dependent formation of trions. The trion formation time as a result of
exciton-electron binding was determined as 2 ps. This is noticeably shorter
than the characteristic time of the exciton-photon interaction. The observed
effect can be considered as a way of spin manipulation by electric fields.

<h3>Chiral Active Particles are Sensitive Reporter to Environmental Geometry</h3>

<br>
Chiral active particles (CAPs) are self-propelling particles that break
time-reversal symmetry by orbiting or spinning, leading to intriguing
behaviors. Here, we examined the dynamics of CAPs moving in 2D lattices of disk
obstacles through active Brownian dynamics simulations and granular experiments
with grass seeds. We find that the effective diffusivity of the CAPs is
sensitive to the structure of the obstacle lattice, a feature absent in achiral
active particles. We further studied the transport of CAPs in obstacle arrays
under an external field and found a reentrant directional locking effect, which
can be used to sort CAPs with different activities. Finally, we demonstrated
that the parallelogram lattice of obstacles without mirror symmetry can
separate clockwise and counter-clockwise CAPs. The mechanisms of the above
three novel phenomena are qualitatively explained. As such, our work provides a
basis for designing chirality-based tools for single-cell diagnosis and
separation, and active particle-based environmental sensors.

<h3>Casimir-Josephson force on a point contact between two superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>C.W.J. Beenakker</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the elongation or contraction force $F$ on a point contact
(length $L$) connecting two superconductors with a phase difference $\phi$.
When $L$ is small compared to the superconducting coherence length $\xi_0$ this
force is given by $F=-(\Delta_0/\pi\xi_0)\ln(\xi_0/L)\cos\phi$ per
spin-degenerate transverse mode. Quantum fluctuations in states from the
continuous spectrum outside the superconducting gap $\Delta_0$ give the
dominant contribution to this force, which may be understood as the
superconducting counterpart of the electromagnetic Casimir force. We compare
with earlier work that only included contributions from the discrete spectrum
of Andreev levels.

<h3>High-field immiscibility of electrons belonging to adjacent twinned  bismuth crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bulk bismuth has a complex Landau spectrum. The small effective masses and
the large g-factors are anisotropic. Moreover, at a high magnetic field, when
only the lowest Landau levels remain occupied, the chemical potential does not
stay constant. An added complexity arises from the existence of twin
boundaries, which, by producing extra anomalies, further complexify the
interpretation of the data in the extreme quantum limit. Here, we present an
extensive study of low-temperature angle-dependence of magnetoresistance up to
65 T together with measurements of Nernst effect, ultrasound, and
magneto-optics in bismuth. We found that all observed anomalies can be
explained in a single-particle picture of a sample consisting of two twinned
crystals tilted by 108$^{\circ}$. We show that a quantitative agreement between
theory and experiment can be achieved only if one assumes that the two adjacent
twinned crystals keep their own chemical potentials at a high magnetic field,
despite a shift between chemical potentials as large as 68 meV at 65 T. This
implies the existence of an energy barrier between adjacent twinned crystals
reminiscent of a Schottky barrier between a metal and a semiconductor. We argue
that this barrier is built by accumulating charge carriers of opposite signs
across a twin boundary.

<h3>Simulating the Transverse Field Ising Model on the Kagome Lattice using  a Programmable Quantum Annealer</h3>

<br>
<br>
The presence of competing interactions due to geometry leads to frustration
in quantum spin models. As a consequence, the ground state of such systems
often displays a large degeneracy that can be lifted due to thermal or quantum
effects. One such example is the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the Kagome
lattice. It was shown that while the same model on the triangular lattice is
ordered at zero temperature for small transverse field due to an order by
disorder mechanism, the Kagome lattice resists any such effects and exhibits
only short range spin correlations and a trivial paramagnetic phase. We embed
this model on the latest architecture of D-Wave's quantum annealer, the
Advantage2 prototype, which uses the highly connected Zephyr graph. Using
advanced embedding and calibration techniques, we are able to embed a Kagome
lattice with mixed open and periodic boundary conditions of 231 sites on the
full graph of the currently available prototype.Through forward annealing
experiments, we show that under a finite longitudinal field the system exhibits
a one-third magnetization plateau, consistent with a classical spin liquid
state of reduced entropy. An anneal-pause-quench protocol is then used to
extract an experimental ensemble of states resulting from the equilibration of
the model at finite transverse and longitudinal field. This allows us to
construct a partial phase diagram and confirm that the system exits the
constrained Hilbert space of the classical spin liquid when subjected to a
transverse field. We connect our results to previous theoretical results and
quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which helps us confirm the validity of the
quantum simulation realized here, thereby extracting insight into the
performance of the D-Wave quantum annealer to simulate non-trivial quantum
systems in equilibrium.

<h3>A SWAP Gate for Spin Qubits in Silicon</h3>

<br>
With one- and two-qubit gate fidelities approaching the fault-tolerance
threshold for spin qubits in silicon, how to scale up the architecture and make
large arrays of spin qubits become the more pressing challenges. In a scaled-up
structure, qubit-to-qubit connectivity has crucial impact on gate counts of
quantum error correction and general quantum algorithms. In our toolbox of
quantum gates for spin qubits, SWAP gate is quite versatile: it can help solve
the connectivity problem by realizing both short- and long-range spin state
transfer, and act as a basic two-qubit gate, which can reduce quantum circuit
depth when combined with other two-qubit gates. However, for spin qubits in
silicon quantum dots, high fidelity SWAP gates have not been demonstrated due
to the requirements of large circuit bandwidth and a highly adjustable ratio
between the strength of the exchange coupling J and the Zeeman energy
difference Delta E_z. Here we demonstrate a fast SWAP gate with a duration of
~25 ns based on quantum dots in isotopically enriched silicon, with a highly
adjustable ratio between J and Delta E_z, for over two orders of magnitude in
our device. We are also able to calibrate the single-qubit local phases during
the SWAP gate by incorporating single-qubit gates in our circuit. By
independently reading out the qubits, we probe the anti-correlations between
the two spins, estimate the operation fidelity and analyze the dominant error
sources for our SWAP gate. These results pave the way for high fidelity SWAP
gates, and processes based on them, such as quantum communication on chip and
quantum simulation by engineering the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in silicon.

Due to the recent studies of the fracton topological phases, which host
deconfined quasi-particle excitations with mobility restrictions, the concept
of symmetries have been updated. Focusing on one of such new symmetries,
multipole symmetries, including global, dipole, and quadruple symmetries, and
gauge fields associated with them, we construct a new sets of $\mathbb{Z}_N$
$2+1d$ foliated BF theories, where BF theories of conventional topological
phases are stacked in layers with couplings between them. By investigating
gauge invariant non-local operators, we show that our foliated BF theories
exhibit unusual ground state degeneracy depending on the system size; it
depends on the greatest common divisor between $N$ and the system size. Our
result provides a unified insight on UV lattice models of the fracton
topological phases and other unconventional ones in view of foliated field
theories.

<h3>Uncovering anisotropic effects of electric high-moment dipoles on the  tunneling current in $δ$-layer tunnel junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The precise positioning of dopants in semiconductors using scanning tunneling
microscopes has led to the development of planar dopant-based devices, also
known as $\delta$-layers, facilitating the exploration of new concepts in
classical and quantum computing. Recently it have been shown that two distinct
conductivity regimes (low- and high- bias regimes) exist in $\delta$-layer
tunnel junctions due to the presence of quasi-discrete and continuous states in
the conduction band of $\delta$-layer systems. Furthermore, discrete charged
impurities in the tunnel junction region significantly influence the tunneling
rates in $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions. Here we demonstrate that zero-charge
impurities, or electrical dipoles, present in the tunnel junction region can
also significantly alter the tunneling rate, depending, however, on the
specific conductivity regime and orientation and moment of the dipole. In the
low-bias regime with high-resistance tunneling mode dipole impurities of nearly
all orientations and moments can alter the current, indicating the extreme
sensitivity of the tunnel current to the slightest imperfection in the tunnel
gap. In the high-bias regime with low-resistivity only dipole defects with high
moment and orientated in the direction perpendicular to the electron tunneling
direction can significantly affect the current, thus making this conductivity
regime significantly less prone to the influence of dipole defects with
low-moment or dipoles oriented along the propagation direction.

We investigate the scaling of energy cascade in a harmonically trapped,
turbulent, rotating Bose-Einstein condensate in two dimensions. We achieve
turbulence by injecting a localized perturbation into the condensate and
gradually increasing its rotation frequency from an initial value to a maximum.
The main characteristics of the turbulent state depend on the initial
conditions, rotation frequency, and ramp-up time. We analyze the energy and the
fluxes of kinetic energy by considering initial profiles without vortices and
with vortex lattices. In the former case, we find the presence of
Kolmogorov-like scaling ($k^{-5/3}$) of the incompressible kinetic energy in
the inertial range, with a forward cascade of energy at smaller scales for a
high rotation rate. However, in the latter case, the energy spectrum follows
Vinen scaling ($k^{-1}$), with positive fluxes implying a forward cascade of
the energy.

The Dirac spin liquid (DSL) is a two-dimensional (2D) fractionalized Mott
insulator featuring massless Dirac spinon excitations coupled to a compact
$U(1)$ gauge field, which allows for flux-tunneling instanton events described
by magnetic monopoles in (2+1)D Euclidean spacetime. The state-operator
correspondence of conformal field theory has been used recently to define
associated monopole operators and determine their quantum numbers, which encode
the microscopic symmetries of conventional ordered phases proximate to the DSL.
In this work, we utilize semiclassical instanton methods not relying on
conformal invariance to construct monopole operators directly in (2+1)D
spacetime as instanton-induced 't Hooft vertices, i.e.,
fermion-number-violating effective interactions originating from zero modes of
the Euclidean Dirac operator in an instanton background. In the presence of a
flavor-adjoint fermion mass, resummation of the instanton gas is shown to
select the correct monopole to be proliferated, in accordance with predictions
of the state-operator correspondence. We also show that our instanton-based
approach is able to determine monopole quantum numbers on bipartite lattices.

<br>
<br>
The primary challenge in the field of high-temperature superconductivity in
hydrides is to achieve a superconducting state at ambient pressure rather than
the extreme pressures that have been required in experiments so far. Here, we
propose a family of compounds, of composition Mg$_2$XH$_6$ with X$=$Rh, Ir, Pd,
or Pt, that achieves this goal. These materials were identified by scrutinizing
more than a million compounds using a machine-learning accelerated
high-throughput workflow. They are thermodynamically stable, indicating that
they are serious candidates for experimental synthesis. We predict that their
superconducting transition temperatures are in the range of 45-80K, or even
above 100K with appropriate electron doping of the Pt compound. These results
indicate that, although very rare, high-temperature superconductivity in
thermodynamically stable hydrides is achievable at room pressure.

<h3>Non-stationary elastic wave scattering and energy transport in a  one-dimensional harmonic chain with an isotopic defect</h3>

<br>
<br>
The fundamental solution describing non-stationary elastic wave scattering on
an isotopic defect in a one-dimensional harmonic chain is obtained in an
asymptotic form. The chain is subjected to unit impulse point loading applied
to a particle far enough from the defect. The solution is a large time
asymptotics at a moving point of observation, it is in an excellent agreement
with corresponding numerical calculations. At the next step we assume that
applied point impulse excitation has random amplitude. This allows one to model
the heat transport in the chain and across the defect as transport of the
mathematical expectation for the kinetic energy and to use the conception of
the kinetic temperature. To provide simplified continuum description for this
process, we separate the slow in time component of the kinetic temperature.
This quantity can be calculated using asymptotics of the fundamental solution
for the deterministic problem. We demonstrate that there is a thermal shadow
behind the defect: the order of vanishing for the slow temperature is larger
for the particles behind the defect than for the particles between the loading
and the defect. The presence of the thermal shadow is related with a
non-stationary wave phenomenon, which we call the anti-localization of
non-stationary waves. Due to the presence of the shadow, the continuum slow
kinetic temperature has a jump at the defect. Thus, the system under
consideration can be a simple model for the non-stationary phenomenon analogous
to one characterized by the Kapitza thermal resistance. Finally, we
analytically calculate the non-stationary transmission coefficient, which
governs the distortion due to the defect of the slow kinetic temperature
profile at a far zone behind the defect.

One of the hallmark properties of fluids is their shear viscosity which is,
among other things, responsible for parabolic flow profiles through narrow
channels. In recent years, there has been a growing number of observations of
said flow profiles in electronic transport measurements in a variety of
material systems, most notably in graphene. In this paper, we investigate the
shear viscosity of interacting graphene from a theoretical point of view. We
study both a phenomenological as well as a microscopic model and find excellent
agreement between the two. Our main finding is collective modes make a sizeable
contribution to the viscosity that can equal or even outweigh the electronic
contribution that is usually assumed dominant. We comment on how this finding
carries over to systems beyond graphene and related Dirac materials.

<h3>Milestoning estimators of dissipation in systems observed at a coarse  resolution: When ignorance is truly bliss</h3>

<br>
<br>
Many non-equilibrium, active processes are observed at a coarse-grained
level, where different microscopic configurations are projected onto the same
observable state. Such "lumped" observables display memory, and in many cases
the irreversible character of the underlying microscopic dynamics becomes
blurred, e.g., when the projection hides dissipative cycles. As a result, the
observations appear less irreversible, and it is very challenging to infer the
degree of broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we show, contrary to intuition,
that by ignoring parts of the already coarse-grained state space we may -- via
a process called milestoning -- improve entropy-production estimates.
Milestoning systematically renders observations "closer to underlying
microscopic dynamics" and thereby improves thermodynamic inference from lumped
data assuming a given range of memory. Moreover, whereas the correct general
physical definition of time-reversal in the presence of memory remains unknown,
we here show by means of systematic, physically relevant examples that at least
for semi-Markov processes of first and second order, waiting-time contributions
arising from adopting a naive Markovian definition of time-reversal generally
must be discarded.
