<h3>Excitons in periodic potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04902" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04902</a>
<br>

The energy band structure of excitons is studied in periodic potentials
produced by the short-range interaction between the exciton and electrons of
Wigner or Moir\'{e} lattices. Treating the exciton as a point-like dipole that
interacts with the periodic potential, we can solve a simple one-body problem
that provides valuable information on excitons in many-body problem settings.
By employing group theory, we identify the excitonic energy bands that can
couple to light and then quantify their energy shifts in response to a change
in the period of the potential. This approach allows us to emulate the response
of optically active exciton and trion states to a change in electron density.
We gain important insights on the relation between the electron order in a
Wigner crystal and the energy blueshift of the bright exciton. We discuss the
consequences of this relation in the context of optical absorption experiments
in monolayer semiconductors.

<h3>High Pressure and Temperature Neural Network Reactive Force Field for  Energetic Materials</h3>

Reactive force fields for molecular dynamics have enabled a wide range of
studies in numerous material classes. These force fields are computationally
inexpensive as compared to electronic structure calculations and allow for
simulations of millions of atoms. However, the accuracy of traditional force
fields is limited by their functional forms, preventing continual refinement
and improvement. Therefore, we develop a neural network based reactive
interatomic potential for the prediction of the mechanical, thermal, and
chemical response of energetic materials at extreme conditions for energetic
materials. The training set is expanded in an automatic iterative approach and
consists of various CHNO materials and their reactions under ambient and under
shock loading conditions. This new potential shows improved accuracy over the
current state of the art force fields for a wide range of properties such as
detonation performance, decomposition product formation, and vibrational
spectra under ambient and shock loading conditions.

<h3>Traveling Salesman Problem solution using Magnonic Combinatorial Device</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04996</a>

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a decision-making problem that is
essential for a number of practical applications. Today, this problem is solved
on digital computers exploiting Boolean-type architecture by checking one by
one a number of possible routes. In this work, we describe a special type of
hardware for the TSP solution. It is a magnonic combinatorial device comprising
magnetic and electric parts connected in the active ring circuit. There is a
number of possible propagation routes in the magnetic mesh made of phase
shifters, frequency filters, and attenuators. The phase shifters mimic cities
in TSP while the distance between the cities is encoded in the signal
attenuation. The set of frequency filters makes the waves on different
frequencies propagate through the different routes. The principle of operation
is based on the classical wave superposition. There is a number of waves coming
in all possible routes in parallel accumulating different phase shifts and
amplitude damping. However, only the wave(s) that accumulates the certain phase
shift will be amplified by the electric part. The amplification comes first to
the waves that possess the minimum propagation losses. It makes this type of
device suitable for TSP solution, where waves are similar to the salesmen
traveling in all possible routes at a time. We present the results of numerical
modeling illustrating the TSP solutions for four and six cities. Also, we
present experimental data for the TSP solution with four cities.

<h3>Anomalous diffusion, non-Gaussianity, and nonergodicity for subordinated  fractional Brownian motion with a drift</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04872" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04872</a>

<br>
The stochastic motion of a particle with long-range correlated increments
(the moving phase) which is intermittently interrupted by immobilizations (the
traping phase) in a disordered medium is considered in the presence of an
external drift. In particular, we consider trapping events whose times follow a
scale-free distribution with diverging mean trapping time. We construct this
process in terms of fractional Brownian motion (FBM) with constant forcing in
which the trapping effect is introduced by the subordination technique,
connecting "operational time" with observable "real time". We derive the
statistical properties of this process such as non-Gaussianity and
non-ergodicity, for both ensemble and single-trajectory (time) averages. We
demonstrate nice agreement with extensive simulations for the probability
density function, skewness, kurtosis, as well as ensemble and time-averaged
mean squared displacements. We pay specific emphasis on the comparisons between
the cases with and without drift.

<h3>Single monkey-saddle singularity at a two-dimensional Fermi surface and  its instabilities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04877" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04877</a>
<br>
<i>Ömer M. Aksoy, Anirudh Chandrasekaran, Apoorv Tiwari, Titus Neupert, Claudio Chamon, Christopher Mudry</i>
<br>
<br>
Fermi surfaces can undergo sharp transitions under smooth changes of
parameters. Such transitions can have a topological character, as is the case
when a higher-order singularity -- one that requires cubic or higher-order
terms to describe the electronic dispersion near the singularity -- develops at
the transition. When time-reversal and inversion symmetries are present, odd
singularities can only appear in pairs within the Brillouin zone. In this case,
the combination of the enhanced density of states that accompany these
singularities and the nesting between the pairs of singularities leads to
interaction driven instabilities. We present examples of single $n=3$ (monkey
saddle) singularities when time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken.
We then turn to the question of what instabilities are possible when the
singularities are isolated. For spinful electrons, we find that the inclusion
of repulsive interactions destroys any isolated monkey-saddle singularity
present in the noninteracting spectrum by developing Stoner or Lifshitz
instabilities. In contrast, for spinless electrons and at the mean-field level,
we show that an isolated monkey-saddle singularity can be stabilized in the
presence of short-range repulsive interactions.

<h3>Broken unitary picture of dynamics in quantum many-body scars</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04885" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04885</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Quantum many-body scars (QMBSs) are a novel paradigm for the violation of the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis -- Hamiltonians of these systems exhibit
mid-spectrum eigenstates that are equidistant in energy and which possess low
entanglement and evade thermalization for long times. We present a novel
approach for understanding the anomalous dynamical behavior in these systems.
Specifically, we postulate that QMBS Hamiltonians $H$ can generically be
partitioned into a set of terms $O_a$ which do not commute over the entire
Hilbert space, but commute to all orders within the subspace of scar states.
All states in the scar subspace thus evolve according to a `broken unitary'
$U_s(t) = \prod_a e^{-iO_at}$, where $H = \sum_a O_a$; alternatively, the scar
subspace may be viewed as being spawned by common eigenstates of all $O_a$.
While the scar Hamiltonian $H$ may be non-integrable, operators $O_a$ usually
exhibit a trivial spectrum with equidistant eigenergies which gives rise to
revivals at an appropriate period. Two classes of scar models emerge in this
picture -- those with a finite set of $O_a$, as pertaining to, for instance,
scars in the AKLT model, and those with an extensive set of such operators,
such as eta pairing scar states in the Hubbard model. Besides discussing how
well known scar models fit into the above picture, we use this dynamical
decoupling to generalize conditions under which scar subspaces can be
engendered in the two settings, generalizing constraints satisfied by
quasiparticles in the Matrix Product State (MPS) construction of scar
eigenstates, and the Shiraishi-Mori approach. We also discuss connections
between this approach and others in the literature.

<h3>Implementation of Topological Quantum Gates in Magnet-Superconductor  Hybrid Structures</h3>

The creation of topological quantum gates using Majorana zero modes -- an
outstanding problem in the field of topological quantum computing -- relies on
our ability to control the braiding process of these particles in time and
space. Here, we demonstrate the successful implementation of topologically
protected $\sqrt{\sigma_z}$-, $\sigma_z$- and $\sigma_x$-quantum gates using
Majorana zero modes in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid structures.
We propose a braiding protocol that makes use of recent advances in the ability
to control the spin of individual atoms using electron-spin-resonance
techniques. We visualize the braiding process in time and space by computing
the non-equilibrium local density of states, which is proportional to the
time-dependent differential conductance measured in scanning tunneling
spectroscopy experiments.

<h3>A High-Throughput Computational Dataset of Halide Perovskite Alloys</h3>

Novel halide perovskites with improved stability and optoelectronic
properties can be designed via composition engineering at cation and/or anion
sites. Data-driven methods, especially high-throughput first principles
computations and subsequent analysis based on unique materials descriptors, are
key to achieving this goal. In this work, we report a density functional theory
(DFT) based dataset of 495 $ABX_3$ halide perovskite compounds, with various
atomic and molecular species considered at A, B and X sites, and different
amounts of mixing applied at each site using the special quasirandom structures
(SQS) approach for alloys. We perform GGA-PBE calculations on all 495
pseudo-cubic perovskite structures and around 250 calculations using the HSE06
functional, with and without spin-orbit coupling, both including geometry
optimization and static calculations on PBE optimized structures. Lattice
constants, decomposition energy, band gap, and theoretical photovoltaic
efficiency, are computed using each level of theory, and comparisons are made
with collected experimental values. Trends in the data are unraveled in terms
of the effects of mixing at different sites, fractions of specific elemental or
molecular species present in the compound, and averaged physical properties of
species at different sites. We perform screening across the perovskite dataset
based on multiple definitions of tolerance factors, deviation from cubicity,
computed stability and optoelectronic properties, leading to a list of
promising compositions and design principles for achieving multiple desired
properties. Our multi-objective, multi-fidelity, computational halide
perovskite alloy dataset, one of the most comprehensive to date, is available
open-source, and currently being used to train predictive and optimization
models for accelerating the design of novel compositions for superior
optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Four-electron Negative-U Vacancy Defects in Antimony Selenide</h3>

<br>
The phenomenon of negative-U behavior, where a defect traps a second charge
carrier more strongly than the first, has been established in many host
crystals. Here we report the case of four-carrier transitions for both vacancy
defects in Sb2Se3. A global structure searching strategy is employed to explore
the defect energy landscape from first-principles, revealing
previously-unrealized configurations which facilitate a major charge
redistribution. Thermodynamic analysis of the accessible charge states reveals
a four-electron negative-U transition (delta q = 4) for both V_Se and V_Sb and,
by consequence, amphoteric behavior for all intrinsic defects in Sb2Se3, with
impact on its usage in solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, four-electron
negative-U behavior has not been previously explored in this or other
compounds. The unusual behavior is facilitated by valence alternation, a
reconfiguration of the local bonding environments, characteristic of both Se
and Sb.

Accurate and comprehensive material databases extracted from research papers
are critical for materials science and engineering but require significant
human effort to develop. In this paper we present a simple method of extracting
materials data from full texts of research papers suitable for quickly
developing modest-sized databases. The method requires minimal to no coding,
prior knowledge about the extracted property, or model training, and provides
high recall and almost perfect precision in the resultant database. The method
is fully automated except for one human-assisted step, which typically requires
just a few hours of human labor. The method builds on top of natural language
processing and large general language models but can work with almost any such
model. The language models GPT-3/3.5, bart and DeBERTaV3 are evaluated here for
comparison. We provide a detailed detailed analysis of the methods performance
in extracting bulk modulus data, obtaining up to 90% precision at 96% recall,
depending on the amount of human effort involved. We then demonstrate the
methods broader effectiveness by developing a database of critical cooling
rates for metallic glasses.

We show how to incorporate the possibility of kinetic control in the
conceptual Density Functional Theory formalism. This allow us to prove that the
hard/soft acid/base principle will likely fail when the reactions are not
thermodynamically-driven.

<h3>Ultrafast electron-electron scattering in metallic phase of 2H-NbSe$_2$  probed by high harmonic generation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electron-electron scattering on the order of a few to tens of femtoseconds
plays a crucial role in the ultrafast electron dynamics of conventional metals.
When mid-infrared light is used for driving and the period of light field is
comparable to the scattering time in metals, unique light-driven states and
nonlinear optical responses associated with the scattering process are expected
to occur. Here, we use high-harmonics spectroscopy to investigate the effect of
electron-electron scattering on the electron dynamics in thin film 2H-NbSe$_2$
driven by a mid-infrared field. We observed odd-order high harmonics up to 9th
order as well as a broadband emission from hot electrons in the energy range
from 1.5 to 4.0 eV. The electron-electron scattering time in NbSe$_2$ was
estimated from the broadband emission to be almost the same as the period of
the mid-infrared light field. A comparison between experimental results and a
numerical calculation reveals that a kind of resonance between scattering and
driving enhances the non-perturbative behavior of high harmonics in metals,
causing a highly non-equilibrium electronic state corresponding to several
thousand Kelvin.

<h3>Photocarrier Transport of Ferroelectric Photovoltaic Thin Films Detected  by the Magnetic Dynamics of Adjacent Ferromagnetic Layers</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have observed photocarrier transport behaviors in
BiFeO$_3$/La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$~(BFO/LSMO) heterostructures by using
time-resolved synchrotron x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in reflectivity.
The magnetization of LSMO layers was used as a probe of photo-induced carrier
dynamics in the photovoltaic BFO layers. During the photo-induced
demagnetization process, the decay time of LSMO~($x$=0.2) magnetization
strongly depends on the ferroelectric polarization direction of the BFO layer.
The variation of decay time should be attributed to the different sign of
accumulated photocarriers at the BFO/LSMO interface induced by the photovoltaic
effect of the BFO layer. The photocarriers can reach the BFO/LSMO interface and
influence the magnetization distribution in the LSMO layers within the
timescale of $\sim$100~ps. Our results provide a novel strategy to investigate
carrier dynamics and mechanisms of optical control of magnetization in thin
film heterostructures.

<h3>Variant Plateau Law in Atomically Thin Transition Metal Dichalcogenide  Dome Networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
Since its fundamental inception from soap bubbles, Plateau law has sparked
extensive research in equilibrated states. However, most studies primarily
relied on liquids, foams or cellular structures, whereas its applicability has
yet to be explored in nano-scale solid films. Here, we observed a variant
Plateau law in networks of atomically thin domes made of solid two-dimensional
(2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Discrete layer-dependent van der
Waals (vdWs) interaction energies were experimentally and theoretically
obtained for domes protruding in different TMD layers. Significant surface
tension differences from layer-dependent vdWs interaction energies manifest in
a variant of this fundamental law. Meanwhile, the remarkable mechanical
properties, gas impermeability and interlayer vdWs interaction energy of TMD
films enable domes and the networks to sustain high gas pressure and exist in a
fundamentally variant nature for several years. Our findings pave the way
towards exploring variant discretised states with applications in
opto-electro-mechanical devices.

<h3>Thermodynamics of an Empty Box</h3>

<br>
A gas in a box is perhaps the most important model system studied in
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Usually, studies focus on the gas,
whereas the box merely serves as an idealized confinement. The present article
focuses on the box as the central object and develops a thermodynamic theory by
treating the geometric degrees of freedom of the box as the degrees of freedom
of a thermodynamic system. Applying standard mathematical methods to the
thermodynamics of an empty box allows equations with the same structure as
those of cosmology and classical and quantum mechanics to be derived. The
simple model system of an empty box is shown to have interesting connections to
classical mechanics, special relativity, and quantum field theory.

<h3>Kirigami-Inspired Thermal Regulator</h3>

<br>
<br>
One of the current challenges in nanoscience is tailoring phononic devices,
such as thermal regulators and thermal computing. This has long been a rather
elusive task because the thermal-switching ratio is not as high as electronic
analogs. Mapping from a topological kirigami assembly, nitrogen-doped porous
graphene metamaterials on the nanoscale are inversely designed with a
thermal-switching ratio of 27.79, which is more than double the value of
previous work. We trace this behavior to the chiral folding-unfolding
deformation, resulting in a metal-insulator transition. This study provides a
nanomaterial design paradigm to bridge the gap between kinematics and
functional metamaterials that motivates the development of high-performance
thermal regulators.

<h3>Chiral Fibonacci spin liquid in a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05060" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05060</a>

<br>
<br>
We study a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with nearest
neighbor interactions. Based on matrix product state simulations and symmetry
considerations, we find evidence that, with ferromagnetic isotropic couplings,
the model realizes a chiral Fibonacci spin liquid, characterized by the
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion topological order. This is supported by simulations
on both cylinder and strip geometries. On infinitely long cylinders with
various widths, scaling analysis of entanglement entropy and maximal
correlation length suggests that the model has a gapped 2D bulk. The
topological entanglement entropy is extracted and found to be in agreement with
the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion topological order. On infinitely long strips
with moderate widths, we find the model is critical with a central charge
consistent with the chiral edge theory of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion
topological phase. We conclude by commenting on an experimental realization of
this model in Rydberg atom arrays.

<h3>Signatures of Chiral Superconductivity in Chiral Molecule Intercalated  Tantalum Disulfide</h3>

Chiral superconductors, a unique class of unconventional superconductors in
which the complex superconducting order parameter winds clockwise or
counter-clockwise in the momentum space, represent a topologically non-trivial
system with direct implications for topological quantum computing. Intrinsic
chiral superconductors are extremely rare, with only a few arguable examples
including heavy fermion metals (UTe$_2$, UPt$_3$) and perovskite superconductor
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Chiral molecules with neither mirror nor inversion symmetry have
been widely investigated, in which the spin degeneracy may be lifted by the
molecular chirality. Thus, a combination of superconductivity with chiral
molecules may lead to a spin-polarized ground state for realizing chiral
superconductivity. Herein we report the first investigation of unconventional
superconductivity in chiral molecule intercalated tantalum disulfide (TaS$_2$)
and reveal key signatures of chiral superconductivity. Little-Parks
measurements demonstrate a robust and reproducible half-flux quantum phase
shift in both left- and right-handed chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$,
which is absent in pristine TaS$_2$ or achiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$,
highlighting the essential role of molecular chirality in inducing
unconventional superconductivity. The robust half-flux quantum phase shift
demonstrates unconventional superconductivity and constitutes strong evidence
supporting a chiral superconducting ordering parameter. Critical current
measurements at lower temperature reveal a peculiar asymmetric phase shift
under opposite supercurrent, with a relative phase difference approaching the
unity of {\pi} at below 0.5 K, further supporting topologically non-trivial
superconductivity. Our study signifies the potential of hybrid superlattices
with intriguing coupling between the crystalline atomic layers and the
self-assembled molecular layers.

<h3>Intermediate-range order governs dynamics in dense colloidal liquids</h3>

The conventional wisdom is that liquids are completely disordered and lack
non-trivial structure beyond nearest-neighbor distances. Recent observations
have upended this view and demonstrated that the microstructure in liquids is
surprisingly rich and plays a critical role in numerous physical, biological,
and industrial processes. However, approaches to uncover this structure are
either system-specific or yield results that are not physically intuitive.
Here, through single-particle resolved three-dimensional confocal microscope
imaging and the use of a recently introduced four-point correlation function,
we show that bidisperse colloidal liquids have a highly non-trivial structure
comprising alternating layers with icosahedral and dodecahedral order, which
extends well-beyond nearest-neighbor distances and grows with supercooling. By
quantifying the dynamics of the system on the particle level, we establish that
it is this intermediate-range order, and not the short-range order, which has a
one-to-one correlation with dynamical heterogeneities, a property directly
related to the relaxation dynamics of glassy liquids. Our experimental findings
provide a direct and much sought-after link between the structure and dynamics
of liquids and pave the way for probing the consequences of this
intermediate-range order in other liquid state processes.

The maximal speed $v^\ast$ for magnetic flux quanta is determined by the
energy relaxation of unpaired electrons and is thus essential for
superconducting microstrip single-photon detectors (SMSPDs). However, the
deduction of $v^\ast$ from the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) curves at zero
magnetic field is hindered by the unknown number of vortices, $n_\mathrm{v}$,
as a small number of fast-moving vortices can induce the same voltage as a
large number of slow-moving ones. Here, we introduce an approach for the
quantitative determination of $n_\mathrm{v}$ and $v^\ast$. The idea is based on
the Aslamazov and Larkin prediction of kinks in the $I$-$V$ curves of wide and
short superconducting constrictions when the number of fluxons crossing the
constriction is increased by one. We realize such conditions in wide MoSi thin
strips with slits milled by a focused ion beam and reveal quantum effects in a
macroscopic system. By observing kinks in the $I$-$V$ curves with increase of
the transport current, we evidence a crossover from a single- to multi-fluxon
dynamics and deduce $v^\ast\simeq12\,$km/s. Our experimental observations are
augmented with numerical modeling results which reveal a transition from a
vortex chain over a vortex jet to a vortex river with increase of
$n_\mathrm{v}$ and the vortex velocity. Our findings are essential for the
development of 1D and 2D few-fluxon devices and provide a demanded approach for
the deduction of $v^\ast$ at the SMSPD operation conditions.

<br>
In a two-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, we demonstrate the
Rashba spin-orbit coupling can introduce the dynamical instability to four
different zero quasimomentum states, even though, the existence of which does
not depend on the spin-orbit coupling. We further show that the dynamical
instability triggers patterning processes for all four states. The features of
formed patterns are identified from the symmetries of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
Hamiltonian. Finally, we reveal that an anisotropic spin-orbit coupling can
also generate the dynamical instability to all four states and can arise
patterning processes.

Electronic nematicity has been commonly observed in juxtaposition with
unconventional superconductivity. Understanding the nature of the nematic
state, as well as its consequence on the electronic band structure and
superconductivity, has become a pivotal focus in condensed matter physics. Here
we use spectroscopic imaging-scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize how the
interacting quasiparticles organize themselves in the nematic state of kagome
superconductor CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$, in which twofold symmetric (C$_2$)
quasiparticle scattering interference of the vanadium kagome bands emerges
below the bulk nematic transition temperature (T$_{nem}$). Surprisingly, we
find that the coupling to collective modes, i.e., the phonon, dramatically
alters the electrons self-energy and renormalizes the Fermi velocity of the
in-plane vanadium d$_{xy/x^2-y^2}$ bands only along the C$_2$ direction, making
the low-energy dispersion and electron dynamics highly nonequivalent along the
three lattice directions. The anti-correlation between T$_{nem}$ and the
superconducting transition temperature upon Ti substitution further suggests a
possible competition between superconductivity and electron nematicity in this
series, with a principal superconducting gap opening on the same V bands once
the nematic state is totally suppressed. The organizing principle of these
quasiparticles provides essential information for understanding the interplay
between charge density wave and superconductivity in these kagome
superconductors, and also reveals a previously unexplored form that expands the
landscape for modelling electronic nematicity in systems where electron
correlations and lattice degree of freedom act in concert.

Non-Hermitian descriptions often model open or driven systems away from the
equilibrium. Nonetheless, in equilibrium electronic systems, a non-Hermitian
nature of an effective Hamiltonian manifests itself as unconventional
observables such as a bulk Fermi arc and skin effects. We theoretically reveal
that spin-dependent quasipaticle lifetimes, which signify the non-Hermiticity
of a model, induce the anomalous Hall effect, namely the Hall effect without an
external magnetic field. We first examine the effect of nonmagnetic and
magnetic impurities and obtain a non-Hermitian effective model. Then, we
calculate the Kubo formula from the microscopic model to ascertain a
non-Hermitian interpretation of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities. Our
results elucidate the vital role of the non-Hermitian equilibrium nature in the
quantum transport phenomena.

Hybrid materials combining an organic matrix and high-Z nanomaterials show
potential for applications in radiation detection, allowing unprecedented
device architectures and functionality. Herein, novel hybrid organic-inorganic
systems were produced using a mixture of tungstate (CaWO$_4$ or ZnWO$_4$)
nanoparticles with a P3HT:PCBM blend. The nano-tungstates with a crystallite
size of 43 nm for CaWO$_4$ and 30 nm for ZnWO$_4$ were synthesized by the
hydrothermal method. Their structure and morphology were characterized by X-ray
diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The hybrid systems were used to
fabricate direct conversion X-ray detectors able to operate with zero bias
voltage. The detector performance was tested in a wide energy range using
monochromatic synchrotron radiation. The addition of nanoparticles with high-Z
elements improved the detector response to X-ray radiation compared with that
of a pure organic P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction cell. The high dynamic range of
our detector allows for recording X-ray absorption spectra, including the fine
X-ray absorption structure located beyond the absorption edge. The obtained
results suggest that nanocrystalline tungstates are promising candidates for
application in direct organic-inorganic X-ray detectors.

<br>
<br>
Coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism, though a very few
systems show this, is one of the exciting properties of a solid from the
fundamental science point of view. Here, we report on the discovery of
superconductivity in the van der Waals ferromagnetic Cr$_3$Te$_4$ that is
coexisted with ferromagnetism, induced by the Sn intercalation
(Sn$_{0.06}$Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$), below a transition temperature of $T_c$=3.5 K. In
addition, despite the magnetism and Meissner effects are anisotropic, the
superconductivity observed from the in-plane electrical resistivity
($\rho_{\it{bc}}$) is nearly isotropic between $H\parallel \it{bc}$ and
$H\parallel \it{a}$, suggesting separate channels of conduction electrons
responsible for the superconductivity and ferromagnetism of this system which
is supported by our spin-resolved DFT calculations. We identify two orders
increase in the carrier density of Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$ by Sn intercalation compared
to the parent Cr$_3$Te$_4$. We think, the enhanced carrier density could be
playing a key role for the discovered superconductivity in ferromagnetic
Sn$_{0.06}$Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$. We also explored other mechanisms such as the Fermi
surface nesting to understand microscopically the superconductivity of this
system.

<br>
The appearance of intrinsic ferromagnetism in 2D materials opens the
possibility of investigating the interplay between magnetism and topology. The
magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) describing the easy axis for magnetization in
a particular direction is an important yardstick for nanoscale applications.
Here, the first-principles approach is used to investigate the electronic band
structures, the strain dependence of MAE in pristine VSi2Z4 (Z=P, As) and its
Janus phase VSiGeP2As2 and the evolution of the topology as a function of the
Coulomb interaction. In the Janus phase the compound presents a breaking of the
mirror symmetry, which is equivalent to having an electric field, and the
system can be piezoelectric. It is revealed that all three monolayers exhibit
ferromagnetic ground state ordering, which is robust even under biaxial
strains. A large value of coupling J is obtained, and this, together with the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, will produce a large critical temperature. We
found an out-of-plane (in-plane) magnetization for VSi2P4 (VSi2As4), while
in-plane magnetization for VSiGeP2As2. Furthermore, we observed a
correlation-driven topological transition in the Janus VSiGeP2As2. Our analysis
of these emerging pristine and Janus-phased magnetic semiconductors opens
prospects for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology in
two-dimensional materials.

<h3>The energy cost of local rearrangements, not cooperative effects, makes  glasses solid</h3>

<br>
<br>
Which phenomenon slows down the dynamics in super-cooled liquids and turns
them into glasses is a long-standing question of condensed-matter. Most popular
theories posit that the dynamics becomes cooperative as the temperature
decreases: many events must occur in a coordinated fashion on a growing length
scale for relaxation to occur. Instead, other approaches consider that local
barriers associated with the elementary rearrangement of a few particles or
`excitations' govern the dynamics. Here we resolve this conundrum by
introducing a new algorithm, SEER, that can systematically extract hundreds of
excitations and their energy from any given configuration. Remarkably, we find
at low temperatures that the excitation density of states is essentially
shifted to higher energy under cooling. This observation directly predicts how
local barriers slow down the dynamics, assuming no cooperative effects. We test
this prediction in numerical super-cooled liquids using swap algorithms,
allowing us to measure the relaxation time up to milliseconds. The agreement is
quantitative, revealing that cooperative effects are absent and leading to new
perspectives on the glass transition.

<br>
<br>
The diverging relaxation time in approaching hypothetical ideal glass
transition is a subject of hot debate. In the current paper we demonstrate, how
diverging relaxation time and turning excess entropy to zero (which is an
essence of Kauzmann's paradox) can be avoided, using as an example the model
molecular glassformer, propylene carbonate. For this purpose we compare its
thermodynamic and dielectric relaxation properties, both known from the
literature. The agreement between two sets of data can be achieved, if we
suppose, that enthalpy of supercooled liquid propylene carbonate is governed by
activation law, and relaxation time follows double exponential law. We propose
the generalized Adam-Gibbs law to reconcile this two dependencies, and
qualitatively discuss its implications.

<h3>Generalized method of image dyons for quasi-two dimensional slabs with  ordinary-topological insulator interfaces</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electrostatic charges near the interface bewteen topological (TI) and
ordinary (OI) insulators induce magnetic fields in the medium that can be
described through the so-called method of image dyons (electric charge -
magnetic monopole pairs), the magnetoelectric extension of the method of image
charges in classical electrostatics. Here, we provide the expressions for the
image dyons and ensuing magnetoelectric potentials in a system comprised by two
planar-parallel OI-TI interfaces conforming a finite-width slab. The obtained
formulae extend earlier work in that they account for all different
combinations of materials forming the slab and its surroundings, including
asymmetric systems, as well as all possible combinations of external
magnetization orientations on the interfaces. The equations are susceptible of
implementation in simple computational codes, to be solved recurrently, in
order to model magnetoelectric fields in topological quantum wells, thin films,
or layers of two-dimensional materials. We exemplify this by calculating the
magnetic fields induced by a point charge in nanometer-thick quantum wells, by
means of a Mathematica code made available in repositories.

<h3>Non-Fermi liquid behavior of doped Kondo insulator: The unique  properties of CeRhSb$_{1-x}$Te$_x$</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
It follows from our analysis of CeRhSb that the formation of Kondo insulator
state due to the presence of the collective spin singlet state is strongly
reduced by its doping with various dopants when their amount exceeds 8--10\%,
regardless of whether they are substituted for Ce, Rh or Sb. A wide variety of
experimental results (electrical resistivity $\rho$, magnetic susceptibility
$\chi$, specific heat $C$, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and theoretical
investigations have convincingly demonstrated the proposed earlier scaling law
$\chi\times\rho=const.$ in the Kondo insulator regime, which is universal for
all known Kondo insulators. We also analyze the properties of the
Griffiths--phase for CeRhSb when Pd substitutes Rh, or Sb is fractionally
replaced by Te and Sn, whereas doping of Ce with La leads to the formation of
magnetic cluster structure as a result of the Kondo hole effect.
Magnetoresistance of CeRhSb and CeRhSb$_{0.98}$Te$_{0.02}$ as a function of the
field $B$ shows a $-B^2$ behavior, which provides evidence for the
topologically nontrivial nature of these compounds, as was previously predicted
theoretically for CeRhSb on the basis on the band structure calculations.

Spontaneously broken symmetry in the ground state of Bi-based topological
materials can lead to promising Topological superconductors, such as Cu-Bi2Se3,
Sr-Bi2Se3 and Nb-Bi2Se3. In recent studies, coexistence of multiple Fermi
surface features and superconductivity was found in Nb-Bi2Se3. However, the
resultant mutliple Fermi surface--charge density wave has not been
experimentally reported yet. In this paper, we report possible evidence of
co-occurence of a charge density wave (CDW) ground state and a superconducting
(SC) ground state in Nb intercalated Bi2Se3. An intercalation induced Periodic
Lattice Distortion appears to help stabilize the CDW state, possibly assisting
in the formation of 1D chains and rendering electronic and phonon anisotropy to
this intriguing system.

We report on the structural, electric and magnetic properties of
$(\mathrm{Ni}_x\mathrm{Co}_{1-x})\mathrm{B}$ ferromagnetic nanotubes,
displaying azimuthal magnetization. The tubes are fabricated using electroless
plating in polycarbonate porous templates, with lengths several tens of
micrometers, diameters from 100nm to 500nm and wall thicknesses from 10nm to
80nm. The resistivity is $\sim 1.5\times10^{-6}\mathrm{\Omega/m}$, and the
anisotropic magnetoresistance~(AMR) of 0.2-0.3%, one order of magnitude
larger~(resp. smaller) than in the bulk material, which we attribute to the
resistance at grain boundaries. We determined the azimuthal anisotropy field
from M(H) AMR loops of single tubes contacted electrically. Its magnitude is
around 10mT, and tends to increase with the tube wall thickness, as well as the
Co content. However, surprisingly it does not dependent much on the diameter
nor on the curvature.

<br>
With the motivation of searching high-temperature superconductivity in
hydrides, numerously hydrogen-dominated superconductors have been predicted
theoretically and some of them have been also synthesized experimentally at an
ultrahigh pressure about several hundred GPa, which is too high to be used in
practical application. To address this issue, we report a new lead hydride,
defined as binary metal-bonded perovskite $\rm Pb_4H$, featured with better
ductility than the widely investigated multi-hydrogen, iron-based and cuprate
superconductors. Structural stability of $\rm Pb_4H$ has been carefully
verified. The $\rm Pb_4H$ presents high critical temperature up to 46 K at
ambient pressure, approximately six times larger than that of bulk Pb, by means
of advanced Migdal-Eliashberg theory. Moreover, the electron-phonon coupling
strength of $\rm Pb_4H$ has an enhancement of 58% than that of bulk Pb because
the hydrogen implantation in bulk Pb can induce several new high-frequency
optical phonon branches strongly coupled with electrons on Fermi surface,
heightening the superconductivity. Furthermore, $\rm Pb_4H$ is a
phonon-mediated two-band superconductor, similar to metal lead.

We study dynamics of spins in the presence of a feedback magnetic field. The
inhomogeneity of the bias magnetic field results in that of the Larmor
frequencies of the spins. We find that the system exhibits rich nonlinear
dynamics: beyond limit cycles which have been the focus of previous studies,
quasi-periodic orbits and chaos emerge in a wide parameter space. The stable
regions of each phases are determined analytically or numerically. We establish
the relation between the synchronization frequency of limit cycles and the
field inhomogeneity. Our results have important implications to precision
measurement.

<br>
Emergent grain boundaries at free surface control material properties such as
nanomaterial strength, catalysis, and corrosion. Recently the restructuring of
emergent boundaries on copper (111) surfaces was discovered experimentally and
atomic calculations point to its universality in fcc metal systems.
Restructuring is due to a preference for boundaries to shift their tilt axis
across the (1-10) plane towards [112] and ultimately to form low energy [112]
core shifted boundaries (CSBs). However, the observed geometry of these
emergent boundaries is not reproduced by atomic calculations and the driving
force is still controversial due to inconsistencies between the computational
continuum analysis and atomic calculations. Here, using atomic calculations
that involve a methodical shift of the dislocation core, we confirmed the core
shift of emergent boundaries observed in experiment and reconciled the atomic
calculations with the elastic analysis through the inclusion of a straight
wedge disclination at the free surface.

We demonstrate the laser-induced control over spin-wave (SW) transport in the
magnonic crystal (MC) waveguide formed from the semiconductor slab placed on
the ferrite film. We considered bilayer MC with periodical grooves performed on
the top of the n-type gallium arsenide slab side that oriented to the yttrium
iron garnet film. To observe the appearance of magnonic gap induced by laser
radiation, the fabricated structure was studied by the use of microwave
spectroscopy and Brillouin light-scattering. We perform detailed numerical
studies of this structure. We showed that the optical control of the magnonic
gaps (frequency width and position) is related to the variation of the charge
carriers' concentration in GaAs. We attribute these to nonreciprocity of SW
transport in the layered structure. Nonreciprocity was induced by the laser
exposure of the GaAs slab due to SWs' induced electromagnetic field screening
by the optically-generated charge carriers. We showed that SW dispersion,
nonreciprocity, and magnonic band gap position and width in the
ferrite-semiconductor magnonic crystal can be modified in a controlled manner
by laser radiation. Our results show the possibility of the integration of
magnonics and semiconductor electronics on the base of YIG/GaAs structures.

The critical Kauffman model with connectivity one is the simplest class of
critical Boolean networks. Nevertheless, it exhibits intricate behavior at the
boundary of order and chaos. We prove that the number of attractors is at least
$2^{m - o(m)}$, where $m$ is the number of nodes in loops - considerably larger
than previously believed. We also find the mean attractor length is at most
$2^{o(m)}$, the first proof that it is sub-exponential in $m$.

Chemical reactions are usually studied under the assumption that both
substrates and catalysts are well mixed (WM) throughout the system. Although
this is often applicable to test-tube experimental conditions, it is not
realistic in cellular environments, where biomolecules can undergo
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form condensates, leading to
important functional outcomes, including the modulation of catalytic action.
Similar processes may also play a role in protocellular systems, like primitive
coacervates, or in membrane-assisted prebiotic pathways. Here we explore
whether the de-mixing of catalysts could lead to the formation of
micro-environments that influence the kinetics of a linear (multi-step)
reaction pathway, as compared to a WM system. We implemented a general lattice
model to simulate LLPS of an ensemble of different catalysts and extended it to
include diffusion and a sequence of reactions of small substrates. We carried
out a quantitative analysis of how the phase separation of the catalysts
affects reaction times depending on the affinity between substrates and
catalysts, the length of the reaction pathway, the system size, and the degree
of homogeneity of the condensate. A key aspect underlying the differences
reported between the two scenarios is that the scale invariance observed in the
WM system is broken by condensation processes. The main theoretical
implications of our results for mean-field chemistry are drawn, extending the
mass action kinetics scheme to include substrate initial hitting times to reach
the catalysts condensate. We finally test this approach by considering open
non-linear conditions, where we successfully predict, through microscopic
simulations, that phase separation inhibits chemical oscillatory behaviour,
providing a possible explanation for the marginal role that this complex
dynamic behaviour plays in real metabolisms.

Prediction of high-$T_{\rm{c}}$ superconductivity in hole-doped Li$_x$BC two
decades ago has brought about an extensive effort to synthesize new materials
with honeycomb B-C layers, but the thermodynamic stability of Li-B-C compounds
remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use density functional theory to
characterize well-established and recently reported Li-B-C phases. Our
calculation of the Li chemical potential in Li$_x$BC helps estimate the
($T$,$P$) conditions required for delithiation of the LiBC parent material,
while examination of B-C phases helps rationalize the observation of metastable
BC$_3$ polymorphs with honeycomb and diamond-like morphologies. At the same
time, we demonstrate that recently reported BC$_3$, LiBC$_3$, and Li$_2$B$_2$C
phases with new crystal structures are both dynamically and thermodynamically
unstable. With a combination of evolutionary optimization and rational design,
we identify considerably more natural and favorable Li$_2$B$_2$C configurations
that, nevertheless, remain above the thermodynamic stability threshold.

an indirect bandgap of 2.07 eV, which is supported by the density functional
theory calculated band structure. The nanosheets do not show detectable
photoluminescence at room temperature at band-edge excitation which is
attributed to the indirect bandgap. However, cathodoluminescence spanning a
broad range from 500 nm to 750 nm with an asymmetric and Stokes-shifted
spectrum is observed, indicating the phonon- and trap-assisted recombination.
We study the ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets using a
femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The samples are excited with
pump energies higher than their bandgap, and the results are interpreted in
terms of hot carrier generation (<1 ps), thermalization with local phonons (~1
ps), and cooling (>30 ps). Further, a relatively slow relaxation of excitons
(>3 ns) at the band edge suggests the formation of stable polarons which decay
nonradiatively by emitting phonons.

Soft-granular media such as dense emulsions, foams or tissues tend to exhibit
either fluid- or solid-like properties depending on the applied stresses.
However, the internal dynamics of soft granular systems bound by closed
interfaces is poorly understood, while it remains of significant interest in
diverse fields ranging from material science (porous materials) and tissue
engineering (granular bioinks) to developmental biology (embryos, organoids)
and medicine (circulating tumor cell clusters). Here, we report the spontaneous
occurrence of crystalline-like hexagonal structures within soft granular
clusters which self-organize under external flow. We use a densely packed
double emulsion as a model soft granular material to produce clusters of sizes
of 20-40 grains (droplets). We find that, optimally, the crystallites emerge
under weak flows, when the internal shear stresses slightly agitate the system
allowing internal rearrangements. Excessive flows destroy the delicate
crystalline structure and lead to constant internal recirculations, i.e.,
effective fluidization of the granular medium. Upon subjecting the clusters to
cycles of constriction and relaxation/expansion, we also find differences
between the behaviours of two groups of droplets: those within the inner part
of the cluster and those at its rim, with the latter subjected to larger
deformations and less frequent rearrangements, effectively acting as an elastic
solid-like membrane around the inner fluid-like core. This structural-dynamical
heterogeneity appears to be of purely topological origin and as such we expect
it to remain universal in various types of soft granular clusters or jets
including also cell aggregates, organoids or bioprinted tissues.

First-principles simulations of electronic properties of hybrid
inorganic/organic interfaces are challenging, as common density-functional
theory (DFT) approximations target specific material classes like bulk
semiconductors or gas-phase molecules. Taking as a prototypical example
anthracene physisorbed on monolayer MoS$_2$, we assess the ability of different
\textit{ab initio} schemes to describe the electronic structure using
semi-local and hybrid DFT. For the latter, an unconstrained three-parameter
range-separation scheme is employed. Comparisons against many-body perturbation
theory results indicate that DFT is substantially unable to make reliable
predictions about interfacial properties. Hybrid functionals, while improving
the accuracy of the MoS$_2$ band structure, do not systematically enhance the
description of hybrid systems with respect to semi-local functionals. Neither
approach provides a good starting point for $G_0W_0$, which, consequently,
cannot provide much information beyond the correct energy level alignment. We
show that non-empirically parametrized electrostatic screening models can
accomplish the same task at negligible computational costs. Such schemes can
include substrates of hybrid interfaces in good agreement with experimental
data. Our results indicate that currently, fully atomistic, many-body
simulations of weakly interacting hybrid systems are not worth the required
computational resources. In contrast, ab-initio-parametrized effective models
mimicking the environment offer a scalable alternative without compromising
accuracy and predictivity.

The lack of dense random access memory is one of the main bottlenecks for the
creation of a digital superconducting computer. In this work we study
experimentally vortex-based superconducting memory cells. Three main results
are obtained. First, we test scalability and demonstrate that the cells can be
straightforwardly miniaturized to submicron sizes. Second, we emphasize the
importance of conscious geometrical engineering. In the studied devices we
introduce an asymmetric easy track for vortex motion and show that it enables a
controllable manipulation of vortex states. Finally, we perform a detailed
analysis of word and bit line operation of a 1x1 {\mu}m2 cell. High-endurance,
nonvolatile operation at zero magnetic field is reported. Remarkably, we
observe that the combined word and bit line threshold current is significantly
reduced compared to the bare word-line operation. This could greatly improve
the selectivity of individual cell addressing in a multibit RAM. The achieved
one square micron area is an important milestone and a significant step forward
towards creation of a dense cryogenic memory.

<h3>Assessing the source of error in local orbital-free density functionals</h3>

We investigate the source of error in local orbital-free density functionals
relative to Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). In particular, through
numerical studies on a range of materials, for a variety of crystal structures
subject to strain and atomic displacements, we find that while the ground state
electron density in Thomas-Fermi-von Weizs\"acker (TFW) orbital-free DFT is
close to the Kohn-Sham density, the corresponding energy deviates significantly
from the Kohn-Sham value. We show that these differences are a consequence of
the poor representation of the linear response susceptibility within the TFW
approximation for the electronic kinetic energy, confirming conjectures in the
literature. In so doing, we find that the energy computed from a
non-self-consistent Kohn-Sham calculation using the TFW electronic ground state
density is in very good agreement with that obtained from the fully
self-consistent Kohn-Sham solution.

<h3>Frequency-dependent Faraday and Kerr rotation in anisotropic  nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals in a magnetic field</h3>

We calculate the frequency-dependent longitudinal and Hall conductivities and
the Faraday and Kerr rotation angles for a single sheet of anisotropic Dirac
semimetal protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry in the presence of a
perpendicular magnetic field. While the magnetic field causes a rotation of the
plane of polarization of the light, the anisotropy causes the appearance of an
elliptically polarized component in an initially linearly polarized beam. The
two effects can be combined in a single complex Faraday rotation angle. At the
zero-frequency limit, we find a finite value of the Faraday rotation angle,
which is given by $2\alpha_F$, where $\alpha_F$ is the effective fine structure
constant associated with the velocity of the linearly dispersing Dirac
fermions. We also find a logarithmic enhancement of the Faraday (and Kerr)
rotation angles as the frequency of the light approaches the absorption edge
associated with the magnetic field-induced gap. While the enhancement is
reduced by impurity scattering, it remains significant for an attainable level
of material purity. These results indicate that two-dimensional Dirac materials
protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry are responsive to weak magnetic fields and
can be used as platforms for magneto-optic applications, such as the
realization of polarization-rotating devices.

We determine the full distribution and moments of the first passage time for
a wide class of stochastic search processes in the limit of frequent stochastic
resetting. Our results apply to any system whose short-time behavior of the
search process without resetting can be estimated. We illustrate these results
in several examples and show that the errors of our approximations vanish
exponentially fast in typical scenarios of diffusive search.

Free-space time domain THz spectroscopy accesses electrodynamic responses in
a frequency regime ideally matched to interacting condensed matter systems.
However, THz spectroscopy is challenging when samples are physically smaller
than the diffraction limit of ~0.5 mm, as is typical, for example, in van der
Waals materials and heterostructures. Here, we present an on-chip, time-domain
THz spectrometer based on semiconducting photoconductive switches with a
bandwidth of 200 GHz to 750 GHz. We measure the optical conductivity of a
7.5-$\mu$m wide NbN film across the superconducting transition, demonstrating
spectroscopic signatures of the superconducting gap in a sample smaller than 2%
of the Rayleigh diffraction limit. Our spectrometer features an interchangeable
sample architecture, making it ideal for probing superconductivity, magnetism,
and charge order in strongly correlated van der Waals materials.
