<h3>Fractal Nodal Band Structures and Fermi Surfaces</h3>

Non-Hermitian systems exhibit very interesting band structures, comprising
exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. Novel
topological phenomena were shown to arise from the existence of those
exceptional points, with applications in lasing and sensing. One important open
question is how the topology of those exceptional points would manifest at
non-integer dimension. Here, we report on the appearance of fractal eigenvalue
degeneracies in Hermitian and non-Hermitian topological band structures. The
existence of a fractal nodal Fermi surface might have profound implications on
the physics of black holes and Fermi surface instability driven phenomena, such
as superconductivity and charge density waves.

<h3>Short-range interactions are irrelevant at the quasiperiodic-driven  Luttinger Liquid to Anderson Glass transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09197" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09197</a>

We show that short-range interactions are irrelevant around gapless
ground-state delocalization-localization transitions driven by quasiperiodicity
in interacting fermionic chains. In the presence of interactions, these
transitions separate Luttinger Liquid and Anderson glass phases. Remarkably,
close to criticality, we find that excitations become effectively
non-interacting. By formulating a many-body generalization of a recently
developed method to obtain single-particle localization phase diagrams, we
carry out precise calculations of critical points between Luttinger Liquid and
Anderson glass phases and find that the correlation length critical exponent
takes the value $\nu = 1.001 \pm 0.007$, compatible with $\nu=1$ known exactly
at the non-interacting critical point. We also show that other critical
exponents, such as the dynamical exponent $z$ and a many-body analog of the
fractal dimension are compatible with the exponents obtained at the
non-interacting critical point. Noteworthy, we find that the transitions are
accompanied by the emergence of a many-body generalization of previously found
single-particle hidden dualities. Finally, we show that in the limit of
vanishing interaction strength, all finite range interactions are irrelevant at
the non-interacting critical point.

In thermal equilibrium the dynamics of phase transitions is largely
controlled by fluctuation-dissipation relations: On the one hand, friction
suppresses fluctuations, while on the other hand the thermal noise is
proportional to friction constants. Out of equilibrium, this balance dissolves
and one can have situations where friction vanishes due to antidamping in the
presence of a finite noise level. We study a wide class of $O(N)$ field
theories where this situation is realized at a phase transition, which we
identify as a critical exceptional point. In the ordered phase, antidamping
induces a continuous limit cycle rotation of the order parameter with an
enhanced number of $2N-3$ Goldstone modes. Close to the critical exceptional
point, however, fluctuations diverge so strongly due to the suppression of
friction that in dimensions $d<4$ they universally either destroy a preexisting
static order, or give rise to a fluctuation-induced first order transition.
This is demonstrated within a non-perturbative approach based on
Dyson-Schwinger equations for $N=2$, and a generalization for arbitrary $N$,
which can be solved exactly in the long wavelength limit. We show that in order
to realize this physics it is not necessary to drive a system far out of
equilibrium: Using the peculiar protection of Goldstone modes, the transition
from an $xy$ magnet to a ferrimagnet is governed by an exceptional critical
point once weakly perturbed away from thermal equilibrium.

<h3>Theory of the microwave impedance microscopy of Chern insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09227</a>

Microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) has been utilized to directly visualize
topological edge states in many quantum materials, from quantum Hall systems to
topological insulators, across the GHz regime. While the microwave response for
conventional metals and insulators can be accurately quantified using simple
lumped-element circuits, the applicability of these classical models to more
exotic quantum systems remains limited. In this work, we present a general
theoretical framework of the MIM response of arbitrary quantum materials within
linear response theory. As a special case, we model the microwave response of
topological edge states in a Chern insulator and predict an enhanced MIM
response at the crystal boundaries due to collective edge magnetoplasmon (EMP)
excitations. The resonance frequency of these plasmonic modes should depend
quantitatively on the topological invariant of the Chern insulator state and on
the sample's circumference, which highlights their non-local, topological
nature. To benchmark our analytical predictions, we experimentally probe the
MIM response of quantum anomalous Hall edge states in a Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3
topological insulator and perform numerical simulations using a classical
formulation of the EMP modes based on this realistic tip-sample geometry, both
of which yield results consistent with our theoretical picture. We also show
how the technique of MIM can be used to quantitatively extract the topological
invariant of a Chern insulator, disentangle the signatures of topological
versus trivial edge states, and shed light on the microscopic nature of
dissipation along the crystal boundaries.

Driving a spin-logic circuit requires the production of a large output signal
by spin-charge interconversion in spin-orbit readout devices. This should be
possible by using topological insulators, which are known for their high
spin-charge interconversion efficiency. However, high-quality topological
insulators have so far only been obtained on a small scale, or with large scale
deposition techniques which are not compatible with conventional industrial
deposition processes. The nanopatterning and electrical spin injection into
these materials has also proven difficult due to their fragile structure and
low spin conductance. We present the fabrication of a spin-orbit readout device
from the topological insulator Sb2Te3 deposited by large-scale industrial
magnetron sputtering on SiO2. Despite a modification of the Sb2Te3 layer
structural properties during the device nanofabrication, we measured a sizeable
output voltage that can be unambiguously ascribed to a spin-charge
interconversion process.

<h3>Terahertz parametric amplification as a reporter of exciton condensate  dynamics</h3>

Condensates are a hallmark of emergence in quantum materials with
superconductors and charge density wave as prominent examples. An excitonic
insulator (EI) is an intriguing addition to this library, exhibiting
spontaneous condensation of electron-hole pairs. However, condensate
observables can be obscured through parasitic coupling to the lattice.
Time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy can disentangle such obscurants
through measurement of the quantum dynamics. We target $Ta_{2}NiSe_{5}$, a
putative room-temperature EI where electron-lattice coupling dominates the
structural transition ($T_{c}$=326 K), hindering identification of excitonic
correlations. A pronounced increase in the THz reflectivity manifests following
photoexcitation and exhibits a BEC-like temperature dependence. This occurs
well below the $T_{c}$, suggesting a novel approach to monitor exciton
condensate dynamics. Nonetheless, dynamic condensate-phonon coupling remains as
evidenced by peaks in the enhanced reflectivity spectrum at select
infrared-active phonon frequencies. This indicates that parametric reflectivity
enhancement arises from phonon squeezing, validated using Fresnel-Floquet
theory and density functional calculations. Our results highlight that coherent
dynamics can drive parametric stimulated emission with concomitant
possibilities, including entangled THz photon generation.

<h3>Adhesion of 2D MoS$_2$ to Graphite and Metal Substrates Measured by a  Blister Test</h3>

<br>
<i>Metehan Calis, David Lloyd, Narasimha Boddeti, J. Scott Bunch</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a blister test, we measured the work of separation between MoS$_2$
membranes from metal, semiconductor, and graphite substrates. We found a work
of separation ranging from 0.11 +- 0.05 J/m^2 for chromium to 0.39 +- 0.1 J/m^2
for graphite substrates. In addition, we measured the work of adhesion of
MoS$_2$ membranes over these substrates and observed a dramatic difference
between the work of separation and adhesion which we attribute to adhesion
hysteresis. Due to the prominent role that adhesive forces play in the
fabrication and functionality of devices made from 2D materials, an
experimental determination of the work of separation and adhesion as provided
here will help guide their development.

<h3>Magnetic poles enabled kirigami meta-structure for stable mechanical  memory storage with high information density</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09268</a>
<br>
<i>Libiao Xin, Yanbin Li, Baolong Wang, Zhiqiang Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Some bi or multi-stable Mechanical meta-structures have been implemented as
mechanical memory devices which however are with limits such as complex
structural forms, low information storage capability and/or fragile structural
stability to maintain the stored information bits robustly under external
interferences. To address these issues, we refer to the structural intelligence
by constructing a simple 3D-printable multi-layered cylindrical kirigami module
with gradient structural parameters and propose a mechanical memory device that
can robustly store information bits exponentially larger than previous designs.
We demonstrate the promising enhancement of information storage capability of
our proposed mechanical memory device relies on two mechanisms 1 the
deformation sequences of the kirigami module enabled by the gradient structural
parameter, which brings the extra dimensional degree of freedom to break the
traditional mechanical memory unit with only planar form and merits information
bits with spatially combinatorical programmability, and 2 the combinatorics of
the deformation independences among the cylindrical kiriagmi unit arrays in the
constructed mechanical memory device. Particularly, we achieve both the
structural stabilities and the desired structural robustness in the mechanical
memory devices by additively introducing magnetic N-S poles in units, which can
protect the stored information from interferences like mechanical crushing,
impacting and or shaking.

<h3>Weak Localisation Driven by Pseudospin-Spin Entanglement</h3>

<br>
<br>
At low temperatures, quantum corrections, originating from the interference
of the many paths an electron may take between two points, tend to dominate the
transport properties of two-dimensional conductors. These quantum corrections
increase the resistivity in systems such as two-dimensional electron gases
(2DEGs) without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), a phenomenon called weak
localisation. Including symmetry-breaking SOC leads to a change from weak
localisation (WL) to weak anti-localisation (WAL) of the electronic states,
i.e. a WL-to-WAL transition. Here, we revisit the Cooperon, the propagator
encoding quantum corrections, within the context of ultra-clean graphene-based
van der Waals heterostructures with strong symmetry-breaking Bychkov-Rashba SOC
to yield two completely counter-intuitive results. Firstly, we find that
quantum corrections vary non-monotonically with the SOC strength, a clear
indication of non-perturbative physics. Secondly, we observe the exact opposite
of that seen in 2DEGs with strong SOC: a WAL-to-WL transition. This dramatic
reversal is driven by mode entanglement of the pseudospin and spin degrees of
freedom describing graphene's electronic states. We obtain these results by
constructing a non-perturbative treatment of the Cooperon, and observe distinct
features in the SOC dependence of the quantum corrections to the electrical
conductivity that would otherwise be missed by standard perturbative
approaches.

<h3>Universal dynamics of rogue waves in a quenched spinor Bose condensate</h3>

<br>
<br>
Universal scaling dynamics of a many-body system far from equilibrium signals
the proximity of the time-evolution to a non-thermal fixed point. We find
universal dynamics connected with rogue-wave like events in the mutually
coupled magnetic components of a spinor gas which propagate in an effectively
random potential. The frequency of these caustics is affected by the time
varying spatial correlation length of the potential, giving rise to an
additional exponent $\delta_\mathrm{c} \simeq 1/3$ for temporal scaling, which
is different by a factor $\sim 4/3$ from the exponent $\beta_V \simeq 1/4$
characterizing the scaling of the correlation length $\ell_V \sim
t^{\,\beta_V}$ with time. As a result of the caustics, real-time instanton
defects appear in the Larmor phase of the spin-1 system as vortices in space
and time. The temporal correlations determining the frequency of instanton
events to occur scale in time as $t^{\, \delta_\mathrm{I}}$. This suggests that
the universality class of a non-thermal fixed point could be characterized by
different, mutually related exponents defining the coarsening evolution in time
and space, respectively. Our results have a strong relevance for understanding
pattern coarsening from first principles and potential implications for
dynamics ranging from the early universe to geophysical dynamics and micro
physics.

<h3>Excitons and trions in monolayer semiconductors with correlated  electrons</h3>

We revisit low-temperature optical spectra of transition-metal dichalcogenide
monolayers and point to a possible crystallization of electrons (or holes) at
low to moderate charge densities. To calculate the excitonic spectra under such
conditions, we introduce the recursion method and compute how the charge
density affects the energies, linewidths, and oscillator strengths of exciton
and trion complexes. Equally important, we study how excitons and trions in the
monolayer evolve when the charge particles gradually transition to a periodic
Wigner lattice. The results provide valuable information on the ability to
detect whether the particles are ordered through the exciton spectrum. Finally,
we calculate the change in exciton energy in cases that the added charge
particles have similar and dissimilar quantum numbers (spin and valley) to
those of the electron or hole in the exciton. The results of this work shed new
light on important optical properties of monolayer semiconductors.

<h3>The cost of stochastic resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09348</a>
<br>
<i>John C. Sunil, Richard A. Blythe, Martin R. Evans, Satya N. Majumdar</i>
<br>
<br>
Resetting a stochastic process has been shown to expedite the completion time
of some complex task, such as finding a target for the first time. Here we
consider the cost of resetting by associating a cost to each reset, which is a
function of the distance travelled during the reset event. We compute the
Laplace transform of the joint probability of first passage time $t_f$, number
of resets $N$ and resetting cost $C$, and use this to study the statistics of
the total cost. We show that in the limit of zero resetting rate the mean cost
is finite for a linear cost function, vanishes for a sub-linear cost function
and diverges for a super-linear cost function. This result contrasts with the
case of no resetting where the cost is always zero. For the case of an
exponentially increasing cost function we show that the mean cost diverges at a
finite resetting rate. We explain this by showing that the distribution of the
cost has a power-law tail with continuously varying exponent that depends on
the resetting rate.

<h3>Autonomous decision making for solid-state synthesis of inorganic  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09353" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09353</a>
<br>
<i>Nathan J. Szymanski, Pragnay Nevatia, Christopher J. Bartel, Yan Zeng, Gerbrand Ceder</i>
<br>
<br>
To aid in the automation of inorganic materials synthesis, we introduce an
algorithm (ARROWS3) that guides the selection of precursors used in solid-state
reactions. Given a target phase, ARROWS3 iteratively proposes experiments and
learns from their outcomes to identify an optimal set of precursors that leads
to maximal yield of that target. Initial experiments are selected based on
thermochemical data collected from first principles calculations, which enable
the identification of precursors exhibiting large thermodynamic force to form
the desired target. Should the initial experiments fail, their associated
reaction paths are determined by sampling a range of synthesis temperatures and
identifying their products. ARROWS3 then uses this information to pinpoint
which intermediate reactions consume most of the available free energy
associated with the starting materials. In subsequent experimental iterations,
precursors are selected to avoid such unfavorable reactions and therefore
maintain a strong driving force to form the target. We validate this approach
on three experimental datasets containing results from more than 200 distinct
synthesis procedures. When compared to several black-box optimization
algorithms, ARROWS3 identifies the most effective set of precursors for each
target while requiring substantially fewer experimental iterations. These
findings highlight the importance of using domain knowledge in the design of
optimization algorithms for materials synthesis, which are critical for the
development of fully autonomous research platforms.

<h3>Realization of Z$_2$ Topological Metal in Single-Crystalline Nickel  Deficient NiV$_2$Se$_4$</h3>

Temperature-dependent electronic and magnetic properties are reported for a
Z2 topological metal single-crystalline nickel-deficient NiV$_2$Se$_4$. It is
found to crystallize in the monoclinic Cr3S4 structure type with space group
I2=m. From single-crystal x-ray diffraction, we find that there are vacancies
on the Ni site, resulting in the composition Ni0:85V2Se4 in agreement with our
electron-probe microanalysis. The electrical resistivity shows metallic
behavior with a broad anomaly around 150{200 K that is also observed in the
heat capacity data. This anomaly indicates a change of state of the material
below 150 K. We believe that this anomaly could be due to spin fluctuations or
charge-density-wave (CDW) fluctuations, where the lack of long-range order is
caused by vacancies at the Ni site of Ni0:85V2Se4. Although we fail to observe
any structural distortion in this crystal down to 1.5 K, its electronic and
thermal properties are anomalous. The observation of non-linear temperature
dependence of resistivity as well as an enhanced value of the Sommerfeld
coefficient = 104.0(1) mJ/molK2 suggests strong electron-electron correlations
in this material. The first-principles calculations performed for
NiV$_2$Se$_4$, which are also applicable to Ni0:85V2Se4, classify this material
as a topological metal with Z2 = (1; 110) and coexisting electron and hole
pockets at the Fermi level. The phonon spectrum lacks any soft phonon mode,
consistent with the absence of periodic lattice distortion in the present
experiments.

<h3>Jahn-Teller distortion driven ferromagnetism in a perovskite fluoride  monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09359</a>
<br>
<i>Ke Ji, Zongshuo Wu, Xiaofan Shen, Jianli Wang, Junting Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
The Jahn-Teller distortion and the resulting orbital order usually cause some
fascinating correlated electronic behaviors, and generally lead to
antiferromagnetism in perovskite bulks. Here we demonstrate that the
Jahn-Teller distortion present in the perovskite fluoride KCrF$_3$ bulk can be
retained to the two-dimensional limit, resulting in a staggered orbital order
and ferromagnetism in the perovskite monolayer. Octahedral tilt and rotation
distortion also appear in the ground-state structure of the perovskite
monolayer, which have minor effects on the electronic and magnetic properties
with respect to the Jahn-Teller distortion. In addition, in the prototype phase
without structural distortion, the partial occupation of the $e_g$ orbitals
leads to a ferromagnetic metallic state. This work facilitates the design of
two-dimensional ferromagnets and functional properties based on Jahn-Teller
distortion and orbital order

<h3>Direct measurement of the Meissner screening profile in  superconductor-superconductor bilayers using low-energy muon spin rotation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, which are critical components
in many particle accelerators, need to be operated in the Meissner state to
avoid strong dissipation from magnetic vortices. For a defect-free
superconductor, the maximum attainable magnetic field for operation is set by
the superheating field, $B_{\mathrm{sh}}$, which directly depends on the
surface current. In heterostructures composed of different superconductors, the
current in each layer depends not only on the properties of the individual
material, but also on the electromagnetic response of the adjacent layers
through boundary conditions at the interfaces. Three prototypical bilayers
[$\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$(50 nm)/Nb, $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$(80 nm)/Nb, and
$\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$(160 nm)/Nb] are investigated here by depth-resolved
measurements of their Meissner screening profiles using low-energy muon spin
rotation (LE-$\mu$SR). From fits to a model based on London theory (with
appropriate boundary and continuity conditions), a magnetic penetration depth
for the thin $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ layers of $\lambda_\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}
=$ 182.5(31) nm is found, in good agreement with literature values for the bulk
alloy. In contrast, a simple London model without appropriate boundary
conditions overestimates $\lambda_\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ by more than a factor
of two, suggesting that it is inappropriate for quantifying
$\lambda_\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ here. Using the measured
$\lambda_\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$, the maximum vortex-free field,
$B_{\mathrm{max}}$, of the superconductor-superconductor (SS) bilayer structure
was estimated to be 610(40) mT. The strong suppression of the surface current
in the $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ layer suggests an optimal thickness of $\sim
1.4 \lambda_{\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}} =$ 261(14) nm.

<br>
<br>
Chiral materials have garnered significant attention in the field of
condensed matter physics. Nevertheless, the magnetic moment induced by the
chiral spatial motion of electrons in helical materials, such as elemental Te
and Se, remains inadequately understood. In this work, we investigate the
development of quantum angular momentum enforced by chirality using static and
time-dependent density functional theory calculations for an elemental Se
chain. Our findings reveal the emergence of an unconventional orbital texture
driven by the chiral geometry, giving rise to a non-vanishing current-induced
orbital moment. By incorporating spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that a
current-induced spin accumulation arises in the chiral chain, which
fundamentally differs from the conventional Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the optoelectronic detection of the orbital angular momentum in the
chiral Se chain, providing a conceptually novel alternative to the interband
Berry curvature, which is ill-defined in low dimensions.

<br>
<br>
We systematically investigated the Ni and Co thickness-dependent
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) coefficient, magnetic domain
structures, and magnetization dynamics of Pt(5 nm)/[Co(t_Co nm)/Ni(t_Ni
nm)]5/Pt(1 nm) multilayers by combining the four standard magnetic
characterization techniques. The magnetic-related hysteresis loops obtained
from the field-dependent magnetization M and anomalous Hall resistivity (AHR)
\r{ho}_xy found that the two serial multilayers with t_Co = 0.2 and 0.3 nm have
the optimum PMA coefficient K_U well as the highest coercivity H_C at the Ni
thickness t_Ni = 0.6 nm. Additionally, the magnetic domain structures obtained
by Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy also significantly depend on the
thickness and K_U of the films. Furthermore, the thickness-dependent linewidth
of ferromagnetic resonance is inversely proportional to K_U and H_C, indicating
that inhomogeneous magnetic properties dominate the linewidth. However, the
intrinsic Gilbert damping constant determined by a linear fitting of
frequency-dependent linewidth does not depend on Ni thickness and K_U. Our
results could help promote the PMA [Co/Ni] multilayer applications in various
spintronic and spin-orbitronic devices.

Atomically thin van der Waals magnetic materials have not only provided a
fertile playground to explore basic physics in the two-dimensional (2D) limit
but also created vast opportunities for novel ultrafast functional devices.
Here we systematically investigate ultrafast magnetization dynamics and spin
wave dynamics in few-layer topological antiferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 crystals as a
function of layer number, temperature, and magnetic field. We observe
laser-induced (de)magnetization processes that can be used to accurately track
the distinct magnetic states in different magnetic field regimes, including
showing clear odd-even layer number effects. In addition, strongly
field-dependent antiferromagnetic magnon modes with tens of gigahertz
frequencies are optically generated and directly observed in the time domain.
These measurements present the first comprehensive overview of ultrafast spin
dynamics in this novel 2D antiferromagnet, paving the way for potential
applications in 2D antiferromagnetic spintronics and magnonics as well as
further studies of ultrafast control of both magnetization and topological
quantum states.

Fullerene cages allow the confinement of single molecules and the
construction of molecular assemblies whose properties strongly deviate from
those of free species. In this work, we employ the density-matrix
renormalization group method to show that chains of fullerenes filled with
polar molecules (LiF, HF, and H2O) can form dipole-ordered quantum phases. In
symmetry broken environments, these ordered phases are ferroelectric, a
property that makes them promising candidates for quantum devices. We
demonstrate that for a given guest molecule, the occurrence of these quantum
phases can be enforced or influenced by either changing the effective electric
dipole moment or by isotopic substitution. In the ordered phase, all systems
under consideration are characterized by a universal behavior that only depends
on the ratio of the effective electric dipole divided by the rotational
constant. A phase diagram is derived and further molecules are proposed as
candidates for dipole-ordered endofullerene chains.

On-chip cavity magnomechanics is an emerging field exploring acoustic and
magnonic functionalities of various ferromagnetic materials and structures
using strongly confined phonons. It is expected that such cavity magnomechanics
can be extended to multilayer ferromagnets, especially synthetic
antiferromagnets (SAFs) that exhibit zero net magnetization through interlayer
exchange coupling. However, the conventional theoretical framework for a single
ferromagnet cannot be used directly because of the antiferromagnetic
magnetization dynamics associated with the interlayer exchange coupling. In
this paper, we theoretically investigate phonon-magnon coupling with a
three-layer SAF. Our formulation of the phonon-magnon coupling constants
reveals that the acoustic (optical) magnon mode dominantly couples to the
cavity phonon when the magnetization angles in the two ferromagnetic layers are
antiparallel (orthogonal). Moreover, numerical calculations including the
effects of dipole-dipole interactions and in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy
allow us to predict phonon frequency shifts and linewidth broadening that can
be detected in experiments. These theoretical insights would greatly help us to
make a strategy for bringing the system into the strong coupling regime and to
devise novel control protocols in analogy to cavity quantum electrodynamics and
cavity optomechanics.

<i>Shi-Qi Hu, Hui Zhao, Xin-Bao Liu, Da-Qiang Chen, Sheng Meng</i>
<br>
<br>
Acting as a highly nonlinear response to the strong laser field, high
harmonic generation (HHG) naturally contains the fingerprints of atomic and
electronic properties of materials. Electronic properties of a solid such as
band structure and topology can thus be probed, while the phonon dynamics
during HHG are often neglected. Here we show that by exploiting the effects of
phonon deformation on HHG, the intrinsic phonon information can be deciphered
and direct probing of band- and mode-resolved electron-phonon couplings (EPC)
of photoexcited materials is possible. Considering HHG spectroscopy can be
vacuum free and unrestricted to electron occupation, this work suggests HHG is
promising for all-optical characterization of EPC in solids, especially for
gapped quantum states or materials under high pressure.

<br>
Current-induced bond rupture is a fundamental process in nanoelectronic
architectures such as molecular junctions and in scanning tunneling microscopy
measurements of molecules at surfaces. The understanding of the underlying
mechanisms is important for the design of molecular junctions that are stable
at higher bias voltages and is a prerequisite for further developments in the
field of current-induced chemistry. In this work, we analyse the mechanisms of
current-induced bond rupture employing a recently developed method, which
combines the hierarchical equations of motion approach in twin space with the
matrix product state formalism, and allows accurate, fully quantum mechanical
simulations of the complex bond rupture dynamics. Extending previous work [J.
Chem. Phys. 154, 234702 (2021)], we consider specifically the effect of
multiple electronic states and multiple vibrational modes. The results obtained
for a series of models of increasing complexity show the importance of vibronic
coupling between different electronic states of the charged molecule, which can
enhance the dissociation rate at low bias voltages profoundly.

<h3>Room-temperature antiferromagnetic CrSe monolayer with tunable  metal-insulator transition in ferroelectric heterostructures</h3>

Recently, there has been a rapidly growing interest in two-dimensional (2D)
transition metal chalcogenide monolayers (MLs) due to their unique magnetic and
electronic properties. By using an evolutionary algorithm and first-principles
calculations, we report the discovery of a previously unexplored, chemically,
energetically, and thermodynamically stable 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSe ML
with a N\'eel temperature higher than room temperature. Remarkably, we predict
an electric field-controllable metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a van der
Waals (vdW) heterostructure comprised of CrSe ML and ferroelectric Sc2CO2. This
tunable transition in CrSe/Sc2CO2 heterostructure is attributed to the change
in the band alignment between CrSe and Sc2CO2 caused by the ferroelectric
polarization reversal in Sc2CO2. Our findings suggest that 2D AFM CrSe ML has
important potential applications in AFM spintronics, particularly in the gate
voltage conducting channel.

<h3>Thermoelectric effect of skyrmion crystal confined in a magnetic disk</h3>

<i>Junnosuke Matsuki, Masahito Mochizuki</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically propose that an electric voltage can be generated by thermal
gradient with a rotating skyrmion crystal confined in a magnetic disk. We find
that the rotation of skyrmion crystal induced by diffusive thermal magnon
currents in the presence of temperature gradient gives rise to spinmotive
forces in the radial direction through coupling to conduction-electron spins.
The amplitude of generated spinmotive force is larger for a larger temperature
gradient at a lower temperature. The proposed phenomenon can be exploited as
spintronics-based thermoelectric devices to realize the conversion of heat to
electricity.

<br>

We investigate the ground state properties of quantum skyrmions in a
ferromagnet using variational Monte Carlo with the neural network quantum state
as variational ansatz. We study the ground states of a two-dimensional quantum
Heisenberg model in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI). We show that the ground state accommodates a quantum skyrmion for a
large range of parameters, especially at large DMI. The spins in these quantum
skyrmions are weakly entangled, and the entanglement increases with decreasing
DMI. We also find that the central spin is completely disentangled from the
rest of the lattice, establishing a non-destructive way of detecting this type
of skyrmion by local magnetization measurements. While neural networks are well
suited to detect weakly entangled skyrmions with large DMI, they struggle to
describe skyrmions in the small DMI regime due to nearly degenerate ground
states and strong entanglement. In this paper, we propose a method to identify
this regime and a technique to alleviate the problem. Finally, we analyze the
workings of the neural network and explore its limits by pruning. Our work
shows that neural network quantum states can be efficiently used to describe
the quantum magnetism of large systems exceeding the size manageable in exact
diagonalization by far.

The chemical potential u of an electron system is a fundamental property of a
solid. A precise measurement of u plays a crucial role in understanding the
electron interaction and quantum states of matter. However, thermodynamics
measurements in micro and nanoscale samples are challenging because of the
small sample volume and large background signals. Here, we report an optical
readout technique for u of an arbitrary two-dimensional (2D) material. A
monolayer semiconductor sensor is capacitively coupled to the sample. The
sensor optical response determines a bias that fixes its chemical potential to
the band edge and directly reads u of the sample. We demonstrate the technique
in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moire bilayers. We obtain u with DC sensitivity about
20 ueV/sqrt(Hz), and the compressibility and interlayer electric polarization
using AC readout. The results reveal a correlated insulating state at the
doping density of one hole per moire unit cell, which evolves from a Mott to a
charge-transfer insulator with increasing out-of-plane electric field.
Furthermore, we image u and quantify the spatial inhomogeneity of the sample.
Our work opens the door for high spatial and temporal resolution measurements
of the thermodynamic properties of 2D quantum materials.

<h3>Revisiting boundary-driven non-equilibrium Markov dynamics in arbitrary  potentials via supersymmetric quantum mechanics and explicit large deviations  at various levels</h3>

<br>
<br>
For boundary-driven non-equilibrium Markov models of non-interacting
particles in one dimension, either in continuous space with the Fokker-Planck
dynamics involving an arbitrary force $F(x)$ and an arbitrary diffusion
coefficient $D(x)$, or in discrete space with the Markov jump dynamics
involving arbitrary nearest-neighbor transition rates $w(x \pm 1,x)$, the
Markov generator can be transformed via an appropriate similarity
transformation into a quantum supersymmetric Hamiltonian with many remarkable
properties. In particular, the mapping from the boundary-driven non-equilibrium
dynamics towards some dual equilibrium dynamics [J. Tailleur, J. Kurchan and V.
Lecomte, J. Phys. A 41, 505001 (2008)] can be reinterpreted via the two
corresponding quantum Hamiltonians that are supersymmetric partners of each
other, with the same energy spectra. We describe the consequences for the
spectral decomposition of the boundary-driven dynamics, and we give explicit
expressions for the Kemeny times needed to converge towards the non-equilibrium
steady states. Finally, we analyze the large deviations at various levels for
empirical time-averaged observables over a large time-window $T$. We start with
the always explicit Level 2.5 concerning the joint distribution of the
empirical density and of the empirical flows, and we then consider the
contractions towards lower levels. In particular, the rate function for the
empirical current alone can be explicitly computed via the contraction from the
Level 2.5 using the properties of the associated quantum supersymmetric
Hamiltonians.

Bose gas on a two-leg ladder exhibits an interesting topological phase. We
show the presence of a bosonic symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) phase
protected by $Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetry. This symmetry leads to $Z_4$ fractional
quantization of $Z_4$ Berry phase, that is a topological order parameter to
identify the bulk. Using the $Z_4$ Berry phase, we have shown that the
interacting bosonic system possesses rich topological phases depending on
particle density and strength of interaction. Based on the bulk-edge
correspondence, each edge state of the SPT phases is discussed in relation to
the $Z_4$ Berry phases. Especially we have found an intermediate phase that is
not adiabatically connected to a simple adiabatic limit, that possesses
unconventional edge states, which we have numerically demonstrate by employing
the density-matrix-renormalization group algorithm.

The emergence of macroscopic coherence in a many-body quantum system is a
ubiquitous phenomenon across different physical systems and scales. This
Chapter reviews key concepts characterizing such systems (correlation
functions, condensation, quasi-condensation) and applies them to the study of
emerging non-equilibrium features in the dynamical path towards such a
highly-coherent state: particular emphasis is placed on emerging universal
features in the dynamics of conservative and open quantum systems, their
equilibrium or non-equilibrium nature, and the extent that these can be
observed in current experiments with quantum gases. Characteristic examples
include symmetry-breaking in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, coarsening and
phase-ordering kinetics, and universal spatiotemporal scalings around
non-thermal fixed points and in the context of the Kardar- Parisi-Zhang
equation; the Chapter concludes with a brief review of the potential relevance
of some of these concepts in modelling the large-scale distribution of dark
matter in the universe.

<br>
<br>
We monitor the transformation of a liquid into an amorphous solid in
simulations of a glass forming liquid by measuring the variation of a
structural order parameter with either changing temperature or potential energy
to establish the influence of the cooling rate on amorphous solidification. We
show that the latter representation, unlike the former, exhibits no significant
dependence on cooling rate. This independence extends to the limit of
instantaneous quenches which we find can accurately reproduce the
solidification observed during slow cooling. We conclude that amorphous
solidification is an expression of the topography of the energy landscape and
present the relevant topographic measures.

In recent years, halide perovskite materials have been used to make high
performance solar cell and light-emitting devices. However, material defects
still limit device performance and stability. Here, we use synchrotron-based
Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging to visualise nanoscale strain fields, such
as those local to defects, in halide perovskite microcrystals. We find
significant strain heterogeneity within MAPbBr$_{3}$ (MA =
CH$_{3}$NH$_{3}^{+}$) crystals in spite of their high optoelectronic quality,
and identify both $\langle$100$\rangle$ and $\langle$110$\rangle$ edge
dislocations through analysis of their local strain fields. By imaging these
defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, we uncover
dramatic light-induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometres.
Further, by selectively studying crystals that are damaged by the X-ray beam,
we correlate large dislocation densities and increased nanoscale strains with
material degradation and substantially altered optoelectronic properties
assessed using photoluminescence microscopy measurements. Our results
demonstrate the dynamic nature of extended defects and strain in halide
perovskites and their direct impact on device performance and operational
stability.

<i>Tianyi Yan, Matthew Colllins, Rejish Nath, Weibin Li</i>
<br>
<br>
We study signatures of quantum chaos in dynamics of Rydberg dressed bosonic
atoms held in a one dimensional triple-well potential. Long-range
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, induced by laser
dressing atoms to strongly interacting Rydberg states, affect drastically mean
field and quantum many-body dynamics. By analyzing the mean field dynamics,
classical chaos regions with positive and large Lyapunov exponents are
identified as a function of the potential well tilting and dressed
interactions. In the quantum regime, it is found that level statistics of the
eigen-energies gains a Wigner-Dyson distribution when the Lyapunov exponents
are large, giving rise to signatures of strong quantum chaos. We find that both
the time averaged entanglement entropy and survival probability of the initial
state have distinctively large values in the quantum chaos regime. We further
show that population variances could be used as an indicator of the emergence
of quantum chaos. This might provide a way to directly probe quantum chaotic
dynamics through analyzing population dynamics in individual potential wells.

Atomic simulations hold significant value in clarifying crucial matters such
as phase transitions and energy transport in materials science. Their success
stems from the presence of potential energy functions capable of accurately
depicting the relationship between system energy and lattice changes. In
magnetic materials, two atomic scale degrees of freedom come into play: the
lattice and the magnetic moment. Nonetheless, precisely portraying the
interaction energy and its impact on lattice and spin-driving forces, such as
atomic force and magnetic torque, remains a formidable task in the
computational domain. Consequently, there is no atomic-scale approach capable
of elucidating the evolution of lattice and spin at the same time in magnetic
materials. Addressing this knowledge deficit, we present DeepSPIN, a versatile
approach that generates high-precision predictive models of energy, atomic
forces, and magnetic torque in magnetic systems. This is achieved by
integrating first-principles calculations of magnetic excited states with
advanced deep learning techniques via active learning. We thoroughly explore
the methodology, accuracy, and scalability of our proposed model in this paper.
Our technique adeptly connects first-principles computations and atomic-scale
simulations of magnetic materials. This synergy presents opportunities to
utilize these calculations in devising and tackling theoretical and practical
obstacles concerning magnetic materials.

We investigate the existence of interface states induced by broken inversion
symmetries in two-dimensional quasicrystal lattices. We introduce a 10-fold
rotationally symmetric quasicrystal lattice whose inversion symmetry is broken
through a mass dimerization that produces two 5-fold symmetric sub-lattices. By
considering resonator scatterers attached to an elastic plate, we illustrate
the emergence of bands of interface states that accompany a band inversion of
the quasicrystal spectrum as a function of the dimerization parameter. These
bands are filled by modes which are localized along domain-wall interfaces
separating regions of opposite inversion symmetry. These features draw
parallels to the dynamic behavior of topological interface states in the
context of the valley Hall effect, which has been so far limited to periodic
lattices. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate wave-guiding in a
quasicrystal lattice featuring a zig-zag interface with sharp turns of 36
degrees, which goes beyond the limitation of 60 degrees associated with 6-fold
symmetric (i.e., honeycomb) periodic lattices. Our results provide new
opportunities for symmetry-based quasicrystalline topological waveguides that
do not require time-reversal symmetry breaking, and that allow for higher
freedom in the design of their waveguiding trajectories by leveraging
higher-order rotational symmetries.

MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the first confirmed intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological
insulator, have attracted more and more attention in recent years. Here we
investigate the energy correction and lifetime of magnons in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
caused by magnon-magnon interaction. Firstly, a first-principles calculation
was performed to get the parameters of the magnetic Hamiltonian of
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Then the perturbation method of many-body Green's function is
applied and the 1st-order self-energy [$\Sigma^{(1)}({\bf k})$] and 2nd-order
self-energy [$\Sigma^{(2)}({\bf k},\varepsilon_{\bf k})$] of magnon are
obtained. Numerical computation shows that the correction from both
$\Sigma^{(1)}({\bf k})$ and $\Sigma^{(2)}({\bf k},\varepsilon_{\bf k})$ are
strongly dependent on momentum and temperature, the energy renormalization near
Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary is obviously stronger than that near BZ centre. We
also find that some dip structures occur in renormalized magnon spectrum near
$\rm K$ and $\rm M$ points, and these dip structures should be attributed to
$\Sigma^{(2)}({\bf k},\varepsilon_{\bf k})$.

We investigate the Coulomb blockade in quantum dots asymmetrically coupled to
the leads for an arbitrary voltage bias focusing on the regime where electrons
do not thermalise during their dwell time in the dot. By solving the quantum
kinetic equation, we show that the current-voltage characteristics are
crucially dependent on the ratio of the Fermi energy to charging energy on the
dot. In the standard regime when the Fermi energy is large, there is a Coulomb
staircase which is practically the same as in the thermalised regime. In the
opposite case of the large charging energy, we identify a new regime in which
only one step is left in the staircase, and we anticipate experimental
confirmation of this finding.

We study the transport properties of a tight-binding model of non-interacting
fermions with random hopping on the honeycomb lattice. At the particle-hole
symmetric chemical potential, the absence of diagonal disorder (random onsite
potentials) places the system in the well-studied chiral orthogonal
universality class of disordered fermion problems, which are known to exhibit
both a critical metallic phase and a dimerization-induced localized phase.
Here, our focus is the behavior of the two-terminal conductance and the
Lyapunov spectrum in quasi-1D geometry near the dimerization-driven transition
from the metallic to the localized phase. For a staggered dimerization pattern
on the square and honeycomb lattices, we find that the renormalized
localization length $\xi/M$ ($M$ denotes the width of the sample) and the
typical conductance display scaling behavior controlled by a crossover
length-scale that diverges with exponent $\nu \approx 1.05(5)$ as the critical
point is approached. However, for the plaquette dimerization pattern, we
observe a relatively large exponent $\nu \approx 1.55(5)$ revealing an apparent
non-universality of the delocalization-localization transition in the BDI
symmetry class.

We apply the rotation-invariant Green's function method to study the
finite-temperature properties of a $S{=}1/2$ sawtooth-chain (also called
$\Delta$-chain) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model at the fully frustrated
point when the exchange couplings along the straight-line and zig-zag paths are
equal. We also use 13 terms of high-temperature expansion series and
interpolation methods to get thermodynamic quantities for this model. We check
the obtained predictions for observable quantities by comparison with numerics
for finite systems. Although our work refers to a one-dimensional case, the
utilized methods work in higher dimensions too and are applicable for examining

The overdamped dynamics of a particle is in general affected by its
interaction with the surrounding medium, especially out of equilibrium, and
when the latter develops spatial and temporal correlations. Here we consider
the case in which the medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field with
relaxational dynamics, and the particle is dragged at constant velocity through
the medium by a harmonic trap. This mimics the setting of an active
microrheology experiment conducted in a near-critical medium. When the particle
is displaced from its average position in the nonequilibrium steady state, its
subsequent relaxation is shown to feature damped oscillations. This is similar
to what has been recently predicted and observed in viscoelastic fluids, but
differs from what happens in the absence of driving or for an overdamped
Markovian dynamics, in which cases oscillations cannot occur. We characterize
these oscillating modes in terms of the parameters of the underlying mesoscopic
model for the particle and the medium, confirming our analytical predictions
via numerical simulations.

A self-consistent stochastic model of domain structure formation in a
uniaxial ferroelectric, quenched from a high-temperature paraelectric phase to
a low-temperature ferroelectric phase, is developed with an account of the
applied electric field and the feedback effect via local depolarization fields.
Both polarization and field components are considered as Gauss random
variables. A system of integro-differential equations for correlation functions
of all involved variables is derived and solved analytically and numerically.
Phase diagram in terms of the average value and dispersion of polarization
reveals different possible equilibrium states and available final single-domain
and multi-domain states. The time-dependent evolution of the average
polarization and dispersion discloses a bifurcation behavior and the
temperature-dependent value of the electric field, deciding between the
single-domain and multi-domain final states, which can be interpreted as the
coercive field. Analytical and numerical results for the time-dependent
correlation length and correlation functions exhibit plausible agreement with
available experimental data.

We investigate the quantum quench dynamics of the interacting Hatano-Nelson
model with open boundary conditions using both abelian bosonization and
numerical methods. Specifically, we follow the evolution of the particle
density and current profile in real space over time by turning the imaginary
vector potential on or off in the presence of weak interactions. Our results
reveal spatio-temporal Friedel oscillations in the system with light cones
propagating ballistically from the open ends, accompanied by local currents of
equal magnitude for both switch off and on protocols. Remarkably, the
bosonization method accurately accounts for the density and current patterns
with a single overall fitting parameter. The continuity equation is satisfied
by the long wavelength part of the density and current, despite the non-unitary
time evolution when the Hatano-Nelson term is switched on.

We present a study on the transport and materials properties of aluminum
spanning from ambient to warm dense matter conditions using a machine-learned
interatomic potential (ML-IAP). Prior research has utilized ML-IAPs to simulate
phenomena in warm dense matter, but these potentials have often been calibrated
for a narrow range of temperature and pressures. In contrast, we train a single
ML-IAP over a wide range of temperatures, using density functional theory
molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) data. Our approach overcomes computational
limitations of DFT-MD simulations, enabling us to study transport and materials
properties of matter at higher temperatures and longer time scales. We
demonstrate the ML-IAP transferability across a wide range of temperatures
using molecular-dynamics (MD) by examining the thermal conductivity, diffusion
coefficient, viscosity, sound velocity, and ion-ion structure factor of
aluminum up to about 60,000 K, where we find good agreement with previous
theoretical data.

Understanding the Hubbard model is crucial for investigating various quantum
many-body states and its fermionic and bosonic versions have been largely
realized separately. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides heterobilayers
have emerged as a promising platform for simulating the rich physics of the
Hubbard model. In this work, we explore the interplay between fermionic and
bosonic populations, using a $\rm{WS}_2$/$\rm{WSe}_2$ heterobilayer device that
hosts this hybrid particle density. We independently tune the fermionic and
bosonic populations by electronic doping and optical injection of electron-hole
pairs, respectively. This enables us to form strongly interacting excitons that
are manifested in a large energy gap in the photoluminescence spectrum. The
incompressibility of excitons is further corroborated by measuring exciton
diffusion, which remains constant upon increasing pumping intensity, as opposed
to the expected behavior of a weakly interacting gas of bosons, suggesting the
formation of a bosonic Mott insulator. We explain our observations using a
two-band model including phase space filling. Our system provides a
controllable approach to the exploration of quantum many-body effects in the
generalized Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model.

The interaction mechanisms of water with nanoscale geometries remain poorly
understood. This study focuses on behaviour of water clusters under varying
external electric fields with a particular focus on molecular ferroelectric
devices. We employ a two-fold approach, combining experiments with large-scale
molecular dynamics simulations on graphene nanoribbon field effect transistors.
We show that bilayer graphene nanoribbons provide stable anchoring of water
clusters on the oxygenated edges, resulting in a ferroelectric effect. A
molecular dynamics model is then used to investigate water cluster behaviour
under varying external electric fields. Finally, we show that these nanoribbons
exhibit significant and persistent remanent fields that can be employed in
ferroelectric heterostructures and neuromorphic circuits.

<h3>Activated and quantum creep of the charge-density waves in magnetic  field in {\it o}-TaS$_3$</h3>

We demonstrate that magnetoresistance of creeping charge-density waves in the
quasi-one dimensional conductor {\it o}-TaS$_3$ changes its character from a
negative parabolic at $T\gtrsim 10$ K where it obeys $1/T^2$ law to a weakly
temperature dependent negative nearly linear one at lower temperatures. The
dominant contribution into the negative parabolic magnetoresistance comes from
magnetic field induced splitting of the CDW order parameter. The linear
magnetoresistance arises due to CDW quantum interference similar to the
scenario of negative linear magnetoresistance in single-electron systems.

Highly spatially-squeezed polaritons, with propagation momentum significantly
larger than free-space modes at the same frequency, enable varied and extreme
control over light-matter interaction. Compared to other polaritons, surface
magnon polaritons, the magnetic counterpart of surface phonon polaritons, have
received relatively little attention. Here, we investigate the dispersion and
properties of surface-magnon polaritons, highlighting the impact of geometric
similarities and applying them to various surface-magnon polariton devices in
both conventional and topological settings. Our theory predicts a method for
strongly localizing and significantly enhancing magnetic fields in the
microwave range and developing compact and lossless connectors capable of
interconnecting waveguides with vastly different input and output impedances.
Our work opens new avenues for manipulating magnetic fields in the microwave
regime and for exploring topological phases in polariton platforms.

<h3>Planar Hall effect in topological Weyl and nodal line semimetals</h3>

Using symmetry analysis and semiclassical Boltzmann equation, we
theoretically explore the planar Hall effect (PHE) in three-dimensional
materials. We demonstrate that PHE is a general phenomenon that can occur in
various systems regardless of band topology. Both the Lorentz force and Berry
curvature effects can induce significant PHE, and the leading contributions of
both effects linearly depend on the electric and magnetic fields. The Lorentz
force and Berry curvature PHE coefficient possess only antisymmetric and
symmetric parts, respectively. Both contributions respect the same crystalline
symmetry constraints but differ under time-reversal symmetry. Remarkably, for
topological Weyl semimetal, the Berry curvature PHE coefficient is a constant
that does not depends on the Fermi energy, while the Lorentz force contribution
linearly increases with the Fermi energy, resulting from the linear dispersion
of the Weyl point. Furthermore, we find that the PHE in topological nodal line
semimetals is mainly induced by the Lorentz force, as the Berry curvature in
these systems vanishes near the nodal line. Our study not only highlights the
significance of the Lorentz force in PHE, but also reveals its unique
characteristics, which will be beneficial for determining the Lorentz force
contribution experimentally.

<h3>Atomic dynamics in fluids: Normal mode analysis revisited</h3>

Developing microscopic understanding of the thermal properties of liquids is
challenging due to their strong dynamic disorder, which prevents
characterization of the atomic degrees of freedom. There have been significant
research interests in the past few decades to extend the normal mode analysis
for solids to instantaneous structures of liquids. However, the nature of
normal modes that arise from these unstable structures is still elusive. In
this work, we explore the instantaneous eigenmodes of dynamical matrices of
various Lennard-Jones argon liquid/gas systems at high temperatures and show
that the normal modes can be interpreted as an interpolation of T \to \infty
(gas) and T = 0 (solid) mode descriptions. We find that normal modes become
increasingly collisional and translational, recovering atomistic gas-like
behavior rather than vibrational with increase in temperature, suggesting that
normal modes in liquids may be described by both solid-like and gas-like modes.

<h3>Interacting quantum walk on a two-leg flux ladder: Emergence of  re-entrant dynamics</h3>

We study the quench dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-leg flux ladder
by implementing the continuous-time quantum walk and explore the combined
effect of the magnetic field and onsite interaction in the presence of uniform
flux. We show that in the regime of weak interaction, the magnetic field
substantially slows down the spreading of the particles' wavefunction during
the dynamics. However, in the presence of strong interaction, we obtain an
interesting re-entrant behaviour in the dynamics where the radial velocity
associated to the spreading first increases, then decreases, and increases
again as a function of the flux strength. We also find a re-entrant dynamics in
the chiral motion of the particles as a function of interaction for fixed flux
strengths.

Semiconductor moir\'e superlattices have been shown to host a wide array of
interaction-driven ground states. However, twisted homobilayers have been
difficult to study in the limit of large moir\'e wavelength, where interactions
are most dominant, and despite numerous predictions of nontrivial topology in
these homobilayers, experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here, we
conduct local electronic compressibility measurements of twisted bilayer
WSe$_2$ at small twist angles. We demonstrate multiple topological bands which
host a series of Chern insulators at zero magnetic field near a 'magic angle'
around $1.23^\circ$. Using a locally applied electric field, we induce a
topological quantum phase transition at one hole per moir\'e unit cell.
Furthermore, by measuring at a variety of local twist angles, we characterize
how the interacting ground states of the underlying honeycomb superlattice
depend on the size of the moir\'e unit cell. Our work establishes the
topological phase diagram of a generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in tWSe$_2$,
demonstrating a tunable platform for strongly correlated topological phases.

Different superconducting pairing mechanisms are markedly distinct in the
underlying Cooper pair kinematics. Pairing interactions mediated by
quantum-critical soft modes are dominated by highly collinear processes,
falling into two classes: forward scattering and backscattering. In contrast,
phonon mechanisms have a generic non-collinear character. We show that the type
of kinematics can be identified by examining the evolution of superconductivity
when tuning the Fermi surface geometry. We illustrate our approach using
recently measured phase diagrams of various graphene systems. Our analysis
unambiguously connects the emergence of superconductivity at ``ghost
crossings'' of Fermi surfaces in distinct valleys to the pair kinematics of a
backscattering type. Together with the observed non-monotonic behavior of
superconductivity near its onset (sharp rise followed by a drop), it provides
strong support for a particular quantum-critical superconductivity scenario.
These findings conclusively settle the long-standing debate on the origin of
superconductivity in this system and demonstrate the essential role of
quantum-critical modes in superconducting pairing. Moreover, our work
highlights the potential of tuning bands via ghost crossings as a promising
means of boosting superconductivity.
