<h3>Polaron with Quadratic Electron-phonon Interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01475</a>

<br>
<br>
We present the first numerically exact study of a polaron with quadratic
coupling to the oscillator displacement, using two alternative methodological
developments. Our results cover both anti-adiabatic and adiabatic regimes and
the entire range of electron-phonon coupling $g_2$, from the system's stability
threshold at attractive $g_2=-1$ to arbitrary strong repulsion at $g_2 \gg 1$.
Key properties of quadratic polarons prove dramatically different from their
linear counterparts. They (i) are insensitive even to large quadratic coupling
except in the anti-adiabatic limit near the threshold of instability at
attraction; (ii) depend only on the adiabatic ratio but are insensitive to the
electron dispersion and dimension of space; (iii) feature weak lattice
deformations even at the instability point. Our results are of direct relevance
to properties of electrons at low densities in polar materials, including
recent proposals for their superconducting states.

<h3>Bulk ReSe2: record high refractive index and biaxially anisotropic  material for all-dielectric nanophotonics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01501" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01501</a>

<br>
<br>
We show that bulk rhenium diselenide, ReSe2 is characterized by record high
value of the refractive index exceeding 5 in near-infrared frequency range. We
use back focal plane reflection spectroscopy to extract the components of the
ReSe2 permittivity tensor and reveal its extreme biaxial anisotropy. We also
demonstrate the good agreement between the experimental data and the
predictions of the density functional theory. The combination of the large
refractive index and giant optical anisotropy makes ReSe2 a perspective
material for all-dielectric nanophotonics in the near-infrared frequency range.

<h3>Quantum Monte Carlo method describing supported metal catalysis:  Ni(111)/alumina decomposing methane as a route to hydrogen</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01823" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01823</a>

Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is
gathering pace. Doubling the capacity of Paris-CDG airport has been halted,
even with the upcoming Olympic Games, until hydrogen-powered planes can be
used. It is thus timely to work on catalytic selective hydrogen production and
optimise catalyst structure. Over 90% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid
catalyst. This work describes the dissociation of a C-H bond in methane,
chemisorbed at Ni(111) that stabilises the ensuing Ni-H linkage. In a
subsequent step, gaseous hydrogen is given off. Many chemical reactions involve
bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction
steps at solid surfaces. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by
Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology is used.
Our embedded active site approach demonstrates novel QMC. The rate-limiting
reaction step of methane decomposition to hydrogen and carbon is the initial
C-H bond stretch. The full dissociation energy is offset by Ni-H bond formation
at the surface. Reactive methyl (CH$_3$) radicals also interact with a vicinal
Ni. These adsorbed methyl radicals subsequently produce methylene and hydrogen,
with one atom dissociated from the methyl radical and the other desorbed from
the Ni surface. The QMC activation barrier found is 85.4 +/- 1.1 kJ/mol JCP C
(2020). Thus, QMC is shown to be encouraging for investigating similar
catalytic systems.

<h3>Renormalization group analysis of a self-organized critical system:  Intrinsic anisotropy vs random environment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01913" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01913</a>
<br>
<i>N.V. Antonov, P.I. Kakin, N.M. Lebedev, A.Yu. Luchin</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a self-organized critical system coupled to an isotropic random
fluid environment. The former is described by a strongly anisotropic continuous
(coarse-grained) model introduced by Hwa and Kardar [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 62}
1813 (1989); Phys. Rev. A {\bf 45} 7002 (1992)]; the latter is described by the
stirred Navier--Stokes equation due to Forster, Nelson and Stephen [Phys. Rev.
A {\bf 16} 732 (1977)]. The full problem of two coupled stochastic equations is
represented as a field theoretic model, which is shown to be multiplicatively
renormalizable. The corresponding renormalization group equations possess a
semi-infinite curve of fixed points in the four-dimensional space of the model
parameters. The whole curve is infrared attractive for realistic values of
parameters; its endpoint corresponds to the purely isotropic regime where the
original Hwa-Kardar nonlinearity becomes irrelevant. There, one is left with a
simple advection of a passive scalar field by the external environment. The
main critical dimensions are calculated to the leading one-loop order (first
terms in the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion); some of them are appear to be exact
in all orders. They remain the same along that curve, which makes it reasonable
to interpret it as a single universality class. However, the correction
exponents do vary along the curve. It is therefore not clear whether the curve
survives in all orders of the renormalization group expansion or shrinks to a
single point when the higher-order corrections are taken into account.

<h3>Topology of protocells: do nanoholes catalyse fission ?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02089" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02089</a>

<i>Romain Attal</i>
<br>

We propose a mechanism with a low activation energy for lipid translocation,
based on a change of topology of the membrane of a protocell. The inner and
outer layers are connected and form toroidal nanoholes stabilised by repulsive
electrostatic forces for small radius and attractive elastic forces for large
radius. Thanks to these holes, the energy barrier of translocation is
drastically reduced and a difference of temperature between the inside and the
outside of the protocell can induce a differential growth of these layers,
until the vesicle splits in two.

<h3>Fragile dense suspensions under shear rotation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02165" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02165</a>
<br>
<i>Frédéric Blanc, François Peters, Jurriaan J.J. Gillissen, Michael E. Cates, Sandra Bosio, Camille Benarroche, Romain Mari</i>
<br>
<br>
While quasi-Newtonian complex fluids under steady-state flow, dense
non-Brownian suspensions exhibit complex "macro-fragile" behaviors under
unsteady flow conditions, as revealed by abrupt shear inversions (reversals).
Here, we introduce an experimental setup to systematically explore their
macro-fragile response to shear rotations, where one suddenly rotates the
principal axes of shear by an angle $\theta$. This reveals a transient decrease
of the shear stress under shear rotation. Moreover, the orthogonal shear
stress, which vanishes in steady state, takes non-negligible values with a rich
$\theta$-dependence, changing qualitatively with solid volume fraction $\phi$,
and resulting in a force that tends to reduce or enhance the direction of flow
for small or large $\phi$. These findings are confirmed and rationalized by
particle-based numerical simulations and a recently proposed constitutive
model. We show that the rotation angle dependence of the orthogonal stress
results from from a $\phi$-dependent interplay between hydrodynamic and contact
stresses.

<h3>Modelling of Quantum Dots with the Finite Element Method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02212" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02212</a>
<br>
<i>G.A. Mantashian, P.A. Mantashyan, D.B. Hayrapetyan</i>
<br>
<br>
Considering the increasing number of experimental results in the
manufacturing process of quantum dots with different geometries, and the fact
that most numerical methods that can be used to investigate quantum dots with
non-trivial geometries require large computational capacities the finite
element method becomes an incredibly attractive tool for modeling semiconductor
QDs. In the current article, the authors have used the FEM to obtain the first
twenty-six probability densities and energy values for the following GaAs
structures: rectangular, spherical, cylindrical, ellipsoidal, spheroidal, and
conical QDs, quantum rings, nanotadpoles, and nanostars. The results of the
numerical calculations were compared with the exact analytical solutions and a
good deviation was obtained. The ground states energies dependence on the
element size was obtained to find the optimal parameter for the investigated
structures. The abovementioned calculation results were used to obtain valuable
insight into the effects of the size quantization s dependence on the shape of
the QDs. Additionally, the wavefunctions and energies of spherical CdSe/CdS
quantum dots were obtained while taking into account the diffusion effects on
the potential depth with the use of a piecewise Woods-Saxon potential. The
diffusion of the effective mass and the dielectric permittivity is obtained
with the use of a normal Woods-Saxon potential. A structure with a
quasi-type-II band alignment was obtained at the core size of 2.2nm. This
result is consistent with the experimental data.

<h3>Coherent magnon-induced domain wall motion in a magnetic insulator  channel</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01408" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01408</a>

Advancing the development of spin-wave devices requires high-quality
low-damping magnetic materials where magnon spin currents can propagate
efficiently and interact effectively with local magnetic textures. We show that
magnetic domain walls (DW) can modulate spin-wave transport in perpendicularly
magnetized channels of Bi-doped yttrium-iron-garnet (BiYIG). Conversely, we
demonstrate that the magnon spin current can drive DW motion in the BiYIG
channel device by means of magnon spin-transfer torque. The DW can be reliably
moved over 15 um distances at zero applied magnetic field by a magnon spin
current excited by an RF pulse as short as 1 ns. The required energy for
driving DW motion is orders of magnitude smaller than those reported for
metallic systems. These results facilitate low-switching-energy magnonic
devices and circuits where magnetic domains can be efficiently reconfigured by
magnon spin currents flowing within magnetic channels.

<h3>High temperature equilibrium of 3D and 2D chalcogenide perovskites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01429</a>

<br>

Chalcogenide perovskites have been recently under the researchers spotlight
as novel absorber materials for photovoltaic applications. BaZrS$_3$, the most
investigated compound of this family, shows a high absorption coefficient, a
bandgap of around 1.8 eV, and excellent environmental and thermal stability. In
addition to the 3D perovskite BaZrS$_3$, the Ba-Zr-S compositional space
contains various 2-D Ruddlesden-Popper phases Ba$_{x+1}$Zr$_x$S$_{3x+1}$ (with
$x=$ 1, 2, 3) which have recently been reported. In this work it will be shown
that at high temperature the Gibbs free energies of 3D and 2D perovskites are
very close, suggesting that 2D phases can be easily formed at high
temperatures. The analysis of the product of the BaS and ZrS$_2$ solid-state
reaction, both in stoichiometric and Zr-rich conditions, present a mixture of
BaZrS$_3$ and Ba$_4$Zr$_3$S$_{10}$, supporting the thermodynamic calculations
result. To carefully resolve the composition, XRD, SEM and EDS analysis were
complemented with Raman spectroscopy. For this purpose, the phonon modes, and
the consequent Raman spectra, were calculated for the 3D and 2D chalcogenide
perovskites, as well as for the binary precursors. This thorough
characterization will demonstrate that the formation of 3D and 2D mixtures is
thermodynamically possible, and that it is important to use of multiple
techniques to soundly resolve the composition of these chalcogenide materials.

<h3>Machine Learned Interatomic Potential for Dispersion Strengthened Plasma  Facing Components</h3>

Tungsten (W) is a material of choice for the divertor material due to its
high melting temperature, thermal conductivity, and sputtering threshold.
However, W has a very high brittle-to-ductile transition temperature and at
fusion reactor temperatures ($\geq$1000K) may undergo recrystallization and
grain growth. Dispersion-strengthening W with zirconium carbide (ZrC) can
improve ductility and limit grain growth, but much of the effects of the
dispersoids on microstructural evolution and thermomechanical properties at
high temperature are still unknown. We present a machine learned Spectral
Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) for W-ZrC that can now be used to study
these materials. In order to construct a potential suitable for large-scale
atomistic simulations at fusion reactor temperatures, it is necessary to train
on ab initio data generated for a diverse set of structures, chemical
environments, and temperatures. Further accuracy and stability tests of the
potential were achieved using objective functions for both material properties
and high temperature stability. Validation of lattice parameters, surface
energies, bulk moduli, and thermal expansion is confirmed on the optimized
potential. Tensile tests of W/ZrC bicrystals show that while the
W(110)-ZrC(111) C-terminated bicrystal has the highest ultimate tensile
strength (UTS) at room temperature, observed strength decreases with increasing
temperature. At 2500K, the terminating C layer diffuses into the W, resulting
in a weaker W-Zr interface. Meanwhile, the W(110)-ZrC(111) Zr-terminated
bicrystal has the highest UTS at 2500K.

<h3>Topological waves in the continuum in magnetized graphene devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01489" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01489</a>
<br>
<i>A. Ciobanu, P. Cosme, H. Terças</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that topological waves at the interface between two magnetic domains
in a graphene device are possible. First, we consider the case of a linear
relation between the applied gate voltage and local density in the channel and,
secondly, we investigate the effect of non-local Coulomb interactions. We
obtain two distinct edge modes for each interaction type: a Yanai mode with
rotational flow and dispersion relation that extends to infinite wave-number,
and a Kelvin mode with purely longitudinal flow and bound dispersion relation.
The scattering matrix concept is applied to verify the infinite frequency
regime of the spectrum, and the bulk-edge correspondence principle is satisfied
if one takes into account the Kelvin modes that merge with an imaginary cut of
the bulk band.

<h3>Microstructure Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes Characterized  by Persistent Homology</h3>

Uncovering microstructure evolution mechanisms that accompany the long-term
operation of solid oxide fuel cells is a fundamental challenge in designing a
more durable energy system for the future. To date, the study of fuel cell
stack degradation has focused mainly on electrochemical performance and, more
rarely, on averaged microstructural parameters. Here we show an alternative
approach in which an evolution of three-dimensional microstructural features is
studied using electron tomography coupled with topological data analysis. The
latter produces persistent images of microstructure before and after long-term
operation of electrodes. Those images unveil a new insight into the degradation
process of three involved phases: nickel, pores, and yttrium-stabilized
zirconium.

<h3>Efficient Multiple Exciton Generation in Monolayer MoS2</h3>

Utilizing the excess energy of photoexcitation that is otherwise lost as
thermal effects can improve the efficiency of next-generation light-harvesting
devices. Multiple exciton generation (MEG) in semiconducting materials yields
two or more excitons by absorbing a single high-energy photon, which can break
the Shockley-Queisser limit for the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic
devices. Recently, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have
emerged as promising light-harvesting materials because of their high
absorption coefficient. Here, we report efficient MEG with low threshold energy
and high (86%) efficiency in a van der Waals (vdW) layered material, MoS2.
Through different experimental approaches, we demonstrate the signature of
exciton multiplication and discuss the possible origin of decisive MEG in
monolayer MoS2. Our results reveal that vdW-layered materials could be a
potential candidate for developing mechanically flexible and highly efficient
next generation solar cells and photodetectors.

<h3>On the origin of tail states and VOC losses in Cu(In,Ga)Se2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01603</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The detrimental effect of tail states on the radiative and non-radiative
voltage loss has been demonstrated to be a limiting factor for the open circuit
voltage in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. A strategy that has proven effective in
reducing tail states is the addition of alkali metals, the effect of which has
been associated with the passivation of charged defects at grain boundaries.
Herein, tail states in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 are revisited by studying the effect of
compositional variations and alkali incorporation into single crystals. The
results demonstrate that alkalis decrease the density of tail states despite
the absence of grain boundaries, suggesting that there is more to alkalis than
just grain boundary effects. Moreover, an increase in doping as a result of
alkali incorporation is shown to contribute to the reduced tail states, which
are demonstrated to arise largely from electrostatic potential fluctuations and
to be determined by grain interior properties. By analyzing the voltage loss in
high-efficiency polycrystalline and single crystalline devices, this work
presents a model that explains the entirety of the voltage loss in Cu(In,Ga)Se2
based on the combined effect of doping on tail states and VOC.

We report here our preliminary results in the study of a new version of the
generalized Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion process (gTASEP) on open
tracks. In the gTASEP an additional interaction between the particles is
considered, besides the hard-core exclusion, which exists in the standard
TASEP. It is modeled by the introduction of a second hopping probability $p_m$
for the particles, belonging to the same cluster, in addition to the standard
hopping probability p, which now applies only for single particles and the head
(rightmost) particle of a cluster. We briefly describe how one can obtain
analytically solvable version of gTASEP by modifying the left (injection)
boundary condition. A short comparison is made with the previously studied
version of gTASEP on open tracks.

<h3>Tuning Superconductivity and Charge Density Wave Order in 2H-TaSe2 by  Modulating the Van Hove Singularity</h3>

Tantalum diselenide (TaSe2) is an exciting material that hosts charge density
wave order (CDW) and superconductivity. Thus, providing a playing field for
examining the interactions of fundamental electronic quantum states in
materials. Recent research has proposed that the intrinsic quantum electronic
state in the TaSe2 lattice could be improved by aligning the Van Hove
singularity (VHs) with the Fermi level. In this study, we attempt to tune the
VHs in TaSe2 to align them within the vicinity of the Fermi level via electron
doping by chemically substituting Pt for Ta atoms. On investigating the band
structure of Pt0.2Ta0.8Se2, the electron doping brought the VHs closer to the
Fermi level vicinity around the K high symmetry point. As a result, the CDW
state in pristine TaSe2 is suppressed in the TaSe2 doped system while also
hosting an enhanced superconducting temperature (Tc) of ~2.7 K. These
observations provide insight into ways to leverage the VHs in materials to tune
their electronic properties.

<h3>Cathodic Carbon Chemically Adsorbs Carbon Dioxide: Why Is it True?</h3>

<br>
Large-scale applications are waiting for an optimal CO2 scavenger to
reinforce CCS and CCU technologies. We herein introduce and succinctly validate
a new philosophy of capturing gaseous CO2 by negatively-charged carbonaceous
structures. The chemical absorption of CO2 turns out possible thanks to the
emergence of significant nucleophilic interaction carbon centers upon applying
voltage. The carbonaceous cathode, therefore, may serve as a prototype of a new
CO2 sorbent. As a model to simulate chemisorption, we used a small-sized
graphene quantum dot (GQD). According to the recorded reaction profiles, the
negatively charged GQD containing 16 carbon atoms readily reacts with the CO2
molecule and produces carboxylated GQD. In turn, the activation energy (60
kJ/mol) and energy effect ( 55 kJ/mol) for the reaction in water appeared
surprisingly competitive in the context of the literature. We hypothesize that
the carbonaceous cathode deserves in-depth experimental research as a possible
CO2 chemical sorbent. Despite we used GQD for simulations, the encouraging
results can be extrapolated to other nanoscale carbons and, more importantly,
to the activated carbon species widely employed in modern electrochemical
devices.

<h3>Fusion protocol for Majorana modes in coupled quantum dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01653</a>

<i>Chun-Xiao Liu, Haining Pan, F. Setiawan, Michael Wimmer, Jay D. Sau</i>
<br>
<br>
In a recent breakthrough experiment (arXiv:2206.08045), Majorana zero modes
have been observed in tunnel spectroscopy for a minimal Kitaev chain
constructed from coupled quantum dots. However, as Ising anyons, Majoranas'
most fundamental property of non-Abelian statistics is yet to be detected.
Moreover, the minimal Kitaev chain is qualitatively different from topological
superconductors in that it supports Majoranas only at a sweet spot. Therefore
it is not obvious whether non-Abelian characteristics such as braiding and
fusion can be demonstrated in this platform with a reasonable level of
robustness. In this work, we theoretically propose a protocol for detecting the
Majorana fusion rules in an artificial Kitaev chain consisting of four quantum
dots. In contrast with the previous proposals for semiconductor-superconductor
hybrid nanowire platforms, here we do not rely on mesoscopic superconducting
islands, which are difficult to implement in quantum dot chains. To show the
robustness of the fusion protocol, we discuss the effects of three types of
realistic imperfections on the fusion outcomes, e.g. diabatic errors, dephasing
errors, and calibration errors. We also propose a Fermion parity readout scheme
using quantum capacitance. Our work will shed light on future experiments on
detecting the non-Abelian properties of Majorana modes in a quantum dot chain.

This work contains a review of the theoretical understanding for the
Almeida-Thouless
transition. The effective field theoretic model for this transition to the
replica symmetry broken phase
is extended to low temperatures, making it possible to compute perturbative
corrections to the mean field phase boundary
even close to zero temperature. Nonperturbative behavior emerges both around
the zero-external-field transition and at low temperature. Renormalization
group results are
also discussed.

<h3>Energy levels of graphene magnetic quantum dot in inhomogeneous gap</h3>

We investigate the energy levels of charge carriers confined in a magnetic
quantum dot in graphene with an inhomogeneous gap through an electrical
potential. We solve the eigenvalue equation for two regions. We explicitly
determine the eigenspinors for both valleys $ K $, $ K' $ and use the boundary
condition at the quantum dot interface to obtain the energy levels. We show
that the energy levels exhibit symmetric and asymmetric behavior under
appropriate conditions of the physical parameters. It has been found that
changing the energy levels by introducing an energy gap outside the quantum dot
changes the electrical properties.

The dielectric effects of a substrate have been shown to be important in
modulating the electronic properties of an adsorbate, especially in van der
Waals heterostructures. Here, using the first-principles dielectric embedding
$GW$ approach within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, we perform
a case study on the dielectric screening effects of hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) on various transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We consider three
systems: monolayer MoS$_2$, bilayer MoS$_2$, and mixed WS$_2$/MoS$_2$ bilayer
adsorbed on hBN, and examine three aspects of the substrate dielectric
screening: (i) thickness dependence and the monolayer-to-bulk transition, where
we consider the effects of one-, two-, three-, and four-layer hBN; (ii)
local-field effect, where we numerically assess a common approximation of
neglecting the in-plane local-field components of the substrate polarizability;
and (iii) spatial dependence, where we consider mixed WS$_2$/MoS$_2$ bilayer
adsorbed on hBN with either side facing the substrate. Our results provide
quantitative insight into how the substrate screening effects can be leveraged
for band structure engineering.

<br>
Understanding various aspects of ferroelectricity in hafnia-based
nanomaterials is of vital importance for the development of future non-volatile
memory and logic devices. Here, the unconventional and weak electromechanical
response of epitaxial
$La_{0.67}Sr_{0.33}MnO_{3}$/$Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_{2}$/$La_{0.67}Sr_{0.33}MnO_{3}$
ferroelectric capacitors is investigated, via the sensitivity offered by
nanobeam X-ray diffraction experiments during application of electrical bias.
It is shown that the pristine rhombohedral phase exhibits a negative linear
piezoelectric effect with piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{33}$) ~ -0.5 to -0.8
pm$V^{-1}$. First-principles calculations support an intrinsic negative
piezoresponse. In addition, it is found that the piezoelectric response is
suppressed above the coercive voltage. For higher voltages, and with the onset
of DC conductivity throughout the capacitor, a second-order effect is observed.
The electromechanical response observed in this work is clearly different from
that of normal ferroelectrics, again underlining the unconventional nature of
polarization switching in the samples.

In this work, we explore the structure of single-wall boron nanotubes with
large diameters (about 21~{\AA}) and a broad range of surface densities of
atoms. The computations are done using an evolutionary approach combined with a
nearest neighbors model Hamiltonian. For the most stable nanotubes, the number
of 5-coordinated boron atoms is about $63\%$ of the total number of atoms
forming the nanotubes, whereas about $11\%$ are boron vacancies. For hole
densities smaller than about 0.22, the boron nanotubes exhibit randomly
distributed hexagonal holes and are more stable than a flat stripe structure
and a quasi-flat B$_{36}$ cluster. For larger hole densities ($> 0.22$) the
boron nanotubes resemble porous tubular structures with hole sizes that depend
on the surface densities of boron atoms.

<br>
Motivated by the observation of even denominator fractional quantum Hall
effect in the $n=3$ Landau level of monolayer graphene [Y. Kim $\textit{et
al.}$, Nature Physics $\textbf{15}$, 154 (2019)], we consider a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer variational state for composite fermions and find
that the composite-fermion Fermi sea in this Landau level is unstable to an
$f$-wave pairing. Analogous calculation suggests the possibility of a $p$-wave
pairing of composite fermions at half filling in the $n=2$ graphene Landau
level, whereas no pairing instability is found at half filling in the $n=0$ and
$1$ graphene Landau levels. The relevance of these results to experiments is
discussed.

Y3Fe5O12 is arguably the best magnetic material for magnonic quantum
information science (QIS) because of its extremely low damping. We report
ultralow damping at 2 K in epitaxial Y3Fe5O12 thin films grown on a diamagnetic
Y3Sc2Ga3O12 substrate that contains no rare-earth elements. Using these
ultralow damping YIG films, we demonstrate for the first time strong coupling
between magnons in patterned YIG thin films and microwave photons in a
superconducting Nb resonator. This result paves the road towards scalable
hybrid quantum systems that integrate superconducting microwave resonators, YIG
film magnon conduits, and superconducting qubits into on-chip QIS devices.

As the continuing down-scaling of field-effect transistors (FETs) in
more-than-Moore integrated circuits, finding new functional two-dimensional
(2D) materials with a higher dielectric constant (high-k) serve as gate
dielectrics is critical. Here, we identify dozens of binary 2D oxides by
screening potentially exfoliable bulk metal oxides despite of their non-layered
structures followed by simulation of the exfoliation process. For dynamically
stable materials, we fully characterize their static dielectric constants and
electronic structures, among which GeO2(011)/(101)/(1-11) 2D oxides exhibit
unusually high k values (85-99), being much higher than the k of the currently
highly regarded 2D dielectrics CaF2 (k ~6) and \b{eta}-Bi2SeO5 (k ~22),
together with band gap of 3.3 eV. We further design 2D high-k oxides/2D
semiconductors (such as MoS2) heterostructures, and determine by DFT
calculations whether they can form Van der Waals interfaces to evaluate their
compatibility as gate dielectrics in 2D FETs. In addition to dielectric
properties, we also explore magnetic and mechanical properties of potentially
exfoliable 2D oxides, revealing a number of functional materials that can be
studied experimentally, notably including ferromagnetic half semiconductors,
non-magnetic spintronic materials, flexible high-k 2D oxides, and auxetic
monolayers.

<br>
<br>
The stacked two layered materials with a lattice constant mismatch and/or
with twist angle relative to each other can create a moir\'e pattern,
modulating the electronic properties of the pristine materials. Here, we
combine scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional
theory calculations to investigate the moir\'e potential induced bandgap tuning
in InSe/CuSe vertical heterostructure synthesized by a two-step of molecular
beam epitaxy. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements demonstrate the
heterostructure with a superlattice periodicity of ~3.48nm and a twist angle of
about 11{\deg} between the monolayers. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy record
on the different stacking sites of the heterostructure reveals the bandgap of
the InSe is location-dependent and a variation of 400 meV is observed. Density
functional theory calculations reveal that the moir\'e-induce electric dipole
in the monolayer InSe is the key factor for tuning the bandgap. Besides, charge
transfer between CuSe and InSe also contributes to the bandgap variation due to
its stacking related. We also show that the moir\'e potential not only can tune
the bandgap of InSe but also can vanish the Dirac nodal line of CuSe in some
stackings. Our explorations provide valuable information in understanding the
electronic properties of the twodimensional moir\'e materials.

Understanding the stability limitations and defect formation mechanisms in 2D
magnets is essential for their utilization in spintronic and memory
technologies. Here, we correlate defects in mono- to multilayer CrSBr with
their structural, vibrational and magnetic properties. We use resonant Raman
scattering to reveal distinct vibrational defect signatures. In pristine CrSBr,
we show that bromine atoms mediate vibrational interlayer coupling, allowing
for distinguishing between surface and bulk defect modes. We show that
environmental exposure causes drastic degradation in monolayers, with the
formation of intralayer defects. Through deliberate ion irradiation, we tune
the formation of defect modes, which we show are strongly polarized and
resonantly enhanced, reflecting the quasi-1D electronic character of CrSBr.
Strikingly, we observe pronounced signatures of spin-phonon coupling of the
intrinsic phonon modes and the ion beam induced defect modes throughout the
magnetic transition temperature. Overall, we demonstrate that CrSBr shows air
stability above the monolayer threshold, and provide further insight into the
quasi-1D physics present. Moreover, we demonstrate defect engineering of
magnetic properties and show that resonant Raman spectroscopy can serve as a
direct fingerprint of magnetic phases and defects in CrSBr.

Integration of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdWs) materials with
non-2D materials to realize mixed-dimensional heterostructures has potential
for creating functional devices beyond the reach of existing materials and has
long been a pursuit of the material science community. Here we report the
patterning of monolayer/bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
nanostructures with nanometer-precision, tunable sizes and sites at interfaces
of graphene/TMD heterostructures. Our experiments demonstrate that the TMD
nanostructures can be created at selected positions of the interface using
scanning tunneling microscope lithography and, more importantly, the sizes of
the interfacial TMD nanostructures can be tuned with nanoscale precise by
merging adjacent TMD nanostructures or by further tailoring. A structural phase
transition from hexagonal phase in bulk TMD to monoclinic phase in the
interfacial nanostructures is explicitly observed, which locally introduce
well-defined electrostatic potentials on graphene. These results not only
enable the creation of high-quality patterned p-n junctions in vdWs
heterostructures, but also provide a new route to realize custom-designed
mixed-dimensional heterostructures.

<h3>Should classical density functional theory be based on forces? A  comparative study</h3>

<br>
<i>Florian Sammüller, Sophie Hermann, Matthias Schmidt</i>
<br>
<br>
We re-examine results obtained with the recently proposed density functional
theory framework based on forces (force-DFT) [Tschopp et al., Phys. Rev. E 106,
014115 (2022)]. We compare inhomogeneous density profiles for hard sphere
fluids to results from both standard density functional theory (DFT) and from
computer simulations. Test situations include the equilibrium hard sphere fluid
adsorbed against a planar hard wall and the dynamical relaxation of hard
spheres in a switched harmonic potential. The comparison to grand canonical
Monte-Carlo simulation profiles shows that equilibrium force-DFT alone does not
improve upon results obtained with the standard Rosenfeld functional. Similar
behavior holds for the relaxation dynamics, where we use our event-driven
Brownian dynamics data as benchmark. Based on an appropriate linear combination
of standard and force-DFT results, we propose a simple hybrid scheme which
rectifies these deficiencies in both the equilibrium and the dynamical case. We
explicitly demonstrate that although the hybrid method is based on the original
Rosenfeld fundamental measure functional, its performance is comparable to that
of the more advanced White-Bear theory.

<h3>Universal bounds on entropy production inferred from observed statistics</h3>

Nonequilibrium processes break time-reversal symmetry and generate entropy.
Living systems are driven out-of-equilibrium at the microscopic level of
molecular motors that exploit chemical potential gradients to transduce free
energy to mechanical work, while dissipating energy. The amount of energy
dissipation, or the entropy production rate (EPR), sets thermodynamic
constraints on cellular processes. Practically, calculating the total EPR in
experimental systems is challenging due to the limited spatiotemporal
resolution and the lack of complete information on every degree of freedom.
Here, we propose a new inference approach for a tight lower bound on the total
EPR given partial information, based on an optimization scheme that uses the
observed transitions and waiting times statistics. We introduce hierarchical
bounds relying on the first- and second-order transitions, and the moments of
the observed waiting time distributions, and apply our approach to two generic
systems of a hidden network and a molecular motor, with lumped states. Finally,
we show that a lower bound on the total EPR can be obtained even when assuming
a simpler network topology of the full system.

Numerical underflow and overflow are major hurdles for rolling-out the
modeling and simulation infrastructure for temperatures below about 50 K.
Extending the numeric precision is computationally intensive and thus best
avoided. The root cause of these numerical challenges lies in the Fermi-Dirac,
Bose-Einstein, and Boltzmann distribution functions. To tackle their extreme
values, bounded distribution functions are proposed which are numerically safe
in a given precision, yet identical to the standard distributions at the
physical level. These functions can help to develop electron device models and
TCAD software handling deep-cryogenic temperatures in the default double
precision, to keep pace with the rapid experimental progress. More broadly,
they can apply to other branches of applied physics with similar numerical
challenges as well.

<br>
<br>
The ability to modify and tune the spin-wave dispersion is one of the most
important requirements for engineering of magnonic networks. In this study we
demonstrate the promise of synthetic thin-film hybrids composed of an
antiferromagnetic insulator (AF) and a normal (N) or superconducting (S) metal
for tuning and modifying the spin-wave dispersion in antiferromagnetic
insulators. The key ingredient is the uncompensated magnetic moment at the
AF/S(N) interface, which induces an effective exchange field in the adjacent
metal via the interface exchange interaction. The exchange field spin polarizes
quasiparticles in the metal and induces spinful triplet Cooper pairs screening
the magnon. The quasiparticle and Cooper pair polarization renormalizes the
magnon dispersion. The renormalization results in the splitting of the
otherwise degenerate AF magnon modes with no need of applying a magnetic field.
It is also proposed that measurements of the renormalized dispersion relations
can provide the amplitude of the effective exchange field induced by the AF in
the adjacent metal.

We compute the typical number of equilibria of the Generalized Lotka-Volterra
equations describing species-rich ecosystems with random, non-reciprocal
interactions using the replicated Kac-Rice method. We characterize the
multiple-equilibria phase by determining the average abundance and overlap
between equilibria as a function of their diversity (i.e. of the number of
coexisting species) and of the variability of the interactions. We show that
linearly unstable equilibria are dominant, and that the typical number of
equilibria differs with respect to the average number.

<br>
The electronic transport properties of Janus monolayer black arsenic
phosphorus (b-AsP) nanoribbons have been investigated utilizing the
tight-binding approach. The dependence of electronic structure on edge
structures is systematically investigated. (1,3)nb and (3,1)nb b-AsP
nanoribbons exhibit flatter edge bands than zigzag and armchair counterparts.
The edge band of the armchair ones show double degeneracy. Further, the
calculated results show the band gap of the zigzag ribbon with different
boundary morphology is widely tunable by transverse electric field. A critical
electric field can fully close the gap and induce a phase transition from a
semiconductor into a conductor. Our work suggests dynamically tunable bandgap
in Janus b-AsP nanoribbons and reveals the potential of Janus b-AsP for
transmission devices.

In this work, we investigate the electronic and optical properties of the
b-AsP quantum dots(QDs) and quantum rings(QRs) with different edge types in the
presence of an in-plane electric field and a perpendicular magnetic field
utilizing the tight-binding method. Our calculations show that the electronic
and optical properties of edge states largely depend on the edge types. By
adjusting the intensity of the electric field or magnetic field, the
probability density can be effectively tuned. In particular, under an in-plane
electric field, novel edge states emerge in rhombus QDs and QRs with {\delta}
atoms, and transitions happen between these novel edge states and bulk states
in the conduction band region, which is illustrated by distinct and evenly
separated peaks in the optical absorption spectra. This work might exploit a
potential system to implement quantum state transfer among two-dimensional
material quantum dots.

<h3>Appearance of Odd-Frequency Superconductivity in a Relativistic Scenario</h3>

<br>
<i>Patrick J. Wong, Alexander V. Balatsky</i>
<br>
<br>
Odd-frequency superconductivity is an exotic superconducting state in which
the symmetry of the gap function is odd in frequency. Here we show that an
inherent odd-frequency mode emerges dynamically under application of a Lorentz
transformation of the anomalous Green function with the general
frequency-dependent gap function. To see this, we consider a Dirac model with
quartic potential and perform a mean-field analysis to obtain a relativistic
Bogoliubov-de Gennes system. Solving the resulting Gor'kov equations yields
expressions for relativistic normal and anomalous Green functions. The form of
the relativistically invariant pairing term is chosen such that it reduces to
BCS form in the non-relativistic limit. We choose an ansatz for the gap
function in a particular frame which is even-frequency and analyze the effects
on the anomalous Green function under a boost into a relativistic frame. The
odd-frequency pairing emerges dynamically as a result of the boost. In the
boosted frame the order parameter contains terms which are both even and odd in
frequency. The relativistic correction to the anomalous Green function to first
order in the boost parameter is completely odd in frequency. This work provides
evidence that odd-frequency pairing may form intrinsically within relativistic
superconductors.

<i>Ishita Tikader, Olivia Mallick, Muktish Acharyya</i>
<br>
<br>
We have studied the magnetic relaxation behavior of a two-dimensional Ising
ferromagnet by Monte Carlo simulation. Our primary goal is to investigate the
effects of the system's geometry, boundary conditions, and dynamical rules on
the relaxation behavior. The Glauber and Metropolis dynamical rules have been
employed. The periodic and open boundary conditions are applied. The major
findings are the dependence of relaxation (exponential) time ($\tau$) on the
aspect ratio $R$ (length over breadth). In the limit of a small aspect ratio,
the relaxation time is almost independent of the geometrical structure.
However, a power law dependence ($\tau \sim R^{-s}$) has been observed for
larger values of aspect ratios. The exponent ($s$) has been found to depend
linearly ($s=aT+b$) on the system's temperature($T$). The transient behaviours
of the spin-flip density have also been investigated for both surface and
bulk/core. The size dependencies of spin-flip density significantly differ for
the surface and for the bulk. Both the bulk/core and surface spin-flip density
was found to follow the power law $f_d \sim L^{-\alpha}$ in the ferromagnetic
regime.The faster relaxation was
observed for open boundary condition for any kind (Metropolis/Glauber) of
dynamical rule.
Similarly, Metropolis algorithm yields faster relaxation for any
kind (open/periodic) of boundary condition.

We calculate the quasiparticle density of states (DoS) inside the vortex core

for dirty superconductors. A discrete version of the Usadel equation for a
vortex is derived and solved numerically for a broad range of parameters.
Electron DoS is found to be gapful when the vortex size $\xi$ becomes
comparable to the distance between neighboring grains $l$. Minigap magnitude
$E_g$ grows from zero at $\xi \approx 1.4 l$ to third of superconducting gap
$\Delta_0 $ at $\xi \approx 0.5 l$. The absence of low-energy excitations
explains strong suppression of microwave dissipation in a mixed state of
granular Al.

Local electronic properties of quasi-two-dimensional Pb(111) islands with
screw dislocations of different types on their surfaces were experimentally
studied by means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy in the regime of constant current. A comparison of the topography
map, the maps of tunneling current variation and the differential tunneling
conductance acquired simultaneously allows one to visualize the hidden parts of
the dislocation loops under the sample surface. We demonstrate that two
closely-positioned screw dislocations with the opposite Burgers vectors can
either (i) connect to each other by the sub-surface dislocation loop or (ii)
generate independent hidden edge dislocation lines which run towards the
perimeter of the Pb island. In addition, we found a screw dislocation, which
does not produce outcoming sub-surface dislocation loops. Screw dislocations
and the hidden dislocations lines are the source of the non-quantized variation
of the local thickness of the Pb terraces, affecting the local electronic
properties.

We report on electronic transport in dual-gate, artificially stacked bilayer
graphene field effect transistors (BiGFETs) fabricated from large-area chemical
vapor deposited (CVD) graphene. The devices show enhanced tendency to current
saturation, which leads to reduced minimum output conductance values. This
results in improved intrinsic voltage gain of the devices when compared to
monolayer graphene FETs. We employ a physics based compact model originally
developed for Bernal stacked bilayer graphene FETs (BSBGFETs) to explore the
observed phenomenon. The improvement in current saturation may be attributed to
increased charge carrier density in the channel and thus reduced saturation
velocity due to carrier-carrier scattering.

In the presence of strong electronic spin correlations, the hyperfine
interaction imparts long-range coupling between nuclear spins. Efficient
protocols for the extraction of such complex information about electron
correlations via magnetic response are not well known. Here, we study how
machine learning can extract material parameters and help interpret magnetic
response experiments. A low-dimensional representation that classifies the
total interaction strength is discovered by unsupervised learning. Supervised
learning generates models that predict the spatial extent of electronic
correlations and the total interaction strength. Our work demonstrates the
utility of artificial intelligence in the development of new probes of quantum
systems, with applications to experimental studies of strongly correlated
materials.

We extend previous results providing an exact formula for the variance of a
linear statistic for the Jellium model, a one-dimensional model of Statistical
mechanics obtained from the $k \longrightarrow 0^{+}$ limit of the Dyson
log-gas. For such a computation of the covariance, in comparison to previous
work for computations of the log-gas covariance, we obtain a formula between
two linear statistics, given arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$ over the real
line, that is dependent upon an asymptotic approximation of the Jellium
probability distribution function from large $N$ deviations, and from an
effective saddle-point action.

An effective computational framework of an anisotropic phase field model is
used to explore the effects of interface properties, effective critical energy
release rates and hole shapes on the failure process of fibre-reinforced
composites in this paper. In this framework, the phase field method is solved
under the background of the finite element method, and the influence of strong
and weak interfaces on the failure strength of composite materials is studied.
The results show that when the material fails, the strong interface shows
brittleness, and the weak interface shows toughness, which can improve the
failure strength of the material. At the same time, the effective critical
energy release rate is introduced in the calculation, which reduces the
fracture toughness of the material, makes the prediction results more
consistent with the experimental results, and improves the accuracy of the
results. The effect of hole shapes on the failure of the composites is also
explored, and the crack propagation of different hole shapes is captured, which
shows that the bearing capacity of a plate with a hole is not only related to
the shape of the hole but also related to the location of the hole concentrated
stress and the number of locations where the hole bears the load. The bearing
capacity of the material can be improved by changing the shape of the hole.
These results reveal the influence of different factors on the failure of
composites and lay a foundation for the effective design of composites.

Recent observation of superconducting diodes generalizes the category of the
conventional electrical nonreciprocal phenomenon to the superconducting regime.
The diode efficiency is commonly controlled by an external magnetic field which
could, however, compromise the superconductivity of the system. In this work,
we propose a concept of an all-electrical topological Josephson diode (TJD) in
a time-reversal broken quantum spin Hall insulator hosting anisotropic helical
edge states. Due to the edge states anisotropy and helicity, the
electrostatic-induced Doppler energy shift results in a novel diode operation
with a topologically protected maximal efficiency of $40\%$ in a single edge
setup which can be further boosted to $90\%$ in a double-edge interferometer
setup. Importantly, the diode operates in an all-electrical fashion, in which
the efficiency and polarity can be efficiently modulated by an electrostatic
gate voltage. The proposed gate-tunable TJD is within the current experimental
reaches and shall offer useful building blocks for \emph{topological
superelectronics} that synergizes topological materials, superconductivity, and
nonreciprocal quantum transport.

Dirac node lines (DNLs) are characterized by Dirac-type linear crossings
between valence and conduction bands along one-dimensional node lines in the
Brillouin zone (BZ). Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) usually shifts the degeneracy at
the crossings thus destroys DNLs, and so far the reported DNLs in a few
materials are categorized as non-interacting type, making the search for robust
interacting DNLs in real materials appealing. Here, via first-principle
calculations, we reveal that Kondo interaction together with nonsymmorphic
lattice symmetries can drive a robust interacting DNLs in a Kondo semimetal
CePt$_2$Si$_2$, and the feature of DNLs can be significantly manipulated by
Kondo behavior in different temperature regions. Based on the density function
theory combining dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), we predict a
transition to Kondo-coherent state at coherent temperature
$T_{\mathrm{coh}}\approx$ 80 K upon cooling, verified by temperature dependence
of Ce-4$f$ self-energy, Kondo resonance peak, magnetic susceptibility and
momentum-resolved spectral. Below $T_{\mathrm{coh}}$, well-resolved narrow
heavy-fermion bands emerge near the Fermi level, constructing clearly
visualized heavy DNLs locating at the BZ boundary. In contrast, above a
crossover temperature $T_{\mathrm{KS}}\approx$ 600 K, the destruction of local
Kondo screening drives non-interacting DNLs which are comprised by light
conduction electrons at the same location. These DNLs are protected by lattice
nonsymmorphic symmetries thus robust under intrinsic strong SOC. Our proposal
of DNLs which can be significantly manipulated according to Kondo behavior
provides an unique realization of interacting Dirac semimetals in real
strongly-correlated materials, and serves as a convenient platform to
investigate the effect of electronic correlations on topological materials.

In this work, we theoretically study the thermoelectric properties of a
graphene quantum dot array (GQDA) with line and surface contacted metal
electrodes. Such GQDAs are realized by zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with
periodic vacancies. The gaps and minibands are formed in these GQDAs, which
could have metallic and semiconducting phases. The electronic states of first
conduction (valence) miniband with nonlinear dispersion could remain very long
coherent lengths along the zigzag edge direction. In the line contacted metal
electrodes, the GQDAs show the characteristic of serially coupled QDs (SCQDs)
when the armchair edge atoms of ZGNRs are coupled to the electrodes. On the
other hand, the GQDAs show the characteristic of parallel QDs when the zigzag
edge atoms are coupled to the electrodes. The maximum thermoelectric power
factors of SCQDs with different line contacted electrodes such as $Cu$, $Au$,
$Pt$, $Pd$ and $Ti$ at room temperature are very close and beyond $0.186nW/K$,
while their figure of merits are larger than three. The thermoelectric
performance of a GQDA with line contacted metal electrodes is much better than
that with surface contacted metal electrodes.

The intercalated iron selenide (Li,Fe)OHFeSe has a strongly layered structure
analogous to the quasi two-dimensional (2D) bismuth cuprate superconductors,
and exhibits both high-temperature (Tc) and topological superconductivity.
However, the issue of its superconductivity dimensionality has not yet been
fully investigated so far. Here we report that the quasi-2D superconductivity
features, including the high anisotropy {\gamma} = 151 and the associated
quasi-2D vortices, are also revealed for (Li,Fe)OHFeSe, based on systematic
experiments of the electrical transport and magnetization and model fittings.
Thus, we establish a new vortex phase diagram for (Li,Fe)OHFeSe, which
delineates an emergent quasi-2D vortex-liquid state, and a subsequent
vortex-solid dimensional crossover from a pancake-like to a three-dimensional
state with decreasing temperature and magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that
all the quasi-2D characteristics revealed here for the high-Tc iron selenide
superconductor are very similar to those reported for the high-Tc bismuth
cuprate superconductors.

<br>
The effects of adsorption of Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules on the
superconductivity of the Si(111)-(root7xroot3)-In surface are studied through
transport measurements under ultrahigh vacuum environment. The ZnPc molecules
are found to increase the transition temperature Tc by 11% at maximum, which is
about 2.7 times the Tc increase previously reported using CuPc. By contrast,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and ab initio
calculations show that charge transfer from the In atomic layers to ZnPc is
substantially smaller than that to CuPc. This clearly shows that charge
transfer should be excluded as the origin of the increase in Tc. The push-back
effect induced by physical adsorption of molecules is discussed as a possible
mechanism for the Tc enhancement.

A compound with metallic electrical conductivity usually has a considerable
total thermal conductivity because both electrons and photons contribute to
thermal transport. Here, we show an exceptional example of iridium oxide,
Bi3Ir3O11, that concurrently displays metallic electrical conductivity and
ultralow thermal conductivity approaching 0.61 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K. The compound
crystallizes into a cubic structural framework with space group Pn-3. The edge-
and corner-sharing IrO6 octahedra with a mixed Ir4.33+ charge state favor
metallic electrical transport. Bi3Ir3O11 exhibits an extremely low lattice
thermal conductivity close to the minimum limit in theory owing to its
tunnel-like structure with filled heavy atoms Bi rattling inside. Theoretical
calculations reveal the underlying mechanisms for the extraordinary
compatibility between metallic electrical conductivity and ultralow thermal
conductivity. This study may establish a new avenue for designing and
developing unprecedented heat-insulation metals.

We demonstrate a new substrate cleaning and buffer growth scheme in
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial thin films using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy
(MOVPE). For the channel structure, a low-temperature (LT, 600 $^\circ$C)
undoped Ga$_2$O$_3$ buffer is grown followed by transition layers to a
high-temperature (HT, 810 $^\circ$C) Si-doped Ga$_2$O$_3$ channel layers
without growth interruption. The (010) Ga$_2$O$_3$ Fe-doped substrate cleaning
uses solvent cleaning followed by an additional HF (49% in water) treatment for
30 mins before the epilayer growth. This step is shown to compensate the
parasitic Si channel at the epilayer-substrate interface that originates from
the substrate polishing process or contamination from the ambient. SIMS
analysis shows the Si peak atomic density at the substrate interface is several
times lower than the Fe atomic density in the substrate - indicating full
compensation. The elimination of the parasitic electron channel at the
epi-substrate interface was also verified by electrical (capacitance-voltage
profiling) measurements. In the LT-grown buffer layers, it is seen that the Fe
forward decay tail from the substrate is very sharp with a decay rate of $\sim$
9 nm$/$dec. These channels show record high electron mobility in the range of
196 - 85 cm$^2$/Vs in unintentionally doped and Si-doped films in the doping
range of 2$\times$10$^{16}$ to 1$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. Si delta-doped
channels were also grown utilizing this substrate cleaning and the hybrid
LT-buffers. Record high electron Hall mobility of 110 cm$^2$/Vs was measured
for sheet charge density of 9.2$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. This substrate
cleaning combined with the LT-buffer scheme shows the potential of designing
Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ channels with exceptional transport properties for
high performance gallium oxide-based electron devices.

Spin-triplet superconductors are novel materials capable of harboring
Majorana bound states that can be used in topological quantum computing.
However, such bulk materials are still rare. Here we review the results that
established K2Cr3As3 as a spin-triplet superconductor with transition
temperature T_c as high as 6.5 K. We focus on the multiple-phases feature, and
its exquisite distance to a ferromagnetic quantum critical point which is
likely responsible for the high T_c. We touch on the topological aspect of the
superconducting state, and suggest that it is a new route to the technical
implementation using a topological spin-triplet superconductor at the highest
temperature ever.

<h3>Tuning topological phases in N-stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains by  systematic breaking of symmetries</h3>

<i>Aayushi Agrawal, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay</i>
<br>
<br>
A two-dimensional (2D) model of topological insulator with N-stacked
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains is proposed. This study considers a basic
model with all the fundamental symmetries (particle-hole, chiral, and
time-reversal) preserved. This model is topologically trivial irrespective of
the topological property of the individual SSH chain. In order to introduce
nontrivial topology in the system, we need to break some of these system
symmetries. The symmetries are systematically broken by tuning the basic model
with the introduction of different hopping terms. The Chern number (C) is used
here as a topological invariant of the system. Our study reveals that a minimum
requirement for the induction of the nontrivial topology in the system is to
break the chiral and the time-reversal (TR) symmetry. The chiral symmetry is
broken by introducing intra-sub-lattice hopping in the system. Following
Haldane, the same intra-sub-lattice hopping strengths are considered imaginary
to break the TR-symmetry in the system. In this study, we preserve the
particle-hole symmetry in the system. The presence of this symmetry in the
system facilitates an analytical calculation of the Chern number. We
numerically observe that this model exhibits nontrivial topology with only |C|
= 1. This result is justified by an analytical calculation of the Chern number.
The same analytical formalism is used to study the topological phase transition
in the system.

introduce a new `decimation' scheme that maps it to neural network models of
associative memory and provide a detailed theoretical analysis of its
performance, showing that decimation is able to factorize extensive-rank

based on ground-state search of the neural network, which shows performances
that match the theoretical prediction.

Modification of physical properties of materials and design of materials with
on-demand characteristics is at the heart of modern technology. Rare
application relies on pure materials--most devices and technologies require
careful design of materials properties through alloying, creating
heterostructures of composites or controllable introduction of defects. At the
same time, such designer materials are notoriously difficult for modelling.
Thus, it is very tempting to apply machine learning methods for such systems.
Unfortunately, there is only a handful of machine learning-friendly material
databases available these days. We develop a platform for easy implementation
of machine learning techniques to materials design and populate it with
datasets on pristine and defected materials. Here we describe datasets of
defects in represented 2D materials such as MoS2, WSe2, hBN, GaSe, InSe, and
black phosphorous, calculated using DFT. Our study provides a data-driven
physical understanding of complex behaviors of defect properties in 2D
materials, holding promise for a guide to the development of efficient machine
learning models. In addition, with the increasing enrollment of datasets, our
database could provide a platform for designing of materials with predetermined
properties.

<br>
We investigate the effects of random onsite disorder on higher-order Thouless
pumping of noninteracting fermionic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) model. The
interplay of disorderinduced topological phase transition and
delocalization-localization transition is extensively explored. The
higher-order Thouless pumping is characterized by the quantized
corner-to-corner charge transport and nonzero Chern number, and the
delocalization-localization transition is analyzed by utilizing both inverse
participation ratio and energy-level statistics. The results show that the
quantized corner-to-corner charge transport is broken in the strong disorder,
where the instantaneous bulk energy gap is closed due to effects of disorder.
While, although the instantaneous eigenstates are localized, the charge
transport remains quantized. This is attributed to delocalized Floquet states
caused by the periodic driving. Furthermore, the phase transition from the
quantized charge transport to topologically trivial pumping is accompanied by
the disorder-induced delocalization-localization transition of Floquet states.

gas). An integral formula for the covariance of single-particle operators is
obtained which generalizes known results in the limits $s\rightarrow -1$
(Coulomb gas) and $s\rightarrow 0$ (log-gas). As an application, we calculate
the variance of the center of mass of the Riesz gas, which has a universal
large-$N$ limit that does not depend on the shape of the confining potential.

The observation of a sizable anomalous Hall effect in magnetic materials with
vanishing magnetization has renewed interest in understanding and engineering
this phenomenon. Antiferromagnetic antiperovskites are one of emerging material
classes that exhibit a variety of interesting properties owing to a complex
electronic band structure and magnetic ordering. Reports on the anomalous
Nernst effect and its magnitude in this class of materials are, however, very
limited. This scarcity may be partly due to the experimental difficulty of
reliably quantifying the anomalous Nernst coefficient. Here, we report
experiments on the anomalous Nernst effect in antiferromagnetic antiperovskite
Mn$_3$NiN thin films. Measurement of both the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects
using the same sample and measurement geometry makes it possible to directly
compare these two effects and quantify the anomalous Nernst coefficient and
conductivity in Mn$_3$NiN. We carefully evaluate the spatial distribution of
the thermal gradient in the sample and use finite element modeling to
corroborate our experimental results.

Nonreciprocal plasmonics enables one-way light propagation at the nanoscale
and it is an essential building block for photonics applications. Here, we
explore intrinsic nonreciprocity in bulk plasmon propagation based on
underlying symmetries. We demonstrate that the interband, as well as the
intraband bulk plasmon modes, follow asymmetric dispersion depending on the
sign of the wavevector for systems with broken inversion and time-reversal
symmetry. We show that the nonreciprocity in the interband plasmon dispersion
is dictated by the quantum metric connection, which is a band geometric
quantity. The intrinsic nonreciprocity in bulk intraband plasmon dispersion is
dictated by the quantum metric dipole and a higher-order `Drude' weight-like
term. We corroborate our findings via explicit numerical calculations for the
two-dimensional Qi-Wu-Zhang model and demonstrate the existence of intrinsic
nonreciprocal intraband and interband plasmon modes in moire systems such as
twisted bilayer graphene.

Confinement of filamentary objects is ubiquitous in numerous biological,
medical, and engineering scenarios. Quantitatively determining the mechanical
interaction between flexible filaments and surface confinement is particularly
challenging due to the unknown contact force induced by elasticity interacting
with geometric constraints. Here, we consider a simplified model of confined
filamentary object: an elastic curve under surface confinement. Local force and
moment balance equation incorporating the role of contact is utilized to derive
the contact force exerted by surface on the confined elastic curve. It reveals
the relation between contact force and local geometry at balanced state and
provides a route to obtain the contact force from local confined geometry
directly. Examples are provided to illustrate how to calculate contact force
from obtained geometries. We believe that our results contribute to future
efforts in the mechanics of filamentary objects under surface confinement.

The dynamics of a tagged particle immersed in a fluid of particles of the
same size but different mass is studied when the system is confined between two
hard parallel plates separated a distance smaller than twice the diameter of
the particles. The collisions between particles are inelastic while the
collisions of the particles with the hard walls inject energy in the direction
perpendicular to the wall, so that stationary states can be reached in the
long-time limit. The velocity distribution of the tagged particle verifies a
Boltzmann-Lorentz-like equation that is solved assuming that it is a spatially
homogeneous gaussian distribution with two different temperatures (one
associated to the motion parallel to the wall and another associated to the
perpendicular direction). It is found that the temperature perpendicular to the
wall diverges when the tagged particle mass approaches a critical mass from
below, while the parallel temperature remains finite. Molecular Dynamics
simulation results agree very well with the theoretical predictions for tagged
particle masses below the critical mass. The measurements of the velocity
distribution function of the tagged particle confirm that it is gaussian if the
mass is not close to the critical mass, while it deviates from gaussianity when
approaching the critical mass. Above the critical mass, the velocity
distribution function is very far from a gaussian, being the marginal
distribution in the perpendicular direction bimodal and with a much larger
variance than the one in the parallel direction.

The research interest in the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) has been
growing. It has been found in various kinds of systems, in a large part of
which it may be understood by combining spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field.
Here, we show that there exists another mechanism of generating SDE in chiral
nanotubes that trap magnetic fluxes, without spin-orbit coupling or Zeeman
field. We further show that the same generalized Ginzburg-Landau theory leads
to nonreciprocal paraconductivity (NPC) near the transition temperature. The
main features of both the SDE and the NPC are revealed by their parameter
dependence. Our study suggests a new kind of platforms to explore nonreciprocal
properties of superconducting materials. It also provides a theoretical link
between the SDE and the NPC, which were often studied separately.

The heat-treated oxyfluoride glasses with different contents of thulium Tm3+
and holmium Ho3+ ions have been studied using small-angle X-ray scattering and
diffraction. With an increase in relative concentration of added Ho2O3 and
Tm2O3 oxides, the growing in the average size of both nanoparticles and local
density fluctuations in the glass matrix is observed. In addition, at high
relative concentrations of initial rare-earth oxides, the appearance of a
crystalline cubic phase PbF2:Tm-Ho is observed, which can provide a source of
up-conversion luminescence in the studied glass materials. A change in the
concentration of the initial Ho2O3 and Tm2O3 oxides does not effect on a
morphology and fractal dimension of the formed luminescence nanoparticles. The
structural aspects of nanoparticle formation with up-conversion luminescence
phenomenon are discussed.

<h3>Infinite ergodicity for geometric Brownian motion</h3>

Geometric Brownian motion is an exemplary stochastic processes obeying
multiplicative noise, with widespread applications in several fields, e.g. in
finance, in physics and biology. The definition of the process depends
crucially on the interpretation of the stochastic integrals which involves the
discretization parameter $\alpha$ with $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ , giving rise to
the well-known special cases $\alpha=0$ (It\^{o}), $\alpha=1/2$
(Fisk-Stratonovich) and $\alpha=1$ (H\"{a}nggi-Klimontovich or anti-It\^{o}).
In this paper we study the asymptotic limits of the probability distribution
functions (PDFs) of geometric Brownian motion and some related generalizations.
We establish the conditions for the existence of normalizable asymptotic
distributions depending on the discretization parameter $\alpha$. Using the
infinite ergodicity approach, recently applied to stochastic processes with
multiplicative noise by E. Barkai and collaborators, we show how meaningful
asymptotic results can be formulated in a transparent way.

<h3>Wire width and density dependence of the crossover in the peak of the  static structure factor from $2k_\text{F}$ $\rightarrow$ $4k_\text{F}$ in  one-dimensional paramagnetic electron gases</h3>

We use the variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) method to study the wire
width ($b$) and electron density ($r_\text{s}$) dependences of the ground-state
properties of quasi-one-dimensional paramagnetic electron fluids. The onset of
a quasi-Wigner crystal phase is known to depend on electron density, and the
crossover occurs in the low density regime. We study the effect of wire width
on the crossover of the dominant peak in the static structure factor from
$k=2k_\text{F}$ to $k=4k_\text{F}$. It is found that for a fixed electron
density, in the charge structure factor the crossover from the dominant peak
occurring at $2k_\text{F}$ to $4k_\text{F}$ occurs as the wire width decreases.
Our study suggests that the crossover is due to interplay of both $r_\text{s}$
and $b<r_\text{s}$. The finite wire width correlation effect is reflected in
the peak height of the charge and spin structure factors. We fit the dominant
peaks of the charge and spin structure factors assuming fit functions based on
our finite wire width theory and clues from bosonization, resulting in a good
fit of the VMC data. The pronounced peaks in the charge and spin structure
factors at $4 k_\text{F}$ and $2 k_\text{F}$, respectively, indicate the
complete decoupling of the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the
wire width dependence of the electron correlation energy and the
Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter $K_{\rho}$ is found to be significant.

A short superconducting segment can couple attached quantum dots via elastic
co-tunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). Such coupled quantum
dots can host Majorana bound states provided that the ratio between CAR and ECT
can be controlled. Metallic superconductors have so far been shown to mediate
such tunneling phenomena, albeit with limited tunability. Here we show that
Andreev bound states formed in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures
can mediate CAR and ECT over mesoscopic length scales. Andreev bound states
possess both an electron and a hole component, giving rise to an intricate
interference phenomenon that allows us to tune the ratio between CAR and ECT
deterministically. We further show that the combination of intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling in InSb nanowires and an applied magnetic field provides another
efficient knob to tune the ratio between ECT and CAR and optimize the amount of
coupling between neighboring quantum dots.

Taking into account strong polymer concentration fluctuations and
electrostatic correlations of charged groups of dipolar monomeric units of
flexible polymer chains within the random phase approximation, we develop a
molecular theory of self-coacervation in semi-dilute zwitterionic polymer
solutions. We show that the interplay between these key features of such system
can result in two qualitatively different coacervation regimes. In the first
regime, where the electrostatic correlations are reduced to the effective
Keesom attraction of the point-like dipoles, located on the monomeric units,
the polymer concentration in the coacervate phase $c\sim 1/T^8$, while in the
second regime, where the electrostatic correlations are described within the
Debye-Hueckel theory, $c\sim 1/T^2$. According to the Lifshitz hypothesis of
$"$disconnected$"$ monomers, we establish that in the regime of semi-dilute
polymer solution, chain connectivity has an extremely weak effect on the
electrostatic interactions of the dipolar monomeric units, i.e. their
contribution to the total free energy can be described as the contribution of a
fluid of unbounded dipolar particles. The predicted high thermal sensitivity of
the coacervate polymer number density (or size of coacervate droplets) can be
used to control purification of macromolecular solutions by the uptake of
target biomacromolecules (liposomes and vesicles, for instance) by the
zwitterionic coacervate droplets.

Semiconductor spin qubits offer a unique opportunity for scalable quantum
computation by leveraging classical transistor technology. Hole spin qubits
benefit from fast all-electrical qubit control and sweet spots to counteract
charge and nuclear spin noise. The demonstration of a two-qubit quantum gate in
a silicon fin field-effect transistor, that is, the workhorse device of today's
semiconductor industry, has remained an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate a
controlled rotation two-qubit gate on hole spins in an industry-compatible
device. A short gate time of 24 ns is achieved. The quantum logic exploits an
exchange interaction that can be tuned from above 500 MHz to close-to-off.
Significantly, the exchange is strikingly anisotropic. By developing a general
theory, we show that the anisotropy arises as a consequence of a strong
spin-orbit interaction. Upon tunnelling from one quantum dot to the other, the
spin is rotated by almost 90 degrees. The exchange Hamiltonian no longer has
Heisenberg form and is engineered in such a way that there is no trade-off
between speed and fidelity of the two-qubit gate. This ideal behaviour applies
over a wide range of magnetic field orientations rendering the concept robust
with respect to variations from qubit to qubit. Our work brings hole spin
qubits in silicon transistors a step closer to the realization of a large-scale
quantum computer.

A nanoscale dielectric gap clamped between two metal electrodes may undergo a
large resistance change from insulating to highly conducting upon applying an
electrical stress. This sudden resistive switching effect is largely exploited
in memristors for emulating synapses in neuromorphic neural networks. Here, we
show that resistive switching can be accompanied by a release of
electromagnetic radiation spanning the visible spectral region. Importantly, we
find that the spectrum is characterized by photon energies exceeding the
maximum kinetic energy of electrons provided by the switching voltage. This
so-called overbias emission can be described self-consistently by a thermal
radiation model featuring an out-of-equilibrium electron distribution generated
in the device with an effective temperature exceeding 2000~K. The emitted
spectrum is understood in terms of hot electrons radiatively decaying to
resonant optical modes occurring in a nanoscale \ch{SiO2} matrix located
between two \ch{Ag} electrodes. The correlation between resistive switching and
the onset of overbias emission in atomic-scale photonic memristor brings new
venues to generate light on chip and their exploitation in optical
interconnects. Photons emitted during memristive switching can also be
monitored to follow the neural activation pathways in memristor-based networks.

Preparation of quantum states is of vital importance for performing quantum
computations and quantum simulations. In this work, we propose a general
framework for preparing ground states of many-body systems by combining the
measurement-feedback control process (MFCP) and the machine learning method.
Using the Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy, the efficiency of determining
the measurement and feedback operators in the MFCP is demonstrated. Taking the
one dimensional Bose-Hubbard model as an example, we show that BO can generate
optimal parameters, although constrained by the operator basis, which can drive
the system to the low energy state with high probability in typical quantum
trajectories.

<h3>Skyrmion inertia in synthetic antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02342" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02342</a>
<br>
<i>Sujit Panigrahy, Sougata Mallick, Joao Sampaio, Stanislas Rohart</i>
<br>
<br>
We describe the dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets
(SAF), with a finite interlayer coupling. Due to the opposite gyrovector of the
skyrmions in the two SAF layers, the coupled skyrmions reach a stationary
regime with a spatial separation, in a direction orthogonal to their velocity.
As a consequence, and contrary to the ferromagnetic situation, a transient
regime necessarily occurs, with a finite acceleration, related to an inertia,
and that limits its time response. The formalism developed here, based on two
coupled Thiele equations, allows a quantitative description of this phenomenon.
The time constant associated to the transient regime scales inversely with the
antiferromagnetic coupling constant. We also show that the coupling force
reaches a maximal value at a finite skyrmion separation. This sets a maximum
velocity limit, beyond which the the coupling force cannot stabilize the bound
state.

<br>
<br>
We study the stabilization and electrical manipulation of skyrmions in
magnetic ultrathin films in the absence of an applied magnetic field. We show
that this requires an increased magnetic anisotropy, controlled by the sample
thickness, as compared to usual skyrmionic samples, so that the uniform state
corresponds to the zero field ground state and the skyrmions to metastable
excitations. Although skyrmion stabilization at zero field is demonstrated over
a broad range of thicknesses, electrical control appeared to be more demanding
to avoid skyrmion deformation. In the thinnest samples, the large magnetic
anisotropy prevents skyrmion deformations and we show that they can be
nucleated progressively by current pulses, which underlines that the only
possible transition occurs between uniform and skyrmion states. The solitonic
skyrmions in zero applied magnetic field have the same properties as compared
to field stabilized ones, with a long-term stability and high mobility when
excited by a spin-orbit torque.

<h3>Effects of the interplay between fermionic interactions and disorders in  the nodal-line superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02356" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02356</a>

<br>
<br>
We study the interplay between fermion-fermion interactions and disorder
scatterings beneath the superconducting dome of noncentrosymmetric nodal-line
superconductors. With the application of renormalization group, several
interesting low-energy behaviors are extracted from the coupled equations of
all interaction parameters. At the clean limit, fermion-fermion interactions
decrease with lowering the energy scales but conversely fermion velocities
climb up and approach certain saturated values. This yields a slight decrease
or increase of the anisotropy of fermion velocities depending upon their
initial ratio. After bringing out four kinds of disorders designated by the
random charge ($\Delta_{1}$), random mass ($\Delta_{2}$), random axial chemical
potential ($\Delta_{3}$), and spin-orbit scatterers ($\Delta_{4}$) based on
their own unique features, we begin with presenting the distinct low-energy
fates of these disorders. For the presence of sole disorder, its strength
becomes either relevant ($\Delta_{1,4}$) or irrelevant($\Delta_{2,3}$) in the
low-energy regime. However, the competition for multiple sorts of disorders is
capable of qualitatively reshaping the low-energy properties of disorders
$\Delta_{2,3,4}$. Besides, it can generate an initially absent disorder as long
as two of $\Delta_{1,2,3}$ are present. In addition, the fermion-fermion
couplings are insensitive to the presence of $\Delta_4$ but rather
substantially modified by $\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$, or $\Delta_3$, and evolve
towards zero or certain finite non-zero values under the coexistence of
distinct disorders. Furthermore, the fermion velocities flow towards certain
finite saturated value for the only presence of $\Delta_{2,3}$ and vanish for
all other situations. As to their ratio, it acquires a little increase once the
disorder is subordinate to fermionic interactions, otherwise keeps some fixed
constant.

<h3>Superconductivity in Te-deficient ZrTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present structural, electrical, and thermal power measurements on
high-quality single crystals of ZrTe$_{1.8}$ grown from isothermal chemical
vapor transport. Our results show that the Te-deficient ZrTe$_{1.8}$, which
forms with the same structure of the non-superconducting ZrTe$_2$, is
superconducting below 3.2\,K. The temperature dependence of the upper critical
field (H$_{c2}$) deviates from the behavior expected in conventional
single-band superconductors, and it is best fit using a two-band model,
suggesting an electron-phonon two-gap superconducting state with strong
intraband coupling. For the ZrTe$_{1.8}$ single crystals, the measured Seebeck
coefficients demonstrate that the system is predominantly negatively charged,
in agreement with the ab initio calculations. Through first-principles
calculations within DFT, we show that the inclusion of Te vacancies in ZrTe$_2$
unexpectedly gives origin to a density of states peak at the Fermi level due to
the formation of localized Zr-$d$ bands, possibly promoting electronic
instabilities at the Fermi level and an increase at the critical temperature
according to the standard BCS theory. These findings highlight that the Te
deficiency promotes the electronic conditions for the stability of the
superconducting ground state, suggesting that the electronic structure can be
fine-tuned by defects to support superconductivity in TMDs.

Ferromagnets are known to support spin-polarized currents that control
various spin-dependent transport phenomena useful for spintronics. On the
contrary, fully compensated antiferromagnets are expected to support only
globally spin-neutral currents. Here, we demonstrate that these globally
spin-neutral currents can represent the N\'eel spin currents, i.e. staggered
spin currents flowing through different magnetic sublattices. The N\'eel spin
currents emerge in antiferromagnets with strong intra-sublattice coupling
(hopping) and drive the spin-dependent transport phenomena such as tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR) and spin-transfer torque (STT) in antiferromagnetic
tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). Using RuO$_{2}$ and Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ as
representative antiferromagnets, we predict that the N\'eel spin currents with
a strong staggered spin-polarization produce a sizable field-like STT capable
of the deterministic switching of the N\'eel vector in the associated AFMTJs.
Our work uncovers the previously unexplored potential of fully compensated
antiferromagnets and paves a new route to realize the efficient writing and
reading of information for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

<h3>Observation of ultraslow hole dynamics in the 3D topological insulator  Bi2Se3 coated with a thin MgF2 layer using multiphoton pumped UV-Vis  transient absorption spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Individual relaxation dynamics of electrons and holes in optically pumped
semiconductors is rarely observed due to their overlap. Here we report the
individual dynamics of long-lived (~200 mks) holes observed at room temperature
in a 10 nm thick film of the 3D topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 coated with a
10 nm thick MgF2 layer using transient absorption spectroscopy in the UV-Vis
region. The ultraslow hole dynamics was observed by applying multiphoton
resonant pumping of massless Dirac fermions and bound valence electrons in
Bi2Se3 at a certain wavelength sufficient for their photoemission and
subsequent trapping at the Bi2Se3/MgF2 interface. The emerging deficit of
electrons in the film makes it impossible for the remaining holes to recombine,
thus causing their ultraslow dynamics measured at a specific probing
wavelength. We also found an extremely long rise time (~600 ps) for this
ultraslow optical response, which is due to the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
splitting at the valence band maximum and the resulting intervalley scattering
between the splitting components. The ultraslow hole dynamics in Bi2Se3 due to
the presence of the Bi2Se3/MgF2 interface is nevertheless much faster than the
known ultraslow electron dynamics at the Si/SiO2 interface, also induced by
multiphoton excitation in Si. The observed dynamics of long-lived holes is
gradually suppressed with decreasing Bi2Se3 film thickness for the 2D TI Bi2Se3
(film thickness 5, 4, and 2 nm) due to the loss of resonance conditions for
multiphoton photoemission caused by the gap opening at the Dirac surface state
nodes. This behavior indicates that the dynamics of massive Dirac fermions
predominantly determines the relaxation of photoexcited carriers for both the
2D topologically nontrivial and 2D topologically trivial insulator phases.

We show that interlayer current induces topological superconductivity in
twisted bilayers of nodal superconductors. A bulk gap opens and achieves its
maximum near a ``magic'' twist angle $\theta_\mathrm{MA}$. Chiral edge modes
lead to a quantized thermal Hall effect at low temperatures. Furthermore, we
show that an in-plane magnetic field creates a periodic lattice of topological
domains with edge modes forming low-energy bands. We predict their signatures
in scanning tunneling microscopy. Estimates for candidate materials indicate
that twist angles $\theta\sim \theta_\mathrm{MA}$ are optimal for observing the
predicted effects.

<br>
There have been several proposals for platforms sustaining topological
superconductivity in high temperature superconductors, in order to make use of
the larger superconducting gap and the expected robustness of Majorana zero
modes towards perturbations. In particular, the iron-based materials offer
relatively large $T_c$ and nodeless energy gaps. In addition, atomically flat
surfaces enable the engineering of defect structures and the subsequent
measurement of spectroscopic properties to reveal topological aspects. From a
theory perspective, a materials-specific description is challenging due to the
correlated nature of the materials and complications arising from the multiband
nature of the electronic structure. Here we include both aspects in realistic
interacting models, and find that the correlations themselves can lead to local
magnetic order close to linear potential scattering defects at the surface of
the superconductor. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in a
real-space setup using a prototype electronic structure, we allow for arbitrary
magnetic orders and show how a topological superconducting state emerges. The
calculation of the topological invariant and the topological gap allows us to
map out the phase diagram for the case of a linear chain of potential
scatterers. While intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is not needed to enter the
topological state in presence of spin-spiral states, it enlarges the
topological phase. We discuss the interplay of a triplet component of the
superconducting order parameter and the spin spiral leading effectively to
extended spin orbit coupling terms, and connect our results to experimental
efforts on the Fe(Se,Te) system.

The classical Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer and Eliashberg theories of the
electron-phonon-mediated superconductivity are based on the Migdal theorem,
which is an assumption that the energy of charge carriers, $k{_B}T{_F}$,
significantly exceeds the phononic energy, $\hbar{\omega{_D}} $, of the
crystalline lattice. This assumption, which is also known as adiabatic
approximation, implies that the superconductor exhibits fast charge carriers
and slow phonons. This picture is valid for pure metals and metallic alloys
because these superconductors exhibit $\hbar{\omega{_D}}$/$k{_B}T{_F}<0.01$.
However, n-type doped semiconducting $SrTiO_3$ was the first superconductor
which beyond this adiabatic approximation, because this material exhibits
$\hbar{\omega{_D}}$/$k{_B}T{_F} $~$ 50$. There is growing number of newly
discovered superconductors which also beyond the adiabatic approximation. Here,
leaving apart pure theoretical aspects of nonadiabatic superconductors, we
classified major classes of superconductors (including, elements, A-15 and
Heusler alloys, Laves phases, intermetallics, noncentrosymmetric compounds,
cuprates, pnictides, highly-compressed hydrides and oxygen, and magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene) by the strength of nonadiabaticity (for which the
ratio of the Debye temperature to the Fermi temperature, $T{_\theta}/T{_F}$, is
used as a criterion for the nonadiabaticity) versus the superconducting
transition temperature, $T{_c}$. The discussion of this classification scheme
and its relation to other known classification counterparts is given.

Layered kagome-lattice materials with 3$d$ transition metals provide a
fertile playground for studies on geometry frustration, band topology and other
novel ordered states. A representative class of materials AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,
Rb, Cs) have been proved to possess various unconventional phases such as
superconductivity, non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ band topology, and electronic
nematicity, which are intertwined with multiple interlaced charge density waves
(CDW). However, the interplay among these novel states and their mechanisms are
still elusive. Recently, the discovery of isostructural titanium-based
single-crystals ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs), which demonstrate similar multiple
exotic states but in the absence of the concomitant intertwined CDW, has been
offering an ideal opportunity to disentangle these complex novel states in
kagome-lattice. Here, we combine the high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to systematically
investigate the low-lying electronic structure of RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$. For the first
time, we experimentally demonstrate the coexistence of flat bands and multiple
non-trivial topological states, including type-II Dirac nodal lines and
non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological surface states therein. Furthermore, our
findings as well provide the hint of rotation symmetry breaking in
RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$, suggesting the directionality of the electronic structure and
possibility of emerging pure electronic nematicity in this new family of kagome
compounds, which may provide important insights into the electronic nematic
phase in correlated kagome metals.

In atomistic simulations of solids, ability to classify crystal phases and
lattice defects in the presence of thermal fluctuations is essential for
gaining deeper insights into the simulated dynamics. The need for accurate and
efficient characterization methods is especially acute in presently emerging
large-scale simulations of multi-phase systems far from equilibrium. Taking the
perspective that delineating order and disorder features from ubiquitous
thermal vibrations is akin to extracting signal from noise, we consider
classification of ordered phases and identification of disordered crystal
defects to be fundamentally the same problem and address them both with a
unified approach: a denoising score function that removes thermal noise and
recovers any underlying crystalline order-disorder. Built on a rotationally
equivariant graph neural network (NequIP), the denoiser was trained entirely
with synthetically noised structures and requires no simulation data during
training. To demonstrate its denoising capabilities, the denoiser is shown to
effectively remove thermal vibrations of BCC, FCC, and HCP crystal structures
without impacting the underlying disordered defects, including point defects,
dislocations, grain boundaries, and liquid disorder. In particular the denoiser
was applied to two relatively complex MD simulations that present practical
challenges: a Cu solidification trajectory involving a polymorphic nucleus, and
a trajectory of BCC Ta undergoing plastic deformation resulting in dislocation
networks and point defect clusters. In both cases the denoiser facilitates or
trivializes the subsequent characterization of the order-disorder features.
Lastly, we outline future work to extend our denoising model to more complex
crystal structures and to multi-element systems.

are gapped out when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is included. These findings are
supported by explicit calculations of the Berry curvature and the Chern number.
The choice of the Hubbard-$U$ parameter to describe the $d$-electrons is
thoroughly discussed, as well as the influence of using a hybrid-functional
approach. The presence of band inversions and the associated topological
features are found to be formalism-dependent. Nevertheless, routes to achieve
the topological phase via the application of external biaxial strain are
demonstrated. Within the hybrid-functional picture, topological band structures
are recovered under a pressure of 15% (17 GPa). The present work provides a
potential avenue for uncovering new topological phases in metastable
ferromagnetic phases.

We show that NV centers could provide distinct signatures of emergent gauge
fields in certain phase transitions in spin liquids. We consider the relaxation
rate $1/T_1$ of a diamond NV center placed a distance $z_0$ above a crystal
consisting of two dimensional layers which hosts a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid
with spinon Fermi surface. We show that during a spinon pairing transition from
a $U(1)$ to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, the relaxation rate exhibits a rapid
fall just below the pairing transition. The drop is much faster than what can
be accounted for by the opening of the energy gap. Instead, the rapid fall with
a unique $z_0$ dependence of its height and width, is the signature of the
Meissner effect of the gauge field. We identify the organic ET compound which
has a phase transition at 6K as a candidate for the experimental observation of
this phenomenon.

In stacks of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers with arbitrary
twisting angles, we explore a new class of bright excitons arising from the
pronounced F\"{o}rster coupling, whose dimensionality is tuned by its in-plane
momentum. The low energy sector at small momenta is two-dimensional, featuring
a Mexican Hat dispersion, while the high energy sector at larger momenta
becomes three-dimensional (3D) with sizable group velocity both in-plane and
out-of-plane. By choices of the spacer thickness, interface exciton mode
strongly localized at designated layers can emerge out of the cross-dimensional
bulk dispersion for a topological origin. Step-edges in spacers can be
exploited for engineering lateral interfaces to enable interlayer communication
of the topological interface exciton. Combined with the polarization selection
rule inherited from the monolayer building block, these exotic exciton
properties open up new opportunities for multilayer design towards 3D
integration of valley exciton optoelectronics.

Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) states are recently discovered exotic states of
condensed matter. DHU systems are similar to liquids or glasses in that they
are statistically isotropic and lack conventional long-range translational and
orientational order. On the other hand, they completely suppress normalized
infinite-wavelength density fluctuations like crystals, and in this sense
possess a hidden long-range order. Very recently, there are several exciting
discoveries of disordered hyperuniformity in solid-state materials, including
amorphous carbon nanotubes, amorphous 2D silica, amorphous graphene, defected
transition metal dichalcogenides, defected pentagonal 2D materials, and
medium/high-entropy alloys. It has been found the DHU states of these materials
often possess a significantly lower energy than other disorder models, and can
lead to unique electronic and thermal transport properties, which resulted from
mechanisms distinct from those identified for their crystalline counterparts.
For example, DHU states can enhance electronic transport in 2D amorphous
silica; DHU medium/high-entropy alloys realize the Vegard's law, and possess
enhanced electronic band gaps and thermal transport at low temperatures. These
unique properties open up many promising potential device applications in
optoelectronics and thermoelectrics. Here, we provide a focused review on these
important new developments of hyperuniformity in solid-state materials, taking
an applied and ``materials'' perspective, which complements the existing
reviews on hyperuniformity in physical systems and photonic materials. Future
directions and outlook are also provided, with a focus on the design and
discovery of DHU quantum materials for quantum information science and
engineering.

We introduce a simplified method to model the interatomic interactions of
high entropy alloys based on a lookup table of cluster energies. These
interactions are employed in replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations with
histogram analysis to obtain thermodynamic properties across a broad
temperature range. Kikuchi's Cluster Variation Method entropy formalism and
high temperature series expansions are applied to directly calculate entropy
from statistics on short- and long-range chemical order, and we discuss the
convergence of the entropy as clusters of differing size are included.

<h3>Theoretical and computational analysis of the electrophoretic polymer  mobility inversion induced by charge correlations</h3>

Electrophoretic (EP) mobility reversal is commonly observed for strongly
charged macromolecules in multivalent salt solutions. This curious effect takes
place, e.g., when a charged polymer, such as DNA, adsorbs excess counterions so
that the counterion-dressed surface charge reverses its sign, leading to the
inversion of the polymer drift driven by an external electric field. In order
to characterize this seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon that cannot be
captured by electrostatic mean-field theories, we adapt here a previously
developed strong-coupling-dressed Poisson-Boltzmann approach to the cylindrical
geometry of the polyelectrolyte-salt system. Within the framework of this
formalism, we derive an analytical polymer mobility formula dressed by charge
correlations. In qualitative agreement with polymer transport experiments, this
mobility formula predicts that the increment of the monovalent salt, the
decrease of the multivalent counterion valency, and the increase of the
dielectric permittivity of the background solvent, suppress charge correlations
and increase the multivalent bulk counterion concentration required for EP
mobility reversal. These results are corroborated by coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulations showing how multivalent counterions induce mobility
inversion at dilute concentrations and suppress the inversion effect at large
concentrations. This re-entrant behavior, previously observed in the
aggregation of like-charged polymer solutions, calls for verification by
polymer transport experiments.

The coexistence of multiple ferroic order, i.e. multiferroicity, is a scarce
property to be found in materials. However, the applications derived from this
coexistence are promising in several fields, and motivates the search for new
and better multiferroics. Historically, this state has been found mainly in
3-dimensional complex oxides and perovskites, or in heterostructures of
ferroelectric/ferromagnetic thin-films, but so far this state has still been
elusive for the most widely studied and characterized family of 2D compounds,
the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), in spite of numerous theoretical
predictions in this respect. In this study, we report the first experimental
realization of multiferroic states in TMDs, at room temperature, in bulk single
crystals of Te-doped WSe2. We observe the coexistence of ferromagnetism and
ferroelectricity, evidenced in the presence of magnetization and piezoresponse
force microscopy (PFM) hysteresis loops, resistive switching effects, and
substantial piezoelectricity with higher effective coefficients than previously
reported in any other TMD. These findings open the possibility of widening the
use and study of Van der Waals-based multifunctional devices for new
nanoelectronic and spintronic applications, and provide an affordable platform
for the study of fundamental physics of ferroic orders on low-dimensional
compounds.

The propagation of spin waves in magnetically ordered systems has emerged as
a potential means to shuttle quantum information over large distances.
Conventionally, the arrival time of a spin wavepacket at a distance, $d$, is
assumed to be determined by its group velocity, $v_g$. He we report
time-resolved optical measurements of wavepacket propagation in the Kagome
ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ that demonstrate the arrival of spin information at
times significantly less than $d/v_g$. We show that this spin wave "precursor"
originates from the interaction of light with the unusual spectrum of
magnetostatic modes in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$. Related effects may have far-reaching
consequences toward realizing long-range, ultrafast spin wave transport in both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems.
