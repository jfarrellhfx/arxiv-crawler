<h3>Emerging universality classes in thermally-assisted activation of  interacting diffusive systems: A perturbative hydrodynamic approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05839" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05839</a>
<br>
<i>Vishwajeet Kumar, Arnab Pal, Ohad Shpielberg</i>
<p>Thermal activation of a particle from a deep potential trap follows the
Arrhenius law. Recently, this result was generalized for interacting diffusive
particles in the trap, revealing two universality classes -- the Arrhenius
class and the excluded volume class. The result was demonstrated with the aid
of numerical analysis. Here, we present a perturbative hydrodynamic approach to
analytically validate the existence and range of validity for the two
universality classes.

<h3>Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in  the electron hydrodynamic regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375</a>
<br>
<i>Nisarg Chadha, Subroto Mukerjee</i>
<p>We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving
electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in
well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity
equations. Studying semiclassical thermoelectric transport in the presence of a
Berry curvature, we find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat
transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field. These
contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking centro-symmetry, and the
corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager
reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating
the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with
the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of the charge density
and the entropy density with the momentum density. The requirement of the lack
of centrosymmetry is shown to arise as a consequence of the Curie symmetry
principle, which prevents cross-tensor effects in isotropic systems.

<h3>A Stochastic Simulation Method for Fractional Order Compartment Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05268</a>
<br>
<i>Zhuang Xu, Christopher N. Angstmann, Daniel S. Han, Stuart-James Burney, Bruce I. Henry, Byron A. Jacobs</i>
<p>Fractional order compartment models derived from an underlying physical
stochastic process introduce a more nuanced and phenomenological approach to
system modelling than compartment models obtained by replacing integer order
derivatives with fractional order derivatives. In these models, inherent
stochasticity becomes important, particularly when dealing with the dynamics of
small populations; far from the continuum limit of large particle numbers. The
need for stochastic simulations is motivated by such deviations from mean
states of governing equations. This work presents an exact stochastic
simulation algorithm designed for fractional order compartment models, based on
a semi-Markov process. We have considered a fractional re-susceptibility
epidemic model as an illustrative example, highlighting pronounced disparities
between deterministic and stochastic dynamics when the total population is
small. Beyond this singular example, the algorithm presented is a general tool
for modelling fractional order differential equations via Monte Carlo
simulations.

<h3>Effects of Grain Boundaries and Surfaces on Electronic and Mechanical  Properties of Solid Electrolytes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05294" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05294</a>
<br>
<i>Weihang Xie, Zeyu Deng, Zhengyu Liu, Theodosios Famprikis, Keith T. Butler, Pieremanuele Canepa</i>
<p>Extended defects, including exposed surfaces and grain boundaries, are
fundamental in the properties of polycrystalline solid electrolytes in
all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). These defects can significantly alter the
mechanical and electronic properties of solid electrolytes, with direct
manifestations on the performance of ASSBs. Here, by building a library of 590
surfaces and grain boundaries of 11 relevant solid electrolytes, including
halides, oxides, and sulfides, their electronic, mechanical, and thermodynamic
characteristics are linked to the functional properties of polycrystalline
solid electrolytes. It is found that the energy required to mechanically
''separate'' grain boundaries can be significantly lower than in the bulk
region of materials, which can trigger preferential cracking of solid
electrolyte particles in the grain boundary regions. The brittleness of many
oxides solid electrolytes, such as $\mathrm{Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}}$ and
$\mathrm{Na_3Zr_2Si_2PO_{12}}$ contribute to their cracking under local
pressure of Lithium or Sodium penetration in their grain boundaries. Extended
defects of solid electrolytes introduce new electronic ''interfacial'' states
within bandgaps of solid electrolytes. These interfacial states alter and
possibly increase locally the availability of free electrons and holes in solid
electrolytes. Factoring effects arising from extended defects appear crucial to
explain electro -chemical and -mechanical observations in ASSBs.

<h3>Strontium Ferrite Under Pressure: Potential Analogue to Strontium  Ruthenate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05314" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05314</a>
<br>
<i>Azin Kazemi-Moridani, Sophie Beck, Alexander Hampel, A.-M. S. Tremblay, Michel Côté, Olivier Gingras</i>
<p>Despite the significant attention it has garnered over the last thirty years,
the paradigmatic material strontium ruthenate remains the focus of critical
questions regarding strongly correlated materials. As an alternative platform
to unravel some of its perplexing characteristics, we propose to study the
isostructural and more correlated material strontium ferrite. Using density
functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory, we attribute the
experimentally observed insulating behavior at zero pressure to strong local
electronic correlations generated by Mott and Hund's physics. At high pressure,
our simulations reproduce the reported insulator-to-metal transition around 18
GPa. Along with distinctive features of a Hund's metal, the resulting metallic
state is found to display an electronic structure analogous to that of
strontium ruthenate, suggesting that it could exhibit similar low-energy
properties.

<h3>Topologically compatible non-Hermitian skin effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05315" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05315</a>
<br>
<i>Rijia Lin, Linhu Li</i>
<p>The bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) relates in-gap boundary modes to bulk
topological invariants. In certain non-Hermitian topological systems,
conventional BBC becomes invalid in the presence of the non-Hermitian skin
effect (NHSE), which manifests as distinct energy spectra under the periodic
and open boundary conditions and massive eigenstate localization at boundaries.
In this work, we introduce a scheme to induce NHSE without breaking
conventional BBC, dubbed as the topologically compatible NHSE (TC-NHSE). In a
general one dimensional two-band model, we unveil two types of TC-NHSE that do
not alter topological phase transition points under any circumstance or only in
a certain parameter regime, respectively. Extending our model into two
dimension, we find that TC-NHSE can be selectively compatible to different sets
of Weyl points between different bands of the resultant semimetallic system,
turning some of them into bulk Fermi arcs while keeping the rest unchanged. Our
work hence helps clarify the intricate interplay between topology and NHSE in
non-Hermitian systems, and provides a versatile approach for designing
non-Hermitian topological systems where topological properties and NHSE do not
interfere each other.

<h3>Momentum-dependent quasiparticle properties of the Fermi polaron from  the functional renormalization group</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05318</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas von Milczewski, Richard Schmidt</i>
<p>We study theoretically the lifetimes of attractive and repulsive Fermi
polarons, as well as the molecule at finite momentum in three dimensions. To
this end, we develop a new technique that allows for the computation of Green's
functions in the whole complex frequency plane using exact analytical
continuation within the functional renormalization group. The improved
numerical stability and reduced computational cost of this method yield access
to previously inaccessible momentum-dependent quasiparticle properties of
low-lying excited states. While conventional approaches like the
non-selfconsistent $T$-matrix approximation method cannot determine these
lifetimes, we are able to find the momentum-dependent lifetime at different
interaction strengths of both the attractive and repulsive polaron as well as
the molecule. At weak coupling our results confirm predictions made from
effective Fermi liquid theory regarding the decay of the attractive polaron,
and we demonstrate that Fermi liquid-like behavior extends far into the
strong-coupling regime where attractive polaron and molecule exhibit a $p^4$
momentum scaling in their decay widths. Our results offer an intriguing insight
into the momentum-dependent quasiparticle properties of the Fermi polaron
problem, which can be measured using techniques such as Raman transfer and
Ramsey interferometry.

<h3>Beyond-mean-field effects in mixtures: few-body and many-body aspects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05336" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05336</a>
<br>
<i>D.S. Petrov</i>
<p>The discovery of ultracold dilute liquids has significantly elevated our
interest in various phenomena which go under the name of beyond-mean-field
(BMF) physics. In these lecture notes we give an elementary introduction to the
quantum stabilization and liquefaction of a collapsing weakly interacting
Bose-Bose mixture. A detailed derivation of the leading BMF correction, also
known as the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, in this system is presented in a manner
suitable for further generalizations and extensions. Although the LHY term is a
nonanalytic function of the density $n$, under certain conditions the leading
BMF correction becomes analytic and can be expanded in integer powers of $n$,
effectively introducing three-body and higher-order interactions. We discuss
why and how well the Bogoliubov approach can predict these few-body
observables.

<h3>Active Learning approach to simulations of Strongly Correlated Matter  with the Ghost Gutzwiller Approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05343" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05343</a>
<br>
<i>Marius S. Frank, Denis G. Artiukhi, Tsung-Han Lee, Yongxin Yao, Kipton Barros, Ove Christiansen, Nicola Lanatà</i>
<p>Quantum embedding (QE) methods such as the Ghost Gutzwiller Approximation
(gGA) offer a powerful approach to simulating strongly-correlated systems, but
come with the computational bottleneck of computing the ground state of an
auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) iteratively. In this work, we introduce an
active learning (AL) framework integrated within the gGA to address this
challenge. The methodology is applied to the single-band Hubbard model and
results in a significant reduction in the number of instances where the EH must
be solved. Through a principal component analysis (PCA), we find that the EH
parameters form a low-dimensional structure that is largely independent of the
geometric specifics of the systems, especially in the strongly-correlated
regime. Our AL strategy enables us to discover this low-dimensionality
structure on the fly, while leveraging it for reducing the computational cost
of gGA, laying the groundwork for more efficient simulations of complex
strongly-correlated materials.

<h3>Programmable patchy particles for materials design</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05360" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05360</a>
<br>
<i>Ella M. King, Chrisy Xiyu Du, Qian-Ze Zhu, Samuel S. Schoenholz, Michael P. Brenner</i>
<p>Direct design of complex functional materials would revolutionize
technologies ranging from printable organs to novel clean energy devices.
However, even incremental steps towards designing functional materials have
proven challenging. If the material is constructed from highly complex
components, the design space of materials properties rapidly becomes too
computationally expensive to search. On the other hand, very simple components
such as uniform spherical particles are not powerful enough to capture rich
functional behavior. Here, we introduce a differentiable materials design model
with components that are simple enough to design yet powerful enough to capture
complex materials properties: rigid bodies composed of spherical particles with
directional interactions (patchy particles). We showcase the method with
self-assembly designs ranging from open lattices to self-limiting clusters, all
of which are notoriously challenging design goals to achieve using purely
isotropic particles. By directly optimizing over the location and interaction
of the patches on patchy particles using gradient descent, we dramatically
reduce the computation time for finding the optimal building blocks.

<h3>Kink in cuprates: the role of the low-energy density of states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05378" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05378</a>

<i>E. Razzoli, F. Boschini, M. Zonno, M. X. Na, M. Michiardi, M. Schneider, E. H. da Silva Neto, S. Gorovikov, R. D. Zhong, J. Schneeloch, G. D. Gu, S. Zhdanovich, A. K. Mills, G. Levy, D. J. Jones, C. Giannetti, A. Damascelli</i>
<p>The 40-70 meV band-structure renormalization (so-called kink) in
high-temperature cuprate superconductors - which has been mainly interpreted in
terms of electron-boson coupling - is observed to be strongly suppressed both
above the superconducting transition temperature and under optical excitation.
We employ equilibrium and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,
in combination with Migdal-Eliashberg simulations, to investigate the
suppression of the near-nodal kink in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. We
show that the $\sim$30$\%$ decrease of the kink strength across the
superconducting-to-normal-state phase transition can be entirely accounted for
by the filling of the superconducting gap, without additional consideration of
temperature-dependent electron-boson coupling. Our findings demonstrate that
consideration of changes in the density of states is essential to
quantitatively account for the band structure renormalization effects in
cuprates.

<h3>Active oscillator: recurrence relation approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05406" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05406</a>
<br>
<i>Derek Frydel</i>
<p>The present work analyzes stationary distributions of active Brownian
particles in a harmonic trap. Generally, obtaining stationary distributions for
this system is non-trivial, and up to date no exact expressions are available.
In this work, we develop and explore a method based on a transformation of the
Fokker-Planck equation into a recurrence relation for generating moments of a
distribution. The method, therefore, offers an analytically tractable approach,
an alternative to numerical simulations, in a situation where more direct
analytical approaches fail. Although the current work focuses on the active
Brownian particle model, the method is general and valid for any type of active
dynamics and any system dimension.

<h3>Molecular Autonomous Pathfinder using Deep Reinforcement Learning</h3>

<br>
<i>Ken-ichi Nomura, Ankit Mishra, Tian Sang, Rajiv K. Kalia, Aiichiro Nakano, Priya Vashishta</i>
<p>Diffusion in solids is a slow process that dictates rate-limiting processes
in key chemical reactions. Unlike crystalline solids that offer well-defined
diffusion pathways, the lack of similar structural motifs in amorphous or
glassy materials poses a great scientific challenge in estimating slow
diffusion time. To tackle this problem, we have developed an AI-guided
long-time atomistic simulation approach: Molecular Autonomous Pathfinder (MAP)
framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), where RL agent is trained
to uncover energy efficient diffusion pathways. We employ Deep Q-Network
architecture with distributed prioritized replay buffer enabling fully online
agent training with accelerated experience sampling by an ensemble of
asynchronous agents. After training, the agents provide atomistic
configurations of diffusion pathways with their energy profile. We use a
piecewise Nudged Elastic Band to refine the energy profile of the obtained
pathway and corresponding diffusion time on the basis of transition state
theory. With MAP, we have successfully identified atomistic mechanisms along
molecular diffusion pathways in amorphous silica, with time scales comparable
to experiments.

<h3>Evidence of Gas Phase Nucleation of Nano Diamond in Microwave Plasma  Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05453" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05453</a>
<br>
<i>Tanvi Nikhar, Sergey V. Baryshev</i>
<p>The mechanism of ballas like nano crystalline diamond formation (NCD) still
remains elusive, and this work attempts to analyze its formation in the
framework of activation energy ($E_\text{a}$) of NCD films grown from
H$_\text{2}$/CH$_\text{4}$ plasma in a 2.45 GHz chemical vapor deposition
system. The $E_\text{a}$ is calculated using the Arrhenius equation
corresponding to the thickness growth rate while using substrate temperature
($\sim1000-1300$ K) in all the calculations. While the calculated values match
with the $E_\text{a}$ for nano diamond formation throughout the literature,
these values of $\sim$10 kcal/mol are lower compared to $\sim$15 -- 25 kcal/mol
for standard single crystal diamond (SCD) formation, concluding thus far, that
the energetics and processes involved are different. In this work, To further
investigate this, the substrate preparation and sample collection method are
modified while keeping the growth parameters constant. Unseeded Si substrates
are physically separated from the plasma discharge by a molybdenum plate with a
pinhole drilled in it. Small quantities of a sample substance are collected on
the substrates. The sample is characterized by electron microscopy and Raman
spectroscopy confirming it to be nano diamond, thus, suggesting that nano
diamond self nucleates in the plasma and flows to the substrate which acts as a
mere collection plate. It is hypothesized then, if nano diamond nucleates in
gas phase, gas temperature has to be used in the Arrhenius analysis. The
$E_\text{a}$ values for all the nano diamond films are re-calculated using the
simulated gas temperature ($\sim1500-2000$ K) obtained from a simple
H$_\text{2}$/CH$_\text{4}$ plasma model, giving values within the range
characteristic to SCD formation. A unified growth mechanism for NCD and SCD is
proposed concluding that the limiting reactions for NCD and SCD formation are
the same.

<h3>Spectroscopy-Guided Discovery of Three-Dimensional Structures of  Disordered Materials with Diffusion Models</h3>

<br>
<i>Hyuna Kwon, Tim Hsu, Wenyu Sun, Wonseok Jeong, Fikret Aydin, James Chapman, Xiao Chen, Matthew R. Carbone, Deyu Lu, Fei Zhou, Tuan Anh Pham</i>
<p>The ability to rapidly develop materials with desired properties has a
transformative impact on a broad range of emerging technologies. In this work,
we introduce a new framework based on the diffusion model, a recent generative
machine learning method to predict 3D structures of disordered materials from a
target property. For demonstration, we apply the model to identify the atomic
structures of amorphous carbons ($a$-C) as a representative material system
from the target X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra--a common
experimental technique to probe atomic structures of materials. We show that
conditional generation guided by XANES spectra reproduces key features of the
target structures. Furthermore, we show that our model can steer the generative
process to tailor atomic arrangements for a specific XANES spectrum. Finally,
our generative model exhibits a remarkable scale-agnostic property, thereby
enabling generation of realistic, large-scale structures through learning from
a small-scale dataset (i.e., with small unit cells). Our work represents a
significant stride in bridging the gap between materials characterization and
atomic structure determination; in addition, it can be leveraged for materials
discovery in exploring various material properties as targeted.

<h3>A standard form of master equations for general non-Markovian jump  processes: the Laplace-space embedding framework and asymptotic solution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05475</a>
<br>
<i>Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Didier Sornette</i>
<p>We present a standard form of master equations (ME) for general
one-dimensional non-Markovian (history-dependent) jump processes, complemented
by an asymptotic solution derived from an expanded system-size approach. The ME
is obtained by developing a general Markovian embedding using a suitable set of
auxiliary field variables. This Markovian embedding uses a Laplace-convolution
operation applied to the velocity trajectory. We introduce an asymptotic method
tailored for this ME standard, generalising the system-size expansion for these
jump processes. Under specific stability conditions tied to a single noise
source, upon coarse-graining, the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) emerges
as a universal approximate model for point processes in the weak-coupling
limit. This methodology offers a unified analytical toolset for general
non-Markovian processes, reinforcing the universal applicability of the GLE
founded in microdynamics and the principles of statistical physics.

<h3>Chiral symmetry breaking and topological charge of graphene nanoribbons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05487" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05487</a>
<br>
<i>Hyun Cheol Lee, S.-R. Eric Yang</i>
<p>We explore the edge properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons featuring
two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent
Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene
nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected
topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and
time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism,
the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An
analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological
charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the
ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears
as a nearly zero-energy edge mode.

<h3>Van der Waals semiconductor InSe plastifies by phase transformation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05495" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05495</a>
<br>
<i>Yandong Sun, Yupeng Ma, Jin-yu Zhang, Tian-Ran Wei, Xun Shi, David Rodney, Ben Xu</i>
<p>Inorganic semiconductor materials are integral to various modern
technologies, yet their brittleness and limited deformability/processability
pose a significant challenge in the development of flexible, wearable, and
miniaturized electronics. The recent discovery of room-temperature plasticity
in a few inorganic semiconductors offers a promising pathway to address this
challenge, but the deformation mechanisms of these materials remain unclear.
Here, we investigate the deformation of InSe, a two-dimensional (2D) van der
Waals (vdW) semiconductor with substantial plasticity. By developing a
machine-learned deep potential, we perform atomistic simulations that capture
the deformation features of hexagonal InSe upon out-of-plane compression.
Surprisingly, we discover that InSe plastifies through a so-far unrecognized
martensitic phase transformation; that is, the layered hexagonal structure is
converted to a tetragonal lattice with specific orientation relationship. This
observation is corroborated by high-resolution experimental observations and
theory. It suggests a change of paradigm, where the design of new
plastically-deformable inorganic semiconductors should focus on compositions
and structures that favor phase transformations rather than traditional
dislocation slip.

<i>Ryan T. Grimm, Joel D. Eaves</i>
<p>Inspired by path-integral solutions to the quantum relaxation problem, we
develop a numerical method to solve classical stochastic differential equations
with multiplicative noise that avoids averaging over trajectories. To test the
method, we simulate the dynamics of a classical oscillator multiplicatively
coupled to non-Markovian noise. When accelerated using tensor factorization
techniques, it accurately estimates the transition into the bifurcation regime
of the oscillator and outperforms trajectory-averaging simulations with a
computational cost that is orders of magnitude lower.

<h3>Computational workflow for investigating hydrogen permeation in novel  hydrogen storage materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Sourabh Singha, Abhijit Chatterjee</i>
<p>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has set ambitious targets for
hydrogen storage materials for onboard light-duty cars which are to be achieved
by 2027. One of the major problems in solid hydrogen storage materials is the
sluggish uptake/release kinetics. Much attention has been focused on
understanding kinetics. Hydrogen solid-state diffusion is a rate-controlling
step in the majority of metal hydrides. Here we dis-cuss computational workflow
which can be used to estimate hydrogen diffusivity. A de-tailed study of
hydrogen concentration, hydrogen neighbors is performed on nickel hy-dride
(NiH) fcc materials to understand their effect on H diffusion. The nudged
elastic band (NEB) method is used to determine hydrogen diffusion barrier with
various hydro-gen concentrations in presence of hydrogen neighbors. The energy
barriers for hydrogen hopping were calculated for few million different
configurations with various local chemical environments. Two paths for H
hopping from one octahedral site to a vacant neighbor octahedral site are
identified: one path is straight, and the other is curved via tetrahedral site.
The curved path shows diffusion faster than the straight path. This study
demonstrates H diffusion is faster at higher hydrogen concentration, as the
concomitant volume expansion lowers the energy barrier.

<h3>Broken weak and strong spin rotational symmetries and tunable  interaction between phonon and the continuum in Cr2Ge2Te6</h3>

<i>Atul G. Chakkar, Deepu Kumar, Pradeep Kumar</i>
<p>Phase transitions with lowering temperature is a manifestation of decreased
entropy and within the Landau theoretical framework these are accompanied by
the symmetry breaking. Whenever a symmetry is broken weakly or strongly, it
leaves its trail and the same may be captured indirectly using renormalization
of the quasi-particle excitations. Cr2Ge2Te6, a quasi-two-dimensional magnetic
material, provides a rich playground to probe dynamics of the quasi-particle
excitations as well as multiple phase transitions with lowering temperature
intimately linked with the lattice and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report
in-depth inelastic light scattering measurements on single crystals of
Cr2Ge2Te6 as a function of temperature, from 6 K to 330 K, and polarization.
Our measurements reveal the long as well as short range ordering of the spins
below Tc (~ 60 K) and T* (~ 180 K), respectively; setting the stage for broken
rotational and time reversal symmetry, gauged via the distinct renormalization
of the phonon self-energy parameters along with the modes intensity. Our
measurements also uncovered an intriguing dependence of the interaction
strength between discrete state (phonon here) and the underlying continuum,
quantified using the Fano asymmetry parameter, as a function of the scattered
light polarization. Our results suggest the possibility of tuning the
interaction strength using controlled scattered light and symmetry in this 2D
magnet.

<h3>Chemical potential of magnetic skyrmion quasiparticles in heavy  metal/iron bilayers</h3>

<i>Balázs Nagyfalusi, László Udvardi, László Szunyogh, Levente Rózsa</i>
<p>We performed metadynamics Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the free energy
as a function of the topological charge in the skyrmion-hosting magnetic model
systems (Pt$_{0.95}$Ir$_{0.05}$)/Fe/Pd(111) and Pd/Fe/Ir(111), using a spin
model containing parameters based on ab initio calculations. Using the
topological charge as collective variable, this method allows for evaluating
the temperature dependence of the number of skyrmionic quasiparticles. In
addition, from the free-energy cost of increasing and decreasing the
topological charge of the system we determined chemical potentials as a
function of the temperature. At lower temperature, the chemical potential for
creating skyrmions and antiskyrmions from the topologically trivial state is
different. This splitting of the chemical potential is particularly pronounced
for large external magnetic fields when the system is in a field-polarized
phase. We observed a change in the shape of the free-energy curves when
skyrmion-skyrmion interactions become more pronounced.

as a function of the frustration parameter (a ratio of F and AF interactions)
and the interaction between triangles consists of the ferromagnetic, two
ferrimagnetic and the singlet phases. We study the magnetic properties in these
phases and analyze the magnetization curves. We show that there are the
magnetization plateau in the singlet phase and the magnetization jumps in some
region of this phase. We study the low-thermodynamics and its relation to the
specific structure of the excitation spectrum of the triangle chain.

<p>A vesicle is a spherical structure composed of a phospholipid bilayer that is
used as a container for chemicals, both it in vivo and it in vitro systems. In
both cases, the vesicles can be passively moved using external molecular motors
or flows. The active motion of the vesicles can potentially expand their
applications in microfluid devices. In this study, we created giant unilamellar
vesicles (GUVs) that loads dodecanethiol-functionalized gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) using natural swelling method. An external alternating current (AC)
electric field was applied to the sample to drive the system. A flow was
confirmed with dense optical flow method around GUVs, even in the absence of
AuNPs. The quadratic dependence of the flow on applied elecric fields confirms
that the flow is due to induced charge electro-osmotic (ICEO) mechanism.
Furthermore, the GUVs containing AuNPs moved and deformed significantly under
external AC electric fields compared with those without AuNPs. We also
confirmed that the translational speed of GUVs was positively correlated with
the volume ratio of AuNPs. These experimental results suggest that the motion
and deformation of GUVs were cause by ICEO flow, which was unbalanced owing to
the presence of localized AuNPs on the membrane.

<p>The aggregation or clustering of proteins and other macromolecules plays an
important role in the formation of large-scale molecular assemblies within cell
membranes. Examples include lipid rafts and postsynaptic domains (PSDs). PSDs
are rich in scaffolding proteins that transiently trap transmembrane
neurotransmitter receptors, thus localizing them at specific spatial positions.
Hence, PSDs play a key role in determining the strength of synaptic connections
and their regulation during learning and memory. Recently, a 2D
diffusion-mediated aggregation model of PSD formation has been developed in
which the spatial locations of the clusters are determined by a set of fixed
anchoring sites. The system is kept out of equilibrium by the recycling of
particles between the cell membrane and interior. This results in a stationary
distribution consisting of multiple clusters, whose average size can be
determined using an effective mean-field description of the particle
concentration around each anchored cluster. In this paper, we derive
corrections to mean-field theory using asymptotic methods, assuming that the
clusters are well separated and much smaller than the membrane surface. The
analysis proceeds by matching inner solutions around each cluster with and an
outer region where mean-field interactions occur. This generates an asymptotic
expansion of the particle concentration that sums over all logarithmic terms
involving the small parameter $\nu=-1/\ln \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ specifies
the relative size of the clusters. This is then used to derive an expression
for the radius of each cluster, which includes higher-order corrections to
mean-field theory that depend on the positions of the clusters and the boundary
of the domain. Finally, motivated by a recent study of light-activated protein
oligomerization in cells, we develop the analogous theory for cluster formation
in a 2D domain.

<h3>Topological Interfaces of Luttinger Liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05566" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05566</a>
<br>
<i>Ananda Roy, Hubert Saleur</i>
<p>Topological interfaces of two-dimensional conformal field theories contain
information about symmetries of the theory and exhibit striking spectral and
entanglement characteristics. While lattice realizations of these interfaces
have been proposed for unitary minimal models, the same has remained elusive
for the paradigmatic Luttinger liquid {\it i.e.,} the free, compact boson
model. Here, we show that a topological interface of two Luttinger liquids can
be realized by coupling special one-dimensional superconductors. The gapless
excitations in the latter carry charges that are specific integer multiples of
the charge of Cooper-pairs. The aforementioned integers are determined by the
windings in the target space of the bosonic fields -- a crucial element
required to give rise to nontrivial topological interfaces. The latter occur
due to the perfect transmission of certain number of Cooper-pairs across the
interface. The topological interfaces arise naturally in Josephson junction
arrays with the simplest case being realized by an array of
experimentally-demonstrated~$0-\pi$ qubits, capacitors and ordinary Josephson
junctions. Signatures of the topological interface are obtained through
entanglement entropy computations. In particular, the subleading contribution
to the so-called interface entropy is shown to differ from existing field
theory predictions. The proposed lattice model provides an
experimentally-realizable alternative to spin and anyon chains for the analysis
of several conjectured conformal fixed points which have so far eluded
ab-initio investigation.

<p>The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at oxide interfaces exhibits various
exotic properties stemming from interfacial inversion symmetry breaking. In
this work, we report the emergence of large nonlinear Hall effects (NHE) in the
LaAlO3/KTaO3(111) interface 2DEG under zero magnetic field. Skew scattering was
identified as the dominant origin based on the cubic scaling of nonlinear Hall
conductivity with longitudinal conductivity and the threefold symmetry.
Moreover, a gate-tunable NHE with pronounced peak and dip was observed and
reproduced by our theoretical calculation. These results indicate the presence
of Berry curvature hotspots and thus a large Berry curvature triple at the
oxide interface. Our theoretical calculations confirm the existence of large
Berry curvatures from the avoided crossing of multiple 5d-orbit bands, orders
of magnitude larger than that in transition-metal dichalcogenides. NHE offers a
new pathway to probe the Berry curvature at oxide interfaces, and facilitates
new applications in oxide nonlinear electronics.

<p>Compressed sensing is an image reconstruction technique to achieve
high-quality results from limited amount of data. In order to achieve this, it
utilizes prior knowledge about the samples that shall be reconstructed.
Focusing on image reconstruction in nanotomography, this work proposes
enhancements by including additional problem-specific knowledge. In more
detail, we propose further classes of algebraic inequalities that are added to
the compressed sensing model. The first consists in a valid upper bound on the
pixel brightness. It only exploits general information about the projections
and is thus applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems. The second
class is applicable whenever the sample material is of roughly homogeneous
composition. The model favors a constant density and penalizes deviations from
it. The resulting mathematical optimization models are algorithmically
tractable and can be solved to global optimality by state-of-the-art available
implementations of interior point methods. In order to evaluate the novel
models, obtained results are compared to existing image reconstruction methods,
tested on simulated and experimental data sets. The experimental data comprise
one 360{\deg} electron tomography tilt series of a macroporous zeolite particle
and one absorption contrast nano X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) data set
of a copper microlattice structure. The enriched models are optimized quickly
and show improved reconstruction quality, outperforming the existing models.
Promisingly, our approach yields superior reconstruction results, particularly
when information about the samples is available for a small number of tilt
angles only

<p>Graphene/hBN/graphene tunnel devices offer promise as sensitive mid-infrared
photodetectors but the microscopic origin underlying the photoresponse in them
remains elusive. In this work, we investigated the photocurrent generation in
graphene/hBN/graphene tunnel structures with localized defect states under
mid-IR illumination. We demonstrate that the photocurrent in these devices is
proportional to the second derivative of the tunnel current with respect to the
bias voltage, peaking during tunneling through the hBN impurity level. We
revealed that the origin of the photocurrent generation lies in the change of
the tunneling probability upon radiation-induced electron heating in graphene
layers, in agreement with the theoretical model that we developed. Finally, we
show that at a finite bias voltage, the photocurrent is proportional to the
either of the graphene layers heating under the illumination, while at zero
bias, it is proportional to the heating difference. Thus, the photocurrent in
such devices can be used for accurate measurements of the electronic
temperature providing a convenient alternative to Johnson noise thermometry.

<p>TaCo$_2$Te$_2$ is recently reported to be an air-stable, high mobility Van
der Waals material with probable magnetic order. Here we investigate the
scaling behavior of its magnetoresistance. We measured both the longitudinal
($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall ($\rho_{xy}$) magnetoresistivities of TaCo$_2$Te$_2$
crystals in magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis and found that the
magnetoresistance violates the Kohler's rule $MR \sim f[H/\rho_0]$ while
obeying the extended Kohler's rule $MR \sim f[H/(n_T\rho_0)]$, where $MR \sim
[\rho_{xx}(H)-\rho_0]/\rho_0$, $H$ is the magnetic field, $n_T$ is a thermal
factor, $\rho_{xx}(H)$ and $\rho_0$ are the resistivities at $H$ and zero
field, respectively. While deviating from those of the densities of electrons
($n_e$) and holes ($n_h$) obtained from the two-band model analysis of the
magnetoconductivities, the temperature dependence of $n_T$ is close to that of
the Hall carrier densities $n_H$ calculated from the slopes of $\rho_{xy}(H)$
curves at low magnetic fields, providing a new way to obtain the thermal factor
in the extended Kohler's rule.

<p>We present a theoretical investigation on the pressure-induced emergence of
Dirac semimetallic properties in the XCdP (X = Na, K) materials, employing
first-principles calculations. Dirac semimetals, characterized by linear
dispersion relations in their electronic band structures, have gained
prominence due to their unique topological features and potential applications
in electronic devices. Through systematic calculations, we explore the
electronic structure evolution of NaCdP and KCdP under varying pressure
conditions. Our findings reveal a compelling transition to a Dirac semimetallic
state in both NaCdP and KCdP under applied pressure. The electronic band
structures exhibit distinct Dirac cones at the Fermi level, indicating the
presence of massless Dirac fermions. Moreover, the pressure-induced Dirac
semi-metallic phase in these compounds are found to be robust, and are
protected by crystal symmetry. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the
bandgap, Fermi surface, and other relevant electronic properties, offering
insights into the pressure-driven phase transition in NaCdP and KCdP. The
tunability of these materials under external pressure suggests their potential
utility in next-generation electronic devices and quantum technologies.

<h3>Can silica nanoparticles improve lithium transport in polymer  electrolytes?</h3>

<br>
<i>Joel Martin Dalmas, Ambroise van Roekeghem, Natalio Mingo, Stefano Mossa</i>
<p>The question of if silica nanoparticles can enhance the ionic conductivity of
a polymer electrolyte above its crystallization temperature has remained
unclear for the two decades following the first experiments on these systems.
We use Molecular Dynamics simulations to decipher the atomic scale mechanisms
affecting the properties of LiTFSI-poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes upon the
addition of silica nanoparticles. At any ionic concentration, adding
nanoparticles significantly decreases the conductivity. Most of this reduction
can be simply accounted for by the diffusion equation, resulting from the fact
that the space occupied by the nanoparticles is made inactive and unable to
sustain ionic diffusion. We identify two distinct regimes, above and below a
concentration threshold, corresponding to very different ionic distributions
and coordination features of the various species. The lack of conductivity
enhancement observed in the simulations supports the conclusions of some recent
measurements, and disagrees with the earliest experimental reports on hybrid
silica/polyethylene-oxide electrolytes.

<i>Xinyuan Song, Liang Yang, Chuang Deng</i>
<p>Grain boundary (GB) migration stands as a linchpin process governing
microstructural evolution in polycrystalline materials. Over the past decade,
the concept of shear coupling, quantified through the shear coupling factor,
has transformed our understanding and driven the development of theoretical
frameworks for unifying GB behaviors. In this study, we unveil a critical
shortcoming in the definition of shear coupling factor and introduce a
mathematically redefined descriptor - shear coupling strength - along with its
corresponding tensor. This innovation accurately characterizes intrinsic shear
coupling properties across diverse GBs and reveals complex dynamics within the
GB mobility tensor, with a mathematical proof affirming its symmetry that is
assumed in previous studies. Additionally, an efficient methodology has been
developed for streamlined extraction of both shear coupling and GB mobility
tensors from atomistic simulations. This advancement holds the potential to
sample GB behavior across extensive datasets, significantly enhancing our
ability to predict structure-property relationships within the expansive
5-parameter space of GBs.

<p>Semiconductors are currently an active topic of study due to the endless
range of applications in electronic hardware and computer engineering. In this
experiment, the material properties (i.e. resistivity $\rho$, Hall coefficient
$R_{H}$, and mobility $\mu$) of a doped GaAs sheet is described by utilizing
Hall Effect and the Van der Pauw method with varying temperature $T$ and
magnetic field values $B$. It is determined that the sample is an $n$-type
semiconductor using the sign of $R_H$, which is measured to be $R_H = -2.9
\times 10^{-12} \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-14} ~ \text{m}^{3} \text{C}^{-1}$, at $T =
303 ~\text{K}$ and $B = 3.3 ~\text{kGs}$. Furthermore, the rate of change for
the slope $R_H$ and $T$ is increasing along $B$ at the rate of $\Delta k/
\Delta B = \left(3.6 \pm 0.5 \right) \times 10^{-16} ~\text{m}^3 (\text{CK}
\cdot \text{kGs})^{-1}$, meaning the charge accumulation caused by the current
and Lorentz force is quadratic in $B$. It is also discovered that $\mu$, and
therefore the electron drift velocity is reduced proportionally at higher
$T$-values. This method provides a potential analogue in quantum scales with
the Quantum Hall Effect and characterisation of quantum dots.

<h3>Understanding muon diffusion in perovskite oxides below room temperature  based on harmonic transition state theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05755</a>
<br>
<i>T. U. Ito, W. Higemoto, K. Shimomura</i>
<p>In positive muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) spectroscopy,
positive muons ($\mu^+$) implanted into solid oxides are conventionally treated
as immobile spin-probes at interstitial sites below room temperature. This is
because each $\mu^+$ is thought to be tightly bound to an oxygen atom in the
host lattice to form a muonic analogue of the hydroxy group. On the basis of
this concept, anomalies in $\mu^+$SR spectra observed in oxides have been
attributed in most cases to the intrinsic properties of host materials. On the
other hand, global $\mu^+$ diffusion with an activation energy of $\sim$0.1~eV
has been reported in some chemically-substituted perovskite oxides at cryogenic
temperatures, although the reason for the small activation energy despite the
formation of the strong O$\mu$ bond has not yet been quantitatively understood.
In this study, we investigated interstitial $\mu^+$ diffusion in the perovskite
oxide lattice using KTaO$_3$ cubic perovskite as a model system. We used the
$\mu^+$SR method and density functional theory calculations along with the
harmonic transition state theory to study this phenomenon both experimentally
and theoretically. Experimental activation energies for global $\mu^+$
diffusion obtained below room temperature were less than a quarter of the
calculated classical potential barrier height for a bottleneck $\mu^+$ transfer
path. The reduction in the effective barrier height could be explained by the
harmonic transition state theory with a zero-point energy correction; a
significant difference in zero-point energies for $\mu^+$ at the positions in
the O$\mu$ bonding equilibrium state and a bond-breaking transition state was
the primary cause of the reduction. This suggests that the assumption of
immobile $\mu^+$ in solid oxides is not always satisfied since such a
significant decrease in diffusion barrier height can also occur in other
oxides.

<p>Ambient magnetic skyrmions stabilized in multilayer nanostructures are of
immense interest due to their relevance to magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)
devices for memory and unconventional computing applications. However, existing
skyrmionic nanostructures built using conventional metallic or oxide multilayer
nanodots are unable to concurrently fulfill the requirements of nanoscale
skyrmion stability and feasibility of all-electrical readout and manipulation.
Here, we develop a few-repeat hybrid multilayer platform consisting of metallic
[Pt/CoB/Ir]3 and oxide [Pt/CoB/MgO] components that are coupled to evolve
together as a single, composite stack. Zero-field (ZF) skyrmions with sizes as
small as 50 nm are stabilized in the hybrid multilayer nanodots, which are
smoothly modulated by up to 2.5x by varying CoB thickness and dot sizes.
Meanwhile, skyrmion multiplets are also stabilized by small bias fields.
Crucially, we observe higher order 'target' skyrmions with varying
magnetization rotations in moderately-sized, low anisotropy nanodots. These
results provide a viable route to realize long-sought skyrmionic MTJ devices
and new possibilities for multi-state skyrmionic device concepts.

<p>Machine learning, with its remarkable ability for retrieving information and
identifying patterns from data, has emerged as a powerful tool for discovering
governing equations. It has been increasingly informed by physics, and more
recently by thermodynamics, to further uncover the thermodynamic structure
underlying the evolution equations, i.e., the thermodynamic potentials driving
the system and the operators governing the kinetics. However, despite its great
success, the inverse problem of thermodynamic model discovery from macroscopic
data is in many cases non-unique, meaning that multiple pairs of potentials and
operators can give rise to the same macroscopic dynamics, which significantly
hinders the physical interpretability of the learned models. In this work, we
propose a machine learning framework, named as Statistical-Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (Stat-PINNs), which further encodes knowledge from statistical
mechanics and resolves this non-uniqueness issue for the first time. The
framework is here developed for purely dissipative isothermal systems. It only
uses data from short-time particle simulations to learn the thermodynamic
structure, which can be used to predict long-time macroscopic evolutions. We
demonstrate the approach for particle systems with Arrhenius-type interactions,
common to a wide range of phenomena, such as defect diffusion in solids,
surface absorption and chemical reactions. Stat-PINNs can successfully recover
the known analytic solution for the case with long-range interaction and
discover the hitherto unknown potential and operator governing the short-range
interaction cases. We compare our results with an analogous approach that
solely excludes statistical mechanics, and observe that, in addition to
recovering the unique thermodynamic structure, statistical mechanics relations
can increase the robustness and predictability of the learning strategy.

by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surfaces, within

cases when Dirac-like 1D modes appear in the nanotube spectrum and their
hybridization with localized impurity states produces, at growing impurity
concentration $c$, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and even
opening, at yet higher $c$, of some narrow delocalized range within this
mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with the similar effects in the

<p>Superplastic behavior of ultrafine-grained (UFG) Al-6Mg-0.12Sc-0.10Zr-0.1X
alloys, where X = Yb (Alloy #1-Yb), Er (Alloy #2-Er), and Hf (Alloy #3-Hf), has
been studied. The total content of Sc, Zr, Yb, Er, Hf in the alloys was 0.32
wt.% (0.117-0.118 at.%). The alloys used for benchmarking were
Al-6Mg-0.12Sc-0.20Zr (Alloy #4-Zr) and Al-6Mg-0.22Sc-0.10Zr (Alloy #5-Sc).
Their UFG microstructure was formed with ECAP. Two different types of
deformation behavior during superplasticity were demonstrated. A simultaneous
increase in yield stress and elongation to failure during superplastic
deformation was discovered. High deformation temperatures were shown to cause a
competition between dynamic (strain-induced) grain growth and dynamic
recrystallization, leading to a finer grain microstructure. The values of
strain hardening factor (n), strain rate sensitivity factor (m), and
superplastic deformation threshold stress (Sp) were determined. The impact of
the type and concentration of alloying elements on the deformation behavior and
dynamic grain growth of Al-6%Mg alloys was investigated. It was established
that the maximum elongation to failure in Alloy #1-Yb and Alloy #2-Er is
observed at lower deformation temperatures than in Alloy #4-Zr and Alloy #5-Sc.
The superplastic properties of Alloy #3-Hf are superior to those of Alloy #4-Zr
and Alloy #5-Sc with high content of alloying elements (in at.%). Alloy #1-Yb
manifests good elongation to failure (910%) at low temperatures (400 oC). The
satisfiability of Hart's criterion for calculating uniform deformation value
under superplastic conditions was verified. It was demonstrated that cavitation
when pores are formed in large Al3X particles at high temperatures causes early
failure of aluminum alloys.

resistance of ceramics was studied under irradiation with swift Xe-ions (E =

from layer to layer. The strained YAG phase formed as a result of Xe ions
irradiation is localized in a near-surface layer with a thickness of ~5 {\mu}m.
Full amorphization of the samples was observed under irradiation with a fluence
of 1x10^13 cm-2. The calculated critical fluence was 6.5x10^12 cm-2, which
corresponded to 0.03 dpa. The microhardness of the surface layers of irradiated
ceramics is less than the central layers, and, in general, decreases with
increasing ion fluence.

<p>The topology between Bloch states in reciprocal space has attracted
tremendous attention in recent years. The quantum geometry of the band
structure is composed of quantum metric as real part and berry curvature as
imaginary part. While the Berry curvature, the Berry curvature dipole and Berry
connection polarizability have been recently revealed by the first order
anomalous hall, second order and third order nonlinear Hall effect
respectively, the quantum metric induced second order nonlinear transverse and
longitudinal response in topological antiferromagnetic material MnBi2Te4 was
only very recently reported. Here we demonstrate the similar third order
nonlinear transport properties in the topological antiferromagnetic CoNb3S6. We
observed that the third order nonlinear longitudinal V3{\omega} xx increase
significantly at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature TN ~ 29 K, which
was probably induced by the quantum metric without time-reversal symmetry or
inversion symmetry. Besides, temperature-dependent nonlinear behaviour was
observed in the first order I-V curve below the Neel temperature TN, which was
not reported in MnBi2Te4 and FeSn. Such nonlinear I-V behaviour hints for the
possible existence of Charge Density Wave (CDW) state, which has been
discovered in its sister material FeNb3S6. Simultaneously, two plateaus in the
third order nonlinear longitudinal V3{\omega} xx~ I^{\omega} curve are
observed, which is also speculated to be related with the possible CDW state.
However, the genuine mechanism for the first order nonlinear I-V and its
relation with the third order nonlinear transport call for more experimental
investigations and theoretical interpretation. Our work provides a way to
explore third harmonic nonlinear transport and interaction with magnetic order

<p>Attaining viable thermoelectric cooling at cryogenic temperatures is of major
fundamental and technological interest for novel electronics and quantum
materials applications. In-device temperature control can provide a more
efficient and precise thermal environment management as compared to the
conventional global cooling. Here we develop nanoscale cryogenic imaging of a
magneto-thermoelectric effect and demonstrate absolute cooling and an ultrahigh
Ettingshausen effect in exfoliated WTe2 Weyl semimetal flakes at liquid He
temperatures. Application of a current and perpendicular magnetic field gives
rise to cooling via generation of electron-hole pairs on one side of the sample
and heating by their recombination at the opposite side. In contrast to bulk
materials, the cooling process is found to be nonmonotonic in magnetic field
and device size. The derived model of magneto-thermoelectricity in mesoscopic
semimetal devices shows that the cooling efficiency and the induced temperature
profiles are governed by the interplay between sample geometry, electron-hole
recombination length, magnetic field, and flake and substrate heat
conductivities. The findings open the way for direct integration of microscopic
thermoelectric cooling and for temperature landscape engineering in novel van
der Waals devices.

<h3>Hund's coupling driven interorbital entanglement in orbital-selective  Mott phase</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuekun Niu, Yu Ni, Haishan Zhang, Liang Qiu, Jianli Wang, Leiming Chen, Yun Song, Shiping Feng</i>
<p>We examine the orbital-selective Mott transition in the non-hybridized
two-band Hubbard model using the dynamical mean-field theory. We find that the
orbital-selective Mott transition could be depicted by the local quantum state
fidelity. Additionally, within the orbital-selective Mott phase, the combined
characteristics of the two orbitals lead to the presence of interorbital
entanglement, which is characterized by the non-semi-integer values of local
quantum state fidelity. It is demonstrated that this entanglement is driven by
transverse Hund's coupling, and the mechanisms underlying the orbital-selective
Mott transition show prominent variations depending on the presence or absence
of Hund's coupling and its transverse terms.

<h3>Pressure-Induced Negative-Positive Magnetoresistance Crossover Near  Metal-Insulator Transition in La_{0.8}Ag_{0.1}MnO_{3}</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05862" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05862</a>
<br>
<i>A.G. Gamzatov, T.R. Arslanov, A.R. Kaul, Z.Z. Alisultanov</i>
<p>We investigated the effect of high pressure on the field dependences of
magnetoresistance (MR) in La_{0.8}Ag_{0.1}MnO_{3} near the metal-insulator
transition temperature. Our results showed that an increase in pressure results
in a decrease in the magnitude of negative MR. At pressures $P\geqslant5.6$ GPa
and magnetic fields up to 4 kOe, we observed a positive MR. However, with a
further increase in magnetic field (>4 kOe), the MR again became negative.
Therefore, we discovered a "negative-positive" MR crossover induced by high
pressure near the transition temperature. We supported our experimental
findings with a qualitative theoretical interpretation using the electron-hole
model of MR. This theory explains observed the MR sign change.

<br>
<i>David M T Kuo</i>
<p>The thermoelectric properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) with
array characteristics are investigated theoretically using the tight-binding
model and Green's function technique. The AGNR structures with array
characteristics are created by embedding a narrow boron nitride nanoribbon
(BNNR) into a wider AGNR, resulting in two narrow AGNRs. This system is denoted
as w-AGNR/n-BNNR, where 'w' and 'n' represent the widths of the wider AGNR and
narrow BNNR, respectively. We elucidate the coupling effect between two narrow
symmetrical AGNRs on the electronic structure of w-AGNR/n-BNNR. A notable
discovery is that the power factor of the 15-AGNR/5-BNNR with the minimum width
surpasses the quantum limitation of power factor for 1D ideal systems. The
energy level degeneracy observed in the first subbands of w-AGNR/n-BNNR
structures proves to be highly advantageous in enhancing the electrical power
outputs of graphene nanoribbon devices.

<h3>Superconductivity and Competing Orders in the Square-Lattice $t$-$J$-$V$  Model: Insights into Electron-Doped Cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05893" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05893</a>
<br>
<i>Qianqian Chen, Lei Qiao, Fuchun Zhang, Zheng Zhu</i>
<p>To understand the discrepancies between the experimental observations of the
weak or absent superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates and the
extraordinarily robust superconductivity in numerical results of the
$t$-$J$-type model, we investigate the role of inter-site electron interactions
by studying the $t$-$J$-$V$-type model on square lattices. Based on large-scale
density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify successive phases
when varying the inter-site electron interactions from attraction to repulsion,
including phase separation, uniform $d$-wave superconductivity, and a
pseudogap-like phase featuring pronounced charge-density-wave,
spin-density-wave and superconductivity fluctuations. Within the uniform
superconducting phase in such a process, a gradual suppression of
quasi-long-range superconductivity order occurs, culminating in its ultimate
destruction under elevated inter-site repulsion. We further examine this trend
based on the slave boson mean-field analysis of the role of inter-site electron
interactions. Meanwhile, the decay of charge density correlations slows
slightly, hinting at a nuanced competition between charge density wave and
superconductivity. The subsequent emergence of the pseudogap-like phase
showcases the slight dominance of charge-density-wave fluctuations. Our study
contributes insights that are pertinent to electron-doped cuprates and sheds
light on possibilities to reconcile the theoretical and experimental findings.

<h3>Universal patterns of skyrmion magnetizations unveiled by defect  implantation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05903</a>
<br>
<i>Imara Lima Fernandes, Samir Lounis</i>
<p>Skyrmions are spin-swirling textures hosting wonderful properties with
potential implications in information technology. Such magnetic particles carry
a magnetization, whose amplitude is crucial to establish them as robust
magnetic bits, while their topological nature gives rise to a plethora of
exquisite features such as topological protection, the skyrmion and topological
Hall effects as well as the topological orbital moment. These effects are all
induced by an emergent magnetic field directly proportional to the three-spin
scalar chirality, $\chi= (\mathbf{S}_i\times\mathbf{S}_j)\cdot \mathbf{S}_k$,
and shaped by the peculiar spatial dependence of the magnetization. Here, we
demonstrate the existence of novel chiral magnetizations emerging from the
interplay of spin-orbit interaction and either $\chi$ or the two-spin vector
chirality $\boldsymbol{\kappa} = \mathbf{S}_i\times\mathbf{S}_j$. By
scrutinizing correlations among the spin, orbital (trivial and chiral)
magnetizations, we unveil from ab-initio universal patterns, quantify the rich
set of magnetizations carried by single skyrmions generated in PdFe bilayer on
Ir(111) surface and demonstrate the ability to engineer their magnitude via
controlled implantation of impurities. We anticipate that our findings can
guide the design of disruptive storage devices based on skyrmionic bits by
encoding the desired magnetization with strategic seeding of defects.

<h3>Van Hove singularity-induced negative magnetoresistance in Dirac  semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Kai-He Ding, Zhen-Gang Zhu</i>
<p>Negative magnetoresistance (NMR) is a marked feature of Dirac semimetals, and
may be caused by multiple mechanisms, such as the chiral anomaly, the Zeeman
energy, the quantum interference effect, and the orbital moment. Recently, an
experiment on Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films revealed a new NMR
feature that depends strongly on the thickness of the sample [T. Schumann,
\emph{et al}., Phys. Rev. B 95, 241113(R) (2017)]. Here, we introduce a new
mechanism of inducing NMR via the presence of the van Hove singularity (VHS) in
the density of states. Theoretical fitting of the experimental data on
magnetoconductivity and magnetoresistance shows good agreement, indicating that
the observed NMR in thin films of Cd$_3$As$_2$ can be attributed to the VHS.
This work provides new insights into the underlying of Dirac semimetals.

<h3>Large quantum nonreciprocity in plasmons dragged by drifting electrons</h3>

<br>
<i>Debasis Dutta, Amit Agarwal</i>
<p>Collective plasmon modes, riding on top of drifting electrons, acquire a
fascinating nonreciprocal dispersion characterized by $\omega_p(\bm{q}) \neq
\omega_p(-\bm{q})$. The {\it classical} plasmonic Doppler shift arises from the
polarization of the Fermi surface due to the applied DC bias voltage. Going
beyond this paradigm, we predict a {\it quantum} plasmonic Doppler shift
originating from the quantum metric of the Bloch wavefunction. We
systematically compare the classical and quantum Doppler shifts by
investigating the drift-induced nonreciprocal plasmon dispersion in generic
quantum systems. We demonstrate quantum nonreciprocal plasmons in graphene and
twisted bilayer graphene. We show that the quantum plasmonic Doppler shift
dominates in \moire systems at large wavevectors, yielding plasmonic
nonreciprocity up to 20\% in twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings demonstrate
the supremacy of plasmonic quantum Doppler shift in \moire systems, motivating
the design of innovative nonreciprocal photonic devices with potential
technological implications.

<br>
<i>Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Yicheng Tang, Junhyun Lee, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei, Patrick Azaria</i>
<p>In this work we argue that the antiferromagnetic spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain
in the gapped phase with boundary magnetic fields hosts fractional spin
$\frac{1}{4}$ at its edges. Using a combination of Bethe ansatz and the density
matrix renormalization group we show that these fractional spins are sharp
quantum observables in both the ground and the first excited state as the
associated fractional spin operators have zero variance. In the limit of zero
edge fields, we argue that these fractional spin operators once projected onto
the low energy subspace spanned by the ground state and the first excited
state, identify with the strong zero energy mode discovered by P. Fendley
\cite{Fendley}.

<h3>Superconductivity in correlated carbon nanotubes under pressure: A  Bogoliubov-de Gennes study</h3>

<br>
<i>Germán E. López, Chumin Wang</i>
<p>In contrast to most microscopic theories of superconductivity based on the
reciprocal space, the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism provides a
real-space alternative for addressing inhomogeneous systems. In this article,
we study the superconducting states in correlated single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) with curvature and spin-orbit corrections, as well as the
inter-tube interaction through a connecting molecule using an attractive
Hubbard model. The results reveal a close relationship between the on-site
superconducting gap and the single-electron local density of states. For the
limiting case of independent large-diameter nanotubes, the BdG equations can be
reduced to the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer one with analytical
solutions. Moreover, an optimal separation between nanotubes is found, which
leads to a maximal superconducting critical temperature. This finding has a
remarkable accordance with the experimental data obtained from Buckypapers
built of boron doped SWNTs under external pressure.

<p>Ion transport across solid solid interfaces is often slower than through the
bulk of a material, impeding the charge and discharge rate of batteries.
Designing highly conductive interfaces is challenging due to the need to probe
ion conduction at individual interfaces and correlate it with the local
structure. In this study, we address this challenge by enabling the
simultaneous measurements of local Li-dominated optical phonons and ion
distributions, using high-energy and high-spatial-resolution spectroscopy in a
scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). Further, this method allows
for a direct correlation of ion conduction with interfacial structures
identified by STEM imaging. By examining diverse individual interfaces of
LiCoO2, we reveal the sensitivity of ion conduction to interface atomic-scale
structure and chemistry. Our method enables correlative analysis of ion
transport behavior, and atomic and band structures, and can serve as a robust
experimental approach for identifying interface structures that offer high
conductivity and cyclability for batteries.

<p>Orbitronics is an emerging and fascinating field that explores the
utilization of the orbital degree of freedom of electrons for information
processing. An increasing number of orbital phenomena are being currently
discovered, with spin-orbit coupling mediating the interplay between orbital
and spin effects, thus providing a wealth of control mechanisms and device
applications. In this context, the orbital analog of spin Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), i.e. orbital DMI, deserves to be explored in depth, since it
is believed to be capable of inducing chiral orbital structures. Here, we
unveil the main features and microscopic mechanisms of the orbital DMI in a
two-dimensional square lattice using a tight-binding model of t2g orbitals in
combination with the Berry phase theory. This approach allows us to investigate
and transparently disentangle the role of inversion symmetry breaking, strength
of orbital exchange interaction and spin-orbit coupling in shaping the
properties of the orbital DMI. By scrutinizing the band-resolved contributions
we are able to understand the microscopic mechanisms and guiding principles
behind the orbital DMI and its anisotropy in two dimensional magnetic
materials, and uncover a fundamental relation between the orbital DMI and its
spin counterpart, which is currently explored very intensively. The insights
gained from our work contribute to advancing our knowledge of orbitalrelated
effects and their potential applications in spintronics, providing a path for
future research in the field of chiral orbitronics.

<h3>DFT based investigation of structural, elastic, optoelectronic,  thermophysical and superconducting state properties of binary Mo3P at  different pressures</h3>

<i>Md. Sohel Rana, Razu Ahmed, Md. Sajidul Islam, R.S. Islam, S.H. Naqib</i>
<p>In recent years, the investigation of novel materials for various
technological applications has gained much importance in materials science
research. Tri-molybdenum phosphide (Mo3P), a promising transition metal
phosphide (TMP), has gathered significant attention due to its unique
structural and electronic properties, which already make it potentially
valuable system for catalytic and electronic device applications. Through an
in-depth study using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this
work aims to clarify the basic properties of the Mo3P compound at different
pressures. In this work, we have studied the structural, elastic,
optoelectronic and thermophysical properties of binary Mo3P compound. In this
investigation, we varied uniform hydrostatic pressure from 0 GPa to 30 GPa. A
complete geometrical optimization for structural parameters is performed and
the obtained values are in good accord with the experimental values where
available. It is also found that Mo3P possesses very low level of elastic
anisotropy, reasonably good machinability, ductile nature, relatively high
Vickers hardness, high Debye temperature and high melting temperature.
Thermomechanical properties indicate that the compound has potential to be used
as a thermal barrier coating material. The bonding nature in Mo3P has been
explored. The electronic band structure shows that Mo3P has no band gap and
exhibits conventional metallic behavior. All of the energy dependent optical
characteristics demonstrate apparent metallic behavior and agree exactly with
the electronic density of states calculations. The compound has excellent
reflective and absorptive properties suitable for optical applications.
Pressure dependent variations of the physical properties are explored and their
possible link with superconductivity has been discussed.

<p>We report the discovery of a novel form of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) oxide,
which stands as the first example of long-range, coherent polymorphism in this
class of inorganic solids. Rather than the well-known, uniform stacking of
perovskite blocks ubiquitously found in RP phases, this newly discovered
polymorph of the bilayer RP phase $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$adopts a novel stacking
sequence in which single and trilayer blocks of $NiO_{6}$ octahedra alternate
in a 1313 sequence. Crystals of this new polymorph are described in space group
Cmmm, although we note evidence for a competing Imcm variant. Transport
measurements at ambient pressure reveal metallic character with evidence of a
charge density wave transition with onset at T = 134 K, which lies intermediate
between that of the standard 2222 polymorph of $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$ (space group
Amam) and the trilayer RP phase, $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$. The discovery of such
polymorphism could reverberate to the expansive range of science and
applications that rely on RP materials, particularly the recently reported
signatures of superconductivity with $T_{c}$ as high as 80 K above 14 GPa in
bilayer $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$.

<h3>Enhancing carrier transfer properties of Na-rich anti-perovskites,  Na4OM2 with tetrahedral anion groups: an evaluation through first-principles  computational analysis</h3>

<br>
<i>Shenglin Xu, Qinfu Zhao, Ronglan Zhang, Bingbing Suo, Qi Song</i>
<p>The practical application of Na-based solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) is
limited by their low level of conduction. To evaluate the impact of tetrahedral
anion groups on carrier migration, we designed a set of anti-perovskite SSEs
theoretically based on the previously reported Na4OBr2, including Na4O(BH4)2,
Na4O(BF4)2, and Na4O(AlH4)2. It is essential to note that the excessive radius
of anionic groups inevitably leads to lattice distortion, resulting in
asymmetric migration paths and a limited improvement in carrier migration rate.
Na4O(AlH4)2 provides a clear example of where Na migrates in two distinct
environments. In addition, due to different spatial charge distributions, the
interaction strength between anionic groups and Na is different. Strong
interactions can cause carriers to appear on a swing, leading to a decrease in
conductivity. The low conductivity of Na4O(BF4)2 is a typical example. This
study demonstrates that Na4O(BH4)2 exhibits remarkable mechanical and dynamic
stability and shows ionic conductivity, two orders of magnitude higher than
that of Na4OBr2. This is attributed to the expansion of the carrier migration
channels by the anion groups, the moderate interaction between carriers and
anionic groups, and the paddle-wheel effect generated by the anion groups,
indicating that the paddle-wheel effect is still effective in low-dimensional
anti-perovskite structures, in which atoms are arranged asymmetrically.

<p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity above 240 K in binary
La-H and Y-H systems inspired further predictions of even higher transition
temperatures in compounds such as YH10 and MgH6, which are likely to be
dynamically unstable. Ternary superhydrides provide alternative pathways to
stabilize desired near-room temperature superconducting phases. However, the
synthesis of new ternary hydrides remains challenging because most of the
precursor reactants do not exist in desired stoichiometry at ambient
conditions. Here we report that using the existing binary intermetallic CaMg2
and 1:1 Ca-Mg mixture as starting reactants, we have successfully synthesized
novel Ca-Mg-based ternary superhydrides at megabar pressures. Electrical
resistivity measurements show Tc approaching 168 K at 310 GPa in the

<p>We discuss rapidly rotating states of a superfluid. We concentrate on the
Giant-Vortex (GV) state, which is a coherent rotating solution with a
macroscopic hole at the center. We show that, for any trap, the fluctuations
obey an approximately chiral dispersion relation, describing arbitrary shape
deformations moving with the speed of the ambient superfluid. This dispersion
relation is a consequence of a peculiar infinite symmetry group that emerges at
large angular velocity and implies an infinite ground-state degeneracy. The
degeneracy is lifted by small corrections which we determine both for smooth
traps and the hard trap.

<br>
<i>Marco Aurelio Galvani Cunha, John C. Crocker, Andrea J. Liu</i>
<p>The mechanical properties of biopolymer networks depend on their mean
coordination number and stress state. Models based on spring networks have been
shown to capture some properties of materials such as the actin cortex, but the
effect of prestress combined with filament pruning, known to exist in the
cortex, has not been studied. We show that in central-force spring networks
below isostatic coordination that are rigidified by prestress, details of the
pruning method significantly affect mechanical properties: networks pruned by a
tension-inhibited method not only have a larger shear modulus than
randomly-pruned networks, but require far smaller initial prestrains in order
to remain rigid at biologically-relevant coordinations. These findings suggest
a possible reason for the common motif of tension-inhibited filament-cleaving
proteins in biopolymer networks.

<i>Fan Liu, Xi Lin, Yuting Yan, Xuetao Gan, Yingchun Cheng, Xiaoguang Luo</i>
<p>Tunable photovoltaic photodetectors are of significant relevance in the
fields of programmable and neuromorphic optoelectronics. However, their
widespread adoption is hindered by intricate architectural design and energy
consumption challenges. This study employs a nonvolatile MoTe2/hBN/graphene
semi-floating photodetector to address these issues. Programed with pulsed gate
voltage, the MoTe2 channel can be reconfigured from an n+-n to a p-n
homojunction, and the photocurrent transition changes from negative to positive
values. Scanning photocurrent mapping reveals that the negative and positive
photocurrents are attributed to Schottky junction and p-n homojunction,
respectively. In the p-n configuration, the device demonstrates self-driven,
linear, rapid response (~3 ms), and broadband sensitivity (from 405 to 1500 nm)
for photodetection, with typical performances of responsivity at ~0.5 A/W and
detectivity ~1.6*10^12 Jones under 635 nm illumination. These outstanding
photodetection capabilities emphasize the potential of the semi-floating
photodetector as a pioneering approach for advancing logical and nonvolatile

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) material photodetectors have gained great attention as
potential elements for optoelectronic applications. However, the linearity of
the photoresponse is often compromised by the carrier interaction, even in 2D
photodiodes. In this study, we present a new device concept of dual-floating
van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) photodiode by employing ambipolar MoTe2
and n-type MoS2 2D semiconductors. The presence of type II heterojunctions on
both sides of channel layers effectively deplete carriers and restrict the
photocarrier trapping within the channel layers. As a result, the device
exhibits robust linear photoresponse under photovoltaic mode from the visible
(405 nm) to near-infrared (1600 nm) band. With the built-in electric field of
the vdWHs, we achieve a linear dynamic range of ~ 100 dB, responsivity of ~
1.57 A/W, detectivity of ~ 4.28 * 10^11 Jones, and response speed of ~ 30
{\mu}s. Our results showcase a promising device concept with excellent
linearity towards fast and low-loss detection, high-resolution imaging, and

<i>Song-Jin O</i>
<p>We propose a novel scheme for combining efficiently the truncated-unity
functional renormalization group (TUFRG) and the mean-field theory. It follows
a method of Wang, Eberlein and Metzner that uses only the two-particle
irreducible part of the vertex as an input for the mean-field treatment. In the
TUFRG, the neglect of fluctuation effects from other channels in the
symmetry-broken regime is represented by applying the random phase
approximation (RPA) in each individual channel, below the divergence scale.
Then the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the four-point vertex is translated into
the RPA matrix equations for the bosonic propagators that relates the singular
and irreducible singular modes of the propagators. The universal symmetries for
the irreducible singular modes are obtained from the antisymmetry of Grassmann
variables. The mean-field equation based on these modes is derived by the
saddle-point approximation in the framework of the path-integral formalism. By
using our scheme, the power of the TUFRG, as an unbiased tool for identifying
the many-body instabilities, could be elevated to a quantitative level, and its
application would be extended to a quantitative analysis of the coexisting
orders. As an illustration we employ this scheme to study the coexistence phase
of the chiral superconductivity and the chiral spin-density wave, predicted
near van Hove filling of the honeycomb lattice.

<h3>Universality of Anderson Localization Transitions in the Integer and  Fractional Quantum Hall Regime</h3>

<i>Simrandeep Kaur, Tanima Chanda, Kazi Rafsanjani Amin, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Unmesh Ghorai, Yuval Gefen, G. J. Sreejith, Aveek Bid</i>
<p>Understanding the interplay between electronic interactions and
disorder-induced localization has been a longstanding quest in the physics of
quantum materials. One of the most convincing demonstrations of the scaling
theory of localization for noninteracting electrons has come from plateau
transitions in the integer quantum Hall effect with short-range disorder,
wherein the localization length diverges as the critical filling factor is
approached with a measured scaling exponent close to the theoretical estimates.
In this work, we extend this physics to the fractional quantum Hall effect, a
paradigmatic phenomenon arising from a confluence of interaction, disorder, and
topology. We employ high-mobility trilayer graphene devices where the transport
is dominated by short-range impurity scattering, and the extent of Landau level
mixing can be varied by a perpendicular electric field. Our principal finding
is that the plateau-to-plateau transitions from N+1/3 to N+2/5 and from N+2/5
to N+3/7 fractional states are governed by a universal scaling exponent, which
is identical to that for the integer plateau transitions and is independent of
the perpendicular electric field. These observations and the values of the
critical filling factors are consistent with a description in terms of Anderson
localization-delocalization transitions of weakly interacting electron-flux
bound states called composite Fermions. This points to a universal effective
physics underlying fractional and integer plateau-to-plateau transitions
independent of the quasiparticle statistics of the phases and unaffected by
weak Landau level mixing. Besides clarifying the conditions for the realization
of the scaling regime for composite fermions, the work opens the possibility of
exploring a wide variety of plateau transitions realized in graphene, including
the fractional anomalous Hall phases and non-abelian FQH states.

<i>Saba Karimi, Junjie Yin, Thomas Salez, James A Forrest</i>
<p>We measure the isothermal rejuvenation of stable glass films of poly(styrene)
and poly(methylmethacrylate). We demonstrate that the propagation of the front
responsible for the transformation to a supercooled-liquid state can serve as a
highly localized probe of the local supercooled dynamics. We use this
connection to probe the depth-dependent relaxation rate with nanometric
precision for a series of polystyrene films over a range of temperatures near
the bulk glass transition temperature. The analysis shows the spatial extent of
enhanced surface mobility and reveals the existence of an unexpected large
dynamical length scale in the system. The results are compared with the
cooperative-string model for glassy dynamics. The data reveals that the
film-thickness dependence of whole film properties arises only from the volume
fraction of the near-surface region. While the dynamics at the middle of the
samples shows the expected bulk-like temperature dependence, the near-surface
region shows very little dependence on temperature.

<h3>Giant ferroelectric polarization in ZrO2 thin film enhanced by an  AFE-to-FE phase transition</h3>

<i>Xianglong Li, Zengxu Xu, Songbai Hu, Mingqiang Gu, Yuanmin Zhu, Qi Liu, Yihao Yang, Mao Ye, Lang Chen</i>
<p>Ferroelectric fluorite oxides like hafnium (HfO2)-based materials are
considered to be one of the most potential candidates for nowadays large-scale
integrated-circuits owing to their high compatibility with silicon-based
technology. While zirconia (ZrO2)-based fluorites materials, which holds the
same fluorite structure, is usually thought to be anti- or week ferroelectric.
Our study demonstrates a giant ferroelectric remanent polarization (Pr)
amounted to 53 uC/cm2 in orthorhombic ZrO2 growing on (110) SrTiO3, which is
comparable to those most outstanding HfO2-based materials. We believe this
giant remanent polarization stems from the irreversible
anti-ferroelectric-to-ferroelectric (AFE-to-FE) phase transition activated by
electric field, which converts the as-grown anti-ferroelectric-ferroelectric
blends into purely ferroelectric ZrO2. Our study reverses the poor
ferroelectric opinion on ZrO2 by promoting the Pr to the best HfO2-based
materials level.

<h3>Special flow model for passive particle transport considering internal  noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06218</a>
<br>
<i>Boris S. Maryshev, Lyudmila S. Klimenko</i>
<p>We have generalized the semi-analytic approach of special flow to the
description of flows of passive particles taking into account internal noise.
The model is represented by a series of recurrence relations. The recurrence
relations are constructed by numerically solving the Langevin equations in the
presence of a random force, for an ensemble of passive particles during
transport through a secluded cell. This approach allows us to estimate the
transit time dependence near stagnation points for fluid elements carried by
the flow. Such estimates are obtained for the most important types of
stagnation points. It is shown that macroscopic transport of an ensemble of
particles through such a lattice is possible only when internal noise is taken
into account. For Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise at low intensity the transit
time has one peak, which is a consequence of the existence of vortices of one
stagnation point. Increase of noise intensity leads to slowing down of particle
transport.

<h3>Development of travelling heater method for growth of detector grade  CdZnTe single crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06233" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06233</a>
<br>
<i>P.Vijayakumar, Edward Prabu Amaladass K.Ganesan R.M.Sarguna, Varsha Roy, S. Ganesamoorthy</i>
<p>We report on the indigenous design and development of laboratory scale
travelling heater method (THM) system to grow detector grade Cd0.9Zn0.1Te
(CdZnTe) single crystals. THM system mainly consists of two-zone furnace with a
tuneable temperature gradient (30 - 80 C/cm), high precision translation (1 -
25 mm per day) and rotation (1 - 50 rpm) assemblies to meet the stringent
conditions that are essential to grow detector grade CdZnTe single crystals.
Further, a load cell in the THM system enables continuous monitoring of the
growth. Systematic growth experiments were performed to optimize the various
growth parameters in order to achieve large grain single crystals. Herein, the
effect of temperature gradient and growth rate on the increase in grain size is
discussed in detail. Each successful growth experiment yields a minimum of four
detector grade elements of dimensions 10 x 10 x 5 mm3 from a starting charge of
100 g of CdZnTe. The crystalline nature and quality of the detector elements
were evaluated using Laue, NIR transmission spectroscopy and I-V
characteristics. Crystals with resistivity greater than ~ 1-10 giga-ohm-cm were
identified for testing gamma ray detection. The photo peak of 137Cs was
resolved with an energy resolution of 4.2 % at 662 keV and its measured
electron mobility lifetime product is found to be ~ 3.3 x 10-3 cm2/V. The
demonstration of the gamma ray detection with a relatively high {\mu}{\tau}
product is the testimony to the successful growth of detector grade CdZnTe
single crystals by an indigenously developed THM system.

<br>
<i>Giorgio Nicoletti, Daniel Maria Busiello</i>
<p>Complex systems are characterized by multiple spatial and temporal scales. A
natural framework to capture their multiscale nature is that of multilayer
networks, where different layers represent distinct physical processes that
often regulate each other indirectly. We model these regulatory mechanisms
through triadic higher-order interactions between nodes and edges. In this
work, we focus on how the different timescales associated with each layer
impact their effective couplings in terms of their mutual information. We
unravel the general principles governing how such information propagates across
the multiscale structure, and apply them to study archetypal examples of
biological signaling networks and effective environmental dependencies in
stochastic processes. Our framework generalizes to any dynamics on multilayer
networks, paving the way for a deeper understanding of how the multiscale
nature of real-world systems shapes their information content and complexity.

<br>
<i>Ningyi Li, Junhong Li, Lijingting Qing, Shicheng Ma, Yao Li, Baohui Li</i>
<p>At low temperatures, colloidal particles with short-range attractive and
long-range repulsive interactions can form various periodic microphases in
bulk.In this paper, we investigate the self-assembly behaviour of colloids with
competing interactions under spherical confinement by conducting molecular
dynamics simulations. We find that the cluster, mixture, cylindrical,
perforated lamellar and lamellar structures can be obtained, but the details of
the ordered structures are different from those in bulk systems. Interestingly,
the system tends to form more perforated structures when confined in smaller
spheres. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is the relationship between the
energy of the ordered structures and the bending of the confinement wall, which
is different from the mechanism in copolymer systems.

<h3>Electrically Tunable Fine Structure of Negatively Charged Excitons in  Gated Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots</h3>

<br>
<i>Katarzyna Sadecka, Yasser Saleem, Daniel Miravet, Matthew Albert, Marek Korkusinski, Gabriel Bester, Pawel Hawrylak</i>
<p>We predict here the fine structure of an electrically tunable negatively
charged exciton (trion) composed of two electrons and a hole confined in a
gated bilayer graphene quantum dot (QD). We start with an atomistic approach,
allowing us to compute confined electron and confined hole QD states for a
structure containing over one million atoms. Using atomistic wavefunctions we
compute Coulomb matrix elements and self-energies. In the next step, by solving
the Bethe-Salpeter-like equation for trions, we describe a negatively charged
exciton, built as a strongly interacting interlayer complex of two electrons in
the conduction band and one hole in the valence band. Unlike in conventional
semiconducting QDs, we show that the trion contains a fine structure composed
of ten states arising from the valley and spin degrees of freedom. Finally, we
obtain absorption into and emission from the trion states. We predict the
existence of bright low-energy states and propose to extract the fine structure
of the trion using the temperature dependence of emission spectra.

<h3>Polyhedrons from Diblock Copolymer Solutions Confined in Spherical  Nanopores</h3>

<br>
<i>Jiaping Wu, Xin Wang, Zheng Wang, Yuhua Yin, Run Jiang, Yao Li, Baohui Li</i>
<p>Self-assembly of sphere-forming solution-state amphiphilic diblock copolymers
under spherical nanopore confinement is investigated using a simulated
annealing technique. For two types of cases of different pore-surface/copolymer
interactions, sequences of self-assembled patchy nanospheres are obtained, and
phase diagrams are constructed. Self-assembled patchy nanospheres with 1-21
solvophobic domains are observed. The outermost solvophobic domains (patches)
are packed into various polyhedrons when their number is larger than 3, where
three Platonic solids of a regular tetrahedron, an octahedron, and an
icosahedron and seven Johnson solids of J12, J13, J17, J50, J51, J86, and J87
are identified. In addition, another Johnson solid of J84 is identified in a
structure with two categories of B-domains. These polyhedrons have all or most
of their faces in a triangular shape, and hence, they are closer to spherical
in shape, which may relieve the chain stretching. Nanospheres with 1, 4, 6, 9,
and 12 numbers of patches occur in relatively large windows in the phase
diagrams of both types of cases. In one of the two types of cases, all
nanospheres with any number of 1-14 patches occur in the phase diagram, whereas
in the other type of cases, nanospheres with 2, 3, 5, 11, and 13 numbers of
patches are absent in the phase diagram. Furthermore, at a given pore size, the
number of patches changes nonmonotonically or is unchanged with an increase in
the strength of the pore-surface/copolymer interactions for one type or the
other type of case, respectively. Quantitative calculations are performed to
elucidate mechanisms of the window size in the phase diagrams of nanospheres
with different numbers of patches and structure details.

<p>We investigate the long-range behavior and size dependence of the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in hexagonal and triangular
graphene nanoflakes with zigzag and arm-chair edges. We employ the
tight-binding model with exact diagonalization to calculate the RKKY
interaction as a function of the distance between magnetic impurities,
nanoflake size, and edge geometry. Our findings demonstrate a strong dependency
of the RKKY interaction on edge geometry and flake size, with notable changes
in the RKKY interaction strength. We further analyze the influence of
structural defects on the interaction strength of exchange interactions.

<h3>Static magnetic order with strong quantum fluctuations in spin-1/2  honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6</h3>

<p>Kitaev interaction, an interplay from frustrated bond anisotropy, can lead to
strong quantum fluctuations and thus quantum spin liquid state in an ideal
Kitaev model. However, the presence of the non-Kitaev interactions usually
promotes the ground state to a zigzag antiferromagnetic order in d-orbital
transition metal Kitaev candidates. Combining with the neutron scattering and
the muon-spin rotation and relaxation techniques, we provided further insights
into nature of the exotic properties of Na2Co2TeO6, and found that the
zero-field muon-spin relaxation rate becomes approximately constant with a
value close to 0.45 us-1 at temperatures below TN. Such a
temperature-independent muon-spin relaxation rate is most likely attributed to
the presence of strong quantum fluctuations as well as the frustrated Kitaev
interaction. As the magnetic field is increased, a spin-wave-excitation gap at
K-point becomes much broader. Therefore, the quantum fluctuations are quite
robust and even can be enhanced by applying magnetic field, which would help us
further understand the possible quantum-spin-liquid state in a Kitaev
candidate.

<h3>Towards a phase diagram of the topologically frustrated XY chain</h3>

<p>Landau theory's implicit assumption that microscopic details cannot affect
the system's phases has been challenged only recently in systems such as
antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains with periodic boundary conditions, where
topological frustration can be induced. In this work, we show that the latter
modifies the zero temperature phase diagram of the XY chain in a transverse
magnetic field by inducing new quantum phase transitions. In doing so, we come
across the first case of second order boundary quantum phase transition
characterized by a quartic dispersion relation. Our analytical results are
supported by numerical investigations and lay the foundation for understanding
the phase diagram of this frustrated model.

<h3>A generalized Dean-Kawasaki equation for an interacting Brownian gas in  a partially absorbing medium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06294" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06294</a>
<br>
<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<p>The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation is a stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE) for the global density $\rho$ of a gas of $N$ over-damped Brownian
particles. In the thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ with weak pairwise
interactions, the expectation ${\mathbb E}[\rho]$ converges in distribution to
the solution of a McKean-Vlasov (MV) equation. In this paper we derive a
generalized DK equation for an interacting Brownian gas in a partially
absorbing one-dimensional medium. In the case of the half-line with a totally
reflecting boundary at $x=0$, the generalized DK equation is an SPDE for the
joint global density
$\rho(x,\ell,t)=N^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^N\delta(x-X_j(t))\delta(\ell-L_j(t))$, where
$X_j(t)$ and $L_j(t)$ denote the position and local time of the $j$th particle,
respectively. Assuming the DK equation has a well-defined mean field limit, we
derive the MV equation on the half-line with a reflecting boundary, and analyze
stationary solutions for a Curie-Weiss (quadratic) interaction potential. We
then use an encounter-based approach to develop the analogous theory for a
partially absorbing boundary at $x=0$. Each particle is independently absorbed
when its local time $L_j(t)$ exceeds a random threshold $\widehat{\ell}_j$ with
probability distribution $\Psi(\ell)=\P[\widehat{\ell}_j>\ell]$. The joint
global density is now summed over the set of particles that have not yet been
absorbed, and expectations are taken with respect to the Gaussian noise and the
random thresholds $\widehat{\ell}_j$. Extensions to finite intervals and
partially absorbing traps are also considered.

<h3>New approach to extract important degrees of freedom in quantum dynamics  using singular value decomposition: Application to linear optical spectrum in  two-dimensional Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06300</a>
<br>
<i>J. Tokimoto, S. Ohmura, A. Takahashi</i>
<p>We propose a new approach to extract the important degrees of freedom in
quantum dynamics induced by an external stimulus. We calculate the coefficient
matrix numerically, where the $i-l$ element of the matrix is the coefficient of
the lth basis state at the ith discretized time in the solution of the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation induced by the external stimulus. By
performing a randomized singular value decomposition of the coefficient matrix,
a practically exact solution is obtained using a linear combination of the
important modes, where the number of modes is much smaller than the dimensions
of the Hilbert space in many cases. We apply this method to analysis of the
light absorption spectrum in two-dimensional (2D) Mott insulators using an
effective model of the 2D Hubbard model in the strong interaction case. From
the dynamics induced by an ultrashort weak light pulse, we find that the
practically exact light absorption spectrum can be reproduced by as few as 1000
energy eigenstates in the $1.7 \times 10^{7}$-dimension Hilbert space of a
26-site cluster. These one-photon active energy eigenstates are classified into
free holon and doublon (H-D) and localized H-D states. In the free H-D states,
the main effect of the spin degrees of freedom on the transfer of a holon (H)
and a doublon (D) is the phase shift, and the H and the D move freely. In the
localized H-D states, an H and a D are localized with relative distances of
$\sqrt{5}$ or $\sqrt{13}$. The antiferromagnetic (AF) spin orders in the
localized H-D states are much stronger than those in the free H-D states, and
the charge localization is of magnetic origin. There are sharp peaks caused by
excitations to the localized H-D states below the broad band caused by
excitations to the free H-D states in the light absorption spectrum.

<p>Metal halide perovskite solar cells being one of the fastest emerging
technologies for renewable energy still has to become more industry friendly in
a way that will allow using it for thin film modules or tandems with
conventional silicon devices. The simplest way to achieve this is to use
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique for tandem production. In this work,
we show a method for a single step production of MAPbI3 films in a simple
two-zone CVD reactor from lead diacetate and methyl-ammonium iodide powders.
Obtained films show highly ordered cubic MAPbI3 phase with a thickness of
400-500 um, good photoluminescence response and absorption band edge similar to
spin-coated film. We used those films to produce p-i-n solar cells with
ITO/NiO/MAPbI3/C60/Cu structure. The best cell showed negligible 0.23 % PCE
right after the manufacturing but significantly improved to 5.5 % PCE after 8
hours of storage in the dark. The main limiting factor affecting the efficiency
is low current density, which we attribute to non-optimized growth conditions;
however, our approach is a first step to a single step CVD deposition of MAPbI3
on any type of substrates including texturized silicon subcells for better
overall efficiency.

<i>M. Roldão, J. L. Figueiredo, P. Monteiro, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</i>
<p>The quantum diffusion of a vortex in a two-component quantum fluid of light
is investigated. In these systems, the Kerr nonlinearity promotes interactions
between the photons, displaying features that are analogue of a Bose-Einstein
condensates. Quantum fluids of light have the advantage of simulating
matter-wave phenomena at room temperatures. While the analogy is true at the
mean field level, the full quantum dynamics of an impurity in quantum fluids of
light of, and therefore the ability of featuring genuine quantum noise, has
never been considered. We numerically solve the problem by simulating a
vortex-like impurity in the presence of noise with the Bogoliubov spectral
density, and show that the vortex undergoes superdiffusion. We support our
results with a theory that has been previously developed for the brownian
motion of point-like particles.

<h3>Inelastic Light Scattering in the Vicinity of a Single-Atom Quantum  Point Contact in a Plasmonic Picocavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06339</a>
<br>
<i>Shuyi Liu, Franco P. Bonafe, Heiko Appel, Angel Rubio, Martin Wolf, Takashi Kumagai</i>
<p>Here, using low-temperature optical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we
investigate inelastic light scattering (ILS) in the vicinity of a single-atom
quantum point contact (QPC). A vibration mode localized at the single Ag adatom
on the Ag(111) surface is resolved in the ILS spectrum, resulting from
tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) by the atomically-confined plasmonic field
in the STM junction. Furthermore, we trace how TERS from the single adatom
evolves as a function of the gap distance. The exceptional stability of the
low-temperature STM allows to examine distinctly different electron transport
regimes of the picocavity, namely in the tunneling and quantum point contact
(QPC) regimes. This measurement shows that the vibration mode localized at the
adatom and its TERS intensity exhibits a sharp change upon the QPC formation,
indicating that the atomic-level structure has a crucial impact on the
plasmonic properties. To gain microscopic insights into picocavity
optomechanics, we scrutinize the structure and plasmonic field in the STM
junction using time-dependent density functional theory. The simulations reveal
that atomic-scale structural relaxation at the single-atom QPC results in a
discrete change of the plasmonic field strength, volume, and distribution as
well as the vibration mode localized at the single atom. These findings give a
qualitative explanation for the experimental observations. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that strong ILS is a characteristic feature of QPC by continuously
forming, breaking, and reforming the atomic contact, and how the plasmonic
resonance evolves throughout the non-tunneling, tunneling, and QPC regimes.

<h3>How do particles with complex interactions self-assemble?</h3>

<br>
<i>Lara Koehler, Pierre Ronceray, Martin Lenz</i>
<p>In living cells, proteins self-assemble into large functional structures
based on specific interactions between molecularly complex patches. Due to this
complexity, protein self-assembly results from a competition between a large
number of distinct interaction energies, of the order of one per pair of
patches. Current self-assembly models however typically ignore this aspect, and
the principles by which it determines the large-scale structure of protein
assemblies are largely unknown. Here, we use Monte-Carlo simulations and
machine learning to start to unravel these principles. We observe that despite
widespread geometrical frustration, aggregates of particles with complex
interactions fall within only a few categories that often display high degrees
of spatial order, including crystals, fibers, and micelles. We then
successfully identify the most relevant aspect of the interaction complexity in
predicting these outcomes, namely the particles' ability to form periodic
structures. Our results provide a first characterization of the rich design
space associated with identical particles with complex interactions, and could
inspire engineered self-assembling nanoobjects as well as help understand the
emergence of robust functional protein structures.

<p>We consider the ISM of flocking and swarming. The model has been introduced
to explain certain dynamic features of swarming (second sound, a lower than
expected dynamic critical exponent) while preserving the mechanism for onset of
order provided by the Vicsek model. The ISM has only been formulated with an
imitation (''ferromagnetic'') interaction between velocities. Here we show how
to add position-dependent forces in the model, which allows to consider effects
such as cohesion, excluded volume, confinement and perturbation with external
position-dependent field. We study numerically a one-particle case.

<i>Yubing Du, Guoshuai Du, Hongliang Dong, Jiayin Li, Wuxiao Han, Bin Chen, Yabin Chen</i>
<p>The modern very large-scale integration systems based on silicon
semiconductor are facing the unprecedented challenges especially when
transistor feature size lowers further, due to the excruciating tunneling
effect and thermal management. Besides the common diamond cubic silicon,
numerous exotic silicon allotropes with outstanding properties can emerge under
high pressure, such as the metastable BC8 and metallic \b{eta}-tin structures.
Despite much effort on the controlled synthesis in experiment and theory, the
effective approach to rationally prepare Si phases with desired purity is still
lacking and their transition mechanism remains controversial. Herein, we
systematically investigated on the complicated structural transformations of Si
under extreme conditions, and efficiently enriched BC8-Si phase via dynamic
decompression strategy. The splendid purity of BC8-Si was achieved up to ~95%,
evidently confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We
believe these results can shed a light on the controlled preparation of Si
metastable phases and their potential applications in nanoelectronics.

properties of monolayer penta-NiN$_2$. Our results reveal a quasiparticle band
gap of approximately 1 eV within the eigenvalue self-consistent $GW$ approach,
corroborating the monolayer penta-NiN$_2$'s potential in optoelectronics.
Remarkably, the acoustic phonon-limited carrier mobility for the monolayer
penta-NiN$_2$ exhibits an ultra-high hole mobility of $84{\times}10^4$
cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the material's band
gap exhibits an anomalous negative dependence on temperature. Despite being a
two-dimensional material, monolayer penta-NiN$_2$ presents resonant excitons in
its most prominent absorption peak. Therefore, penta-NiN$_2$ boasts compelling
and promising properties that merit exploration in optoelectronics and
high-speed devices.

<h3>Nanoscale strain manipulation of smectic susceptibility in kagome  superconductors</h3>

<p>Exotic quantum solids can host electronic states that spontaneously break
rotational symmetry of the electronic structure, such as electronic nematic
phases and unidirectional charge density waves (CDWs). When electrons couple to
the lattice, uniaxial strain can be used to anchor and control this electronic
directionality. Here we reveal an unusual impact of strain on unidirectional
"smectic" CDW orders in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 using
spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. We discover local
decoupling between the smectic electronic director axis and the direction of
anisotropic strain. While the two are generally aligned along the same
direction in regions of small CDW gap, the two become misaligned in regions
where CDW gap is the largest. This in turn suggests nanoscale variations in
smectic susceptibility, which we attribute to a combination of local strain and
electron correlation strength. Overall, we observe an unusually high decoupling
rate between the smectic electronic director of the 3-state Potts order and
anisotropic strain, revealing weak smecto-elastic coupling in the CDW phase of
kagome superconductors. This is phenomenologically different from the
extensively studied nemato-elastic coupling in the Ising nematic phase of
Fe-based superconductors, providing a contrasting picture of how strain can
control electronic unidirectionality in different families of quantum
materials.

<p>Gatemon qubits are the electrically tunable cousins of superconducting
transmon qubits. In this work, we demonstrate the full coherent control of a
gatemon qubit based on hole carriers in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire, with the
longest coherence times in group IV material gatemons to date. The key to these
results is a high-quality Josephson junction obtained in a straightforward and
reproducible annealing technique. We demonstrate that the transport through the
narrow junctions is dominated by only two quantum channels, with transparencies
up to unity. This novel qubit platform holds great promise for quantum
information applications, not only because it incorporates technologically
relevant materials, but also because it provides new opportunities, like an
ultrastrong spin-orbit coupling in the few-channel regime of Josephson
junctions.

<h3>Probing photo-induced granular superconductivity in K$_{3}$C$_{60}$ thin  films with an ultrafast on-chip voltmeter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06421" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06421</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph D. Adelinia, Eryin Wang, Mariana Chavez-Cervantes, Toru Matsuyama, Michael Fechner, Michele Buzzi, Guido Meier, Andrea Cavalleri</i>
<p>The physics of optically-induced superconductivity remains poorly understood,
with questions that range from the underlying microscopic mechanism to the
macroscopic electrical response of the non-equilibrium phase. In this paper, we
study optically-induced superconductivity in K$_{3}$C$_{60}$ thin films, which
display signatures of granularity both in the equilibrium state below T$_{c}$
and in the nonequilibrium photo-induced phase above T$_{c}$. Photo-conductive
switches are used to measure the ultrafast voltage drop across a
K$_{3}$C$_{60}$ film as a function of time after irradiation, both below and
above T$_{c}$. These measurements reveal fast changes associated with the
kinetic inductance of in-grain superconductivity, and a slower response
attributed to the Josephson dynamics at the weak links. Fits to the data yield
estimates of the in-grain photo-induced superfluid density after the drive and
the dynamics of phase slips at the weak links. This work underscores the
increasing ability to make electrical measurements at ultrafast speeds in
optically-driven quantum materials, and demonstrates a striking new platform
for optoelectronic device applications.

<h3>Dynamical exciton condensates in biased electron-hole bilayers</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhiyuan Sun, Yuta Murakami, Tatsuya Kaneko, Denis Golež, Andrew J. Millis</i>
<p>Bilayer materials may support interlayer excitons comprised of electrons in
one layer and holes in the other. In experiments, a non-zero exciton density is
typically sustained by a bias chemical potential, implemented either by optical
pumping or by electrical contacts connected to the two layers. We show that if
charge can tunnel between the layers, the chemical potential bias means that an
exciton condensate is in the dynamical regime of ac Josephson effect. It has
physical consequences such as tunneling currents and the ability to tune a
condensate from bright (emitting coherent photons) to dark by experimental
controlling knobs. If the system is placed in an optical cavity, coupling with
cavity photons favors different dynamical states depending on the bias,
realizing superradiant phases.

<h3>Effects of coordination and stiffness scale-separation in disordered  elastic networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Edan Lerner</i>
<p>Many fibrous materials are modeled as elastic networks featuring a
substantial separation between the stiffness scales that characterize different
microscopic deformation modes of the network's constituents. This scale
separation has been shown to give rise to emergent complexity in these systems'
linear and nonlinear mechanical response. Here we study numerically a simple
model featuring said stiffness scale-separation in two-dimensions and show that
its mechanical response is governed by the competition between the
characteristic stiffness of collective nonphononic soft modes of the stiff
subsystem, and the characteristic stiffness of the soft interactions. We
present and rationalize the behavior of the shear modulus of our complex
networks across the unjamming transition at which the stiff subsystem alone
loses its macroscopic mechanical rigidity. We further establish a relation in
the soft-interaction-dominated regime between the shear modulus, the
characteristic frequency of nonphononic vibrational modes, and the mesoscopic
correlation length that marks the crossover between a disorder-dominated
response to local mechanical perturbations in the near-field, and a linear,
continuum-like response in the far field. The effects of spatial dimension on
the observed scaling behavior are discussed, in addition to the interplay
between stiffness scales in strain-stiffened networks, which are relevant to
the nonlinear mechanics of non-Brownian biopolymer networks.

<h3>Uncovering high-dimensional phase space and the application of Mixture  of Experts (MoE) on building the Large CALPHAD Model (LCM)</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhengdi Liu, Wenwen Sun</i>
<p>This study presents a novel approach for analyzing and establishing Large
CALPHAD model (LCM) in complex alloy systems. Through the introduction of
"composition space volume", a multi-dimensional metric which allows to
quatitatively define alloy composition variations. Utilizing stochastic
methods, the study quantifies phase space complexity through phase density, and
model training costs through data density. This leads to a strategic
segmentation of the entire composition space, tailored to the complexity of
each segment, thereby reducing computational efforts in model training. A
significant advancement is the integration of segmented models using a Mixture
of Experts (MoE) approach, ensuring accurate portrayal of phase behaviors
across diverse composition spaces. This technique is demonstrated in
establishing a high-dimensional phase diagram for the FeCoNiTi system,
highlighting its efficiency and accuracy. The study's methodologies offer a
systematic and cost-effective framework for modeling complex alloy systems,
marking a step forward in the field of alloy design and analysis.

<h3>Spin-polarized nearly-free electron channels on the Ca$_{2}$N,  electrenes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06447</a>
<br>
<i>P. H. Souza, J. E. Padilha, R. H. Miwa</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials combined with the presence of surface
nearly-free electrons (NFE) have been considered quite interesting platforms to
be exploited for the development of 2D electronic devices. Further
incorporation of foreign elements adds a new degree of freedom to engineer the
electronic as well as the magnetic properties of 2D materials. Here we have
performed an ab-initio study of Ca$_{2}$N, electrenes fully (i.e., both sides)
adsorbed by hydrogen (H/Ca$_{2}$N/H) and fluorine (F/Ca$_{2}$N/F) atoms. The
NFE states are suppressed in these systems, followed by the appearance of a net
magnetic moment localized in the nitrogen atoms intercalated by the
hydrogenated or fluorinated calcium layers. In the sequence, we have proposed
lateral heterostructures combining the H/Ca$_{2}$N/H or F/Ca$_{2}$N/F regions
with pristine Ca$_{2}$N, electrenes [(Ca$_{2}$N)(X/Ca$_{2}$N/X), with X=H or
F]. We found that the magnetic moment of the hydrogenated or fluorinated
regions promotes the emergence of spin-polarized NFE states confined along the
pristine (Ca$_{2}$N) stripes. Further electronic transport calculations reveal
that the (X/Ca$_{2}$N/X) regions act as spin-dependent scattering centers,
spin-filters. We believe that these findings make an important contribution to
the development of spintronic devices based on 2D electrides.

<h3>Comparison of time-of-flight with MIEZE spectroscopy of H$_2$O:  Necessity to go beyond the spin-echo approximation</h3>

<i>L. Beddrich, P. Bender, L. Spitz, A. Wendl, C. Franz, S. Busch, C. Pfleiderer, O. Soltwedel, J. K. Jochum</i>
<p>Here, we discuss the comparability of data acquisitioned with the Modulation
of IntEnsity with Zero Effort data, a neutron spin-echo (NSE) technique to
neutron Time-of-Flight (ToF) spectroscopy data. As a NSE technique MIEZE
records the intermediate scattering function $\mathcal{I}(Q, \tau)$ making it
necessary to perform a Fourier transform to directly compare it to $S(Q, E)$,
measured by ToF spectroscopy. Transforming either data set into the
complementary parameter space requires detailed knowledge of detector
efficiency, instrumental resolution, and background. We discuss these aspects
by comparing measurements on pure water performed on the spectrometers RESEDA
and TOFTOF under the same experimental conditions. Additionally, we discuss the
data evaluation of spin-echo data beyond the SE approximation, which limits
these techniques to small energy transfers.

<h3>Band Gap Renormalization at Different Symmetry Points in Perovskites</h3>

<br>
<i>Lijie Wang, Razan Nughays, Jun Yin, Chun-Hua Shih, Tsung-Fang Guo, Omar F. Mohammed, Majed Chergui</i>
<p>Using ultrafast broad-band transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy of
photo-excited MAPbBr3 thin films with probe continua in the visible and the
mid-to-deep-UV ranges, we capture the ultrafast gap renormalization at the
fundamental gap situated at the R symmetry point of the Brillouin Zone (BZ) and
a higher energy gap at the M point. Global Lifetime analysis, Lifetime density
distribution and spectral trace fitting analysis are applied to extract
quantitative information. Our work confirms the similarity of the energy gap
renormalization at both symmetry points, which rises within the instrument
response function (IRF, ~250 fs) and decays in ~400-600 fs times, and an energy
red-shift of ~90-150 meV. The ability to monitor different high symmetry points
in photoexcited perovskites opens exciting prospects into the characterization
of materials, which can be extended to a larger class of materials.

<h3>Phase transitions of LaMnO$_3$ and SrRuO$_3$ from DFT + U based machine  learning force fields simulations</h3>

<i>Thies Jansen, Geert Brocks, Menno Bokdam</i>
<p>Perovskite oxides are known to exhibit many magnetic, electronic and
structural phases as function of doping and temperature. These materials are
theoretically frequently investigated by the DFT+U method, typically in their
ground state structure at $T=0$. We show that by combining machine learning
force fields (MLFFs) and DFT+U based molecular dynamics, it becomes possible to
investigate the crystal structure of complex oxides as function of temperature
and $U$. Here, we apply this method to the magnetic transition metal compounds
LaMnO$_3$ and SrRuO$_3$. We show that the structural phase transition from
orthorhombic to cubic in LaMnO$_3$, which is accompanied by the suppression of
a Jahn-Teller distortion, can be simulated with an appropriate choice of $U$.
For SrRuO$_3$, we show that the sequence of orthorhombic to tetragonal to cubic
crystal phase transitions can be described with great accuracy. We propose that
the $U$ values that correctly capture the temperature-dependent structures of
these complex oxides, can be identified by comparison of the MLFF simulated and
experimentally determined structures.

<h3>Paradigm for finding d-electron heavy fermions: the case of Cr-doped  CsFe$_2$As$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Matteo Crispino, Pablo Villar Arribi, Anmol Shukla, Frédéric Hardy, Amir-Abbas Haghighirad, Thomas Wolf, Rolf Heid, Christoph Meingast, Tommaso Gorni, Adolfo Avella, Luca de' Medici</i>
<p>We define a general strategy for finding new heavy-fermionic materials
without rare-earth elements: doping a Hund metal with pronounced
orbital-selective correlations towards half-filling. We argue that in general
band structures a possible orbital-selective Mott transition is frustrated by
inter-orbital hopping into heavy-fermion behaviour - where d-orbitals provide
both the heavy and the light electrons - which is enhanced when approaching
half-filling. This phase ultimately disappears due to magnetic correlations, as
in a standard Doniach diagram. Experimentally we have further hole doped
CsFe$_2$As$_2$, a Hund metal with 0.5 electrons/Fe away from half-filling, and
obtained a heavy fermionic state with the highest Sommerfeld coefficient for
Fe-pnictides to date (270 mJ/mol K$^2$), before signatures of an
antiferromagnetic phase set in.

<h3>Role of the action function in defining electronic wavefunctions for  large systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06523" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06523</a>
<br>
<i>Peter Fulde</i>
<p>The dimension of the Hilbert space needed for the description of an
interacting electron system increases exponentially with electron number $N$.
As pointed out by W. Kohn this exponential wall problem (EWP) limits the
concept of many-electron wavefunctions based on solutions of Schr\"odinger's
equation to $N \leq N_0$, where $N_0 \approx 10^3$ \cite{Kohn1999}. This
limitation does not hold when the electronic interactions are neglected or
treated in a mean-field approximation. The EWP has directed electronic
structure calculations for solids to methods like density-functional theory
which avoid dealing with many-electron wavefunctions. We show that the highly
unsatisfactory limitation of many-electron wavefunctions to $N \leq N_0$ can be
overcome by generalizing their definition. We show for the ground state of a
large system that it is the logarithm of the solution of Schr\"odinger's
equation which should be used to characterize this system. In this case the
wavefunctions of independent subsystems add up rather than multiply. This
feature is realized by the action function. It provides a simple physical
picture for the resolution of the EWP.

<h3>On the Thermal Transport Puzzles in $α\mbox{-}RuCl_3$</h3>

<i>Zheng-Duo Fan, Xiao-Qi Sun, Jing-Yuan Chen</i>
<p>Thermal transport has been used to probe the nature of
$\alpha\mbox{-}RuCl_3$, an important candidate of Kitaev material. Two
remarkable observations were made under applied magnetic fields at low
temperatures, and have stimulated extensive discussions. One is a sizable
thermal Hall effect, and the other is an apparent ``oscillation'' of the
longitudinal thermal conductivity with the magnetic field. It has been proposed
that the former is due to a bosonic Chern band. Meanwhile, the origin of the
latter has largely remained obscure. This work aims to resolve this
``oscillation'' puzzle. By examining the thermal transport data as well as
other measured properties of $\alpha\mbox{-}RuCl_3$, we argue that the most
plausible scenario is that of phonons scattering with spin degrees of freedom
across multiple phases. We substantiate this picture into a phenomenological
theory, which reproduces the ``oscillation'' behavior in a simple manner and
makes predictions that can be examined by future experiments. Moreover, our
phenomenological theory and the aforementioned proposal for the thermal Hall
effect support each other. We hope this work can thus help settle the physical
mechanism behind the thermal transport puzzles in $\alpha\mbox{-}RuCl_3$.

<h3>Information theory for model reduction in stochastic dynamical systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Matthew S. Schmitt, Maciej Koch-Janusz, Michel Fruchart, Daniel S. Seara, Vincenzo Vitelli</i>
<p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of
the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A
prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these relevant
variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop a
systematic approach based on the information bottleneck to identify the
relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future. We
elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the
eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. Further, we
show that in the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly
determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our information-based
approach indicates when to optimally stop increasing the complexity of the
reduced model. Further, it provides a firm foundation to construct
interpretable deep learning tools that perform model reduction. We illustrate
how these tools work on benchmark dynamical systems and deploy them on
uncurated datasets, such as satellite movies of atmospheric flows downloaded
directly from YouTube.
