<h3>Optimal face-to-face coupling for fast self-folding kirigami</h3>

Kirigami-inspired designs can enable self-folding three-dimensional materials
from flat, two-dimensional sheets. Hierarchical designs of connected levels
increase the diversity of possible target structures, yet they can lead to
longer folding times in the presence of fluctuations. Here, we study the effect
of rotational coupling between levels on the self-folding of two-level kirigami
designs driven by thermal noise in a fluid. Naturally present due to
hydrodynamic resistance, we find that optimization of this coupling as control
parameter can significantly improve a structure's self-folding rate and yield.

Single flagellated bacteria are ubiquitous in nature. They exhibit various
swimming modes using their flagella to explore complex surroundings such as
soil and porous polymer networks. Some single-flagellated bacteria swim with
two distinct modes, one with its flagellum extended away from its body and
another with its flagellum wrapped around it. The wrapped mode has been
observed when the bacteria swim under tight confinements or in highly viscous
polymeric melts. In this study we investigate the hydrodynamics of these two
modes inside a circular pipe. We find that the wrap mode is slower than the
extended mode in bulk but more efficient under strong confinement due to a
hydrodynamic increased of its flagellum translation-rotation coupling.

<h3>Holographic Gubser-Rocha model does not capture all the transport  anomalies of strange metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04433</a>

<br>
<br>
In the last decade, motivated by the concept of Planckian relaxation and the
possible existence of a quantum critical point in cuprate materials,
holographic techniques have been extensively used to tackle the problem of
strange metals and high-Tc superconductors. Among the various setups, the
Gubser-Rocha model has often been celebrated as a successful holographic model
for strange metals since endowed with the famous linear in $T$ resistivity
property. As fiercely advocated by Phil Anderson, beyond $T$-linear
resistivity, there are several additional anomalies unique to the strange metal
phase, as for example a Fermi liquid like Hall angle -- the famous problem of
the two relaxation scales. In this short note, we show that the holographic
Gubser Rocha model fails in this respect and therefore, at least in its
original and simplest form, is not able to capture the transport phenomenology
of strange metals. We prove our statement by means of a direct numerical
computation, a previously demonstrated scaling analysis and also a hydrodynamic
argument. Finally, we conclude with an optimistic discussion on the possible
improvements and generalizations which could lead to a holographic model for
strange metals in all their glory.

<h3>Effects of anisotropy on the high field magnetoresistance of Weyl  semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the effects of anisotropy on the magnetoresistance of Weyl
semimetals (WSMs) in the ultraquantum regime. We utilize the fact that many
Weyl semimetals are approximately axially anisotropic. We find that anisotropy
manifests itself in the strong dependence of the magnetoresistance on the polar
and azimuthal angles determining the orientation of the anisotropy axis with
respect to the applied magnetic field and electric current. We also predict
that the ratio of magnetoresistances in the geometries, where the magnetic
field and anisotropy axes are aligned and where they are orthogonal, scales as
$(v_\bot/v_\parallel)^2$ where $v_\bot$ and $v_\parallel$ are the corresponding
Fermi velocities.

<h3>The topological Kondo model out of equilibrium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03773" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03773</a>
<br>
<i>Matteo M. Wauters, Chia-Min Chung, Lorenzo Maffi, Michele Burrello</i>
<br>
<br>
The topological Kondo effect is a genuine manifestation of the nonlocality of
Majorana modes. We investigate its out-of-equilibrium signatures in a model
with a Cooper-pair box hosting four of these topological modes, each connected
to a metallic lead. Through matrix-product-state techniques, we simulate the
relaxation of the Majorana magnetization, which allows us to determine the
related Kondo temperature. Then, we analyze the onset of electric transport
after a quantum quench of a lead voltage. Our results apply to Majorana
Cooper-pair boxes fabricated in double nanowire devices and provide
non-perturbative evidence of the crossover from weak-coupling states to the
strongly correlated topological Kondo regime. The latter dominates at the
superconductor charge degeneracy points and displays the expected universal
fractional zero-bias conductance.

<h3>Double-$Q$ spin chirality stripes in the anomalous Hall antiferromagnet  CoNb$_3$S$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03776" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03776</a>
<br>
<i>Ben Zager, Raymond Fan, Paul Steadman, Kemp Plumb</i>
<br>
<br>
The metallic antiferromagnet CoNb$_3$S$_6$ exhibits a giant anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) that cannot be explained by a collinear N\'eel order on
intercalated Co ions. Thus, a noncoplanar structure is expected. We carried out
resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS) to reexamine the magnetic structure of
CoNb$_3$S$_6$ and found a double-$Q$ ($2Q$) order with a $(\frac{1}{2}00)$
commensurate component and a long-wavelength modulation. Circular dichroism and
linear polarization analysis reveal that the commensurate components on the two
Co sites are noncollinear and the modulation is helical. The resulting magnetic
structure has a staggered scalar spin chirality forming a stripe pattern in
real space. Furthermore, we found that the helical modulation wavevector
exhibits a sample dependence and develops a low-symmetry domain structure. We
propose that quenched-in lattice strain controls the helical domain structure,
accounting for much of the sample dependence. These results provide insight
into the mechanism of the AHE in CoNb$_3$S$_6$ and identifies potential routes
for controlling the Hall response and realizing other unconventional electronic
phenomena in metallic antiferromagnets.

<h3>Chirality probe of twisted bilayer graphene in the linear transport  regime</h3>

<br>
<i>D. A. Bahamon, G. Gómez-Santos, D. K. Efetov, T. Stauber</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a minimal transport experiment in the linear regime that can probe
the chirality of twisted moir\'e structures. First, we point out that usual
two-terminal conductance measurements cannot access the chirality of a system.
Only with a third contact and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, a
chiral system displays non-reciprocal transport even if all contacts are
symmetric. We thus propose to use the third lead as a voltage probe and show
that opposite enantiomers give rise to different voltage drops on the third
lead. The third lead can also be used as a current probe in the case of
layer-discriminating contacts that can detect different handedness even in the
absence of a magnetic field. Our exact symmetry considerations are supported by
numerical calculations that confirm our conclusions and also demonstrate that
there is a change of chirality around the magic angle.

<h3>Weak-Coupling Theory of Neutron Scattering as a Probe of Altermagnetism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03793" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03793</a>

<br>
<br>
Inelastic neutron scattering provides a powerful probe of the magnetic
excitations of quantum magnets. Altermagnets have recently emerged as a new
class of magnets with vanishing net magnetization characteristic of
antiferromagnets and spin-split electronic structure typical of ferromagnets.
Here we introduce a minimal Hubbard model with two-sublattice orthorhombic
anisotropy as a framework to study altermagnetism. Using unrestricted
Hartree-Fock calculations, we find an altermagnetic state for this model that
evolves from a metallic state to an insulating state with increasing
Hubbard-$U$ Coulomb repulsion. We then examine the inelastic neutron scattering
response in these states using random-phase approximation calculations of the
dynamic spin susceptibility $\chi''({\bf q}, \omega)$. We find that the
magnetic excitation spectrum depends on its chirality for ${\bf q}$ along
certain directions in reciprocal space, an observation that may be used in
inelastic neutron scattering experiments as a probe of altermagnetism.

<h3>Family-Vicsek dynamical scaling and KPZ-like superdiffusive growth of  surface-roughness in a driven one-dimensional quasiperiodic model</h3>

<br>
<i>Sreemayee Aditya, Nilanjan Roy</i>
<br>
<br>
The investigation of the dynamical universality classes of quantum systems is
an important, and rather less explored, aspect of non-equilibrium physics. In
this work, considering the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of spinless fermions in
a one-dimensional quasiperiodic model with and without a periodic driving, we
report the existence of the dynamical one-parameter based Family-Vicsek (FV)
scaling of the "quantum surface-roughness" associated with the particle-number
fluctuations. In absence of periodic driving, the model is interestingly shown
to host a subdiffusive critical phase separated by two subdiffusive critical
lines and a triple point from other phases. An analysis of the fate of critical
phase in the presence of (inter-phase) driving indicates that the critical
phase is quite fragile and has a tendency to get absorbed into the delocalized
or localized regime depending on the driving parameters. Furthermore, periodic
driving can conspire to show quantum Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like
superdiffusive dynamical behavior, which seems to have no classical
counterpart. We further construct an effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which
qualitatively captures this feature occurring in the driven model

Advanced computational methods are being actively sought for addressing the
challenges associated with discovery and development of new combinatorial
material such as formulations. A widely adopted approach involves domain
informed high-throughput screening of individual components that can be
combined into a formulation. This manages to accelerate the discovery of new
compounds for a target application but still leave the process of identifying
the right 'formulation' from the shortlisted chemical space largely a
laboratory experiment-driven process. We report a deep learning model,
Formulation Graph Convolution Network (F-GCN), that can map
structure-composition relationship of the individual components to the property
of liquid formulation as whole. Multiple GCNs are assembled in parallel that
featurize formulation constituents domain-intuitively on the fly. The resulting
molecular descriptors are scaled based on respective constituent's molar
percentage in the formulation, followed by formalizing into a combined
descriptor that represents a complete formulation to an external learning
architecture. The use case of proposed formulation learning model is
demonstrated for battery electrolytes by training and testing it on two
exemplary datasets representing electrolyte formulations vs battery performance
-- one dataset is sourced from literature about Li/Cu half-cells, while the
other is obtained by lab-experiments related to lithium-iodide full-cell
chemistry. The model is shown to predict the performance metrics like Coulombic
Efficiency (CE) and specific capacity of new electrolyte formulations with
lowest reported errors. The best performing F-GCN model uses molecular
descriptors derived from molecular graphs that are informed with HOMO-LUMO and
electric moment properties of the molecules using a knowledge transfer
technique.

<h3>Photodegradation and Thermal Effects in Violet Phosphorus</h3>

Violet phosphorus (VP) has garnered attention for its appealing physical
properties and potential applications in optoelectronics. We present a
comprehensive investigation of the photo degradation and thermal effects of
exfoliated VP on SiO2 substrate. The degradation rate of VP was found to be
strongly influenced by the excitation wavelength and light exposure duration.
Light exposure to above bandgap light (> 532 nm) leads to significantly faster
degradation, attributed to interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generated by the laser. In contrast, lower energy excitation resulted in slower
degradation due to reduced ROS generation. Analysis of photoluminescence (PL)
spectra showed a gradual decline in the exciton population, signifying reduced
lifetime and alterations in formation and stability, ultimately affecting VP's
quantum efficiency. Power-dependent PL measurements at low temperature (4 K)
showed that the intensities of neutral excitons and trions linearly increased
with excitation power, while the energy difference between their peak energies
decreased, indicating changes in the exciton energy gap due to degradation at
higher laser power. At ambient temperature VP exhibited visible neutral exciton
(X0) and trion (T) peaks with higher X0 spectral weight, indicating reduced
thermal stability of T in VP crystals. Temperature dependent Raman showed the
presence of VP up to 673K and back down to room temperature; however, peak
intensities decreased and two new unknown peaks were observed indicating some
level of thermal degradation. Our results provide deeper understanding of VP's
degradation behavior and implications for optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Localization and interaction of interlayer excitons in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$  heterobilayers</h3>

Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers provide a versatile
platform to explore unique excitonic physics via properties of the constituent
TMDs and external stimuli. Interlayer excitons (IXs) can form in TMD
heterobilayers as delocalized or localized states. However, the localization of
IX in different types of potential traps, the emergence of biexcitons in the
high-excitation regime, and the impact of potential traps on biexciton
formation have remained elusive. In our work, we observe two types of potential
traps in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayer, which result in significantly
different emission behavior of IXs at different temperatures. We identify the
origin of these traps as localized defect states and the moir{\'e} potential of
the TMD heterobilayer. Furthermore, with strong excitation intensity, a
superlinear emission behavior indicates the emergence of interlayer biexcitons,
whose formation peaks at a specific temperature. Our work elucidates the
different excitation and temperature regimes required for the formation of both
localized and delocalized IX and biexcitons, and, thus, contributes to a better
understanding and application of the rich exciton physics in TMD
heterostructures.

<h3>DFT Based LDA Study on Tailoring the Optical and Electrical Properties  of SnO and In-Doped SnO</h3>

In this paper, the structural, electronic and optical properties of
tin-monoxide and the impact of Indium (In) doping into tin-monoxide are
computed by Local Density Approximation (LDA) under density function theory
(DFT) framework. The calculated bond length of Sn-O in tin-monoxide is 2.285
angstrom and that deviates greater than 3 percent from the experimental value.
The Sn-O and In-O bond lengths in In-doped tin-monoxide are calculated to be
2.3094 and 2.266 angstrom, respectively. Interestingly, the band gap of pure
tin-monoxide is calculated to be 2.61 eV whereas it is significantly dropped
down to 2.00 eV in the case of In doped tin-monoxide. The Total Density of
State (DOS), Partial DOS and electron density are depicted for tin-monoxide and
In-doped tin-monoxide films. As a consequence of In-doping static value of the
refractive index and real part of the dielectric function for tin-monoxide
decrease from 1.9 to 1.4 and 3.6 to 1.97, respectively. Therefore, In-doping
enhances the properties of the tin-monoxide film, which may lead the material
to be applied in future to develop electronic and opto-electronic devices.

<h3>Physics of band-filling correction in defect calculations of solid-state  materials</h3>

In solid-state physics/chemistry, a precise understanding of defect formation
and its impact on the electronic properties of wide-bandgap insulators is a
cornerstone of modern semiconductor technology. However, complexities arise in
the electronic structure theory of defect formation when the latter triggers
partial occupation of the conduction/valence band, necessitating accurate
post-process correction to the energy calculations. Herein, we dissect these
complexities, focusing specifically on the post-process band-filling
corrections, a crucial element that often demands thorough treatment in defect
formation studies. We recognize the importance of these corrections in
maintaining the accuracy of electronic properties predictions in wide-bandgap
insulators and their role in reinforcing the importance of a reliable common
reference state for defect formation energy calculations. We explored solutions
such as aligning deep states and electrostatic potentials, both of which have
been used in previous works, showing the effect of band alignment on defect
formation energy. Our findings demonstrate that the impact of defect formation
on electronic structure (even deep states) can be significantly dependent on
the supercell size. We also show that within band-filling calculations, one
needs to account for the possible change of electronic structure induced by
defect formation, which requires sufficient convergence of electronic structure
with supercell size. Thus, this work emphasizes the critical steps to predict
defect formation energy better and paves the way for future research to
overcome these challenges and advance the field with more efficient and
reliable predictive models.

<h3>Magnetization plateaus and enhanced magnetocaloric effect of a spin-1/2  Ising-Heisenberg and Heisenberg double sawtooth ladder with four-spin  interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03855</a>

<br>
<br>
The ground state, the entropy and the magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter of the
antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on a double sawtooth ladder
are rigorously investigated using the classical transfer-matrix technique. The
model includes the XXZ interaction between the interstitial Heisenberg dimers,
the Ising coupling between nearest-neighbor spins of the legs and rungs, and
additional cyclic four-spin Ising term in each square plaquette. For a
particular value of the cyclic four-spin exchange we found in the ground-state
phase diagram of the Ising Heisenberg ladder a quadruple point, at which four
different ground states coexist together. During an adiabatic demagnetization
process a fast cooling accompanied with an enhanced magnetocaloric effect can
be detected nearby this quadruple point. The ground-state phase diagram of the
Ising-Heisenberg ladder is confronted with the zero-temperature magnetization
process of the purely quantum Heisenberg ladder, which is calculated by using
exact diagonalization (ED) based on the Lanczos algorithm for a finite-size
ladder of 24 spins and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
simulations for a finite-size ladder with up to 96 spins. Some indications of
existence of intermediate magnetization plateaus in the magnetization process
of the full Heisenberg model for a small but non-zero four-spin Ising coupling
were found. The DMRG results reveal that the quantum Heisenberg double sawtooth
ladder exhibits a quantum Luttinger spin-liquid phase that is absent in the
Ising-Heisenberg counterpart model. Except this difference the magnetic
behavior of the full Heisenberg model is quite analogous to its simplified
Ising-Heisenberg counterpart and hence, one may bring insight into the fully
quantum Heisenberg model from rigorous results for the Ising-Heisenberg model.

<br>
<br>
FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$(FTS) occupies a special spot in modern condensed
matter physics at the intersections of electron correlation, topology, and
unconventional superconductivity. The bulk electronic structure of FTS is
predicted to be topologically nontrivial thanks to the band inversion between
the $d_{xz}$ and $p_z$ bands along $\Gamma$-$Z$. However, there remain debates
in both the authenticity of the Dirac surface states (DSS) and the experimental
deviations of band structure from the theoretical band inversion picture. Here
we resolve these debates through a comprehensive ARPES investigation. We first
observe a persistent DSS independent of $k_z$. Then, by comparing FTS with FeSe
which has no band inversion along $\Gamma$-$Z$, we identify the spectral weight
fingerprint of both the presence of the $p_z$ band and the inversion between
the $d_{xz}$ and $p_z$ bands. Furthermore, we propose a reconciling band
structure under the framework of a tight-binding model preserving crystal
symmetry. Our results highlight the significant influence of correlation on
modifying the band structure and make a strong case for the existence of
topological band structure in this unconventional superconductor.

<h3>Ultrathin films of black phosphorus as suitable platforms for  unambiguous observation of the orbital Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03866</a>

<br>
<br>
Phosphorene, a monolayer of black phosphorus, is a two-dimensional material
that lacks a multivalley structure in the Brillouin zone and has negligible
spin-orbit coupling. This makes it a promising candidate for investigating the
orbital Hall effect independently of the valley or spin Hall effects. To model
phosphorene, we utilized a DFT-derived tight-binding Hamiltonian, which is
constructed with the pseudo atomic orbital projection method. For that purpose,
we use the PAOFLOW code with a newly implemented internal basis that provides a
fairly good description of the phosphorene conduction bands. By employing
linear response theory, we show that phosphorene exhibits a sizable orbital
Hall effect with strong anisotropy in the orbital Hall conductivity for the
out-of-plane orbital angular momentum component. The magnitude and sign of the
conductivity depend upon the in-plane direction of the applied electric field.
These distinctive features enable the observation of the orbital Hall effect in
this material unambiguously. The effects of strain and of a perpendicularly
applied electric field on the phosphorene orbital-Hall response are also
explored. We show that a supplementary electric field applied perpendicular to
the phosphorene layer in its conductive regime gives rise to an induced
in-plane orbital magnetization.

<h3>Why does dissolving salt in water decrease its dielectric permittivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03873</a>
<br>
<i>Chunyi Zhang, Shuwen Yue, Athanassios Z. Panagiotopoulos, Michael L. Klein, Xifan Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
The dielectric permittivity of salt water decreases on dissolving more salt.
For nearly a century, this phenomenon has been explained by invoking saturation
in the dielectric response of the solvent water molecules. Herein, we employ an
advanced deep neural network (DNN), built using data from density functional
theory, to study the dielectric permittivity of sodium chloride solutions.
Notably, the decrease in the dielectric permittivity as a function of
concentration, computed using the DNN approach, agrees well with experiments.
Detailed analysis of the computations reveals that the dominant effect, caused
by the intrusion of ionic hydration shells into the solvent hydrogen-bond
network, is the disruption of dipolar correlations among water molecules.
Accordingly, the observed decrease in the dielectric permittivity is mostly due
to increasing suppression of the collective response of solvent waters.

Moir\'e magnetism featured by stacking engineered atomic registry and lattice
interactions has recently emerged as an appealing quantum state of matter at
the forefront condensed matter physics research. Nanoscale imaging of moir\'e
magnets is highly desirable and serves as a prerequisite to investigate a broad
range of intriguing physics underlying the interplay between topology,
electronic correlations, and unconventional nanomagnetism. Here we report spin
defect-based wide-field imaging of magnetic domains and spin fluctuations in
twisted double trilayer (tDT) chromium triiodide CrI3. We explicitly show that
intrinsic moir\'e domains of opposite magnetizations appear over arrays of
moir\'e supercells in low-twist-angle tDT CrI3. In contrast, spin fluctuations
measured in tDT CrI3 manifest little spatial variations on the same mesoscopic
length scale due to the dominant driving force of intralayer exchange
interaction. Our results enrich the current understanding of exotic magnetic
phases sustained by moir\'e magnetism and highlight the opportunities provided
by quantum spin sensors in probing microscopic spin related phenomena on
two-dimensional flatland.

Prussian blue was the world's first synthetic dye. Its structural, optical
and magnetic properties have led to many applications in technology and
medicine, and provide paradigms for understanding coordination polymers,
framework materials and mixed-valence compounds. The intense red absorption of
Prussian blue that characterises chemical and physical properties critical to
many of these applications is now shown to arise from localised intervalence
charge transfer transitions within two chromophoric variants (ligand isomers)
of an idealised "dimer" fragment {(NC)5FeII}(mu-CN){FeIII(NC)3(H2O)2}. This

to facilitate visible absorption. Essential to the analysis is the
demonstration, obtained independently using absorption and magnetic circular
dichroism spectroscopies, that spectra of Prussian blues are strongly
influenced by particle size and (subsequent) light scattering. These
interpretations are guided and supported by density functional theory

Motivated by the recent experimental study on hydrogen storage in MXene
multilayers [Nature Nanotechnol. 2021, 16, 331], for the first time we propose
a workflow to computationally screen 23,857 compounds of MXene to explore the
general relation between the activated H2 bond length and adsorption distance.
By using density functional theory (DFT), we generate a dataset to investigate
the adsorption geometries of hydrogen on MXenes, based on which we train
physics-informed atomistic line graph neural networks (ALIGNNs) to predict
adsorption parameters. To fit the results, we further derived a formula that
quantitatively reproduces the dependence of H2 bond length on the adsorption
distance from MXenes within the framework of Pauling's resonating valence bond
(RVB) theory, revealing the impact of transition metal's ligancy and valence on
activating dihydrogen in H2 storage.

Recently, the giant intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has been observed
in the materials with kagome lattice. In this study, we systematically
investigate the influence of high pressure on the AHE in the ferromagnet
LiMn6Sn6 with clean Mn kagome lattice. Our in-situ high-pressure Raman
spectroscopy indicates that the crystal structure of LiMn6Sn6 maintains a
hexagonal phase under high pressures up to 8.51 GPa. The anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC) {\sigma}xyA remains around 150 {\Omega}-1 cm-1, dominated by
the intrinsic mechanism. Combined with theoretical calculations, our results
indicate that the stable AHE under pressure in LiMn6Sn6 originates from the
robust electronic and magnetic structure.

Optimizing density-functional theory (DFT) and G0W0 calculations present
coupled problems as orbitals from DFT are needed as G0W0 starting points.
Applied to 341 two-dimensional (2D) materials, we demonstrate that CAM-B3LYP
provides minimal changes in bandgap (e.g., mean absolute deviation of 0.23 eV)
when used to start G0W0 calculations, compared to traditional functionals such
as PBE, PBE0, and HSE06 (1.07 eV, 1.48 eV, and 1.51 eV, respectively).
CAM-B3LYP also delivers the smallest changes in orbital representation. These
and other results indicate the suitability of CAM-B3LYP as a density-functional
approach for modelling 2D materials, as well as for use in optimizing G0W0
calculations. Our findings parallel well established features of applications

<h3>Superconducting Gap Structure of Filled Skutterudite LaOs$_4$As$_{12}$  Compound through $μ$SR Investigations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Filled skutterudite compounds have gained attention recently as an innovative
platforms for studying intriguing low-temperature superconducting properties.
Regarding the symmetry of the superconducting gap, contradicting findings from
several experiments have been made for LaRu$_{4}$As$_{12}$ and its
isoelectronic counterpart, LaOs$_{4}$As$_{12}$. In this vein, we report
comprehensive bulk and microscopic results on LaOs$_{4}$As$_{12}$ utilizing
specific heat analysis and muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR)
measurements. Bulk superconductivity with $T_C$ = 3.2 K was confirmed by heat
capacity. The superconducting ground state of the filled-skutterudite
LaOs$_{4}$As$_{12}$ compound is found to have two key characteristics:
superfluid density exhibits saturation type behavior at low temperature, which
points to a fully gapped superconductivity with gap value of $2\Delta/k_BT_C$ =
3.26; additionally, the superconducting state does not show any sign of
spontaneous magnetic field, supporting the preservation of time-reversal
symmetry. These results open the door for the development of La-based
skutterudites as special probes for examining the interplay of single- and
multiband superconductivity in classical electron-phonon systems.

<br>
<br>
In the framework of statistical mechanics the properties of macroscopic
systems are deduced starting from the laws of their microscopic dynamics. One
of the key assumptions in this procedure is the ergodic property, namely the
equivalence between time averages and ensemble averages. This property can be
proved only for a limited number of systems; however, as proved by Khinchin
[1], weak forms of it hold even in systems that are not ergodic at the
microscopic scale, provided that extensive observables are considered. Here we
show in a pedagogical way the validity of the ergodic hypothesis, at a
practical level, in the paradigmatic case of a chain of harmonic oscillators.
By using analytical results and numerical computations, we provide evidence
that this non-chaotic integrable system shows ergodic behavior in the limit of
many degrees of freedom. In particular, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
turns out to fairly describe the statistics of the single particle velocity. A
study of the typical time-scales for relaxation is also provided.

This is the user manual for the hybrid code XTANT-3, simulating intense

simulation of nonequilibrium, nonadiabatic, and nonthermal effects in
electronically excited matter, and the synergy and interplay of these effects.
This text contains a description of the theoretical basis of the model and the

<h3>Magnon influence on the superconducting DOS in FI/S bilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Heterostuctures superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (FI/S) are paradigmic
systems for studying mutual influence of superconductivity and magnetism via
proximity effects. In particular, spin-split superconductivity is realized in
such structures. Recent experiments and theories demonstrate a rich variety of
transport phenomena occurring in devices based on such heterostructures that
suggest direct applications in thermoelectricity, low-dissipative spintronics,
radiation detection and sensing. In this work we investigate the influence of
the electron-magnon interaction at the superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator
interface on the spin-split superconductivity. It is predicted that due to the
magnon-mediated electron spin-flip processes the spin-split quasiparticle
branches are partially mixed and reconstructed, and the BCS-like spin-split
shape of the superconducting DOS, which is typical for superconductors in the
effective exchange field, is strongly modified. An odd-frequency
superconducting order parameter admixture to the leading singlet order
parameter is also found. These findings expand the physical picture of
spin-split superconductivity beyond the mean-field description of the
ferromagnet exchange field.

<h3>Short-time large deviations of the spatially averaged height of a KPZ  interface on a ring</h3>

<br>
<i>Timo Schorlepp, Pavel Sasorov, Baruch Meerson</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the optimal fluctuation method, we evaluate the short-time probability
distribution $P (\bar{H}, L, t=T)$ of the spatially averaged height $\bar{H} =
(1/L) \int_0^L h(x, t=T) \, dx$ of a one-dimensional interface $h(x, t)$
governed by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation $$ \partial_th=\nu
\partial_x^2h+\frac{\lambda}{2} \left(\partial_xh\right)^2+\sqrt{D}\xi(x,t) $$
on a ring of length $L$. The process starts from a flat interface,
$h(x,t=0)=0$. Both at $\lambda \bar{H} < 0$, and at sufficiently small positive
$\lambda \bar{H}$ the optimal (that is, the least-action) path $h(x,t)$ of the
interface, conditioned on $\bar{H}$, is uniform in space, and the distribution
$P (\bar{H}, L, T)$ is Gaussian. However, at sufficiently large $\lambda
\bar{H} > 0$ the spatially uniform solution becomes sub-optimal and gives way
to non-uniform optimal paths. We study them, and the resulting non-Gaussian
distribution $P (\bar{H}, L, T)$, analytically and numerically. The loss of
optimality of the uniform solution occurs via a dynamical phase transition of
either first, or second order, depending on the rescaled system size $\ell =
L/\sqrt{\nu T}$, at a critical value $\bar{H}=\bar{H}_{\text{c}}(\ell)$. At
large but finite $\ell$ the transition is of first order. Remarkably, it
becomes an "accidental" second-order transition in the limit of $\ell \to
\infty$, where a large-deviation behavior $-\ln P (\bar{H}, L, T) \simeq (L/T)
f(\bar{H})$ (in the units $\lambda=\nu=D=1$) is observed. At small $\ell$ the
transition is of second order, while at $\ell =O(1)$ transitions of both types
occur.

<h3>Transport properties in gapped graphene through magnetic barrier in a  laser field</h3>

We study the transport properties of Dirac fermions through gapped graphene
through a magnetic barrier irradiated by a laser field oscillating in time. We
use Floquet theory and the solution of Weber's differential equation to
determine the energy spectrum corresponding to the three regions composing the
system. The boundary conditions and the transfer matrix approach {are} employed
to explicitly determine the transmission probabilities for multi-energy bands
and the associated conductance. As an illustration, we focus only on the three
first bands: the central band $T_0$ (zero photon exchange) and the two first
side bands $T_{\pm1}$ (photon emission or absorption). It is found that the
laser field activates the process of translation through photon exchange.
Furthermore, we show that varying the incident angle and energy gap strongly
affects the transmission process. The conductance increases when the number of
electrons that cross the barrier increases, namely when there is a significant
transmission.

<h3>Towards reducing tension-compression yield and cyclic asymmetry in pure  magnesium and magnesium-aluminum alloy with cerium addition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04051</a>

<br>
<br>
In this study, we report the effect of cerium (Ce) addition on the
tension-compression yield and cyclic asymmetry in commercially pure magnesium
(Cp-Mg) and Mg-Al alloy at room temperature (RT). The materials examined
include extruded and annealed Cp-Mg, Mg-0.5Ce, and Mg-3Al-0.5Ce alloys.
Incorporation of 0.5wt.% Ce in pure Mg results in the weakening of its basal
texture, uniform distribution of Mg12Ce precipitates, and refinement of the
grain size. Consequently, the tensile yield strength and ductility of pure Mg
increase, and tension-compression yield asymmetry is eliminated. However, the
presence of 3wt.% Al in Mg suppresses the beneficial effects of Ce addition.
The formation of complex precipitates, such as Mg-Al-Ce and Al11Ce3, limits the
weakening of the basal texture, reduction in grain size, improvement in
ductility, and elimination of tension-compression yield asymmetry observed in
Mg-0.5Ce. Nevertheless, Al contributes to the solid solution strengthening in
Mg, resulting in the highest tensile yield strength of Mg-3Al-0.5Ce. Finally,
the addition of 0.5wt.% Ce enhances the cyclic strength, stabilizes cyclic
stress response, reduces inelastic strain, and minimizes cyclic asymmetry in
both pure Mg and Mg-Al alloy while maintaining a comparable fatigue life.
Overall, Ce addition positively impacts the microstructure and mechanical
behavior of pure Mg and its investigated alloy. The reasons for these
improvements are discussed in detail.

<h3>Neutron scattering and muon-spin spectroscopy studies of the magnetic  triangular-lattice compounds $A_2$La$_2$NiW$_2$O$_{12}$ ($A$ = Sr, Ba)</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on the geometrically frustrated two-dimensional triangular-lattice
magnets $A_2$La$_2$NiW$_2$O$_{12}$ ($A$ = Sr, Ba) studied mostly by means of
neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and muon-spin rotation and relaxation
($\mu$SR) techniques. The chemical pressure induced by the Ba-for-Sr
substitution suppresses the ferromagnetic (FM) transition from 6.3 K in the
Ba-compound to 4.8 K in the Sr-compound. We find that the $R\bar{3}$ space
group reproduces the NPD patterns better than the previously reported
$R\bar{3}m$ space group. Both compounds adopt the same magnetic structure with
a propagation vector $\boldsymbol{k} = (0, 0, 0)$, in which the Ni$^{2+}$
magnetic moments are aligned ferromagnetically along the $c$-axis. The
zero-field {\textmu}SR results reveal two distinct internal fields (0.31 and
0.10 T), caused by the long-range ferromagnetic order. The small transverse
muon-spin relaxation rates reflect the homogeneous internal field distribution
in the ordered phase and, thus, further support the simple FM arrangement of
the Ni$^{2+}$ moments. The small longitudinal muon-spin relaxation rates, in
both the ferromagnetic- and paramagnetic states of A$_2$La$_2$NiW$_2$O$_{12}$,
indicate that spin fluctuations are rather weak. Our results demonstrate that
chemical pressure indeed changes the superexchange interactions in
$A_2$La$_2$NiW$_2$O$_{12}$ compounds, with the FM interactions being dominant.

Standard power series are used to construct and analyze angular and radial

for Helmholtz equation in a spheroid. With an advanced approach the low-lying
energy levels of a deep spheroidal quantum well are calculated as a function of

We examine the high-frequency optical mode of {\alpha}-Fe2O3 and report that
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction generates a new type of torque on the
magnetic resonance. Using a continuous-wave terahertz interferometer, we
measure the optical mode spectra, where the asymmetric absorption with a large
amplitude and broad linewidth is observed near the magnetic transition point,
Morin temperature (TM ~ 254.3 K). Based on the spin wave model, the spectral
anomaly is attributed to the DM interaction-induced torque, enabling to extract
the strength of DM interaction field of 4 T. Our work opens a new avenue to
characterize the spin resonance behaviors at an antiferromagnetic singular
point for next-generation and high-frequency spin-based information
technologies.

Plastic pollution in the aquatic environment has been assessed for many years
by ocean waste collection expeditions around the globe or by river sampling.
While the total amount of plastic produced worldwide is well documented, the
amount of plastic found in the ocean, the distribution of particles on its
surface and its evolution over time are still the subject of much debate. In
this article, we propose a general fragmentation model, postulating the
existence of a critical size below which particle fragmentation becomes
extremely unlikely. In the frame of this model, an abundance peak appears for
sizes around 1mm, in agreement with real environmental data. Using, in
addition, a realistic exponential waste feed to the ocean, we discuss the
relative impact of fragmentation and feed rates, and the temporal evolution of
microplastics (MP) distribution. New conclusions on the temporal trend of MP
pollution are drawn.

<br>
<br>
Strongly correlated states are commonly emerged in twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) with magic-angle, where the electron-electron (e-e) interaction U becomes
prominent relative to the small bandwidth W of the nearly flat band. However,
the stringent requirement of this magic angle makes the sample preparation and
the further application facing great challenges. Here, using scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS), we demonstrate that the
correlation-induced symmetry-broken states can also be achieved in a 3.45{\deg}
TBG, via engineering this non-magic-angle TBG into regimes of U/W > 1. We
enhance the e-e interaction through controlling the microscopic dielectric
environment by using a MoS2 substrate. Simultaneously, the bandwidth of the
low-energy van Hove singularity (VHS) peak is reduced by enhancing the
interlayer coupling via STM tip modulation. When partially filled, the VHS peak
exhibits a giant splitting into two states flanked the Fermi level and shows a
symmetry-broken LDOS distribution with a stripy charge order, which confirms
the existence of strong correlation effect in our 3.45{\deg} TBG. Our result
paves the way for the study and application of the correlation physics in TBGs
with a wider range of twist angle.

<br>
<i>Marco Campetella, Giovanni Marini, Jianqiang Sky Zhou, Matteo Calandra</i>
<br>
<br>
The compound CuTe (vulcanite) undergoes a quasi one dimensional charge
density wave (CDW) at $T< T_{\mathrm{CDW}}=335$ K with a $5\times1\times2$
periodicity. The mechanism at its origin is debated. Several theoretical works
claimed that semilocal functionals are unable to describe its occurrence and
ascribed its formation only to strong electron-electron interaction. Moreover,
the possible role of quantum anharmonicity has not been addressed. Here, by
performing quantum anharmonic calculations, we show that semilocal functionals
correctly describe the occurrence of a CDW in CuTe if ultradense electron
momentum grids allowing for small electronic temperatures are used. The
distortion is driven by the perfect nesting among 1D Fermi surface sheets
extending in the $k_y$ direction. Quantum anharmonic effects are important and
tend to suppress both the distortion and $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$. The quantum
anharmonic structural minimization of the CDW phase in the generalized gradient
approximation leads, however, to distorted Te-Te bond lengths in the low
temperature phase that are $21\%$ of the experimental ones at $T=20$ K. This
suggests that, even if the electron-electron interaction is not crucial for the
mechanism of CDW formation, it is relevant to accurately describe the
structural data for the low-T phase. We assess the effect of correlation on the
CDW by using the DFT+U+V approximation with parameters calculated from first
principles. We find that correlation enhances the Te-Te distortion, T$_{CDW}$
and the total energy gain by the distortion.

<h3>Investigating Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions in  Kagome spin ice by quantifying Monte Carlo process: Distribution of Hamming  distances</h3>

<br>
<br>
We reinvestigate the phase transitions of the Ising model on the Kagome
lattice with antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and ferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which has a six-state-clock spin ice ground
state and two consecutive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase
transitions. Employing the classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the phases
are characterized by the magnetic order parameter, and the critical
temperatures are obtained by the finite-size scaling of related physical
quantities. Moreover, we attempt to gain general information on the phase
transitions from the MC process instead of MC results and successfully extract
the correct transition points with surprisingly high accuracy. Specifically, we
focus on the selected data set of uncorrelated MC configurations and quantify
the MC process using the distribution of two-configuration Hamming distances in
this small data collection. This distribution is more than a quantity that
features different behaviors in different phases but also nicely supports the
same BKT scaling form as the order parameter, from which we successfully
determine the two BKT transition points with surprisingly high accuracy. We
also discuss the connection between the phase transitions and the intrinsic
dimension extracted from the Hamming distances, which is widely used in the
growing field of machine learning and is reported to be able to detect critical
points. Our findings provide a new understanding of the spin ice transitions in
the Kagome lattice and can hopefully be used similarly to identify transitions
in the quantum system on the same lattice with strong frustrations.

<h3>Cluster tomography in percolation</h3>

<i>Helen S. Ansell, Samuel J. Frank, István A. Kovács</i>
<br>
<br>
In cluster tomography, we propose measuring the number of clusters $N$
intersected by a line segment of length $\ell$ across a finite sample. As
expected, the leading order of $N(\ell)$ scales as $a\ell$, where $a$ depends
on microscopic details of the system. However, at criticality, there is often
an additional nonlinearity of the form $b\ln(\ell)$, originating from the
endpoints of the line segment. By performing large scale Monte Carlo
simulations of both 2$d$ and 3$d$ percolation, we find that $b$ is universal
and depends only on the angles encountered at the endpoints of the line segment
intersecting the sample. Our findings are further supported by analytic
arguments in 2$d$, building on results in conformal field theory. Being broadly
applicable, cluster tomography can be an efficient tool to detect phase
transitions and to characterize the corresponding universality class in
classical or quantum systems with a relevant cluster structure.

We investigate the effective Lande factor in semiconductor nanowires with
strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using the $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory
and the envelope function approach we derive a conduction band Hamiltonian
where the tensor $g^*$ is explicitly related to the spin-orbit coupling
constant $\alpha_R$. Our model includes orbital effects from the Rashba
spin-orbit term, leading to a significant enhancement of the effective Lande
factor which is naturally anisotropic. For nanowires based on the low-gap, high
spin-orbit coupled material InSb, we investigate the anisotropy of the
effective Lande factor with respect to the magnetic field direction, exposing a
twofold symmetry for the bottom gate architecture. The anisotropy results from
the competition between the localization of the envelope function and the spin
polarization of the electronic state, both determined by the magnetic field
direction.

We present theoretical calculations of the optical spectrum of monolayer
MoS$_2$ with a charged defect. In particular, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter
equation based on an atomistic tight-binding model of the MoS$_2$ electronic
structure which allows calculations for large supercells. The defect is
modelled as a point charge whose potential is screened by the MoS$_2$
electrons. We find that the defect gives rise to new peaks in the optical
spectrum approximately 100-200 meV below the first free exciton peak. These
peaks arise from transitions involving in-gap bound states induced by the
charged defect. Our findings are in good agreement with experimental
measurements.

high chance of coexistence of 1H-1T prime heterostructures which poses great
complexity in the measurement of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivities
(kappa). In this work, via first-principles calculations, we examine the
lattice-wave propagation and thermal conduction in this highly structurally
anisotropic 1T prime MoTe2. Our calculation shows that the 1T prime phase has a
sound velocity of 2.13 km/s (longitudinal acoustic wave), much lower than that
of the 1H phase (4.05 km /s), indicating a staggered transmission of lattice
waves across the boundary from 1H to 1T prime phase. Interestingly, the highly
anisotropic 1T prime MoTe2 shows nearly isotropic and limited kappa_L of 13.02
W/mK, owing to a large Gruneisen parameter of acoustic flexural mode, heavy
masses of Mo and Te elements and a low phonon group velocity. Accumulative
kappa_L as a function of mean free path (MFP) indicates phonons with MFP less
than ~300 nm contribute 80% of kappa_L and an inflection point at ~600 nm. Our
results will be critical for understanding of the size dependent kappa_L of
nanostructured 1T prime MoTe2.

Empowering the creation of thermodynamic and property databases, the CALPHAD
(CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) methodology plays a vital role in enhancing
materials and manufacturing process design. In this study, we propose a deep
learning approach to train parameters in CALPHAD models solely based on
chemical formula. We demonstrate its application through an example of
calculating the mixing parameter of liquids. This work showcases the
integration of CALPHAD and deep learning, highlighting its potential for

<h3>Weyl semimetallic state in the Rashba-Hubbard model</h3>

We investigate the Hubbard model with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling on a
square lattice. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling generates two-dimensional Weyl
points in the band dispersion. In a system with edges along [11] direction,
zero-energy edge states appear, while no edge state exists for a system with
edges along an axis direction. The zero-energy edge states with a certain
momentum along the edges are predominantly in the up-spin state on the right
edge, while they are predominantly in the down-spin state on the left edge.
Thus, the zero-energy edge states are helical. By using a variational Monte
Carlo method for finite Coulomb interaction cases, we find that the Weyl points
can move toward the Fermi level by the correlation effects. We also investigate
the magnetism of the model by the Hartree-Fock approximation and discuss weak
magnetic order in the weak-coupling region.

Three-dimensional higher-order topological semimetals in crystalline systems
exhibit higher-order Fermi arcs on one-dimensional hinges, challenging the
conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. However, the existence of
higher-order Fermi arc states in aperiodic quasicrystalline systems remains
uncertain. In this work, we present the emergence of three-dimensional
quasicrystalline second-order topological semimetal phases by vertically
stacking two-dimensional quasicrystalline second-order topological insulators.
These quasicrystalline topological semimetal phases are protected by rotational
symmetries forbidden in crystals, and are characterized by topological hinge
Fermi arcs connecting fourfold degenerate Dirac-like points in the spectrum.
Our findings reveal an intriguing class of higher-order topological phases in
quasicrystalline systems, shedding light on their unique properties.

The generation of plausible crystal structures is often an important step in
the computational prediction of crystal structures from composition. Here, we
introduce a methodology for crystal structure generation involving
autoregressive large language modeling of the Crystallographic Information File
(CIF) format. Our model, CrystaLLM, is trained on a comprehensive dataset of
millions of CIF files, and is capable of reliably generating correct CIF syntax
and plausible crystal structures for many classes of inorganic compounds.
Moreover, we provide general and open access to the model by deploying it as a
web application, available to anyone over the internet. Our results indicate
that the model promises to be a reliable and efficient tool for both
crystallography and materials informatics.

<br>

We consider a generic four-stroke quantum Otto engine consisting of two
unitary and two thermalization strokes with an arbitrary many-body working
medium. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism,
we provide an analytical expression for the cumulant generating function
corresponding to the joint probability distribution of non-equilibrium work and
heat. The obtained result is valid up to the second order of the external
driving amplitude. We then focus on the linear response limit and obtain
Onsager's transport coefficients for the generic Otto cycle and showed that the
traditional fluctuation-dissipation relation for the total work is violated in
the quantum domain, whereas for heat it is preserved. This leads to remarkable
consequences in obtaining universal constraints on heat and work fluctuations
for engine and refrigerator regimes of the Otto cycle and further allows us to
make connections to the thermodynamic uncertainty relations. These findings are
illustrated using a paradigmatic model that can be feasibly implemented in
experiments.

<h3>MD-HIT: Machine learning for materials property prediction with dataset  redundancy control</h3>

<br>

Materials datasets are usually featured by the existence of many redundant
(highly similar) materials due to the tinkering material design practice over
the history of materials research. For example, the materials project database
has many perovskite cubic structure materials similar to SrTiO$_3$. This sample
redundancy within the dataset makes the random splitting of machine learning
model evaluation to fail so that the ML models tend to achieve over-estimated
predictive performance which is misleading for the materials science community.
This issue is well known in the field of bioinformatics for protein function
prediction, in which a redundancy reduction procedure (CD-Hit) is always
applied to reduce the sample redundancy by ensuring no pair of samples has a
sequence similarity greater than a given threshold. This paper surveys the
overestimated ML performance in the literature for both composition based and
structure based material property prediction. We then propose a material
dataset redundancy reduction algorithm called MD-HIT and evaluate it with
several composition and structure based distance threshold sfor reducing data
set sample redundancy. We show that with this control, the predicted
performance tends to better reflect their true prediction capability. Our
MD-hit code can be freely accessed at https://github.com/usccolumbia/MD-HIT

<h3>Phase Diagram and Crossover Phases of Topologically Ordered Graphene  Zigzag Nanoribbons: Role of Localization Effects</h3>

<i>Hoang Anh Le, In Hwan Lee, Young Heon Kim, S.-R. Eric Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We computed the phase diagram of the zigzag graphene nanoribbons as a
function of on-site repulsion, doping, and disorder strength. The topologically
ordered phase undergoes topological phase transitions into crossover phases,
which are new disordered phases with a nonuniversal topological entanglement
entropy with significant variance. The topological order is destroyed by
competition between localization effects and on-site repulsion. We found that
strong on-site repulsion and/or doping weakens the nonlocal correlations
between the opposite zigzag edges. In one of the crossover phases, both
$\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges and spin-charge separation were absent;
however, charge-transfer correlations between the zigzag edges were possible.
Another crossover phase contains $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges, but no
charge transfer correlations. In low-doped zigzag ribbons the interplay between
electron localization and on-site repulsion contributes to the spatial
separation of quasi-degenerate gap-edge states and protects the charge
fractionalization against quantum fluctuations. In all these effects, mixed
chiral gap-edge states play an important role. The properties of nontopological
strongly disordered and strongly repulsive phases are also observed. Each phase
of the phase diagram has a different zigzag-edge structure.

Based on C8, carbon 4C, with cfc topology, two hybrid carbon allotropes
generated by inserting C(sp2) and C(sp1) carbon atoms into C8 diamond-like
lattice were identified and labeled ene-C10 containing C(sp2) and ene-yne-C14
containing C(sp2 and sp1). The introduced double and triple chemical
descriptions were illustrated from the projected charge densities. The crystal
density and the cohesive energy were found to decrease due to the enhanced
openness of the structures from inserted sp2/sp1 carbons, with a resulting
decrease of the hardness along the series C8, C10, C12, and C14. The novel
hybrid allotropes were found stable mechanically (elastic constants and their
combinations) and dynamically (phonons band structures). The thermal properties
from the temperature dependence of the heat capacity CV were found to
increasingly depart from diamond-like C8 to higher values. From the electronic
band structures, the inserted carbons were found to add up bands rigidly to
diamond-like C8 while being characterized by metallic-like behavior for ene-C10
and ene-yne-C14.

Polymer chains dissolved in a solvent take random conformations due to large
internal degrees of freedom and are characterized geometrically by their
average shape and size. The diffusive dynamics of such large macromolecules
play an indispensable role in a plethora of engineering applications. The
influence of the size of the polymer chain on its diffusion is well studied,
whereas the same cannot be said for the shape of the polymer chain. In the
present work, the influence of shape on the center-of-mass diffusion of the
star-shaped chains in solution is investigated using Multi-particle Collision
Dynamics. Star-shaped chains of varying degrees of functionality are modeled in
a good solvent at infinite dilution. The radius of gyration($R_g$) of the
star-shaped chains follows a functionality-independent scaling law with the
chain length($N$), $R_g \sim N^{\nu}$, where $\nu \sim 0.627$. The shape of the
polymer chains is calibrated by relative shape anisotropy. Highly anisotropic
star-shaped polymer chains are found to have a faster rate of diffusion along
the translational direction due to a slower rate of rotational diffusion when
the radius of gyration of the polymer chains is maintained constant.

Quantum technologies like single photon emitters and qubits can be enabled by
point defects in semiconductors, with the NV-center in diamond being the most
prominent example. There are many different semiconductors, each potentially
hosting interesting defects. High-throughput methods and automated workflows
become necessary when searching for novel point defects in a large chemical
space. The symmetry properties of the point defect orbitals can yield useful
information about the behavior of the system, such as the interaction with
polarized light. We have developed an automated code to perform symmetry
analysis of point defect orbitals obtained by plane-wave density functional
theory simulations. The code, named ADAQ-SYM, calculates the characters for
each orbital, finds the irreducible representations, and uses selection rules
to find which optical transitions are allowed. The capabilities of ADAQ-SYM are
demonstrated on several defects in diamond and 4H-SiC. The symmetry analysis
explains the different zero phonon line (ZPL) polarization of the hk and kh
divacancies in 4H-SiC. ADAQ-SYM is automated, making it suitable for
high-throughput screening of point defects.

Spin-orbit coupling and breaking of inversion symmetry are necessary
ingredients to enable a pure spin current-based manipulation of the
magnetization via the spin-orbit torque effect. Currently, magnetic insulator
oxides with non-dissipative characteristics are being explored. When combined
with non-magnetic heavy metals, known for their large spin-orbit coupling, they
offer promising potential for energy-efficient spin-orbitronics applications.
The intrinsic electronic correlations characterizing those strongly correlated
oxides hold the promises to add extra control-knobs to the desired efficient
spin-wave propagation and abrupt magnetization switching phenomena. Spinel
vanadate FeV2O4 (FVO) exhibits several structural phase transitions which are
accompanied by an intricate interplay of magnetic, charge and orbital
orderings. When grown as a thin film onto SrTiO3, the compressive strain state
induces a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, making FVO-based heterostructures
desirable for spin-orbitronics applications. In this study, we have optimised
the deposition of stoichiometric and epitaxial Pt/FVO heterostructures by
Pulsed Laser Deposition and examined their spin-related phenomena. From
angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements, we observed both Anisotropic
Magnetoresistance (AMR) and Spin Hall Magnetoresistance (SMR) effects. Our
findings show the SMR component as the primary contributor to the overall
magnetoresistance, whose high value of 0.12% is only comparable to properly
optimized oxide-based systems.

<br>
<br>
In this report, we investigate the effect of low coefficient of thermal
expansion (CTE) metals on the operating speed of hafnium-based oxide
capacitance. We found that the cooling process of low CTE metals during rapid
thermal annealing (RTA) generates in-plane tensile stresses in the film, This
facilitates an increase in the volume fraction of the o-phase and significantly
improves the domain switching speed. However, no significant benefit was
observed at electric fields less than 1 MV/cm. This is because at low voltage
operation, the defective resistance (dead layer) within the interface prevents
electron migration and the increased RC delay. Minimizing interface defects
will be an important key to extending endurance and retention.

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds are a powerful tool for accurate
magnetic field measurements. The key is precisely estimating the
field-dependent splitting width of the optically detected magnetic resonance
(ODMR) spectra of the NV centers. In this study, we investigate the optical
power dependence of the ODMR spectra using NV ensemble in nanodiamonds (NDs)
and a single-crystal bulk diamond. We find that the splitting width
exponentially decays and is saturated as the optical power increases.
Comparison between NDs and a bulk sample shows that while the decay amplitude
is sample-dependent, the optical power at which the decay saturates is almost
sample-independent. We propose that this unexpected phenomenon is an intrinsic
property of the NV center due to non-axisymmetry deformation or impurities. Our
finding indicates that diamonds with less deformation are advantageous for
accurate magnetic field measurements.

The presence of long-lived oscillations in the expectation values of local
observables after quantum quenches has recently attracted considerable
attention in relation to weak ergodicity breaking. Here we focus on an
alternative mechanism that gives rise to such oscillations in a class of
systems that support kinematically protected gapped excitations at zero
temperature. An open question in this context is whether such oscillations will
ultimately decay. We resolve this issue by considering spin models that can be
mapped to systems of weakly interacting fermions, which in turn are amenable to
an analysis by standard methods based on the BBGKY hierarchy. We find that
there is a parametrically large time scale after which the oscillations start
to decay.

Polarons, which arise from the self-trapping interaction between electrons
and lattice distortions in a solid, have been known and extensively
investigated for nearly a century. Nevertheless, the study of polarons
continues to be an active and evolving field, with ongoing advancements in both
fundamental understanding and practical applications. Here, we present a
microscopic model that exhibits a diverse range of dynamic behavior, arising
from the intricate interplay between two excitation-phonon coupling terms. The
derivation of the model is based on an experimentally feasible Rydberg-dressed
system with dipole-dipole interactions, making it a promising candidate for
realization in a Rydberg atoms quantum simulator. Remarkably, our analysis
reveals a growing asymmetry in Bloch oscillations, leading to a macroscopic
transport of non-spreading excitations under a constant force. Moreover, we
compare the behavior of excitations, when coupled to either acoustic or optical
phonons, and demonstrate the robustness of our findings against on-site random
potential. Overall, this work contributes to the understanding of polaron
dynamics with their potential applications in coherent quantum transport and
offers valuable insights for research on Rydberg-based quantum systems.

A methodical inquiry of the outcome of oxygen plasma exposure in low
bandwidth compounds belonging to the perovskite family Pr1-xSrxMnO3 manganites
where x = 0.5, has been presented in this communication by comparing the
structural and transport properties of the untreated and plasma treated
samples. It is witnessed that the high-temperature transmission is carried out
by small polarons while the low-temperature transmission is attributed to
variable range polarons. The changes in the transport properties may be
attributed to the structural modification due to plasma exposure as revealed by
the Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diffraction pattern. Further, oxygen plasma
exposure boosts the conductivity due to the integration of oxygen ions in the
plasma-exposed samples, thereby rendering them oxygen-rich.

The identification of distinct charge transport features, deriving from
nontrivial bulk band and surface states, has been a challenging subject in the
field of topological systems. In topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals,
nontrivial conical bands with Fermi-arc surfaces states give rise to negative
longitudinal magnetoresistance due to chiral anomaly effect and unusual
thickness dependent quantum oscillation from Weyl-orbit effect, which were
demonstrated recently in experiments. In this work, we report the experimental
observations of large nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport effects for both
longitudinal and transverse channels in an untwinned Weyl metal of SrRuO$_3$
thin film grown on a SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate. From rigorous measurements with
bias current applied along various directions with respect to the crystalline
principal axes, the magnitude of nonlinear Hall signals from the transverse
channel exhibits a simple sin$\alpha$ dependent at low temperatures, where
$\alpha$ is the angle between bias current direction and orthorhombic
[001]$_{\rm o}$, reaching a maximum when current is along orthorhombic
[1-10]$_{\rm o}$. On the contrary, the magnitude of nonlinear and nonreciprocal
signals in the longitudinal channel attains a maximum for bias current along
[001]$_{\rm o}$, and it vanishes for bias current along [1-10]$_{\rm o}$. The
observed $\alpha$-dependent nonlinear and nonreciprocal signals in longitudinal
and transverse channels reveal a magnetic Weyl phase with an effective Berry
curvature dipole along [1-10]$_{\rm o}$ from surface states, accompanied by 1D
chiral edge modes along [001]$_{\rm o}$.

Stable and metastable metallic nanoparticles exhibit unique properties
compared to the bulk, with potentially important applications for catalysis.
This is in particular the case for the AgPt alloy that can exhibit the ordered
L1$_1$ structure (alternation of pure Ag and Pt (111) planes) in nanometer size
particles. However, for such small systems, the interfaces play an important
role. Therefore, the support used to elaborate the nanoparticles in ultrahigh
vacuum experiments may influence their properties, even in the case of weakly
interacting substrates like amorphous carbon or silica. This work focuses on
the AgPt nanoparticles deposited on silica, and investigates the effect of the
support disorder and roughness on the structure and chemical ordering, in
particular at the interface with the substrate, by Monte Carlo calculations of
the atomic density profiles with semi-empiric potentials.

The global rate of anthropogenic CO2 emission is rising, which urges the
development of efficient carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Among
the various CO2 capture methods, adsorption by the linkers of the Metal-Organic
Frameworks (MOFs) materials has received more interest as excellent CO2
adsorbents because of their important role in understanding the interaction
mechanism for CO2 adsorption. Here, we investigate the adsorption of CO2
molecules at the center and side positions of several MOF-linkers using
molecular cluster models. The interaction between CO2 and the linkers is
approximated by computing the binding enthalpy ({\Delta}H) through the first
principles-based Density Functional Theory with Grimmes dispersion correction
(i.e., B3LYP-D3) and second-order Moller Plesset Theory (MP2). The computed
values of {\Delta}H indicate the weak nature of CO2 adsorption on the pristine
linkers, hence the strategy of lithium decoration is used to see its impact on
the binding strength. Among the various linkers tested, CO2 adsorbing at the
side position of the DFBDC-2 linker has strong adsorption with {\Delta}H value
of about -35.32 kJ/mol computed by the B3LYP-D3 method. The Energy
Decomposition Analysis (EDA) study reveals that among all the energy terms, the
contribution of electrostatic and polarization energy terms to the {\Delta}H
value are the most dominant one. Furthermore, the results of Frontier Molecular
Orbital Analysis (FMO) revealed that all the linkers remained stable even after
Li-decoration. The results of our investigations will direct towards the
development and synthesis of novel adsorbents with enhanced CO2 adsorption.

Strong circularly polarized excitation opens up the possibility to generate
and control effective magnetic fields in solid state systems, e.g., via the
optical inverse Faraday effect or the phonon inverse Faraday effect. While
these effects rely on material properties that can be tailored only to a
limited degree, plasmonic resonances can be fully controlled by choosing proper
dimensions and carrier concentrations. Plasmon resonances provide new degrees
of freedom that can be used to tune or enhance the light-induced magnetic field
in engineered metamaterials. Here we employ graphene disks to demonstrate
light-induced transient magnetic fields from a plasmonic circular current with
extremely high efficiency. The effective magnetic field at the plasmon
resonance frequency of the graphene disks (3.5 THz) is evidenced by a strong
(~1{\deg}) ultrafast Faraday rotation (~ 20 ps). In accordance with reference
measurements and simulations, we estimated the strength of the induced magnetic
field to be on the order of 0.7 T under a moderate pump fluence of about 440 nJ
cm-2.

We present a hybrid scheme based on classical density functional theory and
machine learning for determining the equilibrium structure and thermodynamics
of inhomogeneous fluids. The exact functional map from the density profile to
the one-body direct correlation function is represented locally by a deep
neural network. We substantiate the general framework for the hard sphere fluid
and use grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation data of systems in randomized
external environments during training and as reference. Functional calculus is
implemented on the basis of the neural network to access higher-order
correlation functions via automatic differentiation and the free energy via
functional line integration. Thermal Noether sum rules are validated
explicitly. We demonstrate the use of the neural functional in the
self-consistent calculation of density profiles. The results outperform those
from state-of-the-art fundamental measure density functional theory. The low
cost of solving an associated Euler-Lagrange equation allows to bridge the gap
from the system size of the original training data to macroscopic predictions
upon maintaining near-simulation microscopic precision. These results establish
the machine learning of functionals as an effective tool in the multiscale
description of soft matter.

work, we have built six different Schwarzites structures with multiple
interlocked layers, which we named architecturally interlocked
petal-schwarzites (AIPS). These complex structures are 3D printed into
macroscopic dimensions and compressed using uniaxial compression. The
experimental results show a strong dependency of mechanical response on the
number of layers and topology of the layers. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics
compressive simulations were also carried out, and the results are in good
agreement with experimental observations. They can explain the underlying AIPS
mechanism of high specific strength and energy absorption. The proposed
approach opens a new perspective on developing new 3D-printed materials with
tunable and enhanced mechanical properties.

Synchronization has received a lot of attention from the scientific community
for systems evolving on static networks or higher-order structures, such as
hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. In many relevant real world applications,
the latter are not static but do evolve in time, in this paper we thus discuss
the impact of the time-varying nature of high-order structures in the emergence
of global synchronization.
To achieve this goal we extend the master stability formalism to account, in
a general way, for the additional contributions arising from the time evolution
of the higher-order structure supporting the dynamical systems. The theory is
successfully challenged against two illustrative examples, the Stuart-Landau
nonlinear oscillator and the Lorenz chaotic oscillator.

A stable polymorph of CrO$_2$ is predicted using PBE+U method. The porous
material is isostructural with $\alpha$-MnO$_2$ making it the second transition
metal oxide in sparse hollandite group of materials. However, unlike the
anti-ferromagnetic semiconducting character of the $\alpha$-MnO$_2$, it is
found to be a ferromagnetic half-metal. At Fermi level, the hole pocket has
ample contribution from O-2$p$ orbital, though, the electron pocket is mostly
contributed by Cr-3$d_{xy}$ and Cr-3d$_{x^2-y^2}$. A combination of negative
charge transfer through orbital mixing and extended anti-bonding state near
Fermi level is responsible for the half-metallic ferromagnetic character of the
structure. A comparative study of rutile and hollandite CrO$_2$ and hollandite
MnO$_2$ structures delineate the interplay between structural, electronic and
magnetic properties. The material shows a robust magnetic character under
hydrothermal pressure, as well as, the band topology is conserved under
uniaxial strain. Moderate magneto-crystalline anisotropy is observed and it
shows a correspondence with the anisotropy of elastic constants.

<br>
<br>
Charge density waves are emergent quantum states that spontaneously reduce
crystal symmetry, drive metal-insulator transitions, and precede
superconductivity. In low-dimensions, distinct quantum states arise, however,
thermal fluctuations and external disorder destroy long-range order. Here we
stabilize ordered two-dimensional (2D) charge density waves through endotaxial
synthesis of confined monolayers of 1T-TaS$_2$. Specifically, an ordered
incommensurate charge density wave (oIC-CDW) is realized in 2D with
dramatically enhanced amplitude and resistivity. By enhancing CDW order, the
hexatic nature of charge density waves becomes observable. Upon heating via
in-situ TEM, the CDW continuously melts in a reversible hexatic process wherein
topological defects form in the charge density wave. From these results, new
regimes of the CDW phase diagram for 1T-TaS$_2$ are derived and consistent with
the predicted emergence of vestigial quantum order.

Materials based on spin crossover (SCO) molecules have centred the attention
in Molecular Magnetism for more than forty years as they provide unique
examples of multifunctional and stimuli-responsive materials, which can be then
integrated into electronic devices to exploit their molecular bistability. This
process often requires the preparation of thermally stable SCO molecules that
can sublime and remain intact in contact with surfaces. However, the number of
robust sublimable SCO molecules is still very scarce. Here we report a novel
example of this kind. It is based on a neutral iron (II) coordination complex
formulated as [FeII(neoim)2], where neoimH is the ionogenic ligand
2-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)-9-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline. In the first part a
comprehensive study, which covers the synthesis and magneto-structural
characterization of the [FeII(neoim)2] complex as a bulk microcrystalline
material, is reported. Then, in the second part we investigate the suitability
of this material to form thin films through high vacuum (HV) sublimation.
Finally, the retainment of all present SCO capabilities in the bulk when the
material is processed is thoroughly studied by means of X-ray absorption
spectroscopy. In particular, a very efficient and fast light-induced spin
transition (LIESST effect) has been observed, even for ultrathin films of 15
nm.

Twisted van der Waals materials have risen as highly tunable platform for
realizing unconventional superconductivity. Here we demonstrate how a
topological superconducting state can be driven in a twisted graphene
multilayer at a twist angle of approximately 1.6 degrees proximitized to other
2D materials. We show that an encapsulated twisted bilayer subject to induced
Rashba spin-orbit coupling, s-wave superconductivity and exchange field
generates a topological superconducting state enabled by the moire pattern. We
demonstrate a variety of topological states with different Chern numbers highly
tunable through doping, strain and bias voltage. Our proposal does not depend
on a fine tuning of the twist angle, but solely on the emergence of moire
minibands and is applicable for twist angles between 1.3 and 3 degrees. Our
results establish the potential of twisted graphene bilayers to create
artificial topological superconductivity without requiring ultraflat
dispersions.

In this paper we establish a connection between the bulk topological
structure and the magnetic properties of drumhead surface states of nodal loop
semimetals. We identify the magnetic characteristics of the surface states and
compute the system's magnon spectrum by treating electron-electron interactions
on a mean-field level. We draw attention to a subtle connection between a
Lifshitz-like transition of the surface states driven by mechanical distortions
and the magnetic characteristics of the system. Our findings may be
experimentally verified e.g. by spin polarized electron energy loss
spectroscopy of nodal semimetal surfaces.

<h3>Instability of Pa$\overline 3$ Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ at ambient pressure and  superconducting state of the FCC phase</h3>

The alkali-doped fulleride Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$, crystallized in the space group
Fm$\overline 3$m or Pm$\overline 3$n, exhibits unconventional $s$-wave
superconductivity under pressure with a maximum $T_c\sim 38$ K. Recently, a new
primitive-cubic-structured Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ phase corresponding to the space
group Pa$\overline 3$ has been reported (arXiv:2208.09429) and the authors
observed superconductivity at ambient pressure. Using density-functional theory
(DFT) calculations, we show that the proposed Pa$\overline 3$ structure is not
stable under ionic relaxation, but transforms into the FCC structure. We study
the normal and superconducting state of the stable FCC phase at different
temperatures and volumes using DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT)
in the Nambu formalism. As temperature increases, the transition between
superconductor and normal metal (Mott insulator) at small (big) volume is found
to be second (first) order. The recently developed maximum entropy analytic
continuation method for the anomalous-self-energy is used to study the
momentum-resolved spectra and optical conductivity.

Simulating electronic behavior in materials and devices with realistic large
system sizes remains a formidable task within the $ab$ $initio$ framework. We
propose DeePTB, an efficient deep learning-based tight-binding (TB) approach
with $ab$ $initio$ accuracy to address this issue. By training with $ab$
$initio$ eigenvalues, our method can efficiently predict TB Hamiltonians for
unseen structures. This capability facilitates efficient simulation of
large-size systems under external perturbations like strain, which are vital
for semiconductor band gap engineering. Moreover, DeePTB, combined with
molecular dynamics, can be used to perform efficient and accurate finite
temperature simulations of both atomic and electronic behavior simultaneously.
This is demonstrated by computing the temperature-dependent properties of a GaP
system with $10^6$ atoms.

We study the interaction between heterogeneously charged surfaces in an
electrolyte solution by employing classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT)
and Monte Carlo simulations. We observe a consistent behavior between cDFT and
Monte Carlo simulations regarding force curves and two-dimensional density
profiles. Armed with the validated cDFT, we explore the system's behavior under
parameters challenging to simulate directly .Our findings include impacts of
domain size, domain charge, domain charge configuration, and bulk electrolyte
concentration on the osmotic pressure. Remarkably, the force curve is more
sensitive to the domain size for asymmetric configuration than symmetry
configuration; the bulk concentration weakly influences the force curve
independent of the system configurations.

<h3>The high-pressure phase diagram of BaNi$_2$As$_2$: unconventional  charge-density-waves and structural phase transitions</h3>

Structural phase transitions accompanied with incommensurate and commensurate
charge-density-waves (CDWs) modulations of unconventional nature have been
reported in BaNi$_2$As$_2$, a non-magnetic cousin of the parent compound of
Fe-based superconductors, BaFe$_2$As$_2$. The strong dependence of
BaNi$_2$As$_2$ upon isoelectronic substitutions alongside original dynamical
lattice effects suggest a strong tunability of the electronic phase of the
system through structural effects. To gain further insights, we present a
comprehensive synchrotron x-ray diffraction and first-principles calculation
study of the evolution of the crystal structure and lattice instabilities of
BaNi$_2$As$_2$ as function of temperature and hydrostatic pressures (up to 12
GPa). We report a cascade of pressure-induced structural phase transitions and
electronic instabilities up to ca. 10 GPa, above which all CDW superstructures
disappear. We reveal that the stable high-pressure phase consists of planar Ni
zigzag chains, from which the surrounding As have been pushed away. This yields
a strong reduction of the interlayer As-As distance (along the original $c$
axis), akin to what is observed in the collapsed tetragonal structure of other
pnictides, albeit here with a monoclinic structure. The discovery of new
polymorphs in the pressure-temperature phase diagram of BaNi$_2$As$_2$
emphasizes the importance of the relative Ni-Ni and Ni-As bond lengths in
controlling the electronic ground state of this compound and replenish our
understanding of viable electronic phases under extreme conditions.

<h3>Increasing Flips per Second and Speed of p-Computers by Using Dilute  Magnetic Semiconductors to Implement Binary Stochastic Neurons</h3>

Probabilistic computing with binary stochastic neurons (BSN) implemented with
low- or zero-energy barrier nanoscale ferromagnets (LBMs) possessing in-plane
magnetic anisotropy has emerged as an efficient paradigm for solving
computationally hard problems. The fluctuating magnetization of an LBM at room
temperature encodes a p-bit which is the building block of a BSN. Its only
drawback is that the dynamics of common (transition metal) ferromagnets are
relatively slow and hence the number of uncorrelated p-bits that can be
generated per second - the so-called "flips per second" (fps) - is
insufficient, leading to slow computational speed in autonomous co-processing
with p-computers. Here, we show that a simple way to increase fps is to replace
commonly used ferromagnets (e.g. Co, Fe, Ni), which have large saturation
magnetization Ms, with a dilute magnetic semiconductor like GaMnAs with much
smaller saturation magnetization. The smaller Ms reduces the energy barrier
within the LBM and increases the fps significantly. It also offers other
benefits such as increased packing density for increased parallelization and
reduced device to device variation. This provides a way to realize the hardware
acceleration and energy efficiency promise of p-computers.

<h3>Reversal of the skyrmion topological deflection across ferrimagnetic  angular momentum compensation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Due to their non-trivial topology, skyrmions describe deflected trajectories,
which hinders their straight propagation in nanotracks and can lead to their
annihilation at the track edges. This deflection is caused by a gyrotropic
force proportional to the topological charge and the angular momentum density
of the host film. In this article we present clear evidence of the reversal of
the topological deflection angle of skyrmions with the sign of angular momentum
density. We measured the skyrmion trajectories across the angular momentum
compensation temperature (TAC) in GdCo thin films, a rare earth/transition
metal ferrimagnetic alloy. The sample composition was used to engineer the
skyrmion stability below and above the TAC. A refined comparison of their
dynamical properties evidenced a reversal of the skyrmions deflection angle
with the total angular momentum density. This reversal is a clear demonstration
of the possibility of tuning the skyrmion deflection angle in ferrimagnetic
materials and paves the way for deflection-free skyrmion devices.

Studies of light-induced demagnetization started with the experiment
performed by Beaupaire et al. on nickel. Here, we present theoretical
predictions for X-ray induced demagnetization of nickel, with X-ray photon
energies tuned to its $M_3$ and $L_3$ absorption edges. We show that the
specific feature in the density of states of the d-band of Ni, a sharp peak
located just above the Fermi level, strongly influences the change of the
predicted magnetic signal, making it stronger than in the previously studied
case of cobalt. We believe that this finding will inspire future experiments on
magnetic processes in X-ray irradiated nickel.

We study the dynamical behaviour of mesoscopic systems in contact with a
thermal bath, described either via the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation for
the probability distribution function at the ensemble level -- or the
corresponding non-linear Langevin equation at the trajectory level. Our focus
is put on one-dimensional -- or $d$-dimensional isotropic -- systems in
confining potentials, with detailed balance -- fluctuation-dissipation thus
holds, and the stationary probability distribution has the canonical form at
the bath temperature. When quenching the bath temperature to low enough values,
a far-from-equilibrium state emerges that rules the dynamics over a
characteristic intermediate timescale. Such a long-lived state has a
Dirac-delta probability distribution function and attracts all solutions over
this intermediate timescale, in which the initial conditions are immaterial
while the influence of the bath is still negligible. Numerical evidence and
qualitative physical arguments suggest that the above picture extends to
higher-dimensional systems, with anisotropy and interactions.

Hyperbolic lattices are starting to be explored in search of novel phases of
matter. At the same time, non-Hermitian physics has come to the forefront in
photonic, optical, phononic, and condensed matter systems. In this work, we
introduce non-Hermitian hyperbolic matter and elucidate its exceptional
properties in depth. We use hyperbolic Bloch theory to investigate band
structures of hyperbolic lattices in the presence of non-Hermitian on-site gain
and loss as well as non-reciprocal hopping. Using various analytical and
numerical approaches we demonstrate widely accessible and tunable exceptional
points and contours in {10,5} tessellations, which we characterize using phase
rigidity, energy scaling, and vorticity. We further demonstrate the occurrence
of higher-order exceptional points and contours in the {8,4} tessellations
using the method of Newton polygons, supported by vorticity and phase rigidity
computations. Finally, we investigate the open boundary spectra and densities
of states to compare with results from band theory, along with a demonstration
of boundary localisation. Our results unveil an abundance of exceptional
degeneracies in hyperbolic non-Hermitian matter.

Quantum oscillations can reveal Fermi surfaces and their topology in solids
and provide a powerful tool for understanding transport and electronic
properties. It is well established that the oscillation frequency maps the
Fermi surface area by Onsager's relation. However, the topological phase
accumulated along the quantum orbit remains difficult to estimate in
calculations, because it includes multiple contributions from the Berry phase,
orbital and spin moments, and also becomes gauge-sensitive for degenerate
states. In this work, we develop a gauge-independent Wilson loop scheme to
evaluate all topological phase contributions and apply it to CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, an
emerging kagome metal. We find that the spin-orbit coupling dramatically alters
the topological phase compared to the spinless case. Especially, oscillation
phases of representative quantum orbits demonstrate a strong 3D signature
despite their cylinder-like Fermi surface geometry. Our work reveals the Fermi
surface topology of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and paves the way for the theoretical
investigation of quantum oscillations in realistic materials.
