Machine learning (ML) has become critical for post-acquisition data analysis
in (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, imaging and
spectroscopy. An emerging trend is the transition to real-time analysis and
closed-loop microscope operation. The effective use of ML in electron
microscopy now requires the development of strategies for microscopy-centered
experiment workflow design and optimization. Here, we discuss the associated
challenges with the transition to active ML, including sequential data analysis
and out-of-distribution drift effects, the requirements for the edge operation,
local and cloud data storage, and theory in the loop operations. Specifically,
we discuss the relative contributions of human scientists and ML agents in the
ideation, orchestration, and execution of experimental workflows and the need
to develop universal hyper languages that can apply across multiple platforms.
These considerations will collectively inform the operationalization of ML in
next-generation experimentation.

<h3>Atomic Layer-controlled Nonlinear Terahertz Valleytronics in Dirac  Semi-metal and Semiconductor PtSe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02070" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02070</a>

<br>
<br>
Platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is a promising two-dimensional (2D) material for
the terahertz (THz) range as, unlike other transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs), its bandgap can be uniquely tuned from a semiconductor in the
near-infrared to a semimetal with the number of atomic layers. This gives the
material unique THz photonic properties that can be layer-engineered. Here, we
demonstrate that a controlled THz nonlinearity - tuned from monolayer to bulk
PtSe2 - can be realised in wafer size polycrystalline PtSe2 through the
generation of ultrafast photocurrents and the engineering of the bandstructure
valleys. This is combined with the PtSe2 layer interaction with the substrate
for a broken material centro-symmetry permitting a second order nonlinearity.
Further, we show layer-dependent circular dichroism, where the sign of the
ultrafast currents and hence the phase of the emitted THz pulse can be
controlled through the excitation of different bandstructure valleys. In
particular, we show that a semimetal has a strong dichroism that is absent in
the monolayer and few layer semiconducting limit. The microscopic origins of
this TMD bandstructure engineering is highlighted through detailed DFT
simulations and show that circular dichroism can be controlled when PtSe2
becomes a semimetal and when the K-valleys can be excited. As well as showing
that PtSe2 is a promising material for THz generation through layer controlled
optical nonlinearities, this work opens up new class of circular dichroism
materials beyond the monolayer limit that has been the case of traditional
TMDs, and impacting a range of domains from THz valleytronics, THz spintronics
to harmonic generation.

<h3>Geometrical torque on magnetic moments coupled to a correlated  antiferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02071" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02071</a>
<br>
<i>Nicolas Lenzing, David Krüger, Michael Potthoff</i>
<br>
<br>
The geometrical spin torque mediates an indirect interaction of magnetic
moments, which are weakly exchange coupled to a system of itinerant electrons.
It originates from a finite spin-Berry curvature and leads to a non-Hamiltonian
magnetic-moment dynamics. We demonstrate that there is an unprecedentedly
strong geometrical spin torque in case of an electron system, where
correlations cause antiferromagnetic long-range order. The key observation is
that the anomalous torque is strongly boosted by low-energy magnon modes
emerging in the two-electron spin-excitation spectrum due to spontaneous
breaking of SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry. As long as single-electron
excitations are gapped out, the effect is largely universal, i.e., essentially
independent of the details of the electronic structure, but decisively
dependent on the lattice dimension and spatial and spin anisotropies. Analogous
to the reasoning that leads to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, there is a lower
critical dimension at and below which the spin-Berry curvature diverges.

<h3>Collective nature of orbital excitations in layered cuprates in the  absence of apical oxygens</h3>

Devereaux, Maria Daghofer, Giacomo Ghiringhelli</i>
<br>
<br>
We have investigated the 3d orbital excitations in CaCuO2 (CCO), Nd2CuO4
(NCO) and La2CuO4 (LCO) using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering. In LCO they behave as well-localized excitations, similarly to
several other cuprates. On the contrary, in CCO and NCO the dxy orbital clearly
disperse, pointing to a collective character of this excitation (orbiton) in
compounds without apical oxygen. We ascribe the origin of the dispersion as
stemming from a substantial next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) orbital superexchange.
Such an exchange leads to the liberation of orbiton from its coupling to
magnons, which is associated with the orbiton hopping between nearest neighbor
copper sites. We show that the exceptionally large NNN orbital superexchange
can be traced back to the absence of apical oxygens suppressing the charge
transfer energy.

<h3>Chiral charge as hidden order parameter in URu$_2$Si$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02120" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02120</a>
<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami, Hiroaki Kusunose</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a chiral charge (electric toroidal monopole) as the hidden order
parameter in URu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, which satisfies all the symmetry conditions
accumulated by many experimental and theoretical efforts since its discovery.
By using the minimal effective $d$-$f$ hybridized model in the itinerant
picture, we demonstrate expected cross-correlated phenomena under the chiral
charge ordering, and spatial distribution of the order parameter with surface
or domain boundary. Based on the results, we discuss possible experiments by
using NQR and diffraction measurements under an electric field, or optical
measurements near the surface or domain boundary, although the proposed fully
rotational symmetric order parameter is hard to detect as it is.

<h3>Simulating Cosmological Evolution by Quantum Quench of an Atomic BEC</h3>

<br>
<i>Ke Wang, Han Fu, K. Levin</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we show how to simulate the evolutionary dynamics of the early
universe. We do so through studies of a Bose Einstein condensate of cold atoms
which equilibrates following a quantum quench. The dynamical evolution of such
systems corresponds rather remarkably to counterparts in the three stages of
cosmological evolution; these correspond to ``preheating", ``reheating"
and``thermalization". Importantly, understanding the physics of these processes
yields tractable analytic models for each of these cosmological stages. Such
understanding additionally elucidates the dynamics of non-adiabatic condensate
preparation.

<h3>Picosecond volume expansion drives a later-time insulator-metal  transition in a nano-textured Mott Insulator</h3>

Technology moves towards ever faster switching between different electronic
and magnetic states of matter. Manipulating properties at terahertz rates
requires accessing the intrinsic timescales of electrons (femtoseconds) and
associated phonons (10s of femtoseconds to few picoseconds), which is possible
with short-pulse photoexcitation. Yet, in many Mott insulators, the electronic
transition is accompanied by the nucleation and growth of percolating domains
of the changed lattice structure, leading to empirical time scales dominated by
slow coarsening dynamics. Here, we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction and
reflectivity measurements to investigate the photoinduced insulator-to-metal
transition in an epitaxially strained thin film Mott insulator Ca2RuO4. The
dynamical transition occurs without observable domain formation and coarsening
effects, allowing the study of the intrinsic electronic and lattice dynamics.
Above a fluence threshold, the initial electronic excitation drives a fast
lattice rearrangement, followed by a slower electronic evolution into a
metastable non-equilibrium state. Microscopic calculations based on
time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory and semiclassical lattice dynamics
within a recently published equilibrium energy landscape picture explain the
threshold-behavior and elucidate the delayed onset of the electronic phase
transition in terms of kinematic constraints on recombination. Analysis of
satellite scattering peaks indicates the persistence of a strain-induced
nano-texture in the photoexcited film. This work highlights the importance of
combined electronic and structural studies to unravel the physics of dynamic
transitions and elucidates the role of strain in tuning the timescales of
photoinduced processes.

<h3>Surface roughness induced stress concentration</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
When a body is exposed to external forces large local stresses may occur at
the surface because of surface roughness. Surface stress concentration is
important for many applications and in particular for fatigue due to pulsating
external forces. For randomly rough surfaces I calculate the probability
distribution of surface stress in response to a uniform external tensile stress
with the displacement vector field parallel to the rough surface. I present
numerical simulation results for the stress distribution $\sigma (x,y)$ and
show that in a typical case, the maximum local tensile stress may be $\sim 10$
times bigger than the applied stress. I discuss the role of the stress
concentration on plastic deformation and surface crack generation and
propagation.

<h3>Field emission: applying the "magic emitter" validity test to a recent  paper, and related research-literature integrity issues</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02166</a>
<br>
<i>Richard G. Forbes</i>
<br>
<br>
This work concerns studies of field electron emission (FE) from large area
emitters. It discusses--and where possible corrects--several literature
weaknesses related to the analysis of experimental current-voltage data and
related emitter characterization, using a recent paper in Applied Surface
Science to exemplify these weaknessses. One weakness, not detected in the
published paper, is that current-density experiments and related theoretical
predictions there differ by a large factor, in this case of order 10^(16). The
work also shows that a recently introduced validity test--the "magic emitter"
test--can be used, at the immediate-pre-submission or review stage, to help
uncover scientific problems. More generally, in the literature of FE from large
area emitters over the last 15 years or so, there appear to be many papers
(perhaps hundreds of papers) with some or all of the weaknesses discussed. The
scientific integrity of this research area, and of the related peer review
processes, appear to be significantly broken, and attempts to correct the
situation by the normal processes of science have had limited effect. There
seems a growing case for independent wider investigation into research
integrity issues of this general kind, and possibly for later action by
Governments.

<h3>Photon Bose-Condensate as a Tunable Terahertz Laser Source without  Inversion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02174" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02174</a>
<br>
<i>Timofey V. Maximov, Igor V. Bondarev, Igor L. Kurbakov, Yurii E. Lozovik</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theoretical model for a tunable coherent terahertz radiation
source based on the long-lived Bose condensate of photons. In the device we
propose, the original photon pumping is performed incoherently by a blackbody
radiation emitter. The photons thus produced Bose-condense by the inelastic
relaxation on a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetostatic
field. The process involves neither population inversion nor light wave
amplification the standard laser sources are built on. The coherence and
tunability of the light emitted by such a photon condensate are provided and
supported by the discrete spectrum of the electron gas in the quantizing
magnetic field. The device is a compact-size semiconductor crystal. We propose
the design and perform the realistic calculations of the physical properties
and limiting factors for the terahertz photon Bose-condensate resonator. We
show that our terahertz source can deliver the highly coherent light emission
in the frequency range of 3-30 THz for the magnetic field induction of the
order of 2 T, with the upper emission frequency limit adjustable by the
strength of the magnetic field applied.

<h3>Estimating Patterns of Classical and Quantum Skyrmion States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02201" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02201</a>
<br>
<i>Vladimir V. Mazurenko, Ilia A. Iakovlev, Oleg M. Sotnikov, Mikhail I. Katsnelson</i>
<br>
<br>
In this review we discuss the latest results concerning development of the
machine learning algorithms for characterization of the magnetic skyrmions that
are topologically-protected magnetic textures originated from the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that competes Heisenberg isotropic exchange
in ferromagnets. We show that for classical spin systems there is a whole pool
of machine approaches allowing their accurate phase classification and
quantitative description on the basis of few magnetization snapshots. In turn,
investigation of the quantum skyrmions is a less explored issue, since there
are fundamental limitations on the simulation of such wave functions with
classical supercomputers. One needs to find the ways to imitate quantum
skyrmions on near-term quantum computers. In this respect, we discuss
implementation of the method for estimating structural complexity of classical
objects for characterization of the quantum skyrmion state on the basis of
limited number of bitstrings obtained from the projective measurements.

<h3>Pinch points and half moons encode Berry curvature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02203" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02203</a>
<br>
<i>Han Yan, Andreas Thomasen, Judit Romhányi, Nic Shannon</i>
<br>
<br>
"Half moons", distinctive crescent patterns in the dynamical structure
factor, have been identified in inelastic neutron scattering experiments for a
wide range of frustrated magnets.In an earlier paper [H. Yan et al., Phys. Rev.
B 98, 140402(R) (2018)] we have shown how these features are linked to the
local constraints realized in classical spin liquids. Here we explore their
implication for the topology of magnon bands. The presence of half moons
indicates a separation of magnetic degrees of freedom into irrotational and
incompressible components. Where bands satisfying these constraints meet, it is
at a singular point encoding Berry curvature of $\pm 2\pi$. Interactions which
mix the bands open a gap, resolving the singularity, and leading to bands with
finite Berry curvature, accompanied by characteristic changes to half--moon
motifs. These results imply that inelastic neutron scattering can, in some
cases, be used to make rigorous inference about the topological nature of
magnon bands.

<h3>Identifying topologically critical band from pinch-point singularities  in spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02204" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02204</a>
<br>
<i>Han Yan</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we investigate the relationship between pinch point
singularities observed in energy and momentum resolved spectroscopy and
topologically non-trivial gapless points. We show that these singularities are
a universal signature, and that the Berry flux encoded must be $n\pi$ for an
$n-$fold pinch point under suitable symmetry protection. Our results apply to
most systems and are independent of their microscopic details. We also
demonstrate that these findings have important implications for the field of
condensed matter physics, as they provide a new way to identify topological
phases without requiring detailed knowledge of the material being studied. Our
work has practical applications for spectroscopy experiments on various
platforms and may pave the way for new discoveries in this field.

<h3>Early-Stage Bifurcation of Crystallization in a Sphere</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02215</a>
<br>
<i>Chrameh Fru Mbah, Junwei Wang, Silvan Englisch, Praveen Bommineni, Nydia Roxana Varela-Rosales, Erdmann Spiecker, Nicolas Vogel, Michael Engel</i>
<br>
<br>
Bifurcations in kinetic pathways decide the evolution of a system. An example
is crystallization, in which the thermodynamically stable polymorph may not
form due to kinetic hindrance. Here, we use confined self-assembly to
investigate the interplay of thermodynamics and kinetics in the crystallization
pathways of finite clusters. We report the observation of decahedral clusters
from colloidal particles in emulsion droplets and show that these decahedral
clusters can be thermodynamically stable just like icosahedral clusters. Our
hard sphere simulations reveal how the development of the early nucleus shape
passes through a bifurcation that decides the cluster symmetry. A geometric
argument explains why decahedral clusters are kinetically hindered and why
icosahedral clusters can be dominant even if they are not the thermodynamic
ground state.

<br>
<br>
The efficacy of oxygen (O) surface terminations of specific moieties and
densities on diamond depends on factors such as crystallinity, roughness, and
crystal orientation. Given the wide breadth of diamond-like materials and
O-termination techniques, it can be difficult to discern which method would
yield the highest and most consistent O coverage on a particular subset of
diamond. We first review the relevant physical parameters for O-terminating
single-crystalline diamond (SCD) surfaces and summarize prior oxidation work on
(100) SCD. We then report on our experimental study on X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of (100) diamond surfaces treated with
oxidation methods that include wet chemical oxidation, photochemical oxidation
with UV illumination, and steam oxidation using atomic layer deposition. We
describe a rigorous XPS peak-fitting procedure for measuring the
functionalization of O-terminated samples and recommend that the reporting of
peak energy positions, line shapes, and full-width-half-maximum values of the
individual components, along with the residuals, are important for evaluating
the quality of the peak fit. Two chemical parameters on the surface, sp$^2$ C
and molecular contaminants, are also crucial towards interpreting the O
coverage on the diamond surface and may account for the inconsistency in prior
reported values in literature.

<h3>Identification of high-reliability regions of machine learning  predictions in materials science using transparent conducting oxides and  perovskites as examples</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02218</a>
<br>
<i>Evan M. Askanazi, Emanuel A. Lazar, Ilya Grinberg</i>
<br>
<br>
Progress in the application of machine learning (ML) methods to materials
design is hindered by the lack of understanding of the reliability of ML
predictions, in particular for the application of ML to small data sets often
found in materials science. Using ML prediction for transparent conductor oxide
formation energy and band gap, dilute solute diffusion, and perovskite
formation energy, band gap and lattice parameter as examples, we demonstrate
that 1) analysis of ML results by construction of a convex hull in feature
space that encloses accurately predicted systems can be used to identify
regions in feature space for which ML predictions are highly reliable 2)
analysis of the systems enclosed by the convex hull can be used to extract
physical understanding and 3) materials that satisfy all well-known chemical
and physical principles that make a material physically reasonable are likely
to be similar and show strong relationships between the properties of interest
and the standard features used in ML. We also show that similar to the
composition-structure-property relationships, inclusion in the ML training data
set of materials from classes with different chemical properties will not be
beneficial and will slightly decrease the accuracy of ML prediction and that
reliable results likely will be obtained by ML model for narrow classes of
similar materials even in the case where the ML model will show large errors on
the dataset consisting of several classes of materials. Our work suggests that
analysis of the error distributions of ML predictions will be beneficial for
the further development of the application of ML methods in material science.

<h3>Realizing a Superconducting Square-Lattice Bismuth Monolayer</h3>

<br>
Interplay of crystal symmetry, strong spin$-$orbit coupling (SOC), and
many-body interactions in low dimensional materials provides a fertile ground
for the discovery of unconventional electronic and magnetic properties and
versatile functionalities. Two-dimensional (2D) allotropes of group 15 elements
are appealing due to their structures and controllability over symmetries and
topology under strong SOC. Here, we report the heteroepitaxial growth of a
proximity-induced superconducting 2D square-lattice bismuth monolayer on
superconducting Pb films. The square lattice of monolayer bismuth films in a
$C_4$ symmetry together with a stripey moir\'e structure is clearly resolved by
our scanning tunneling microscopy and its atomic structure is revealed by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A Rashba-type spin-split Dirac
band is predicted by DFT calculations to exist at the Fermi level and becomes
superconducting through the proximity effect from the Pb substrate. We suggest
the possibility of a topological superconducting state in this system with
magnetic dopants/field. This work introduces an intriguing material platform
with 2D Dirac bands, strong SOC, topological superconductivity, and the moir\'e
superstructure.

<h3>Unexpected coexisting solid solutions in the quasi-binary  Ag(II)F2/Cu(II)F2 phase diagram</h3>

<br>
High-temperature solid-state reaction between orthorhombic AgF2 and
monoclinic CuF2 (y = 0.15, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) in a fluorine atmosphere resulted in
coexisting solid solutions of Cu-poor orthorhombic and Cu-rich monoclinic
phases with stoichiometry Ag1-xCuxF2. Based on X-ray powder diffraction
analyses, the mutual solubility in the orthorhombic phase (AgF2 doped with Cu)
appears to be at an upper limit of Cu concentration of 30 mol % (Ag0.7Cu0.3F2),
while the monoclinic phase (CuF2 doped with Ag) can form a nearly
stoichiometric Cu : Ag = 1 : 1 solid solution (Cu0.56Ag0.44F2), preserving the
CuF2 crystal structure. Experimental data and DFT calculations showed that AgF2
doped with Cu and CuF2 doped with Ag solid solutions deviate from the classical
Vegards law. Magnetic measurements of Ag1-xCuxF2 showed that the Neel
temperature (TN) decreases with increasing Cu content in both phases. Likewise,
theoretical DFT+U calculations for Ag1-xCuxF2 showed that the progressive
substitution of Ag by Cu decreases the magnetic interaction strength (J2D) in
both structures. Electrical conductivity measurements of Ag0.85Cu0.15F2 showed
a ca. 2-fold increase in specific ionic conductivity (3.71 x 10-13 plus/minus
2.6 x 10-15 S/cm) as compared to pure AgF2 (1.85 x 10-13 plus/minus 1.2 x 10-15
S/cm), indicating the formation of a vacancy- or F adatom-free metal difluoride
sample.

<h3>Entropy mediated organization of E.coli chromosome in fast growth  conditions</h3>

<br>
Recent experiments have been able to visualise chromosome organization in
fast-growing E.coli cells. However, the mechanism underlying the
spatio-temporal organization remains poorly understood. We propose that the DNA
adopts a specific polymer topology as it goes through its cell cycle. We
establish that the emergent entropic forces between polymer segments of the
DNA-polymer with modified topology, leads to chromosome organization as seen
in-vivo. We employ computer simulations of a replicating bead spring model of a
polymer in a cylinder to investigate the problem. Our simulation of the
overlapping cell cycles not only show successful segregation, but also
reproduces the evolution of the spatial organization of the chromosomes as
observed in experiments. This manuscript in addition to our previous work on
slowly growing bacterial cells, shows that our topology-based model can explain
the organization of chromosomes in all growth conditions.

<h3>Quantum quenches from an excited state</h3>

<br>
<i>Gesualdo Delfino, Marianna Sorba</i>
<br>
<br>
Determining the role of initial conditions in the late time evolution is a
key issue for the theory of nonequilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum
systems. Here we extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case in which
before the quench the system is in an excited state. In particular, we show
analytically that lack of relaxation at large times requires the presence of a
one-quasiparticle contribution to the nonequilibrium state, as originally shown
in [J. Phys. A 47 (2014) 402001] for the quenches from the ground state.

The determination of orientation relationships in dual or multi-phase
materials is very important in the field of interface engineering for the
design of materials with tailored properties. In this work, a code is developed
for the automated and statistical analysis of the orientation relationship of
electron backscatter diffraction data. On the example of Fe-Ni-(Si)-C alloys
containing lenticular martensite and retained austenite, the code is applied
and it is shown that the orientation relationship (OR) corresponds to the
Greninger-Troiano OR and that a statistically reliable investigation of the OR
between the retained austenite and the related martensite variants is feasible
using the code developed in this study.

<br>
<br>
A number of novel two-dimensional materials and nanostructures demonstrate
complex single-electron energy dispersion, which is called the mexican-hat
dispersion. In this paper, we analyze interaction of a pair of electrons with
such an energy dispersion. We show that relative motion of the electron pair is
of a very peculiar character. For example, the real space trajectories
corresponding to electron-electron scattering can have three reversal points,
reversal points at non-zero radial momentum and other unusual features. Despite
the repulsive Coulomb interaction, two electrons can be coupled forming a
composite quasi-particle - the bi-electron. The bi-electron corresponds to
excited states of the two-electron system. Because the bi-electron coupled
states exist in continuum of extended (free) states of the electron pair, these
states are quasi-resonant and have finite times of life. We found that rotating
bi-electron is a long-living composite quasi-particle. The rotating
bi-electrons can be in motion. For slowly moving bi-electrons, we determined
the kinetic energy and the effective mass. Due to strongly nonparabolic energy
dispersion, the translational motion of the bi-electron is coupled to its
internal motion. This results in effective masses dependent on quantum states
of the bi-electron. In the paper, properties of the bi-electron are illustrated
for the example of bigraphene in a transverse electric field.

<h3>Dynamical theory of topological defects I: the multivalued solution of  the diffusion equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02348</a>
<br>
<i>Jacopo Romano, Benoît Mahault, Ramin Golestanian</i>
<br>
<br>
Point-like topological defects are singular configurations that occur in a
variety of in and out of equilibrium systems with two-dimensional orientational
order. As they are associated with a nonzero circuitation condition, the
presence of defects induces a long-range perturbation of the orientation
landscape around them. The effective dynamics of defects is thus generally
described in terms of quasi-particles interacting through the orientation field
they produce, whose evolution in the simplest setting is governed by the
diffusion equation. Due to the multivalued nature of the orientation field, its
expression for a defect moving with an arbitrary trajectory cannot be obtained
straightforwardly and is often evaluated in the quasi-static approximation.
Here, we instead propose an approach that allows to derive the exact expression
for the orientation created by multiple moving defects, which we find to depend
on their past trajectories and thus to be nonlocal in time. Performing various
expansions in relevant regimes, we show how improved approximations with
respect to the quasi-static defect solution can be obtained. Moreover, our
results lead to so far unnoticed structures in the orientation field of moving
defects which we discuss in light of existing experimental results.

We theoretically explore the Floquet generation of Majorana end modes~(MEMs)
(both regular $0$- and anomalous $\pi$-modes) implementing a periodic
sinusoidal modulation in chemical potential in an experimentally feasible setup
based on one-dimensional chain of magnetic impurity atoms having spin spiral
configuration fabricated on the surface of most common bulk $s$-wave
superconductor. We obtain a rich phase diagram in the parameter space,
highlighting the possibility of generating multiple $0$-/$\pi$-MEMs localized
at the end of the chain. We also study the real-time evolution of these
emergent MEMs, especially when they start to appear in the time domain. These
MEMs are topologically characterized by employing the dynamical winding number.
We also discuss the possible experimental parameters in connection to our
model. Our work paves the way to realize the Floquet MEMs in a
magnet-superconductor heterostructure.

<h3>Neural Cellular Automata for Solidification Microstructure Modelling</h3>

<br>
<i>Jian Tang, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis, Ehsan Hosseini</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to simulate the microstructure
development during the solidification process in metals. Based on convolutional
neural networks, NCA can learn essential solidification features, such as
preferred growth direction and competitive grain growth, and are up to six
orders of magnitude faster than the conventional Cellular Automata (CA).
Notably, NCA delivers reliable predictions also outside their training range,
which indicates that they learn the physics of the solidification process.
While in this study we employ data produced by CA for training, NCA can be
trained based on any microstructural simulation data, e.g. from phase-field
models.

<h3>Partially deorbitalized meta-GGA</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02363</a>
<br>
<i>Pietro Bonfà, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst</i>
<br>
<br>
Mejia-Rodriguez and Trickey recently proposed a procedure for removing the
explicit dependence of meta-GGA exchange-correlation energy functionals $E_{\rm
xc}$ on the kinetic energy density $\tau$. We present a simple modification to
this approach in which the exact Kohn-Sham $\tau$ is used as input for $E_{\rm
xc}$ but the functional derivative of $\tau$ with respect to the density
$\rho$, required to calculate the potential term $\int d^3r'\,\delta E_{\rm
xc}/\delta\tau({\bf r}')|_{\rho}\cdot
\delta\tau({\bf r}')/\delta\rho({\bf r})$, is evaluated using an approximate
kinetic energy density functional. This ensures that the Kohn-Sham potential is
a local multiplicative function as opposed to the non-local potential of a
generalized Kohn-Sham approach. Electronic structure codes can be easily
modified to use the new method. We validate it by quantifying the accuracy of
the predicted lattice parameters, bulk moduli, magnetic moments and cohesive
energies of a large set of periodic solids. An unanticipated benefit of this
method is to gauge the quality of approximate kinetic energy functionals by
checking if the self-consistent solution is indeed at the variational minimum.

<br>
<i>R. Mosseri, J. Vidal</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the energy spectrum of tight-binding Hamiltonian for regular
hyperbolic tilings. More specifically, we compute the density of states using
the continued-fraction expansion of the Green function on finite-size systems
with more than $10^9$ sites and open boundary conditions. The coefficients of
this expansion are found to quickly converge so that the thermodynamical limit
can be inferred quite accurately. This density of states is in stark contrast
with the prediction stemming from the recently proposed hyperbolic band theory.
Thus, we conclude that the fraction of the energy spectrum described by the
hyperbolic Bloch-like wave eigenfunctions vanishes in the thermodynamical
limit.

This comparative study allows to evaluate the performance of an
electromagnetic jet to determine the electromagnetic response of materials,
without being in usual far field conditions. In this work, the reflection
coefficient of a substrate with ground plane, calculated analytically, is
compared with that determined in simulation by the electromagnetic jet. The
results show a satisfactory agreement after calibrating the simulated
reflection coefficient at the focal point of the jet. Thus, we were able to
find, by a local measurement, data consistent with a classical free space type
measurement.

<h3>Quantum Mpemba effect in a quantum dot with reservoirs</h3>

<br>
<i>Amit Kumar Chatterjee, Satoshi Takada, Hisao Hayakawa</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the quantum Mpemba effect in a quantum dot coupled to two
reservoirs, described by the Anderson model. We show that the system
temperatures starting from two different initial values (hot and cold), cross
each other at finite time (and thereby reverse their identities i.e. hot
becomes cold and vice versa) to generate thermal quantam Mpemba effect. The
slowest relaxation mode believed to play the dominating role in Mpemba effect
in Markovian systems, does not contribute to such anomalous relaxation in the
present model. In this connection, our analytical result provides necessary
condition for producing quantum Mpemba effect in the density matrix elements of
the quantum dot, as a combined effect of the remaining relaxation modes.

<h3>Effective model for superconductivity in magic-angle graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02428</a>
<br>
<i>Disha Hou, Yuhai Liu, Toshihiro Sato, Fakher F. Assaad, Wenan Guo, Zhenjiu Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We carry out large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a candidate field
theory for the onset of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene. The correlated insulating state at charge neutrality spontaneously
breaks U(1) Moir\'e valley symmetry. Owing to the topological nature of the
bands, skyrmion defects of the order parameter carry charge $2e$ and condense
upon doping. In our calculations we encode the U(1) symmetry by an internal
degree of freedom such that it is not broken upon lattice regularization.
Furthermore, the skyrmion carries the same charge. The nature of the
doping-induced phase transitions depends on the strength of the easy-plane
anisotropy that reduces the SU(2) valley symmetry to U(1) $\times \mathbb{Z}_2
$. For large anisotropy, we observe two distinct transitions separated by phase
coexistence. While the insulator to superconducting transition is of mean-field
character, the U(1) transition is consistent with three-dimensional XY
criticality. Hence, the coupling between the gapless charge excitations of the
superconducting phase and the XY order parameter is irrelevant. At small
anisotropy, we observe a first-order transition characterized by phase
separation.

<h3>Coupling of the triplet states of a negatively charged exciton in a  quantum dot with the spin of a magnetic atom</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Two electrons in a quantum dot (QD) can form triplet states. We analyze the
exchange coupling of the triplet states of the negatively charged exciton in a
QD (X$^-$, two electrons and one hole) with the spin of a magnetic atom (Mn).
Two techniques are used to access the spin structure of this magnetic complex:
the resonant excitation of the excited states of X$^-$-Mn and the analysis of
the emission of a negatively charged biexciton in a magnetic dot (XX$^-$-Mn).
The photo-luminescence (PL) excitation of X$^-$-Mn reveals excited states with
a circularly polarized fine structure which strongly depends on the Mn spin
state S$_z$ and gives rise to negative circular polarization emission. This
fine structure arises from the coupling of the triplet states of an excited
charged exciton with the Mn (X$^{-*}$-Mn) and its S$_z$ dependence can be
described by a spin effective model. The recombination of XX$^-$-Mn leaves in
the dot a charged exciton in its excited state and the PL structure is
controlled by the coupling of triplet states of X$^{-*}$ with the Mn spin. An
analysis of the polarization and magneto-optic properties of this emission
gives access to the electron-hole exchange interaction within the triplets
states. Comparing the fine structure of the singlet X$^-$-Mn and of the
triplets of X$^{-*}$-Mn we can independently study the different source of
anisotropy in the QD: the valence band mixing and the exchange interaction in
an anisotropic potential

<br>
<i>G. A. P. Ribeiro, Gustavo Rigolin</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the quantum teleportation protocol is a powerful tool to study
quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at finite temperatures. We consider a pair of
spins from an infinite spin-1/2 chain (XXZ model) in equilibrium with a
reservoir at temperature T as the resource used by Alice and Bob to implement
the teleportation protocol. We show that the efficiency of this pair of spins
to teleport a qubit is drastically affected after we cross a quantum critical
point (QCP), even for high values of T. Also, we show that the present tool is
as sharp as quantum discord (QD) to spotlight a QCP, where QD is the best
finite T QCP detector known to date. Contrary to QD, however, we show that the
present tool is easier to compute theoretically and has a direct experimental
and operational meaning.

<h3>Elastocapillary menisci mediate interaction of neighboring structures at  the surface of a compliant solid</h3>

<br>
<i>Lebo Molefe, John Kolinski</i>
<br>
<br>
Surface stress drives long-range elastocapillary interactions at the surface
of compliant solids, where it has been observed to mediate interparticle
interactions and to alter the transport of liquid drops. We show that such an
elastocapillary interaction arises between neighboring structures that are
simply protrusions of the compliant solid. For compliant micropillars arranged
in a square lattice with spacing p less than an interaction distance p*, the
distance of a pillar to its neighbors determines how much it deforms due to
surface stress: pillars that are close together tend to be rounder and flatter
than those that are far apart. The interaction is mediated by the formation of
an elastocapillary meniscus at the base of each pillar, which sets the
interaction distance and causes neighboring structures to deform more than
those that are relatively isolated. Neighboring pillars also displace toward
each other to form clusters, leading to the emergence of pattern formation and
ordered domains.

<h3>Many-Exciton Quantum Dynamics in a Ruddlesden-Popper Tin Iodide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02461" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02461</a>

<i>Esteban Rojas Gatjens, Hao Li, Alejandro Vega Flick, Daniele Cortecchia, Annamaria Petrozza, Eric R. Bittner, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada, Carlos Silva Acuña</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a study on the many-body exciton interactions in a prototype
Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide (RPMH), namely \ce{(PEA)2SnI4} (PEA =
phenylethylammine), using coherent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. The
optical dephasing times of the third-order polarization observed in these
systems are determined by exciton many-body interactions and lattice
fluctuations. We investigate the excitation-induced dephasing (EID) and observe
a significant reduction of the contribution to the dephasing time with
increasing excitation density as compared to its lead counterpart
\ce{(PEA)2PbI4}, which we have previously reported
[A.~R.~Srimath~Kandada~\textit{et~al.}, J.\ Chem.\ Phys.\ \textbf{153}, 164706
(2020)]. Surprisingly, we find that the EID interaction parameter is four
orders of magnitude higher in \ce{(PEA)2SnI4} than that in \ce{(PEA)2PbI4}.
This increase in the EID rate may be due to exciton localization arising from a
more strongly statically disordered lattice in the tin derivative. This is
supported by the observation of multiple closely spaced exciton states and the
broadening of the linewidth with increasing population time (spectral
diffusion), which suggests a static disordered structure relative to the highly
dynamic lead-halide. Additionally, we find that the exciton nonlinear coherent
lineshape shows evidence of a biexcitonic state with low binding energy
($<10$\,meV) not observed in the lead system. We model the lineshapes based on
a stochastic scattering theory that accounts for the interaction with a
non-stationary population of dark background excitations. Our study provides
evidence of differences in the exciton quantum dynamics between tin- and
lead-based RPMHs and links them to the exciton-exciton interaction strength and
the static disorder aspect of the crystalline structure.

The theoretical and computational framework of finite deformation mesoscale
field dislocation mechanics (MFDM) is used to understand the salient aspects of
kink-band formation in Cu-Nb nano-metallic laminates (NMLs). A conceptually
minimal, plane-strain idealization of the three-dimensional geometry, including
crystalline orientation, of additively manufactured NML is used to model NMLs.
Importantly, the natural jump/interface condition of MFDM imposing continuity
of (certain components) of plastic strain rates across interfaces allows
theory-driven `communication' of plastic flow across the laminate boundaries in
our finite element implementation. Kink bands under layer parallel compression
of NMLs in accord with experimental observations arise in our numerical
simulations. The possible mechanisms for the formation and orientation of kink
bands are discussed, within the scope of our idealized framework. We also
report results corresponding to various parametric studies that provide
preliminary insights and clear questions for future work on understanding the
intricate underlying mechanisms for the formation of kink bands.

<br>
Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors exhibit strong
excitonic effects and hold promise for optical and optoelectronic applications.
Yet, electron doping of TMDs leads to the conversion of neutral excitons into
negative trions, which recombine predominantly non-radiatively at room
temperature. As a result, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity is quenched.
Here we study the optical and electronic properties of a MoS2/WSe2
heterostructure as a function of chemical doping by Cs atoms performed under
ultra-high vacuum conditions. By PL measurements we identify two interlayer
excitons and assign them to the momentum-indirect Q-Gamma and K-Gamma
transitions. The energies of these excitons are in a very good agreement with
ab initio calculations. We find that the Q-Gamma interlayer exciton is robust
to the electron doping and is present at room temperature even at a high charge
carrier concentration. Submicrometer angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(micro-ARPES) reveals charge transfer from deposited Cs adatoms to both the
upper MoS2 and the lower WSe2 monolayer without changing the band alignment.
This leads to a small (10 meV) energy shift of interlayer excitons. Robustness
of the momentum-indirect interlayer exciton to charge doping opens up an
opportunity of using TMD heterostructures in light-emitting devices that can
work at room temperature at high densities of charge carriers.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is well known in quantum
metrology and quantum information for its favorable spin and optical
properties, which span a wide temperature range from near zero to over 600 K.
Despite its prominence, the NV center's photo-physics is incompletely
understood, especially at intermediate temperatures between 10-100 K where
phonons become activated. In this work, we present a rate model able to
describe the cross-over from the low-temperature to the high-temperature
regime. Key to the model is a phonon-driven hopping between the two orbital
branches in the excited state (ES), which accelerates spin relaxation via an
interplay with the ES spin precession. We extend our model to include magnetic
and electric fields as well as crystal strain, allowing us to simulate the
population dynamics over a wide range of experimental conditions. Our model
recovers existing descriptions for the low- and high-temperature limits, and
successfully explains various sets of literature data. Further, the model
allows us to predict experimental observables, in particular the
photoluminescence (PL) emission rate, spin contrast, and spin initialization
fidelity relevant for quantum applications. Lastly, our model allows probing
the electron-phonon interaction of the NV center and reveals a gap between the
current understanding and recent experimental findings.

<br>
Dielectric nanoresonators have been shown to circumvent the heavy optical
losses associated with plasmonic devices, however they suffer from less
confined resonances. By constructing a hybrid system of both dielectric and
metallic materials, one can retain the low losses of dielectric resonances,
whilst gaining additional control over the tuning of the modes with the metal,
and achieving stronger mode confinement. In particular, multi-layered van der
Waals materials are emerging as promising candidates for integration with
metals owing to their weak attractive forces, which enable deposition onto such
substrates without the requirement of lattice matching. Here we use layered,
high refractive index WS$_2$ exfoliated on gold, to fabricate and optically
characterize a hybrid nanoantenna-on-gold system. We experimentally observe a
hybridization of Mie resonances, Fabry-P\'erot modes, and surface
plasmon-polaritons launched from the nanoantennas into the substrate. We
achieve experimental quality factors of Mie-plasmonic modes of up to 20 times
that of Mie resonances in nanoantennas on silica, and observe signatures of a
supercavity mode with a Q factor of 263 $\pm$ 28, resulting from strong mode
coupling between a higher-order anapole and Fabry-P\'erot-plasmonic mode. We
further simulate WS$_2$ nanoantennas on gold with an hBN spacer, resulting in
calculated electric field enhancements exceeding 2600, and a Purcell factor of
713. Our results demonstrate dramatic changes in the optical response of
dielectric nanophotonic structures placed on gold, opening new possibilities
for nanophotonics and sensing with simple-to-fabricate devices.

Inelastic neutron scattering is used to study the magnetic excitations of the
$S=1$ square-lattice antiferromagnet La$_2$NiO$_4$. We find that the spin waves
cannot be described by a simple classical (harmonic) Heisenberg model with only
nearest-neighbor interactions. The spin-wave dispersion measured along the
antiferromagnetic Brillouin-zone boundary shows a minimum energy at the
$(1/2,0)$ position as is observed in some $S=1/2$ square-lattice
antiferromagnets. Thus, our results suggest that the quantum dispersion
renormalization effects or longer-range exchange interactions observed in
cuprates and other $S=1/2$ square-lattice antiferromagnets are also present in
La$_2$NiO$_4$. We also find that the overall intensity of the spin-wave
excitations is suppressed relative to linear spin-wave theory indicating that
covalency is important. Two-magnon scattering is also observed.

We synthesize geometrically tailorable anisotropic plates by combining button
shaped fish-scale like features on soft substrates, then lacing them with
high-stiffness strings. This creates a new type of biomimetic architectured
structure with multiple broken symmetries. First, the tendons and scales
together break the symmetry of the bending response between the concave and
convex curvature. Next, the weave pattern of the tendons further breaks
symmetry along the two directors of plates. The anisotropy is clearly evident
in 3-point bending experiments. Motivated by these experiments and the need for
design, we formulate the analytical energy-based model to quantify the
anisotropic elasticity and tailorable Poisson's ratio. The derived
architecture-property relationships can be used to design architected tendon
plates with desirable properties.

<i>Rachel Wortis, Eamonn Campbell, Donovan Allum</i>

Previous work proposed a strong-disorder renormalization approach for the
Anderson model, using it to calculate the density of states and the inverse
participation ratio [Johri \& Bhatt, Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 90} 060205(R) (2014)].
This is interesting because of the potential for expansion to higher dimensions
and to interacting systems. The original proposal used a non-standard
perturbation theory approach which avoided degeneracies. We implemented the
same structure but with standard Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory.
Here degeneracies do arise, and we consider two approaches, one in which
renormalization is suppressed if degeneracy is present and a second in which
the most common form of degeneracy is handled using standard degenerate
perturbation theory. The version in which degeneracies are not handled performs
similarly to the original proposal, and the addition of degeneracies provides
some improvement.

Despite significant achievements in characterizing the properties of
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ over the last three decades, the precise nature of its electronic
ground state is still unresolved. In this work, we provide a missing piece of
the puzzle by uncovering evidence of electronic nematic order in the normal
state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, revealed by ultrafast time-resolved optical dichroism
measurements of uniaxially strained thin films. This nematic order, whose
domains are aligned by the strain, spontaneously breaks the four-fold
rotational symmetry of the crystal. The temperature dependence of the dichroism
resembles an Ising-like order parameter, and optical pumping induces a coherent
oscillation of its amplitude mode. A microscopic model of intra-unit-cell
nematic order is presented, highlighting the importance of Coulomb repulsion
between neighboring oxygen $p$-orbitals. The existence of electronic nematic
order in the normal state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ may have consequences for the form
and mechanism of superconductivity in this material.

dynamics in the presence of spin-orbit coupling has been only recently
predicted [{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{105}, L180415 (2022)}]. In this effect, the
number of the excited high harmonics is found to scale up with the spin-orbit
coupling parameter, the s-d exchange constant of the magnetic system and the
frequency of the driving dynamics. Motivated by the reproduction of the
above-mentioned effect, Nikoli\'{c} and Manjarres [arXiv:2212.06895,
arXiv:2112.14685] confirmed that there is indeed a generation of harmonics as a
result of the interplay between magnetic dynamics and spin-orbit interaction if
the exchange coupling $J$ is taken very small ($J=0.1\gamma$). However, they
claim that the ultrahigh harmonics obtained in the strong $J$ limit can only be
a result of numerical bugs. It turns out that in these works, conclusions built
from numerical simulations performed in the perturbative limit
($J/\hbar\omega\approx 10$) where used to criticize results obtained in the
extremely high non-linear regime ($J/\hbar\omega>10^3$). Regarding this fact,
we find it necessary to shed light on many aspects related to the physics
behind the predicted unconventional carrier pumping, in order to enlighten the
readers of the proposed effect and at the same time the authors of the
criticizing works. Here, we present numerical simulations of the scaling laws
underlying the effect. We study the low s-d exchange coupling limit,
corresponding to the regime studied in the above mentioned criticizing works.
And further explore, the high s-d coupling regime where the extremely nonlinear
emission is expected. Furthermore, we provide more insights on the effect and
demonstrate its robustness and reproducibility in both 1D and 2D magnetic
structures.

Recent experiments on non-magnetic Weyl semimetals have seen separate bulk
and surface superconductivity in Weyl semimetals, which raises the question of
whether the surface Fermi arcs can support intrinsic superconductivity while
the bulk stays in the normal state. A theoretical answer to this question is
hindered by the absence of a well-defined surface Hamiltonian since the Fermi
arcs merge with the bulk states at their endpoints. Using an alternate, Green's
functions-based approach on a phenomenological model that can yield arbitrary
Fermi arcs, we show -- within mean-field theory -- that the surface can support
a standard Cooper instability while the bulk remains disordered. Although the
surface has lower dimensionality, a higher density of states compared to the
bulk allows it to have a higher mean-field superconducting transition
temperature.
