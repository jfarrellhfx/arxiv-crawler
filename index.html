<h3>Exploring the Surface Segregation of Rh Dopant in PtNi Nanoparticles  through Atom Probe Tomography Analysis</h3>

Proton exchange membrane fuel cells hold promise as energy conversion devices
for hydrogen-based power generation and storage. However, the slow kinetics of
the oxygen reduction at the cathode imposes the need for highly active
catalysts, typically Pt or Pt-based, with a large available area. The scarcity
of Pt increases deployment and operational cost, driving the development of
novel highly-active material systems. As an alternative, Rh-doped PtNi
nanoparticle has been suggested as promising oxygen reduction catalyst, but the
3D distributions of constituent elements in the nanoparticles have remained
unclear, making it difficult to guide property optimization. Here, a
combination of advanced microscopy and microanalysis techniques is used to
study the Rh distribution in the PtNi nanoparticles, and Rh surface segregation
is revealed, even with an overall Rh content below 2 at. %. Our findings
suggest that doping and surface chemistry must be carefully investigated to
establish a clear link with catalytic activity can truly be established.

Active, point-like, self-propelling particles - microorganisms, autophoretic
colloids, and active droplets - are known to self-organise into collective
states via inter-agent interactions. Here, we create conformationally free
extended active objects - polymers - and show that self-shaping interactions
within the polymer result in novel dissipative structures. Using experiments,
simulations and theory, we show that chemical interactions between the jointed
active droplets result in emergent rigidity, stereotypical shapes and ballistic
propulsion of the active polymers. These traits, quantified by the curvatures
and speeds of the active polymers, vary systematically with the number of
monomers comprising the chain. Using simulations of a minimal model, we
establish that the emergent properties are a generic consequence of quasi
two-dimensional confinement and chemical interactions between the freely
jointed active droplets. Our work provides insights into the emergent
organization of extended active objects due to self-shaping interaction
landscapes.

Fluid flow networks are ubiquitous and can be found in a broad range of
contexts, from human-made systems such as water supply networks to living
systems like animal and plant vasculature. In many cases, the elements forming
these networks exhibit a highly non-linear pressure-flow relationship. Although
we understand how these elements work individually, their collective behavior
remains poorly understood. In this work, we combine experiments, theory, and
numerical simulations to understand the main mechanisms underlying the
collective behavior of soft flow networks with elements that exhibit negative
differential resistance. Strikingly, our theoretical analysis and experiments
reveal that a minimal network of nonlinear resistors, which we have termed a
`fluidic memristor', displays history-dependent resistance. This new class of
element can be understood as a collection of hysteresis loops that allows this
fluidic system to store information. Our work provides insights that may inform
new applications of fluid flow networks in soft materials science, biomedical
settings, and soft robotics, and may also motivate new understanding of the
flow networks involved in animal and plant physiology.

<h3>Fluid-Glass-Jamming Rheology of Soft Active Brownian Particles</h3>

We study the shear rheology of a binary mixture of soft Active Brownian
Particles, from the fluid to the disordered solid regime. At low shear rates,
we find a Newtonian regime, where a Green-Kubo relation with an effective
temperature provides the linear viscosity. It is followed by a shear-thinning
regime at larger shear rates. A solid regime at high densities is signalled by
the emergence of a finite yield stress. We construct a "fluid-glass-jamming"
phase diagram, in which the temperature axis is replaced by activity. Although
activity, like temperature, increases the amount of fluctuations in the system,
it plays a different role, as it changes the exponent characterizing the decay
of the diffusivity close to the glass transition and the shape of the yield
stress surface. The dense disordered active solid appears to be mostly
dominated by athermal jamming rather than glass rheology.

<h3>Rapid design of fully soft deployable structures via kirigami cuts and  active learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11295" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11295</a>

Soft deployable structures - unlike conventional piecewise rigid deployables
based on hinges and springs - can assume intricate 3-D shapes, thereby enabling
transformative technologies in soft robotics, shape-morphing architecture, and
pop-up manufacturing. Their virtually infinite degrees of freedom allow precise
control over the final shape. The same enabling high dimensionality, however,
poses a challenge for solving the inverse design problem involving this class
of structures: to achieve desired 3D structures it typically requires
manufacturing technologies with extensive local actuation and control during
fabrication, and a trial and error search over a large design space. We address
both of these shortcomings by first developing a simplified planar fabrication
approach that combines two ingredients: strain mismatch between two layers of a
composite shell and kirigami cuts that relieves localized stress. In principle,
it is possible to generate targeted 3-D shapes by designing the appropriate
kirigami cuts and selecting the right amount of prestretch, thereby eliminating
the need for local control. Second, we formulate a data-driven physics-guided
framework that reduces the dimensionality of the inverse design problem using
autoencoders and efficiently searches through the ``latent" parameter space in
an active learning approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the rapid
design procedure via a range of target shapes, such as peanuts, pringles,
flowers, and pyramids. Tabletop experiments are conducted to fabricate the
target shapes. Experimental results and numerical predictions from our
framework are found to be in good agreement.

<h3>Topology of Wilson-loop spectrum and periodic evolution of surface-state  Fermi arc</h3>

Wilson-loop has been widely used to characterize the topological property of
topological insulators, high order topological insulators and topological
semimetals. Both bulk topological invariants and nontrivial boundary properties
can be deduced from the topology of Wilson-loop spectrum. However, no attempt
has been made to observe it. In this letter we demonstrate the topology of
Wilson-loop spectrum can be observed by using the existing technology for
observing surface-state Fermi arc. We predict that the surface-state Fermi arc
sweeps the whole surface Brillouin zone in a continuous periodic process and
thus generates a surface that is topologically equivalent to the Wilson-loop
spectrum. So by observing the evolution of surface-state Fermi arc in the
periodic process we can get the topology of Wilson-loop spectrum.

<h3>Ground state and spectral properties of the doped one-dimensional  optical Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10193" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10193</a>

<br>

We present a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study of the doped
one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (Hubbard-SSH) model, where
the atomic displacements linearly modulate the nearest-neighbor hopping
integrals. Focusing on an optical variant of the model in the strongly
correlated limit relevant for cuprate spin chains, we examine how the SSH
interaction modifies the model's ground and excited state properties. The SSH
coupling weakly renormalizes the model's single- and two-particle response
functions for electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling strengths below a
parameter-dependent critical value $g_\mathrm{c}$. For larger $e$-ph coupling,
the sign of the effective hopping integrals changes for a subset of orbitals,
which drives a lattice dimerization distinct from the standard nesting-driven
picture in 1D. The spectral weight of the one- and two-particle dynamical
response functions are dramatically rearranged across this transition, with
significant changes in the ground state correlations. We argue that this
dimerization results from the breakdown of the linear approximation for the
$e$-ph coupling and thus signals a fundamental limitation of the linear SSH
interaction. Our results have consequences for our understanding of how
SSH-like interactions can enter the physics of strongly correlated quantum
materials, including the recently synthesized doped cuprate spin chains.

<h3>Particle-hole symmetry protects spin-valley blockade in graphene quantum  dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
Particle-hole symmetry plays an important role for the characterization of
topological phases in solid-state systems. It is found, for example, in
free-fermion systems at half filling, and it is closely related to the notion
of antiparticles in relativistic field theories. In the low energy limit,
graphene is a prime example of a gapless particle-hole symmetric system
described by an effective Dirac equation, where topological phases can be
understood by studying ways to open a gap by preserving (or breaking)
symmetries. An important example is the intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit gap of
graphene, which leads to a lifting of the spin-valley degeneracy and renders
graphene a topological insulator in a quantum spin Hall phase, while preserving
particle-hole symmetry. Here, we show that bilayer graphene allows realizing
electron-hole double quantum-dots that exhibit nearly perfect particle-hole
symmetry, where transport occurs via the creation and annihilation of single
electron-hole pairs with opposite quantum numbers. Moreover, we show that this
particle-hole symmetry results in a protected single-particle spin-valley
blockade. The latter will allow robust spin-to-charge conversion and
valley-to-charge conversion, which is essential for the operation of spin and
valley qubits.

<h3>Pairing of Composite-Electrons and Composite-Holes in $ν_T=1$ Quantum  Hall Bilayers</h3>

<br>
<i>Luca Rüegg, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experimental indications of preformed electron-hole pairs
in $\nu_T=1$ quantum Hall bilayers at relatively large separation, we formulate
a Chern-Simons (CS) theory of the coupled composite electron liquid (CEL) and
composite hole liquid (CHL). We show that the effective action of the CS gauge
field fluctuations around the saddle-point leads to stable pairing between CEL
and CHL. We find that the CEL-CHL pairing theory leads to a dominant $s$-wave
channel in contrast to the dominant $p$-wave channel found in the CEL-CEL
pairing theory. Moreover, the CEL-CHL pairing is generally stronger than the
CEL-CEL pairing across the whole frequency spectrum. Finally, we discuss
possible differences between the two pairing mechanisms that may be probed in
experiments.

<h3>Late-time universal distribution functions of observables in  one-dimensional many-body quantum systems</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the probability distribution function of the long-time values of
observables being time-evolved by Hamiltonians modeling clean and disordered
one-dimensional chains of many spin-1/2 particles. In particular we analyze the
return probability and its version for a completely extended initial state, the
so-called spectral form factor. We complement our analysis with the spin
autocorrelation and connected spin-spin correlation functions, both of interest
in experiments with quantum simulators. We show that the distribution function
has a universal shape provided the Central Limit Theorem holds. Explicitly, the
shape is exponential for the return probability and spectral form factor,
meanwhile it is Gaussian for the few-body observables. We also discuss
implications over the so-called many-body localization. Remarkably, our
approach requires only a single sample of the dynamics, which is quite
advantageous for experiments and theory.

<h3>Observation of a Prethermal $U(1)$ Discrete Time Crystal</h3>

A time crystal is a state of periodically driven matter which breaks discrete
time translation symmetry. Time crystals have been demonstrated experimentally
in various programmable quantum simulators and exemplify how non-equilibrium,
driven quantum systems can exhibit intriguing and robust properties absent in
systems at equilibrium. These robust driven states need to be stabilized by
some mechanism, with the preeminent candidates being many-body localization and
prethermalization. This introduces additional constraints that make it
challenging to experimentally observe time crystallinity in naturally occurring
systems. Recent theoretical work has developed the notion of prethermalization
\textit{without temperature}, expanding the class of time crystal systems to
explain time crystalline observations at (or near) infinite temperature. In
this work, we conclusively observe the emergence of a prethermal $U(1)$ time
crystalline state at quasi-infinite temperature in a solid-state NMR quantum
emulator by verifying the requisites of prethermalization without temperature.
In addition to observing the signature period-doubling behavior, we show the
existence of a long-lived prethermal regime whose lifetime is significantly
enhanced by strengthening an emergent $U(1)$ conservation law. Not only do we
measure this enhancement through the global magnetization, but we also exploit
on-site disorder to measure local observables, ruling out the possibility of
many-body localization and confirming the emergence of long-range correlations.

With an increasing number of new scientific papers being released, it becomes
harder for researchers to be aware of recent articles in their field of study.
Accurately classifying papers is a first step in the direction of personalized
catering and easy access to research of interest. The field of Density
Functional Theory (DFT) in particular is a good example of a methodology used
in very different studies, and interconnected disciplines, which has a very
strong community publishing many research articles. We devise a new
unsupervised method for classifying publications, based on topic modeling, and
use a DFT-related selection of documents as a use case. We first create topics
from word analysis and clustering of the abstracts from the publications, then
attribute each publication/paper to a topic based on word similarity. We then
make interesting observations by analyzing connections between the topics and
publishers, journals, country or year of publication. The proposed approach is
general, and can be applied to analyze publication and citation trends in other
areas of study, beyond the field of Density Function Theory.

Magnetic order in most materials occurs when magnetic ions with finite
moments in a crystalline lattice arrange in a particular pattern below the
ordering temperature determined by exchange interactions between the ions.
However, when the crystal electric field (CEF) effect results in a spin-singlet
ground state on individual magnetic sites, the collective ground state of the
system can either remain non-magnetic, or more intriguingly, the exchange
interactions between neighboring ions, provided they are sufficiently strong,
can admix the excited CEF levels, resulting in a magnetically ordered ground
state. The collective magnetic excitations in such a state are so-called spin
excitons that describe the CEF transitions propagating through the lattice. In
most cases, spin excitons originating from CEF levels of a localized single ion
are dispersion-less in momentum (reciprocal) space and well-defined in both the
magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states. Here we use thermodynamic and
neutron scattering experiments to study stoichiometric Ni2Mo3O8 without site
disorder, where Ni2+ ions form a bipartite honeycomb lattice comprised of two
triangular lattices, with ions subject to the tetrahedral and octahedral
crystalline environment, respectively. We find that in both types of ions, the
CEF excitations have nonmagnetic singlet ground states, yet the material has
long-range magnetic order. Furthermore, CEF spin excitons from the
triangular-lattice arrangement of tetrahedral sites form, in both the
antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, a dispersive diffusive pattern
around the Brillouin zone boundary in reciprocal space. The present work thus
demonstrates that spin excitons in an ideal triangular lattice magnet can have
dispersive excitations, irrespective of the existence of static magnetic order,
and this phenomenon is most likely due to spin entanglement and geometric
frustrations.

<h3>Chemical reactions between carbon atoms confined in single-walled carbon  nanotube -- a molecular dynamics study</h3>

Carbon nanotubes can serve as one-dimensional nanoreactors for in-tube
synthesis of various nanostructures. Experimental observations have shown that
chains, inner tubes or nanoribbons can grow by thermal decomposition of
organic/organometallic molecules encapsulated in carbon nanotubes. The result
of the process depends on the temperature, the diameter of the nanotube, and
the type and amount of material introduced inside the tube. Nanoribbons are
particularly promising materials for nanoelectronics. Motivated by recent
experimental results observing the formation of carbon nanoribbons inside
carbon nanotubes, molecular dynamics calculations were performed with the open
source LAMMPS code to investigate the reactions between carbon atoms confined
within a single walled carbon nanotube. Our results show that the interatomic
potentials behave differently in quasi-one-dimensional simulations of
nanotube-confined space than in three-dimensional simulations. In particular,
the Tersoff potential performs better than the widely used ReaxFF potential, in
describing the formation of carbon nanoribbons inside nanotubes. The Tersoff
potential is a valuable tool for modelling reactions within the nanotubes. We
also found a temperature window where the nanoribbons were formed with the
fewest defects, i.e. with the largest flatness and the most hexagons, which is
in agreement with the experimental temperature range.

Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures combining layered ferromagnets and other
two-dimensional (2D) crystals are promising building blocks for the realization
of ultra-compact devices with integrated magnetic, electronic and optical
functionalities. Their implementation in various technologies depends strongly
on the development of a bottom-up scalable synthesis approach allowing to
realize highly uniform heterostructures with well-defined interfaces between
different 2D layered materials. It also requires that each material component
of the heterostructure remains functional, which ideally includes ferromagnetic
order above room temperature for 2D ferromagnets. Here, we demonstrate
large-area growth of Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_{2}$/graphene heterostructures achieved by
vdW epitaxy of Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_{2}$ on epitaxial graphene. Structural
characterization confirmed the realization of a continuous vdW heterostructure
film with a sharp interface between Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_{2}$ and graphene. Magnetic
and transport studies revealed that the ferromagnetic order persists well above
300 K with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. In addition, epitaxial graphene
on SiC(0001) continues to exhibit a high electronic quality. These results
represent an important advance beyond non-scalable flake exfoliation and
stacking methods, thus marking a crucial step toward the implementation of
ferromagnetic 2D materials in practical applications.

Photonic crystals (PhCs) have emerged as a popular platform for realizing
various topological phases due to their flexibility and potential for device
applications. In this article, we present a comprehensive classification of
topological bands in one- and two dimensional photonic crystals, with and
without time-reversal symmetry. Our approach exploits the symmetry
representations of field eigenmodes at high-symmetry points in momentum space,
allowing for the efficient design of a wide range of topological PhCs. In
particular, we show that the complete classification provided here is useful
for diagnosing photonic crystal analogs of obstructed atomic limits, fragile
phases, and stable topological phases that include bands with Dirac points and
Chern numbers.

Kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs, Rb) provide a rich platform for intertwined
orders, where evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking, likely due to the
long-sought loop currents, has emerged in STM and muon spin relaxation
experiments. An isotropic component in the spontaneous optical rotation has
also been reported, and it was interpreted as the magneto-optic Kerr effect
arising from time-reversal symmetry breaking. Intriguingly, the observed
rotations differ by five orders of magnitude between different wavelengths and
samples, suggesting more intricate physics. Here we report optical rotation and
polar Kerr measurements in CsV3Sb5 crystals at the same wavelength. We observe
large isotropic components of 1 milliradian in the optical rotation that do not
respond to applied magnetic fields but flip sign between samples, while the
spontaneous Kerr signal is less than 20 nanoradian. Our results prove
unambiguously that the reported isotropic rotation is not related to
time-reversal symmetry breaking but instead indicates a new intertwined order
that onsets at the same temperature.

Thermal shock resistance is one of the performance-defining properties for
applications where extreme temperature gradients are required. The thermal
shock resistance of a material can be described by means of the thermal shock
parameter RT. Here, the thermo-mechanical properties required for RT
calculation are quantum-mechanically predicted and experimentally determined
and compared for Ti3AlC2 and Cr2AlC MAX phases. The coatings are synthesized
utilizing direct-current magnetron sputtering without additional heating,
followed by vacuum annealing. It is shown that the RT of Ti3AlC2 obtained via
simulations is in good agreement with the experimentally obtained one. However,
for Cr2AlC, the theoretical predictions result in an almost three times larger
RT vs. the experimentally deduced value, primarily caused by neglecting
spin-polarization in the calculation of the electron-phonon scattering time as
a component of the thermal conductivity. Comparing the MAX phase coatings, both
experiments and simulations indicate superior thermal shock behavior of Ti3AlC2
compared to Cr2AlC.

<h3>Quasiperiodicity in the $α-$Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system  revisited: an approach using ideas from wave turbulence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10297" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10297</a>

The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) problem addresses fundamental questions
in statistical physics, and attempts to understand the origin of recurrences in
the system have led to many great advances in nonlinear dynamics and
mathematical physics. In this work we revisit the problem and study the cause
of quasiperiodic recurrences in the weakly nonlinear $\alpha-$FPUT system. Our
aim is to understand if the FPUT recurrences that are observed in the original
paper can be captured by the wave turbulence formalism, which is expected only
if we are in the weakly nonlinear regime. In our work we show that this is not
always the case and in particular, the recurrences observed in the original
paper are not captured by the wave turbulence formalism. We attribute this
disagreement to the presence of small denominators in the canonical
transformation used to remove the three wave interactions before arriving at
the starting point of wave turbulence. We also show that these small
denominators are present even in the weakly nonlinear regime, and they become
more significant as the system size is increased. We provide numerical evidence
to support our claim. We also discuss our results in the context of the problem
of equilibration in the $\alpha-$FPUT system, and argue that the wave
turbulence formalism needs to be modified for the $\alpha-$FPUT chain in order
to explain quasiperiodicity and thermalization in the system for a wider range
of nonlinearities, and for larger system sizes.

Jammed packings of granular materials display complex mechanical response.
For example, the ensemble-averaged shear modulus $\left\langle G \right\rangle$
increases as a power-law in pressure $p$ for static packings of spherical
particles that can rearrange during compression. We seek to design granular
materials with shear moduli that can either increase {\it or} decrease with
pressure without particle rearrangements even in the large-system limit. To do
this, we construct {\it tessellated} granular metamaterials by joining multiple
particle-filled cells together. We focus on cells that contain a small number
of bidisperse disks in two dimensions. We first study the mechanical properties
of individual disk-filled cells with three types of boundaries: periodic
boundary conditions, fixed-length walls, and flexible walls. Hypostatic jammed
packings are found for disk-filled cells with flexible walls, but not in cells
with periodic boundary conditions and fixed-length walls, and they are
stabilized by quartic modes of the dynamical matrix. The shear modulus of a
single cell depends linearly on $p$. We find that the slope of the shear
modulus with pressure, $\lambda_c < 0$ for all packings in single cells with
periodic boundary conditions where the number of particles per cell $N \ge 6$.
In contrast, single cells with fixed-length and flexible walls can possess
$\lambda_c > 0$, as well as $\lambda_c < 0$, for $N \le 16$. We show that we
can force the mechanical properties of multi-cell granular metamaterials to
possess those of single cells by constraining the endpoints of the outer walls
and enforcing an affine shear response. These studies demonstrate that
tessellated granular metamaterials provide a novel platform for the design of
soft materials with novel mechanical properties.

We propose a new scheme to implement the self-consistent optimization of the
trial wave-function in constrained path auxiliary field Quantum Monte Carlo
(CP-AFQMC) in the framewok of natural orbitals. In this scheme, a new trial
wave-function in the form of Slater determinant is constructed from the
CP-AFQMC results by diagonalizing the mixed estimator of the one-body reduced
density matrix. We compare two ways (from real and mixed estimators in
CP-AFQMC) to calculate the one-body reduced density matrix in the
self-consistent process and study the ground state of doped two dimensional
Hubbard model to test the accuracy of the two schemes. By comparing the local
density, occupancy, and ground state energy we find the scheme in which
one-body reduced density matrix is calculated from mixed estimator is
computational more efficient and provides more accurate result with less
fluctuation. The local densities from mixed estimator scheme agree well with
the numerically exact values. This scheme provides a useful tool for the study
of strongly correlated electron systems.

Macroscopic assemblies of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are desirable materials
because of the excellent CNT properties. Amongst the methods of production of
these CNT materials, the dry-draw fabrication where CNT fibers (CNTFs) are
directly pulled out from a CNT forest is known to provide good physical
properties. Although it is known that vertical alignment of CNT bundles within
the CNT forest is important, the mechanisms behind the dry-draw fabrication of
CNTFs are still not completely understood. The simplest known dry-draw model
consists of CNT bundles laterally interacting by only van der Waals forces
(vdWf). Here, by fully atomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations, we
show that the simplest dry-draw model does not produce CNTFs. We also show one
important condition for a pair of adjacent CNT bundles to connect themselves
under vdWf only and discuss why it leads to the failure of the simplest model.

<br>
<br>
In order to reveal the coupling effect among the chemical activity and the
hydraulic seepage as well as the mechanical properties, a constitutive
theoretical framework considering the chemical activity for saturated porous
media is derived from the mixture theory incorporated with the chemical
thermodynamics. First, to highlight the important role of porosity in the
hydro-mechanical-chemical multi-field coupling mechanism, the solid strain is
divided into the porosity-dependent skeleton strain, the matrix strain and the
mass-exchange strain. The stress and strain state variables are determined from
the energy-conjugated form of the energy balance equation for establishing
constitutive equations. Second, under infinitesimal case, general elastic
constitutive equations including the relationship between mass fraction and its
chemical potential are expressed by the free energy potential. Plastic model
and the constitutive equation of thermodynamic flux and force are derived from
the dissipative potential. Finally, under the guide of this theoretical
framework, the complete swelling constitutive models in the confined
compression are established for bentonite. The corresponding governing
equations are formulated for multi-field two-phase saturated porous media.
Compared with the experimental data, the proposed model can well reflect the
chemical and mechanic coupling characteristics of representative elementary
volume in the different NaCl concentrations of solution for saturated
bentonite.

Surface reconstruction plays a vital role in determining the surface
electronic structure and chemistry of semiconductors and metal oxides. However,
it has been commonly believed that surface reconstruction does not occur in van
der Waals layered materials, as they do not undergo significant bond breaking
during surface formation. In this study, we present evidence that charge
density wave (CDW) order in these materials can, in fact, cause CDW surface
reconstruction through interlayer coupling. Using density functional theory
calculations on the 1T-TaS2 surface, we reveal that CDW reconstruction,
involving collective and modest atomic displacements in the subsurface layer,
results in a significant modification of the surface electronic structure,
transforming it from a Mott insulator to a band insulator. This new form of
surface reconstruction explains several previously unexplained observations on
the 1T-TaS2 surface and has important implications for interpreting surface
phenomena in CDW-ordered layered materials.

In this paper, we investigate the low temperature magnetic properties of the
rare-earth garnet compound Nd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ in detail by means of
magnetization, specific heat and magnetocaloric effect measurements. The
magnetic thermal properties along with the crystal field calculations reveal
that the Nd$^{3+}$ ions form into a frustrated hyper-kagome lattice with
connected triangles have an Ising-like ground state with the easy axis along
the local [100], [010] and [001] directions. Instead of a quantum spin liquid
ground state, an antiferromagnetically ordered state is found below
$T_{\mathrm{N}}=0.52~\rm K$. With applying field in the [111] direction, the
antiferromagnetic order is suppressed at the critical field of
$B_{\mathrm{c}}=0.75~\rm T$, and enhancement of the critical fluctuations with
linear crossover behaviors is observed near the critical point.

Higher-order topological phases have raised widespread interest in recent
years with the occurrence of the topological boundary states of dimension two
or more less than that of the system bulk. The higher-order topological states
have been verified in gapped phases, in a wide variety of systems, such as
photonic and acoustic systems, and recently also observed in gapless semimetal
phase, such as Weyl and Dirac phases, in systems alike. The higher-order
topology is signaled by the hinge states emerging in the common bandgaps of the
bulk states and the surface states. In this Letter, we report our first
prediction and observation of a new type of hinge states, the bound hinge
states in the continuum (BHICs) bulk band, in a higher-order Weyl semimetal
implemented in phononic crystal. In contrast to the hinge state in gap, which
is characterized by the bulk polarization, the BHIC is identified by the
nontrivial surface polarization. The finding of the topological BHICs broadens
our insight to the topological states, and may stimulate similar researches in
other systems such as electronic, photonic, and cold atoms systems. Our work
may pave the way toward high-Q acoustic devices in application.

The site percolation problem is one of the core topics in statistical
physics. Evaluation of the percolation threshold, which separates two phases
(sometimes described as conducting and isolating), is useful for a lot of
problems ranging from core condensed matter to interdisciplinary application of
statistical physics in epidemiology or any other transportation or connectivity
problems. In this paper -- with Newman--Ziff fast Monte Carlo algorithm and
finite-size scaling theory -- we compute the random site percolation thresholds
$p_c$ for a square lattice with complex neighborhoods containing sites from the
sixth coordination zone. Complex neighborhoods are those that contain sites
from various coordination zones (which are not necessarily compact ones). We
present the source codes of the appropriate procedures (written in C) and the
results of their usage in computations of the percolation threshold on the
square lattice for neighborhoods containing sites up to the sixth coordination
zone. We conclude that similarly to the honeycomb lattice, the percolation
thresholds for complex neighborhoods on a square lattice follow the power law
$p_c(\zeta)\propto\zeta^{-\gamma_2}$ with $\gamma_2=0.5454(60)$, where
$\zeta=\sum_i z_i r_i$ is the weighted distance of sites in complex
neighborhoods ($r_i$ and $z_i$ are the distance from the central site and the
number of sites in the coordination zone $i$, respectively).

We consider a free-fermion chain with a conformal defect that features an
extended zero mode, and study the entanglement properties in its mixed ground
state. The zero-mode induced degeneracy modifies the density of states in the
single-particle entanglement spectrum, which can be calculated via the full
counting statistics. For a homogeneous chain, the resulting change in the
R\'enyi entropy is derived analytically for arbitrary subsystem ratios in the
thermodynamic limit. For a conformal defect located in the center, analogous
results can be obtained for the half-chain entanglement. In particular, we
observe parity effects for half-chains with even/odd sites, which do not decay
with size.

Antiferromagnetic (AF) spintronics is merit on ultra-high operator speed and
stability in the presence of magnetic field. To fully use the merit, the device
should be pure rather than hybrid with ferromagnet or ferrimagnet. For the
magnetism in the antiferromagnet is canceled by that of different sublattices,
breaking the symmetry in the material can revive the native magnetism, which
can be detected by the magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Achieving noticeable MR
effect in the pure AF device is diffcult but essential for the AF spintronic
applications. Here, we study the tunnel magnetoresistance(TMR) effect in the
Nb/Mn2Au/CdO/Mn2Au/Nb pure AF magnetic tunnel junctions (AF-MTJs) based on a
first-principle scattering theory. Giant TMRs with order of 1000% are predicted
in some symmetric junctions, which is originated from the interfacial resonance
tunneling effect related with the k dependent complex band structures of CdO
and Mn2Au in companion with the enhanced spin polarization of the interfacial
magnetic atoms. The effect of voltage bias and interfacial disorder such as
Oxygen vacancy, Manganese vacancy, and Manganese-Cadmium exchanges at Mn2Au/CdO
interfaces are studied also. Our studies suggest Nb/Mn2Au/CdO/Mn2Au/Nb AFMTJs
promising material for AF spintronic application, and rocksalt CdO a potential
symmetry filtering material for spintronic applications.

Spin waves that can propagate in normal and superconducting metals are
investigated. Unlike normal metals, the velocity of spin waves becomes

within the narrow region below the superconducting transition temperature. At
low temperatures the high frequency waves alone can propagate with an
additional damping due to pair-breaking.

We study a cast Mg-4.65Al-2.82Ca alloy with a microstructure containing
$\alpha$-Mg matrix reinforced with a C36 Laves phase skeleton. Such ternary
alloys are targeted for elevated temperature applications in automotive engines
since they possess excellent creep properties. However, in application, the
alloy may be subjected to a wide range of strain rates and in material
development, accelerated testing is often of essence. It is therefore crucial
to understand the effect of such rate variations. Here, we focus on their
impact on damage formation. Due to the locally highly variable skeleton forming
the reinforcement in this alloy, we employ an analysis based on high resolution
panoramic imaging by scanning electron microscopy coupled with automated damage
analysis by deep learning-based object detection and classification
convolutional neural network algorithm (YOLOV5). We find that with decreasing
strain rate the dominant damage mechanism for a given strain level changes: at
a strain rate of $5\cdot10^{-4}/s$ the evolution of microcracks in the C36
Laves phase governs damage formation. However , when the strain rate is
decreased to $5\cdot10^{-6}/s$, interface decohesion at the $\alpha$-Mg/Laves
phase interfaces becomes equally important. We also observe a change in crack
orientation indicating an increasing influence of plastic co-deformation of the
{\alpha}-Mg matrix and Laves phase. We attribute this transition in leading
damage mechanism to thermally activated processes at the interface.

<h3>Encounter-based reaction-subdiffusion model I: surface adsorption and  the local time propagator</h3>

<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we develop an encounter-based model of partial surface
adsorption for fractional diffusion in a bounded domain. We take the
probability of adsorption to depend on the amount of particle-surface contact
time, as specified by a Brownian functional known as the boundary local time
$\ell(t)$. If the rate of adsorption is state dependent, then the adsorption
process is non-Markovian, reflecting the fact that surface
activation/deactivation proceeds progressively by repeated particle encounters.
The generalized adsorption event is identified as the first time that the local
time crosses a randomly generated threshold. Different models of adsorption
(Markovian and non-Markovian) then correspond to different choices for the
random threshold probability density $\psi(\ell)$. The marginal probability
density for particle position $\X(t)$ prior to absorption depends on $\psi$ and
the joint probability density for the pair $(\X(t),\ell(t))$, also known as the
local time propagator. In the case of normal diffusion one can use a
Feynman-Kac formula to derive an evolution equation for the propagator. Here we
derive the local time propagator equation for fractional diffusion by taking a
continuum limit of a heavy-tailed continuous-time random walk (CTRW). We use
our encounter-based model to investigate the effects of subdiffusion and
non-Markovian adsorption on the long-time behavior of the first passage time
(FPT) density in a finite interval $[0,L]$ with a reflecting boundary at $x=L$.
In particular, we determine how the choice of function $\psi$ affects the
large-$t$ power law decay of the FPT density. Finally, we indicate how to
extend the model to higher spatial dimensions.

<h3>Encounter-based reaction-subdiffusion model II: partially absorbing  traps and the occupation time propagator</h3>

<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we develop an encounter-based model of reaction-subdiffusion in
a domain $\Omega$ with a partially absorbing interior trap $\calU\subset
\Omega$. We assume that the particle can freely enter and exit $\calU$, but is
only absorbed within $\calU$. We take the probability of absorption to depend
on the amount of time a particle spends within the trap, which is specified by
a Brownian functional known as the occupation time $A(t)$. The first passage
time (FPT) for absorption is identified with the point at which the occupation
time crosses a random threshold $\widehat{A}$ with probability density
$\psi(a)$. Non-Markovian models of absorption can then be incorporated by
taking $\psi(a)$ to be non-exponential. The marginal probability density for
particle position $\X(t)$ prior to absorption depends on $\psi$ and the joint
probability density for the pair $(\X(t),A(t))$, also known as the occupation
time propagator. In the case of normal diffusion one can use a Feynman-Kac
formula to derive an evolution equation for the propagator. However, care must
be taken when combining fractional diffusion with chemical reactions in the
same medium. Therefore, we derive the occupation time propagator equation from
first principles by taking the continuum limit of a heavy-tailed CTRW. We then
use the solution of the propagator equation to investigate conditions under
which the mean FPT (MFPT) for absorption within a trap is finite. We show that
this depends on the choice of threshold density $\psi(a)$ and the
subdiffusivity. Hence, as previously found for evanescent reaction-subdiffusion
models, the processes of subdiffusion and absorption are intermingled.

Diffusion in heterogeneous media partitioned by semi-permeable interfaces has
a wide range of applications in the physical and life sciences, including gas
permeation in soils, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), drug
delivery, thermal conduction in composite media, synaptic receptor trafficking,
and intercellular gap junctions. At the single particle level, diffusion across
a semi-permeable interface can be formulated in terms of so-called snapping out
Brownian motion (SNOBM). The latter sews together successive rounds of
reflected BM, each of which is restricted to one side of the interface. Each
round of reflected BM is killed when the local time at the interface exceeds an
independent, exponentially distributed random variable. (The local time
specifies the amount of time a reflected Brownian particle spends in a
neighborhood of the interface.) The particle then immediately resumes reflected
BM on the same side or the other side of the interface according to a
stochastic switch, and the process is iterated. In this paper, we develop a
Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating a two-dimensional version of SNOBM, which
is used to solve a first passage time (FPT) problem for diffusion in a domain
with semi-permeable partially absorbing traps. Our method combines a
walk-on-spheres (WOS) method with an efficient algorithm for computing the
boundary local time that uses a Skorokhod integral representation of the
latter. We validate our algorithm by comparing the Monte Carlo estimates of the
MFPT to the exact solution for a single circular trap, and show that our
simulations are consistent with asymptotic results obtained for the 2D narrow
capture problem involving multiple small circular targets. We also discuss
extensions to higher dimensions.

Plastic inhomogeneity, particularly localised strain, is one of the main
mechanisms responsible for failures in engineering alloys. This work studied
the spatial arrangement and distribution of microstructure and their influence
in the plastic inhomogeneity of Inconel 718 fabricated by additive
manufacturing (AM). In particular, the density and spatial distribution of
geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and the crystallographic texture
components were examined in relation to the spatial plastic deformation.
In-situ tensile testing coupled with microscopy and EBSD was performed to
understand the evolution of the as-built microstructure and its effect on the
spatial and temporal deformation behaviour. Bidirectional scan strategy with no
interlayer rotation resulted in highly ordered alternating arrangements of
coarse Goss-like {110}<001> textured grains separated by fine Cube-like
{100}<001> textured grains. This strategy also resulted in an overall high
density of dislocations (in particular GNDs) with a regular pattern: the fine
grains contained very high GND density while the coarse grains contained less
GNDs but they were oriented to be perpendicular to the scan direction. Although
this strategy resulted in a dominant Cube texture that is desirable for
isotropy, the Cube texture gradually weakened and the undesirable Goss
component increased during plastic deformation. Together with the columnar
grain morphology and aligned GND arrangement, such texture evolution caused
intense plastic inhomogeneity during deformation. Replacing the bidirectional
strategy with a chessboard strategy involving a 67{\deg} layer rotation
resulted in a lower GND density and much more random distribution of
crystallographic texture and GNDs, with a dominant Cube component (and lower
Goss texture) that remained stable throughout plastic deformation, reducing the
plastic inhomogeneity.

The Josephson junction (JJ) is an essential element of superconducting (SC)
devices for both fundamental and applied physics. The short-range coherent
coupling of two adjacent JJs forms the Andreev molecule states (AMSs), which
will provide a new ingredient to engineer the SC transport in JJs and control
the Andreev qubits. However, no experimental evidence of the AMSs in the
coupled JJs has been reported. Here we provide the tunnel spectroscopic results
of electrically controllable two planar JJs sharing one SC electrode. We
discover that the coupled JJ results are highly modulated from the single JJ
results, due to formation of the phase-dependent AMSs, meaning that the two JJs
are coherently coupled. In addition, the superconducting gap closing due to the
AMS formation is observed. Our results would help in understanding the
microscopic mechanism of the coherent coupling and promoting the AMS physics to
apply for research of the topological superconductivity and quantum information
technology.

The rare-earth perovskite TbScO$_3$ has been widely used as a substrate for
the growth of epitaxial ferroelectric and multiferroic thin films, while its
detailed low-temperature magnetic properties were rarely reported. In this
paper, we performed detailed magnetization, specific heat and single crystal
neutron scattering measurements, along with the crystalline electric field
calculations to study the low-temperature magnetic properties of TbScO$_3$. All
our results suggest the magnetic Tb$^{3+}$ has an Ising-like pseudo-doublet
ground state at low temperatures. Due to the constrain of local point symmetry,
these Tb$^{3+}$ Ising moments are confined in the $ab$ plane with a tilt angle
of $\varphi = \pm48^{\mathrm{o}}$ to the $a$ axis. In zero field, the system
undergoes an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_{\mathrm{N}}=2.53$ K, and
forms a $G_xA_y$ noncollinear magnetic structure below $T_{\mathrm{N}}$. We
find the dipole-dipole interactions play an important role to determine the
magnetic ground state, which are also responsible for the quasi-one-dimensional
magnetism in TbScO$_3$. The significant anisotropic diffuse scatterings further
confirm the quasi-one-dimensional magnetism along the $c$ axis. The magnetic
phase diagram with the field along the easy $b$ axis is well established. In
addition to the $G_xA_y$ antiferromagnetic state, there is an exotic
field-induced phase emerged near the critical field $B_{\mathrm{c}}\simeq0.7$
T, where three-dimensional magnetic order is suppressed but strong
one-dimensional correlations may still exist.

We report a detailed study of the magnetic properties of KBaGd(BO$_3$)$_2$,
in which magnetic Gd$^{3+}$ ($S=7/2$) ions form into two-dimensional triangular
layers. Magnetization, specific heat and magnetocaloric effect (MCE)
measurements have been performed on KBaGd(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals. The
results show that a long-range antiferromagnetic state is established below
$T_{\rm N}=0.24$ K. In zero fields, only about half of the full entropy is
released at $T_{\rm N}$, indicating that not all the magnetic moments are
frozen below the ordering temperature, as expected from the geometrical
frustration of the triangular spin lattice. Further studies under external
fields were performed down to 50 mK, and the magnetic phase diagrams are
established with magnetic fields applied both within and perpendicular to the
triangular plane. KBaGd(BO$_3$)$_2$ serves as an example of a two-dimensional
triangular lattice with large spin values ($S=7/2$) and can be directly
compared with the iso-structure KBaR(BO$_3$)$_2$ (R = Dy-Yb) family of doublet
ground states, which exhibit effective spins of $S=1/2$.

The dynamical properties of nuclei, carried by the concept of phonon
quasiparticles, are central to the field of condensed matter. While the
harmonic approximation can reproduce a number of properties observed in real
crystals, the inclusion of anharmonicity in lattice dynamics is essential to
accurately predict properties such as heat transport or thermal expansion. For
highly anharmonic systems, non perturbative approaches are needed, which result
in renormalized theories of lattice dynamics. In this article, we apply the
Mori-Zwanzig projector formalism to derive an exact generalized Langevin
equation describing the quantum dynamics of nuclei in a crystal. By projecting
this equation on quasiparticles in reciprocal space, and with results from
linear response theory, we obtain a formulation of vibrational spectra that
fully accounts for the anharmonicity. Using a mode-coupling approach, we
construct a systematic perturbative expansion in which each new order is built
to minimize the following ones. With a truncation to the lowest order, we show
how to obtain a set of self-consistent equations that can describe the
lineshapes of quasiparticles. The only inputs needed for the resulting set of
equations are the static Kubo correlation functions, which can be computed
using path-integral molecular dynamics or approximated with (classical or ab
initio) molecular dynamics.

Recently, the in-plane thermal transport in van der Waals (vdW) materials
such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been widely studied. Whereas, the cross-plane one is
far from sufficient. Based on the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations and Boltzmann transport equation, here we reveal the stacking and
thickness effects on the cross-plane thermal conductivity (K) of h-BN. We find
that K can be significantly modulated by both the stacking structure and
thickness (d) of h-BN, which is unexpected from the viewpoint of its smooth
in-plane structure and weak interlayer interaction. In the small thickness
region (d<6 nm), K of h-BN at room temperature significantly increases with
thickness, following a power law of K ~ d^b with b=0.84, 0.66, and 0.92 for
AA', AB, and AB' stacking structures, respectively. Moreover, K of AB'
structure reaches up to 60% larger than that of AA' and AB structures with
d=5.3 nm, showing the remarkable stacking effect. We also find that the
stacking effect on K changes dramatically with d increasing, where AA' stacking
has the largest K with d > 200 nm. We finally clarify that such exotic stacking
and thickness dependence of K is owing to the competing effect of excited
number of phonons and phonon relaxation time, both of which directly affect the
thermal conductivity. Our findings may provide new insights into the
cross-plane thermal management in vdW materials.

We present a comprehensive investigation of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in ultrathin strongly
disordered NbN films. Measurements of resistance, current-voltage
characteristics and kinetic inductance on the very same device reveal a
consistent picture of a sharp unbinding transition of vortex-antivortex pairs
that fit standard renormalization group theory without extra assumptions in
terms of inhomogeneity. Our experiments demonstrate that the previously
observed broadening of the transition is not an intrinsic feature of strongly
disordered superconductors and provide a clean starting point for the study of
dynamical effects at the BKT transition.

Using Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study spin-1/2 diagonal ladders
coupled by ferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions. The model can also be viewed
as usual ladders with ferromagnetic rung couplings coupled by antiferromagnetic
diagonal couplings. We find that the model hosts a striped magnetic ordered
phase and two topological nontrivial Haldane phases, separated by two quantum
critical points. We show that the two quantum critical points are all in the
three-dimensional O(3) universality class irrelevant to the topological
properties of the Haldane phases. The properties of the surface formed by
ladder ends in the two Haldane phases are studied. We find that the surface
states are both gapless due to the symmetry-protected topological bulk states.
We further demonstrate that extraordinary surface critical behaviors are
realized at both critical points on such gapless surfaces without enhancing the
surface coupling. Notably, the surface is not expected to be ordered in the
three-dimensional classical O(3) critical point, suggesting that the
topological properties of the Haldane phases are responsible for such surface
critical behavior.

We investigate the crystallographic and magnetic properties of a
chromium-based thiospinel CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$. From a synchrotron x-ray
diffraction experiment and structural refinement, Cu and Ga atoms are found to
occupy the tetrahedral $A$-sites in an alternate way, yielding breathing
pyrochlore Cr network. CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ undergoes a magnetic transition
associated with a structural distortion at 31 K in zero magnetic field,
indicating that the spin-lattice coupling is responsible for relieving the
geometrical frustration. When applying a pulsed high magnetic field, a sharp
metamagnetic transition takes place at 40 T, followed by a 1/2-magnetization
plateau up to 103 T. These phase transitions accompany dielectric anomalies,
suggesting the presence of helical spin correlations in low-field phases. The
density-functional-theory calculation reveals that CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ is
dominated by antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange couplings within
small and large tetrahedra, respectively, in analogy with CuInCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$.
We argue that $A$-site-ordered Cr thiospinels serve as an excellent platform to
explore diverse magnetic phases along with pronounced magnetoelastic and
magnetodielectric responses.

The body-centered-tetragonal antiferromagnet EuGa$_4$ exhibits A-type
antiferromagnetic order below its N\'eel temperature $T_{\rm N} = 16.4$ K in
magnetic field $H = 0$ where the moments are ferromagnetically aligned in the
$ab$-plane with the Eu moments in adjacent Eu planes aligned
antiferromagnetically. Previous magnetization versus field $M_{ab}(H)$
measurements revealed that the moments exhibit a spin-reorientation transition
at a critical field $H_{c1}$ where the Eu moments become perpendicular to an
in-plane magnetic field while still remaining in the $ab$ plane. A theory for
$T=0$ K was previously presented that successfully explained the observed
low-field moment-reorientation behavior at $T = 2$ K. Here we present a theory
explaining the observed $T$ dependence of $M_{ab}(H,T<T_{\rm N})$ in the
[1,0,0] direction for $H\leq H_{\rm c1}(T)$ from 2 to 14 K arising from a
$T$-dependent anisotropy energy.

Understanding the origins of power loss in superconducting interconnects is
essential for the energy efficiency and scalability of superconducting digital
logic. At microwave frequencies, power dissipates in both the dielectrics and
superconducting wires, and these losses can be of comparable magnitude. A novel
method to accurately disentangle such losses by exploiting their frequency
dependence using a multi-mode transmission line resonator, supported by a
geometric factor concept and a 3D superconductor finite element method (FEM)
modeling, is described. Using the method we optimized a planarized fabrication
process of reciprocal quantum logic (RQL) for the interconnect loss at 4.2 K
and GHz frequencies. The interconnects are composed of niobium ($\rm Nb$)
insulated by silicon dioxide made with a tetraethyl orthosilicate precursor
($\rm TEOS-SiO_2$). Two process generations use damascene fabrication, and the
third one uses Cloisonn\'{e} fabrication. For all three, $\rm TEOS-SiO_2$
exhibits a dielectric loss tangent $\tan \delta = 0.0012 \pm 0.0001$,
independent of $\rm Nb$ wire width over $0.25 - 4 \: \mu m$. The $\rm Nb$ loss
varies with both the processing and the wire width. For damascene fabrication,
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) reveal that Nb oxide and Nb grain growth orientation
increase the loss above the Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) minimum theoretical
resistance $R _{BCS}$. For Cloisonn\'{e} fabrication, the $0.25 \: \mu m$ wide
$\rm Nb$ wires exhibit an intrinsic resistance $R_s = 13 \pm 1.4 \: \mu \Omega$
at 10 GHz, which is below $R_{BCS} \approx 17 \: \mu \Omega$. That is arguably
the lowest resistive loss reported for $\rm Nb$.

ultrafast dynamics of excitons and trions in MoSe$_2$ monolayers grown by
molecular beam epitaxy on thin films of hexagonal boron nitride. We assess
inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadenings in the transition spectral lineshape.
The impact of phonons on the homogeneous dephasing is inferred via the
temperature dependence of the dephasing. Four-wave mixing mapping, combined
with the atomic force microscopy, reveals spatial correlations between exciton
oscillator strength, inhomogeneous broadening and the sample morphology. The
quality of coherent optical response of the epitaxially grown transition metal
dichalcogenides becomes now comparable with the samples produced by mechanical
exfoliation, enabling coherent nonlinear spectroscopy of innovative materials,
like magnetic layers or Janus semiconductors.

A time-resolved synchrotron X-ray total scattering study sheds light on the
evolution of the different structural length scales involved during the
intercalation of the layered iron-selenide host by organic molecular donors,
aiming at the formation of the expanded lattice $Li_x(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$
hybrid superconductor. The intercalates are found to crystallize in the
tetragonal $ThCr_2Si_2$-type structure at the average level, however, with an
enhanced interlayer iron-selenide spacing (d= 16.2 \r{A}) that accommodates the
heterocyclic molecular spacers. Quantitative atomic pair distribution function
(PDF) analysis at variable times, suggests distorted $FeSe_4$ tetrahedral local
environments that appear swollen with respect to those in the parent
$\beta$-FeSe. Simultaneously acquired, in-situ synchrotron X-ray powder
diffraction data disclose that secondary phases ($\alpha$-Fe and $Li_2Se$),
grow significantly when higher Li-concentration is used in the solvothermal
reaction or when the solution is aged. These observations are in line with the
strongly reducing character of the intercalation medium's solvated electrons
that mediate the defect chemistry of the expanded lattice superconductor. In
the latter, intralayer correlated local distortions indicate electron donating
aspects that reflect in somewhat enlarged Fe-Se bonds. They also reveal a
degree of relief of chemical pressure associated with a large distance between
Fe and Se sheets ('taller' anion height) and a stretched Fe-Fe square planar
topology. The elongation of the latter, derived from the in-situ PDF study,
speaks for a plausible increase in the Fe-site vacancy concentration. The
evolution of the local structural parameters suggests an optimum reaction
window where kinetically stabilized phases resemble the distortions of the
edge-sharing Fe-Se tetrahedra, required for high-$T_c$ in expanded lattice
iron-chalcogenides.

Two-dimensional iron-chalcogenide intercalates display a remarkable
correlation of the interlayer spacing with the enhancement of the
superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$). In this work, synchrotron x-ray
absorption ($XAS$, at Fe and Se K edges) and emission ($XES$) spectroscopies,
allow to discuss how the important rise of $T_c$ (44 K) in the molecule
intercalated $\rm Li_x(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ relates to the electronic and
local structure changes felt by the inorganic host upon doping ($x$). $XES$
shows that widely-separated layers of edge-sharing $\rm FeSe_4$ tetrahedra,
carry low-spin moieties with a local Fe magnetic moment slightly reduced
compared to the parent $\beta$-$\rm Fe_{2-z}Se_2$. Pre-edge $XAS$ advises on
the progressively reduced mixing of metal $3d-4p$ states upon lithiation.
Doping-mediated local lattice modifications, probed by conventional
$T_c$-optimization measures (cf. anion height and $FeSe_4$ tetrahedra
regularity), become less relevant when layers are spaced far away. On the basis
of extended x-ray absorption fine structure, such distortions are compensated
by a softer Fe-network that relates to Fe-site vacancies, alleviating
electron-lattice correlations and superconductivity. Density functional theory
($DFT$) guided modification of isolated $\rm Fe_{2-z}Se_2$ ($z$, vacant sites)
planes, resembling the host layers, identify that Fe-site deficiency occurs at
low energy cost, giving rise to stretched Fe-sheets, in accord with
experiments. The robust high-$T_c$ in $\rm Li_x(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$, arises
from the interplay of electron donating spacers and the iron-selenide layers
tolerance to defect chemistry, a tool to favorably tune its Fermi surface
properties.

A non-linear dispersion can significantly impact the Kondo problem, resulting
in anomalous effects on electronic transport. By analyzing a special bath with
a $\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}$ symmetry rotation in the Brillouin zone or 3-fold
symmetry in momentum, we derive an effective spin-spin interacting model.
Combining the anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction with
non-linear dispersion can lead to exceptional points $(E_p)$ in a Hermitian
model. Our RG analysis reveals that the spin relaxation time has the signature
of coalescence in momentum-resolved couplings and an ideal logarithmic
divergence in resistivity over a range of nonlinearity ($\beta$). The effective
model at the impurity subspace has a Lie group structure of Dirac matrices. We
show nontrivial renormalization within a Poorman approximation with the
inclusion of potential scattering, and the invariant obtained will not be
altered by potential scattering. We expand the model to a two-impurity Kondo
model and investigate the Kondo destruction and anomalous spin transport
signature by calculating the spin-relaxation time ($\tau$).Analysis of RG
equations zeros and poles show a "Sign Reversion" regime exists for a Hermitian
problem with a critical value of nonlinear coupling $J_{k^3}$. Our results show
the existence of an out-of-phase RKKY oscillation above and below the critical
value of the chemical potential.

The solid-state field-effect transistor, FET, and its theories were paramount
in the discovery and studies of graphene. In the past two decades, another
transistor based on conducting polymers called the organic electrochemical
transistor (ECT) was shown and largely studied. The main difference between
ECTs and FETs is the mode and extent of channel doping: while in FETs the
channel only has surface doping through dipoles, the mixed ionic-electronic
conductivity of the channel material in Organic ECTs enables bulk
electrochemical doping. As a result, the organic ECT maximizes conductance
modulation at the expense of speed. Until now ECTs have been based on
conducting polymers, but here we show for the first time that MXenes, a class
of 2D materials beyond graphene, have mixed ionic-electronic properties that
enable the realization of electrochemical transistors (ECTs). We show that the
formulas for organic ECTs can be applied to these 2D ECTs and used to extract
parameters like mobility. These MXene ECTs have high transconductance values
but low on-off ratios. We further show that conductance switching data measured
using ECT in combination with other in-situ ex-situ electrochemical
measurements, is a powerful tool for correlating the change in conductance to
that of redox state: to our knowledge, this is the first report of this
important correlation for MXene films. Many future possibilities exist for
MXenes ECTs, and we think other 2D materials with bandgaps can also form ECTs
with single or heterostructured 2D materials. 2D ECTs can draw great
inspiration and theoretical tools from the field of organic ECTs and have the
potential to considerably extend the capabilities of transistors beyond that of
conducting polymer ECTs, with added properties such as extreme heat resistance,
tolerance for solvents, and higher conductivity for both electrons and ions
than conducting polymers.

Coexistence of ferromagnetism, piezoelectricity and valley in two-dimensional
(2D) materials is crucial to advance multifunctional electronic technologies.
Here, Janus ScXY (X$\neq$Y=Cl, Br and I) monolayers are predicted to be
in-plane piezoelectric ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors with dynamical,
mechanical and thermal stabilities. The predicted piezoelectric strain
coefficients $d_{11}$ and $d_{31}$ (absolute values) are higher than ones of
most 2D materials. Moreover, the $d_{31}$ (absolute value) of ScClI reaches up
to 1.14 pm/V, which is highly desirable for ultrathin piezoelectric device
application. To obtain spontaneous valley polarization, charge doping are
explored to tune the direction of magnetization of ScXY. By appropriate hole
doping, their easy magnetization axis can change from in-plane to out-of-plane,
resulting in spontaneous valley polarization. Taking ScBrI with 0.20 holes per
f.u. as a example, under the action of an in-plane electric field, the hole
carriers of K valley turn towards one edge of the sample, which will produce
anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE), and the hole carriers of $\Gamma$ valley
move in a straight line. These findings could pave the way for designing
piezoelectric and valleytronic devices.

light-matter Hamiltonian, we devise a general strategy for obtaining simple
matrix models of polariton dispersion curves based on the structure and spatial
location of multi-layered 2D materials inside the optical cavity. Our theory
exposes the connections between seemingly distinct models that have been
employed in the literature and resolves an ambiguity that has arisen concerning
the experimental description of the polaritonic band structure. We demonstrate
the applicability of our theoretical formalism by fabricating various
geometries of multi-layered perovskite materials coupled to cavities and
demonstrating that our theoretical predictions agree with the experimental
results presented here.

Topological insulators are characterized by spin-momentum-locked massless
surface states which are robust under various perturbations. Manipulating such
surface states is a topic of vigorous research, as a possible route for the
realization of emergent many-body physics in topological systems. Thus far,
time-reversal symmetry breaking via Coulomb and magnetic perturbations has been
a dominant approach for the tuning of topological states. However, the effect
of the structural degrees of freedom on quasi-particle dynamics in topological
materials remains elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a transition in HfTe5
between distinct topological phases as a function of either Te vacancy
concentration or applied strain; these phases are characterized theoretically
as a transition from strong to weak topological insulator and experimentally by
a transition from sharp surface states and Dirac crossing to a
Fermi-liquid-like quasiparticle state in which these surface-localized features
are heavily suppressed. Although vacancies can result in various consequences
such as scattering, doping, and structural distortions, we show that changes in
the lattice constants play the foremost role in determining the electronic
structure, self-energy, and topological states of HfTe5. Our results
demonstrate the possibility of using both defect chemistry and strain as
control parameters for topological phase transitions and associated many-body
physics.

In disordered systems, the amplitudes of the localized states will decrease
exponentially away from their centers and the localization lengths are
characterizing such decreasing. In this article, we find a model in which each
eigenstate is decreasing at two distinct rates. The model is a one-dimensional
disordered system with a constrained Hilbert space: all eigenstates
$|\Psi\rangle$s should be orthogonal to a state $|\Phi \rangle$, $\langle \Phi
| \Psi \rangle =0$, where $|\Phi \rangle$ is a given exponentially localized
state. Although the dimension of the Hilbert space is only reduced by $1$, the
amplitude of each state will decrease at one rate near its center and at
another rate in the rest region, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig1}. Depending on $|
\Phi \rangle$, it is also possible that all states are changed from localized
states to extended states. In such a case, the level spacing distribution is
different from that of the three well-known ensembles of the random matrices.
This indicates that a new ensemble of random matrices exists in this model.
Finally we discuss the physics behind such phenomena and propose an experiment
to observe them.

Tissue growth kinetics and interface dynamics depend on the properties of the
tissue environment and cell-cell interactions. In cellular environments,
substrate heterogeneity and geometry arise from a variety factors, such as the
structure of the extracellular matrix and nutrient concentration. We used the
CellSim3D model, a kinetic division simulator, to investigate the growth
kinetics and interface roughness dynamics of epithelial tissue growth on
heterogeneous substrates with varying topologies. The results show that the
presence of quenched disorder has a clear effect on the colony morphology and
the roughness scaling of the interface in the moving interface regime. In a
medium with quenched disorder, the tissue interface has a smaller interface
roughness exponent, $\alpha$, and a larger growth exponent, $\beta$. The
scaling exponents also depend on the topology of the substrate and cannot be
categorized by well-known universality classes.

We develop analytical models of optical-field electron tunneling from the
edge and surface of two-dimensional (2D) materials, including the effects of
reduced dimensionality, non-parabolic energy dispersion, band anisotropy,
quasi-time dependent tunneling and emission dynamics indueced by the laser
field. We discover a universal scaling between the tunneling current density
$J$ and the laser electric field $F$: In($J/|F|^{\beta})\propto1/|F|$ with
$\beta = 3 / 2$ in the edge emission and $\beta = 1$ in the vertical surface
emission, which both are distinctive from the traditional Fowler-Nordheim (FN)
model of $\beta = 2$. The current density exhibits an unexpected high-field
saturation effect due to the reduced dimensionality of 2D materials, which is
completely different from the space-charge saturation commonly observed in
traditional bulk materials. Our results reveal the dc bias as an efficient
method in modulating the optical-field tunneling sub-optical-cycle emission
characteristics. Importantly, our model is in excellent agreement with a recent
experiment on graphene. Our findings offer a theoretical foundation for the
understanding of optical-field tunneling emission from the 2D material system,
which is useful for the development of 2D-material based optoelectronics and
vacuum nanoelectronics.

Manual analysis of XRD data is usually laborious and time consuming. The deep

to be an automatic, accurate, and high throughput method to analysis common XRD
data collected from solid sample in ambient environment. However, it remains
unknown that whether synthetic XRD based models are capable to solve u-XRD
mapping data for in-situ experiments involving liquid phase exhibiting lower
quality with significant artifacts. In this study, we collected u-XRD mapping
data from an LaCl3-calcite hydrothermal fluid system and trained two categories
of models to solve the experimental XRD patterns. The models trained by
synthetic XRD patterns show low accuracy (as low as 64%) when solving
experimental u-XRD mapping data. The accuracy of the DNN models was
significantly improved (90% or above) when training them with the dataset
containing both synthetic and small number of labeled experimental u-XRD

semiconductors, while its impact on the phonon structure and propagation is
seldom paid proper attention to. This work reveals that aliovalent doping can
be much more effective in reducing the lattice thermal conductivity of
thermoelectric semiconductors than the commonly employed isoelectronic alloying
strategy. As demonstrated in the heavy-band NbFeSb system, a large reduction of
65% in the lattice thermal conductivity is achieved through only 10% aliovalent
Hf-doping, compared to the 4 times higher isoelectronic Ta-alloying. It is
elucidated that aliovalent doping introduces free charge carriers and enhances
the screening, leading to the giant softening and deceleration of optical
phonons. Moreover, the heavy dopant can induce the avoided-crossing of acoustic
and optical phonon branches, further decelerating the acoustic phonons. These
results highlight the significant role of aliovalent dopants in regulating the
phonon structure and suppressing the phonon propagation of semiconductors.

<h3>Mpemba effect in driven granular gases: role of distance measures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10900</a>

<br>
Mpemba effect refers to the counterintuitive effect where a system which is
initially further from the final steady state equilibrates faster than an
identical system that is initially closer. The closeness to the final state is
defined in terms of a distance measure. For driven granular systems, the Mpemba
effect has been illustrated in terms of an ad-hoc measure of mean kinetic
energy as the distance function. In this paper, by studying four different
distance measures based on the mean kinetic energies as well as velocity
distribution, we show that the Mpemba effect depends on the definition of the
measures.

<h3>Magnetization, dielectric and thermal studies in the double perovskite  polycrystalline compound Tm2CoMnO6</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report here a comprehensive study on structural, magnetic, caloric and
electronic properties of the monoclinic phase of double perovskite compound
Tm2CoMnO6 (TCMO) in its polycrysttaline format. Magnetic measurements confirm
the presence of thermal hysteresis in magnetization indicates towards a first
order magnetic transition at its critical point (Tc). Our study finds the
metamagnetic jump in isothermal M(H) at 2 K that signifies the rare earth spin
allignement in loop cycling above a certain critical field. This jump is only
present at very low T that dies out as the T raises. M(H) measurements at
different temperature stipulate that Co2+ and Mn4+ do not order completely
inspite of strong ferromagnetic correlation that is against the previous study
on TCMO. The concurrence of structral, magnetic and dielectric anomaly at Tc
suggest its possible magnetostructural copuling. We found a high dielectric
constant (2700) in TCMO and the Maxwell-Wagner electrial loss spectrum analysis
hints towards a long range hopping mechanism. Sizeable magnetocaloric effect in
terms of entropy change across the transition temperatures has been obtained
from heat capacity data that clearly corroborates its intrinsic behaviour.

<br>
We propose a 3D topolectrical (TE) network that can be tuned to realize
various higher-order topological gapless and chiral phases. We first study a
higher-order Dirac semimetal phase that exhibits a hinge-like Fermi arc linking
the Dirac points. This circuit can be extended to host highly tunable first-
and second-order Weyl semimetal phases by introducing a non-reciprocal
resistive coupling in the x-y plane that breaks time reversal symmetry. The
first- and second-order Weyl points are connected by zero-admittance surface
and hinge states, respectively. We also study the emergence of first- and
second-order chiral modes induced by resistive couplings between similar nodes
in the z-direction. These modes respectively occur in the midgap of the surface
and hinge admittance bands in our circuit model without the need for any
external magnetic field.

The spectral landscape and the transport property of a translationally
invariant network with side-coupled quantum dots are demonstrated within the
tight-binding framework. For periodic environment band structure is
demonstrated analytically in details. Moreover, if the side-coupling here
follows a typical quasiperiodic Aubry-Andre-Harper type of modulation then such
off-diagonal disorder invites an exotic spectral feature for this model quantum
system. We perform an in-depth numerical analysis followed by the evaluation of
the density of eigenstates and the inverse participation ratio. The description
shows that this network creates a typical self-similar kind of multifractal
pattern in the energy landscape. The impacts of the strength of such aperiodic
connectivity and the slowness parameter are reported in this analysis. In the
present era of advanced technology and lithography techniques all such
non-trivial results definitely throw an achievable challenge to the
experimentalists to study the localization of excitation in such network

<br>
<br>
Linear and nonlinear optical lineshapes reveal details of excitonic structure
in semiconductor polymers. We implement absorption, photoluminescence, and
transient absorption spectroscopies in DPP-DTT, an electron push-pull
copolymer, to explore the relationship between their spectral lineshapes and
chain conformation, deduced from resonance Raman spectroscopy and from
\textit{ab initio} calculations. The viscosity of precursor polymer solutions
before film casting displays a transition that suggests gel formation above a
critical concentration. Upon crossing this viscosity deflection concentration,
the lineshape analysis of the absorption spectra within a photophysical
aggregate model reveals a gradual increase in interchain excitonic coupling. We
also observe a red-shifted and line-narrowed steady-state photoluminescence
spectrum, along with increasing resonance Raman intensity in the stretching and
torsional modes of the dithienothiphene unit, which suggests a longer exciton
coherence length along the polymer-chain backbone. Furthermore, we observe a
change of lineshape in the photoinduced absorption component of the transient
absorption spectrum. The derivative-like lineshape may originate from two
possibilities: a new excited-state absorption, or from optical Stark effect,
both of which are consistent with the emergence of high-energy shoulder as seen
in both photoluminescence and absorption spectra. Therefore, we conclude that
the exciton is more dispersed along the polymer chain backbone with increasing
concentrations, leading to the hypothesis that the polymer chain order is
enhanced when the push-pull polymers are processed at higher concentrations.
Thus, tuning the microscopic chain conformation by concentration would be
another factor of interest when considering the polymer assembly pathways for
pursuing large-area and high-performance organic optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Complete Suppression of Phase Segregation in Mixed-Halide Perovskite  Nanocrystals under Periodic Heating</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10938" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10938</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Under continuous light illumination, it is known that localized domains with
segregated halide compositions form in semiconducting mixed-halide perovskites,
thus severely limiting their optoelectronic applications due to the negative
changes in bandgap energies and charge-carrier characteristics. Here we deposit
mixed-halide perovskite CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals onto an indium tin oxide
substrate, whose temperature can be rapidly changed by ~10 degree in a few
seconds by applying or removing an external voltage. Such a sudden temperature
change induces a temporary transition of CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals from the
segregated phase to the mixed phase, the latter of which can be permanently
maintained when the light illumination is coupled with periodic heating cycles.
These findings mark the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental
phase-segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily
available in various fundamental studies and practical devices using
mixed-halide perovskites.

<h3>Tighter upper bounds on the critical temperature of two-dimensional  superconductors and superfluids from the BCS to the Bose regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10939" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10939</a>
<br>
<i>Tingting Shi, Wei Zhang, C. A. R. Sá de Melo</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss standard and tighter upper bounds on the critical temperature
$T_c$ of two-dimensional (2D) superconductors and superfluids versus particle
density $n$ or filling factor $\nu$ for continuum and lattice systems from the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose regime. We discuss only one-band
Hamiltonians, where the transition from the normal to superconducting
(superfluid) phase is governed by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
mechanism of vortex-antivortex binding, such that a direct relation between the
superfluid density tensor and $T_c$ exists. We demonstrate that it is
imperative to consider at least the full effect of phase fluctuations of order
parameter for superconductivity (superfluidity) to establish tighter bounds.
Using the renormalization group, we obtain phase-fluctuation critical
temperature $T_c^{\theta}$, a much tighter upper bound to critical temperature
supremum $T_c^{\rm sup}$ than standard critical temperature upper bound
$T_c^{\rm up1}$ from Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule. We go beyond textbook
phase-fluctuation theories and show that chemical potential renormalization,
order parameter equation, and Nelson-Kosterlitz relation need to be solved
self-consistently and simultaneously with renormalization group flow equation
to produce $T_c^{\theta}$ over the entire BCS-Bose crossover. We note that an
analytic theory including modulus fluctuations of the order parameter valid
throughout the BCS-Bose evolution is still lacking, but the inclusion of
modulus fluctuations can only produce a critical temperature lower than
$T_c^{\theta}$ and thus produce an even tighter bound to $T_c^{\rm sup}$. We
conclude by indicating that if the measured critical temperature exceeds
$T_c^{\theta}$ in experiments involving 2D single-band systems, then a non-BKT
mechanism must be invoked to describe the superconducting (superfluid)
transition.

The ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6 attracts attention because of a recently discovered
colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) with unique magnetic field properties. An
improved magnetic structure for the material has emerged from a neutron
diffraction study linked to understanding the CMR. A deeper theoretical
investigation of the magnetic structure has now revealed anapole, chiral and
orbital states of manganese ions not previously mentioned. Moreover, it is
shown that existence of these states in the low temperature form of Mn3Si2Te6,
with a magnetic field applied, can be tested by neutron and resonant x-ray
diffraction.

<h3>Topological and non-topological mechanisms of loops formation in  chromosomes: effects on the contact probability</h3>

Chromosomes are crumpled polymer chains further folded into a sequence of
stochastic loops via loop extrusion. While extrusion has been verified
experimentally, the particular means by which the extruding complexes bind DNA
polymer remains controversial. Here we analyze the behaviour of the contact
probability function for a crumpled polymer with loops for the two possible
modes of cohesin binding, topological and non-topological mechanisms. As we
show, in the non-topological model the chain with loops resembles a comb-like
polymer that can be solved analytically using the quenched disorder approach.
In contrast, in the topological binding case the loop constraints are
statistically coupled due to long-range correlations present in a non-ideal
chain, which can be described by the perturbation theory in the limit of small
loop densities. As we show, the quantitative effect of loops on a crumpled
chain in the case of topological binding should be stronger, which is
translated into a larger amplitude of the log-derivative of the contact
probability. Our results highlight a physically different organization of a
crumpled chain with loops by the two mechanisms of loops formation.

Effective scaffolds for bone tissue-engineering are those that combine
adequate mechanical and chemical performance with osseointegrative,
angiogenetic and anti-bacterial modes of bioactivity. To address these
requirements via a combined approach, we additively manufactured square strut
scaffolds by robocasting precipitation-derived strontium/copper co-substituted
diopside. Microstructure, mechanical performance, bioactivity,
biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity were examined. The results show
that the presence of strontium and copper in the diopside lattice reduces the
grain size and increases the density of the ceramics. The compressive strength,
hardness, and fracture toughness of the diopside showed improvement, attributed
to a finer microstructure and improved sintering. Scaffolds had excellent
compressive strength with a high porosity (68 to 72 %), which is attributed to
the structure of the stacked square struts. All materials showed good in vitro
bioactivity and favorable proliferation of osteogenic sarcoma cells, while
strontium and copper co-doped materials exhibited the strongest
anti-Escherichia coli activity. We show that across multiple indicators this
system offers pathways towards high-performance bone substitutes.

The centred pyrochlore lattice is a novel geometrically frustrated lattice,
realized in the metal-organic framework Mn(ta)$_2$ (arXiv:2203.08780) where the
basic unit of spins is a five site centred tetrahedron. Here, we present an
in-depth theoretical study of the $J_1-J_2$ classical Heisenberg model on this
lattice, using a combination of mean-field analytical methods and Monte Carlo
simulations. We find a rich phase diagram with low temperature states
exhibiting ferrimagnetic order, partial ordering, and a highly degenerate spin
liquid with distinct regimes of low temperature correlations. We discuss in
detail how the regime displaying broadened pinch points in its spin structure
factor is consistent with an effective description in terms of a fluid of
interacting charges. We also show how this picture holds in two dimensions on
the analogous centred kagome lattice and elucidate the connection to the
physics of thin films in ($d+1$) dimensions. Furthermore, we show that a
Coulomb phase can be stabilized on the centred pyrochlore lattice by the
addition of further neighbour couplings. This demonstrates the centred
pyrochlore lattice is an experimentally relevant geometry which naturally hosts
emergent gauge fields in the presence of charges at low energies.

<h3>Symmetry-adapted modeling for molecules and crystals</h3>

We have developed a symmetry-adapted modeling procedure for molecules and
crystals. By using the completeness of multipoles to express spatial and
time-reversal parity-specific anisotropic distributions, we can generate
systematically the complete symmetry-adapted multipole basis set to describe
any of electronic degrees of freedom in isolated cluster systems and periodic
crystals. The symmetry-adapted modeling is then achieved by expressing the
Hamiltonian in terms of the linear combination of these bases belonging to the
identity irreducible representation, and the model parameters (linear
coefficients) in the Hamiltonian can be determined so as to reproduce the
electronic structures given by the density-functional computation. We
demonstrate our method for the modeling of graphene, and emphasize usefulness
of the symmetry-adapted basis to analyze and predict physical phenomena and
spontaneous symmetry breaking in a phase transition. The present method is
complementary to de-facto standard Wannier tight-binding modeling, and it
provides us with a fundamental basis to develop a symmetry-based analysis for
materials science.

Additively manufactured hollow strut bioceramic scaffolds present a promising
strategy towards enhanced performance in patient-tailored bone tissue
engineering. The channels in such scaffolds offer pathways for nutrient and
cell transport and facilitate effective osseointegration and vascularization.
In this study, we report an approach for the slurry based additive
manufacturing of modified diopside bioceramics that enables the production of
hollow-strut scaffolds with diverse cross-sectional forms, distinguished by
different configurations of channel and strut geometries. The prepared
scaffolds exhibit levels of porosity and mechanical strength that are well
suited for osteoporotic bone repair. Mechanical characterization in orthogonal
orientations revealed that a square outer cross-section for hollow struts in
woodpile scaffolds gives rise to levels of compressive strength that are higher
than those of conventional solid cylindrical strut scaffolds despite a
significantly lower density. Finite element analysis confirms that this
improved strength arises from lower stress concentration in such geometries. It
was shown that hollow struts in bioceramic scaffolds dramatically increase cell
attachment and proliferation, potentially promoting new bone tissue formation
within the scaffold channel. This work provides an easily controlled method for
the extrusion-based 3D printing of hollow strut scaffolds. We show here how the
production of hollow struts with controllable geometry can serve to enhance
both the functional and mechanical performance of porous structures, with
particular relevance for bone tissue engineering scaffolds.

We study conformational properties of diluted dumbbell polymers which consist
of two rings that are attached to both ends of a linear spacer segment by using
analytical methods of field theory and bead-spring coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulations. We investigate the influence of the relative length of
the spacer segment to the length of side rings on the shape and the relative
size of dumbbells as compared to linear polymers of equal mass. We find that
dumbbells with short spacers are much more compact than linear polymers.
Oppositely, we observe that the influence of side rings on the size of
dumbbells becomes negligible with increasing length of a spacer. Consequently
dumbbell molecules with long spacers become comparable in size with
corresponding linear chains. Our analytical theory predicts quantitative
cross-over between short- and long-spacer behavior and is confirmed by
numerical simulations.

Clarifying the electronic and magnetic properties of lutetium, lutetium
dihydride, and lutetium oxide is very helpful to understand the emergent
phenomena in lutetium-based compounds (such as room-temperature
superconductivity). However, this kind of study is still scarce at present.
Here, we report on the electronic and magnetic properties of lutetium metals,
lutetium dihydride powders, and lutetium oxide powders. Crystal structures and
chemical compositions of these samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction
and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, respectively. Electrical transport
measurements show that the resistance of lutetium has a linear behavior
depending on temperature, whereas the resistance of lutetium dihydride powders
is independent of temperature. More interestingly,
paramagnetism-ferromagnetism-spin glass transitions were observed at near 240
and 200 K, respectively, in lutetium metals. Our work uncovered the complex
magnetic properties of Lu-based compounds.

Superconductivity is caused by electron pairs that are canonically isotropic,
whereas some exotic superconductors are known to exhibit non-trivial anisotropy
stemming from unconventional pairings. However, superconductors with hexagonal
symmetry, the highest rotational symmetry allowed in crystals, exceptionally
have strong constraint that is called emergent rotational symmetry (ERS):
anisotropic properties should be very weak especially near the critical
temperature Tc even for unconventional pairings such as d-wave states. Here, we
investigate superconducting anisotropy of the recently-found hexagonal Kagome
superconductor CsV3Sb5, which is known to exhibit various intriguing phenomena
originating from its undistorted Kagome lattice formed by vanadium atoms. Based
on calorimetry performed under accurate two-axis field-direction control, we
discover a combination of six- and two-fold anisotropies in the in-plane upper
critical field. Both anisotropies, robust up to very close to Tc, are beyond
predictions of standard theories. We infer that this clear ERS violation with
nematicity is best explained by multi-component nematic superconducting order
parameter in CsV3Sb5 intertwined with symmetry breakings caused by the
underlying charge-density-wave order.

Molecular simulations employing empiric force fields have provided valuable
knowledge about the ice growth process in the last decade. The development of
novel computational techniques allows us to study this process, which requires
long simulations of relatively large systems, with ab initio accuracy. In this
work, we use a neural-network potential for water trained on the Revised
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional to describe the kinetics of the ice-water
interface. We study both ice melting and growth processes. Our results for the
ice growth rate are in reasonable agreement with previous experiments and
simulations. We find that the kinetics of ice melting presents a different
behavior (monotonic) than that of ice growth (non-monotonic). In particular, a
maximum in the ice growth rate of 6.5 {\AA}/ns is found at 14 K of
supercooling. The effect of the surface structure is explored by investigating
the basal and primary and secondary prismatic facets. We use the Wilson-Frenkel
relation to explain these results in terms of the mobility of molecules and the
thermodynamic driving force. Moreover, we study the effect of pressure by
complementing the standard isobar with simulations at negative pressure (-1000
bar) and at high pressure (2000 bar). We find that prismatic facets grow faster
than the basal one, and that pressure does not play an important role when the
speed of the interface is considered as a function of the difference between
the melting temperature and the actual one, i.e. to the degree of either
supercooling or overheating.

Mg batteries with oxide cathodes have the potential to significantly surpass
existing Li-ion technologies in terms of sustainability, abundance, and energy
density. However, Mg intercalation at the cathode is often severely hampered by
the sluggish kinetics of Mg$^{2+}$ migration within oxides. Here we report a
combined theoretical and experimental study addressing routes to identify
cathode materials with an improved Mg-ion mobility. Using periodic density
functional theory calculations, Mg$^{2+}$ migration in oxide spinels has been
studied, revealing key features that influence the activation energy for
Mg$^{2+}$ migration. Furthermore, the electronic and geometrical properties of
the oxide spinels as well as their stability have been analyzed for a series of
different transition metals in the spinels. We find that electronegative
transition metals enable a high Mg-ion mobility in the oxide spinel frameworks
and thus a favorable cathode functionality. Based on the theoretical findings,
some promising candidates have been identified, prepared and structurally
characterized. Our combined theoretical and experimental findings open up an
avenue toward the utilization of functional cathode materials with improved
Mg$^{2+}$ transport properties for Mg-metal batteries.

Isotropic, but otherwise largely arbitrary Heisenberg models in the presence
of a homogeneous magnetic field are considered, including various integrable,
non-integrable, as well as disordered examples, and not necessarily restricted
to one dimension or short-range interactions. Taking for granted that the
non-equilibrium initial condition and the spectrum of the field-free model
satisfy some very weak requirements, expectation values of generic observables
are analytically shown to exhibit permanent long-time oscillations, thus ruling
out equilibration. If the model (but not necessarily the initial condition) is
translationally invariant, the long-time oscillations are moreover shown to
exhibit synchronization in the long run, meaning that they are invariant under
arbitrary translations of the observable. Analogous long-time oscillations are
also recovered for temporal correlation functions when the system is already at
thermal equilibrium from the outset, thus realizing a so-called time crystal.

The interplay between a topological degeneracy and the residue degeneracy
(also known as the residue entropy) of quantum criticality remains as an
important but not thoroughly understood topic. We find that the degeneracy of
topological parity, provided by a Majorana zero mode pair, relaxes the
otherwise strictly requested symmetry requirement, to observe the boundary
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition (QPT) of a
dissipative resonant level. Our work indicates that the topological-parity
degeneracy can be potentially viewed as an auxiliary symmetry that realizes a
robust boundary QPT. The relaxation of the symmetry requirement extends the
transition from a point to a finite area, thus greatly reducing the difficulty
to experimentally observe the QPT. This topology-involved exotic BKT phase
diagram, on the other hand, provides a piece of convincing evidence for a
Majorana zero mode.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are two-dimensional (2D) materials
with remarkable electrical, optical and chemical properties. One promising
strategy to tailor TMD properties of TMDs is to create alloys through
dopant-induced modification. Dopants can introduce additional states within the
bandgap of TMDs, leading to changes in their optical, electronic, and magnetic
properties. This paper overviews chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods to
introduce dopants into TMD monolayers. The advantages and limitations and their
impacts on the doped TMDs' structural, electrical, optical, and magnetic
properties are discussed. The dopants in TMDs modify the density and type of
carriers in the material, thereby influencing the optical properties of the
materials. The TMDs' magnetic moment and circular dichroism are also strongly
affected by doping, which enhances the magnetic signal in the material.
Finally, we highlight the different doping-induced magnetic properties of TMDs,
including superexchange-induced ferromagnetism and valley Zeeman shift.
Overall, this review paper provides a comprehensive summary of magnetic TMDs
synthesized via CVD, which can guide future research on doped TMDs for various
applications, such as spintronics, optoelectronics, and magnetic memory
devices.

The superconductor SnTaS$_{2}$ is theoretically predicted to be an intriguing
topological nodal line semimetal without consideration of spin-orbit coupling.
By carrying out angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES
measurements combined with band structure calculations, we have provided a
complete picture of the electronic structure and spin polarization property for
the prominent surface states of SnTaS$_{2}$. The low-energy electronic states
are dominated by surface states; two of them are from the S-terminated surface,
while four of them are from the Sn-terminated surface. These give rise to
interesting Fermi surface topology of SnTaS$_{2}$: three pockets located at
$\bar\Gamma$, $\bar{M}$ and $\bar{K}$ for the S-terminated surface and two
pockets surrounding $\bar\Gamma$ and $\bar{K}$ for the Sn-terminated surface.
We further reveal that two surface states that cross the Fermi level are
spin-polarized. Since SnTaS$_{2}$ is also a superconductor, our observations
indicate that it may provide a new platform to explore topological
superconductivity and other exotic properties.

The discovery of the topological states has become a key topic in condensed
matter physics with the focus evolving from the Dirac or Weyl points to
high-dimension topological states of the nodal lines and nodal surfaces. For a
topological material to manifest its quantum properties and become useful in
applications, the topological states need to be genuine and clean so that they
lie close to the Fermi level without other trivial bands existing at the Fermi
level. While a number of high-dimension topological materials are predicted,
only a few of them have been synthesized and confirmed and the genuine and
clean ones are especially scarce. Here we report the realization of the genuine
clean multiple high-dimension topological states in NaAlSi. By performing
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements and band structure
calculations, we have observed two sets of nodal surfaces and the formation of
two homocentric nodal ring states in NaAlSi. The observed nodal rings are
distinct in that the inner one is a
type-{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}} nodal ring while the outer one is
a type-{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}} nodal ring embedded with four
type-{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}} nodal points. All the bands
involved in the nodal rings lie very close to the Fermi level with no other
trivial bands coexisting at the Fermi level. These observations make NaAlSi a
desirable topological material to explore for novel quantum states and exotic
properties.

We investigate - both experimentally and theoretically - the inelastic
interaction between fast electrons and the electromagnetic field scattered by
metallic apertures and nanostructures on dielectric membranes using photon
induced near-field electron microscopy. The experiments - performed in a high
brightness ultrafast transmission electron microscope - on gold apertures on
silicon nitride membranes reveal strong modulations of the electron-light
coupling strength. We demonstrates that this effect results from the combined
action of the electric field scattered by the aperture edges and the reflection
and transmission of the incident wave by the dielectric membrane. Moreover,
when a nanostructure is added inside the metallic aperture, the new scattered
field interferes with the previous contributions, thus imprinting the optical
response of the nanostructure in additional modulations of the electron-light
coupling strength. Using systematic electrodynamics simulations based on the
Green dyadic method, we quantitatively analyze these different contributions to
the electron-light coupling and propose further applications.

The simulation of strongly correlated quantum impurity models is a
significant challenge in modern condensed matter physics that has multiple
important applications. Thus far, the most successful methods for approaching
this challenge involve Monte Carlo techniques that accurately and reliably
sample perturbative expansions to any order. However, the cost of obtaining
high precision through these methods is high. Recently, tensor train
decomposition techniques have been developed as an alternative to Monte Carlo
integration. In this study, we apply these techniques to the single-impurity
Anderson model at equilibrium by calculating the systematic expansion in power
of the hybridization of the impurity with the bath. We demonstrate the
performance of the method in a paradigmatic application, examining the
first-order phase transition on the infinite dimensional Bethe lattice, which
can be mapped to an impurity model through dynamical mean field theory. Our
results indicate that using tensor train decomposition schemes allows the
calculation of finite-temperature Green's functions and thermodynamic
observables with unprecedented accuracy. The methodology holds promise for
future applications to frustrated multi-orbital systems, using a combination of
partially summed series with other techniques pioneered in diagrammatic and
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo.

We demonstrate ion irradiation as a wafer-scale method for the fabrication of
amorphous superconducting thin films. We explore irradiation using argon and
gallium ions on single-element and compound materials. Our results indicate
that both ions increase disorder in the atomic structure in a qualitatively
similar manner, i.e., they destroy the grain structure, increase resistivity
and alter the superconducting transition temperature. However, argon
irradiation tends to yield gas pockets that can be detrimental for
applications. We show that gallium irradiation allows to produce a thin,
uniform, and amorphous molybdenum silicide film that is promising, e.g., for
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), originally developed for natural language
processing, hold great promise for accurately describing strongly correlated
quantum many-body systems. Here, we employ 2D RNNs to investigate two
prototypical quantum many-body Hamiltonians exhibiting topological order.
Specifically, we demonstrate that RNN wave functions can effectively capture
the topological order of the toric code and a Bose-Hubbard spin liquid on the
kagome lattice by estimating their topological entanglement entropies. We also
find that RNNs favor coherent superpositions of minimally-entangled states over
minimally-entangled states themselves. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
RNN wave functions constitute a powerful tool to study phases of matter beyond
Landau's symmetry-breaking paradigm.

<h3>Proximity effect and spatial Kibble-Zurek mechanism in atomic Fermi  gases with inhomogeneous pairing interactions</h3>

<br>
<i>Bishal Parajuli, Chih-Chun Chien</i>
<br>
<br>
Introducing spatially tunable interactions to atomic Fermi gases makes it
feasible to study two phenomena, the proximity effect and spatial Kibble-Zurek
mechanism (KZM), in a unified platform. While the proximity effect of a
superconductor adjacent to a normal metal corresponds to a step-function quench
of the pairing interaction in real space, the spatial KZM is based on a linear
drop of the interaction that can be modeled as a spatial quench. After
formulating the Fermi gases with spatially varying pairing interactions by the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation, we obtain the profiles of the pair
wavefunction and its correlation function to study their penetration into the
noninteracting region. For the step-function quench, both correlation lengths
from the pair wavefunction and its correlation function follow the BCS
coherence length and exhibit the same scaling behavior. In contrast, the
exponents from the two correlation lengths are different in the spatial quench.
Only the exponent from the pair correlation function agrees with the KZM
prediction. Therefore, the spatial quench allows more refined analyses of the
correlation lengths from different physical quantities. Moreover, adding a
weakly interacting bosonic background does not change the scaling behavior. We
also discuss relevant experimental techniques that may realize and verify the
inhomogeneous phenomena.

The temperature dependent order parameter provides important information on
the nature of magnetism. Using traditional methods to study this parameter in
two-dimensional (2D) magnets remains difficult, however, particularly for
insulating antiferromagnetic (AF) compounds. Here, we show that its temperature
dependence in AF MPS$_{3}$ (M(II) = Fe, Co, Ni) can be probed via the
anisotropy in the resonance frequency of rectangular membranes, mediated by a
combination of anisotropic magnetostriction and spontaneous staggered
magnetization. Density functional calculations followed by a derived
orbital-resolved magnetic exchange analysis confirm and unravel the microscopic
origin of this magnetization inducing anistropic strain. We further show that
the temperature and thickness dependent order parameter allows to deduce the
material's critical exponents characterising magnetic order. Nanomechanical
sensing of magnetic order thus provides a future platform to investigate 2D
magnetism down to the single-layer limit.

The controllable synthesis of iron oxides particles is a critical issue for
materials science, energy storage, biomedical applications, environmental
science, and earth science. However, synthesis of iron oxides with desired
phase and size are still a time-consuming and trial-and-error process. This
study presents solutions for two fundamental challenges in materials synthesis:
predicting the outcome of a synthesis from specified reaction parameters and
correlating sets of parameters to obtain products with desired outcomes. Four
machine learning algorithms, including random forest, logistic regression,
support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor, were trained to predict the
phase and particle size of iron oxide based on experimental conditions. Among
the models, random forest exhibited the best performance, achieving 96% and 81%
accuracy when predicting the phase and size of iron oxides in the test dataset.
Premutation feature importance analysis shows that most models (except logistic
regression) rely on known features such as precursor concentration, pH, and
temperature to predict the phases from synthesis conditions. The robustness of
the random forest models was further verified by comparing prediction and
experimental results based on 24 randomly generated methods in additive and
non-additive systems not included in the datasets. The predictions of product
phase and particle size from the models are in good agreement with the
experimental results. Additionally, a searching and ranking algorithm was
developed to recommend potential synthesis parameters for obtaining iron oxide
products with desired phase and particle size from previous studies in the
dataset.

<h3>The continuum of metastable conical states of monoaxial chiral  helimagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
At low temperature and zero applied magnetic field, besides the equilibrium
helical state, monoaxial chiral helimagnets have a continuum of helical states
differing by the wave number of the modulation. The wave number of these states
in units of the equilibrium state wave number is denoted here by p, and
accordingly the corresponding states are called the p-states. In this work we
study in detail the metastability of the p-states. The application of an
external magnetic field in the direction of the chiral axis has a double
effect: on one hand, it introduces a conical deformation of the p-states, and
on the other hand it destabilizes some of them, shrinking the range of p in
which the p-states are metastable. If a polarized current is applied along the
chiral axis, the p-states reach a steady moving state with a constant velocity
proportional to the current intensity. Besides this dynamical effect, the
polarized current also induces a conical deformation and reduces the range of
stability of the p-states. The stability diagram in the plane applied field -
applied current intensity has interesting features that, among other things,
permit the manipulation of p-states by a combination of applied fields and
currents. These features can be exploited to devise processes to switch between
p-states. In particular there are p-states with negative p, opening the
possibility to helicity switching. The theoretical feasibility of such
processes, crucial from the point of view of applications, is shown by
micromagnetic simulations. Analogous $p$-states exists in cubic chiral
helimagnets and therefore similar effects are expected in those systems.

We generalize the concept of vortex phase in a type II superconductor to
textured phases, where certain phases can persist over an extended range of
perturbations by confining competing phases on topological defects (the
vortices in a superconductor). We apply this model to the pseudogap phase in
cuprates, where the relevant topological defects are the antiphase domain walls
of an underlying antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. We demonstrate that this model
can describe many key features of intertwined orders in cuprates, and most
importantly provide the first clear evidence for the Mott-Slater transition in
cuprates.

<h3>Anomalous second-order skin modes in Floquet non-Hermitian systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Chun-Hui Liu, Haiping Hu, Shu Chen, Xiong-Jun Liu</i>
<br>

The non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary conditions is widely
believed to originate from the intrinsic spectral topology under periodic
boundary conditions. If the eigenspectra under periodic boundary conditions
have no spectral windings (e.g., piecewise arcs) or a finite area on the
complex plane, there will be no non-Hermitian skin effect with open boundaries.
In this article, we demonstrate another scenario beyond this perception by
introducing a two-dimensional periodically driven model. The effective Floquet
Hamiltonian lacks intrinsic spectral topology and is proportional to the
identity matrix (representing a single point on the complex plane) under
periodic boundary conditions. Yet, the Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits a
second-order skin effect that is robust against perturbations and disorder
under open boundary conditions. We further reveal the dynamical origin of these
second-order skin modes and illustrate that they are characterized by a
dynamical topological invariant of the full time-evolution operator.

<br>
<br>
Fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) at even-denominator Landau level
filling factors ($\nu$) are of prime interest as they are predicted to host
exotic, topological states of matter. We report here the observation of a FQHS
at $\nu=1/2$ in a two-dimensional electron system of exceptionally high
quality, confined to a wide AlAs quantum well, where the electrons can occupy
multiple conduction-band valleys with an anisotropic effective mass. The
anisotropy and multi-valley degree of freedom offer an unprecedented tunability
of the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS as we can control both the valley occupancy via the
application of in-plane strain, and the ratio between the strengths of the
short- and long-range Coulomb interaction by tilting the sample in the magnetic
field to change the electron charge distribution. Thanks to this tunability, we
observe phase transitions from a compressible Fermi liquid to an incompressible
FQHS and then to an insulating phase as a function of tilt angle. We find that
this evolution and the energy gap of the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS depend strongly on
valley occupancy.

<br>
<br>
Coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple
excitations (CCSD(T)) -- often considered the "gold standard" of main-group
quantum chemistry -- is inapplicable to three-dimensional metals due to an
infrared divergence, preventing its application to many important problems in
materials science. We study the full, nonperturbative inclusion of triple
excitations (CCSDT) and propose a new, iterative method, which we call
ring-CCSDT, that resums the essential triple excitations with the same $N^7$
run-time scaling as CCSD(T). CCSDT and ring-CCSDT are used to calculate the
correlation energy of the uniform electron gas at metallic densities and the
structural properties of solid lithium. Inclusion of connected triple
excitations is shown to be essential to achieving high accuracy. We also
investigate semiempirical CC methods based on spin-component scaling and the
distinguishable cluster approximation and find that they enhance the accuracy
of their parent ab initio methods.

We fabricated Pt/La0.5Ba0.5MnO3 ultrathin films with integration to the
PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 ferroelectric. Strong Topological Hall Effect can be measured
across a wide temperature range, which can be turned on and off corresponding
to the ferroelectric polarization switching driven by short voltage pulses,
indicating creation and annihilation of magnetic Skyrmions. However, its
magnetoelectric coupling polarity was found to be opposite to the earlier
consensus, which involves a phase transition between ferromagnetic and A-type
antiferromagnetic in manganites due to electrostatic doping into the
eg-orbitals by the ferroelectric bound charges. In our case, we propose a novel
yet complementary picture where the transition occurs between C-type
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic. The distinction between the earlier
consensus and our picture lies at the tetragonal distortion of the manganite
unit cell, resulting in an opposite magnetoelectric coupling polarity. We
support the perceived relationship between the phase transition and tuning of
Topological Hall Effect by micromagnetic simulations.

We explore the effect of heat treatment in argon atmosphere under various
temperatures up to $500^\circ$C on single crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ by
study of the mass loss, microprobe energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, powder
x-ray diffraction, electrical resistance as well as low-temperature magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat. Clear signatures of dechlorination and
oxidation of Ru appear for annealing temperatures beyond $300^\circ$C. Analysis
of the specific heat below 2~K reveals a RuO$_2$ mass fraction of order $1\%$
for pristine $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ which increases up to $20\%$ after thermal
annealing, fully consistent with mass-loss analysis. The small RuO$_2$
inclusions drastically reduce the global electrical resistance and may thus
significantly affect low-temperature thermal transport and Hall effect.

Pairs of correlated particles are at the core of complex many-body phenomena
and their control is essential for quantum technologies. Engineering pairs that
are simultaneously correlated in their external and internal degrees of freedom
is a major challenge. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a mechanism
for generating pairs of atoms in well-defined spin and momentum modes. This
mechanism couples atoms from a degenerate Bose gas via a superradiant
photon-exchange process mediated by the vacuum mode of an optical cavity. The
scheme is independent of collisional interactions, fast and tunable. We observe
a collectively enhanced production of pairs, characterize their statistics, and
measure inter-spin correlations in momentum space. Our observation of coherent
many-body oscillations involving well-defined momentum modes offers promising
prospects for quantum-enhanced interferometry using entangled matter waves.
