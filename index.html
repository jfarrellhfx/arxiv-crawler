<h3>Time-domain interferometry of electron weak localization through  terahertz nonlinear response</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16867" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16867</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zi-Long Li, Xiao-Hui Li, Yuan Wan</i>
<p>We study theoretically the nonlinear optical response of disordered electrons
in the regime of weak (anti)localization. Our analytical and numerical
calculations reveal that, in orthogonal/symplectic class systems, two
consecutive, phase coherent optical pulses generates an electric current echo
that appears after the second pulse, and at a time equal to the pulse delay
time. The current echo reflects the quantum interference between a
self-intersecting electron path and its time reversal partner, and, therefore,
provide a time-domain interferometry of weak (anti)localization. Our results
can be potentially tested on disordered metal films by using terahertz
two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy or ultrafast transport measurements.

<h3>Controllable suppression of Non-Hermitian skin effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16901" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16901</a>

</p><i>Xu Chao, Guan Zhiqiang, Xu Hongxing</i>
<p>The Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a phenomenon in which the bulk states
tends to the boundary in Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and has a wide range of
application scenarios. The fully understanding of the skin mode anomalies in
NHSEs is vital for the application. Recently, some innovative work reported the
suppression [Phys. Rev. Lett 127, 256402 (2021)] and enhancement [Phys. Rev.
Lett 131, 116601 (2023)] of NHSEs by magnetic field, respectively. In our work,
we constructed magnetic field-like onsite potential energy distribution and
random-like onsite potential energy distribution, and found that onsite
potential energy has non-monotonic and monotonic suppression patterns on skin
modes. Non-monotonic and monotonic suppression patterns are two typical forms
in the transition from order to disorder. Only relying on onsite potential
energy, not only we have obtained a profound understanding of the connection
and difference between order and disorder, but also developed a general
strategy to achieve both robustness and adjustability of the skin modes. By
linking with the scaling theory in disorder, the controllable suppression of
NHSEs, based on mutual transformation between order and disorder, is
generalized to higher dimensions.

<h3>Polarization textures in crystal supercells with topological bands</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16919" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16919</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wojciech J. Jankowski, Daniel Bennett, Aneesh Agarwal, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager</i>
<p>Two-dimensional materials are a highly tunable platform for studying the
momentum space topology of the electronic wavefunctions and real space topology
in terms of skyrmions, merons, and vortices of an order parameter. Such
textures for electronic polarization can exist in moir\'e heterostructures. A
quantum-mechanical definition of local polarization textures in insulating
supercells was recently proposed. Here, we propose a definition for local
polarization that is also valid for systems with topologically non-trivial
bands. We introduce semilocal hybrid polarizations, which are valid even when
the Wannier functions in a system cannot be made exponentially localized in all
dimensions. We use this definition to explicitly show that nontrivial
real-space polarization textures can exist in topologically non-trivial systems
with non-zero Chern number under (1) an external superlattice potential, and
(2) under a stacking-induced moir\'e potential. In the latter, we find that
while the magnitude of the local polarization decreases discontinuously across
a topological phase transition from trivial to topologically nontrivial, the
polarization does not completely vanish. Our findings suggest that band
topology and real-space polar topology may coexist in real materials.

<h3>Superdiffusive transport on lattices with nodal impurities</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16927" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16927</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yu-Peng Wang, Jie Ren, Chen Fang</i>
<p>We show that 1D lattice models exhibit superdiffusive transport in the
presence of random "nodal impurities" in the absence of interaction. Here a
nodal impurity is defined as a localized state, the wave function of which has
zeros (nodes) in momentum space. The dynamics exponent $z$, a defining quantity
for transport behaviors, is computed to establish this result. To be specific,
in a disordered system having only nodal impurities, the dynamical exponent
$z=4n/(4n-1)$ where $n$ is the order of the node. If the system has time
reversal, the nodes appear in pairs and the dynamical exponent can be enhanced
to $z=8n/(8n-1)$. As $1<z<2$, both cases indicate superdiffusive transport.

<h3>Disentangling spin excitation continua in classical and quantum magnets  using 2D nonlinear spectroscopy</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16935" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16935</a>
<br>
</p><i>Emily Z. Zhang, Ciar√°n Hickey, Yong Baek Kim</i>
<p>Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary
methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a
continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum
spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability
to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua
arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or
classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy
(2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics,
offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral
features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD)
techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant
Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure
Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp
line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and
in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $K\Gamma\Gamma'$ model, we show
that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from
that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad
continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of
classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance
of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates
the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous
spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics
in these frustrated systems.

<h3>No bulk thermal currents in massive Dirac fermions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16937</a>
<br>
</p><i>Feng Liu, A. Daria Dumitriu-I., Alessandro Principi</i>
<p>We calculate the energy current flowing in the bulk of a (2+1)-dimensional
system of massive Dirac fermions and along a (1+1)-dimensional domain wall
generated by flipping the sign of the particle mass. We show that, at low
temperatures and in the long-wavelenghth limit, the system does not support a
bulk thermal Hall current proportional to the temperature gradient. The only
such contribution is due to states localised at the domain wall. This puts an
end to a controversy existing in the literature and amends previous results
obtained via first-order perturbation calculations.

<h3>Universal fragmentation in annihilation reactions with constrained  kinetics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16950" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16950</a>
<br>
</p><i>Enrique Rozas Garcia, Alfred Weddig Karlsson, Johannes Hofmann</i>
<p>In reaction-diffusion models of annihilation reactions in low dimensions,
single-particle dynamics provides a bottleneck for reactions, leading to an
anomalously slow approach to the empty state. Here, we construct a reaction
model with a reciprocal bottleneck on particle dynamics where single-particle
motion conserves the center of mass. We show that such a constrained
reaction-diffusion dynamics does not approach an empty state but freezes at
late times in a state with fragmented particle clusters, and that the late-time
dynamics and asymptotic density are universal. Our setup thus constitutes a
minimal model for the fragmentation of a one-dimensional lattice into
independent particle clusters, and we provide exact results for the final
density in the large-reaction rate limit. We suggest that the universal
reaction dynamics could be observable in experiments with cold atoms or in the
Auger recombination of exciton gases.

<h3>Entropy production of run-and-tumble particles</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Matteo Paoluzzi, Andrea Puglisi, Luca Angelani</i>
<p>We analyze the entropy production in run-and-tumble models. After presenting
the general formalism in the framework of the Fokker-Planck equations in one
space dimension, we derive some known exact results in simple physical
situations (free run-and-tumble particles and harmonic confinement). We then
extend the calculation to the case of anisotropic motion (different speeds and
tumbling rates for right and left oriented particles), obtaining exact
expressions of the entropy production rate. We conclude by discussing the
general case of heterogeneous run-and-tumble motion described by
space-dependent parameters and extending the analysis to the case of
d-dimensional motions.

<h3>Superfluid--Bose-glass transition of disordered bosons with long-range  hopping in one dimension</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16959</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nicolas Dupuis</i>
<p>We study the superfluid--Bose-glass transition in a one-dimensional lattice
boson model with power-law decaying hopping amplitude $t_{i-j}\sim
1/|i-j|^\alpha$, using bosonization and the nonperturbative functional
renormalization group (FRG). When $\alpha$ is smaller than a critical value
$\alpha_c<3$, the U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken, which leads to a
density mode with nonlinear dispersion and dynamical exponent $z=(\alpha-1)/2$;
the superfluid phase is then stable for sufficiently weak disorder, contrary to
the case of short-range hopping where the superfluid phase is destabilized by
an infinitesimal disorder when the Luttinger parameter is smaller than $3/2$.
In the presence of disorder, long-range hopping has however no effect in the
infrared limit and the FRG flow eventually becomes similar to that of a boson
system with short-range hopping. This implies that the superfluid phase, when
stable, exhibits a density mode with linear dispersion ($z=1$) and the
superfluid--Bose-glass transition remains in the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, while the Bose-glass fixed
point is insensitive to long-range hopping. We compare our findings with a
recent numerical study.

<h3>PDMS elastic properties: influence of fabrication protocol and test  method</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16960</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hannah Varner, Tal Cohen</i>
<p>Silicone rubbers have been integral to the rapid development of microfluidic
devices and flexible electronics in recent decades. Polydimethylsiloxane,
commonly abbreviated as PDMS and produced using the brand name Dow SYLGARD 184,
is a ubiquitous such rubber that is renowned for its ease of manufacturing and
biocompatibility. SYLGARD 184 is a soft polymer frequently used in the field of
mechanics, microfluidics, and electronics given the straightforward ability to
manipulate its material properties via tuning base to curing agent mix ratios
and curing schedules. However, this tuning process largely occurs on a case by
case basis via trial and error, without a comprehensive understanding of how
composition, temperature, or mechanical test method my alter the measured
elasticity. Here we compare the reported elastic response of PDMS SYLGARD 184
obtained using a range of mechanical testing methods and compositions to
investigate the variability. We also include previously unreported experimental
results obtained in our lab using Volume Controlled Cavitation Expansion
(VCCE). Both testing method and cure schedule (time and temperature of curing)
are found to strongly influence the measured elastic response resulting in
shear moduli that range over 3 orders of magnitude for chemical compositions
that are reported to be the same. While tension testing is a common test method
in mechanical analysis, the wide ranging moduli for stiff PDMS and complete
inability to measure softer PDMS compositions reveal the limits of this
standard method. As researchers in the field of mechanics strive to quantify
the properties of increasingly complex biological and composite materials,
converging on a standardized measurement of PDMS is necessary, and is a
necessary first step for the community.

<h3>Hall response in interacting bosonic and fermionic ladders</h3>

<br>
</p><i>R. Citro, T. Giamarchi, E. Orignac</i>
<p>We use bosonization, retaining band curvature terms, to analyze the Hall
response of interacting bosonic and fermionic two-leg ladders threaded by a
flux. We derive an explicit expression of the Hall imbalance in a perturbative
expansion in the band curvature, retaining fully the interactions. We show that
the flux dependence of the Hall imbalance allows to distinguish the two phases
(Meissner and Vortex) that are present for a bosonic ladder. For small magnetic
field we relate the Hall resistance, both for bosonic and fermionic ladders, to
the density dependence of the charge sitffness of the system in absence of
flux. Our expression unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior in the
Galilean invariant case.

<h3>Experimental evidence for the $œâ^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectra  of glasses</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16996</a>
<br>
</p><i>Avraham Moriel, Edan Lerner, Eran Bouchbinder</i>
<p>It is now established that glasses feature low-frequency, nonphononic
excitations, in addition to phonons that follow Debye's vibrational density of
state (VDoS). Extensive computer studies demonstrated that these nonphononic,
glassy excitations follow a universal non-Debye VDoS ${\cal D}_{\rm
G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$, at low frequencies $\omega$. Yet, due to intrinsic
difficulties in disentangling ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the total VDoS
${\cal D}(\omega)$, which is experimentally accessible through various
scattering techniques, the $\omega^4$ tail of ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ lacked
direct experimental support. We develop a procedure to extract ${\cal D}_{\rm
G}(\omega)$ from the measured ${\cal D}(\omega)$, based on recent advances in
understanding low-frequency excitations in glasses, and apply it to available
datasets for diverse glasses. The resulting analysis shows that the $\omega^4$
tail of the nonphononic vibrational spectra of glasses is nontrivially
consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. It also further
supports that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ makes an additive contribution to
${\cal D}(\omega)$.

<h3>Giant microwave absorption in the vortex lattice in $s$-wave  superconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16998" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16998</a>
<br>
</p><i>T. Liu, M. Smith, A. V. Andreev, B. Z. Spivak</i>
<p>In this article we study microwave absorption in superconductors in the
presence of a vortex lattice. We show that in addition to the conventional
absorption mechanism associated with the vortex core motion, there is another
mechanism of microwave absorption, which is caused by the time-dependence of
the quasiparticle density of states outside the vortex cores. This mechanism
exists even in the absence of vortex motion and provides the dominant
contribution to microwave absorption in a broad interval of physical
parameters. At low frequencies, the dissipative part of the microwave
conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ is proportional to the inelastic relaxation time,
$\tau_{\mathrm{in}}$, which is typically much larger than the elastic
relaxation time, $\tau_{\mathrm{el}}$. At high frequencies $\sigma(\omega)$ is
proportional to the quasiparticle diffusion time across the inter-vortex
distance, $\tau_{\mathrm D}$, which is still larger than $\tau_{\mathrm{el}}$.

<h3>Higgs Phases and Boundary Criticality</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17001" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17001</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kristian Tyn Kai Chung, Rafael Flores-Calder√≥n, Rafael C. Torres, Pedro Ribeiro, Sergej Moroz, Paul McClarty</i>
<p>Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected
topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and
global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of
a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a
Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the
boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the
system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this
symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of
gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we
demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class
separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling
while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase
transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and
group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global
symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For
SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary
phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for
$N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal
chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this
mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the
higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break,
exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the
electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect
condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and
extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between
Higgs and SPT phases.

<h3>100+ years of colossal confusion on colloidal coagulation. Part I:  Smoluchowski's work on absorbing boundaries</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17021</a>
<br>
</p><i>K. Razi Naqvi</i>
<p>A report by Brillouin (from Perrin's laboratory) on the rate of adsorption of
`granules' to a glass plate [\textit{Ann. Chim. Phys.} 27 (1912) 412--23]
prompted Marian von Smoluchowski (MvS) to interpret the data in terms of his
newly developed theory of restricted Brownian motion. Placing an adsorbing wall
at $x=0$, he modelled the particle concentration $n(x,t)$ as that solution of
the diffusion equation which vanished at the wall, a boundary condition (BC)
hereafter called SBC. A gaping discrepancy between his theory and Brillouin's
data elicited a suggestion from MvS (that a particle might not adhere to the
wall on every impact), but no further action -- other than that of applying his
theory to spherically symmtric systems. In a paper written before, but
published shortly after MvS's untimely death [\textit{Proc. Roy. Acad. Amst.}
20 (1918) 642--58], H. C. Burger erected a new and sturdier framework, which
led him to an alternative BC, $D(\partial n/\partial x)_{x=0}=\varkappa
n(0,t)$, applicable to a surface with an arbitrary absorption probability
($1\leq\varepsilon\leq 0$); a fallacy (that subsequently claimed more victims,
including the present author) prevented him from deducing the correct
expression for $\varkappa$. Burger's approach became ``The Road Not Taken'',
while the SBC became the cornerstone of colloidal coagulation and bimoleculer
reaction kinetics. Burger's approach (but not the ABC) was partly rediscovered
by Kolmogorov, and used by Sveshnikov and Fuchs.The emended version of Burger's
BC is shown here to coincide with that deduced from the Klein-Kramers equation
[\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{49} (1982) 304--07; \textit{J. Chem. Phys.}
\textbf{78} (1983) 2710--12] and the Lorentz model of random flights

<h3>Enzymatic Aggregation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026</a>
<br>
</p><i>P. L. Krapivsky, S. Redner</i>
<p>We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which
two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third
"enzymatic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction
partners. The enzyme is unaffected by the joining event and is available to
either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to
mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of
life. We solve the kinetics of enzymatic aggregation in the model with
mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as
$t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as
$t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and
$t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to
mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters
can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.

<h3>Investigating the effect of particle size distribution and complex  exchange dynamics on NMR spectra of ions diffusing in disordered porous  carbons through a mesoscopic model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17054</a>
<br>
</p><i>El Hassane Lahrar, C√©line Merlet</i>
<p>Ion adsorption and dynamics in porous carbons is crucial for many
technologies such as energy storage and desalination. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key method to investigate such systems thanks
to the possibility to distinguish adsorbed (in-pore) and bulk (ex-pore) species
in the spectra. However, the large variety of magnetic environments experienced
by the ions adsorbed in the particles and the existence of dynamic exchange
between the inside of the particles and the bulk renders the intepretation of
the NMR experiments very complex. In this work, we optimise and apply a
mesoscopic model to simulate NMR spectra of ions in systems where carbon
particles of different sizes can be considered. We demonstrate that even for
monodisperse systems, complex NMR spectra, with broad and narrow peaks, can be
observed. We then show that the inclusion of polydispersity is essential to
recover some experimentally observed features, such as the co-existence of
peaks assigned to in-pore, exchange and bulk. Indeed, the variety of exchange
rates between in-pore and ex-pore environments, present in experiments but not
taken into account in analytical models, is necessary to reproduce the
complexity of experimental NMR spectra.

<h3>Exchange Interactions in Rare-earth Magnets $A_2$PrO$_3$ ($A$= alkali  metals): Revisited</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17058" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17058</a>
<br>
</p><i>Seong-Hoon Jang, Yukitoshi Motome</i>
<p>Rare-earth materials hold promise to realize exotic magnetic states owing to
synergy between electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling. Recently,
quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnets $A_2$PrO$_3$ ($A$ = alkali metals) were
predicted to be good candidates for Kitaev quantum spin liquids, as the
Kitaev-type bond-dependent anisotropic interactions dominate over
bond-independent isotropic Heisenberg ones. However, experimental observations
are negative, questioning the energy hierarchy in Pr$^{4+}$ ions assumed in the
conjecture on the basis of the conventional Russell-Saunders coupling scheme.
We here revisit the exchange interactions in these Pr compounds, by explicitly
taking into account the ionic states beyond the assumption. We show that, while
increasing the octahedral crystal field splitting, which was assumed to be
negligibly small, relative to the spin-orbit coupling, the Kitaev-type
interactions are suppressed to be subdominant compared to prevailing Heisenberg
ones. Our finding compromises the contradiction as arising from the peculiar
ionic state of the high valence Pr$^{4+}$.

<h3>Ultrafast spin dynamics: role of laser-induced modification of exchange  parameters</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17066" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17066</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sergiy Mankovsky, Svitlana Polesya, Hubert Ebert</i>
<p>Induced by an ultra-short laser pulse, the electronic structure of a material
undergoes strong modifications leading to a fast demagnetization in magnetic
materials. Induced spin-flip transitions are one of the reasons for
demagnetization, that is discussed in the literature as a Stoner-like
mechanism. On the other hand, demagnetization due to transverse spin
fluctuations is usually discussed on the basis of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian
and hardly accounts for the modification of the electronic structure. In this
work we demonstrate a strong impact of the laser-induced electron transitions,
both spin-flip and spin-conserving, on the exchange coupling parameters. For
this, a simple two-step scheme is suggested. As a first step, the electronic
structure time evolution during the ultra-short laser pulse is described
accurately within time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT)
calculations. As a next step, the information on the time-dependent electronic
structure is used for calculations of the parameters of the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian. A strong modification of the exchange coupling parameters is found
in response to the applied ultra-short laser pulse. The most important reason
for this modification is played by the laser induced repopulation of the
electronic states. Although the changes of the exchange parameters are most
prominent during the laser pulse, they may be important also for the magnetic
relaxation. The same concerns the spin-lattice interactions playing a central
role for the relaxation process. A strong impact of the laser-induced
modification of the electronic structure on the spin-lattice coupling
parameters is also shown in this work.

<h3>Supercurrent Diode Effect in Helical Superconductors</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jaglul Hasan, Daniel Shaffer, Maxim Khodas, Alex Levchenko</i>
<p>In this work, we explore the generalities of the supercurrent diode effect.
As an illustrative example, we examine a model of a two-dimensional
superconductor with Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling under an in-plane magnetic
field and in the clean limit, which realizes a helical phase. First, we utilize
Ginzburg-Landau phenomenology to derive a general formula for the diode
efficiency. This is achieved by incorporating higher gradient terms in the
Lifshitz invariants, which are responsible for the nonreciprocal superflow.
Subsequently, we validate these results through microscopic diagrammatic
computation and further estimate correction terms arising from interband
pairing correlations. We provide a detailed comparison to prior investigations
of this problem conducted within the framework of the quasiclassical
approximation based on the Eilenberger equation.

<p>The manipulation of edge configurations and structures in atomically thin
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for versatile functionalization has
attracted intensive interest in recent years. The chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) approach has shown promise for TMD edge engineering of atomic edge
configurations (1H, 1T or 1T'-zigzag or armchair edges), as well as diverse
edge morphologies (1D nanoribbons, 2D dendrites, 3D spirals, etc). These
rich-edge TMD layers offer versatile candidates for probing the physical and
chemical properties, and exploring new applications in electronics,
optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing and quantum field. In this review, we
present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the manipulation of TMD

unique properties associated with these edge configurations and structures and
provide insights into the opportunities afforded by such edge-functionalized
crystals. The objective of this review is to motivate further research and
development efforts in using CVD as a scalable approach to harness the benefits
of such crystal-edge engineering.

<h3>On the equivalence of the semiclassical theory and the response theory</h3>

<p>It is long believed that the response theory can give quantum correction (or
interband coherent effects) to the semiclassical theory, while both
formulations essentially are perturbatively solving the time-dependent
Sch\"odinger equation in a periodic potential probed by the electric field
within the independent-particle approximation. In this work, by extending the
semiclassical theory under a uniform electric field to the nonlinear AC regime,
we show explicitly that up to the second order of the electric field, the AC
semiclassical theory gives exactly the same results as the response theory in
the absence of relaxation. Remarkably, this equivalence can be expected even in
DC limit when the zero-frequency divergence is regulated on the same footing.
Particularly, at the linear order of the electric field, we show that both
formulations deliver the same Drude current, intrinsic anomalous Hall current,
and the displacement current, where the last one arising from the time
variation of the first-order \textit{positional shift} can only appear in AC
transport and is usually overlooked. Furthermore, at the second order of the
electric field, we show that all the well-known transport effects, including
the nonlinear Drude and Hall effects (that can be driven by the Berry curvature
dipole or/and quantum metric dipole) can be derived by both formulations.
Additionally, we show that the nonlinear displacement current due to the time
variation of the second-order \textit{positional shift} and the nonlinear
intrinsic Ohmic current due to the second-order energy correction (which is
determined by the first-order \textit{positional shift}) in AC semiclassical
theory can also be obtained by response theory.

<p>In this letter, we use knowledge gained from our recent study to present a
technique for separation of nanoparticles such as exosomes, anticancer drugs,
and vaccines. The technique involves adding non-adsorptive polymers to a system
in which two types of nanoparticles with the same size and zeta potential are
dispersed. The different types of nanoparticles can be separated based on
differences in their hydrophobicities and softness of the polymer. Using the
non-additive Asakura-Oosawa theory and assuming a realistic model system, we
were able to separate the two types of the particles with the same size and
zeta potential in the model system.

<h3>Twisted Magnetic Van der Waals Bilayers: An Ideal Platform for  Altermagnetism</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17146" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17146</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yichen Liu, Junxi Yu, Cheng-Cheng Liu</i>
<p>We introduce a universal methodology for generating and manipulating
altermagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (MvdW) materials
through twisting. We find that a key in-plane 2-fold rotational operation can
be achieved in a twisted bilayer of any 2D MvdW material, which takes one of
all five 2D Bravais lattices, thereby inducing altermagnetism. By choosing the
constituent MvdW monolayer with specific symmetry, our approach can tailor
altermagnetism of any type, such as $d$-wave, $g$-wave, and $i$-wave.
Furthermore, the properties of our twisted altermagnetic materials can be
easily engineered. Taking a transition-metal oxyhalide VOBr as an example, we
find that by tuning the twist angle and Fermi level a giant spin Hall angle can
be obtained, much larger than the experimentally reported. This approach
establishes a general, robust, and adjustable platform to explore
altermagnetism, and provides a new efficient way to generate and manipulate the
spin current.

<h3>Excitonic response in TMD heterostructures from first-principles: impact  of stacking, twisting, and interlayer distance</h3>

<p>Van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides provide a unique platform to engineer optoelectronic devices
tuning their optical properties via stacking, twisting, or straining. Using ab
initio Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we predict the electronic and optical
(absorption and photoluminescence spectra) properties of MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ and
MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayers with different stacking and twisting. We
analyse the valley splitting and optical transitions, and explain the
enhancement or quenching of the inter- and intra-layer exciton states. Contrary
to established models, that focus on transitions near the high-symmetry point
K, our results include all possible transitions across the Brillouin Zone. This
result, for a twisted Se-based heterostructures, in an interlayer exciton with
significant electron density in both layers and a mixed intralayer exciton
distributed over both MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$. We propose that it should be
possible to produce an inverted order of the excitonic states in some
MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, where the energy of the intralayer WSe$_2$
exciton is lower than that in MoSe$_2$. We predict the variability of the
exciton peak positions ($\sim$100 meV) and the exciton radiative lifetimes,
from pico- to nano-seconds, and even micro-seconds in twisted bilayers. The
control of exciton energies and lifetimes paves the way towards applications in
quantum information technologies and optical sensing.

</p><i>Alexandre Gauthier, Jonathan A. Sobota, Nicolas Gauthier, Costel R. Rotundu, Zhi-Xun Shen, Patrick S. Kirchmann</i>
<p>Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has been the focus of intense interest over the past decade due
to its topological properties. Bi surfaces are known to form on Bi$_2$Se$_3$
upon exposure to atmosphere, but their electronic structure has not been
investigated. We report band structure measurements of such Bi surfaces using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Measured spectra can be well
explained by the band structure of a single bilayer of Bi on Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and
show that Bi surfaces consistently dominate the photoemission signal for air
exposure times of at least 1 hour. These results demonstrate that atmospheric
effects should be taken into consideration when identifying two-dimensional
transport channels, and when designing surface-sensitive measurements of
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, ideally limiting air exposure to no more than a few minutes.

<h3>Six magnetization plateau phases in a kagome antiferromagnet with  $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$-type distortion</h3>

</p><i>Kazu Bodaiji, Katsuhiro Morita, Yoshiyuki Fukumoto</i>
<p>A recently discovered kagome antiferromagnet
$\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ has attracted significant interest
due to its unique kagome lattice structure and magnetic properties. Two
separate studies have proposed distinct sets of exchange interaction parameters
for this compound. In this study, we investigate the ground state of the
spin-1/2 Heisenberg kagome model with three types of nearest-neighbor exchange
interactions under a magnetic field by exact diagonalization using the Lanczos
method. We reveal that clear magnetization plateaus at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3,
5/9, and 7/9 are present under both parameter sets, which are identified as
magnon crystal states based on their spin structures. Our findings suggest that
these plateaus could potentially be experimentally confirmed with magnetization
measurements on $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ under a magnetic
field of approximately 300 T. Due to the uncertainty in the exchange
interactions of $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$, we perform
additional calculations by varying these interactions. Consequently, we
discover additional plateau phases at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9, each
distinctly different from the magnon crystal states.

<p>In recent years, a type of topological semimetals (TSMs) that can host new
fermions with high-fold degeneracy has attracted considerable interest. Among
them, ones with chiral structrue particularly catch our attention. Such chiral
high-fold degenerate semimetals always have a larger topological charge and
longer Fermi arcs which bringing about some special properties. In this work,
we found 147 chiral materials with exotic fermions near Fermi level by
high-throughput calculation and screening. We selected some typical examples to
analyse its topological properties such as topological surface states (TSSs)
and Berry curvature. Our results are helpful to provide a promising platform
for exploring the physical properties of chiral fermions and application of
chiral TSMs.

<h3>Unveiling the Boson Peaks in Amorphous Phase-Change Materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17226" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17226</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jens Moesgaard, Tomoki Fujita, Shuai Wei</i>
<p>The Boson peak is a universal phenomenon in amorphous solids. It can be
observed as an anomalous contribution to the low-temperature heat capacity over
the Debye model. Amorphous phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te are a
family of poor glass formers with fast crystallization kinetics, being of
interest for phase-change memory applications. So far, whether Boson peaks
exist in PCMs is unknown and, if they do, their relevance to PCM properties is
unclear. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the pseudo-binary
compositions on the tie-line between Ge15Te85 and Ge15Sb85 from a few Kelvins
to the liquidus temperatures. Our results demonstrate the evidence of the
pronounced Boson peaks in heat capacity below 10 K in the amorphous phase of
all compositions. By fitting the data using the Debye model combined with the
Einstein model, we can extract the characteristic parameters of the Boson peaks
and attribute their origin to the excess vibrational modes of dynamic defects
in the amorphous solids. We find that these parameters correlate almost
linearly with the Sb-content of the alloys, despite the nonmonotonic behaviors
in glass forming abilities. A larger contribution of excess vibrational modes
correlates with a larger width of enthalpy relaxation below the glass
transition temperature Tg. In a broader context, we show that the correlations
of the characteristic parameters of the Boson peaks with Tg and kinetic
fragility, vary according to the type of bonding. Specifically, metallic
glasses and conventional covalent glasses exhibit distinct patterns of
dependence, whereas PCMs manifest characteristics that lie in between. A deeper
understanding of the Boson peaks in PCMs holds the promise to enable
predictions of material properties at higher temperatures based on features
observed in low-temperature heat capacity.

<p>We consider the vestigial phase with broken time-reversal symmetry above the
superconducting transition temperature of a two-component superconductor in two
spatial dimensions. We show that, in contrast to 3D, a vestigial phase is in
general allowed within Ginzburg-Landau theory. The vestigial phase occupies an
increasing temperature region if the parameters in the Ginzburg-Landau theory
gives a larger energy difference between the broken time reversal symmetry
phase and the other ordered phase.

<h3>Interpreting the power spectral density of a fluctuating colloidal  current</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Stuart F. Knowles, Eleanor K. R. Mackay, Alice L. Thorneywork</i>
<p>The transport of molecules through biological and synthetic nanopores is
governed by multiple stochastic processes that lead to noisy, fluctuating
currents. Disentangling the characteristics of different noise-generating
mechanisms is thus central to better understanding molecular transport at a
fundamental level. Here, we study current noise experimentally at the single
particle level by imaging colloidal particles driven through microfluidic
channels by a difference in fluid pressure. In this scenario, currents
fluctuate due to the random arrival times of particles into the channel and the
distribution of particle speeds within the channel. We find that this results
in a characteristic form of the power spectral density of the current, scaling
as ~f^0, at low frequencies and ~1/f^2 at high frequencies. To rationalise
these scalings, we extend a model for shot noise with a finite transit time,
borrowed from electronic circuit theory, to include the experimental
distribution of transit times and compare this model to the experimental
spectra. We find excellent agreement between the data and model across a range
of driving pressures within an advection-dominated regime, thereby establishing
concrete links between the power spectra scalings and underlying mechanisms for
this experimental system. This paves the way for establishing a more systematic
understanding of the links between features of power spectra and underlying
molecular mechanisms in driven systems.

<p>Identification of crystal structures is a crucial stage in the exploration of
novel functional materials. This procedure is usually time-consuming and can be
false-positive or false-negative. This necessitates a significant level of
expert proficiency in the field of crystallography and, especially, requires
deep experience in perovskite - related structures of hybrid perovskites. Our
work is devoted to the machine learning classification of structure types of
hybrid lead halides based on available X-ray diffraction data. Here, we
proposed a simple approach to quickly identify of dimensionality of inorganic
substructures, types of lead halide polyhedra connectivity and structure types
using common powder XRD data and ML - decision tree classification model. The
average accuracy of our ML algorithm in predicting the dimensionality of
inorganic substructure, type of connection of lead halide and inorganic
substructure topology by theoretically calculated XRD pattern among 14 most
common structure types reaches 0.86+-0.05, 0.827+-0.028 and 0.71+-0.05,
respectively. The validation of our decision tree classification ML model on
experimental XRD data shows the accuracies of 1.0 and 0.82 for the dimension
and structure type prediction. Thus, our approach can significantly simplify
and accelerate the interpretation of highly complicated XRD data for hybrid
lead halides.

<p>We analyze the general relation between canonical and grand canonical
ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We begin our discussion by deriving, with
an alternative approach, some standard results first obtained by Kac and
coworkers in the late 1970s. Then, motivated by the Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) of trapped gases with a fixed number of atoms, which is well described by
the canonical ensemble and by the recent groundbreaking experimental
realization of BEC with photons in a dye-filled optical micro-cavity under
genuine grand canonical conditions, we apply our formalism to a system of
non-interacting Bose particles confined in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. We
discuss in detail the mathematical origin of the inequivalence of ensembles
observed in the condensed phase, giving place to the so-called grand canonical
catastrophe of density fluctuations. We also provide explicit analytical
expressions for the internal energy and specific heat and compare them with
available experimental data. For these quantities, we show the equivalence of
ensembles in the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>On sequences of convex records in the plane</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17309" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17309</a>
<br>
</p><i>Claude Godr√®che, Jean-Marc Luck</i>
<p>Convex records have an appealing purely geometric definition. In a sequence
of $d$-dimensional data points, the $n$-th point is a convex record if it lies
outside the convex hull of all preceding points. We specifically focus on the
bivariate (i.e., two-dimensional) setting. For iid (independent and identically
distributed) points, we establish an identity relating the mean number
$\mean{R_n}$ of convex records up to time $n$ to the mean number $\mean{N_n}$
of vertices in the convex hull of the first $n$ points. By combining this
identity with extensive numerical simulations, we provide a comprehensive
overview of the statistics of convex records for various examples of iid data
points in the plane: uniform points in the square and in the disk, Gaussian
points and points with an isotropic power-law distribution. In all these cases,
the mean values and variances of $N_n$ and $R_n$ grow proportionally to each
other, resulting in finite limit Fano factors $F_N$ and $F_R$. We also consider
planar random walks, i.e., sequences of points with iid increments. For both
the Pearson walk in the continuum and the P\'olya walk on a lattice, we
characterise the growth of the mean number $\mean{R_n}$ of convex records and
demonstrate that the ratio $R_n/\mean{R_n}$ keeps fluctuating with a universal
limit distribution.

<h3>Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tadeusz Koszto≈Çowicz, Aldona Dutkiewicz, Katarzyna D. Lewandowska</i>
<p>The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with fractional time derivatives of at
most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of
diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property the
Cattaneo diffusion equation has been proposed. Compared to the ordinary
subdiffusion equation, the Cattaneo equation contains an additional time
derivative of order greater than one and less than or equal to two. The
fractional order of the additional derivative depends on the subdiffusion
exponent. We study a Cattaneo-type subdiffusion equation (CTSE) that differs
from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential
operator (AO) which may be independent of subdiffusion parameters. The AO
describes processes affecting ordinary subdiffusion. The equation is derived
combining the modified diffusive flux equation with the continuity equation. It
can also be obtained within the continuous time random walk model with the
waiting time distribution for the molecule to jump controlled by the kernel of
AO. As examples, the CTSEs with the additional Caputo fractional time
derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the
AO generated by a slowly varying function are considered. We discuss whether
the ordinary subdiffusion equation and CTSE provide qualitative differences in
the description of subdiffusion.

<p>We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in
superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples
display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and
supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this
behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length
scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain
size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find
$\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic
configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative
supercurrent flow.

<p>State tomography allows to characterize quantum states, and was recently
applied to reveal the dynamic magnetization state of a parametrically driven
magnet. The identification of non-classical states, such as squeezed states,
relies on a careful analysis of their emission and their distinction from
thermal and vacuum fluctuations. A technique allowing to detect equilibrium
magnetization fluctuations is a crucial first step in this regard. In this
Letter, we show that inductive magnon noise spectroscopy (iMNS) allows to
characterize the thermal magnetization fluctuations of a ferromagnetic thin
film in a broadband coplanar waveguide-based scheme. Relative to a cold
microwave background, the microwaves emitted by the equilibrium magnetization
fluctuations can be detected via spectrum analysis. We provide a comprehensive
picture of our microwave system by quantitatively modeling its response,
including the thermalizing influence of the cables. The model allows for direct
comparison to low-power broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements with
excellent agreement, corroborating the equilibrium character of the iMNS
measurement by probing the linear response of the equilibrium state. Our work
thus demonstrates broadband access to the equilibrium properties of
magnetization fluctuations using a purely inductive approach.

<p>The ability to rapidly evaluate materials properties through atomistic
simulation approaches is the foundation of many new artificial

depends on the availability of accurate descriptions of atomic bonding through
various forms of interatomic potentials. We present an efficient, robust

Explorer. APEX enables the rapid evolution of interatomic potential development
and optimization, which is of particular importance in fine-tuning new classes
of general AI-based foundation models to forms that are readily applicable to
impacting materials development. APEX is an open-source, extendable, and
cloud-native platform for material property calculations using a range of
atomistic simulation methodologies that effectively manages diverse
computational resources and is built upon user-friendly features including
automatic results visualization, web-based platforms and NoSQL database client.
It is designed for expert and non-specialist users, lowers the barrier to entry
for interdisciplinary research within the "AI for Materials" framework. We
describe the foundation and use of APEX, as well as provide an example of its
application to properties of titanium for a wide-range of bonding descriptions.

<p>Compared to the widely investigated crystalline polymorphs of gallium oxide
(Ga2O3), knowledge about its amorphous state is still limited. With the help of
a machine-learning interatomic potential, we conducted large-scale atomistic
simulations to investigate the glass transition and mechanical behavior of
amorphous Ga2O3 (a-Ga2O3). During the quenching simulations, amorphization of
gallium oxide melt is observed at ultrahigh cooling rates, including a distinct
glass transition. The final densities at room temperature have up to 4%
variance compared to experiments. The glass transition temperature is evaluated
to range from 1234 K to 1348 K at different cooling rates. Structural analysis
of the amorphous structure shows evident similarities in structural properties
between a-Ga2O3 and amorphous alumina (a-Al2O3), such as radial distribution
function, coordination distribution, and bond angle distribution. An amorphous
gallium oxide structure that contains approximately one million atoms is
prepared for the tension simulation. A highly plastic behavior is observed at
room temperature in the tension simulations, comparable to amorphous alumina.
With quantitative characterization methods, we show that a-Ga2O3 can possibly
has a higher nucleation rate of localized plastic strain events compared to
a-Al2O3, which can increase the material's resistance to shear banding
formation during deformation.

<p>Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that
may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and
biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able
to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical
properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method
entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine
learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To
ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including
those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of
the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts
global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern
transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and
data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model.
The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects
translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions
(i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale
in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars,
vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress
and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model
equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean
group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and
data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an
efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use
only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to
achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.

<h3>Magnetic domains in ultrathin, bulk-like and proximity-coupled Europium  Oxide</h3>

<p>The control of electron spins in materials that are simultaneously
ferromagnetic and insulating opens up a wealth of quantum phenomena in
spin-based electronics. Thin films of europium oxide (EuO) are ideal for the
generation and manipulation of spin-polarized states, but so far there are no
experimental literature reports on the magnetic domain patterns for EuO.
However, at these microscopic length scales, magnetic relaxation between the
remanent and demagnetized states takes place in any spintronic device. This
relaxation process involves displacements of magnetic domain walls and can
therefore be strongly influenced by the film structure and thickness. Here we
present an investigation of the temperature-dependent behavior of magnetic
domains and hysteresis in bulk-like (25 nm) and ultrathin (3 nm) EuO films.
Magneto-optical Kerr microscopy is used, a technique that is a valuable tool to
explore microscopic features such as spin dynamics and magnetic domain walls.
Significant Kerr rotation in EuO led to high-contrast magnetic domain images in
thick films, facilitating observation of domain dynamics. The critical
temperature (TC) and coercivity shows strong thickness-dependent variations.
The analysis and comparison of hysteresis loops and domain imaging in EuO and
EuO/Co reveal proximity effect-induced antiferromagnetic coupling of both
layers. To elucidate the magnetization reversal dynamics in EuO, micromagnetic
simulations using MuMax3 were performed below and above TC. This comprehensive
approach aims to comprehend the impact of magnetism and magnetic proximity
effect in EuO on the micromagnetic scale, potentially extending its magnetic
ordering beyond TC.

<h3>Nonreciprocal pair interactions and emergent activity mediated by  scattered waves</h3>

<p>Particles that scatter waves interact through the waves they scatter. Using
acoustically levitated spheres as a model system, we show that wave-mediated
pair interactions are nonreciprocal except under a limited set of
circumstances. This apparent violation of Newton's third law is allowed because
the pair of particles does not constitute a closed system; the sound wave
carries away the balance of the system's momentum and angular momentum. The
nonreciprocity of wave-mediated interactions is significant because it enables
collections of scatterers to transduce energy out of the wave and use it to
power their own motion. Such wave-matter composite systems display a form of
activity that is an emergent property of their state of organization. We
demonstrate emergent activity arising from nonreciprocal wave-mediated
interactions through experiments and simulations on trios of acoustically
levitated beads.

<h3>Ultrafast Optical Control of Exciton Diffusion in WSe$_2$/Graphene  Heterostructures Revealed by Heterodyne Transient Grating Spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Using heterodyne transient grating spectroscopy, we observe a significant
enhancement of exciton diffusion within a monolayer WSe$_2$ stacked on top of
graphene. We further demonstrate that the diffusion dynamics can be optically
tuned on the ultrafast time scale (i.e. a few picoseconds) by altering the
photoexcited charge carrier density in graphene. The results reveal that, on a
time scale of a few picoseconds, the effective diffusion constant in the
WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructure is approximately 40 cm$^2 $/s, representing a
substantial improvement over the 2 cm$^2 $/s typical for an isolated monolayer
of WSe$_2$. The enhanced diffusion can be understood in terms of a transient
screening of impurities, charge traps, and defect states in WSe$_2$ by
photoexcited charge carriers in graphene. Furthermore, we observe that the
diffusion within WSe$_2$ is affected by interlayer interactions, like charge
transfer, exhibiting different dynamic states depending on the incident
excitation fluence. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of screening
and diffusion processes in heterostructures of 2D semiconductors and graphene
and provide valuable insights for future applications of these systems in
ultrafast optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Weyl nodes in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ revealed by dynamical mean-field theory</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17425" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17425</a>
<br>
</p><i>Martin Bra√ü, Jan M. Tomczak, Karsten Held</i>
<p>Experimental studies have found unusual transport properties in
Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ which are potentially a consequence of the interplay between
band-structure topology and electronic correlations. Based on these
measurements, the existence of Weyl points in strongly renormalized, flat
quasiparticle bands has been postulated. However, so far, there has been
neither a direct spectroscopic observation of these, nor a calculation from
first principles that would confirm their existence close to the Fermi energy.
Here, we present density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT) calculations and study the low-energy excitations and their
topological properties. We find that the Kondo effect promotes two out of the
six angular momentum $J=5/2$ states, with the other four pushed to higher
energies. Further, we find Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy as previously
suggested for explaining the observed giant spontaneous Hall effect in
Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$, as well as nodal lines.

<h3>NH$_3$ adsorption and competition with H$_2$O on a hydroxylated  aluminosilicate surface</h3>

<p>The interaction between ammonia (NH$_3$) and (alumino)silicates is of
fundamental and applied importance, yet the specifics of NH$_3$ adsorption on
silicate surfaces remain largely unexplored, mainly because of experimental
challenges related to their electrically insulating nature. An example of this
knowledge gap is evident in the context of ice nucleation on silicate dust,
wherein the role of NH$_3$ for ice nucleation remains debated. This study
explores the fundamentals of the interaction between NH$_3$ and microcline
feldspar (KAlSi$_3$O$_8$), a common aluminosilicate with outstanding ice
nucleation abilities. Atomically resolved non-contact atomic force microscopy,
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory-based
calculations elucidate the adsorption geometry of NH$_3$ on the lowest-energy
surface of microcline, the (001) facet, and its interplay with surface
hydroxyls and molecular water. NH$_3$ and H$_2$O are found to adsorb
molecularly in the same adsorption sites, creating H-bonds with the proximate
surface silanol (Si-OH) and aluminol (Al-OH) groups. Despite the closely
matched adsorption energies of the two molecules, NH$_3$ readily yields to
replacement by H$_2$O, challenging the notion that ice nucleation on microcline
proceeds via the creation of an ordered H$_2$O layer atop pre-adsorbed NH$_3$
molecules.

<h3>From STEM-EDXS data to phase separation and quantification using  physics-guided NMF</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Adrien Teurtrie, Nathana√´l Perraudin, Thomas Holvoet, Hui Chen, Duncan T. L. Alexander, Guillaume Obozinski, C√©cile H√©bert</i>
<p>We present the development of a new algorithm which combines state-of-the-art
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy theory and a suitable machine
learning formulation for the hyperspectral unmixing of scanning transmission
electron microscope EDX spectrum images. The algorithm is based on non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) incorporating a physics-guided factorization model.
It optimizes a Poisson likelihood, under additional simplex constraint together
with user-chosen sparsity-inducing and smoothing regularizations, and is based
on iterative multiplicative updates. The fluorescence of X-rays is fully
modeled thanks to state-of-the-art theoretical work. It is shown that the
output of the algorithm can be used for a direct chemical quantification. With
this approach, it is straightforward to include a priori knowledge on the
specimen such as the presence or absence of certain chemical elements in some
of its phases. This work is implemented within two open-source Python packages,
espm and emtables, which are used here for data simulation, data analysis and
quantification. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that incorporating
physical modeling in the decomposition helps retrieve meaningful components
from spatially and spectrally mixed phases, even when the data are very noisy.
For synthetic data with a higher signal, the regularizations yield a tenfold
increase in the quality of the reconstructed abundance maps compared to
standard NMF. Our approach is further validated on experimental data with a
known ground truth, where state-of-the art results are achieved by using prior
knowledge about the sample. Our model can be generalized to any other scanning
spectroscopy techniques where underlying physical modeling can be linearized.

<h3>Relations between normal state nonreciprocal transport and the  superconducting diode effect in the trivial and topological phases</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Georg Angehrn, Henry F. Legg, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja</i>
<p>Nonreciprocal transport effects can occur in the normal state of conductors
and in superconductors when both inversion and time-reversal symmetry are
broken. Here, we consider systems where magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) of the
energy spectrum due to an externally applied magnetic field results in a
rectification effect in the normal state and a superconducting (SC) diode
effect when the system is proximitised by a superconductor. Focussing on
nanowire systems, we obtain analytic expressions for both normal state
rectification and SC diode effects that reveal the commonalities - as well as
differences - between these two phenomena. Furthermore, we consider the
nanowire brought into an (almost) helical state in the normal phase or a
topological superconducting phase when proximitised. In both cases this reveals
that the topology of the system considerably modifies its nonreciprocal
transport properties. Our results provide new insights into how to determine
the origin of nonreciprocal effects and further evince the strong connection of
nonreciprocal transport with the topological properties of a system.

<p>Lattice formation of swirling textures is ubiquitous in solid-state
materials, such as a magnetic skyrmion lattice in chiral magnets. In the
magnetic skyrmion lattices, their moving states and dynamics under external
perturbations are still unrevealed, although a detailed understanding of the
dynamics is crucial to realizing spintronic applications, such as magnetic
domain-wall racetrack memory. Here, we report in detail on the transient state
of a moving magnetic skyrmion lattice in bulk single-crystalline MnSi under
alternating current (AC) using small-angle neutron scattering. A rotation and
concomitant broadening of the spot width in the azimuthal direction of the
magnetic skyrmion reflections originating from the plastic deformation of the
magnetic skyrmion lattice were found only at low AC frequencies, whereas above
the threshold AC frequency (ft ~ 0.12 Hz) the rotation was not observed, and
the spot width becomes sharper. The observed complex response of the magnetic
skyrmion reflections can be explained by the change in dislocation density in
the magnetic skyrmion lattice. At frequencies higher than ft, the magnetic
skyrmions oscillate removing the dislocations, indicating that the dislocation
density is controlled by the AC frequency.

<h3>Multifold topological semimetals</h3>

</p><i>I√±igo Robredo, Niels Schr√∂eter, Claudia Felser, Jennifer Cano, Barry Bradlyn, Maia G. Vergniory</i>
<p>The discovery of topological semimetals with multifold band crossings has
opened up a new and exciting frontier in the field of topological physics.
These materials exhibit large Chern numbers, leading to long double Fermi arcs
on their surfaces, which are protected by either crystal symmetries or
topological order. The impact of these multifold crossings extends beyond
surface science, as they are not constrained by the Poincar\'e classification
of quasiparticles and only need to respect the crystal symmetry of one of the
1651 magnetic space groups. Consequently, we observe the emergence of free
fermionic excitations in solid-state systems that have no high-energy
counterparts, protected by non-symmorphic symmetries. In this work, we review
the recent theoretical and experimental progress made in the field of multifold
topological semimetals. We begin with the theoretical prediction of the
so-called multifold fermions and discuss the subsequent discoveries of chiral
and magnetic topological semimetals. Several experiments that have realized
chiral semimetals in spectroscopic measurements are described, and we discuss
the future prospects of this field. These exciting developments have the
potential to deepen our understanding of the fundamental properties of quantum
matter and inspire new technological applications in the future.

<h3>Ferrimagnetism of ultracold fermions in a multi-band Hubbard system</h3>

</p><i>Martin Lebrat, Anant Kale, Lev Haldar Kendrick, Muqing Xu, Youqi Gang, Alexander Nikolaenko, Subir Sachdev, Markus Greiner</i>
<p>Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are
crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate
materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum
interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise
to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on
signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling,
characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic
correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate its
robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to
the Heisenberg regime, and study its emergence when continuously tuning the
lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way
towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum
spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.

<br>
</p><i>Darren Pereira, Erich J. Mueller</i>
<p>Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the
associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum
dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We
calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting
fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we
find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch
dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead
find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize
to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product
state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.

<h3>Low-energy nine-layer rhombohedral stacking of transition metal  dichalcogenides</h3>

</p><i>Rijan Karkee, David A. Strubbe</i>
<p>Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show unique physical, optical, and
electronic properties. The known phases of TMDs are 2H and 3R in bulk form, 1T
and associated reconstructions, and 1H in monolayer form. This paper reports a
hypothetical phase, 9R, that may exist in TMDs (Mo, W)(S, Se, Te)$_2$, meeting
both dynamical stability and elastic stability criteria. 9R phase has the same
space group as 3R, $i.e.$ rhombohedral $R3m$ without inversion symmetry, and
has 9 layers in a conventional unit cell. We find that 9R has an energy within
1 meV per formula unit of 3R and can be energetically favored by a particular
strain condition. We further calculate the electronic, elastic, piezoelectric,
Raman, and second-harmonic generation signatures of 9R TMDs and compare them
with the corresponding 2H and 3R phases. 9R has similar properties to 3R but
shows distinctive Raman peaks in the low-frequency regime, improved
piezoelectric properties, and unique band splitting arising from layer coupling
at the conduction band minimum. These distinct properties make 9R an attractive
candidate for applications in piezotronics and valleytronics.

<h3>A tale of two localizations: coexistence of flat bands and Anderson  localization in a photonics-inspired amorphous system</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Elizabeth J. Dresselhaus, Alexander Avdoshkin, Zhetao Jia, Matteo Secli, Boubacar Kante, Joel E. Moore</i>
<p>Emerging experimental platforms use amorphousness, a constrained form of
disorder, to tailor meta-material properties. We study localization under this
type of disorder in a class of $2D$ models generalizing recent experiments on
photonic systems. We explore two kinds of localization that emerge in these
models: Anderson localization by disorder, and the existence of compact,
macroscopically degenerate localized states as in many crystalline flat bands.
We find localization properties to depend on the symmetry class within a family
of amorphized kagom\'{e} tight-binding models, set by a tunable synthetic
magnetic field. The flat-band-like degeneracy innate to kagom\'{e} lattices
survives under amorphousness without on-site disorder. This phenomenon arises
from the cooperation between the structure of the compact localized states and
the geometry of the amorphous graph. For particular values of the field, such
states emerge in the amorphous system that were not present on the kagom\'{e}
lattice in the same field. For generic states, the standard paradigm of
Anderson localization is found to apply as expected for systems with
particle-hole symmetry (class D), while a similar interpretation does not
extend to our results in the general unitary case (class A). The structure of
amorphous graphs, which arise in current photonics experiments, allows exact
statements about flat-band-like states, including such states that only exist
in amorphous systems, and demonstrates how the qualitative behavior of a
disordered system can be tuned at fixed graph topology.
