<h3>Phase Coexistence Implications of Violating Newton's Third Law</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03995" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03995</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Jen Chiu, Ahmad K. Omar</i>
<br>
<br>
Newton's third law, \textit{actio = reactio}, is a foundational statement of
classical mechanics. However, in natural and living systems, this law appears
to be routinely violated for constituents interacting in a nonequilibrium
environment. Here, we use computer simulations to explore the macroscopic phase
behavior implications of breaking microscopic interaction reciprocity for a
simple model system. We consider a binary mixture of attractive particles and
introduce a parameter which is a continuous measure of the degree to which
interaction reciprocity is broken. In the reciprocal limit, the species are
indistinguishable and the system phase separates into domains with distinct
densities and identical compositions. Increasing nonreciprocity is found to
drive the system to explore a rich assortment of phases, including phases with
strong composition asymmetries and three-phase coexistence. Many of the states
induced by these forces, including traveling crystals and liquids, have no
equilibrium analogue. By mapping the complete phase diagram for this model
system and characterizing these unique phases, our findings offer a concrete
path forward toward understanding how nonreciprocity shapes the structures
found in living systems and how this might be leveraged in synthetic materials.

<h3>Configurational Entropy of Self Propelled Glass Formers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04190" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04190</a>

The configurational entropy is an indispensable tool to describe super-cooled
liquids near the glass transition. Its calculation requires the enumeration of
the basins in the potential energy landscape and when available, it reveals a
direct connection with the relaxation time of the liquid. While there are
several reports on the measurement of configurational entropy in passive
liquids, very little is understood about its role in active liquids which have
a propensity to undergo a glass transition at low temperatures. In this paper,
we report a careful calculation of the configurational entropy in a model glass
former where the constituent units are self propelled. We show that unlike
passive liquids, the anharmonic contribution to the glass entropy in these
self-propelled liquids can be of the same order as the harmonic contribution,
and therefore must be included in the calculation of the configurational
entropy. Our extracted configurational entropy is in good agreement with the
generalized Adam-Gibbs relation predicted by the random first order transition
theory enabling us to deduce a scaling relation between the configurational
entropy and the point-to-set length scale in these active systems. Our results
could be of great utility to study self-propelled granular systems, active
Janus colloidal particles and bacterial suspension with passive tracers etc.

<h3>Electrocatalytic CO$_2$ Reduction: Role of the Cross-Talk at  Organic-Inorganic Interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04410</a>
<br>
<i>Michele Melchionna, Paolo Fornasiero, Maurizio Prato, Marcella Bonchio</i>
<br>
<br>
Electrocatalytic CO$_2$RR is an interfacial process, involving a minimum of
three phases at the contact point of gaseous CO$_2$ with the electrodic surface
and the liquid electrolyte. As a consequence, surface chemistry at composite
interfaces plays a central role for CO$_2$RR selectivity and catalysis. Each
interface defines a functional boundary, where active sites are exposed to a
unique environment with respect to distal sites in the bulk or organic and
inorganic materials. While the individual role of each component-type is hardly
predictable a-solo, the interface ensemble works via a strategic interplay of
individual effects, including: (i) enhanced electrical conductivity, (ii) high
surface area and exposure of the interfacial catalytic sites, (iii) favorable
transport and feeding of reactants, (iv) complementary interactions for the
on/off stabilization of cascade intermediates, (v) a secondary sphere
assistance to lower the activation energy of bottleneck steps, (vi) a
reinforced robustness and long-term operation stability by mutual protection
and/or healing mechanisms. Selected CO$_2$RR case studies are compared and
contrasted to highlight how the organic domains of carbon nanostructures merge
with metal and metal-oxide active sites to separate tasks but also to turn them
into a cooperative asset of mutual interactions, thus going beyond the classic
Divide et Impera rule.

<h3>Abelian combinatorial gauge symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03880</a>
<br>
<i>Hongji Yu, Garry Goldstein, Dmitry Green, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Claudio Chamon</i>
<br>
<br>
Combinatorial gauge symmetry is a novel principle that allows us to construct
lattice gauge theories with two key and distinguishing properties: (a) the
construction only requires one- and two-body interactions; and (b) the symmetry
is exact rather than emergent in an effective or perturbative limit. Systems
with these properties can feature topologically ordered ground states for a
range of parameters. This paper presents a generalization of combinatorial
gauge symmetry to any finite Abelian group. Apart from the general mathematical
construction, we present a physical implementation in superconducting wire
arrays, which offers a route to the experimental realization of lattice gauge
theories with static Hamiltonians.

<h3>Prethermal fragmentation in a periodically driven Fermionic chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03892" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03892</a>
<br>
<i>Somsubhra Ghosh, Indranil Paul, K. Sengupta</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a Fermionic chain with nearest-neighbor hopping and density-density
interactions, where the nearest-neighbor interaction term is driven
periodically. We show that such a driven chain exhibits prethermal strong
Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in the high drive amplitude regime at
specific drive frequencies $\omega_m^{\ast}$. This constitutes the first
realization of HSF for out-of-equilibrium systems. We obtain analytic
expressions of $\omega_m^{\ast}$ using a Floquet perturbation theory and
provide exact numerical computation of entanglement entropy, equal-time
correlation functions, and the density autocorrelation of Fermions for finite
chains. All of these quantities indicate clear signatures of strong HSF. We
study the fate of the HSF as one tunes away from $\omega_m^{\ast}$ and discuss
the extent of the prethermal regime as a function of the drive amplitude.

<h3>Effects of the antiferrodistortive instability on the structural  behavior of BaZrO$_3$ by atomistic simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03924</a>
<br>
<i>M. Sepliarsky, R. Machado, S. Tinte, M. G. Stachiotti</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, the possibility of a low-temperature non-cubic phase in BaZrO$_3$
has generated engaging discussions about its true ground state and the
consequences on its physical properties. In this paper, we investigate the
microscopic behavior of the BaZrO$_3$ cubic phase by developing a shell model
from $ab~initio$ calculations and by performing molecular dynamics simulations
at finite temperature and under negative pressure. We study three different
scenarios created by tuning the intensities of the antiferrodistortive (AFD)
instabilities, and consequently, the sequence of phase transitions with
temperature. From a detailed analysis of the cubic phase at atomic scale, we
find that oxygen octahedra are barely distorted, present rotation angles that
may oscillate with significant amplitudes, are AFD correlated with their
closest neighbors on the plane perpendicular to the pseudocubic rotation axis
exhibiting $(0 0 a^-)$-type ordering, and form instantaneous, dynamic and
unstable domains over time. Our simulations support the existence of
nanoregions with short-range ordering in cubic BaZrO$_3$ associated with
experimentally observed anomalies and unveil that they can exist regardless of
whether or not structural phase transitions related with AFD distortions occur
at lower temperatures.

<h3>Symmetry-based computational search for novel binary and ternary 2D  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03975" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03975</a>
<br>
<i>Hai-Chen Wang, Jonathan Schmidt, Miguel A.L. Marques, Ludger Wirtz, Aldo H. Romero</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a symmetry-based exhaustive approach to explore the structural and
compositional richness of two-dimensional materials. We use a ``combinatorial
engine'' that constructs potential compounds by occupying all possible Wyckoff
positions for a certain space group with combinations of chemical elements.
These combinations are restricted by imposing charge neutrality and the Pauling
test for electronegativities. The structures are then pre-optimized with a
specially crafted universal neural-network force-field, before a final step of
geometry optimization using density-functional theory is performed. In this way
we unveil an unprecedented variety of two-dimensional materials, covering the
whole periodic table in more than 30 different stoichiometries of form
A$_n$B$_m$ or A$_n$B$_m$C$_k$. Among the found structures we find examples that
can be built by decorating nearly all Platonic and Archimedean tesselations as
well as their dual Laves or Catalan tilings. We also obtain a rich, and
unexpected, polymorphism for some specific compounds. We further accelerate the
exploration of the chemical space of two-dimensional materials by employing
machine-learning-accelerated prototype search, based on the structural types
discovered in the exhaustive search. In total, we obtain around 6500 compounds,
not present in previous available databases of 2D materials, with an energy of
less than 250~meV/atom above the convex hull of thermodynamic stability.

<h3>Elucidation of Relaxation Dynamics Beyond Equilibrium Through  AI-informed X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03984" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03984</a>

<br>
Understanding and interpreting dynamics of functional materials \textit{in
situ} is a grand challenge in physics and materials science due to the
difficulty of experimentally probing materials at varied length and time
scales. X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) is uniquely well-suited
for characterizing materials dynamics over wide-ranging time scales, however
spatial and temporal heterogeneity in material behavior can make interpretation
of experimental XPCS data difficult. In this work we have developed an
unsupervised deep learning (DL) framework for automated classification and
interpretation of relaxation dynamics from experimental data without requiring
any prior physical knowledge of the system behavior. We demonstrate how this
method can be used to rapidly explore large datasets to identify samples of
interest, and we apply this approach to directly correlate bulk properties of a
model system to microscopic dynamics. Importantly, this DL framework is
material and process agnostic, marking a concrete step towards autonomous
materials discovery.

<h3>Constant Chemical Potential-Quantum Mechanical-Molecular Dynamics  simulations of the Graphene-electrolyte double layer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03990" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03990</a>
<br>
<i>Nicodemo Di Pasquale, Aaron R. Finney, Joshua Elliott, Paola Carbone, Matteo Salvalaglio</i>
<br>
<br>
We present the coupling of two frameworks -- the pseudo-open boundary
simulation method known as constant potential Molecular Dynamics simulations
(C$\mu$MD), combined with QMMD calculations -- to describe the properties of
graphene electrodes in contact with electrolytes. The resulting C$\mu$QMMD
model was then applied to three ionic solutions (LiCl, NaCl and KCl in water)
at bulk solution concentrations ranging from 0.5 M up to 6 M in contact with a
charged graphene electrode. The new approach we are describing here provides a
simulation protocol to control the concentration of the electrolyte solutions
while including the effects of a fully polarizable electrode surface. Thanks to
this coupling, we are able to accurately model both the electrode and solution
side of the double layer and provide a thorough analysis of the properties of
electrolytes at charged interfaces, such as the screening ability of the
electrolyte and the electrostatic potential profile. We also report the
calculation of the integral electrochemical double layer capacitance in the
whole range of concentrations analysed for each ionic species, while the QM
simulations provide access to the differential and integral quantum
capacitance. We highlight how subtle features, such as the adsorption of
potassium at the interface or the tendency of the ions to form clusters, emerge
from our simulations, contribute to explaining the ability of graphene to store
charge and suggest implications for desalination.

<h3>Controlling crystallization: What liquid structure and dynamics reveal  about crystal nucleation mechanisms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03996</a>
<br>
<i>Jutta Rogal, Grisell Díaz Leines</i>
<br>
<br>
Over recent years, molecular simulations have provided invaluable insights
into the microscopic processes governing the initial stages of crystal
nucleation and growth. A key aspect that has been observed in many different
systems is the formation of precursors in the supercooled liquid that precedes
the emergence of crystalline nuclei. The structural and dynamical properties of
these precursors determine to a large extend the nucleation probability as well
as the formation of specific polymorphs. This novel microscopic view on
nucleation mechanisms has further implications for our understanding of the
nucleating ability and polymorph selectivity of nucleating agents, as these
appear to be strongly linked to their ability in modifying structural and
dynamical characteristics of the supercooled liquid, namely liquid
heterogeneity. In this perspective, we highlight recent progress in exploring
the connection between liquid heterogeneity and crystallization, including the
effects of templates, and the potential impact for controlling crystallization
processes.

<h3>Rigidity percolation in a random tensegrity via analytic graph theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04004</a>
<br>
<i>William Stephenson, Vishal Sudhaker, James McInerney, Michael Czajkowski, D. Zeb Rocklin</i>
<br>
<br>
Functional structures from across the engineered and biological world combine
rigid elements such as bones and columns with flexible ones such as cables,
fibers and membranes. These structures are known loosely as tensegrities, since
these cable-like elements have the highly nonlinear property of supporting only
extensile tension. Marginally rigid systems are of particular interest because
the number of structural constraints permits both flexible deformation and the
support of external loads. We present a model system in which tensegrity
elements are added at random to a regular backbone. This system can be solved
analytically via a directed graph theory, revealing a novel mechanical critical
point generalizing that of Maxwell. We show that even the addition of a few
cable-like elements fundamentally modifies the nature of this transition point,
as well as the later transition to a fully rigid structure. Moreover, the
tensegrity network displays a fundamentally new collective avalanche behavior,
in which the addition of a single cable leads to the elimination of multiple
floppy modes, a phenomenon that becomes dominant at the transition point. These
phenomena have implications for systems with nonlinear mechanical constraints,
from biopolymer networks to soft robots to jammed packings to origami sheets.

<h3>Partial osmotic pressures of ions in electrolyte solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04006" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04006</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick B. Warren</i>
<br>
<br>
The concept of the partial osmotic pressure of ions in an electrolyte
solution is critically examined. In principle these can be defined by
introducing a solvent-permeable wall and measuring the force per unit area
which can certainly be attributed to individual ions. Here I demonstrate that
although the total wall force balances the bulk osmotic pressure as required by
mechanical equilibrium, the individual partial osmotic pressures are
extra-thermodynamic quantities dependent on the electrical structure at the
wall, and as such they resemble attempts to define individual ion activity
coefficients. The limiting case where the wall is a barrier to only one species
of ion is also considered, and with ions on both sides the classic Gibbs-Donnan
membrane equilibrium is recovered thus providing a unifying treatment. The
analysis can be extended to illustrate how the electrical state of the bulk is
affected by the nature of the walls and the sample handling history, thus
supporting the 'Gibbs-Guggenheim uncertainty principle' (the notion that the
electrical state is unmeasurable and usually accidentally determined). Since
this uncertainty is conferred also onto individual ion activities, it has
implications for the current (2002) IUPAC definition of pH.

<h3>Dynamic generation of spin spirals of moiré trapped carriers via  exciton mediated spin interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04021</a>
<br>
<i>Chengxin Xiao, Yong Wang, Wang Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
Stacking transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to form moir\'e
superlattices has provided exciting opportunities to explore many-body
correlation phenomena of the moir\'e trapped carriers. TMDs bilayers, on the
other hand, host long-lived interlayer exciton (IX), an elementary excitation
of long spin-valley lifetime that can be optically or electrically injected.
Here we find that, through the Coulomb exchange between mobile IXs and
carriers, the IX bath can mediate both Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
type spin interactions between moir\'e trapped carriers, controllable by
exciton density and exciton spin current respectively. We show the strong
Heisenberg interaction, and the extraordinarily long-ranged
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction here can jointly establish robust spin spiral
magnetic orders in Mott-Wigner crystal states at various filling factors, with
spiral direction controlled by exciton current.

<h3>Strain Engineering on the Excitonic Properties of Monolayer GaSe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04023" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04023</a>
<br>
<i>Vo Khuong Dien, Nguyen Thi Han, Ming-Fa Lin</i>
<br>
<br>
This paper investigates strain effects on the electronic and optical
properties of monolayer GaSe using first-principles calculations. The
deformation significantly alters energy dispersion, band gap, and the band edge
states of GaSe. The band gap evolution exhibits both linearly and nonlinearly
with the strains, and strongly depending on the types of deformation and the
direction of the modifications. The external mechanical strains also
significantly tailor the optical properties of GaSe, the exciton binding energy
is strongly reduced when the tensile strain is applied, while the opposite way
is true for compressive stress. Moreover, the inhomogeneous strain also induces
strong polarization in the absorption spectra. Our calculations demonstrate
that the electronic and optical properties of GaSe monolayer can be
significantly tuned by using strain engineering which appears as a promising
way to design novel optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Acoustic-Driven Magnetic Skyrmion Motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04049</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Yang, Le Zhao, Di Yi, Teng Xu, Yahong Chai, Chenye Zhang, Dingsong Jiang, Yahui Ji, Wanjun Jiang, Jianshi Tang, Pu Yu, Huaqiang Wu, Tianxiang Nan</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions have great potential for developing novel spintronic
devices. The electrical manipulation of skyrmions has mainly relied on
current-induced spin-orbit torques. A recent theoretical model suggested that
the skyrmions could be more efficiently manipulated by surface acoustic waves
(SAW), an elastic wave that can couple with magnetic moment through
magnetoelastic effect. However, the directional motion of skyrmions that is
driven by SAW is still missing. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the motion
of N\'eel-type skyrmions in Ta/CoFeB/MgO/Ta multilayers driven by propagating
SAW pulses from on-chip piezoelectric transducers. Our results reveal that the
elastic wave with longitudinal and shear vertical displacements (Rayleigh wave)
traps skyrmions, while the shear horizontal wave effectively drives the motion
of skyrmions. In particular, a longitudinal motion along the SAW propagation
direction and a transverse motion due to topological charge, are observed and
further confirmed by our micromagnetic simulations. This work demonstrates a
promising approach based on acoustic waves for manipulating skyrmions, which
could offer new opportunities for ultra-low power spintronics.

<h3>Bound states and controllable currents on Topological Insulator surfaces  with extended magnetic defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04052" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04052</a>
<br>
<i>Eklavya Thareja, Ilya Vekhter</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that a magnetic line defect on the surface of a topological Insulator
generically supports two branches of spin-polarized and current carrying
one-dimensional bound states. We identify the components of magnetic scattering
that lead to the bound states. The velocity, and hence spin texture, of each of
those branches can be independently tuned by a magnetic field rotated in the
plane of the surface. We compute the local net and spin-resolved density of
states to identify experimental signatures of the bound states. The net spin
polarization and current due to both bound and scattering states varies
stepwise as a function of the electrostatic and magnetic components of the
scattering potential, and can be tuned by an applied field. We discuss
stability of the bound states with respect to impurity scattering.

<h3>Electromagnetic fluctuation and collective modes in relativistic bosonic  superfluid in mixed dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04053" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04053</a>
<br>
<i>Wei-Han Hsiao</i>
<br>
<br>
In Gaussian approximation, we investigate the marginal electromagnetic
fluctuation in models of charged relativistic bosonic superfluids in three and
two spatial dimensions at zero temperature. The electromagnetism is modeled by
the ordinary Maxwell term and the non-local pseudo-electrodynamics action in
these dimensions respectively. We explore the collective excitations in these
systems by integrating the superfluid velocity fields. In (3+1) dimensions, we
derive the roton mode reminiscent of what was discovered in the context of the
free relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate as a generalization of the Higgs
mode and determine the necessary and sufficient condition for the roton to
exist. In (2+1) dimensions, besides solving the dispersion relation for the
surface plasmon, we prove there cannot be roton-like excitation in this model
as opposed to its (3+1) dimensional counterpart, and additionally derive the
asymptotic lines of the dispersion in the limits of long wavelength and short
distance.

<h3>Electric control of spin states in frustrated triangular molecular  magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04066" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04066</a>
<br>
<i>J. F. Nossa, M. F. Islam, Mark R. Pederson, C. M. Canali</i>
<br>
<br>
Frustrated triangular molecular magnets are a very important class of
magnetic molecules since the absence of inversion symmetry allows an external
electric field to couple directly with the spin chirality that characterizes
their ground state. The spin-electric coupling in these molecular magnets leads
to an efficient and fast method of manipulating spin states, making them an
exciting candidate for quantum information processing. The efficiency of the
spin-electric coupling depends on the electric dipole coupling between the
chiral ground states of these molecules. In this paper, we report on
first-principles calculations of spin-electric coupling in $\{V_3\}$ triangular
magnetic molecule. We have explicitly calculated the spin-induced charge
redistribution within the magnetic centers that is responsible for the
spin-electric coupling. Furthermore, we have generalized the method of
calculating the strength of the spin-electric coupling to calculate any
triangular spin 1/2 molecule with $C_3$ symmetry and have applied it to
calculate the coupling strength in $\{V_{15}\}$ molecular magnets.

<h3>Phase Separation Induced by Curved Spacetime: Mobility Edge, Nonergodic  Critical Phase and Sub-Extended Phase</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04075" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04075</a>
<br>
<i>Shan-Zhong Li, Xue-Jia Yu, Shi-Liang Zhu, Zhi Li</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct a quasiperiodic lattice model in a curved spacetime to explore
the crossover concerning both condensed matter and curved spacetime physics. We
study the related Anderson localization and find that the model has a clear
boundary of localized-extended phase separation, which leads to the mobility
edge, i.e., the coexistence of nonergodic localized, critical and extended
phases. A novel self-consistent segmentation method is developed to calculate
the analytical expression of the critical position of phase separation, and the
rich phase diagram is determined by calculating the fractal dimension and
scaling index in multifractal analysis.

<h3>From topological phase to Anderson localization in a two-dimensional  quasiperiodic system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04082</a>
<br>
<i>Shujie Cheng, Reza Asgari, Gao Xianlong</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, the influence of the quasidisorder on a two-dimensional system
is studied. We find that there exists a topological phase transition
accompanied by a transverse Anderson localization. The topological properties
are characterized by the band gap, the edge-state spectra, the transport
conductance, and the Chern number. The localization transition is clearly
demonstrated by the investigations of the partial inverse participation ratio,
the average of level spacing ratio, and the fraction dimension. The results
reveal the topological nature of the bulk delocalized states. Our work
facilitates the understanding on the relationship between the topology and the
Anderson localization in two-dimensional disordered systems.

<h3>Ferromagnetic instability in itinerant fcc lattice electron systems with  higher order van Hove singularities: functional renormalization group study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04135" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04135</a>
<br>
<i>P. A. Igoshev, A. A. Katanin</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate a possibility of ferromagnetic ordering in the non-degenerate
Hubbard model on the face-centered cubic lattice within the functional
renormalization group technique using temperature as a scale parameter. We
assume the relations between nearest, next-nearest, and next-next-nearest
hopping parameters providing higher order (giant) van Hove singularity of the
density of states. The ferromagnetic instability formation with lowering
temperature is described consistently in the one-loop approximation for
one-particle irreducible vertex of two-particle electron interaction. The
chemical potential vs. temperature phase diagrams are calculated. We find
ferromagnetic order only for for sufficiently strong divergence of the density
of states and fillings in the vicinity of van Hove singularity. The obtained
Curie temperature is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the results
of the random-phase approximation. The main origin of the suppression of
ferromagnetism is the screening of interaction in the particle-particle
channel. We also do not find pronounced tendency to incommensurate order when
the Fermi level is moved away from van Hove singularity, such that the first
order quantum phase transitions from ferro- to paramagnetic phase are obtained.

<h3>Identification and characterization of various plastics using  THz-spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
THz spectroscopy has reached imaging capability with a spatial resolution of
a few micrometres. This property enables measurements and imaging of biological
samples like cells. THz photons have very low photon energies in the
millielectronvolt range. These energies interact mainly with vibrations in the
molecules. Therefore, the investigated samples are neither ionized nor their
DNA damaged, making this the perfect method for application on living cell
tissue. In the future, material databases with absorption spectra will empower
this method to distinguish even artificial particles like microplastics inside
biological tissue. Current research aims at the impact of plastic nanoparticles
on cell tissue considering various aspects. One of them is the investigation of
the potential harm, the interaction of these particles with human body cells

environment. THz absorption spectroscopy offers the opportunity to investigate
the polymers and identify them using their specific absorption lines as a
fingerprint. In this publication, we study different polymers and analyse their
particular fingerprints in the THz frequency spectrum from 0.1 up to 4 THz
using a commercially available THz spectrometer. With this work we are
contributing to the development, using THz waves for imaging, by identifying
the fingerprints of the four most used plastics by humankind. At the end of
this development, we envision a method to investigate the influence of
nanometre-sized plastic particles on the human body and other biological
organisms.

Structural changes in Ti1-xAlxN coated tool inserts used for turning in 316L
stainless steel were investigated by XANES, EXAFS, EDS, and STEM. For
coarse-grained fcc-structured Ti1-xAlxN coatings, with 0 \leq x \leq 0.62, the
XANES spectrum changes with Al-content. XANES Ti 1s line-scans across the rake
face of the worn samples reveals that TiN-enriched domains have formed during
turning in Ti0.47Al0.53N and Ti0.38Al0.62N samples as a result of spinodal
decomposition. The XANES spectra reveal the locations on the tool in which the
most TiN-rich domains have formed, indicating which part of the tool-chip
contact area that experienced the highest temperature during turning. Changes
in the pre-edge features in the XANES spectra reveal that structural changes
occur also in the w-TiAlN phase in fine-grained Ti0.38Al0.62N during turning.
EDS shows that Cr and Fe from the steel adhere to the tool rake face during
machining. Cr 1s and Fe 1s XANES show that Cr is oxidized in the end of the
contact length while the adhered Fe retains in the same fcc-structure as that
of the 316L stainless steel.

Many important ultrafast phenomena take place in the liquid phase. However,
there is no practical theory to predict how liquids respond to intense light.
Here, we propose an $ab~initio$ accurate method to study the non-perturbative
interaction of intense pulses with a liquid target to investigate its
high-harmonic emission. We consider the case of liquid water, but the method
can be applied to any other liquid or amorphous system. The liquid water
structure is reproduced using Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations in
a periodic supercell. Then, we employ real-time time-dependent density
functional theory to evaluate the light-liquid interaction. We outline the
practical numerical conditions to obtain a converged response. Also, we discuss
the impact of nuclei ultrafast dynamics on the non-linear response of system.
In addition, by considering two different ordered structures of ice, we show
how harmonic emission responds to the loss of long-range order in liquid water.

<br>
<br>
Electron spin transport at spin-splitting surface of
chiral-crystalline-structured metals and Edelstein effect at the interface are
studied, by using the Boltzmann transport equation beyond the relaxation time
approximation. We first provide a definition of spin relaxation time and spin
diffusion length for anisotropic spin--orbit coupling case, which are found
different for each spin component. We then construct a realistic model of the
interface between the chiral metal and other nonmagnetic metal with finite
thickness, prepared for spin absorption or injection. We provide analytical
expressions for efficiency of the charge current--spin current interconversion
as well as other coefficients found in the Edelstein effect. We finally develop
the Edelstein effect reciprocity along with experiments so that it relates
input and output quantities spatially separated by the interface. Our
formulation is valid also for the Rashba model and other spin-splitting
systems.

<br>
<br>
Coated conductors with magnetic substrates are thin multilayer structures;
their high aspect ratio and nonlinear material properties present significant
difficulties for numerical simulation. Using the high width-to-thickness ratio
of coated conductors we derive an integral formulation for a model based on an
infinitely thin approximation for the superconducting layer and a quasistatic
thin shell approximation for the magnetic substrate. The proposed model
describes electromagnetic response of a coated conductor with a magnetic
substrate and is much simpler than the existing models. A single dimensionless
parameter characterizes the substrate having a finite magnetic permeability and
a finite thickness. An accurate and efficient Chebyshev spectral method is
derived for numerical solution. The influence of a magnetic substrate on the
superconducting current and AC losses is investigated. In the limiting cases
our model solution tends to the known analytical solutions.

<br>
<br>
We propose that light-matter coupling can be used to realize a synthetic
dimension. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of
exciton-polariton sites to create a ladder model that exhibits a transition
from a Lieb lattice flat band to a finite mass dispersion by tuning
site-dependent light-matter coupling. Moreover, in a non-Hermitian system with
gain and loss, the flat band phase is much more robust and the transition is
accompanied by the appearance of exceptional points in the complex energy
spectrum. We demonstrate that by engineering the light-matter coupling in the
synthetic dimension, one can explore various phases in the polariton lasing
regime. Our proposal paves the way for studying non-Hermitian systems in higher
dimensions.

<br>
<br>
During the plastic deformation of crystalline materials, 3d dislocation
networks form based on dislocation junctions. Particularly, immobile Lomer
junctions are essential for the stability of dislocation networks. However, the
formed Lomer junctions can unzip and dissolve again, if the linked mobile
dislocations of the Lomer junction - the Lomer arms - experience sufficiently
high resolved shear stresses. To generate a better understanding of the
dislocation network stability and to pave the way to a general stability
criterion of dislocation networks, we investigate the Lomer arm length
distribution in dislocation networks by analyzing discrete dislocation dynamics
simulation data of tensile-tested aluminum single crystals. We show that an
exponential distribution fits best to the Lomer arm length distribution in the
systems considered, which is independent of the crystal orientation. The
influence of the slip system activity on the Lomer arm length distribution is
discussed.

<h3>Exciton ground state fine structure and excited states landscape in  layered halide perovskites from combined BSE simulations and symmetry  analysis</h3>

Layered halide perovskites are solution-processed natural heterostructures
where quantum and dielectric confinement effects down to the nanoscale strongly
influence the optical properties, leading to stabilization of bound excitons.
Achieving a detailed understanding of the exciton properties is crucial to
boost the exploitation of these materials in energy conversion and light
emission applications, with current on-going debate related to the energy order
of the four components of the most stable exciton. To provide theoretical
feedback and solve among contrasting literature reports, we perform here
ab-initio solution of the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE), with detailed
interpretation of the spectroscopic observables based on symmetry-analysis. We
confirm the Edark < Ein plane < Eout-of-plane fine-structure assignment, as
from recent magneto-absorption experiments. We further suggest that polar
distortions may lead to stabilization of the in-plane component and ultimately
end-up in a bright lowest exciton component. Also, we discuss the exciton
landscape over a broad energy range and clarify the exciton spin-character,
when large spin-orbit coupling is in play, to rationalize the potential of
halide perovskites as triplet sensitizers in combination with organic dyes. In
addition to contributing to the current understanding of the exciton properties
of layered halide perovskites, the work further evidence the in-depth knowledge
gained by combining advanced ab-initio simulations and group theory.

<h3>On the bridge hypothesis in the glass transition of freestanding polymer  films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Freestanding thin polymer films with high molecular weights exhibit an
anomalous decrease in the glass-transition temperature with film thickness.
Specifically, in such materials, the measured glass-transition temperature
evolves in an affine way with the film thickness, with a slope that weakly
depends on the molecular weight. De Gennes proposed a sliding mechanism as the
hypothetical dominant relaxation process in these systems, where stress kinks
could propagate in a reptation-like fashion through so called bridges, i.e.
from one free interface to the other along the backbones of polymer
macromolecules. Here, by considering the exact statistics of finite-sized
random walks within a confined box, we investigate in details the bridge
hypothesis. We show that the sliding mechanism cannot reproduce the basic
features appearing in the experiments, and we exhibit the fundamental reasons
behind such a fact.

We investigate the topological properties of the helical atomic chains
occurring in elemental selenium and tellurium. We postulate a realistic model
that includes spin-orbit interaction and show this to be topologically
non-trivial, with a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry.
We describe the end-states, which are orbitally polarized, with an orbital
density modulation strongly peaked at the edge. Furthermore, we propose a
simplified model that decomposes into three orbital chains, allowing us to
define a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry. We contrast
this result with recent observations made for the orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model containing a $p$-orbital zigzag chain.

Phase-space representations are a family of methods for dynamics of both
bosonic and fermionic systems, that work by mapping the system's density matrix
to a quasi-probability density and the Liouville-von Neumann equation of the
Hamiltonian to a corresponding density differential equation for the
probability. We investigate here the accuracy and the computational efficiency
of one approximate phase-space representation, called the fermionic Truncated
Wigner Approximation (fTWA), applied to the Fermi-Hubbard model. On a many-body
2D system, with hopping strength and Coulomb $U$ tuned to represent the
electronic structure of graphene, the method is found to be able to capture the
time evolution of first-order (site occupation) and second-order (correlation
functions) moments significantly better than the mean-field, Hartree-Fock
method. The fTWA was also compared to results from the exact diagonalization
method for smaller systems, and in general the agreement was found to be good.
The fully parallel computational requirement of fTWA scales in the same order
as the Hartree-Fock method, and the largest system considered here contained
198 lattice sites.

Under the Heisenberg evolution in chaotic quantum systems, initially simple
operators evolve into complicated ones and ultimately cover the whole operator
space. We study the growth of the operator ``size'' in this process, which is
related to the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We derive the full time
evolution of the size distribution in large $N$ quantum mechanics of Majorana
fermions. As examples, we apply the formalism to the Brownian SYK model
(infinite temperature) and the large $q$ SYK model (finite temperature).

Ferromagnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are of interest in
spintronics and superconducting spintronics. Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
can be achieved in thin ferromagnetic multilayer structures, when the
anisotropy is driven by carefully engineered interfaces. Devices with multiple
interfaces are disadvantageous for our application in superconducting
spintronics, where the current perpendicular to plane is affected by the
interfaces. Robust intrinsic PMA can be achieved in certain Co$_x$Pt$_{100-x}$
alloys and compounds at any thickness, without increasing the number of
interfaces. Here, we grow equiatomic Co$_{50}$Pt$_{50}$ and report a
comprehensive study on the structural, magnetic, and spin-polarisation
properties in the $L1_1$ and $L1_0$ ordered compounds. Primarily, interest in
Co$_{50}$Pt$_{50}$ has been in the $L1_0$ crystal structure, where layers of Pt
and Co are stacked alternately in the [100] direction. There has been less work
on $L1_1$ crystal structure, where the stacking is in the [111] direction. For
the latter $L1_1$ crystal structure, we find magnetic anisotropy perpendicular
to the film plane. For the former $L1_0$ crystal structure, the magnetic
anisotropy is perpendicular to the [100] plane, which is neither in-plane or
out-of-plane in our samples. We obtain a value for the ballistic spin
polarisation of the $L1_1$ and $L1_0$ Co$_{50}$Pt$_{50}$ to be $47\pm3\%$.

Photoconductivity of novel materials is the key property of interest for
design of photodetectors, optical modulators, and switches. Despite the
photoconductivity of most novel 2d materials has been studied both
theoretically and experimentally, the same is not true for 2d p-n junctions
that are necessary blocks of most electronic devices. Here, we study the
sub-terahertz photocoductivity of gapped bilayer graphene with
electrically-induced p-n junctions. We find a strong positive contribution from
junctions to resistance, temperature resistance coefficient and
photo-resistivity at cryogenic temperatures T ~ 20 K. The contribution to these
quantities from junctions exceeds strongly the bulk values at uniform channel
doping even at small band gaps ~ 10 meV. We further show that positive junction
photoresistance is a hallmark of interband tunneling, and not of intra-band
thermionic conduction. Our results point to the possibility of creating various
interband tunneling devices based on bilayer graphene, including
steep-switching transistors and selective sensors.

A density wave (DW) is a fundamental type of long-range order in quantum
matter tied to self-organization into a crystalline structure. The interplay of
DW order with superfluidity can lead to complex scenarios that pose a great
challenge to theoretical analysis. In the last decades, tunable quantum Fermi
gases have served as model systems for exploring the physics of strongly
interacting fermions, including most notably magnetic ordering, pairing and
superfluidity, and the crossover from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
superfluid to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we realize a Fermi gas
featuring both strong, tunable contact interactions and photon-mediated,
spatially structured long-range interactions in a transversely driven
high-finesse optical cavity. Above a critical long-range interaction strength
DW order is stabilized in the system, which we identify via its superradiant
light scattering properties. We quantitatively measure the variation of the
onset of DW order as the contact interaction is varied across the BCS-BEC
crossover, in qualitative agreement with a mean-field theory. The atomic DW
susceptibility varies over an order of magnitude upon tuning the strength and
the sign of the long-range interactions below the self-ordering threshold,
demonstrating independent and simultaneous control over the contact and
long-range interactions. Therefore, our experimental setup provides a fully
tunable and microscopically controllable platform for the experimental study of
the interplay of superfluidity and DW order.

In this work, using the methods of viscosimetry and thermal analysis, the
concentration changes in the values of the supercooling viscosity of Al-Mg
melts with Mg content from 2.5 to 95 at.% are studied. It is shown that the
temperature dependences of viscosity are well described by an exponential
dependence. The concentration dependence of viscosity is not monotonous and
reflects a change in the chemical short-range order in the liquid phase. The
concentration dependence of supercooling of Al-Mg melts is determined by the
type of solid phase formed during solidification, and also reflects the most
significant changes in the chemical short-range order in the liquid phase at 20
and 80 at.% Mg. Al-Mg alloys in the concentration ranges: 0-10, 40-50 and
90-100 at.% Mg are prone to non-equilibrium crystallization, the formation of
quasi-eutectics and solidification without intermediate intermetallic phases.

The shape-controlled synthesis of cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) photocatalysts with
both low or high index crystal planes has received increasing attention due to
their unique facet-dependent properties. Since they are cheap and earth
abundant, these well-defined Cu$_2$O nanostructures are extensively used for
different photocatalytic reactions, also because of their strong visible light
absorption capability. However, further development will be still needed to
enhance the efficiency and photostability of Cu$_2$O, which still limits its
industrial application. We start this review by summarizing the synthetic
advancement in the facet engineering of Cu$_2$O and other associated hybrid
Cu$_2$O-based heterostructures with a special emphasis put on their growth
mechanism. We then discuss different facet-dependent properties, which are
relevant to photocatalysis. In the subsequent section, we present a critical
discussion on the photocatalytic performance of faceted Cu$_2$O nanostructures
during organic synthesis, hydrogen production, and carbon dioxide
photoreduction. The relation between photocatalytic efficiency and product
selectivity with exposed crystal facets or with different composition of hybrid
nanostructures is also discussed. Finally, important strategies are proposed to
overcome the photostability issue, while outlining the course of future
development to further boost the technological readiness of well-defined
Cu$_2$O-based photocatalysts.

Current flow in electronic devices can be asymmetric with bias direction, a
phenomenon underlying the utility of diodes and known as non-reciprocal charge
transport. The promise of dissipationless electronics has recently stimulated
the quest for superconducting diodes, and non-reciprocal superconducting
devices have been realized in various non-centrosymmetric systems. Probing the
ultimate limits of miniaturization, we have created atomic-scale Pb--Pb
Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope. Pristine junctions
stabilized by a single Pb atom exhibit hysteretic behavior, confirming the high
quality of the junctions, but no asymmetry between the bias directions.
Non-reciprocal supercurrents emerge when inserting a single magnetic atom into
the junction, with the preferred direction depending on the atomic species.
Aided by theoretical modelling, we trace the non-reciprocity to quasiparticle
currents flowing via Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states inside the superconducting
energy gap. Our results open new avenues for creating atomic-scale Josephson
diodes and tuning their properties through single-atom manipulation.

A kagome lattice of 3d transition metals hosts flat bands, Dirac fermions and
saddle points. It provides a versatile platform for achieving topological
superconductivity, anomalous Hall effect, unconventional density wave order and
quantum spin liquid when the strong correlation, spin-orbit coupling or
magnetic order are involved in such a lattice. Here, using laser-based
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with density
functional theory calculations, we investigate the electronic structure of the
newly discovered kagome superconductor CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is isostructural
to the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs) kagome superconductors and possesses a
perfect two-dimensional kagome network of Titanium. We directly observed a
strikingly flat band derived from the local destructive interferences of Bloch
wave functions within the kagome lattices. We also identify the type-II Dirac
nodal loops around the Brillouin zone center, the type-III Dirac nodal loops
around the zone corners and type-III Dirac nodal lines along the k$_z$
direction. In addition, around the Brillouin zone center, Z2 nontrivial
topological surface states are also observed which is formed from the band
inversion due to strong spin orbital coupling. The simultaneous existence of
such multi-sets of nontrivial band structures in one kagome superconductor not
only provides good opportunities to study related physics in the kagome lattice
but also makes CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ an ideal system to realize noval quantum
phenomena by manipulating its chemical potential with chemical doping or

In Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, multiple intertwined orders are accompanied by
both electronic and structural instabilities. These exotic orders have

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission experiments and first-principles

reveal that the van Hove singularity (vHS) in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ can be tuned in a
large energy range without structural instability, different from that in
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. As such, CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ provides a complementary platform to

The optical injection of charge and spin currents are investigated in
Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ semiconductors as a function of Sn content. These emerging
silicon-compatible materials enable the modulation of these processes across
the entire mid-infrared range. Under the independent particle approximation,
the one- and two-photon interband absorption processes are elucidated, and the
evolution of the coherent control is discussed for three different polarization
configurations. To evaluate the contribution of high-energy transitions, a
full-zone 30-band k$\cdot$p is employed in the calculations. It was found that,
besides the anticipated narrowing of the direct gap and the associated shift of
the absorption to longer wavelengths, incorporating Sn in Ge also increases the
one-photon degree of spin polarization (DSP) at the $E_1$ resonance. Moreover,
as the Sn content increases, the magnitude of the response tensors near the
band edge exhibits an exponential enhancement. This behavior can be attributed
to the Sn incorporation-induced decrease in the carrier effective masses. This
trend appears to hold also at the $E_1$ resonance for pure spin current
injection, at least at low Sn compositions. The two-photon DSP at the band edge
exceeds the value in Ge to reach 60 % at a Sn content above 14 %. These results
demonstrate that Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ semiconductors can be exploited to achieve
the quantum coherent manipulation in the molecular fingerprint region relevant
to quantum sensing.

Central spin models provide an idealized description of interactions between
a central degree of freedom and a mesoscopic environment of surrounding spins.
We show that the family of models with a spin-1 at the center and XX
interactions of arbitrary strength with surrounding spins is integrable.
Specifically, we derive an extensive set of conserved quantities and obtain the
exact eigenstates using the Bethe ansatz. As in the homogenous limit, the
states divide into two exponentially large classes: bright states, in which the
spin-1 is entangled with its surroundings, and dark states, in which it is not.
On resonance, the bright states further break up into two classes depending on
their weight on states with central spin polarization zero. These classes are
probed in quench dynamics wherein they prevent the central spin from reaching
thermal equilibrium. In the single spin-flip sector we explicitly construct the
bright states and show that the central spin exhibits oscillatory dynamics as a
consequence of the semilocalization of these eigenstates. We relate the
integrability to the closely related class of integrable Richardson-Gaudin
models, and conjecture that the spin-$s_0$ central spin XX model is integrable
for any $s_0$.
