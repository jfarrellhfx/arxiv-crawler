<h3>Nonlinear Response in Diffusive Systems</h3>

Nonintegrable systems thermalize, leading to the emergence of fluctuating
hydrodynamics. Typically, this hydrodynamics is diffusive. We use the effective
field theory (EFT) of diffusion to compute higher-point functions of conserved
densities. We uncover a simple scaling behavior of correlators at late times,
and, focusing on three and four-point functions, derive the asymptotically
exact universal scaling functions that characterize nonlinear response in
diffusive systems. This allows for precision tests of thermalization beyond
linear response in quantum and classical many-body systems. We confirm our
predictions in a classical lattice gas.

<h3>Minimal Hubbard models of maximal Hilbert space fragmentation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02669</a>
<br>
<i>Yves H. Kwan, Patrick H. Wilhelm, Sounak Biswas, S.A. Parameswaran</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that Hubbard models with nearest-neighbor hopping and a
nearest-neighbor hardcore constraint exhibit `maximal' Hilbert space
fragmentation in many lattices of arbitrary dimension $d$. Focusing on the
$d=1$ rhombus chain and the $d=2$ Lieb lattice, we demonstrate that the
fragmentation is strong for all fillings in the thermodynamic limit, and
explicitly construct all emergent integrals of motion, which include an
extensive set of higher-form symmetries. Blockades consisting of frozen
particles partition the system in real space, leading to anomalous dynamics.
Our results are potentially relevant to optical lattices of dipolar and
Rydberg-dressed atoms.

<h3>Noise Induced Universal Diffusive Transport in Fermionic Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02671</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher M. Langlett, Shenglong Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a microscopic transport theory in a randomly driven fermionic
model where the operator dynamics arise from the competition between noisy and
static couplings. We map the noise-averaged operator equation of motion to a
one-dimensional non-hermitian hopping model and solve it exactly. We uncover
that universal diffusive behavior is attributed to an emergent noise induced
bound state in the operator equations of motion at small momentum. As momentum
increases, in the strong noise limit, the diffusive mode persists to $k=2\pi$
as the operator equation becomes the diffusion equation and is unaffected by
additional arbitrarily strong static terms that commute with the local charge,
including density-density interactions. On the other hand, at finite noise, the
bound state enters a continuum of scattering states and vanishes. However, the
bound state reemerges at an exceptional-like point in the spectrum after the
bound-to-scattering state phase transition. We further characterize the fate of
Stark localization in the presence of noise, where we ultimately show that
noise washes away any signature of localization, and diffusion ensues.

<h3>The "ABC'' of adatomic collapse in correlated Moir√©less multi-graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02680" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02680</a>
<br>
<i>W.C. Silva, A.M. Freitas, L.T. Lustosa, J.E. Sanches, M. de Souza, A. C. Seridonio</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose that a multi-graphene of ABC-type stacking yields virtual bound
states lying within the Coulomb insulating gap of an Anderson-like adatom.
Wondrously, a virtual state constitutes the counterpart of the atomic collapse
phenomenon proposed in relativistic atomic Physics, while the second emerges as
its particle-hole symmetric, analogous to a positron state. Thus, we introduce
the effect as the adatomic collapse, which occurs due to a flat band with a
dispersionless state and a divergent density of states
$\sim|\varepsilon-\varepsilon_{F}|^{2/J-1}$ near the Fermi energy
$\varepsilon_{F}$ for $J\geq3,$ where $J\pi$ is the Berry phase. We conclude
this scenario based on the Kramers-Kronig transformation of the quasiparticle
broadening, from where we observe that the aforementioned van Hove singularity
induces virtual bound states. Counterintuitively, near the singularity, we find
these states above and below the Fermi energy correlated to the existence of
the bottom and top edges of the Coulomb insulating region, respectively. As
such a behavior rises without a twist, the system is known as Moir\'eless and
the phenomenon emerges also assisted by the adatom Coulomb correlations. Thus,
we point out that multi-graphene is a proper playground for emulating
well-established relativistic phenomena.

<h3>Control of 4-magnon-scattering in a magnonic waveguide by pure spin  current</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02708" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02708</a>
<br>
<i>Toni Hache, Lukas Koerber, Tobias Hula, Kilian Lenz, Attila Kakay, Olav Hellwig, Juergen Lindner, Juergen Fassbender, Helmut Schultheiss</i>
<br>
<br>
We use a pure spin current originating from the spin Hall effect to generate
a spin-orbit torque (SOT) strongly reducing the effective damping in an
adjacent ferromagnet. Due to additional microwave excitation, large spin-wave
amplitudes are achieved exceeding the threshold for 4-magnon scattering, thus
resulting in additional spin-wave signals at discrete frequencies. Two or more
modes are generated below and above the directly pumped mode with equal
frequency spacing. It is shown how this nonlinear process can be controlled in
magnonic waveguides by the applied dc current and the microwave pumping power.
The sudden onset of the nonlinear effect after exceeding the thresholds can be
interpreted as spiking phenomenom which makes the effect potentially
interesting for neuromorphic computing applications. Moreover, we investigated
this effect under microwave frequency and external field variation. The
appearance of the additional modes was investigated in the time-domain
revealing a time delay between the directly excited and the simultaneously
generated nonlinear modes. Furthermore, spatially resolved measurements show
different spatial decay lengths of the directly pumped mode and nonlinear
modes.

<h3>A Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials</h3>

<br>
An in-depth insight into the chemistry and nature of the individual chemical
bonds is essential for understanding materials. Bonding analysis is thus
expected to provide important features for large-scale data analysis and
machine learning of material properties. Such chemical bonding information can
be computed using the LOBSTER software package, which post-processes modern
density functional theory data by projecting the plane wave-based wave
functions onto a local, atomic orbital basis. With the help of a fully
automatic workflow, the VASP and LOBSTER software packages are used to generate
the data. We then perform bonding analyses on 1520 compounds (insulators and
semiconductors) and provide the results as a database. The database structure
of the bonding analysis database, which allows easy data retrieval, is also
explained. The projected densities of states and bonding indicators are
benchmarked on standard density-functional theory computations and available
heuristics, respectively. Lastly, we illustrate the predictive power of bonding
descriptors by constructing a machine-learning model for phononic properties,
which shows an increase in prediction accuracies by 27 % (mean absolute errors)
compared to a benchmark model differing only by not relying on any
quantum-chemical bonding features.

<h3>Optomechanical coupling and damping of a carbon nanotube quantum dot</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02748" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02748</a>

Carbon nanotubes are excellent nano-electromechanical systems, combining high
resonance frequency, low mass, and large zero-point motion. At cryogenic
temperatures they display high mechanical quality factors. Equally they are
outstanding single electron devices with well-known quantum levels and have
been proposed for the integration of charge or spin qubits. The integration of
these devices into microwave optomechanical circuits is however hindered by a
mismatch of scales, between typical microwave wavelengths, nanotube segment
lengths, and nanotube deflections. As experimentally demonstrated recently in
[Blien et al., Nat. Comm. 11, 1363 (2020)], coupling enhancement via the
quantum capacitance allows to circumvent this restriction. Here we extend the
discussion of this experiment. We present the subsystems of the device and
their interactions in detail. An alternative approach to the optomechanical
coupling is presented, allowing to estimate the mechanical zero point motion
scale. Further, the mechanical damping is discussed, hinting at hitherto
unknown interaction mechanisms.

<h3>Temporal evolution of electric transport properties of YBCO Josephson  junctions produced by focused Helium ion beam irradiation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02749" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02749</a>
<br>
<i>M. Karrer, K. Wurster, J. Linek, M. Meichsner, R. Kleiner, E. Goldobin, D. Koelle</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a $30\,\mathrm{keV}$ focused He ion beam (He-FIB) with a wide range of
irradiation doses $D=100$ to $1000\,\mathrm{ions/nm}$ we fabricated Josephson
and resistive barriers within microbridges of epitaxially grown single
crystalline YBCO thin films and investigated the change of their electric
transport properties with time. One set of samples (#1A) was simply stored at
room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. A second set (#2D) was
post-annealed at $90^\circ\,\mathrm{C}$ using high oxygen pressures and a third
set (#2E) at low oxygen pressures. We found that for #1A the critical current
density $j_c$ at $4.2\,\mathrm{K}$ changes as $j_c\propto\exp(-\sqrt{t/\tau})$
with time $t$, where the relaxation times $\tau$ increases exponentially with
$D$, which can be described within a limited diffusion based model. In order to
increase the diffusion rate we annealed the junctions from #2D at
$90^\circ\,\mathrm{C}$ for $30\,\mathrm{min}$ in oxygen environment. Directly
after annealing the critical current density $j_c$ increased, while the normal
state resistance $R_n$ decreased. Repeated measurements showed that within a
week the junctions relaxed to a quasi-stable state, in which the time scale for
junction parameter variations increased to several weeks, making this a
feasible option to achieve temporal stability of parameters of He-FIB Josephson
junctions in YBCO.

<h3>Intrinsic Origin and Enhancement of Topological Responses in  Ferrimagnetic Antiperovskite Mn4N</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02750</a>
<br>
<i>Temuujin Bayaraa, Vsevolod Ivanov, Liang Z. Tan, Sin√©ad M. Griffin</i>
<br>
<br>
Using first-principles calculations we investigate the intrinsic origins of
the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in
antiperovskite ferrimagnet Mn4N. We predict that the AHE is significantly
enhanced under both compressive and tensile strain, however, the ANE generally
decreases under epitaxial strain, except for 1% compressive strain. We connect
this behavior to the evolution of the Berry curvature with strain, suggesting
similar strategies for achieving large AHE and ANE changes with modest amounts
of strain. Finally, we find that the non-monotonic characteristics of the AHE
and ANE stem from the formation and movement of new Weyl points at the
periphery of the Brillouin Zone under compressive and tensile strains.

<h3>Observation of charge-to-spin conversion with giant efficiency at  Ni$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$/Bi$_{2}$WO$_{6}$ interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02751" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02751</a>

<br>
<br>
Magnetization switching using spin-orbit torque offers a promising route to
developing non-volatile memory technologies. The prerequisite, however, is the
charge-to-spin current conversion, which has been achieved traditionally by
harnessing the spin-orbit interaction in heavy metals, topological insulators,
and heterointerfaces hosting a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas.
Here, we report the observation of charge-to-spin current conversion at the
interface between ferromagnetic Ni$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$ and ferroelectric
Bi$_{2}$WO$_{6}$ thin films. The resulting spin-orbit torque consists of
damping-like and field-like components, and the estimated efficiency amounts to
about 0.48 $\pm$ 0.02, which translates to 0.96 $\pm$ 0.04 nm$^{-1}$ in terms
of interfacial efficiency. These numbers are comparable to contemporary
spintronic materials exhibiting giant spin-orbit torque efficiency. We suggest
that the Rashba Edelstein effect underpins the charge-to-spin current
conversion on the interface side of Ni$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$. Further, we provide
an intuitive explanation for the giant efficiency in terms of the spin-orbit
proximity effect, which is enabled by orbital hybridization between W and Ni
(Fe) atoms across the interface. Our work highlights that Aurivillius compounds
are a potential addition to the emerging transition metal oxide-based
spin-orbit materials.

<h3>Curvature-mediated Programming of Liquid Crystal Microflows</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02759" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02759</a>
<br>
<i>Kamil Fedorowicz, Robert Prosser, Anupam Sengupta</i>
<br>
<br>
Using experiments and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the
curvature of microscale conduits allow programming of liquid crystal (LC)
flows. Focusing on a nematic LC flowing through U- and L-shaped channels of
rectangular cross-section, our results reveal that curved flow paths can
trigger gradients of flow-induced director field in the transverse direction.
The emergent director field feeds back into the flow field, ultimately leading
to LC flows controlled by the channel curvature. This curvature-mediated flow
control, identified by polarizing optical microscopy and supported by the
nematofluidic solutions, offers novel concepts in LC-based microfluidic valves
and throttles, wherein the throughput distribution is determined by the
Ericksen number and the variations in the local curvature. Finally, this work
highlights the role of deformation history on flow-induced director alignments,
when the viscous and elastic effects comparable in strength.

<h3>Squeezing oscillations in a multimode bosonic Josephson junction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum simulators built from ultracold atoms promise to study quantum
phenomena in interacting many-body systems. However, it remains a challenge to
experimentally prepare strongly correlated continuous systems such that the
properties are dominated by quantum fluctuations. Here, we show how to enhance
the quantum correlations in a multimode bosonic Josephson junction; our
approach is based on the ability to track the dynamics of quantum properties.
After creating a bosonic Josephson junction at the stable fixed point of the
classical phase space, we observe squeezing oscillations in the two conjugate
variables. We show that the squeezing oscillation frequency can be tuned by
more than one order of magnitude and we are able to achieve a spin squeezing
close to 10 dB by utilizing this oscillatory dynamics. The impact of improved
spin squeezing is directly revealed by detecting enhanced spatial phase
correlations between decoupled condensates. Our work provides new ways for
engineering correlations and entanglement in the external degree-of-freedom of
interacting many-body systems.

<h3>A method for extracting effective interactions from Hi-C data with  applications to interphase chromosomes and inverted nuclei</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02795" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02795</a>
<br>
<i>Sucheol Shin, Guang Shi, D. Thirumalai</i>
<br>
<br>
Contact probabilities between loci, separated by arbitrary genomic distance,
for a number of cell types have been reported using genome-wide chromosome
conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments. How to directly use the experimental
data, without an underlying model, to extract the effective interaction
energies between active euchromatin (A) and inactive heterochromatin (B) is an
open problem. Here we first calculate the pairwise effective interaction
energies (A-A, B-B, or A-B) for interphase chromosomes based on Hi-C data by
using the concept of Statistical Potential (SP). The assumption in the SP
evaluation is that the interaction energy between two loci is proportional to
the logarithm of the frequency with which they interact. Polymer simulations,
using the extracted interaction energy values without any parameter, naturally
results in the segregation between A and B type loci (compartments), and the
emergence of topologically associating domains (TADs), features that are
prominent in the Hi-C data for interphase chromosomes. Remarkably, the values
of the SP automatically satisfy the Flory-Huggins phase separation criterion
for all the chromosomes, which explains the compartment formation in interphase
chromosomes. Strikingly, simulations using the SP that accounts for
pericentromeric constitutive heterochromatin (C), show hierarchical structuring
with the high density of C in the nuclear center, followed by localization of
the B type loci, with euchromatin being confined to the nuclear periphery,
which is in accord with the imaging data for photoreceptor rods in nocturnal
mammals. The proposed parameter free method and applications show that
compartment formation in conventional and inverted nuclei is best explained by
the inequality between the effective interaction energies, with heterochromatin
attraction being the dominant driving force.

Recent experimental synthesis of ambient-stable MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayer via
chemical vapor deposition and the experimental demonstration of exceptional
mechanical and electrical properties have garnered enormous research interests.
The intercalation morphology of MA$_2$Z$_4$ have motivated the computational
discovery of an expansive family of synthetic MA$_2$Z$_4$monolayers with no
bulk materials counterparts. MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers exhibit highly unusual
electronic, magnetic, optical, excitonic, valleytronic, piezoelectronic and
topological properties, making them a compelling material platform for
realizing next-generation device technologies. Recent advancement in
heterostructure engineering further expands the opportunities of MA$_2$Z$_4$
beyond their monolayer form, while also introduces enormous challenges due to
the huge design space for combining two or more monolayers to form a
heterostructure. In this review, we summarize the recent rapid progress on the
computational design of MA$_2$Z$_4$-based heterostructures based on
first-principle density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Various types of
heterostructures have been computationally discovered via DFT simulations
recently, covering a large variety of applications, such as transistor channel,
electrical contacts, spintronic devices, photodetectors, solar cells,
photocatalytic water splitters and so on. We systematically classify the
MA$_2$Z$_4$-based heterostructures based on their contact types, and review
their physical properties, with particular focuses on highlighting their
performances in electronics, optoelectronics and energy conversion
applications. This review unveils the vast device application potentials of
MA$_2$Z$_4$-based heterostructures, and shall motivate the future experimental
and theoretical efforts on the design and development of MA$_2$Z$_4$-based
functional heterostructure devices.

<h3>Heat statistics in the relaxation process of the Edwards-Wilkinson  elastic manifold</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02843</a>

<i>Yu-Xin Wu, Jin-Fu Chen, Ji-Hui Pei, Fan Zhang, H. T. Quan</i>
<br>
<br>
The stochastic thermodynamics of systems with a few degrees of freedom has
been studied extensively so far. We would like to extend the study to systems
with more degrees of freedom and even further-continuous fields with infinite
degrees of freedom. The simplest case for a continuous stochastic field is the
Edwards-Wilkinson elastic manifold. It is an exactly solvable model of which
the heat statistics in the relaxation process can be calculated analytically.
The cumulants require a cutoff spacing to avoid ultra-violet divergence. The
scaling behavior of the heat cumulants with time and the system size as well as
the large deviation rate function of the heat statistics in the large size
limit is obtained.

<h3>Experimental verification of band convergence in Sr and Na codoped PbTe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02844</a>

<br>
<br>
Scanning tunneling microscopy and transport measurements have been performed
to investigate the electronic structure and its temperature dependence in
heavily Sr and Na codoped PbTe, which is recognized as one of the most
promising thermoelectric materials. Our main findings are as follows: (i) Below
T=4.5 K, all carriers are distributed in the first valence band at the L point
(L band), which forms tube-shaped Fermi surfaces with concave curvature. With
Sr and Na doping, the dispersion of the L band changes, and the band gap
increases from 200 meV to 300 meV. (ii) At T=4.5 K, the Fermi energy is located
~100 meV below the edge of the L band for the Sr/Na codoped PbTe. The second
valence band at the Sigma point (Sigma band) is lower than the L band by 150
meV, which is significantly smaller than that of pristine PbTe (200 meV). The
decrease in the band offset, leading to band convergence, provides a desirable
condition for thermoelectric materials.(iii) With increasing temperature, the
carrier distribution to the Sigma band starts at T=100 K and we estimate that
about 50 percent of the total carriers are redistributed in the Sigma band at
T=300 K.Our work demonstrates that scanning tunneling microscopy and angular
dependent magnetoresistance measurements are particularly powerful tools to
determine the electronic structure and carrier distribution. We believe that
they will provide a bird's eye view of the doping strategy towards realizing
high-efficiency thermoelectric materials.

<h3>Topological spin Hall effect in antiferromagnets driven by vector N√©el  chirality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02850</a>
<br>
<i>Kazuki Nakazawa, Koujiro Hoshi, Jotaro J. Nakane, Jun-ichiro Ohe, Hiroshi Kohno</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin Hall effect of spin-texture origin is explored theoretically for
antiferromagnetic (AF) metals. It is found that a vector chirality formed by
the N\'eel vector gives rise to a topological spin Hall effect. This is
topological since it is proportional to the winding number counted by in-plane
vector chirality along the sample edge, which can be nonvanishing for AF merons
but not for AF skyrmions. The effect is enhanced when the Fermi level lies near
the AF gap, and, surprisingly, at weak coupling with small AF gap. These
features are confirmed numerically based on the Landauer-B\"uttiker formula.
Important roles played by nonadiabatic processes and spin dephasing are pointed
out.

<h3>Band engineered bilayer Haldane model: Evidence of multiple topological  phase transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02880</a>
<br>
<i>Sayan Mondal, Saurabh Basu</i>
<br>
<br>
We have studied the evolution of the topological properties of a
band-engineered AB-stacked bilayer honeycomb structure in the presence of a
Haldane flux. Without a Haldane flux, band engineering makes the band touching
points (the so-called Dirac points) move towards each other and eventually
merge into one at an intermediate $\mathbf{M}$ point in the Brillouin zone.
Here the dispersion is linear along one direction and quadratic along the
other. In the presence of a Haldane flux, the system acquires topological
properties, and finite Chern numbers can be associated with the pairs of the
conduction and the valence bands. The valence band closer to the Fermi level
($E_F$) possesses Chern numbers equal to $\pm2$ and $\pm1$, while the one
further away from $E_F$ corresponds to Chern numbers $\pm1$. The conduction
bands are associated with similar properties, except their signs are reversed.
The Chern lobes shrink in the band-engineered model, and we find evidence of
multiple topological phase transitions, where the Chern numbers discontinuously
jump from $\pm2$ to $\mp2$, $\pm1$ to $\mp1$, $\pm1$ to $0$ to $\pm2$ and
$\pm2$ to $\pm1$. These transitions are supported by the presence or absence of
the chiral edge modes in a nanoribbon bilayer geometry and the vanishing of the
plateau in the anomalous Hall conductivity. Different phases are further
computed for different hopping amplitudes across the layers, which shows the
shrinking of the Chern lobes for large interlayer tunneling.

High-entropy alloys are extensively studied due to their very promising
properties. However manufacturing methods currently used to prepare HEAs are
complicated, costly, and likely non-industrially scalable processes. This
limits their evolution and poses questions regarding the material's
applicability in the future. Considering the abovementioned point, we developed
a novel methodology for efficient HEA production using a low ball-to-powder
ratio (BPR). Using different milling times, we manufactured four HEA powder
precursors using a BPR of 5:1, which were later sintered via the Spark Plasma
Sintering technique and heat treated. Microstructural characterization was
performed by optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with EDS
and EBSD detectors, and X-ray diffraction. Mechanical properties were measured
using nano and microhardness techniques. In this work, we follow the structural
evolution of the material and connect it with the strengthening effect as a
function of milling time. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of different
sintering and annealing conditions, proving that HEAs characterized by high
mechanical properties may be manufactured using low BPR.

Analog switching in ferroelectric devices promises neuromorphic computing
with highest energy efficiency, if limited device scalability can be overcome.
To contribute to a solution, we report on the ferroelectric switching
characteristics of sub-5 nm thin Al$_{0.74}$Sc$_{0.26}$N films grown on
Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si and epitaxial Pt/GaN/sapphire templates by sputter-deposition. In
this context, we focus on the following major achievements compared to
previously available wurtzite-type ferroelectrics: 1) Record low switching
voltages down to 1 V are achieved, which is in a range that can be supplied by
standard on-chip voltage sources. 2) Compared to the previously investigated
deposition of thinnest Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N films on epitaxial templates, a
significantly larger coercive field to breakdown field ratio is observed for
Al$_{0.74}$Sc$_{0.26}$N films grown on silicon substrates, the technologically
most relevant substrate-type. 3) The formation of true ferroelectric domains in
wurtzite-type materials is for the first time demonstrated on the atomic scale
by scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations of a sub-5 nm thin
partially switched film. The direct observation of inversion domain boundaries
within single nm-sized grains supports the theory of a gradual domain-wall
motion limited switching process in wurtzite-type ferroelectrics. Ultimately,
this should enable the analog switching necessary for mimicking neuromorphic
concepts also in highly scaled devices.

<br>
<br>
Finite size armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNR) of different families are
theoretically studied using the Hubbard model in both mean-field and GW
approximations, including spin correlation effects. It is shown that
correlation primarily affect the properties of topological end states of the
nanoribbons. A representative structure of each of the three GNR families is
considered but the 7-atom width nanoribbon is studied in detail and compared to
experimental results, showing a clear improvement when correlations are
included. Using on numerically computed local density of states, spin-polarized
measurements in scanning tunneling microscopy are also suggested to help
distinguish and highlight correlation effects.

<br>
<br>
The magnetic exchange coupling between magnetic impurities and a
superconductor induce so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states which undergo a
quantum phase transition (QPT) upon increasing the exchange interaction beyond
a critical value. While the evolution through the QPT is readily observable, in
particular if the YSR state features an electron-hole asymmetry, the
concomitant change in the ground state is more difficult to identify. We use
ultralow temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate how the
change in the YSR ground state across the QPT can be directly observed for a
spin-1/2 impurity in a magnetic field. We observe a change in the excitation
spectrum from the doublet ground state in the free spin regime (two spectral
features) to the singlet ground state in the screened spin regime (four
spectral features). We also identify a transition regime, where the YSR
excitation energy is smaller than the Zeeman energy. We thus provide a
straightforward way for unambiguously identifying the ground state of a
spin-1/2 YSR state.

<br>
<br>
Diffusion involving atom transport from one location to another governs many
important processes and behaviors such as precipitation and phase nucleation.
Local chemical complexity in compositionally complex alloys poses challenges
for modeling atomic diffusion and the resulting formation of chemically ordered
structures. Here, we introduce a neural network kinetics (NNK) scheme that
predicts and simulates diffusion-induced chemical and structural evolution in
complex concentrated chemical environments. The framework is grounded on
efficient on-lattice structure and chemistry representation combined with
neural networks, enabling precise prediction of all path-dependent migration
barriers and individual atom jumps. Using this method, we study the
temperature-dependent local chemical ordering in a refractory Nb-Mo-Ta alloy
and reveal a critical temperature at which the B2 order reaches a maximum. Our
atomic jump randomness map exhibits the highest diffusion heterogeneity
(multiplicity) in the vicinity of this characteristic temperature, which is
closely related to chemical ordering and B2 structure formation. The scalable
NNK framework provides a promising new avenue to exploring diffusion-related
properties in the vast compositional space within which extraordinary
properties are hidden.

<h3>Random Lindblad operators obeying detailed balance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02960</a>
<br>
<i>Wojciech Tarnowski, Dariusz Chru≈õci≈Ñski, Sergey Denisov, Karol ≈ªyczkowski</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce different ensembles of random Lindblad operators $\cal L$, which
satisfy quantum detailed balance condition with respect to the given stationary
state $\sigma$ of size $N$, and investigate their spectral properties. Such
operators are known as `Davies generators' and their eigenvalues are real;
however, their spectral densities depend on $\sigma$. We propose different
structured ensembles of random matrices, which allow us to tackle the problem
analytically in the extreme cases of Davies generators corresponding to random
$\sigma$ with a non-degenerate spectrum for the maximally mixed stationary
state, $\sigma = \mathbf{1} /N$. Interestingly, in the latter case the density
can be reasonably well approximated by integrating out the imaginary component
of the spectral density characteristic to the ensemble of random unconstrained
Lindblad operators. The case of asymptotic states with partially degenerated
spectra is also addressed. Finally, we demonstrate that similar universal
properties hold for the detailed balance-obeying Kolmogorov generators obtained
by applying superdecoherence to an ensemble of random Davies generators. In
this way we construct an ensemble of random classical generators with imposed
detailed balance condition.

<h3>Imaging Temperature and Thickness of Thin Planar Liquid Water Jets in  Vacuum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02967" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02967</a>
<br>
<i>Tillmann Buttersack, Henrik Haak, Hendrik Bluhm, Uwe Hergenhahn, Gerard Meijer, Bernd Winter</i>
<br>
<br>
We present spatially resolved measurements of the temperature of a flat
liquid water microjet for varying pressures, from vacuum to 100% relative
humidity. The entire jet surface is probed in a single shot by a
high-resolution infrared camera. Obtained 2D images are substantially
influenced by the temperature of the apparatus on the opposite side of the IR
camera; a protocol to correct for the thermal background radiation is
presented. In vacuum, we observe cooling rates due to water evaporation on the
order of 105 K/s. For our system, this corresponds to a temperature decrease of
approximately 15 K between upstream and downstream positions of the flowing
leaf. Making reasonable assumptions on the absorption of the thermal background
radiation in the flatjet we can extend our analysis to infer a thickness map.
For a reference system our value for the thickness is in good agreement with
the one reported from white light interferometry.

<h3>Defect-induced band restructuring and length scales in twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03018</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas Baldo, Tomas L√∂thman, Patric Holmvall, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effects of single, multiple, and extended defects in the
form of non-magnetic impurities and vacancies in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG)
at and away from the magic angle, using a fully atomistic model and focusing on
the behavior of the flat low-energy moir\'e bands. For strong impurities and
vacancies in the $AA$ region we find a complete removal of one of the four
moir\'e bands, resulting in a significant depletion of the charge density in
the $AA$ regions even at extremely low defect concentrations. We find similar
results for other defect locations, with the exception of the least coordinated
sites in the $AB$ region, where defects instead result in a peculiar band
replacement process within the moir\'e bands. In the vacancy limit, this
process yields a band structure misleadingly similar to the pristine case.
Moreover, we show that triple point fermions, which are the crossing of the
Dirac point by a flat band, appearing for single, periodic, defects, are
generally not preserved when adding extended or multiple defects, and thus
likely not experimentally relevant. We further identify two universal length
scales for defects, consisting of charge modulations on the atomic scale and on
the moir\'e scale, illustrating the importance of both the atomic and moir\'e
structures for understanding TBG. We show that our conclusions hold beyond the
magic angle and for fully isolated defects. In summary, our results demonstrate
that the normal state of TBG and its moir\'e flat bands are extremely sensitive
to both the location and strength of non-magnetic impurities and vacancies,
which should have significant implications for any emergent ordered state.

<h3>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of $V_{N}-V_{Ga}$ complex in $BGaN$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Metastable photoinduced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) signal at low
temperatures is reported in GaN alloyed with boron ($B_{x}Ga_{1-x}N$) epitaxial
layers grown at temperatures ranging from 840 {\deg}C to 1090 {\deg}C. An
isotropic EPR line with g = 2.004 is observed with intensity depending on the
growth temperature for all samples with boron content between 0.73% and 2.51%.
Temperature dependence of EPR intensities is compared with the results of
High-Resolution Photoinduced Transient Spectroscopy (HRPITS). This allows to
link particular traps with EPR signal. The activation energies of these traps
are consistent with the theoretical position of the $V_{N}-V_{Ga}$ complex.
Thermal annihilation of the EPR signal with 30 meV activation energy
corresponds to shallow donor ionization. The model explaining light-induced EPR
signal involving redistribution of electrons between deep and shallow donors
mediated by photoionization to the conduction band is proposed.

<h3>Hall anomaly and vortex charge in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_x$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a systematic study of the Hall conductance in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_x$ (Bi2212) thin films over a large range of doping. We
find that in a large part of the phase diagram the Hall coefficient changes
sign as a function of temperature in the flux-flow regime. By comparing data
from many samples, we show that the sign reversal is tied to the
superconducting transition and is not a result of a competing order. We then
compare our data to the predictions of the Bardeen-Stephan model and show that
in all samples there is an additional negative contribution to the Hall
conductivity. We extract from the negative excess Hall a vortex-charge that is
found to be strongly doping dependent.

<h3>The most probable distributions with finite number of particles and the  applications on Bose-Einstein condensation</h3>

<i>Qi-Wei Liang, Wenyu Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the Asynchronous Finite Differences Method utilized for the
calculation of the most probable distributions of finite particle number
systems, this study employs numerical variation and central difference
techniques to provide more precise estimations regarding these distributions.
Specifically, three novel finite distributions are derived and applied to
Bose-Einstein condensation, revealing that the critical condition
($n\lambda^3=2.612$) may be relaxed in finite particle number scenarios.
Moreover, maintaining density as a constant is anticipated to result in a
higher critical temperature compared to infinite number systems. Notably, the
obtained condensate number on the zero-energy level surpasses that of
predictions generated by canonical distributions.

<br>
<br>
The Shell-ferromagnetic effect originates from the segregation process in
off-stochiometric Ni-Mn-based Heusler. In this work, we investigate the
precipitation process of L2$_1$-ordered Ni$_2$MnSn and L1$_0$-ordered NiMn in
off-stochiometric Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{45}$Sn$_{5}$ during temper annealing, by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and $^{119}$Sn M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. While XRD probes
long-range ordering of the lattice structure, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy probes
nearest-neighbour interactions, reflected in the induced Sn magnetic moment. As
shown in this work, the induced magnetic Sn moment can be used as a detector
for microscopic structural changes and is, therefore, a powerful tool for
investigating the formation of nano-precipitates. Similar research can be
performed in the future, for example, on different pinning type magnets like
Sm-Co or Nd-Fe-B.

For the Mott insulator state of the Fermi-Hubbard model in the
strong-coupling limit, we study the interaction between quasi-particles in the
form of doublons and holons. Comparing different methods -- the hierarchy of
correlations, strong-coupling perturbation theory, and exact analytic solutions
for the Hubbard tetramer -- we find an effective interaction between doublons
and/or holons to linear order in the hopping strength $T$ which can display
attractive as well as repulsive contributions, depending on the involved
momenta. Finally, we speculate about the implications of our findings for
high-temperature superconductivity.

<br>
<br>
We present all-electrical operation of a Fe$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$-based Curie switch
at room temperature. More specifically, we study the current-induced
thermally-driven transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) indirect coupling in a
Fe/Cr/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$/Cr/Fe multilayer. Magnetometry measurements at
different temperatures show that the transition from the ferromagnetic to the
antiferromagnetic coupling at zero field is observed at $\sim$325K. Analytical
modelling confirms that the observed temperature-dependent transition from
indirect ferromagnetic to indirect antiferromangetic interlayer exchange
coupling originates from the modification of the effective interlayer exchange
constant through the ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the
Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ spacer with minor contributions from the
thermally-driven variations of the magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of the
Fe layers. Room-temperature current-in-plane magnetotransport measurements on
the patterned Fe/Cr/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$/Cr/Fe strips show the transition
from the 'low-resistance' parallel to the 'high-resistance' antiparallel
remanent magnetization configuration, upon increased probing current density.
Quantitative comparison of the switching fields, obtained by magnetometry and
magnetotransport, confirms that the Joule heating is the main mechanism
responsible for the observed current-induced resistive switching.

<h3>Molecular simulations of sliding on SDS surfactant films</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the frictional response of the
anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) monolayers and hemicylindrical
aggregates physisorbed on gold. Our simulations of a sliding spherical asperity
reveals two friction regimes: At low loads, the films show Amontons' friction
with a friction force that rises linearly with normal load. At high loads, the
friction force is independent of load as long as no direct solid-solid contact
occurs. The transition between these two regimes happens when only a single
molecular layer is confined in the gap between the sliding bodies. The friction
force at high loads on a monolayer rises monotonically with film density and
drops slightly with the transition to hemicylindrical aggregates. This
monotonous increase of friction force is compatible with a traditional plowing
model of sliding friction. At low loads, the friction coefficient reaches a
minimum at intermediate surface concentrations. We attribute this behavior to a
competition between adhesive forces, repulsion of the compressed film, and the
onset of plowing.

Intrinsic topological superconducting materials are exotic and vital to
develop the next-generation topological superconducting devices, topological
quantum calculations, and quantum information technologies. Here, we predict
the topological and nodal superconductivity of MS (M = Nb and Ta)
transition-metal sulfides by using the density functional theory for
superconductors combining with the symmetry indicators. We reveal their
higher-order topology nature with an index of Z4 = 2. These materials have a
higher Tc than the Nb or Ta metal superconductors due to their flat-band and
strong electron-phonon coupling nature. Electron doping and lighter isotopes
can effectively enhance the Tc. Our findings show that the MS (M = Nb and Ta)
systems can be new platforms to study exotic physics in the higher-order
topological superconductors, and provide a theoretical support to utilize them
as the topological superconducting devices in the field of advanced topological
quantum calculations and information technologies.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic cooling has the potential to replace conventional gas compression
refrigeration. Materials such as La(Fe,Si)$_{13}$ exhibit a sizeable
first-order magnetocaloric effect, and it is possible to tailor the phase
transition towards room temperature by Mn-H-doping, resulting in a large
temperature range for operation. Within this work, we discuss variations of the
electronic and lattice structure in La(Fe,Si)$_{13}$ with increasing Mn content
utilizing X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and extended X-ray
absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). While XMCD shows a decrease of
the magnetic polarization at the Fe K edge, low-temperature EXAFS measurements
indicate increased positional disorder in the La environment that is otherwise
absent for Fe and Mn. First-principles calculations link the positional
disorder to an enlarged Mn-Si distance -- explaining the increased positional
disorder in the La surrounding.

<br>
<br>
Low-dimensional materials have remarkable properties that are distinct from
their bulk counterparts. A paradigmatic example is Ising superconductivity that
occurs in monolayer materials such as NbSe2 which show a strong violation of
the Pauli limit. In monolayers, this occurs due to a combination of broken
inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling that locks the spins of the
electrons out-of-plane. Bulk NbSe2 is centrosymmetric and is therefore not an
Ising superconductor. We show that bulk misfit compound superconductors,
(LaSe)1.14(NbSe2) and (LaSe)1.14(NbSe2)2, comprised of monolayers and bilayers
of NbSe2, exhibit unexpected Ising protection with a Pauli-limit violation
comparable to monolayer NbSe2, despite formally having inversion symmetry. We
study these misfit compounds using complementary experimental methods in
combination with first-principles calculations. We propose theoretical
mechanisms of how the Ising protection can survive in bulk materials. We show
how some of these mechanisms operate in these bulk compounds due to a concerted
effect of charge-transfer, defects, reduction of interlayer hopping, and
stacking. This highlights how Ising superconductivity can, unexpectedly, arise
in bulk materials, and possibly enable the design of bulk superconductors that
are resilient to magnetic fields.

<br>
Zirconium alloys are widely used as the fuel cladding material in pressurised
water reactors, accumulating a significant population of defects and
dislocations from exposure to neutrons. We present and interpret synchrotron
microbeam X-ray diffraction measurements of proton-irradiated Zircaloy-4, where
we identify a transient peak and the subsequent saturation of dislocation
density as a function of exposure. This is explained by direct atomistic
simulations showing that the observed variation of dislocation density as a
function of dose is a natural result of the evolution of the dense defect and
dislocation microstructure driven by the concurrent generation of defects and
their subsequent stress-driven relaxation. In the dynamic equilibrium state of
the material developing in the high dose limit, the defect content distribution
of the population of dislocation loops, coexisting with the dislocation
network, follows a power law with exponent $\alpha \approx 2.2$. This
corresponds to the power law exponent of $\beta \approx 3.4$ for the
distribution of loops as a function of their diameter that compares favourably
with the experimentally measured values of $\beta$ in the range $ 3 \leq \beta
\leq 4$.

A material described as lutetium-hydrogen-nitrogen (Lu-H-N in short) was
recently claimed to have near-ambient superconductivity[Gammon et al, Nature
615, 244, 2023]. If the results could be reproduced by other teams, it would be
a major scientific breakthrough. Here, we report our results of transport and
structure measurements on a material prepared using the same method as that
reported by Gammon et al. Our X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that the
obtained sample contained three substances: the FCC-1 phase (Fm-3m) with a
lattice parameter a=5.03 {\AA}, the FCC-2 phase (Fm-3m) with a lattice
parameter a= 4.755 {\AA} and Lu metal. These two FCC phases are identical to
the those reported in the so-called near-ambient superconductor. However, we
found that the samples had no evidence of superconductivity, through our
resistance measurements in the temperature range of 300 - 4 K and pressure
range of 0.9 - 3.4 GPa, and our magnetic susceptibility measurements in the
pressure range of 0.8-3.3 GPa and temperature down to 100 K. We also used a
laser heating technique to heat the sample to 1800{\deg}C and found no
superconductivity in the produced dark blue samples below 6.5 GPa. In addition,
the color of the both samples remain dark blue in the pressure range
investigated.

This is a review of the theory of quantum thermodynamic demons; these are
quantum systems that look like they violate the laws of thermodynamics, in
analogy with Maxwell's demon. It concentrates on autonomous demons that can be
made using nanoelectronics. Here ``autonomous'' means that the demon operates
without any external measurement or driving, making it possible to model their
entire thermodynamic behaviour using Schr\"odinger's equation. My main aim is
to review why cracks in the laws of thermodynamics, sometimes glimpsed in such
systems, have turned out to be illusory.
For this, I work by example, introducing the methods of quantum
thermodynamics via an old thought experiment that appears to break the second
law. This thought experiment is usually known as Smoluchowski's trapdoor,
although it was first proposed by Maxwell. Smoluchowski showed that the
trapdoor's thermal motion complicates its dynamics, but I argue that he did not
show that it must obey the second law. This question is now of practical
relevance, because a nanoelectronic version of the trapdoor can be made with
quantum dots. The methods presented here show that such a quantum trapdoor
obeys the laws of thermodynamics.
This reviews then addresses other types of autonomous demon that
superficially appear to break the laws of thermodynamics, but which do not.
These include an experimental demonstration of a Maxwell demon, and a kind of
demon that exploit non-equilibrium resources (the N-demon). It discusses a way
of classifying different kinds of autonomous demon. It concludes by briefly
reviewing how fluctuations affect nanoelectronics, and how their role in
stochastic thermodynamics changes our view of entropy.

The phase change compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST225) is exploited in
advanced non-volatile electronic memories and in neuromorphic devices which
both rely on a fast and reversible transition between the crystalline and
amorphous phases induced by Joule heating. The crystallization kinetics of
GST225 is a key functional feature for the operation of these devices. We
report here on the development of a machine-learned interatomic potential for
GST225 that allowed us to perform large scale molecular dynamics simulations
(over 10000 atoms for over 100 ns) to uncover the details of the
crystallization kinetics in a wide range of temperatures of interest for the
programming of the devices. The potential is obtained by fitting with a deep
neural network (NN) scheme a large quantum-mechanical database generated within
Density Functional Theory. The availability of a highly efficient and yet
highly accurate NN potential opens the possibility to simulate phase change
materials at the length and time scales of the real devices.

Topological magnetic defects in multiferroic materials acquire an electric
charge or dipole moment due to the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism.
This magnetoelectric coupling makes possible to excite large-amplitude
collective motion of topological magnetic textures with an oscillating electric
field. Here, I discuss electric excitation of a polar optical mode in a
vortex-antivortex crystal and the electrically-induced spin precession in a
magnetic skyrmion, which gives rise to rotation of skyrmions around each other
and a translational motion of skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs. The electric
manipulation of magnetic topological defects in Mott insulators can find
applications in magnetoelectric memory and logical devices.

In this work, we report on the growth of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
crystals from an iron flux at atmospheric pressure and high temperature and
demonstrate that (i) the entire sheet of hBN crystals can be detached from the
metal in a single step using hydrochloric acid and that (ii) these hBN crystals
allow the fabrication of high carrier mobility graphene devices. By combining
spatially-resolved confocal Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport
measurements, we confirm the excellent quality of these crystals for
high-performance hBN-graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures. The full
width at half maximum of the graphene Raman 2D peak is as low as 16 cm$^{-1}$,
and the room temperature charge carrier mobilitiy is around 80000 cm$^2$/(Vs)
at a carrier density 1$\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-12}$. This is fully comparable
with devices of similar dimensions fabricated using crystalline hBN synthesized
by the high pressure and high temperature method. Finally, we show that for
high quality hBN crystals the hBN Raman peak line width, in contrast to the
graphene 2D line width, does not contain any useful information for
benchmarking the hBN substrate or encapsulant.

We address dynamics of open many-body systems governed by the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. We attempt to solve this
equation in the Heisenberg representation, i.e. for observables, not states. We
demonstrate that there are broad classes of models where the GKSL equation can
be solved (essentially) exactly for certain observables. In the simplest case,
the only effect of dissipation is an exponential decay on top of a coherent
dynamics. This is true, in particular, for the total energy, provided the
Hamiltonian is an eigenoperator of the dissipation superoperator - no matter
whether the model is integrable or not. In more complex cases, dissipation
alters the dynamics in a much more profound way. As an example, we solve the
GKSL equation for a set of observables in a dissipative one-dimensional $XX$
model. It turns out that the observables experience the Wannier-Stark
localization in the Krylov space of operators. As a result, the expectation
values of the observables are linear combinations of a discrete set of decay
modes.

<h3>Microscopic characterization of the magnetic properties of the itinerant  antiferromagnet La2Ni7 by 139La NMR/NQR measurements</h3>

<br>
<br>
139La nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR)
measurements have been performed to investigate the magnetic properties of the
itinerant magnet La2Ni7 which shows a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase
transitions at $T_{N1}$=61 K, $T_{N2}$=56 K, and $T_{N3}$=42 K under zero
magnetic field. Two distinct La NMR signals were observed due to the two
crystallographically inequivalent La sites in La2Ni7 (La1 and La2 in the La2Ni4
and the LaNi5 sub-units of the La2Ni7 unit cell, respectively). From the 139La
NQR spectrum in the AFM state below $T_{N3}$, the AFM state was revealed to be
a commensurate state where Ni ordered moments align along the crystalline c
axis. Owing to the two different La sites, we were able to estimate the average
values of the Ni ordered moments ($\sim$0.07-0.08 $\mu_{B}$/Ni and
$\sim$0.17$\mu_{B}$/Ni around La1 and La2, respectively) from 139La NMR
spectrum measurements in the AFM state below $T_{N3}$, suggesting a non-uniform
distribution of the Ni-ordered moments in the AFM state. In contrast, a more
uniform distribution of the Ni-ordered moments in the saturated paramagnetic
state induced by the application of high magnetic fields is observed. The
temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization measured by the internal
field at the La2 site in the AFM state was reproduced by a local moment model
better than the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory for weak itinerant
antiferromagnets. Given the small Ni-ordered moments in the magnetically
ordered state, our results suggest that La2Ni7 has characteristics of both
itinerant and localized natures in its magnetism. With this in mind, it is
noteworthy that the temperature dependence of nuclear spin-relaxation rates in
the paramagnetic state above $T_{N1}$ measured at zero magnetic field can be
explained qualitatively by both the SCR theory and the local-moment model.

<h3>Anomalous Floquet Topological Disclination States</h3>

Recently, non-reciprocal two-dimensional unitary scattering networks have
gained considerable interest due to the possibility of obtaining robust edge
wave propagation in the anomalous Floquet phase. Conversely, zero-dimensional
topological states in such networks have been left uncharted. Here, we
demonstrate the existence of Floquet disclination states in non-reciprocal
scattering networks. The disclination states, characterized by spectral
charges, nucleate in the anomalous phase from a resonant rotation-symmetric
phase matching condition, and survive until the bandgaps close. Once coupled to
the radiation continuum feeding the anomalous chiral edge state, they can
induce intriguing topological disclination bound states in the continuum
(BICs), associated with an extreme confinement and lifetime. Altogether,
anomalous Floquet disclination states and topological disclination BIC broaden
the applications of disclination states to microwave, acoustic or optical
scattering networks, with new possibilities in chiral topological lasing,
robust energy squeezing from topological bound states, and switchable lasing
and anti-lasing behavior induced via unidirectional topological coupling.

Nucleation in systems with a metastable liquid-gas critical point is the
prototypical example of a two-step nucleation process, in which the appearance
of the critical nucleus is preceded by the formation of a liquid-like density
fluctuation. So far, the majority of studies on colloidal and protein
crystallization have focused on one-component systems, and we are lacking a
clear description of two-step nucleation processes in multicomponent systems,
where critical fluctuations involve coupled density and concentrations
inhomogeneities. Here, we examine the nucleation process of a binary mixture of
patchy particles designed to nucleate into a diamond lattice. By combining
Gibbs-ensemble simulations and direct nucleation simulations over a wide range
of thermodynamic conditions, we are able to pin down the role of the liquid-gas
metastable phase diagram on the nucleation process. In particular, we show that
the strongest enhancement of crystallization occurs at an azeotropic point with
the same stoichiometric composition of the crystal.

<h3>Exploring the Spin Dynamics of a Room-Temperature Diamond Maser using an  Extended rate Equation Model</h3>

Masers - the microwave analogue of lasers - are coherent microwave sources
that can act as oscillators or quantum-limited amplifiers. Masers have
historically required high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures to operate, but
recently masers based on diamond have been demonstrated to operate at room
temperature and pressure, opening a route to new applications as ultra-low
noise microwave amplifiers. For these new applications to become feasible at a
mass scale, it is important to optimise diamond masers by minimising their size
and maximising their gain, as well as the maximum input power of signals that
can be amplified. Here, we develop and numerically solve an extended rate
equation model to present a detailed phenomenology of masing dynamics and
determine the optimal properties required for the cavity, resonator and gain
medium in order to develop portable maser devices. We conclude by suggesting
how the material parameters of the diamond gain media and dielectric resonators
used in diamond masers can be optimised and how rate equation models could be
further developed to incorporate the effects of temperature and nitrogen
concentration on spin lifetimes.

<h3>Constrains on s and d components of electron boson coupling constants in  one band d wave Eliashberg theory for high Tc superconductors</h3>

The phenomenology of overdoped high Tc superconductors can be described by a
one band d wave Eliashberg theory where the mechanism of superconducting
coupling is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and whose
characteristic energy Omega0 scales with Tc according to the empirical law
Omega0 = 5.8 kBTc. This model presents universal characteristics that are
independent of the critical temperature such as the link between the s and d
components of electron boson coupling constants and the invariance of the ratio
2Delta/kBTc.

Probabilistic cellular automata describe the dynamics of classical spin
models, which, for sufficiently small temperature $T$, can serve as classical
memory capable of storing information even in the presence of nonzero external
magnetic field $h$. In this article, we study a recently-introduced
probabilistic cellular automaton, the sweep rule, and map out a region of two
coexisting stable phases in the $(T,h)$ plane. We also find that the sweep rule
belongs to the weak two-dimensional Ising universality class. Our work is a
step towards understanding how simple geometrically-local error-correction
strategies can protect information encoded into complex noisy systems, such as
topological quantum error-correcting codes.

<h3>Exceptional hyper-surfaces of transfer matrices of finite-range lattice  models and their consequences on quantum transport properties</h3>

We investigate the emergence and corresponding nature of exceptional points
located on exceptional hyper-surfaces of non-hermitian transfer matrices for
finite-range one-dimensional lattice models. We unravel the non-trivial role of
these exceptional points in determining the system size scaling of electrical
conductance in non-equilibrium steady state. We observe that the band edges of
the system always correspond to the transfer matrix exceptional points.
Interestingly, albeit the lower band edge always occurs at wave-vector $k=0$,
the upper band edge may or may not correspond to $k=\pi$. Nonetheless, in all
the cases, the system exhibits universal subdiffusive transport for conductance
at every band edge with scaling $N^{-b}$ with scaling exponent $b= 2$. However,
for cases when the upper band edge is not located at $k=\pi$, the conductance
features interesting oscillations with overall $N^{-2}$ scaling. Our work
further reveals that this setup is uniquely suited to systematically generate
higher order transfer matrix exceptional points at upper band edge when one
considers finite range hoppings beyond nearest neighbour. Additional
exceptional points other than those at band edges are shown to occur, although
interestingly, these do not give rise to anomalous transport.

Particles hopping on a two-dimensional hyperbolic lattice feature
unconventional energy spectra and wave functions that provide a largely
uncharted platform for topological phases of matter beyond the Euclidean
paradigm. Using real-space topological markers as well as Chern numbers defined
in the higher-dimensional momentum space of hyperbolic band theory, we
construct and investigate hyperbolic Haldane models, which are generalizations
of Haldane's honeycomb-lattice model to various hyperbolic lattices. We present
a general framework to characterize point-group symmetries in hyperbolic
tight-binding models, and use this framework to constrain the multiple first
and second Chern numbers in momentum space. We observe several topological gaps
characterized by first Chern numbers of value $1$ and $2$. The momentum-space
Chern numbers respect the predicted symmetry constraints and agree with
real-space topological markers, indicating a direct connection to observables
such as the number of chiral edge modes. With our large repertoire of models,
we further demonstrate that the topology of hyperbolic Haldane models is
trivialized for lattices with strong negative curvature.

<h3>Scaling and localization in kinetically constrained diffusion</h3>

We study diffusion in systems of classical particles whose dynamics conserves
the total center of mass. This conservation law leads to several interesting
consequences. In finite systems, it mandates that all equilibrium distributions
be exponentially localized near system boundaries. It also yields an unusual
approach to equilibrium, which in $d$ dimensions exhibits scaling with
dynamical exponent $z = 4+d$. Similar phenomena occur for dynamics that
conserves higher moments of the density, which we systematically classify using
a family of nonlinear diffusion equations. In the quantum setting, analogous
fermionic systems are shown to form real-space Fermi surfaces, while bosonic
versions display a real-space analog of Bose-Einstein condensation.

<h3>Semantic Information in a model of Resource Gathering Agents</h3>

We explore the application of a new theory of Semantic Information to the
well-motivated problem of a resource foraging agent. Semantic information is
defined as the subset of correlations, measured via the transfer entropy,
between agent $A$ and environment $E$ that is necessary for the agent to
maintain its viability $V$. Viability, in turn, is endogenously defined as
opposed to the use of exogenous quantities like utility functions. In our
model, the forager's movements are determined by its ability to measure, via a
sensor, the presence of an individual unit of resource, while the viability
function is its expected lifetime. Through counterfactual interventions --
scrambling the correlations between agent and environment via noising the
sensor -- we demonstrate the presence of a critical value of the noise
parameter, $\eta_c$, above which the forager's expected lifetime is
dramatically reduced. On the other hand, for $\eta < \eta_c$ there is
little-to-no effect on its ability to survive. We refer to this boundary as the
semantic threshold, quantifying the subset of agent-environment correlations
that the agent actually needs to maintain its desired state of staying alive.
Each bit of information affects the agent's ability to persist both above and
below the semantic threshold. Modeling the viability curve and its semantic
threshold via forager/environment parameters, we show how the correlations are
instantiated. Our work provides a useful model for studies of established
agents in terms of semantic information. It also shows that such semantic
thresholds may prove useful for understanding the role information plays in
allowing systems to become autonomous agents.
