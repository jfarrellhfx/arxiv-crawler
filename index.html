<p>Decades ago, Gurzhi proposed that if momentum-conserving collisions prevail
among heat-carrying phonons in insulators and charge-carrying electrons in
metals, hydrodynamic features will become detectable. In this paper, we will
review the experimental evidence emerging in the last few years supporting this
viewpoint and raising new questions. The focus of the paper will be bulk
crystals without (or with a very dilute concentration) of mobile electrons and
steady-state thermal transport. We will also discuss the possible link between

<h3>Influence of microstructure on mass loss caused by acoustic and  hydrodynamic cavitation</h3>

<p>The proposed study investigates the damage mechanisms of martensitic
stainless steel X3CrNiMo13-4 exposed to cavitation using two complementary
experimental apparatus: ultrasonic horn (MUCEF) and hydrodynamic tunnel
(PREVERO). Cavitation testing has been carried out on two different
metallurgical states: QT780 and QT900 corresponding to coarse and fine
microstructure respectively. Acoustic cavitation erosion tests have been
performed on the MUCEF equipment inspired from the ASTM G32 standards but
specially designed to be installed inside X-Ray tomographs. The ultrasonic horn
operates at 20 kHz and the tested specimen is located at 500 $\mu$m from the
horn tip. Hydrodynamic cavitation erosion tests were conducted with classic
experimental conditions of PREVERO device: a cavitation number of 0.87
corresponding to a flow velocity of 90 m.s-1 and an upstream pressure of 40
bars. For acoustic cavitation, mass loss has been identified as dependent of
the microstructure while for hydrodynamic cavitation the mass loss is identical
whatever the microstructure size.

<h3>Roles of Energy and Entropy in Multiscale Dynamics and Thermodynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14831" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14831</a>
<br>
<i>Miroslav Grmela</i>
<p>Multiscale thermodynamics is a theory of relations among levels of
description. Energy and entropy are its two main ingredients. Their roles in
the time evolution describing approach of a level (starting level) to another
level involving less details (target level) is examined on several examples,
including the level on which macroscopic systems are seen as composed of
microscopic particles, mesoscopic levels as kinetic theory of ideal and van der
Waals gases, fluid mechanics, the level of chemical kinetics, and the level of
equilibrium thermodynamics. The entropy enters the emergence of the target
level in two roles. It expresses internal energy, that is the part of the
energy that cannot be expressed in terms of the state variables used on the
starting level, and it reveals emerging features characterizing the target
level by sweeping away unimportant details. In the case when the target level
is a mesoscopic level involving time evolution the roles of the energy and the
entropy is taken by two different potentials that are related to their rates.

<h3>The Stability of Gapped Quantum Matter and Error-Correction with  Adiabatic Noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14906</a>
<br>
<i>Ali Lavasani, Sagar Vijay</i>
<p>The codespace of a quantum error-correcting code can often be identified with
the degenerate ground-space within a gapped phase of quantum matter. We argue
that the stability of such a phase is directly related to a set of coherent
error processes against which this quantum error-correcting code (QECC) is
robust: such a quantum code can recover from adiabatic noise channels,
corresponding to random adiabatic drift of code states through the phase, with
asymptotically perfect fidelity in the thermodynamic limit, as long as this
adiabatic evolution keeps states sufficiently "close" to the initial
ground-space. We further argue that when specific decoders -- such as
minimum-weight perfect matching -- are applied to recover this information, an
error-correcting threshold is generically encountered within the gapped phase.
In cases where the adiabatic evolution is known, we explicitly show examples in
which quantum information can be recovered by using stabilizer measurements and
Pauli feedback, even up to a phase boundary, though the resulting decoding
transitions are in different universality classes from the optimal decoding
transitions in the presence of incoherent Pauli noise. This provides examples
where non-local, coherent noise effectively decoheres in the presence of
syndrome measurements in a stabilizer QECC.

<h3>Exploring limits of dipolar quantum simulators with ultracold molecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14914</a>
<br>
<i>Yuliya Bilinskaya, Michael Hughes, Paolo Molignini</i>
<p>We provide a quantitative blueprint for realizing two-dimensional quantum
simulators employing ultracold dipolar molecules or magnetic atoms by studying
their accuracy in predicting ground state properties of lattice models with
long-range interactions. For experimentally relevant ranges of potential
depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations,
we map out the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator
and the target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically
exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multi-band
lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. While the
agreement between quantum simulator and single-band models is good for deep
optical lattices with weaker interactions and low particle densities, the
higher band population rapidly increases for shallow lattices, stronger
interactions, and in particular above half filling. This induces drastic
changes to the properties of the simulated ground state, potentially leading to
false predictions. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between
commensurability and interactions can lead to quasidegeneracies, rendering a
faithful ground state preparation even more challenging.

<h3>Entanglement Microscopy: Tomography and Entanglement Measures via  Quantum Monte Carlo</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14916" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14916</a>
<br>
<i>Ting-Tung Wang, Menghan Song, Liuke Lyu, William Witczak-Krempa, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<p>We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full
reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo
simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows
to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement
measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by
studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial
dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa
transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits
short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and
temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN
consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond
bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large
parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also
analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN
for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum
state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging
with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens
a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be
explored.

<h3>Anti-screening and nonequilibrium layer electric phases in graphene  multilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14918</a>
<br>
<i>Ying Xiong, Mark S. Rudner, Justin C.W. Song</i>
<p>Screening is a ubiquitous phenomenon through which the polarization of bound
or mobile charges tends to reduce the strengths of electric fields inside
materials. Here we show how photoexcitation can be used as a knob to transform
conventional out-of-plane screening into anti-screening - the amplification of
electric fields - in multilayer graphene stacks. We find that, by varying the
photoexcitation intensity, multiple nonequilibrium screening regimes can be
accessed, including near-zero screening, anti-screening, or overscreening
(reversing electric fields). Strikingly, at modest continuous wave
photoexcitation intensities, the nonequilibrium polarization states become
multistable, hosting light-induced ferroelectric-like steady states with
nonvanishing out-of-plane polarization (and band gaps) even in the absence of
an externally applied displacement field in nominally inversion symmetric
stacks. This rich phenomenology reveals a novel paradigm of dynamical quantum
matter that we expect will enable a variety of nonequilibrium broken symmetry
phases.

<h3>Kuramoto model subject to subsystem resetting: How resetting a part of  the system may synchronize the whole of it</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14921" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14921</a>
<br>
<i>Rupak Majumder, Rohitashwa Chattopadhyay, Shamik Gupta</i>
<p>We introduce and investigate the effects of a new class of stochastic
resetting protocol called subsystem resetting, whereby a subset of the system
constituents in a many-body interacting system undergoes bare evolution
interspersed with simultaneous resets at random times, while the remaining
constituents evolve solely under the bare dynamics. We pursue our investigation
within the ambit of the well-known Kuramoto model of coupled phase-only
oscillators of distributed natural frequencies. Here, the reset protocol
corresponds to a chosen set of oscillators being reset to a synchronized state
at random times. We find that the mean $\omega_0$ of the natural frequencies
plays a defining role in determining the long-time state of the system. For
$\omega_0=0$, the system reaches a synchronized stationary state at long times,
characterized by a time-independent non-zero value of the synchronization order
parameter. Moreover, we find that resetting even an infinitesimal fraction of
the total number of oscillators has the drastic effect of synchronizing the
entire system, even when the bare evolution does not support synchrony. By
contrast, for $\omega_0 \ne 0$, the dynamics allows at long times either a
synchronized stationary state or an oscillatory synchronized state, with the
latter characterized by an oscillatory behavior as a function of time of the
order parameter, with a non-zero time-independent time average. Our results
thus imply that the non-reset subsystem always gets synchronized at long times
through the act of resetting of the reset subsystem. Our results, analytical
using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz as well as those based on numerical simulations,
are obtained for two representative oscillator frequency distributions, namely,
a Lorentzian and a Gaussian. We discuss how subsystem resetting may be employed
as an efficient mechanism to control attainment of global synchrony.

<h3>Impact of Nanometer-Thin Stiff Layer on Adhesion to Rough Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15014" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15014</a>
<br>
<i>Shubhendu Kumar, Babu Gaire, Bo Persson, Ali Dhinojwala</i>
<p>Adhesion requires molecular contact, and natural adhesives employ mechanical
gradients to achieve complete (conformal) contact to maximize adhesion.
Intuitively, one expects that the higher the modulus of the top layer, the
lower will be the adhesion strength. However, the relationship between the
thickness of the stiff top layer and adhesion is not known. In this work, we
quantified the adhesion between a stiff glassy poly (methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) layer of varying thickness on top of a soft poly dimethyl siloxane
(PDMS) elastomer with a sapphire lens. We found that only about 90 nm thick
PMMA layer on a relatively thicker, softer, and elastic PDMS block is required
to drop macroscopic adhesion to almost zero during the loading cycle. This drop
in adhesion for bilayers can be explained using a conformal model developed by
Persson and Tosatti, where the elastic energy to create conformal contact
depends on both the thickness and the mechanical properties of the bilayer. A
better understanding of the influence of mechanical gradients on adhesion will
have an impact on adhesives, friction, and colloidal and granular physics.

<h3>Radiative recombination rate suppressed in a quantum photocell with  three electron donors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15024" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15024</a>
<br>
<i>Jing-Yi Chen, Shun-Cai Zhao</i>
<p>The radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs represents a great
challenge to the photon-to-charge efficiency in photocell. In this paper, we
visit the radiative recombination rate (RRR) in a quantum photocell with or
without three dipole-dipole coupled electron donors. The results show that
different gaps play the same roles while the ambient temperatures play
different roles in the suppressed RRR with or without three dipole-dipole
coupled electron donors. What's more, the dipole-dipole coupling strength J can
greatly inhibit the RRRs with three dipole-dipole coupled electron donors,
which indicates the quantum coherence generated by three coupled donors is an
efficient approach to suppress RRR, and it is different from the quantum
coherence mentioned by Marlan O. Scully [PRL 104, 207701 (2010)]. This
presented scheme may propose some regulating strategies for efficient
conversion efficiency via the suppressed RRR.

<h3>Enhanced quantum yields and efficiency in a quantum dot photocell  modeled by a multi-level system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15026</a>
<br>
<i>Shun-Cai Zhao, Jing-Yi Chen</i>
<p>To absorb the photons below the band-gap energy effectively, we proposed a
quantum dot (QD) photocell modeled by multi-level system for the quantum yields
and photo-to-charge efficiency limits. The theoretical results show the quantum
yields are enhanced as compared to the single band-gap solar cell, and the
photo-to-charge efficiencies are larger than Shockley and Queisser efficiency
in the same absorbed spectrum. What's more, at the room temperature the
efficiency limits are well beyond 63% achieved by Luque and Marti
(Ref\cite{26}) due to absorbing the low-energy photons via two sub-bands in
this proposed photocell system. The achievements may reveal a novel theoretical
approach to enhance the QD photocell performance modeled a multi-level
absorbing photons system.

<h3>Elastic interactions compete with persistent cell motility to drive  durotaxis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15036" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15036</a>
<br>
<i>Subhaya Bose, Haiqin Wang, Xinpeng Xu, Arvind Gopinath, Kinjal Dasbiswas</i>
<p>Many animal cells crawling on elastic substrates exhibit durotaxis and have
implications in several biological processes including tissue development, and
tumor progression. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model for durotactic
migration incorporating both elastic deformation-mediated cell-substrate
interactions and the stochasticity of cell migration. Our model is motivated by
the key observation in one of the first demonstrations of durotaxis: a single
contractile cell at an interface between a softer and a stiffer region of an
elastic substrate reorients and migrates towards the stiffer region. We model
migrating cells as self-propelling, persistently motile agents that exert
contractile, dipolar traction forces on the underlying elastic substrate. The
resulting substrate deformations induce elastic interactions with mechanical
boundaries, captured by an elastic potential that depends on cell position and
orientation relative to the boundary. The potential is attractive or repulsive
depending on whether the mechanical boundary condition is clamped or free,
which represents the cell being on the softer or stiffer side, respectively, of
a confining boundary. The forces and torques from the interactions drive cells
to orient perpendicular (parallel) to the boundary and accumulate (deplete) at
the clamped (free) boundary, extent of which is determined by elastic potential
(A) and motility (Pe). While the elastic interaction drives durotaxis, cell
migratory movements such as random reorientation and self-propulsion enable the
cell from the attractive potential thereby reducing durotaxis. We define
metrics quantifying boundary accumulation and durotaxis and present a phase
diagram that identifies three possible regimes: durotaxis, adurotaxis without
accumulation and adurotaxis with motility-induced accumulation at a confining
boundary.

<h3>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</a>
<br>
<i>Jiang Zhang, Ruyi Tao, Bing Yuan</i>
<p>The theory of causal emergence based on effective information suggests that
complex systems may exhibit a phenomenon called causal emergence, where the
macro-dynamics demonstrate a stronger causal effect than the micro-dynamics.
However, a challenge in this theory is the dependence on the method used to
coarse-grain the system. In this letter, we propose a novel notion of dynamical
reversibility and build a coarse-graining method independent theory of causal
emergence based on that. We not only found an approximately asymptotic
logarithmic relation between dynamical reversibility and effective information
for measuring causal effect, but also propose a new definition and
quantification of causal emergence that captures the intrinsic properties of
the Markov dynamics. Additionally, we also introduce a simpler method for
coarse-graining large Markov chains based on the dynamical reversibility.

<h3>Effects of Misorientation on Single Crystal Plasticity by Finite Element  Methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15056" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15056</a>
<br>
<i>John D. Shimanek, Zi-Kui Liu, Allison M. Beese</i>
<p>The crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) is a widely used
technique for resolving macroscopic stress and strain onto the physically
relevant length scales of grains and slip systems in ductile crystalline
materials like structural metals. Here, the calibration of a CPFEM model for
single crystal applications was found to depend critically on loading
orientation, with an effect significant even at an angle of 0.1 degrees. Slight
misorientation from high symmetry loading affected lattice rotation during
tensile deformation, changing the number of active slip systems, and, as a
result, the overall stress-strain behavior. The strongest misorientation
effects occurred around the multi-slip orientations of [001], [111], [101], and
[102], while the single slip orientation of [213] showed a negligible effect,
as expected, and the double slip orientation of [112] showed less of an effect
than [102] due to its relative lattice orientation stability. The magnitude of
the misorientation effect increased dramatically with the strength of slip
system interaction, which, in the chosen hardening framework, is represented by
the latent hardening coefficient. In a case study on [001] Cu, offsets of
0.3-2.0 degrees gave stress values at an engineering strain of 0.25 that were
lower by 15-18% relative to the direct loading values, highlighting the
importance of exact orientations for single crystal plasticity parameterization
and application.

<h3>Effect of particle size on the phase transformation behavior and  equation of state of Si under hydrostatic loading</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15092" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15092</a>
<br>
<i>Sorb Yesudhas, Valery I. Levitas, Feng Lin, K. K. Pandey, Maddury Somayazulu</i>
<p>High-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies have been conducted
on three types of Si particles (micron, 100 nm, and 30 nm). The pressure for
initiation of Si-I->Si-II phase transformation (PT) essentially increases with
a reduction in particle size. For 30 nm Si particles, Si-I directly transforms
to Si-XI by skipping the intermediate Si-II phase, which appears during the
pressure release. The evolution of phase fractions of Si particles under
hydrostatic compression is studied. The equation of state (EOS) of Si-I, Si-II,
Si-V, and Si-XI for all three particle sizes is determined, and the results are
compared with other studies. A simple iterative procedure is suggested to
extract the EOS of Si-XI and Si-II from the data for a mixture of two and three
phases with different pressures in each phase. Using previous atomistic
simulations, EOS for Si-II is extended to ambient pressure, which is important
for plastic strain-induced phase transformations. Surprisingly, the EOS of
micron and 30 nm Si are identical, but different from 100 nm particles. In
particular, the Si-I phase of 100 nm Si is less compressible than that of
micron and 30 nm Si. The reverse Si-V->Si-I PT is observed for the first time
after complete pressure release to the ambient for 100 nm particles.

<h3>Ab initio calculation of the nonequilibrium adsorption energy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15103</a>
<br>
<i>Juho Lee, Hyeonwoo Yeo, Ryong-Gyu Lee, Yong-Hoon Kim</i>
<p>While first-principles calculations of electrode-molecule binding play an
indispensable role in obtaining atomic-level understanding in surface science
and electrochemistry, a significant challenge remains because the adsorption
energy is well-defined only in equilibrium. Herein, a theory to calculate the
electric enthalpy for electrochemical interfaces is formulated within the
multi-space constrained-search density functional theory (MS-DFT), which
provides the nonequilibrium total energy of a nanoscale
electrode-channel-electrode junction. An additional MS-DFT calculation for the
electrode-only counterpart that maintains the same bias voltage allows one to
identify the internal energy of the channel as well as the electric field and
the channel polarization, which together determine the electric enthalpy and
the nonequilibrium adsorption energy. Application of the developed scheme to
the water-Au and water-graphene interface models shows that the Au and graphene
electrodes induce very different behaviors in terms of the electrode
potential-dependent stabilization of water configurations. The theory developed
here will be a valuable tool in the ongoing effort to obtain an atomic-scale
understanding of bias-dependent molecular reorganizations in electrified
interfaces.

<h3>Friction and Memory Effects in Homogeneous Gas-Liquid Nucleation: Quest  for Quantitative Rate Calculation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15126</a>
<br>
<i>Subhajit Acharya, Biman Bagchi</i>
<p>The task of a first principles theoretical calculation of the rate of gas to
liquid nucleation has remained largely incomplete despite the existence of
reliable results from unbiased simulation studies at large supersaturation.
Although the classical nucleation theory, formulated by Becker-Doring-Zeldovich
(BDZ) about a century ago, provides an elegant, widely-used picture of
nucleation in a first-order phase transition, the theory finds difficulties in
predicting the rate accurately, especially in the case of gas-to-liquid
nucleation. Here, we use a multiple-order parameter description to construct
the nucleation free energy surface needed to calculate the nucleation rate. A
multidimensional non-Markovian rate theory formulation that generalizes
Langer's well-known nucleation theory by using Grote-Hynes multidimensional
non-Markovian treatment is used to obtain the rate of barrier crossing. We find
good agreement of the theory with the rate obtained by direct unbiased
molecular dynamics simulations, the latter is feasible at large
supersaturation, S. The theory gives the experimentally strong dependence of
the rate of nucleation on supersaturation, S. Interestingly, we find a strong
influence of frequency-dependent friction at the barrier top. This arises from
multiple recrossing of the barrier surface. We find that a Markovian theory,
such as Langer's formulation, fails to capture the rate quantitatively. In
addition, the multidimensional transition state theory expression performs
poorly, revealing the underlying role of friction.

<p>This study investigates the (longitudinal) thermodynamic and structural
characteristics of single-file confined square-well and square-shoulder disks
by employing a mapping technique that transforms the original system into a
one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive rods. Leveraging standard
statistical-mechanical techniques, exact results are derived for key
properties, including the equation of state, internal energy, radial
distribution function, and structure factor. The asymptotic behavior of the
radial distribution function is explored, revealing structural changes in the
spatial correlations. Additionally, exact analytical expressions for the second
virial coefficient are presented. Comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations
demonstrate an excellent agreement with theory.

<br>
<i>Nicolas Gaudy, Mathieu Salanne, Céline Merlet</i>
<p>Molecular dynamics simulations have been used extensively to determine
equilibrium properties of the electrode-electrolyte interface in
supercapacitors held at various potentials. While such studies are essential to
understand and optimize the performance of such energy storage systems,
investigations of the dynamics of adsorption during the charge of the
supercapacitors is also necessary. Dynamical properties are especially
important to get an insight into the power density of supercapacitors, one of
their main assets. In this work, we propose a new method to analyze the
trajectories of adsorbing ions. We focus on pure 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in contact with planar carbon electrodes. We
characterize the evolution of the ion orientation and ion-electrode distance
during adsorption and show that ions reorientate as they adsorb. We then
determine the forces experienced by the adsorbing ions and demonstrate that
Coulomb forces dominate at long range while van der Waals forces dominate at
short range. We also show that there is an almost equal contribution from the
two forces at an intermediate distance, explaining the peak of ion density
close to the electrode surface.

<p>We investigate classes of interacting quantum spin systems in a single-mode

large number of matter entities, we map the relevant low-energy sector of a
broad class of models onto the exactly solvable Dicke model. We apply the
outcomes to the Dicke-Ising model as a paradigmatic example, in agreement with
results obtained by mean-field theory. We further accompany and verify our
findings with finite-size calculations, using exact diagonalization and the

<h3>Global Rotation of Skyrmion Bags under Vertical Microwave Fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15219</a>
<br>
<i>Lan Bo, Rongzhi Zhao, Xichao Zhang, Masahito Mochizuki, Xuefeng Zhang</i>
<p>Magnetic skyrmion bags are composite topological spin textures with arbitrary
topological charges. Here, we computationally study the transient rotational
motion of skyrmion bags, which is characterized by a global rotation of the
inner skyrmions around the central point. Distinct from conventional rotational
modes found in skyrmions, the observed rotation is a forced motion associated
with the breathing mode induced solely by vertical microwave fields. The
driving force behind this rotation originates from the interactions between
outer and inner skyrmions, with the angular velocity determined by the phase
difference resulting from their asynchronous breathing behaviors. It is also
found that skyrmion bags with larger skyrmion numbers are more conducive to the
occurrence of the rotation. Our results are useful for understanding the

<h3>Ballistic vs. diffusive transport in metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15226" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15226</a>
<br>
<i>Yonatan Sivan, Ieng-Wai Un, Subhajit Sarkar</i>
<p>Using the Boltzmann transport model, we show that, somewhat unintuitively,
ballistic transport of electrons in metals is weaker than diffusive transport.
This happens because the femtosecond-scale collision rates of the non-thermal
electrons makes their mean-free path negligible. Our predictions are correlated
with various photoluminescence and nonlinear optics experimental examples both
for Continuous Wave (CW) and pulsed illumination, and open the way to easy
modelling of the non-thermal electron distributions in metal nanostructures of
arbitrary complexity.

<h3>Exact results for non-Newtonian transport properties in sheared granular  suspensions: inelastic Maxwell models and BGK-type kinetic model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15234</a>

<i>Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó</i>
<p>The Boltzmann kinetic equation for dilute granular suspensions under simple
(or uniform) shear flow (USF) is considered to determine the non-Newtonian
transport properties of the system. In contrast to previous attempts based on a
coarse-grained description, our suspension model accounts for the real
collisions between grains and particles of the surrounding molecular gas. The
latter is modeled as a bath (or thermostat) of elastic hard spheres at a given
temperature. Two independent but complementary approaches are followed to reach
exact expressions for the rheological properties. First, the Boltzmann equation
for the so-called inelastic Maxwell models (IMM) is considered. The fact that
the collision rate of IMM is independent of the relative velocity of the
colliding spheres allows us to exactly compute the collisional moments of the
Boltzmann operator without the knowledge of the distribution function. Thanks
to this property the transport properties of the sheared granular suspension
can be \emph{exactly} determined. As a second approach, a
Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (BGK)-type kinetic model adapted to granular
suspensions is solved to compute the velocity moments and the velocity
distribution function of the system. The theoretical results show in general a
good agreement with the approximate analytical results derived for inelastic
hard spheres (IHS) by means of Grad's moment method and with computer
simulations performed in the Brownian limiting case ($m/m_g\to \infty$, where
$m_g$ and $m$ are the masses of the particles of the molecular and granular
gases, respectively). In addition, as expected the IMM and BGK results show
that the temperature and non-Newtonian viscosity exhibit and $S$ shape in a
plane of stress-strain rate (discontinuous shear thickening, DST). The DST
effect becomes more pronounced as the mass ratio $m/m_g$ increases.

<h3>Magnons and fundamental magnetic interactions in a ferromagnetic  monolayer: The case of Ni monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15251</a>
<br>
<i>Khalil Zakeri, Albrecht von Faber, Arthur Ernst</i>
<p>The experimental investigations of the magnetic interactions in an atomically
thin magnetic layer are essential to understand the physics of low-dimensional
magnets. The full spectrum of collective magnetic excitations (magnons) would
provide an access to these fundamental interactions on the atomic scale. Here
in order to be able to excite the magnons by means of spin-polarized electrons
we couple a Ni monolayer to one and two atomic layers of Co and probe the full
experimental magnon dispersion relation up to the Brillouin zone boundary.
Comparing to the results of ab initio calculations we quantify the complex
pattern of the magnetic exchange interaction in the Ni monolayer. We show that
although the magnons in this system are rather stiff, the Heisenberg exchange
coupling between the Ni spins is weak. We unravel the origin of the observed
large magnon stiffness constant being a consequence of the small spin density
of the Ni atoms.

<p>The sponge-like biomineralised calcite materials found in echinoderm
skeletons are of interest in terms of both structure formation and biological
function. Despite their crystalline atomic structure, they exhibit curved
interfaces that have been related to known triply-periodic minimal surfaces.
Here, we investigate the endoskeleton of the sea urchin Cidaris rugosa that has
long been known to form a microstructure related to the Primitive surface.
Using X-ray tomography, we find that the endoskeleton is organised as a
composite material consisting of domains of bicontinuous microstructures with
different structural properties. We describe, for the first time, the
co-occurrence of ordered Primitive and Diamond structures and of a disordered
structure within a single skeletal plate. We show that these structures can be
distinguished by structural properties including solid volume fraction,
trabeculae width, and to a lesser extent, interface area and mean curvature. In
doing so, we present a robust method that extracts interface areas and
curvature integrals from voxelized datasets using the Steiner polynomial for
parallel body volumes. We discuss these very large scale bicontinuous
structures in the context of their function, formation, and evolution.

<h3>Combined thermal and particle shape effects on powder spreading in  additive manufacturing via discrete element simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15271</a>
<br>
<i>Sudeshna Roy, Hongyi Xiao, Vasileios Angelidakis, Thorsten Pöschel</i>
<p>The thermal and mechanical behaviors of powders are important for various
additive manufacturing technologies. For powder bed fusion, capturing the
temperature profile and the packing structure of the powders prior to melting
is challenging due to both the various pathways of heat transfer and the
complicated properties of powder system. Furthermore, these two effects can be
coupled due to the temperature dependence of particle properties. This study
addresses this challenge using a discrete element model that simulates
non-spherical particles with thermal properties in powder spreading. Thermal
conduction and radiation are introduced to a multi-sphere particle formulation
for capturing the heat transfer among irregular-shaped powders, which have
temperature-dependent elastic properties. The model is utilized to simulate the
spreading of pre-heated PA12 powder through a hot substrate representing the
part under manufacturing. Differences in the temperature profiles were found in
the spreading cases with different particle shapes, spreading speed, and
temperature dependence of the elastic moduli. The temperature of particles
below the spreading blade is found to be dependent on the kinematics of the
heap of particles in front, which eventually is influenced by the
temperature-dependent properties of the particles.

<h3>Fractional phase jumps in stochastic systems with tilted periodic  double-well potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15287" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15287</a>
<br>
<i>Martin Žonda, Wolfgang Belzig, Edward Goldobin, Tomáš Novotný</i>
<p>We present a theoretical investigation of the stochastic dynamics of a damped
particle in a tilted periodic potential with a double well per period. By
applying the matrix continued fraction technique to the Fokker-Planck equation
in conjunction with the full counting statistics and master equation
approaches, we determine the rates of specific processes contributing to the
system's overall dynamics. At low temperatures, the system can exhibit one
running state and two distinct locked metastable states. We focus primarily on
two aspects: the dynamics of phase jumps, which are rare thermally induced
particle jumps over potential maxima, and their impact on the overall velocity
noise; and the retrapping process, involving the transition from the running to
the locked metastable states. We demonstrate the existence of fractional (in
units of $2\pi$) phase slips that differ qualitatively from conventional $2\pi$
jumps observed in single-well systems. Fractional phase slips significantly
influence the system dynamics even in regimes dominated by dichotomous-like
switching between running and locked states. Furthermore, we introduce a simple
master equation approach that proves effective in analyzing various stages of
the retrapping process. Interestingly, our analysis shows that even for a
system featuring a well-developed double-well periodic potential, there exists
a broad parameter range where the stochastic dynamics can be accurately
described by an effective single-well periodic model. The techniques introduced
here allow for valuable insights into the complex behavior of the system,
offering avenues for understanding and controlling its steady-state and
transient dynamics, which go beyond or can be complementary to direct
stochastic simulations.

<h3>Vibronics of multi-material nanopillared membranes and impact on the  thermal conductivity</h3>

<br>
<i>Lina Yang, Mahmoud I. Hussein</i>
<p>Atomic motion in nanopillars standing on the surface of a silicon membrane
generates vibrons, which are wavenumber-independent phonons that act as local
resonances. These vibrons couple with heat-carrying phonons traveling along the
base membrane causing a reduction in the in-plane lattice thermal conductivity.
In this work, we examine isolated silicon and gallium nitride nanopillars and
for each compare the vibrons density of states (DOS) to those of phonons in an
isolated uniform silicon membrane. We show that while the phonon-vibron DOS
conformity across the full spectrum is a key factor in reducing the thermal
conductivity of the assembled nanostructure, the presence of an intense vibron
population at more dominant low frequencies plays a competing role. We report
predictions from molecular dynamics simulations showing lower thermal
conductivities for a silicon membrane with gallium-nitride nanopillars compared
to a silicon membrane with silicon nanopillars.

<h3>Structure prediction of stable sodium germanides at 0 and 10 GPa</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15299</a>
<br>
<i>James P. Darby, Angela F. Harper, Joseph R. Nelson, Andrew J. Morris</i>
<p>In this work we used $\textit{ab-initio}$ random structure searching (AIRSS)
to carry out a systematic search for crystalline Na-Ge materials at both 0 and
10 GPa. The high-throughput structural relaxations were accelerated using a
machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) fit to density-functional theory
(DFT) reference data, allowing $\sim$1.5 million structures to be relaxed. At
ambient conditions we predict three new Zintl phases, Na$_3$Ge$_2$, Na$_2$Ge
and Na$_9$Ge$_4$, to be stable and a number of Ge-rich layered structures to
lie in close proximity to the convex hull. The known Na$_\delta$Ge$_{34}$
clathrate and Na$_4$Ge$_{13}$ host-guest structures are found to be relatively
stabilized at higher temperature by vibrational contributions to the free
energy. Overall, the low energy phases exhibit exceptional structural
diversity, with the expected mixture of covalent and ionic bonding confirmed
using the electron-localisation function (ELF). The local Ge structural motifs
present at each composition were determined using Smooth Overlap of Atomic
Positions (SOAP) descriptors and the Ge-K edge was simulated for
representatives of each motif, providing a direct link to experimental x-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Two Ge-rich phases are predicted to be stable at
10 GPa; NaGe$_3$ and NaGe$_2$ have simple kagome and simple hexagonal Ge
lattices respectively with Na contained in the pores. NaGe$_3$ is isostructural
with the MgB$_3$ and MgSi$_3$ family of kagome superconductors and remains
dynamically stable at 0 GPa. Removing the Na from NaGe$_2$ results in the
hexagonal lonsdalite Ge allotrope, which has a direct band gap.

<h3>Ubiquitous short-range order in multi-principal element alloys</h3>

<br>
<i>Ying Han, Hangman Chen, Yongwen Sun, Jian Liu, Shaolou Wei, Bijun Xie, Zhiyu Zhang, Yingxin Zhu, Meng Li, Judith Yang, Wen Chen, Penghui Cao, Yang Yang</i>
<p>Recent research in multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) has increasingly
focused on the exploration and exploitation of short-range order (SRO) to
enhance material performance. However, the understanding of SRO formation and
the precise tuning of it within MPEAs remains poorly understood, limiting the
comprehension of its impact on material properties and impeding the advancement
of SRO engineering. Here, leveraging advanced additive manufacturing techniques
that produce samples with a wide range of cooling rates (up to 10^7 K/s) and an
improved quantitative electron microscopy method, we characterize SRO in three
CoCrNi-based MPEAs to unravel the role of processing route and thermal history
on SRO. Surprisingly, irrespective of the processing and thermal treatment
applied, all samples exhibit similar levels of SRO, suggesting that prevalent
SRO may form during the solidification process. Atomistic simulations of
solidification verify that local chemical ordering arises in the liquid-solid
interface (solidification front) even under the extreme cooling rate of 10^11
K/s. This phenomenon stems from the swift atomic diffusion in the supercooled
liquid, which matches or even surpasses the rate of solidification. Therefore,
SRO is an inherent characteristic of most MPEAs, insensitive to variations in
cooling rates and annealing treatments typically available in experiments.
Integrating thermal treatment with other strategies, such as mechanical
deformation and irradiation, might be more effective approaches for harnessing
SRO to achieve controlled material properties.

<h3>The origin of phase separation in binary aluminosilicate glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15314" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15314</a>
<br>
<i>Houssam Kharouji, Abdellatif Hasnaoui, Achraf Atila</i>
<p>The quest for hard and tough transparent oxide glasses is at the core of
glass science and technology. Aluminosilicate glasses exhibiting nanoscale
phase separation emerge as promising candidates for such materials.
Nevertheless, proper control of the phase separation represents a daunting
challenge due to its elusive origins. Here we employ large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations and structural analysis to unravel the underlying
mechanisms of the phase separation in aluminosilicate. The observed phase
separation originates from an arrangement of SiO$_4$ and AlO$_n$ polyhedra,
which manifests from the second coordination shell and extends to higher
shells. This specific arrangement is driven by repulsion between the polyhedra,
reaching its maximum at around 50 mol% of Al$_2$O$_3$. This behavior becomes
pronounced around and below the glass transition temperature. This work sheds
light on the origin of phase separation and provides a route for further
exploration across other compositions to develop glasses with adapted
mechanical performance.

<h3>Beyond-mean-field stochastic corrections to the blueshift of a  driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensate</h3>

<br>
<i>Félix Helluin, Léonie Canet, Anna Minguzzi</i>
<p>In the absence of vortices or phase slips, the phase dynamics of
exciton-polariton condensates was shown to map onto the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
(KPZ) equation, which describes the stochastic growth of a classical interface.
This implies that the coherence of such non-equilibrium quasi-condensates
decays in space and time following stretched exponentials, characterized by KPZ
universal critical exponents. In this work, we focus on the time evolution of
the average phase of a one-dimensional exciton-polariton condensate in the KPZ
regime and determine the frequency of its evolution, which is given by the
blueshift, i.e. the non-equilibrium analog of the chemical potential. We
determine the stochastic corrections to the blueshift within Bogoliubov
linearized theory and find that while this correction physically originates
from short scale effects, and depends both on density and phase fluctuations,
it can still be related to the effective large-scale KPZ parameters. Using
numerical simulations of the full dynamics, we investigate the dependence of
these blueshift corrections on both noise and interaction strength, and compare
the results to the Bogoliubov prediction. Our finding contributes both to the
close comparison between equilibrium and non-equilibrium condensates, and to
the theoretical understanding of the KPZ mapping.

<i>Hepeng Yao, Luca Tanzi, Laurent Sanchez-Palencia, Thierry Giamarchi, Giovanni Modugno, Chiara D'Errico</i>
<p>Disorder or quasi-disorder is known to favor the localization in many-body
Bose systems. Here in contrast, we demonstrate an anomalous delocalization
effect induced by incommensurability in quasiperiodic lattices. Loading
ultracold atoms in two shallow periodic lattices with equal amplitude and
either equal or incommensurate spatial periods, we show the onset of a Mott
transition not only in the periodic case but also in the quasiperiodic case.
Upon increase of the incommensurate component of the potential we find that the
Mott insulator turns into a delocalized superfluid. Our experimental results
agree with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, showing anomalous delocalization
induced by the interplay between the commensuration and interaction.

<i>Nahuel Nuñez, Enio Lima Jr., Marcelo Vásquez Mansilla, Gerardo F. Goya, Álvaro Gallo-Cordova, María del Puerto Morales, Elin L. Winkler</i>
<p>Ferrite nanoparticles serve as potent heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts,
producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) for decomposing organic pollutants. We
investigated the impact of temperature and copper content on the catalytic
activity of nanoparticles with different oxidation states of iron. Via
solvothermal synthesis, we fabricated copper-doped magnetite
(Cu$_x$Fe$_{3-x}$O$_4$) with a Fe$^{2+}$/Fe ratio ~0.33 for the undoped system.
Using a microwave-assisted method, we produced copper-doped oxidized ferrites,
yielding a Fe$^{2+}$/Fe ratio of ~0.11 for the undoped nanoparticles. The ROS
generated by the catalyst were identified and quantified by electron
paramagnetic resonance, while optical spectroscopy allowed us to evaluate its
effectiveness for the degradation of a model organic dye. At room temperature,
the magnetite nanoparticles exhibited the most $\cdot$OH radical production and
achieved almost 90% dye discoloration in 2 hours. This efficiency decreased
with increasing Cu concentration, concurrently with a decrease in $\cdot$OH
generation. Conversely, above room temperature, Cu-doped nanoparticles
significantly enhance the dye degradation, reaching 100% discoloration at
90$^\circ$C. This enhancement is accompanied by a systematic increase in the
kinetic constants, obtained from reaction equations, with Cu doping. This study
highlights the superior stability and high-temperature catalytic advantages of
copper ferrite holding promise for enhancing the performance of nanocatalysts
for decomposing organic contaminants.

<p>We investigated the structural, elastic, electronic, vibrational, optical,
thermodynamic and a number of thermophysical properties of W2N3 in this study
using DFT based formalisms. The mechanical and dynamical stabilities have been
confirmed. The Pugh and Poisson ratios are located quite close to the brittle
to ductile borderline. The electronic band structure and energy density of
states show metallic behavior. The Fermi surface features are investigated. The
analysis of charge density distribution map clearly shows that W atoms have
comparatively high electron density around than the N atoms. Presence of
covalent bondings are anticipated. High melting temperature and high phonon
thermal conductivity at room temperature of W2N3 imply that the compound has
potential to be used as a heat sink system. The optical characteristics
demonstrate anisotropy for W2N3. The compound can be used in optoelectronic
device applications due to its high absorption coefficient and low reflectivity
in the visible to ultraviolet spectrum. Furthermore, the quasiharmonic Debye
model is used to examine temperature and pressure dependent thermal
characteristics for the first time.

<p>ZnSe and related materials like ZnMgSe and ZnCdSe are promising II-VI host
materials for optically mediated quantum information technology such as single
photon sources or spin qubits. Integrating these heterostructures into photonic
crystal (PC) cavities enables further improvements, for example realizing
Purcell-enhanced single photon sources with increased quantum efficiency. Here
we report on the successful implementation of two-dimensional (2D) PC cavities
in strained ZnSe quantum wells (QW) on top of a novel AlAs supporting layer.
This approach overcomes typical obstacles associated with PC membrane
fabrication in strained materials, such as cracks and strain relaxation in the
corresponding devices. We demonstrate the attainment of the required mechanical
stability in our PC devices, complete strain retainment and effective vertical
optical confinement. Structural analysis of our PC cavities reveals excellent
etching anisotropy. Additionally, elemental mapping in a scanning transmission
electron microscope confirms the transformation of AlAs into AlOx by
post-growth wet oxidation and reveals partial oxidation of ZnMgSe at the etched
sidewalls in the PC. This knowledge is utilized to tailor FDTD simulations and
to extract the ZnMgSe dispersion relation with small oxygen content. Optical
characterization of the PC cavities with cross-polarized resonance scattering
spectroscopy verifies the presence of cavity modes. The excellent agreement
between simulation and measured cavity mode energies demonstrates wide
tunability of the PC cavity and proves the pertinence of our model. This
implementation of 2D PC cavities in the ZnSe material system establishes a
solid foundation for future developments of ZnSe quantum devices.

<i>A. Bertin, L. Kiefer, P. Becker, L. Bohatý, M. Braden</i>
<p>We present temperature-dependent single-crystal diffraction results on seven
antifluorite-type $A_2MeX_6$ compounds with $Me$=Os or Ir: K$_2$OsCl$_6$,
$A_2$OsBr$_6$ with $A$=K, Rb, Cs and NH$_4$, and K$_2$Ir$X_6$ with $X$=Cl and
Br. The structural transitions in this family arise from $MeX_6$ octahedron
rotations that generate a rich variety of symmetries depending on the rotation
axis and stacking schemes. In order to search for local distortions in the
high-symmetry phase we perform refinements of anharmonic atomic displacement
parameters with comprehensive data sets. Even at temperatures close to the
onset of structural distortions, these refinements only yield a small
improvement indicating only small anharmonic effects. The phase transitions in
these antifluorites are essentially of displacive character. However, some
harmonic displacement parameters are very large reflecting soft phonon modes
with the softening covering large parts of the Brillouin zone. The occurrence
of the rotational transitions in the antifluorite-type family can be remarkably
well analyzed in terms of a tolerance factor of ionic radii.

<h3>Interacting electrons in a flat-band system within the Generalized  Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz</h3>

<i>F. Cosco, R. Tuovinen, N. Lo Gullo</i>
<p>This work reports the study of the spectral properties of an open interacting
system by solving the Generalized Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz (GKBA) master equation
for the single-particle density matrix, namely the time-diagonal lesser Green
function. To benchmark its validity, the solution obtained within the GKBA is
compared with the solution of the Dyson equation at stationarity. In both
approaches, the interaction is treated within the self-consistent second-order
Born approximation, whereas the GKBA still retains the retarded propagator
calculated at the Hartree-Fock and wide-band limit approximation level. The
model chosen is that of two leads connected through a central correlated region
where particles can interact and utilize the stationary particle current at the
boundary of the junction as a probe of the spectral features of the system. The
central region is chosen as the simplest model featuring a degenerate ground
state with a flat band. The main result is that the solution of the GKBA master
equation captures well the spectral feature of such system and specifically the
transition from dispersionless to dispersive behavior of the flat-band as the
interaction is increased. Therefore the GBKA solution retains the main spectral
features of the self-energy used even when the propagator is at the
Hartree-Fock level.

<h3>Quantum robustness of the toric code in a parallel field on the  honeycomb and triangular lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15389" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15389</a>
<br>
<i>V. Kott, M. Mühlhauser, J.A. Koziol, K.P. Schmidt</i>
<p>We investigate the quantum robustness of the topological order in the toric
code on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a uniform parallel field. For
a field in $z$-direction, the low-energy physics is in the flux-free sector and
can be mapped to the transverse-field Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. One
finds a second-order quantum phase transition in the 3D Ising$^\star$
universality class for both signs of the field. The same is true for a postive
field in $x$-direction where an analogue mapping in the charge-free sector
yields a ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice
and the phase transition is still 3D Ising$^\star$. In contrast, for negative
$x$-field, the charge-free sector is mapped to the highly frustrated
antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice which
is known to host a quantum phase transition in the 3D XY$^\star$ universality
class. Further, the charge-free sector does not always contain the low-energy
physics for negative $x$-fields and a first-order phase transition to the
polarized phase in the charge-full sector takes place at larger negative field
values. We quantify the location of this transition by comparing quantum Monte
Carlo simulations and high-field series expansions. The full extension of the
topological phase in the presence of $x$- and $z$-fields is determined by
perturbative linked-cluster expansions using a full graph decomposition.
Extrapolating the high-order series of the charge and the flux gap allows to
estimate critical exponents of the gap closing. This analysis indicates that
the topological order breaks down by critical lines of 3D Ising$^\star$ and 3D
XY$^\star$ type with interesting potential multi-critical crossing points. We
further demonstrate that all findings for the toric code on the honeycomb
lattice can be transferred exactly to the toric code on a triangular lattice.

<i>Enugala Sumanth Nani, Thomas Philippe, Mathis Plapp</i>
<p>A phase-field model for diffusion-limited crystal growth is formulated that
is capable of handling highly anisotropic interfaces. It uses a Willmore
regularization that yields corners of finite size. An asymptotic analysis
reveals that Herring's law is recovered for the advancing surfaces. The model
is validated by conducting simulations of dendritic growth for low anistorpies
and comparing the results to the data from the literature. The model makes it
possible to simulate high anisotropy dendrites for which the standard
phase-field models are ill-posed. In this regime, the interplay between a
Herring instability on the dendrite flanks and the corner regularization
creates zig-zag shaped corrugations and leads to a non-monotonic trend of tip
velocity as a function of anisotropy strength.

<p>EuAl$_4$ is a rare earth intermetallic in which competing itinerant and/or
indirect exchange mechanisms give rise to a complex magnetic phase diagram,
including a centrosymmetric skyrmion lattice. These phenomena arise not in the
tetragonal parent structure but in the presence of a charge density wave (CDW),
which lowers the crystal symmetry and renormalizes the electronic structure.
Microscopic knowledge of the corresponding atomic modulations and their driving
mechanism is a prerequisite for a deeper understanding of the resulting
equilibrium of electronic correlations and how it might be manipulated. Here,
we use synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, inelastic X-ray
scattering, and lattice dynamics calculations to clarify the origin of the CDW
in EuAl$_4$. We observe a broad softening of a transverse acoustic phonon mode
that sets in well above room temperature and, at $T_\mathrm{CDW}=142$ K,
freezes out in an atomic displacement mode described by the superspace group
$Immm(00\gamma)s00$. In the context of previous work, our observation is a
clear confirmation that the CDW in EuAl$_4$ is driven by electron-phonon
coupling. This result is relevant for a wider family of BaAl$_4$ and
ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type rare-earth intermetallics known to combine CDW
instabilities and complex magnetism.

<p>Atomistic simulations often rely on interatomic potentials to access greater
time- and length- scales than those accessible to first principles methods such
as density functional theory (DFT). However, since a parameterised potential
typically cannot reproduce the true potential energy surface of a given system,
we should expect a decrease in accuracy and increase in error in quantities of
interest calculated from simulations. Quantifying the uncertainty on the
outputs of atomistic simulations is thus an important, necessary step so that
there is confidence in results and available metrics to explore improvements in
said simulations. Here, we address this research question by forming ensembles
of Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potentials, and using Conformal Prediction
with DFT training data to provide meaningful, calibrated error bars on several
quantities of interest for silicon: the bulk modulus, elastic constants,
relaxed vacancy formation energy, and the vacancy migration barrier. We
evaluate the effects on uncertainty bounds using a range of different
potentials and training sets.

<h3>Specialising Neural-network Quantum States for the Bose Hubbard Model</h3>

<i>Michael Y. Pei, Stephen R. Clark</i>
<p>Projected variational wavefunctions such as the Gutzwiller, many-body
correlator and Jastrow ansatzes have provided crucial insight into the nature
of superfluid-Mott insulator transition in the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) in two
or more spatial dimensions. However, these ansatzes have no obvious tractable
and systematic way of being improved. A promising alternative is to use
Neural-network quantum states (NQS) based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs). With binary visible and hidden units NQS have proven to be a highly
effective at describing quantum states of interacting spin-1/2 lattice systems.
The application of NQS to bosonic systems has so far been based on one-hot
encoding from machine learning where the multi-valued site occupation is
distributed across several binary-valued visible units of an RBM. Compared to
spin-1/2 systems one-hot encoding greatly increases the number of variational
parameters whilst also making their physical interpretation opaque. Here we
revisit the construction of NQS for bosonic systems by reformulating a one-hot
encoded RBM into a correlation operator applied to a reference state, analogous
to the structure of the projected variational ansatzes. In this form we then
propose a number of specialisations of the RBM motivated by the physics of the
BHM and the ability to capture exactly the projected variational ansatzes. We
analyse in detail the variational performance of these new RBM variants for a
10 x 10 BHM, using both a standard Bose condensate state and a pre-optimised
Jastrow + many-body correlator state as the reference state of the calculation.
Several of our new ansatzes give robust results as nearly good as one-hot
encoding across the regimes of the BHM, but at a substantially reduced cost.
Such specialised NQS are thus primed tackle bosonic lattice problems beyond the
accuracy of classic variational wavefunctions.

<h3>Magnetoelectric effect in superconductors with d-wave magnetization</h3>

<i>Alexander A. Zyuzin</i>
<p>We report on a study of the interplay between the supercurrent and
spin-polarization in a two-dimensional superconducting system in the presence
of a d-wave symmetric antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (altermagnetism).
It is demonstrated that the supercurrent exhibits a transverse contribution in
the presence of both constant and momentum-dependent exchange interactions. We
also discuss the analog of the Edelstein effect for such magnetic material,
showing that the induced spin polarization is quadratic in the supercurrent and
d-wave symmetric.

<h3>Original orthorhombic tetrahedral and trigonal hybrid allotropes Cn with  n= 8, 10, 12, 14 possessing ethene -like and propadiene -like units: Crystal  chemistry and first principles</h3>

<i>Samir F.Matar</i>
<p>Original carbon allotropes, orthorhombic C8, C10, C12 and C14 presenting
mixed sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridizations exhibiting ethene like and propadiene
like embedded units are proposed from crystal chemistry and calculations within
the quantum density functional theory DFT. The carbon allotropes with
topologies related with jeb, mog, as well as new topologies, show alternating
tetrahedral and trigonal carbon stacking along the a orthorhombic direction
(vertical) close to but different from isoglitter. The carbon allotropes were
shown to be cohesive and stable both mechanically (elastic properties) and
dynamically (phonons), with calculated Vickers hardness (HV) magnitudes ranging
between 25 GPa and 52 GPa, the latter magnitude assigned to C12 possessing the
largest number of tetrahedral versus trigonal stacking. High phonon frequencies
close to 50 THz were attributed to stretching mode of ethene (in C8 and C12)
and propadiene (in C10 and C14) components with good agreement with experiment
for Raman molecular C double bond C intense stretching mode. Frequencies close
to 40 THz were proposed as signatures of C...C simple bonds in the tetrahedra.
The electronic band structure and electronic density of states DOS shown
exemplarily for C8 point to metallic-like behavior assigned to the itinerant
role of trigonal carbon pi-electrons.

<i>Zach D. Merino, Bohdan Khromets, Jonathan Baugh</i>
<p>In this study, we address challenges in designing quantum information
processors based on electron spin qubits in electrostatically-defined quantum
dots (QDs). Numerical calculations of charge stability diagrams are presented
for a realistic double QD device geometry. These methods generaize to linear QD
arrays, and are based on determining the effective parameters of a Hubbard
model Hamiltonian that is then diagonalized to find the many-electron ground
state energy. These calculations enable the identification of gate voltage
ranges that maintain desired charge states during qubit manipulation, and also
account for electrical cross-talk between QDs. As a result, the methods
presented here promise to be a valuable tool for developing scalable spin qubit
quantum processors.

<h3>Measurements of the first-flux-penetration field in surface-treated and  coated Nb: Distinguishing between surface pinning and an interface energy  barrier</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15500" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15500</a>

<i>Md Asaduzzaman, Ryan M. L. McFadden, Edward Thoeng, Robert E. Laxdal, Tobias Junginger</i>
<p>We report measurements of the first-flux-penetration field in surface-treated
and coated Nb samples using muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR). Using thin Ag foils
as energy moderators for the implanted muon spin-probes, we "profile" the
vortex penetration field $\mu_{0} H_{\mathrm{vp}}$ at sub-surface depths on the
order of $\sim 10$ $\mathrm{\mu}$m to $\sim 100$ $\mathrm{\mu}$m. In a coated
sample [Nb$_3$Sn(2 $\mathrm{\mu}$m)/Nb], we find that $\mu_{0} H_{\mathrm{vp}}$
is depth-independent with a value of 234.5(35) mT, consistent with Nb's
metastable superheating field and suggestive of surface energy barrier for flux
penetration. Conversely, in a surface-treated sample [Nb baked in vacuum at 120
$^{\circ}$C for 48 h], vortex penetration onsets close to pure Nb's lower
critical field $\mu_{0}H_\mathrm{c1} \approx 170$ mT, but increases with
increasing implantation depth, consistent with flux-pinning localized at the
surface. The implication of these results for technical applications of
superconducting Nb, such as superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, is
discussed.

<h3>Electrical Scanning Probe Microscope Measurements Reveal Surprisingly  High Dark Conductivity in Y6 and PM6:Y6 and Non-Langevin Recombination in  PM6:Y6</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15501" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15501</a>

<i>Rachael L. Cohn, Christopher A. Petroff, Virginia E. McGhee, John A. Marohn</i>
<p>We used broadband local dielectric spectroscopy (BLDS), an electric force
microscopy technique, to make non-contact measurements of conductivity in the
dark and under illumination of PM6:Y6 and Y6 prepared on ITO and PEDOT:PSS/ITO.
Over a range of illumination intensities, BLDS spectra were acquired and fit to
an impedance model of the tip-sample interaction to obtain a sample resistance
and capacitance. By comparing two descriptions of cantilever friction, an
impedance model and a microscopic model, we connected the sample resistance
inferred from impedance modeling to a microscopic sample conductivity. A charge
recombination rate was estimated from plots of the conductivity versus light
intensity and found to be sub-Langevin. The dark conductivity was orders of
magnitude higher than expected from Fermi-level equilibration of the PM6:Y6
with the substrate, suggesting that dark carriers may be a source of
open-circuit voltage loss in PM6:Y6.

<h3>Tensor network simulations for non-orientable surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15507</a>

<i>Haruki Shimizu, Atsushi Ueda</i>
<p>In this study, we explore the geometric construction of the Klein bottle and
the real projective plane ($\mathrm{RP}^2$) within the framework of tensor
networks, focusing on the implementation of crosscap and rainbow boundaries.
Previous investigations have applied boundary matrix product state (MPS)
techniques to study these boundaries. We introduce a novel approach that
incorporates such boundaries into the tensor renormalization group (TRG)
methodology, facilitated by an efficient representation of the spatial
reflection operator. This advancement enables us to compute the crosscap and
rainbow free energy terms and the one-point function on $\mathrm{RP}^2$ with
enhanced efficiency and for larger system sizes. Additionally, our method is
capable of calculating the partition function under isotropic conditions of
space and imaginary time. The versatility of this approach is further
underscored by its applicability to constructing other (un)orientable surfaces
of higher genus.
