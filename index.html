<h3>Fluctuations and Persistence in Quantum Diffusion on Regular Lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06022" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06022</a>
<br>
<i>Cheng Ma, Omar Malik, G. Korniss</i>
<p>We investigate quantum persistence by analyzing amplitude and phase
fluctuations of the wave function governed by the time-dependent free-particle
Schr\"odinger equation. The quantum system is initialized with local random
uncorrelated Gaussian amplitude and phase fluctuations. In analogy with
classical diffusion, the persistence probability is defined as the probability
that the local (amplitude or phase) fluctuations have not changed sign up to
time $t$. Our results show that the persistence probability in quantum
diffusion exhibits exponential-like tails. More specifically, in $d=1$ the
persistence probability decays in a stretched exponential fashion, while in
$d=2$ and $d=3$ as an exponential. We also provide some insights by analyzing
the two-point spatial and temporal correlation functions in the limit of small
fluctuations. In particular, in the long-time limit, the temporal correlation
functions for both local amplitude and phase fluctuations become
time-homogeneous, i.e., the zero-crossing events correspond to those of a
stationary Gaussian process, with sufficiently fast-decaying power-law tail of
its autocorrelation function, implying an exponential-like tail of the
persistence probabilities.

<h3>A Small Step for Epitaxy, a Large Step Towards Twist Angle Control in 2D  Heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06029" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06029</a>

<i>Oliver Maßmeyer, Jürgen Belz, Badrosadat Ojaghi Dogahe, Maximilian Widemann, Robin Günkel, Johannes Glowatzki, Max Bergmann, Sergej Pasko, Simonas Krotkus, Michael Heuken, Andreas Beyer, Kerstin Volz</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have received a lot of interest over the past
decade. Especially van der Waals (vdW) 2D materials, such as transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and their heterostructures exhibit semiconducting
properties that make them highly suitable for novel device applications.
Controllable mixing and matching of the 2D materials with different properties
and a precise control of the in-plane twist angle in these heterostructures are
essential to achieve superior properties and need to be established through
large-scale device fabrication. To gain fundamental insight into the control of
these twist angles, 2D heterostructures of tungsten disulfide (WS2) and
graphene grown by bottom-up synthesis via metal-organic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) are investigated using a scanning transmission electron
microscope (STEM). Specifically, the combination of conventional
high-resolution imaging with scanning nano beam diffraction (SNBD) using
advanced 4D STEM techniques is used to analyze moir\'e structures. The latter
technique is used to reveal the epitaxial alignment within the WS2/Gr
heterostructure, showing a direct influence of the underlying graphene layers
on the moir\'e formation in the subsequent WS2 layers. In particular, the
importance of grain boundaries within the underlying WS2 and Gr layers for the
formation of moir\'e patterns with rotation angles below 2{\deg} is discussed.

<h3>Small-angle X-ray resonant magnetic scattering at the Co M$_{2,3}$ and  L$_3$ edges observed with photoemission electron microscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06115" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06115</a>
<br>
<i>Alexis Wartelle, Marisel Di Pietro Martínez, Olivier Fruchart, Philippe David, Guillaume Beutier</i>
<p>X-ray magnetic circular dichroism is an efficient contrast mechanism allowing
for a direct sensitivity to magnetization. Combined with an imaging technique
such as photoemission electron microscopy, it has been successfully applied to
high-resolution investigations of ferromagnetic thin films but also of
three-dimensional systems thanks to the transmission-type contrast in their
shadow. Our focus in this work is the wave-optics scattering pattern that can
be observed near such a shadow's rim. Taking advantage of non-uniform magnetic
states present in near-micron-size Co$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$ beads, we first show how
X-ray resonant magnetic scattering affects the Fresnel diffraction at the Co
L$_3$ edge. In order to confirm this observation, we then turn to the Co
M$_{2,3}$ edges. There, we measure magnetic scattering patterns with a
significantly increased spatial extent (due to the larger wavelength), despite
the signal's weakness. The patterns' origin is supported by a comparison
between our experimental data and a simple analytical model, then numerical
simulations.

<h3>Augmentation of the Electron Counting Rule with Ising Model</h3>

<p>On semiconductor growth surfaces, surface reconstructions appear. Estimation
of the reconstructed structures is essential for understanding and controlling
growth phenomena. In this study, the stability of a mixture of two different
surface reconstructions is investigated. Since the number of candidate
structures is enormous, the structures sampled by Bayesian optimization are
analyzed. As a result, the local electron counting (EC) rule alone was found to
be insufficient to explain such stability. Then, augmenting the EC rule, a
data-driven Ising model is proposed. The model allows the evaluation of the
whole enormous number of candidate structures. The approach is expected to be
useful for theoretical studies of such mixtures on various semiconductor
surfaces.

<h3>Thermal transport in fullerene-based molecular junctions: Molecular  dynamics simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06172" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06172</a>
<br>
<i>Joanna Li, Jonathan J. Wang, Dvira Segal</i>
<p>We investigate phonon thermal transport of fullerene-based single-molecule
junctions by employing classical molecular dynamics simulations. The thermal
conductances of fullerene monomers, dimers, and trimers are computed through
three distinct molecular dynamics methods, by following the equilibration
dynamics in one method, and using two other nonequilibrium simulation methods.
We discuss technical aspects of the simulation techniques, and show that their
predictions for the thermal conductance agree. Our simulations reveal that the
thermal conductance of fullerene monomer and dimer junctions are similar, yet
the thermal conductance of trimer junctions is significantly reduced. This
study could assist in the design of high-performing thermoelectric junctions,
where low thermal conductance is desired.

<h3>Orbital optical activity in noncentrosymmetric metals and  superconductors</h3>

<i>Koki Shinada, Robert Peters</i>
<p>We present the optical activity induced by the orbital magnetic moment in
metals and superconductors using Green's function formalization. We show that
an apparent singularity of the optical activity vanishes in the normal state;
however, it remains finite in the superconducting state and is related to the
superconducting Edelstein effect, ensuring the missing area measurement.
Finally, we calculate the optical activity in a model Hamiltonian mimicking
doped transition metal dichalcogenides to investigate its characteristic
spectrum, and we analyze the Kerr effect to discuss a possibility to observe
the optical activity in experiments.

<h3>First-Principles Study of Recombination-Enhanced Migration of an  Interstitial Magnesium in Gallium Nitride</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06214" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06214</a>
<br>
<i>Yuansheng Zhao, Kenji Shiraishi, Tetsuo Narita, Atsushi Oshiyama</i>
<p>The stable and metastable configurations of interstitial Mg in GaN and its
migration energy barriers are studied from first-principles calculations. In
addition to the conventional octahedral (O, global energy minimum) and
tetrahedral (T, metastable) interstitial sites, we discover two new metastable
interstitial complexes with formation energy lower than or close to that of T
configuration but higher than O. Except for Mg at O site which only has +2
charge state, all other configurations also permit charge states +1 or 0. The
minimum migration energy barrier for Mg$^{++}$ between O sites is found to be
1.95 eV. We further find that, when Fermi energy is close to the conduction
band, the migration between O sites via metastable configurations occur through
a recombination-enhanced mechanism in which the charge state changes from +2 at
O site to 0 at metastable sites by consecutive capture of two electrons during
the migration. This process greatly reduces the migration energy barrier to as
low as 1.47 eV. This value is consistent with experiments, and we also discuss
the role of intrinsic defects in the migration of Mg.

<h3>Distinct pressure evolution of superconductivity and charge-density-wave  in kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes</h3>

<i>Ge Ye, Mengwei Xie, Chufan Chen, Yanan Zhang, Dongting Zhang, Xin Ma, Xiangyu Zeng, Fanghang Yu, Yi Liu, Xiaozhi Wang, Guanghan Cao, Xiaofeng Xu, Xianhui Chen, Huiqiu Yuan, Chao Cao, Xin Lu</i>
<p>It is intriguing to explore the coexistence and (or) competition between
charge-density-wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in many correlated
electron systems, such as cuprates, organic superconductors and
dichacolgenides. Among them, the recently discovered $\mathbb{Z} _2$
topological kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) serve as an ideal platform
to study the intricate relation between them. Here, we report the electrical
resistance measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes ($\approx$ 60 nm) under
hydrostatic pressure up to 2.12 GPa to compare its pressure phase diagram of
CDW and SC with its bulk form. Even though the CDW transition temperature
(T$_{CDW}$) in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes is still monotonically suppressed
under pressure and totally vanishes at P$_2$=1.83 GPa similar to the bulk, the
superconducting transition temperature (T$_c$) shows an initial decrease and
consequent increase up to its maximum $\sim$ 8.03 K at P$_2$, in sharp contrast
with the M-shaped double domes in the bulk CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our results suggest
the important role of reduced dimensionality on the CDW state and its interplay
with the SC, offering a new perspective to explore the exotic nature of
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

<h3>Quasi van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of GaAsSb Nanowires on Graphitic  Substrate for Photonic Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06254</a>
<br>
<i>Dingding Ren, Tron A. Nilsen, Julie S. Nilsen, Lyubomir Ahtapodov, Anjan Mukherjee, Yang Li, Antonius T. J. van Helvoort, Helge Weman, Bjørn-Ove Fimland</i>
<p>III-V semiconductor nanowires are considered promising building blocks for
advanced photonic devices. One of the key advantages is that the lattice
mismatch can easily be accommodated in 1D structures, resulting in superior
heteroepitaxial quality compared to thin films. However, few reports break the
limitation of using bulk crystalline materials as substrates for epitaxial
growth of high-quality photonic 1D components, making monolithic integration of
III-V components on arbitrary substrates challenging. In this work, we show
that the growth of self-catalyzed GaAsSb nanowires on graphitic substrates can
be promoted by creating step edges of monolayer thickness on kish graphite
before the growth. By further alternating the deposition sequence of the
group-III element Al and the group-V elements As and Sb, it was found that
triangular crystallites form when Al is deposited first. This indicates that
the surface binding energy between the graphitic surface and the III-V nucleus
profoundly influences the epitaxial growth of III-V materials on graphitic
surfaces. Using the optimized growth recipe with an AlAsSb buffer nuclei,
vertical [111]-oriented GaAsSb/GaAs nanowires with GaAsSb-based multiple axial
superlattices were grown on exfoliated graphite, which was attached to a (001)
AlAs/GaAs distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) using the simple Scotch tape
method. Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonance modes were observed under optical excitation
at room temperature, indicating a successful monolithic integration with
optical feedback from the DBR system. These results demonstrate the great
potential for flexible integration of high-efficiency III-V nanowire photonic
devices on arbitrary photonic platforms using a 2D material buffer layer, e.g.,
graphene, without breaking the orientation registry.

<h3>Bayesian Committee Machine Potential for Isothermal-Isobaric Molecular  Dynamics Simulations</h3>

<br>
<i>Soohaeng Yoo Willow, Chang Woo Myung</i>
<p>In recent advancements in material simulations, the utilization of Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (SGPR)-based machine learning potentials (MLPs) has
proven to be highly successful in diverse applications such as catalysis,
batteries, and solar cells. In the context of isothermal and isobaric molecular
dynamics simulations, achieving precise pressure estimates is crucial for an
accurate understanding of the system behavior under constant pressure
conditions. In this study, we introduce a novel kernel function designed for
estimating the virial term, a critical component for pressure calculations in
materials simulations. Our study reveals that the inclusion of a virial
prediction in the kernel function leads to significantly improved accuracy in
calculating the stress of a system. We present a kernel-based ML potential that
can be estimated via the Bayesian Committee Machine without the need for
additional training. This improvement allows us to calculate the melting
temperature of ice through Isobaric-Isenthalpy $NpH$ molecular dynamics
simulations of ice-liquid coexisting phases, employing the BCM potential.

<h3>Rational Design of Molybdenum Transition-Metal subnanoclusters catalysts  with Particle Swarm Optimization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06265" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06265</a>
<br>
<i>Yao Wei, Alejandro Santana-Bonilla, Lev Kantorovich</i>
<p>The development of novel sub-nanometer clusters (SNCs) catalysts with
superior catalytic performance depends on the precise control of clusters'
atomistic sizes, shapes, and accurate deposition onto surfaces. Recent
advancements in manufacturing and characterization techniques have paved the
way for the production and atomic resolution characterization of
transition-metal SNCs catalysts, positioning them as a promising new class of
materials for this application. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity of the
adsorption process complicates the ability to achieve an atomistic
understanding of the most relevant structure-reactivity relationships hampering
the rational design of novel catalytic materials. In most cases, existing
computational approaches rely on just a few structures to conclude clusters'
reactivity thereby neglecting the complexity of the existing energy landscapes
thus leading to insufficient sampling and, most likely, unreliable predictions.
Moreover, modelling of the actual experimental procedure that is responsible
for the deposition of SNCs on surfaces is often not done even though in some
cases this procedure may enhance the significance of certain (e.g., metastable)
adsorption geometries. This study proposes a novel approach that utilizes
particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, in conjunction with ab-initio
calculations, to predict the most relevant SNCs structures on a surface in beam
experiments, and consequently their reactivity. To illustrate the main steps of
our approach, we consider the deposition of Molybdenum SNC of 6 Mo atoms on a
free-standing graphene surface, as well as their catalytic properties
concerning the CO molecule dissociation reaction. This study demonstrates the
feasibility of the PSO technique for studying catalyst transition-metal SNCs
and establishes a reliable procedure for performing theoretical rational design
predictions.

<h3>Disorder-Induced Topological Transitions in a Multilayer Topological  Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06280" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06280</a>
<br>
<i>Z.Z. Alisultanov, A. Kudlis</i>
<p>We examine the impact of non-magnetic disorder on the electronic states of a
multilayer structure comprising layers of both topological and conventional
band insulators. Employing the Burkov-Balents model with renormalized tunneling
parameters, we generate phase diagrams correlating with disorder, demonstrating
that non-magnetic disorder can induce transitions between distinct topological
phases. The subsequent section of our investigation focuses on the scenario
where disorder is unevenly distributed across layers, resulting in fluctuations
of the interlayer tunneling parameter -- termed off-diagonal disorder.
Furthermore, we determine the density of states employing the self-consistent
single-site diagram technique, expanding the Green function in relation to the
interlayer tunneling parameter (locator method). Our findings reveal that
off-diagonal disorder engenders delocalized bulk states within the band gap.
The emergence of these states may lead to the breakdown of the anomalous
quantum Hall effect (AQHE) phase, a phenomenon that has garnered significant
attention from researchers in the realm of topological heterostructures.
Nonetheless, our results affirm the stability of the Weyl semimetal phase even
under substantial off-diagonal disorder.

<p>Controlling the flow of excitons between organic molecules holds immense
promise for various applications, including energy conversion, spectroscopy,
photocatalysis, sensing, and microscopy. DNA nanotechnology has shown promise
in achieving this control by using synthetic DNA as a platform for positioning
and, very recently, for also orienting organic dyes. In this study, the
orientation of doubly-linked dyes in DNA origami structures was manipulated to
control energy transfer. By controlling independently the orientation of single
donor and acceptor molecules, the average energy transfer efficiency was
doubled. This work demonstrates the potential of DNA nanotechnology for precise
control of the excitonic energy transfer with implications for artificial
light-harvesting antennas.

<h3>Ubiquitous order-disorder transition in the Mn antisite sublattice of  the (MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ magnetic topological insulators</h3>

<p>Magnetic topological insulators (TIs) herald a wealth of applications in
spin-based technologies, relying on the novel quantum phenomena provided by
their topological properties. Particularly promising is the
(MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ layered family of established intrinsic
magnetic TIs that can flexibly realize various magnetic orders and topological
states. High tunability of this material platform is enabled by
manganese-pnictogen intermixing, whose amounts and distribution patterns are
controlled by synthetic conditions. Positive implication of the strong
intermixing in MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ is the interlayer exchange coupling switching
from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, and the increasing magnetic critical
temperature. On the other side, intermixing also implies atomic disorder which
may be detrimental for applications. Here, we employ nuclear magnetic resonance
and muon spin spectroscopy, sensitive local probe techniques, to scrutinize the
impact of the intermixing on the magnetic properties of
(MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ and MnSb$_2$Te$_4$. Our measurements not
only confirm the opposite alignment between the Mn magnetic moments on native
sites and antisites in the ground state of MnSb$_2$Te$_4$, but for the first
time directly show the same alignment in (MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$
with n = 0, 1 and 2. Moreover, for all compounds, we find the static magnetic
moment of the Mn antisite sublattice to disappear well below the intrinsic
magnetic transition temperature, leaving a homogeneous magnetic structure
undisturbed by the intermixing. Our findings provide a microscopic
understanding of the crucial role played by Mn-Bi intermixing in
(MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ and offer pathways to optimizing the
magnetic gap in its surface states.

<h3>Blackbody heat capacity at constant pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06343" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06343</a>
<br>
<i>E. S. Moreira Jr</i>
<p>At first glance, the title of this work seems to be improper. And the reason
is well known. Since blackbody pressure depends only on temperature, one cannot
take the derivative of the thermodynamic quantities with respect to one of
them, keeping the other constant. That is, the heat capacity at constant
pressure, $C_{P}$, as well as, the coefficient of thermal expansion, $\alpha$,
and the isothermal compressibility, $\kappa_{T}$, are ill-defined quantities.
This work will show that when the perfect conducting nature of the walls of a
blackbody cavity is taken into account, $C_{P}$, $\alpha$ and $\kappa_{T}$ are
in fact well defined, and they are related by the usual thermodynamic
relations, as expected. Two geometries will be considered, namely, a spherical
shell and a cubic box. It will be shown that $C_{P}$, $\alpha$ and $\kappa_{T}$
depend very much on the geometry of the cavity. Issues regarding thermodynamic
stability will be addressed, revealing that they also depend on the cavity's
geometry. It is argued that these findings may be amenable to experimental
verification.

<h3>Wetting ridge dissipation at large deformations</h3>

<br>
<i>Martin H. Essink, Stefan Karpitschka, Hamza K. Khattak, Kari Dalnoki-Veress, Harald van Brummelen, Jacco H. Snoeijer</i>
<p>Liquid drops slide more slowly over soft, deformable substrates than over
rigid solids. This phenomenon can be attributed to the viscoelastic dissipation
induced by the moving wetting ridge, which inhibits a rapid motion, and is
called "viscoelastic braking". Experiments on soft dynamical wetting have thus
far been modelled using linear theory, assuming small deformations, which
captures the essential scaling laws. Quantitatively, however, some important
disparities have suggested the importance of large deformations induced by the
sliding drops. Here we compute the dissipation occurring below a contact line
moving at constant velocity over a viscoelastic substrate, for the first time
explicitly accounting for large deformations. It is found that linear theory
becomes inaccurate especially for thin layers, and we discuss our findings in
the light of recent experiments.

<h3>Plateau-Rayleigh instability of a soft layer coated on a rigid cylinder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06362" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06362</a>
<br>
<i>Bharti, Andreas Carlson, Tak Shing Chan</i>
<p>We study the Plateau-Rayleigh instability of a viscoelastic soft solid layer
coated on a rigid cylinder i.e., a soft fibre with a rigid core. The onset of
instability is examined using a linear stability analysis. We find that
increasing the rigid cylinder radius reduce the growth rate of the fastest
growing mode. For each rigid cylinder radius, a critical elastocapillary number
is found below which all wavelengths of disturbances are stable. The critical
value for a soft fibre with a thick rigid cylindrical core can be several
orders of magnitudes larger than that for a totally soft fibre (no rigid core),
which highlights the strong stabilizing effect of the rigid core on the system.
Increasing the relaxation timescale of the viscoelastic material also slows
down the growth of disturbance, but has no effect on the critical
elastocapillary number. Interestingly, the wavelength of the fastest growing
mode is independent of the rigid cylinder radius for the purely elastic case.

<p>Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense is a microorganism with the ability to
biomineralize magnetite nanoparticles, called magnetosomes, and arrange them
into a chain that behaves like a magnetic compass. Rather than straight lines,
magnetosome chains are slightly bent, as evidenced by electron cryotomography.
Our experimental and theoretical results suggest that due to the competition
between the magnetocrystalline and shape anisotropies, the effective magnetic
moment of individual magnetosomes is tilted out of the [111] crystallographic
easy axis of magnetite. This tilt does not affect the direction of the chain
net magnetic moment, which remains along the [111] axis, but explains the
arrangement of magnetosomes in helical-like shaped chains. Indeed, we
demonstrate that the chain shape can be reproduced by considering an interplay
between the magnetic dipolar interactions between magnetosomes, ruled by the
orientation of the magnetosome magnetic moment, and a lipid/protein-based
mechanism, modeled as an elastic recovery force exerted on the magnetosomes.

<p>A new implementation of many-body calculations is of paramount importance in
the field of computational physics. In this study, we leverage the capabilities
of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body
calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and
tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing
capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a remarkable tenfold
speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. We also
demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a
typical tensor network algorithm. Our findings unambiguously highlight the
significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel

<p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV${}^-$) center in diamond has
shown great potential in nanoscale sensing and quantum information processing
due to its rich spin physics. An efficient coupling with light, providing
strong luminescence, is crucial for realizing these applications. Laser-written
waveguides in diamond promote NV${}^-$ creation and improve their coupling to
light but at the same time induce strain in the crystal. The induced strain
contributes to light guiding but also affects the energy levels of NV${}^-$
centers. We probe NV${}^-$ spin states experimentally with the commonly used
zero-field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). In our waveguides, the
ODMR spectra are shifted, split, and consistently asymmetric, which we
attribute to the impact of local strain. To understand these features, we model
ensemble ODMR signals in the presence of strain. By fitting the model results
to the experimentally collected ODMR data we determine the strain tensor
components at different positions, thus determining the strain profile across
the waveguide. We show that ODMR spectroscopy can be used as a strain imaging
tool. The resulting strain within the waveguide is dominated by a compressive
axial component transverse to the waveguide structure, with a smaller
contribution from vertical and shear strain components.

<p>We demonstrate complete control over dynamics of a single superconducting
vortex in a nanostructure which we coin the Single Vortex Box (SVB). Our device
allows us to trap the vortex in a field-cooled aluminum nanosquare and expel it
on demand with a nanosecond pulse of electrical current. We read-out the vortex
state of the box by testing the switching current of the adjacent Dayem
nanobridge. Using the time-resolving nanothermometry we measure
4$\cdot$10$^{-19}\,$J as the amount of the dissipated heat (which is the energy
of a single red photon) in the elementary process of the vortex expulsion, and
monitor the following thermal relaxation of the device. The measured heat is
equal to the energy required to annihilate all Cooper pairs on the way of the
moving vortex. Our design and measuring protocol are convenient for studying
the stochastic mechanism of the vortex escape from current-driven
superconducting nanowires, which has its roots either in thermal or quantum
fluctuations, similar to ones widely studied in Josephson junctions or magnetic
nanoclusters and molecules. Our experiment enlightens the thermodynamics of the
absorption process in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, in
which vortices are perceived to be essential for a formation of a detectable
hot spot. The demonstrated opportunity to manipulate a single superconducting
vortex reliably in a confined geometry comprises in fact a proof-of-concept of
a nanoscale non-volatile memory cell with sub-nanosecond write and read
operations, which offers compatibility with quantum processors based either on
superconducting qubits or rapid single flux quantum circuits.

<h3>BaMn$_2$P$_2$: Highest magnetic ordering temperature 122-pnictide  compound</h3>

<p>We report the growth of high-quality single crystals of ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type
tetragonal BaMn$_2$P$_2$ and investigation of its structural, electrical
transport, thermal and magnetic properties. Our results of basal plane
electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements show that the compound
has an insulating ground state with a small band gap. Anisotropic
susceptibility $\chi_{ab,c}(T)$ data infer a collinear local-moment N\'eel-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state below the ordering temperature $T_{\rm N}
= 795(15)$~K, which is highest among all the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$- and
CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type 122-pnictide compounds reported so far suggesting that the
strength of magnetic exchange interactions is strongest in this material. The
magnetic transition temperatures of BaMn$_2$$Pn_{2}$ ($Pn$ = P, As, Sb, Bi)
compounds exhibit a monotonic decrease with the increase of tetragonal unit
cell parameters $a$ and $c$, suggesting a strong dependence of the strength of
the decisive magnetic exchange interactions on the separation between the
localized spins residing on the Mn-ions. The observed monotonic increase of
both $\chi_{ab}$ and $\chi_{c}$ for $T > T_{\rm N}$ suggests that short-range
dynamic quasi-two dimensional AFM correlations persist above the $T_{\rm N}$ up
to the highest temperature of the measurements. The large $T_{\rm N}$ of
BaMn$_2$P$_2$ demands for systematic hole-doping studies on this material as
similar investigations on related BaMn$_2$As$_{2}$ with $T_{\rm N} = 618$~K
have led to the discovery of an outstanding ground state where AFM of localized
Mn-spins and itinerant half-metallic ferromagnetism with $T_{\rm c} \approx
100$~K originating from the doped holes coexist together.

<h3>Superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Under Pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06450" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06450</a>
<br>
<i>Chen Lu, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu</i>
<p>Recently, signature of superconductivity (SC) in the trilayer compound
La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has ignited significant interest. In this study, we
propose a trilayer $E_g$ orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model to gain
insights into the superconducting behavior in this material. In the strong
coupling limit, each layer is described by a $t$-$J_{\parallel}$ model with
intra-layer exchange $J_{\parallel}$, while electrons can hop between layers
and interact through inter-layer exchange $J_{\perp}$. Notably, the inner-layer
$3d_{z^2}$-orbital electrons exhibit the potential to form bonding bands with
those in the upper or lower layer. The superconducting behavior is
predominantly driven by the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, resulting in an intra-layer
extended $s$-wave pairing in the outer layers, along with an inter-layer
pairing. Furthermore, electron doping tends to enhance the superconductivity,
while hole doping suppresses it. These findings shed light on the intriguing SC
of La$_{4}$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and its response to charge doping.

<h3>Optical realization of magneto-intersubband oscillations</h3>

<p>We report on the optical realization of the magneto-intersubband oscillations
that have been measured in the sub-terahertz transmittance of a GaAs quantum
well with two subbands occupied. Following their dc analogue, the oscillations
are periodic in the inverse magnetic field with the period governed by the
subband gap. Their magnitude and polarization dependence accurately follow the
presented simplified version of the dynamic magneto-intersubband oscillations
equation that naturally combines dc magneto-intersabband oscillations with
microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIRO). Simultaneously measured
photoresistance also reveals its strong sensitivity to the sign of the circular
polarization, proving the used theoretical modeling.

<h3>Emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance in two-band superconductors with an  incipient quasi-flat band: Enhanced critical temperature evading  particle-hole fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06454" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06454</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroyuki Tajima, Hideo Aoki, Andrea Perali, Antonio Bianconi</i>
<p>In superconductivity, a surge of interests in enhancing $T_{\rm c}$ is ever
mounting, where a recent focus is toward multi-band superconductivity. In
$T_{\rm c}$ enhancements specific to two-band cases, especially around the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover
considered here, we have to be careful about how quantum fluctuations affect
the many-body states, i.e., particle-hole fluctuations suppressing the pairing
for attractive interactions. Here we explore how to circumvent the suppression
by examining multichannel pairing interactions in two-band systems. With the
Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB) formalism for particle-hole fluctuations in a
continuous space, we look into the case of a deep dispersive band accompanied
by an incipient heavy-mass (i.e., quasi-flat) band. We find that, while the GMB
corrections usually suppress $T_{\rm c}$ significantly, this in fact competes
with the enhanced pairing arising from the heavy band, with the trade-off
leading to a peaked structure in $T_{\rm c}$ against the band-mass ratio when
the heavy band is incipient. The system then plunges into a strong-coupling
regime with the GMB screening vastly suppressed. This occurs prominently when
the chemical potential approaches the bound state lurking just below the heavy
band, which can be viewed as a Fano-Feshbach resonance, with its width governed
by the pair-exchange interaction. The diagrammatic structure comprising
particle-particle and particle-hole channels is heavily entangled, so that the
emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance dominates all the channels, suggesting a
universal feature in multiband superconductivity.

<h3>Flexible, photonic films of surfactant-functionalized cellulose  nanocrystals for pressure and humidity sensing</h3>

<i>Diogo V. Saraiva, Steven N. Remiëns, Ethan I. L. Jull, Ivo R. Vermaire, Lisa Tran</i>
<p>Most paints contain pigments that absorb light and fade over time. A robust
alternative can be found in nature, where structural coloration arises from the
interference of light with submicron features. Plant-derived, cellulose
nanocrystals (CNCs) mimic these features by self-assembling into a cholesteric
liquid crystal that exhibits structural coloration when dried. While much
research has been done on CNCs in aqueous solutions, less is known about
transferring CNCs to apolar solvents that are widely employed in paints. This
study uses a common surfactant in agricultural and industrial products to
suspend CNCs in toluene that are then dried into structurally colored films.
Surprisingly, a stable liquid crystal phase is formed within hours, even with
concentrations of up to 50 wt.-%. Evaporating the apolar CNC suspensions
results in photonic films with peak wavelengths ranging from 660 to 920 nm. The
resulting flexible films show increased mechanical strength, enabling a
blue-shift into the visible spectrum with applied force. The films also act as
humidity sensors, with increasing relative humidity yielding a red-shift. With
the addition of a single surfactant, CNCs can be made compatible with existing
production methods of industrial coatings, while improving the strength and
responsiveness of structurally-colored films to external stimuli.

<h3>Thermal transport of glasses via machine learning driven simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06479" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06479</a>
<br>
<i>Paolo Pegolo, Federico Grasselli</i>
<p>Accessing the thermal transport properties of glasses is a major issue for
the design of production strategies of glass industry, as well as for the
plethora of applications and devices where glasses are employed. From the
computational standpoint, the chemical and morphological complexity of glasses
calls for atomistic simulations where the interatomic potentials are able to
capture the variety of local environments, composition, and (dis)order that
typically characterize glassy phases. Machine-learning potentials (MLPs) are
emerging as a valid alternative to computationally expensive ab initio
simulations, inevitably run on very small samples which cannot account for
disorder at different scales, as well as to empirical force fields, fast but
often reliable only in a narrow portion of the thermodynamic and composition
phase diagrams. In this article, we make the point on the use of MLPs to
compute the thermal conductivity of glasses, through a review of recent
theoretical and computational tools and a series of numerical applications on
vitreous silica and vitreous silicon, both pure and intercalated with lithium.

<h3>Anomalous thermal relaxation and pump-probe spectroscopy of 2D  topologically ordered systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Max McGinley, Michele Fava, S. A. Parameswaran</i>
<p>We study the behaviour of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic quantities in
two-dimensional topologically ordered systems, which host anyonic excitations
exhibiting fractional statistics. We highlight the role that braiding phases
between anyons have on the dynamics of such quasiparticles, which as we show
dictates the behaviour of both linear response coefficients at finite
temperatures, as well as nonlinear pump-probe response coefficients. These
quantities, which act as probes of temporal correlations in the system, are
shown to obey distinctive universal forms at sufficiently long timescales. As
well as providing an experimentally measurable fingerprint of anyonic
statistics, the universal behaviour that we find also demonstrates anomalously
fast thermal relaxation: correlation functions decay as a `squished
exponential' $C(t) \sim \exp(-[t/\tau]^{3/2})$ at long times. We attribute this
unusual asymptotic form to the nonlocal nature of interactions between anyons,
which allows relaxation to occur much faster than in systems with
quasiparticles interacting via local, non-statistical interactions. While our
results apply to any Abelian or non-Abelian topological phase in
two-dimensions, we discuss in particular the implications for candidate quantum
spin liquid materials, wherein the relevant quantities can be measured using
pre-existing time-resolved terahertz-domain spectroscopic techniques.

<h3>The role of mobility in epidemics near criticality</h3>

<p>The general epidemic process (GEP), also known as
susceptible-infected-recovered model (SIR), describes how an epidemic spreads
within a population of susceptible individuals who acquire permanent
immunization upon recovery. This model exhibits a second-order absorbing state
phase transition, commonly studied assuming immobile healthy individuals. We
investigate the impact of mobility on disease spreading near the extinction
threshold by introducing two generalizations of GEP, where the mobility of
susceptible and recovered individuals is examined independently. In both cases,
including mobility violates GEP's rapidity reversal symmetry and alters the
number of absorbing states. The critical dynamics of the models are analyzed
through a perturbative renormalization group approach and large-scale
stochastic simulations using a Gillespie algorithm. The renormalization group
analysis predicts both models to belong to the same novel universality class
describing the critical dynamics of epidemic spreading when the infected
individuals interact with a diffusive species and gain immunization upon
recovery. At the associated renormalization group fixed point, the immobile
species decouples from the dynamics of the infected species, dominated by the
coupling with the diffusive species. Numerical simulations in two dimensions
affirm our renormalization group results by identifying the same set of
critical exponents for both models. Violation of the rapidity reversal symmetry
is confirmed by breaking the associated hyperscaling relation. Our study
underscores the significance of mobility in shaping population spreading
dynamics near the extinction threshold.

<p>We study the dynamic structure of lipid domain inclusions embedded within a
phase-separated reconstituted lipid bilayer in contact with a swarming flow of
gliding filamentous actin. Passive circular domains transition into
highly-deformed morphologies that continuously elongate, rotate, and pinch off
into smaller fragments, leading to a dynamic steady state with approximately
23x speed up in the relaxation of the intermediate scattering function compared
to passive membrane domains driven by purely thermal forces. To corroborate
experimental results, we develop a phase-field model of the lipid domains with
two-way coupling to the Toner-Tu equations. We report phase domains that become
entrained in the chaotic eddy patterns, with oscillating waves of domains that
correlate with the dominant wavelengths of the Toner-Tu flow fields.

<h3>Reducing model complexity by means of the Optimal Scaling: Population  Balance Model for latex particles morphology formation</h3>

<p>Rational computer-aided design of multiphase polymer materials is vital for
rapid progress in many important applications, such as: diagnostic tests, drug
delivery, coatings, additives for constructing materials, cosmetics, etc.
Several property predictive models, including the prospective Population
Balance Model for Latex Particles Morphology Formation (LPMF PBM), have already
been developed for such materials. However, they lack computational efficiency,
and the accurate prediction of materials' properties still remains a great
challenge. To enhance performance of the LPMF PBM, we explore the feasibility
of reducing its complexity through disregard of the aggregation terms of the
model. The introduced nondimensionalization approach, which we call Optimal
Scaling with Constraints, suggests a quantitative criterion for locating
regions of slow and fast aggregation and helps to derive a family of
dimensionless LPMF PBM of reduced complexity. The mathematical analysis of this
new family is also provided. When compared with the original LPMF PBM, the
resulting models demonstrate several orders of magnitude better computational
efficiency.

<br>
<i>Loïc Philoxene, Vu Hung Dao, Raymond Frésard</i>
<p>Elucidating the impact of strong electronic correlations on the collective
modes of metallic systems has been of longstanding interest, mainly due to the
inadequacy of the random phase approximation (RPA) in the strongly correlated
regime. In his regard, we analyze the charge excitation spectrum of a Hubbard
model on the face centered cubic lattice, extended with long range
interactions, in different coupling regimes ranging from uncorrelated to the
metal-to-insulator transition at half filling. We argue that the slave boson
representation introduced by Kotliar and Ruckenstein, when formulated in radial
gauge, constitutes a suitable framework to carry out this endeavor, and we
compare its results to conventional RPA as a benchmark. We focus on the
influence of the local and long range couplings on the particle-hole excitation
continuum and the quantum collective phenomena generically comprised in our
spectra, and find numerous qualitative and quantitative discrepancies between
our method and standard RPA in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime. At
the onset of the Mott transition, the plasmon gap is found to vanish,
supporting a quasiparticle description of the mode.

<h3>Coexistence of asynchronous and clustered dynamics in noisy inhibitory  neural networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Yannick Feld, Alexander K. Hartmann, Alessandro Torcini</i>
<p>A regime of coexistence of asynchronous and clustered dynamics is analyzed
for globally coupled homogeneous and heterogeneous inhibitory networks of
quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons subject to Gaussian noise. The
analysis is based on accurate extensive simulations and complemented by a
mean-field description in terms of low-dimensional next generation neural mass
models for heterogeneously distributed synaptic couplings. The asynchronous
regime is observable at low noise and becomes unstable via a sub-critical Hopf
bifurcation at sufficiently large noise. This gives rise to a coexistence
region between the asynchronous and the clustered regime. The clustered phase
is characterized by population bursts in the {\gamma}-range (30-120 Hz), where
neurons are split in two equally populated clusters firing in alternation. This
clustering behaviour is quite peculiar: despite the global activity being
essentially periodic, single neurons display switching between the two clusters
due to heterogeneity and/or noise.

<h3>On the influence of annealing on the compositional and crystallographic  properties of sputtered Li-Al-O thin films</h3>

<br>
<i>Florian Lourens, Detlef Rogalla, Ellen Suhr, Alfred Ludwig</i>
<p>A Li-Al-O thin film materials library, deposited by inert magnetron
sputtering and post-deposition annealing in O2 atmosphere, was used to study
the effects of different annealing temperatures (300 to 850{\deg}C) and
durations (1 min to 7 h) on crystallinity and composition of the films. XPS
depth profiling revealed inhomogeneous compositional depth profiles with Li
contents increased toward the film surface and Al contents toward the
film-substrate interface. These depth profiles were confirmed by a combination
of RBS and D-NRA. At annealing temperatures of 550{\deg}C and higher, Li
reacted with the Si substrate. At the same time, temperatures of 550{\deg}C and
higher enabled the formation of crystalline LiAlO2, whereas at lower
temperatures, no crystalline Li-Al-O phases were detected with XRD. In contrast
to conventional annealing in a tube furnace (3 to 7 h durations), rapid thermal
annealing with fast heating/cooling rates of 10{\deg}C/min and durations of 1
to 10 min resulted in homogeneous depth profiles, while also leading to
crystalline LiAlO2.

<p>Phase transitions are prevalent throughout physics, spanning thermal
phenomena like water boiling to magnetic transitions in solids. They encompass
cosmological phase transitions in the early universe and the transition into a
quark-gluon plasma in high-energy collisions. Quantum phase transitions,
particularly intriguing, occur at temperatures near absolute zero and are
driven by quantum fluctuations rather than thermal ones. The strength of the
fluctuations is very sensitive to the dimensionality of the physical systems,
which determines the existence and nature of phase transitions. Low-dimensional
systems often exhibit suppression of phase transitions, while high-dimensional
systems tend to exhibit mean-field-like behavior. The
localization-delocalization Anderson transition stands out among quantum phase
transitions, as it is thought to retain its non-mean-field character across all
dimensions. This work marks the first observation and characterization of the
Anderson transition in four dimensions using ultracold atoms as a quantum
simulator with synthetic dimensions. We characterize the universal dynamics in
the vicinity of the phase transition. We measure the critical exponents
describing the scale-invariant properties of the critical dynamics, which are
shown to obey Wegner's scaling law. Our work is the first experimental
demonstration that the Anderson transition is not mean-field in dimension four.

<i>Liam Bernheimer, Hristiana Atanasova, Guy Cohen</i>
<p>Describing the ground states of continuous, real-space quantum many-body
systems, like atoms and molecules, is a significant computational challenge
with applications throughout the physical sciences. Recent progress was made by
variational methods based on machine learning (ML) ansatzes. However, since
these approaches are based on energy minimization, ansatzes must be twice
differentiable. This (a) precludes the use of many powerful classes of ML
models; and (b) makes the enforcement of bosonic, fermionic, and other
symmetries costly. Furthermore, (c) the optimization procedure is often
unstable unless it is done by imaginary time propagation, which is often
impractically expensive in modern ML models with many parameters. The
stochastic representation of wavefunctions (SRW), introduced in Nat Commun 14,
3601 (2023), is a recent approach to overcoming (c). SRW enables imaginary time
propagation at scale, and makes some headway towards the solution of problem
(b), but remains limited by problem (a). Here, we argue that combining SRW with
path integral techniques leads to a new formulation that overcomes all three
problems simultaneously. As a demonstration, we apply the approach to
generalized ``Hooke's atoms'': interacting particles in harmonic wells. We
benchmark our results against state-of-the-art data where possible, and use it
to investigate the crossover between the Fermi liquid and the Wigner molecule
within closed-shell systems. Our results shed new light on the competition
between interaction-driven symmetry breaking and kinetic-energy-driven
delocalization.

<h3>Crossover From Individual to Collective Magnetism in Dense Nanoparticle  Systems: Local Anisotropy Versus Dipolar Interactions</h3>

<p>Dense systems of magnetic nanoparticles may exhibit dipolar collective
behavior. However, two fundamental questions remain unsolved: i) whether the
transition temperature may be affected by the particle anisotropy or it is
essentially determined by the intensity of the interparticle dipolar
interactions, and ii) what is the minimum ratio of dipole-dipole interaction
($E_\text{dd}$) to nanoparticle anisotropy ($K_{\text{ef}}V$, anisotropy
$\times$ volume) energies necessary to crossover from individual to collective
behavior. A series of particle assemblies with similarly intense dipolar
interactions but widely varying anisotropy is studied. The $K_\text{ef}$ is
tuned through different degrees of cobalt-doping in maghemite nanoparticles,
resulting in a variation of nearly an order of magnitude. All the bare particle
compacts display collective behavior, except the one made with the highest
anisotropy particles, which presents ``marginal'' features. Thus, a threshold
of $K_{\text{ef}} V/E_{\text{dd}} \approx 130$ to suppress collective behavior
is derived, in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. This translates
into a crossover value of $\approx 1.7$ for the easily accessible parameter
$T_\text{MAX}$(interacting)$/T_\text{MAX}$(non-interacting) (ratio of the peak
temperatures of the zero-field-cooled magnetization curves of interacting and
dilute particle systems), which is successfully tested against the literature
to predict the individual-like$/$collective behavior of any given interacting
particle assembly comprising relatively uniform particles.

<i>Federico Ghimenti, Ludovic Berthier, Frédéric van Wijland</i>
<p>Equilibrium sampling of the configuration space in disordered systems
requires algorithms that bypass the glassy slowing down of the physical
dynamics. Irreversible Monte Carlo algorithms breaking detailed balance
successfully accelerate sampling in some systems. We first implement an
irreversible event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a model of polydisperse hard
disks. The effect of collective translational moves marginally affects the
dynamics and results in a modest speedup that decreases with density. We then
propose an irreversible algorithm performing collective particle swaps which
outperforms all known Monte Carlo algorithms. We show that these collective
swaps can also be used to prepare very dense jammed packings of disks.

<h3>Linear and Non-Linear Response of Quadratic Lindbladians</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06593" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06593</a>
<br>
<i>Spenser Talkington, Martin Claassen</i>
<p>Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and
bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic
physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response
formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response
properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and
non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to
calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary
driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical
responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3)
steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY
model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there
are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response and the coupling to
these modes decreases as the spin density wavelength increases. In the optical
response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can
decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the
response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second
harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden
in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a
result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart
and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly
interacting closed systems.
