<h3>Pair density wave in doped three-band Hubbard model on square lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11381" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11381</a>

A pair density wave (PDW) is a superconducting (SC) state with spatially
modulated order parameter. Although much is known about the properties of the
PDW state, its realization in microscopic models with divergent susceptibility
has been challenging. Here we report a density-matrix renormalization group
study of a three-band Hubbard model (also known as the Emery model) for
cuprates on long two-leg square cylinders. Upon light doping, we find that the
ground state of the system is consistent with that of a PDW state with mutually
commensurate and power-law SC, charge (CDW) and spin (SDW) density wave
correlations. The SC correlations are dominant between neighboring Cu sites
with d-wave pairing symmetry. Interestingly, we find that the near-neighbor
interactions, especially the near-neighbor attractive $V_{pd}$ interaction
between neighboring Cu and oxygen sites, can notably enhance the SC
correlations while simultaneously suppressing the CDW correlations. For a
modestly strong attractive $V_{pd}$, the SC correlations become
quasi-long-ranged with a divergent PDW susceptibility.

<h3>Energy transfer from tunneling electrons to excitons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11641</a>

<br>
Excitons in optoelectronic devices have been generated through optical
excitation, external carrier injection, or employing pre-existing charges.
Here, we reveal a new way to electrically generate excitons in transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). The TMD is placed on top of a gold-hBN-graphene tunnel
junction, outside of the tunneling pathway. This electrically driven device
features a photoemission spectrum with a distinct peak at the exciton energy of
the TMD. We interpret this observation as exciton generation by energy transfer
from tunneling electrons, which is further supported by a theoretical model
based on inelastic electron tunneling. Our findings introduce a new paradigm
for exciton creation in van der Waals heterostructures and provide inspiration
for a new class of optoelectronic devices in which the optically active
material is separated from the electrical pathway.

<h3>Impact of random alloy fluctuations on the carrier distribution in  multi-color (In,Ga)N/GaN quantum well systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11657" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11657</a>
<br>
<i>Michael O'Donovan, Patricio Farrell, Julien Moatti, Timo Streckenbach, Thomas Koprucki, Stefan Schulz</i>
<br>
In this work, we study the impact that random alloy fluctuations have on the
distribution of electrons and holes across the active region of a (In,Ga)N/GaN
multi-quantum well based light emitting diode (LED). To do so, an atomistic
tight-binding model is employed to account for alloy fluctuations on a
microscopic level and the resulting tight-binding energy landscape forms input
to a drift-diffusion model. Here, quantum corrections are introduced via
localization landscape theory and we show that when neglecting alloy disorder
our theoretical framework yields results similar to commercial software
packages that employ a self-consistent Schroedinger-Poisson-drift-diffusion
solver. Similar to experimental studies in the literature, we have focused on a
multi-quantum well system where two of the three wells have the same In content
while the third well differs in In content. By changing the order of wells in
this multicolor quantum well structure and looking at the relative radiative
recombination rates of the different emitted wavelengths, we (i) gain insight
into the distribution of carriers in such a system and (ii) can compare our
findings to trends observed in experiment. Our results indicate that the
distribution of carriers depends significantly on the treatment of the quantum
well microstructure. When including random alloy fluctuations and quantum
corrections in the simulations, the calculated trends in the relative radiative
recombination rates as a function of the well ordering are consistent with
previous experimental studies. The results from the widely employed virtual
crystal approximation contradict the experimental data. Overall, our work
highlights the importance of a careful and detailed theoretical description of
the carrier transport in an (In,Ga)N/GaN multi-quantum well system to
ultimately guide the design of the active region of III-N-based LED structures.

<h3>Prethermalization and the local robustness of gapped systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11242</a>
<br>
<i>Chao Yin, Andrew Lucas</i>
<br>
We prove that prethermalization is a generic property of gapped local
many-body quantum systems, subjected to small perturbations, in any spatial
dimension. More precisely, let $H_0$ be a Hamiltonian, spatially local in $d$
spatial dimensions, with a gap $\Delta$ in the many-body spectrum; let $V$ be a
spatially local Hamiltonian consisting of a sum of local terms, each of which
is bounded by $\epsilon \ll \Delta$. Then, the approximation that quantum
dynamics is restricted to the low-energy subspace of $H_0$ is accurate, in the
correlation functions of local operators, for stretched exponential time scale
$\tau \sim \exp[(\Delta/\epsilon)^a]$ for any $a<1/(2d-1)$. This result does
not depend on whether the perturbation closes the gap. It significantly extends
previous rigorous results on prethermalization in models where $H_0$ had an
integer-valued spectrum. We infer the robustness of quantum simulation in
low-energy subspaces, the existence of ``scarring" (strongly athermal
correlation functions) in gapped systems subject to generic perturbations, and
the robustness of quantum information in non-frustration-free gapped phases
with topological order.

<h3>Symmetry fractionalization in the gauge mean-field theory of quantum  spin ice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11243" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11243</a>
<br>
<i>FÃ©lix Desrochers, Li Ern Chern, Yong Baek Kim</i>
<br>
Symmetry fractionalization is a ubiquitous feature of topologically ordered
states that can be used to classify different symmetry-enriched topological
phases and reveal some of their unique experimental signatures. Despite its
vast popularity, there is currently no available framework to study symmetry
fractionalization of quantum spin ice (QSI) -- a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid
(QSL) on the pyrochlore lattice supporting emergent photons -- within the most
widely used theoretical framework to describe it, gauge mean-field theory
(GMFT). In this work, we provide an extension of GMFT that allows for the
classification of space-time symmetry fractionalization. The construction
classifies all GMFT Ans\"atze that yield physical wavefunctions invariant under
given symmetries and a specific low-energy gauge structure. As an application
of the framework, we first show that the only two Ans\"atze with emergent
$U(1)$ gauge fields that respect all space-group symmetries are the well-known
0- and $\pi$-flux states. We then showcase how the framework may describe QSLs
beyond the currently known ones by classifying chiral $U(1)$ QSI. We find two
new states described by $\pi/2$- and $3\pi/2$-fluxes of the emergent gauge
field threading the hexagonal plaquettes of the pyrochlore lattice. We finally
discuss how the different ways translation symmetries fractionalize for all
these states lead to unique experimentally relevant signatures and compute
their respective inelastic neutron scattering cross-section to illustrate the
argument.

<h3>Neutron Depolarization due to Ferromagnetism and Spin Freezing in  CePd$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11246</a>
<br>
<i>M. Seifert, P. Schmakat, M. Schulz, P. Jorba, V. Hutanu, C. Geibel, M. Deppe, C. Pfleiderer</i>
<br>
We report neutron depolarization measurements of the suppression of
long-range ferromagnetism and the emergence of magnetic irreversibilities and
spin freezing in CePd$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$ around $x^*\approx0.6$. Tracking the
temperature versus field history of the neutron depolarization, we find clear
signatures of long-range Ising ferromagnetism below a Curie temperature $T_{\rm
C}$ for $x=0.4$ and a spin freezing of tiny ferromagnetic clusters below a
freezing temperature $T_{\rm F1}$ for $x>x^*$. Under
zero-field-cooling/field-heating and for $x>x^*$ a reentrant temperature
dependence of the neutron depolarization between $T_{\rm F2}<T_{\rm F1}$ and
$T_{\rm F1}$ is microscopically consistent with a thermally activated growth of
the cluster size. The evolution of the depolarization as well as the reentrant
temperature dependence as a function of Rh content are consistent with the
formation of a Kondo-cluster glass below $T_{\rm F1}$ adjacent to a
ferromagnetic quantum phase transition at $x^*$.

<h3>Symmetries and field tensor network states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11253" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11253</a>
<br>
<i>Albert Gasull, Antoine Tilloy, J. Ignacio Cirac, GermÃ¡n Sierra</i>
<br>
We study the interplay between symmetry representations of the physical and
virtual space on the class of tensor network states for critical spins systems
known as field tensor network states (fTNS). These are by construction infinite
dimensional tensor networks whose virtual space is described by a conformal
field theory (CFT). We can represent a symmetry on the physical index as a
commutator with the corresponding CFT current on the virtual space. By then
studying this virtual space representation we can learn about the critical
symmetry protected topological properties of the state, akin to the
classification of symmetry protected topological order for matrix product
states. We use this to analytically derive the critical symmetry protected
topological properties of the two ground states of the Majumdar-Ghosh point
with respect to the previously defined symmetries.

<h3>Computational Discovery of Energy-Efficient Heat Treatment for  Microstructure Design using Deep Reinforcement Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11259</a>
<br>
<i>Jaber R. Mianroodi, Nima H. Siboni, Dierk Raabe</i>
<br>
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is employed to develop autonomously
optimized and custom-designed heat-treatment processes that are both,
microstructure-sensitive and energy efficient. Different from conventional
supervised machine learning, DRL does not rely on static neural network
training from data alone, but a learning agent autonomously develops optimal
solutions, based on reward and penalty elements, with reduced or no
supervision. In our approach, a temperature-dependent Allen-Cahn model for
phase transformation is used as the environment for the DRL agent, serving as
the model world in which it gains experience and takes autonomous decisions.
The agent of the DRL algorithm is controlling the temperature of the system, as
a model furnace for heat-treatment of alloys. Microstructure goals are defined
for the agent based on the desired microstructure of the phases. After
training, the agent can generate temperature-time profiles for a variety of
initial microstructure states to reach the final desired microstructure state.
The agent's performance and the physical meaning of the heat-treatment profiles
generated are investigated in detail. In particular, the agent is capable of
controlling the temperature to reach the desired microstructure starting from a
variety of initial conditions. This capability of the agent in handling a
variety of conditions paves the way for using such an approach also for
recycling-oriented heat treatment process design where the initial composition
can vary from batch to batch, due to impurity intrusion, and also for the
design of energy-efficient heat treatments. For testing this hypothesis, an
agent without penalty on the total consumed energy is compared with one that
considers energy costs. The energy cost penalty is imposed as an additional
criterion on the agent for finding the optimal temperature-time profile.

<h3>Hubbard $U$ through polaronic defect states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11341" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11341</a>
<br>
<i>Stefano Falletta, Alfredo Pasquarello</i>
<br>
Since the preliminary work of Anisimov and co-workers, the Hubbard corrected
DFT+$U$ functional has been used for predicting properties of correlated
materials by applying on-site effective Coulomb interactions to specific
orbitals. However, the determination of the Hubbard $U$ parameter has remained
under intense discussion despite the multitude of approaches proposed. Here, we
define a selection criterion based on the use of polaronic defect states for
the enforcement of the piecewise linearity of the total energy upon electron
occupation. The values of $U$ determined in this way are found to be robust
upon variation of the considered state. The corresponding electronic and
structural properties are in good agreement with results from piecewise linear
hybrid functionals. In particular, defect formation energies are well
reproduced, thereby validating the energetics achieved with our selection
criterion. It is emphasized that the selection of $U$ should be based on
physical properties directly associated with the orbitals to which $U$ is
applied, rather than on more global properties such as band gaps. For
comparison, we also determine $U$ through a well-established linear response
scheme finding noticeably different values of $U$ and consequently different
formation energies. Possible origins of these discrepancies are discussed. As
case studies, we consider the self-trapped electron in BiVO$_4$, the
self-trapped hole in MgO, the Li-trapped hole in MgO, and the Al-trapped hole
in $\alpha$-SiO$_2$.

<h3>Influence of imperfections on tunneling rate in $Î´$-layer junctions</h3>

<br>
The atomically precise placement of dopants in semiconductors using scanning
tunneling microscopes has been used to create planar dopant-based devices,
enabling the exploration of novel classical or quantum computing concepts,
which often require precise control over tunneling rates in their operation.
While the geometry of the dopants can be defined to sub-nanometer precision,
imperfections can still play a significant role in determining the tunneling
rates. Here, we investigate the influence of different imperfections in
phosphorous $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions in silicon: variations of
$\delta$-layer thickness and tunnel gap width, interface roughness, and charged
impurities. It is found that while most of the imperfections moderately affect
the tunneling rate, a single charged impurity in the tunnel gap can alter the
tunneling rate by more than an order of magnitude, even for relatively large
tunnel gaps. Moreover, it is also revealed that the tunneling rate strongly
depends on the electrical charge sign of the impurity.

<h3>Microstructural Pattern Formation during Far-from-Equilibrium Alloy  Solidification</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11352" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11352</a>
<br>
<i>Kaihua Ji, Elaheh Dorari, Amy J. Clarke, Alain Karma</i>
<br>
We introduce a new phase-field formulation of rapid alloy solidification that
quantitatively incorporates non-equilibrium effects at the solid-liquid
interface over a very wide range of interface velocities. Simulations identify
a new dynamical instability of dendrite tip growth driven by solute trapping at
velocities approaching the absolute stability limit. They also reproduce the
formation of the widely observed banded microstructures, revealing how this
instability triggers transitions between dendritic and microsegregation-free
solidification. Predicted band spacings agree quantitatively with observations
in rapidly solidified Al-Cu thin films.

<h3>Quench Dynamics of Anyon Tonks-Girardeau Gases</h3>

<br>
We investigate the dynamical evolution of strongly interacting anyons
confined in a weak harmonic trap using the exact anyon-fermion mapping method.
The density profiles, momentum distribution, and the reduced one-body density
matrix are obtained for different statistical parameters. The density profiles
of anyons display the same behaviors irrespective of statistical parameter
during the evolution. As the harmonic trap is turned off suddenly, the momentum
distributions exhibit the symmetric fermion-like behaviour in the long time
evolution. As the trap frequency is quenched, the momentum distribution exhibit
an asymmetry breath mode during the evolution. The reduced one-body density
matrix show the dynamical symmetry broken and reproduced behaviour.

<h3>Ferroelectricity controlled chiral spin textures and anomalous valley  Hall effect in the Janus magnet-based multiferroic heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11394" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11394</a>
<br>
<i>Yingmei Zhu, Qirui Cui, Jinghua Liang, Yonglong Ga, Hongxin Yang</i>
<br>
Realizing effective manipulation and explicit identification of topological
spin textures are two crucial ingredients to make them as information carrier
in spintronic devices with high storage density, high data handling speed and
low energy consumption. Electric-field manipulation of magnetism has been
achieved as a dissipationless method compared with traditional regulations.
However, the magnetization is normally insensitive to the electric field since
it does not break time-reversal symmetry directly, and distribution of
topological magnetic quasiparticles is difficult to maintain due to the drift
arising from external fluctuation, which could result in ambiguous recognition
between quasiparticles and uniform magnetic background. Here, we demonstrate
that electric polarization-driven skyrmionic and uniform ferromagnetic states
can be easily and explicitly distinguished by transverse voltage arising from
anomalous valley Hall effect in the Janus magnet-based multiferroic
heterostructure LaClBr/In2Se3. Our work provides an alternative approach for
data encoding, in which data are encoded by combing topological spin textures
with detectable electronic transport.

<h3>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetic skyrmions induced by  curvature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11399" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11399</a>
<br>
<i>Yonglong Ga, Qirui Cui, Jinghua Liang, Dongxing Yu, Yingmei Zhu, Liming Wang, Hongxin Yang</i>
<br>
Realizing sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in intrinsic
two-dimensional (2D) magnets without any manipulation will greatly enrich
potential application of spintronics devices. The simplest and most desirable
situation should be 2D magnets with intrinsic DMI and intrinsic chiral spin
textures. Here, we propose to realize DMI by designing periodic ripple
structures with different curvatures in low-dimensional magnets and demonstrate
the concept in both one-dimensional (1D) CrBr2 and two-dimensional (2D) MnSe2
magnets by using first-principles calculations. We find that DMIs in curved
CrBr2 and MnSe2 can be efficiently controlled by varying the size of curvature
c, where c is defined as the ratio between the height h and the length l of
curved structure. Moreover, we unveil that the dependence of first-principles
calculated DMI on size of curvature c can be well described by the three-site
Fert-L\'evy model. At last, we uncover that field-free magnetic skyrmions can
be realized in curved MnSe2 by using atomistic spin model simulations based on
first-principles calculated magnetic parameters. The work will open a new
avenue for inducing DMI and chiral spin textures in simple 2D magnets via
curvature.

<h3>Dynamical quantum phase transitions in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate  and criticality enhanced quantum sensing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11415" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11415</a>
<br>

<br>
Quantum phase transitions universally exist in the ground and excited states
of quantum many-body systems, and they have a close relationship with the
nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions, which however are challenging to
identify. In the system of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates, though dynamical
phase transitions with correspondence to equilibrium phase transitions in the
ground state and uppermost excited state have been probed, those taken place in
intermediate excited states remain untouched in experiments thus far. Here we
unravel that both the ground and excited-state quantum phase transitions in
spinor condensates can be diagnosed with dynamical phase transitions. A
connection between equilibrium phase transitions and nonequilibrium behaviors
of the system is disclosed in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We also
demonstrate that near the critical points parameter estimation beyond standard
quantum limit can be implemented. This work not only advances the exploration
of excited-state quantum phase transitions via a scheme that can immediately be
applied to a broad class of few-mode quantum systems, but also provides new
perspective on the relationship between quantum criticality and quantum
enhanced sensing.

<h3>Designing Autonomous Maxwell Demon via Stochastic Resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11419</a>
<br>
<i>Ruicheng Bao, Zhiyu Cao, Jiming Zheng, Zhonghuai Hou</i>
<br>
Autonomous Maxwell demon is a new type of information engine proposed by
Mandal and Jarzynski, which can produce work by exploiting an information tape.
Here, we show that a stochastic resetting mechanism can be used to improve the
performance of autonomous Maxwell demons notably. Generally, the performance is
composed of two important features, the time cost for an autonomous demon to
reach its functional state and its efficacious working region in its functional
state. Here, we provide a set of design principles for the system, which are
capable of improving the two important features. On the one hand, one can drive
any autonomous demon system to its functional periodic steady state at a
fastest pace for any initial distribution through resetting the demon for a
predetermined critical time and closing the reset after that. On the other
hand, the system can reach a new functional state when the resetting is always
on, in which case the efficacious region of the demon being extended
significantly. Moreover, a dual function region in a new phase diagram of the
demon with resetting has been found. Remarkably, in this dual function region
the demon with resetting can realize anomalous output of work and erasure of
information on the tape simultaneously, violating the second law of
thermodynamics apparently. To this question, we derive a new modified Clausius
inequality to restore the second law by taking the cost of resetting into
account.

<h3>Temperature and terahertz frequency dependence of the dielectric  properties of Fe3O4 thin films deposited on Si substrate</h3>

<br>
The Fe$_3$O$_4$/Si films are considered to be promising materials for THz
spintronic applications due to their high temperature magnetic transition and
semiconducting properties. In this article, we present the real part of the
dielectric constant ($\epsilon_1$) and the optical conductivity ($\sigma_1$) of
Fe$_3$O$_4$ films of different thicknesses deposited on Si substrate
(Fe$_3$O$_4$/Si) in the THz range at temperatures 2- 300 K. Although the
magnetization of the films with thickness $\geq$ 115 nm shows a clear change at
the Verwey transition temperature T$_v$ = 121 K, their optical properties in
the THz frequency range are drastically different from each other. We have
shown that $\sigma_1$ is maximum and $\epsilon_1$ is minimum when the
Fe$^{+2}$/Fe$^{+3}$ ratio is equal to 0.54 which is the ratio of Fe+2/Fe+3 for
pure Fe$_3$O$_4$. The $\sigma_1$ reduces and $\epsilon_1$ increases at all
temperatures when the Fe$^{+2}$/Fe$^{+3}$ ratio deviates from 0.54. We have
shown that a slight change in the Fe$^{+2}$/Fe$^{+3}$ ratio can induce large
changes in the optical properties which shall have implications in the
application of the Fe3O4 films in THz spintronics.

<h3>Theory and Experiments of Pressure-Tunable Broadband Light Emission from  Self-Trapped Excitons in Metal Halide Crystals</h3>

<i>Shenyu Dai, Xinxin Xing, Viktor G. Hadjiev, Zhaojun Qin, Tian Tong, Guang Yang, Chong Wang, Lijuan Hou, Liangzi Deng, Zhiming Wang, Guoying Feng, Jiming Bao</i>
<br>
Hydrostatic pressure has been commonly applied to tune broadband light
emissions from self-trapped excitons (STE) in perovskites for producing white
light and study of basic electron-phonon interactions. However, a general
theory is still lacking to understand pressure-driven evolution of STE
emissions. In this work we first identify a theoretical model that predicts the
effect of hydrostatic pressure on STE emission spectrum, we then report the
observation of extremely broadband photoluminescence emission and its wide
pressure spectral tuning in 2D indirect bandgap CsPb2Br5 crystals. An excellent
agreement is found between the theory and experiment on the peculiar
experimental observation of STE emission with a nearly constant spectral
bandwidth but linearly increasing energy with pressure below 2 GPa. Further
analysis by the theory and experiment under higher pressure reveals that two
types of STE are involved and respond differently to external pressure. We
subsequently survey published STE emissions and discovered that most of them
show a spectral blue-shift under pressure, as predicted by the theory. The
identification of an appropriate theoretical model and its application to STE
emission through the coordinate configuration diagram paves the way for
engineering the STE emission and basic understanding of electron-phonon
interaction.

<h3>Microphase separation in neutral homopolymer blends induced by  salt-doping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11467</a>
<br>
<i>Xian Kong, Jian Qin</i>
<br>
Microphase separation in polymeric systems provides a bottom-up strategy to
fabricate nanostructures. Polymers that are reported to undergo microphase
separation usually include block copolymers or polyelectrolytes. Neutral
homopolymers, which are comparatively easy to synthesize, are thought to be
incapable of microphase separation. Here, using a minimal model that accounts
for ion solvation, we show that microphase separation is possible in neutral
homopolymer blends with sufficient dielectric contrast, upon a tiny amount of
salt-doping. The driving force for the microphase separation is the competition
between selective ion solvation, which places smaller ions in domains with
higher dielectric constant, and the propensity for local charge neutrality to
decrease the electrostatic energy. The compromise is an emergent length over
which microphase separation occurs and ions are selectively solvated. The
factors affecting such competitions are explored, including ion solvation
radii, dielectric contrast, and polymer fraction, which point to directions for
observing this behavior experimentally. These findings suggest a low-cost and
facile alternative to produce microphase separation which may be exploited in
advanced material design and preparation.

<h3>Energy Transfer in Stability-Optimized Perovskite Nanocrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11490</a>
<br>
<i>MichÃ¨le G. Greiner, Andreas Singldinger, Nina A. Henke, Carola Lampe, Ulrich Leo, Moritz Gramlich, Alexander S. Urban</i>
<br>
Outstanding optoelectronic properties and a facile synthesis render halide
perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) a promising material for nanostructure-based
devices. However, the commercialization is hindered mainly by the lack of NC
stability under ambient conditions and inefficient charge carrier injection.
Here, we investigate solutions to both problems, employing methylammonium lead
bromide (MAPbBr_3) NCs encapsulated in diblock copolymer core-shell micelles of
tunable size. We confirm that the shell does not prohibit energy transfer, as
FRET efficiencies between these NCs and 2D CsPbBr_3 nanoplatelets (NPLs) reach
73.6%. This value strongly correlates to the micelle size, with thicker shells
displaying significantly reduced FRET efficiencies. Those high efficiencies
come with a price, as the thinnest shells protect the encapsulated NCs less
from environmentally induced degradation. Finding the sweet spot between
efficiency and protection could lead to the realization of tailored energy
funnels with enhanced carrier densities for high-power perovskite NC-based
optoelectronic applications.

This paper presents a numerical study of the asymmetric dumbbell model
consisting of ``molecules'' constructed as two different Lennard-Jones spheres
connected by a rigid bond. In terms of the largest (A) particle radius, we
report data for the structure and dynamics of the liquid phase for the bond
lengths 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, and analogous data for the plastic crystalline
phase for the bond lengths 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. Structure is probed by
means of the AA, AB, and BB radial distribution functions. Dynamics is probed
via the A and B particle mean-square displacement as functions of time and via
the rotational time-autocorrelation function. Consistent with the systems'
strong virial potential-energy correlations, the structure and dynamics are
both found to be isomorph invariant to a good approximation in reduced units,
while they generally vary considerably along isotherms of the same (20%)
density variation. Our findings provide the first validation of isomorph-theory
predictions for plastic crystals for which isomorph invariance, in fact, is
found to apply even better than in the liquid phase of asymmetric dumbbells.

<h3>Charging/discharging mechanism in Mg3Bi2 anode for Mg-ion batteries; The  role of the spin-orbit coupling</h3>

<br>
Using density functional calculations, we examine insertion/extraction of Mg
ions in Mg3Bi2, an interesting Mg-ion battery anode. We found that a (1 1 0)
facet is the most stable termination. Vacating a Mg2+ ion from the octahedral
site is more favourable for both surface and bulk regions of the material.
However, the diffusion barriers among the tetrahedral sites are around 3 times
smaller than those among octahedral sites. Consequently, during the
magnesiation/demagnesiation process, Mg ions first vacate the octahedral sites
and then diffuse through the tetrahedral sites. The spin-orbit interaction
lowers Mg's vacancy formation energy but has a minor effect on diffusion
barriers.

<br>
In the past decade, photoemission orbital tomography (POT) has evolved into a
powerful tool to investigate the electronic structure of organic molecules
adsorbed on (metallic) surfaces. By measuring the angular distribution of
photoelectrons as a function of binding energy and making use of the
momentum-space signature of molecular orbitals, POT leads to an
orbital-resolved picture of the electronic density of states at the
organic/metal interface. In this combined experimental and theoretical work, we
apply POT to the prototypical organic $\pi$-conjugated molecule bisanthene
(C$_{28}$H$_{14}$) which forms a highly oriented monolayer on a Cu(110)
surface. Experimentally, we identify an unprecedented number of 13 $\pi$ and 12
$\sigma$ orbitals of bisanthene and measure their respective binding energies
and spectral lineshapes at the bisanthene/Cu(110) interface. Theoretically, we
perform density functional calculations for this interface employing four
widely used exchange-correlation functionals from the families of the
generalized gradient approximations as well as global and range-separated
hybrid functionals. By analyzing the electronic structure in terms of
orbital-projected density of states, we arrive at a detailed orbital-by-orbital
assessment of theory vs. experiment. This allows us to benchmark the
performance of the investigated functionals with regards to their capability of
accounting for the orbital energy alignment at organic/metal interfaces.

Hawthorn</i>
<br>
Understanding the interplay between charge, nematic, and structural ordering
tendencies in cuprate superconductors is critical to unraveling their complex
phase diagram. Using pump-probe time-resolved resonant x-ray scattering on the
(0 0 1) Bragg peak at the Cu L3 and oxygen K resonances, we investigate
non-equilibrium dynamics of Qa = Qb = 0 nematic order and its association with
both charge density wave (CDW) order and lattice dynamics in
La1.65Eu0.2Sr0.15CuO4. In contrast to the slow lattice dynamics probed at the
apical oxygen K resonance, fast nematicity dynamics are observed at the Cu L3
and planar oxygen K resonances. The temperature dependence of the nematicity
dynamics is correlated with the onset of CDW order. These findings
unambiguously indicate that the CDW phase, typically evidenced by translational
symmetry breaking, includes a significant electronic nematic component.

<h3>Oscillating Solitons and AC Josephson Effect in Ferromagnetic Bose-Bose  Mixtures</h3>

<br>
<i>Sebastiano Bresolin, Arko Roy, Gabriele Ferrari, Alessio Recati, Nicolas Pavloff</i>
<br>
Close to the demixing transition, the degree of freedom associated to
relative density fluctuations of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is
described by a non-dissipative Landau-Lifshitz equation. In the quasi
one-dimensional weakly immiscible case, this mapping surprisingly predicts that
a dark-bright soliton should oscillate when subject to a constant force
favoring separation of the two components. We propose a realistic experimental
implementation of this phenomenon which we interpret as a spin-Josephson effect
in the presence of a movable barrier.

<h3>Nonequilibrium design strategies for functional colloidal assemblies</h3>

<br>
<i>Avishek Das, David T. Limmer</i>
<br>
We use a nonequilibrium variational principle to optimize the steady-state,
shear-induced interconversion of self-assembled nanoclusters of DNA-coated
colloids. Employing this principle within a stochastic optimization algorithm
allows us to discover design strategies for functional materials. We find that
far-from-equilibrium shear flow can significantly enhance the flux between
specific colloidal states by decoupling trade-offs between stability and
reactivity required by systems in equilibrium. For isolated nanoclusters, we
find nonequilibrium strategies for amplifying transition rates by coupling a
given reaction coordinate to the background shear flow. We also find that shear
flow can be made to selectively break detailed balance and maximize probability
currents by modifying the stability of intermediates. For a microphase
consisting of many nanoclusters, we study the flux of colloids hopping between
clusters. We find that a shear flow can amplify the flux without a proportional
compromise on the microphase structure. This approach provides a general means
of uncovering design principles for nanoscale, autonomous, functional materials
driven far from equilibrium.

<h3>Self-diffusion in inhomogeneous granular shearing flows</h3>

<br>
<i>Riccardo Artoni, Michele Larcher, James Jenkins, Patrick Richard</i>
<br>
In this letter, we discuss how flow inhomogeneity affects the self-diffusion
behavior in granular flows. Whereas self-diffusion scalings have been well
characterized in the past for homogeneous shearing, the effect of shear
localization and nonlocality of the flow has not been studied. We therefore
present measurements of self-diffusion coefficients in discrete numerical
simulations of steady, inhomogeneous, and collisional shearing flows of nearly
identical, frictional, and inelastic spheres. We focus on a wide range of dense
solid volume fractions, that correspond to geophysical and industrial shearing
flows that are dominated by collisional interactions. We compare the measured
values first, with a scaling based on shear rate and, then, on a scaling based
on the granular temperature. We find that the latter does much better than the
former in collapsing the data. The results lay the foundations of diffusion
models for inhomogeneous shearing flows, which should be useful in treating
problems of mixing and segregation.

<h3>Solvent quality dependent osmotic pressure of polymer solutions in two  dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11546</a>
<br>
<i>Lei Liu, Changbong Hyeon</i>
<br>
Confined in two dimensional planes, polymer chains comprising dense monolayer
solution are segregated from each other due to topological interaction.
Although the segregation is inherent in two dimensions (2D), the solution may
display different properties depending on the solvent quality. Among others, it
is well known in both theory and experiment that the osmotic pressure ($\Pi$)
in the semi-dilute regime displays solvent quality-dependent increases with the
area fraction ($\phi$) (or monomer concentration, $\rho$), that is, $\Pi\sim
\phi^3$ for good solvent and $\Pi\sim \phi^8$ for $\Theta$ solvent. The osmotic
pressure can be associated with the Flory exponent (or the correlation length
exponent) for the chain size and the pair distribution function of monomers;
however, they do not necessarily offer a detailed microscopic picture leading
to the difference. To gain microscopic understanding into the different surface
pressure isotherms of polymer solution under the two distinct solvent
conditions, we study the chain configurations of polymer solution based on our
numerical simulations that semi-quantitatively reproduce the expected scaling
behaviors. Notably, at the same value of $\phi$, polymer chains in $\Theta$
solvent occupy the surface in a more \emph{inhomogeneous} manner than the
chains in good solvent, yielding on average a greater and more heterogeneous
interstitial void size, which is related to the fact that the polymer in
$\Theta$ solvent has a greater correlation length. The polymer configurations
and interstitial voids visualized and quantitatively analyzed in this study
offer microscopic understanding to the origin of the solvent quality dependent
osmotic pressure of 2D polymer solutions.

<br>
<i>E. C. S. Duarte, E. Sardella, T. T. Saraiva, A. S. Vasenko, R. Zadorosny</i>
<br>
The presence of magnetic fields and/or transport currents can cause
penetration of vortices in superconductors. Their motion leads to dissipation
and resistive state arises, which in turn strongly affects the performance of
superconducting devices such as single-photon and single-electron detectors.
Therefore, an understanding of the dissipation mechanisms in mesoscopic
superconductors is not only of fundamental value but also very important for
further technological advances. In the present work, we analyzed the
contributions and interplay of the dissipative mechanisms due to the locally
induced electric field and an intrinsic relaxation of the superconducting order
parameter, $\Psi$, in mesoscopic samples by using the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory. Although often neglected, we show that the dissipated
energy due to relaxation of $\Psi$ must be taken into account for an adequate
description of the total dissipated energy. The local increase of the
temperature due to vortex motion and its diffusion in the sample were also
analyzed, where the joint effect of thermal relaxation and vortex dynamics
plays an important role for the dissipative properties presented by the
superconducting systems.

<h3>Asymmetry effects on the phases of RKKY-coupled two-impurity Kondo  systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Krzysztof P. WÃ³jcik, Johann Kroha</i>
<br>
In a related work [arXiv:2106.07519] we have shown that in the two-impurity
Anderson (2iA) model with two hosts coupled by spin exchange in the most
symmetric case there are either two phase transitions or none. The phases
comprise the conventional Kondo and RKKY regimes and a novel one, interpreted
as a Kondo-stabilized, metallic quantum spin liquid (QSL). Here we analyze how
various types of asymmetry affect this picture. We demonstrate that the
transitions are robust against the coupling and particle-hole asymmetries,
provided charge transfer is forbidden. This holds true despite the scattering
phase shift at each impurity taking non-universal values. Finally, for an
extended model including charge transfer between the hosts and a small Coulomb
interaction at the host sites directly coupled to impurities, we show that the
presence of charge transfer changes the phase transitions into crossovers.
Provided the inter-host hopping is sufficiently small, this leads to
qualitatively the same physics at non-zero temperature. The relevance of this
model for rare-earth atoms in a metallic host is discussed and potential
experimental setups for observing our findings are proposed.

<br>
Flexibility for interface engineering, and access to all-optical switching of
the magnetization, make synthetic ferrimagnets an interesting candidate for
advanced opto-spintronic devices. Moreover, due to their layered structure and
disordered interfaces they also bear promise for the emerging field of graded
magnetic materials. The fastest and most efficient spin-orbit torque driven
manipulation of the magnetic order in this material system generally takes
place at compensation. Here, we present a systematic experimental and modeling
study of the conditions for magnetization compensation and perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy in the synthetic ferrimagnetic Co/Gd/Co/Gd system. A model
based on partial intermixing at the Co/Gd interfaces of this system has been
developed which explains the experiments well, and provides a new tool to
understand its magnetic characteristics. More specifically, this work provides
new insight in the decay of the Co proximity-induced magnetization in the Gd,
and the role the capping layer plays in the Gd magnetization.

<h3>Asymmetric Roughness of Elastic Interfaces at the Depinning Threshold</h3>

<br>
Roughness of driven elastic interfaces in random media is typically
understood to be characterized by a single roughness exponent $\zeta$. We show
that at the depinning threshold, due to symmetry breaking caused by the
direction of the driving force, elastic interfaces with local, long-range and
mean-field elasticity exhibit asymmetric roughness. It is manifested as a
skewed distribution of the local interface heights, and can be quantified by
using detrended fluctuation analysis to compute a spectrum of local,
segment-level scaling exponents. The asymmetry is observed as approximately
linear dependence of the local scaling exponents on the difference of the
segment height from the mean interface height.

<br>
In this work, we have studied the spin-dependent ballistic transport and
anomalous quantum tunnelling in Bilayer Graphene (BLG) hybrid connected to two
Rashba-Zeeman (RZ) leads under an external electric biasing. We investigated
the transmission and conductance for the proposed system using scattering
matrix formalism and Landauer - Buttiker formula considering a double
delta-like barrier under a set of experimentally viable parameters. We found
that the transmission characteristics are notably different for up and down
spin incoming electrons depending upon the strength of magnetization. Moreover,
the transmission of up and down spin electrons is found to be magnetization
orientation dependent. The maximum tunnelling and conductance can be achieved
by tuning biasing energy and magnetization strength and choosing a material
with suitable Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling (RSOC). This astonishing property of
our system can be utilized in fabricating devices like spin filters. We found
the Fano factor of our system is 0.4 under strong magnetization conditions
while it reduces to 0.3 under low magnetization conditions. Moreover, we also
noticed that the transmission and conductance significantly depend on the
Rashba - Zeeman effect. So, considering a suitable RZ material, the tunnelling
of the electrons can be tuned and controlled.

<h3>First-principles superadiabatic theory for the dynamics of inhomogeneous  fluids</h3>

<br>
<i>S.M. Tschopp, J.M. Brader</i>
<br>
For classical many-body systems subject to Brownian dynamics we develop a
superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) for the description
of inhomogeneous fluids out-of-equilibrium. By explicitly incorporating the
dynamics of the inhomogeneous two-body correlation functions we obtain
superadiabatic forces directly from the microscopic interparticle interactions.
We demonstrate the importance of these nonequilibrium forces for an accurate
description of the one-body density by numerical implementation of our theory
for three-dimensional hard-spheres in a time-dependent planar potential. The
relaxation of the one-body density in superadiabatic-DDFT is found to be slower
than that predicted by standard adiabatic DDFT and significantly improves the
agreement with Brownian dynamics simulation data. We attribute this improved
performance to the correct treatment of structural relaxation within the
superadiabatic-DDFT. Our approach provides fundamental insight into the
underlying structure of dynamical density functional theories and makes
possible the study of situations for which standard approaches fail.

<br>
In the vicinity of the quantum critical point(QCP), thermodynamic properties
diverge toward zero temperature, governed by universal exponents. Although this
fact is well known, how it is reflected in quantum dynamics has never been
addressed before. An ideal laboratory platform to test the issue is the organic
Mott dielectrics because the dielectric degrees of freedom, a quantum electric
dipole, is described by the transverse Ising model which has a QCP. We track
the dynamics of the model by constructing a kinetic protocol based on the
quantum Monte Carlo method. The dynamical susceptibility takes the form of the
Debye function and shows a significant peak-narrowing in approaching a QCP due
to the divergence of the relaxation timescale. It resembles the anomaly of
dielectric constants observed in the organic material kappa-ET2X dimer Mott
insulating phase, indicating that the material is very near the ferroelectric
QCP.

Artificial intelligence is gaining strength and materials science can both
contribute to and profit from it. In a simultaneous progress race, new
materials, systems and processes can be devised and optimized thanks to machine
learning techniques and such progress can be turned into in-novative computing
platforms. Future materials scientists will profit from understanding how
machine learning can boost the conception of advanced materials. This review
covers aspects of computation from the fundamentals to directions taken and
repercussions produced by compu-tation to account for the origins, procedures
and applications of artificial intelligence. Machine learning and its methods
are reviewed to provide basic knowledge on its implementation and its
potential. The materials and systems used to implement artificial intelligence
with electric charges are finding serious competition from other information
carrying and processing agents. The impact these techniques are having on the
inception of new advanced materials is so deep that a new paradigm is
developing where implicit knowledge is being mined to conceive materi-als and
systems for functions instead of finding applications to found materials. How
far this trend can be carried is hard to fathom as exemplified by the power to
discover unheard of mate-rials or physical laws buried in data.

<h3>Nonergodic dynamics of dipolar lattice bosons</h3>

<br>
<i>Adith Sai Aramthottil, Mateusz ÅÄcki, Luis Santos, Jakub Zakrzewski</i>
<br>
Non-ergodic dynamics in many-body interacting systems has recently attracted
much interest. Polar lattice gases present, even in absence of disorder, an
intriguing dynamics, which has been mostly discussed in the hard-core regime.
We show that the dynamics of soft-core dipolar lattice bosons may be remarkably
different. We find that contrary to hard-core dipoles, bosons tend to
delocalize for large inter-site interaction strengths due to the crucial role
played by interaction-induced hopping. Interestingly, the interplay between
bare and interaction-induced tunneling may lead, near a lattice-depth-dependent
value of the dipole strength, to an exact decoupling of the Hilbert space
between ergodic states with at most singly-occupied sites, and the remaining
strongly non-ergodic states. Our results highlight the key role that
density-dependent hopping may play in future experiments on out-of-equilibrium
systems with long-range interactions.

We study the response of spin carriers to the effective field textures
developed in curved one-dimensional circuits subject to the joint action of
Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. By using a quantum network
technique, we establish that the interplay between these two non-Abelian fields
and the circuit's geometry modify the geometrical characteristics of the
spinors, particularly on square circuits, leading to the localisation of the
electronic wave function and the suppression of the quantum conductance. We
propose a topological interpretation by classifying the corresponding spin
textures in terms of winding numbers.

The kagom\'e metals RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ were synthesized both
as polycrystalline powders by heating the elements an argon atmosphere and as

{\AA}, c = 9.065(1) {\AA}). Titanium atoms form a kagom\'e net with bismuth
atoms in the hexagons as well as above and below the triangles. The alkali
metal atoms are coordinated by 12 bismuth atoms and form AlB$_2$-like slabs
between the kagom\'e layers. Magnetic susceptibility measurements with
CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ single crystals reveal Pauli-paramagnetism
and traces of superconductivity caused by CsBi$_2$/RbBi$_2$ impurities.
Magnetotransport measurements reveal conventional Fermi liquid behavior and
quantum oscillations indicative of a single dominant orbit at low temperature.
DFT calculations show the characteristic metallic kagom\'e band structure
similar to that of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with reduced band filling. A symmetry analysis
of the band structure does not reveal an obvious and unique signature of a
nontrivial topology.

By employing a mixed SnO$_2$+Sn source, we demonstrate suboxide molecular
beam epitaxy growth of phase-pure single crystalline metastable SnO(001) thin
films at a growth rate of ~1.0nm/min without the need for additional oxygen.
These films grow epitaxially across a wide substrate temperature range from 150
to 450{\deg}C. Hence, we present an alternative pathway to overcome the
limitations of high Sn or SnO$_2$ cell temperatures and narrow growth windows
encountered in previous MBE growth of metastable SnO. In-situ laser
reflectometry and line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to
investigate the rate of SnO desorption as a function of substrate temperature.
While SnO ad-molecules desorption at Ts = 450{\deg}C was growth-rate
limiting,the SnO films did not desorb at this temperature after growth in
vacuum. The SnO (001) thin films are transparent and unintentionally p-type
doped, with hole concentrations and mobilities in the range of 0.9 to
6.0x10$^{18}$cm$^{-3}$ and 2.0 to 5.5 cm$^2$/V.s, respectively. These p-type
SnO films obtained at low temperatures are promising for back-end-of-line

<br>
Muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) and inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) were used
to investigate the superconducting properties of the filled-skutterudite
compound LaRu$_{4}$As$_{12}$. A two-gap isotropic ($s+s$)-wave model can
explain the temperature dependence of the superfluid density. Zero field
$\mu$SR measurements confirm that the time-reversal symmetry does not break
upon entering the superconducting state. The measurements of lattice dynamics
at 2, 20 and 300 K revealed temperature dependencies of the phonon modes that
do not follow strictly a hardening of phonon frequencies upon cooling as
expected within the quasi-harmonic picture. The 20~K data rather mark a turning
point for the majority of the phonon frequencies. Indeed a hardening is
observed approaching 20~K from above, while for a few branches a weak softening
is visible upon further cooling to 2~K. The observed dispersion relations of
phonon modes throughout the Brillouin zone matches with the DFT prediction
quite closely. Our results point out that cubic LaRu$_{4}$As$_{12}$ is a good
reference material for studying multiband superconductivity, including those
with lower crystallographic symmetries such as iron arsenide-based
superconductors.

Photoluminescence (PL) of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is
strongly influenced by the dielectric environment. The defect states present in
the substrate induces uncontrollable doping in the TMD monolayer and thereby
modifies the PL spectra. There have been enormous efforts to tune and overcome
the effect of inevitable subtract defects in PL spectra, but a proper
understanding and a convenient way are still lacking. Here, we systematically
studied the effect of surface defects by gradually increasing the separation
between WS2 monolayer and substrate. Hence, we could precisely modulate the
exciton and trion contribution in the PL spectra of WS2. The excitation power
dependant measurements on dielectric engineered and patterned substrates helped
us to shed light on the mechanism of PL modulation in monolayer WS2. We have
also studied the influence of the nature of the charge carried by substrate
defects on the PL spectra. These results open a new pathway to modulate and
obtain the desired PL spectra of TMDs by engineering the substrates. Our
findings will be useful for fabricating excitonic interconnects, valleytronic,
and single-photon devices.

We study the quantum information spreading in one-dimensional free-fermion
systems in the presence of localized thermal baths. We employ a nonlocal
Lindblad master equation to describe the system-bath interaction, in the sense
that the Lindblad operators are written in terms of the Bogoliubov operators of
the closed system, and hence are nonlocal in space. The statistical ensemble
describing the steady state is written in terms of a convex combination of the
Fermi-Dirac distributions of the baths. Due to the singularity of the
free-fermion dispersion, the steady-state mutual information exhibits
singularities as a function of the system parameters, akin to dynamical quantum
phase transitions. While the mutual information generically satisfies an area
law, at the singular points it exhibits logarithmic scaling as a function of
subsystem size. By employing the generalized Fisher-Hartwig theorem, we derive
the prefactor of the logarithmic scaling, which depends on the parameters of
the baths and plays the role of an effective "central charge". This is upper
bounded by the central charge governing ground-state entanglement scaling. We
provide numerical checks of our results in the paradigmatic tight-binding chain
and the Kitaev chain.

The Wiener's path integral played a major role in the studies of Brownian
motion (Bm). Here we derive exact path-integral representations for the more
general \emph{fractional} Brownian motion (fBm) and for its time derivative
process -- the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn). These paradigmatic
non-Markovian stochastic processes found numerous applications across the
disciplines, ranging from anomalous diffusion in cellular environments to
mathematical finance. Still, exact path-integral representations for the fBm
and fGn were previously unknown. Our formalism exploits the Gaussianity of the
fBm and fGn, relies on theory of singular integral equations and overcomes some
technical difficulties by representing the action functional for the fBm in
terms of the fGn for the sub-diffusive fBm, and in terms of the first
derivative of the fGn for the super-diffusive fBm. We also extend the formalism
to include external forcing. The path-integral representations open a new
avenue in the studies of the fBm and fGn,just as the Wiener's path integral did
for the standard Bm.

<br>
The observation of flat energy bands in transition metal dichalcogenide
bilayers such as twisted WSe${}_2$ makes those materials interesting prospects
for reproducing the behavior observed in graphene-based systems. We use an
effective Hubbard model providing a description of twisted WSe${}_2$ to explore
the presence of superconductivity, which was previously reported in
experiments. Using both the variational cluster approximation and cluster
dynamical mean-field theory, we predict the existence of chiral
supercondictivity of type $d\pm id$ that can be tuned by the twist angle and by
the application of a perpendicular displacement field, in both electron- and
hole-doped systems.

The generalized Rosenzweig--Porter model arguably constitutes the simplest
random matrix ensemble displaying a non-ergodic delocalized phase, which we
characterize here by using replica methods. We first derive analytical
expressions for the average spectral density in the limit in which the size $N$
of the matrix is large but finite. We then focus on the number of eigenvalues
in a finite interval and compute its cumulant generating function as well as
the level compressibility, i.e., the ratio of the first two cumulants: these
are useful tools to describe the local level statistics. In particular, the
level compressibility is shown to be described by a universal scaling function,
which we compute explicitly, when the system is probed over scales of the order
of the Thouless energy. We confirm our results with numerical tests.

At the cutting edge of materials science, matter is designed to self-organize
into structures that perform a wide range of functions. The past two decades
have witnessed major innovations in the versatility of building blocks, ranging
from DNA on the nanoscale to handshaking materials on the macroscale. Like a
jigsaw puzzle, one can reliably self-assemble arbitrary structures if all the
pieces are distinct, but systems with fewer flavors of building blocks have so
far been limited to the assembly of exotic crystals. Inspired by Nature's
strategy of folding biopolymers into specific RNA and protein structures, here
we introduce a minimal model system of colloidal polymers with programmable DNA
interactions that guide their downhill folding into two-dimensional geometries.
Combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we show that designing the
order in which interactions are switched on directs folding into unique
geometries called foldamers. The simplest alternating sequences ($ABAB$...) of
up to 13 droplets yield eleven foldamers, while designing the sequence and
adding an extra flavor uniquely encodes more than half of the 619 possible
geometries. These foldamers can further interact to make complex supracolloidal
architectures, seeding a next generation of bio-inspired materials. Our results
are independent of the dynamics and therefore apply to polymeric materials with
hierarchical interactions on all length scales, from organic molecules all the
way to Rubik's snakes.

<h3>Influence of incommensurate structure on the elastic constants of  crystalline Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+Î´}$ by Brillouin light scattering  spectroscopy</h3>

Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy was used to probe the
room-temperature elasticity of crystalline high-$T_c$ superconductor
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. A complete set of best-estimate elastic
constants was obtained using established relationships between acoustic phonon
velocities and elastic constants along with a simple expression relating
crystal elastic constant $C_{22}$ to the corresponding constants of the
constituent incommensurate sublattices. This latter relationship, which was
derived and validated in the present work, has important implications for those
studying incommensurate systems as it appears that it may be applied in its
general form to any composite incommensurate crystal. The results obtained in
this work are also consistent with sublattice assignments of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$O$_4$
and CaCu$_2$O$_4$ reported in a previous Brillouin scattering study.

<h3>Universal behavior of highly-confined heat flow in semiconductor  nanosystems: from nanomeshes to metalattices</h3>

<br>
Nanostructuring on length scales corresponding to phonon mean free paths
provides control over heat flow in semiconductors and makes it possible to
engineer their thermal properties. However, the influence of boundaries limits
the validity of bulk models, while first principles calculations are too
computationally expensive to model real devices. Here we use extreme
ultraviolet beams to study phonon transport dynamics in a 3D nanostructured
silicon metalattice with deep nanoscale feature size, and observe dramatically
reduced thermal conductivity relative to bulk. To explain this behavior, we
develop a predictive theory wherein thermal conduction separates into a
geometric permeability component and an intrinsic viscous contribution, arising
from a new and universal effect of nanoscale confinement on phonon flow. Using
both experiments and atomistic simulations, we show that our theory is valid
for a general set of highly-confined silicon nanosystems, from metalattices,
nanomeshes, porous nanowires to nanowire networks. This new analytical theory
of thermal conduction can be used to predict and engineer phonon transport in
boundary-dominated nanosystems, that are of great interest for next-generation
energy-efficient devices.

<h3>Floquet transmission in Weyl/multi-Weyl and nodal-line semimetals  through a time-periodic potential well</h3>

<br>
In mesoscopic physics, the application of a time-periodic drive leads to
novel transport behaviour, which is absent in the static regimes. Here, we
consider a quantum pumping protocol, such that the quasiparticles of
Weyl/multi-Weyl and nodal-line semimetals are subjected to a time-periodic
rectangular potential well. The presence of the oscillating potential of
frequency $\omega$ creates equispaced Floquet side-bands with spacing $\hbar
\omega$. As a result, a Fano resonance is observed when the difference in the
Fermi energy (i.e., the energy of the incident quasiparticle), and the energy
of one of the (quasi)bound state levels of the well, coincides with the energy
of an integer number of photons (each carrying energy quantum $\hbar \omega$,
equal to the side-band spacing). Using the Floquet theory and the scattering
matrix approach in the zero-temperature non-adiabatic pumping limit, we find
characteristic Fano resonance patterns in the transmission coefficients, which
depend on the nature of the dispersion. The inflection points in the pumped
shot noise spectra also serve as a proxy for the corresponding Fano resonances.
Therefore, we also numerically evaluate the pumped shot noise. Finally, we
correlate the existence of the Fano resonance points to the (quasi)bound states
of the well, by explicitly calculating the bound states of the static well
(which are a subset of the bound states of the driven system). Since we
consider semimetals with anisotropic dispersions, all the features observed
depend on the orientation of the potential well. We believe that our results
will serve as a guide for future experiments investigating quantum transmission
in nonequilibrium settings.

In aerospace applications, multiple safety regulations were introduced to
address associated with pyrolysis. Predictive modeling of pyrolysis is a
challenging task since multiple thermo-chemo-mechanical laws need to be
concurrently solved at each time step. So far, classical modeling approaches
were mostly focused on defining the basic chemical processes (pyrolysis and
ignite) at micro-scale by decoupling them from thermal solution at the
micro-scale and then validating them using meso-scale experimental results. The
advent of Machine Learning (ML) and AI in recent years has provided an
opportunity to construct quick surrogate ML models to replace high fidelity
multi-physics models, which have a high computational cost and may not be
applicable for high nonlinear equations. This serves as the motivation for the
introduction of innovative Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to simulate
multiple stiff, and semi-stiff ODEs that govern Pyrolysis and Ablation. Our
Engine is particularly developed to calculate the char formation and degree of
burning in the course of pyrolysis of crosslinked polymeric systems. A
multi-task learning approach is hired to assure the best fitting to the
training data. The proposed Hybrid-PINN (HPINN) solver was bench-marked against
finite element high fidelity solutions on different examples. We developed PINN
architectures using collocation training to forecast temperature distributions
and the degree of burning in the course of pyrolysis in multiple one- and
two-dimensional examples. By decoupling thermal and mechanical equations, we
can predict the loss of performance in the system by predicting the char
formation pattern and localized degree of burning at each continuum.

<h3>Spectrally Selective Thermal Emission from Graphene Decorated with  Metallic Nanoparticles</h3>

We showed in past work that nanopatterned monolayer graphene (NPG) enables
spectrally selective thermal emission in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) from 3 to 12
$\mu$m. In that case the spectral selection is realized by means of the
localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances inside graphene. Here we show that
graphene decorated with metallic nanoparticles, such as Ag nanocubes or
nanospheres, also realize spectrally selective thermal emission, but in this
case by means of acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) localized between graphene
and the Ag nanoparticle inside a dielectric material. Our finite-difference
time domain (FDTD) calculations show that the spectrally selective thermal
radiation emission can be tuned by means of a gate voltage into two different
wavelength regimes, namely the atmospherically opaque regime between
$\lambda=5$ $\mu$m and $\lambda=8$ $\mu$m or the atmospherically transparent
regime between $\lambda=8$ $\mu$m and $\lambda=12$ $\mu$m. This allows for
electric switching between radiative heat trapping mode for the fomer regime
and radiative cooling mode for the latter regime. Our theoretical results can
be used to develop graphene-based thermal management systems for smart fabrics.

Recently reported anomalies in frequency shift of order $\delta f\sim 0.1
-10\,\mbox{kHz}$ for Niobium SRF cavities in a narrow temperature region near
$T_c\simeq 9\,\mbox{K}$ are sensitive to the surface preparation and Nitrogen
doping. We developed methods for calculating the surface current response of Nb
SRF cavities, as well as the resonant frequency shift and quality factor, as
functions of temperature, frequency and disorder based on the Keldysh
formulation of the theory for nonequilibrium superconductivity coupled with
Maxwell's theory and boundary conditions for the response functions and
electromagnetic field. We show that the anomaly is sensitive to impurity
disorder. Our results for the anomaly in the frequency shift are in good
agreement with experimental results for Nb with an anisotropic gap on the Fermi
surface and inhomogeneous non-magnetic disorder. We also show that the quality
factor as a function of the impurity scattering rate is maximum for in SRF
cavities with intermediate disorder, $\hbar/\tau\Delta\sim{\cal O}(1)$ with the
maximum $Q$ decreasing with increasing frequency.

An impurity interacting with an ultracold Fermi gas can form either a polaron
state or a dressed molecular state in which the impurity forms a bound state
with one gas particle. This molecular state features rich physics, including a
first-order transition to the polaron state and a negative effective mass at
small interactions. However, these features have remained so far experimentally
inaccessible. In this work we show theoretically how the molecular state can be
directly prepared experimentally even in its excited state using
state-of-the-art cold atom Raman spectroscopy techniques. Initializing the
system in the ultra-strong coupling limit, where the binding energy of the
molaron is much larger than the Fermi energy, our protocol maps out the
momentum-dependent spectral function of the molecule. Using a diagrammatic
approach we furthermore show that the molecular spectral function serves as a
direct precursor of the elusive Fulde-Ferell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase, which is
realized for a finite density of fermionic impurity particles. Our results pave
the way to a systematic understanding of how composite particles form in
quantum many-body environments and provide a basis to develop new schemes for
the observation of exotic phases of quantum many-body systems.
