<h3>Dynamics of a solitonic vortex in an anisotropically trapped superfluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03569" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03569</a>
<br>
<i>J. M. Gomez Llorente, J. Plata</i>
<br>
<br>
We analytically study the dynamics of a solitonic vortex (SV) in a superfluid
confined in a non-axisymmetric harmonic trap. The study provides a framework
for analyzing the role of the trap anisotropy in the oscillation of SVs
observed in recent experiments on atomic Bose and Fermi superfluids. The
emergence of common and statistics-dependent features is traced in a unified
approach to both types of fluid. Our description, built in the hydrodynamic
formalism, is based on a Lagragian approach which incorporates the vortex
location as dynamical parameters of a variational ansatz. Previous operative
Hamiltonian pictures are recovered through a canonically traced procedure. Our
results improve the understanding of the experimental findings. Some of the
observed features are shown to be specific to the tri-axial anisotropy of the
trap. In particular, we characterize the nontrivial dependence of the
oscillation frequency on the trapping transversal to the vortical line. The
study reveals also the crucial role played by the nonlinear character of the
dynamics in the observed oscillation: for the considered experimental
conditions, the frequency, and, in turn, the effective inertial mass of the
vortex, are found to significantly depend on the amplitude of the generated
motion. It is also uncovered how the coupling with collective modes of the
fluid induces a non-negligible shift in the oscillation frequency. The
appearance of fine-structure features in the SV trajectory is predicted.

<h3>Three-dimensional active turbulence in microswimmer suspensions:  simulations and modelling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03662" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03662</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Active turbulence is a paradigmatic and fascinating example of self-organized
motion at large scales occurring in active matter. We employ massive
hydrodynamic simulations of suspensions of resolved model microswimmers to
tackle the phenomenon in semi-diluted conditions at a mesoscopic level. We
measure the kinetic energy spectrum and find that it decays as $k^{-3}$ over a
range of intermediate wavenumbers. The velocity distributions are of L\'evy
type, a distinct difference with inertial turbulence. Furthermore, we propose a
reduced order dynamical deterministic model for active turbulence, inspired to
shell models for classical turbulence, whose numerical and analytical study
confirms the spectrum power-law observed in the simulations and reveals hints
of a non-Gaussian, intermittent, physics of active turbulence. Direct numerical
simulations and modelling also agree in pointing to a phenomenological picture
whereby, in the absence of an energy cascade \`a la Richardson forbidden by the
low Reynolds number regime, it is the coupling between fluid velocity gradients
and bacterial orientation that gives rise to a multiscale dynamics.

<h3>Spin-momentum Locking and Topological Vector Charge Response with  Conserved Spin</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03301</a>
<br>
<i>Yoonseok Hwang, Penghao Zhu, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin-momentum locking plays a fundamental role in spintronics and, more
broadly, is an important concept in condensed matter physics. In 2D and 3D,
spin-momentum locking typically does not allow spin-conservation because the
spin-1/2 operators of electrons anticommute. Instead, here we study
spin-momentum locking terms with conserved, commuting pseudospins built from a
combination of spin and orbitals. We find that 2D spin-momentum locking terms
with conserved pseudospins generally lead to linearly dispersing modes at
low-energy with anomalous charge and pseudospin currents. To cure the anomaly
we show that such anomalous modes can be realized on the surface of a 3D Weyl
semimetal (or an associated weak topological insulator) with a nonzero mixed
spin-momentum quadrupole moment, which is determined by the momentum location
and pseudospin eigenvalues of Weyl points at the Fermi level. Crucially, this
mixed quadrupole moment captures a mixed pseudospin-charge bulk response that
cancels the anomaly of surface modes, and can generate a giant 3D spin Hall
effect, among other phenomena.

<h3>Enhanced Superconducting Diode Effect due to coexisting Phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03303" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03303</a>
<br>
<i>Sayan Banerjee, Mathias S. Scheurer</i>
<br>
<br>
The superconducting diode effect refers to an asymmetry in the critical
supercurrent $J_c(\hat{n})$ along opposite directions, $J_c(\hat{n})\neq
J_c(-\hat{n})$. While the basic symmetry requirements for this effect are
known, it is, for junction-free systems, difficult to capture within current
theoretical models the large current asymmetries $J_c(\hat{n})/J_c(-\hat{n})$
recently observed in experiment. We here propose and develop a theory for an
enhancement mechanism of the diode effect arising from spontaneous symmetry
breaking. We show - both within a phenomenological and a microscopic theory -
that there is a coupling of the supercurrent and the underlying
symmetry-breaking order parameter. This coupling can enhance the current
asymmetry significantly. Our work might not only provide a possible explanation
for recent experiments on trilayer graphene but also pave the way for future
realizations of the superconducting diode effect with large current
asymmetries.

<h3>Route to turbulence via oscillatory states in polar active fluid under  confinement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03306" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03306</a>
<br>
<i>Sora Shiratani, Kazumasa A. Takeuchi, Daiki Nishiguchi</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a novel route to active turbulence, observed in numerical
simulations of a polar active fluid model under confinement. To deal with
large-scale computations with arbitrary geometries, we developed a GPU-based
scheme that can be used for any boundary shape in a unified manner. For the
circular confinement, as the radius was increased, we found a series of
transitions first from a single stationary vortex to an oscillating pair of
vortices, then through reentrant transitions between oscillatory and chaotic
dynamics before finally reaching the active turbulence. The first transition
turned out to be hysteretic, with the emergence of the oscillatory state
consistent with the subcritical Hopf bifurcation. In dumbbell-shaped boundaries
composed of two overlapping circles, we observed a transition comparable to the
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic vortex-order transition reported in previous
experiments, but the transition point turned out to show a qualitatively
different geometry dependence.

<h3>Superfluid Edge Dislocation: Transverse Quantum Fluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03309" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03309</a>
<br>
<i>Leo Radzihovsky, Anatoly Kuklov, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, it has been argued by Kuklov et al., that unusual features
associated with the superflow-through-solid effect observed in solid He4 can be
explained by unique properties of dilute distribution of superfluid edge
dislocations. We demonstrate that stability of supercurrents controlled by
quantum phase slips (instantons), and other exotic infrared properties of the
superfluid dislocations readily follow from a one-dimensional quantum liquid
distinguished by an effectively infinite compressibility (in the absence of
Peierls potential) associated with the edge dislocation's ability to climb.
This establishes a new class of quasi-one-dimensional superfluid states that
remain stable and long-range ordered despite their low dimensionality. We
propose an experiment to test our mass-current--pressure characteristic
prediction.

<h3>Addressing the spin-valley flavors in moir'e mini-bands of MoS2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03316</a>
<br>
<i>Chithra H. Sharma, Marta Prada, Jan-Hendrik Schmidt, Isabel Gonz'alez D'iaz-Palacio, Tobias Stauber, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Lars Tiemann, Robert H. Blick</i>
<br>
<br>
The physics of moir'e superlattices and the resulting formation of mini-bands
in van der Waals materials have opened up an exciting new field in condensed
matter physics. These systems exhibit a rich phase diagram of novel physical
phenomena and exotic correlated phases that emerge in the low-dispersing bands.
Transition metal dichalcogenides, in particular, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),
are potential candidates to extend the studies on moir'e electronics beyond
graphene. Our transport spectroscopy measurements and analysis reveal a
correlation-driven phase transition and the emergence of discrete mini-bands in
MoS2 moir'e superlattices that remained elusive so far. We resolve these
mini-bands arising from quantum mechanical tunneling through Schottky barriers
between the MoS2 and its metallic leads. Energy scales deduced from a first
approach exhibit an astounding agreement with our experimental observations.
The behavior under thermal activation suggests a Lifshitz phase transition at
low temperatures that is driven by a complete spin-valley symmetry breaking.
These intriguing observations bring out the potential of twisted MoS2 to
explore correlated electron states and associated physics.

<h3>Structural regulation of mechanical gating in molecular junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03317" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03317</a>
<br>
<i>Biswajit Pabi, Jakub ≈†ebesta, Richard Koryt√°r, Oren Tal, Atindra Nath Pal</i>
<br>
<br>
In contrast to silicon-based transistors, single molecule junctions can be
gated by simple mechanical means. Specifically, charge can be transferred
between the junction's electrodes and its molecular bridge when the
interelectrode distance is modified, leading to variations in the electronic
transport properties of the junction. While this effect has been studied
extensively, the influence of the molecule orientation on mechanical gating has
not been addressed, despite its potential influence on the gating
effectiveness. Here, we show that the same molecular junction can experience
either clear mechanical gating or none, depending on the molecule orientation
in the junctions. The effect is found in silver-ferrocene-silver break
junctions, and analyzed in view of ab-initio and transport calculations, where
the influence of molecular orbitals geometry on charge transfer to or from the
molecule is revealed. The molecule orientation is thus a new degree of freedom
that can be used to optimize mechanically-gated molecular junctions.

<h3>Rotational dynamics induced by low energy binary collisions of quantum  droplets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03379</a>
<br>
<i>J. E. Alba-Arroyo, S. F. Caballero-Benitez, R. Jauregui</i>
<br>
<br>
A theoretical analysis of the rotational dynamics induced by off axis binary
collisions of quantum droplets constituted by ultracold atoms is reported. We
focus on quantum droplets formed by degenerate dilute Bose gases made up from
binary mixtures of alkaline atoms under feasible experimental conditions. The
stability of the ground state is known to be longer for the chosen
heteronuclear gases than for the homonuclear ones. In both cases, we find out
that the dynamics seems to privilege a high similarity of the density of each
atomic species. However, the evolution of the phase of the corresponding order
parameter differs significantly for heteronuclear admixtures. We evaluate the
fidelity as a figure of merit for the overlap between the order parameters of
each atomic species. Dynamical evidence of the differences between the phase of
the order parameters are predicted to manifest in their corresponding linear
and angular momenta. We numerically verify that the total angular and linear
momenta are conserved both during the collision. Some direct correlations
between the Weber number and the impact parameter with the distribution of the
dynamical variables are established.

Iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ possess unique electronic
properties such as non-magnetic nematic order and its quantum critical point.
The nature of superconductivity with such nematicity is important for
understanding the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. A recent
theory suggested the possible emergence of a fundamentally new class of
superconductivity with the so-called Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in this
system. However, such an {\em ultranodal} pair state requires broken
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in the superconducting state, which has not been
observed experimentally. Here we report muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR)
measurements in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ superconductors for $0\le x \le 0.22$
covering both orthorhombic (nematic) and tetragonal phases. We find that the
zero-field muon relaxation rate is enhanced below the superconducting
transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ for all compositions, indicating that the
superconducting state breaks TRS both in the nematic and tetragonal phases.
Moreover, the transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal that the superfluid
density shows an unexpected and substantial reduction in the tetragonal phase
($x>0.17$). This implies that a significant fraction of electrons remain
unpaired in the zero-temperature limit, which cannot be explained by the known
unconventional superconducting states with point or line nodes. The
time-reversal symmetry breaking and the suppressed superfluid density in the
tetragonal phase, together with the reported enhanced zero-energy excitations,
are consistent with the ultranodal pair state with BFSs. The present results
reveal two different superconducting states with broken TRS separated by the
nematic critical point in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, which calls for the theory of
microscopic origins that account for the relation between the nematicity and
superconductivity.

<h3>Mobile Kink Solitons in a Van der Waals Charge-Density-Wave Layer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03413</a>
<br>
<i>Jinwon Lee, Jae Whan Park, Gil-Young Cho, Han Woong Yeom</i>
<br>
<br>
Kinks, point-like geometrical defects along dislocations, domain walls, and
DNA, are stable and mobile, as solutions of a sine-Gordon wave equation. While
they are widely investigated for crystal deformations and domain wall motions,
electronic properties of individual kinks have received little attention. In
this work, electronically and topologically distinct kinks are discovered along
electronic domain walls in a correlated van der Waals insulator of
1$T$-TaS$_2$. Mobile kinks and antikinks are identified as trapped by pinning
defects and imaged in scanning tunneling microscopy. Their atomic structures
and in-gap electronic states are unveiled, which are mapped approximately into
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger solitons. The twelve-fold degeneracy of the domain walls
in the present system guarantees an extraordinarily large number of distinct
kinks and antikinks to emerge. Such large degeneracy together with the robust
geometrical nature may be useful for handling multilevel information in van der
Waals materials architectures.

<h3>Minimal tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling for the ZrSiSe  nodal line Dirac semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03438" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03438</a>
<br>
<i>Gustavo S. Orozco-Galvan, Salvador Barraza-Lopez</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin orbit coupling (SOC) breaks energy degeneracies and produces an energy
gap on the linear band crossings of ZrSiSe around the Fermi energy. Klemenz
\textit{et al.} [{\em Phys. Rev. B} {\bf 101}, 165121 (2020)] suggested that
the relevant energy dispersion of this class of materials is two-dimensional,
and that it can be obtained by recourse to silicon orbitals only. Crucially,
the relevant energy-degenerate crossings are created by a band-folding
procedure in that model. Given that band folding is only {\em a choice} for
displaying an electronic structure, it does not affect the charge carrier's
dynamics {\em per se}. We first show that SOC does not induce a band gap on the
zero-energy crossings of that model: such gaps appear elsewhere in the first
Brillouin zone. We then develop a minimal, qualitative tight binding model for
ZrSiSe that has the proper SOC-induced gap openings and electron symmetries.
The model relies on the density-functional-theory (DFT) electronic dispersion
obtained with a tool in which electronic states are written in terms of
localized atomic orbitals [{\em J. Phys.: Condens. Matter} {\bf 14}, 2745
(2002)]: we remove orbitals gradually, and perform calculations with SOC turned
on, to arrive at a minimal set of parameters that include silicon and zirconium
atomic orbitals. We are able to determine that the electronic bands due to
silicon in previous model lie above the Fermi energy. Our tight binding model
with SOC is shown to describe ZrSiSe slabs as well.

<h3>Automated characterization of spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in  supercooled liquids via implementation of Machine Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03469" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03469</a>
<br>
<i>Viet Nguyen, Xueyu Song</i>
<br>
<br>
A computational approach by an implementation of the Principle Component
Analysis (PCA) with K-means and Gaussian Mixture (GM) clustering methods from
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify structural and dynamical
heterogeneities of supercooled liquids is developed. In this method, a
collection of the average weighted coordination numbers ($\overline{WCNs}$) of
particles calculated from particles' positions are used as an order parameter
to build a low-dimensional representation of feature (structural) space for
K-means clustering to sort the particles in the system into few meso-states
using PCA. Nano-domains or aggregated clusters are also formed in
configurational (real) space from a direct mapping using associated
meso-states' particle identities with some misclassified interfacial particles.
These classification uncertainties can be improved by a co-learning strategy
which utilizes the probabilistic GM clustering and the information transfer
between the structural space and configurational space iteratively until
convergence. A final classification of meso-states in structural space and
domains in configurational space are stable over long times and measured to
have dynamical heterogeneities. Armed with such a classification protocol,
various studies over the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of these
domains indicate that the observed heterogeneity is the result of liquid-liquid
phase separation after quenching to a supercooled state.

<h3>Surface enhanced covalency and Madelung potentials in Nb doped SrTiO$_3$  (100), (110) and (111) single crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03480</a>
<br>
<i>G.M. Vanacore, L.F. Zagonel, N. Barrett</i>
<br>
<br>
The influence of surface enhanced covalency on the Madelung potential is
experimentally investigated using angle-resolved photoemission for (100), (110)
and (111) SrTiO$_3$ surfaces after annealing in UHV at 630 {\deg}C.
Deconvolution of the core level spectra (O 1s, Sr 3d and Ti 2p) distinguishes
bulk and surface components, which are interpreted in terms of surface enhanced
covalency (SEC). By comparing the experimentally measured binding energies with
theoretical calculations developed in the framework of the Localized-Hole
Point-Ion Model, we quantitatively determine the effective electron occupancy
at bulk and surface Sr and Ti sites. Our results confirm the essentially ionic
character of Sr$-$O bond and the partially covalent character of Ti$-$O bond in
bulk STO. The cation Ti and Sr electron occupation is greater for all the three
surfaces than in the bulk. Surface covalency shifts the Madelung potential at
the surface by {\Delta}EM. {\Delta}EM is a minimum for the (111) surface, and
increases through (100), attaining a maximum for (110). The angle-resolved
valence band spectra and the work function values also confirm this trend. The
results are consistent with d$-$d charge fluctuations dominating at the
surface, whereas metal-ligand charge transfers are more energetically
favourable in the bulk.

<h3>Mending Cracks in Rutile TiO$_{2}$ with Electron Beam</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03482" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03482</a>
<br>
<i>Silu Guo, Hwanhui Yun, Sreejith Nair, Bharat Jalan, K. Andre Mkhoyan</i>
<br>
<br>
Restructuring of rutile TiO$_{2}$ under electron beam irradiation driven by
radiolysis was observed and analyzed using a combination of atomic-resolution
imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM). It was determined that a high-energy (80-300 keV)
electron beam at high doses ($\gtrapprox 10^7 \ e/nm^2$) can constructively
restructure rutile TiO$_{2}$ with an efficiency of $6\times 10^{-6}$. These
observations were realized using rutile TiO$_{2}$ samples with atomically sharp
nanometer-wide cracks. Based on atomic-resolution STEM imaging and quantitative
EELS analysis, we propose a $"$ 2-step $"$ rolling model of the octahedral
building blocks of the crystal to account for observed radiolysis-driven atomic
migration.

<h3>Nonlinear response of the Kitaev honeycomb lattice model in a weak  magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03521" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03521</a>
<br>
<i>M. Kazem Negahdari, Abdollah Langari</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the nonlinear response of the Kitaev honeycomb lattice model
in a weak magnetic field using the theory of two-dimensional coherent
spectroscopy. We observe that at the isotropic point in the non-Abelian phase
of this model, the nonlinear spectrum in the 2D frequency domain consists of
sharp signals that originate from the flux excitations and Majorana bound
states. Signatures of different flux excitations can be clearly observed in
this spectrum, such that one can observe evidences of flux states with
4-adjacent, 2-non-adjacent, and 4-far-separated fluxes, which are not visible
in linear response spectroscopy such as neutron scattering experiments.
Moreover, in the Abelian phase we perceive that the spectrum in the frequency
domain is composed of streak signals. These signals, as in the nonlinear
response of the pure Kitaev model, represent a distinct signature of itinerant
Majorana fermions. However, deep in the Abelian phase whenever a Kitaev
exchange coupling is much stronger than the others, the streak signals are
weakened and only single sharp spots are seen in the response, which resembles
the dispersionless response of the conventional toric code.

<h3>Wiener-Hopf factorization approach to a bulk-boundary correspondence and  stability conditions for topological zero-energy modes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03524" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03524</a>
<br>
<i>Abhijeet Alase, Emilio Cobanera, Gerardo Ortiz, Lorenza Viola</i>
<br>
<br>
Both the physics and applications of fermionic symmetry-protected topological
phases rely heavily on a principle known as bulk-boundary correspondence, which
predicts the emergence of protected boundary-localized energy excitations
(boundary states) if the bulk is topologically non-trivial. Current theoretical
approaches formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence as an equality between a
bulk and a boundary topological invariant, where the latter is a property of
boundary states. However, such an equality does not offer insight about the
stability or the sensitivity of the boundary states to external perturbations.
To solve this problem, we adopt a technique known as the Wiener-Hopf
factorization of matrix functions. Using this technique, we first provide an
elementary proof of the equality of the bulk and the boundary invariants for
one-dimensional systems with arbitrary boundary conditions in all
Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. This equality also applies to
quasi-one-dimensional systems (e.g., junctions) formed by bulks belonging to
the same symmetry class. We then show that only topologically non-trivial
Hamiltonians can host stable zero-energy edge modes, where stability refers to
continuous deformation of zero-energy excitations with external perturbations
that preserve the symmetries of the class. By leveraging the Wiener-Hopf
factorization, we establish bounds on the sensitivity of such stable
zero-energy modes to external perturbations. Our results show that the
Wiener-Hopf factorization is a natural tool to investigate bulk-boundary
correspondence in quasi-one-dimensional fermionic symmetry-protected
topological phases. Our results on the stability and sensitivity of zero modes
are especially valuable for applications, including Majorana-based topological
quantum computing.

<br>
<br>
We have developed a novel in situ methodology for the direct study of mass
transport properties in oxides with spatial and unprecedented time resolution,
based on Raman spectroscopy coupled to isothermal isotope exchanges. Changes in
the isotope concentration, resulting in a Raman frequency shift, can be
followed in real time, not accessible by conventional methods, enabling
complementary insights for the study of ion transport properties of electrode
and electrolyte materials for advanced solid-state electrochemical devices. The
proof of concept and strengths of isotope exchange Raman spectroscopy (IERS)
are demonstrated by studying the oxygen isotope back-exchange in
gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO) thin films. Resulting oxygen self-diffusion and
surface exchange coefficients are compared to conventional time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) characterisation and literature
values, showing good agreement, while at the same time providing additional
insight, challenging established assumptions. IERS captivates through its
rapidity, simple setup, non-destructive nature, cost effectiveness and
versatile fields of application and thus can readily be integrated as new
standard tool for in situ and operando characterization in many laboratories
worldwide. The applicability of this method is expected to consolidate our
understanding of elementary physicochemical processes and impact various
emerging fields including solid oxide cells, battery research and beyond.

<h3>Microscopic singularity of an entropic force in stochastic order  parameter dynamics</h3>

The steady propagation of a $(d-1)$-dimensional planer interface in
$d$-dimensional space is studied by analyzing mesoscopic order-parameter
dynamics with two local minima under the influence thermal noise. In this
analysis, an entropic force generating interface propagation is formulated
using a perturbation method. It is found that the entropic force singularly
depends on an ultraviolet cut-off when $d \ge 2$. The theoretical calculation
is confirmed by numerical simulations with $d=2$. The result means that an
experimental measurement of the entropic force provides an estimation of the
microscopic cut-off of the mesoscopic description.

The role of interlayer bonds in the two-dimensional (2D) materials "beyond
graphene" and so-called van der Waals heterostructures is vital, and
understanding the nature of these bonds in terms of strength and type is
essential due to a wide range of their prospective technological applications.
However, this issue has not yet been properly addressed in the previous
investigations devoted to 2D materials. In our work, by using first-principles
calculations we perform a systematic study of the interlayer bonds and charge
redistribution of several representative 2D materials that are traditionally
referred as van der Waals systems. Our results demonstrate that one can
distinguish three main types of inter-layer couplings in the considered 2D
structures: one atom thick membranes bonded by London dispersion forces
(graphene, hBN), systems with leading electrostatic interaction between layers
(diselenides, InSe and bilayer silica) and materials with so-called dative or
coordination chemical bonds between layers (ditelurides). We also propose a
protocol for recognising the leading type of interlayer bonds in a system that
includes comparison of interlayer distances, binding energies and
redistribution of the charge densities in interlayer space. Such an approach is
computationally cheap and can be used to further prediction of chemical and
physical properties such as charge density waves (CDW), work function and
chemical stability at ambient conditions.

The application of a temperature gradient to an extended system generates an
electromotive force that induces an electric current in conductors and a
macroscopic polarization in insulators. The ratio of the electromotive force to
the temperature difference, usually referred to as the Seebeck coefficient, is
often computed using non-equilibrium techniques, such as non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics (NEMD). In this paper we argue that thermo-polarization
effects in insulating fluids can be conveniently treated by standard
equilibrium thermodynamics and devise a protocol, based on a combination of
equilibrium molecular dynamics and Bayesian inference methods, that allows one
to compute the Seebeck coefficient in these systems along with a rigorous
estimate of the resulting statistical accuracy. The application of our
methodology to liquid SPC/E water results in good agreement with previous
studies, based on more elaborate NEMD simulations, and in a more reliable
estimate of the statistical accuracy of the results.

The d-wave symmetry of the order parameter with zero energy gap in nodal
directions stands in the way of using high-temperature superconductors for
quantum applications. We investigate the symmetry of the order parameter in
ultra-thin YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) films by measuring the electrical transport
properties of nanowires and nanoconstrictions aligned at different angles
relative to the main crystallographic axes. The anisotropy of the nanowire
critical current in the nodal and antinodal directions reduces with the
decrease in the film thickness. The Andreev reflection spectroscopy shows the
presence of a thickness-dependent energy gap that doesn't exist in bulk YBCO.
We find that the thickness-dependent energy gap appears due to the quantum size
effects in ultra-thin YBCO films that open the superconducting energy gap along
the entire Fermi surface. The fully gapped state of the ultra-thin YBCO films
makes them a very promising platform for quantum applications, including
quantum computing and quantum communications.

The fine structure of attractive Fermi polarons in van der Waals
heterostructures based on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the
presence of elastic strain is studied theoretically. The charged excitons
(trions), three particle bound states of two electrons and hole or two holes
and electron, do not show any strain-induced fine structure splitting compared
to neutral excitons whose radiative doublet is split by the strain into
linearly polarized components. The correlation of the trions with Fermi sea
holes gives rise to the attractive Fermi polarons. We show that it results in
the fine structure splitting of the polaron into states polarized along the
main axes of the strain tensor. The effect is related to the bosonic statistics
of Fermi polarons. We develop microscopic theory of the effect and calculate
the strain-induced splitting of Fermi polarons both for tungsten- and
molybdenum-based monolayers identifying the role of inter- and intravalley
exciton-electron interactions. The fine structure splitting of attractive Fermi
polaron is proportional both to excitonic splitting and the Fermi energy. The
Fermi polaron fine structure in bilayers is briefly analyzed and the role of
electron and trion localization in moire potentials is discussed.

<h3>Absence of electron-phonon-mediated superconductivity in  hydrogen-intercalated nickelates</h3>

<br>
<br>
A recent experiment [X. Ding et al., Nature 615, 50 (2023)] indicates that
superconductivity in nickelates is restricted to a narrow window of hydrogen
concentration: 0.22 < x < 0.28 in Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$H$_{x}$. This
reported necessity of hydrogen suggests that it plays a crucial role for
superconductivity, as it does in the vast field of hydride superconductors.
Using density-functional theory and its extensions, we explore the effect of
topotactic hydrogen on the electronic structure and phonon-mediated
superconductivity in nickelate superconductors. Our calculations show that the
electron-phonon coupling in hydrogen-intercalated nickelates is not strong
enough to drive the electron pairing, and thus cannot explain the reported
superconductivity.

<h3>Thermally driven elastic membranes are quasi-linear across all scales</h3>

We study the static and dynamic structure of thermally fluctuating elastic
thin sheets by investigating the overdamped dynamic F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an
equation, in which the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an equation from elasticity theory
is driven by white noise. This nonlinear equation is governed by a single
nondimensional coupling parameter $g$ whose large and small values correspond
to weak and strong nonlinear coupling respectively. By analysing the weak
coupling case with ordinary perturbation theory and the strong coupling case
with a self-consistent methodology known as the self-consistent expansion,
precise analytic predictions for the static and dynamic structure factors are
obtained. The maximum frequency $n_{\max}$ supported by the system plays a role
in determining which of three possible classes such sheets belong to: (1) when
$g\gg1$, the system is mostly linear with roughness exponent $\zeta=1$ and
dynamic exponent $z=4$, (2) when $g\ll2/n_{\max}$, the system is extremely
nonlinear with roughness exponent $\zeta=1/2$ and dynamic exponent $z=3$, (3)
between these regimes, an intermediate behaviour is obtained in which a
crossover occurs such that the nonlinear behaviour is observed for small
frequencies while the linear behaviour is observed for large frequencies. The
large frequency linear tail is found to have a significant impact on the small
frequency behaviour of the sheet. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest
that ultra-thin materials such as graphene lie in this intermediate regime.
Despite the existence of these three distinct behaviours, the decay rate of the
dynamic structure factor is related to the static structure factor as if the
system were completely linear. This quasi-linearity occurs regardless of the
size of $g$ and at all length scales. Numerical simulations confirm the
existence of the three classes of behaviour and the quasi-linearity of all
classes.

<h3>Extracting quantum-geometric effects from Ginzburg-Landau theory in a  multiband Hubbard model</h3>

<br>
<br>
We first apply functional-integral approach to a multiband Hubbard model near
the critical pairing temperature, and derive a generic effective action that is
quartic in the fluctuations of the pairing order parameter. Then we consider
time-reversal-symmetric systems with uniform (i.e., at both low-momentum and
low-frequency) pairing fluctuations in a unit cell, and derive the
corresponding time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation. In addition to
the conventional intraband contribution that depends on the derivatives of the
Bloch bands, we show that the kinetic coefficients of the TDGL equation have a
geometric contribution that is controlled by both the quantum-metric tensor of
the underlying Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors.
Furthermore we show that thermodynamic properties such as London penetration
depth, GL coherence length, GL parameter and upper critical magnetic field have
an explicit dependence on quantum geometry.

<br>
<br>
We investigate active spatial control of polariton condensates independently
of the polariton-, gain-inducing excitation profile. This is achieved by
introducing an extra intracavity semiconductor layer, non-resonant to the
cavity mode. Saturation of the optical absorption in the uncoupled layer
enables the ultra-fast modulation of the effective refractive index and,
through excited-state absorption, the polariton dissipation. Utilising these
mechanisms, we demonstrate control over the spatial profile and density of a
polariton condensate at room temperature.

<h3>Electron confinement in chain-doped TMDs: A platform for spin-orbit  coupled 1D physics</h3>

<i>Mayank Gupta, Amit Chauhan, S. Satpathy, B. R. K. Nanda</i>
<br>
<br>
The state-of-the-art defect engineering techniques have paved the way to
realize novel quantum phases out of pristine materials. Here, through
density-functional calculations and model studies, we show that the chain-doped
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), where M atoms on a single
the zigzag chains are replaced by a higher-valence transition-metal element
M$^\prime$ (MX$_2$/M$^\prime$), exhibit one-dimensional (1D) bands. These 1D
bands, occurring in the fundamental gap of the pristine material, are
dispersive along the doped chain but are strongly confined along the lateral
direction. This confinement occurs as the bare potential of the dopant chain
formed by the positively charged M$^\prime$ ions resembles the potential well
of a uniformly charged wire. These bands could show novel 1D physics, including
a new type of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, multi-orbital Mott insulator
physics, and an unusual optical absorption, due to the simultaneous presence of
the spin-orbit coupling, strong correlation, multiple orbitals, Rashba spin
splitting, and broken symmetry. For the half-filled 1D bands, we find, quite
surprisingly, a broadening of the 1D bands due to correlation, as opposed to
the expected band narrowing. This is interpreted to be due to multiple orbitals
forming the single Hubbard band at different points of the Brillouin zone.
Furthermore, due to the presence of an intrinsic electric field along the
lateral direction, the 1D bands are Rashba spin-split and provide a new
mechanism for tuning the valley dependent optical transitions.

<h3>Noise-induced quenched disorder in dense active systems</h3>

<br>

We report and characterize the emergence of a noise-induced state of quenched
disorder in a generic model describing a dense sheet of active polar disks with
non-isotropic rotational and translational dynamics. In this state, randomly
oriented self-propelled disks become jammed, only displaying small fluctuations
about their mean positions and headings. The quenched disorder phase appears at
intermediate noise levels, between the two states that typically define the
flocking transition (a standard disordered state that displays continuously
changing headings due to rotational diffusion and a polar order state of
collective motion). We find that the angular fluctuations in this dense system
follow an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process leading to retrograde forces that oppose
self-propulsion, and determine its properties. Using this result, we explain
the mechanism behind the emergence of the quenched state and compute
analytically its critical noise, showing that it matches our numerical
simulations. We argue that this novel type of state could be observed in a
broad range of natural and artificial dense active systems with repulsive
interactions.

<h3>Humidity-induced glass transition of a polyelectrolyte brush creates  switchable friction in air</h3>

<br>

Polymer brushes have found extensive applications as responsive surfaces,
particularly in achieving tunable friction in solvent environments. Despite
recent interest in extending this technology to air environments, little is
known about the impact of vapor absorption on friction. Considering
polyelectrolyte brushes, we report findings that reveal, with increasing
relative humidity, a trend of frictional shear forces decaying over two orders
of magnitude only after achieving a critical humidity. However, water
absorption, structure, and swelling of the brushes followed continuous trends
with increasing humidity. In contrast, a humidity-induced glass transition
occurred which caused a shift from dry to fluid-like sliding with the
water-swollen brush acting as the lubricant. Below the glass transition,
friction is large without regard to water concentration; thus, friction
transitions sharply. This switching mechanism, shown to be a general property
of the hygroscopic polymer, provides new opportunities for switchable friction
or other surface actuation from vapor stimuli.

<h3>The boson peak in the vibrational spectra of glasses</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
A hallmark of glasses is an excess of low-frequency, nonphononic vibrations,
in addition to phonons. It is associated with the intrinsically nonequilibrium
and disordered nature of glasses, and is generically manifested as a THz peak
-- the boson peak -- in the ratio of the vibrational density of state (VDoS)
and Debye's VDoS of phonons. Yet, the excess vibrations and the boson peak are
not fully understood. Here, using reanalysis of experimental data, extensive
computer simulations and a mean-field model, we show that the nonphononic part
of the VDoS itself features both a universal power-law tail and a peak,
entirely accounted for by quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations, whose
existence was recently established. We explain the mild variation of the peak's
frequency and magnitude with glasses' thermal history, along with the strong
variation of the power-law tail. We also show that modes that populate the
peak's region feature many coupled quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations, when
their spatial structure is considered. Our results provide a unified physical
picture of the low-frequency vibrational spectra of glasses, and in particular
elucidate the origin, nature and properties of the boson peak.

<h3>The Largest Fullerene</h3>

<br>
<i>Michael Gatchell, Henning Zettergren, Klavs Hansen</i>
<br>
<br>
Fullerenes are lowest energy structures for gas phase all-carbon particles
for a range of sizes, but graphite remains the lowest energy allotrope of bulk
carbon. This implies that the lowest energy structure changes nature from
fullerenes to graphite or graphene at some size and therefore, in turn, implies
a limit on the size of free fullerenes as ground state structures. We calculate
this largest stable single shell fullerene to be of size $N=1\times10^4$, using
the AIREBO effective potential. Above this size fullerene onions are more
stable, with an energy per atom that approaches graphite structures. Onions and
graphite have very similar ground state energies, raising the intriguing
possibility that fullerene onions could be the lowest free energy states of
large carbon particles in some temperature range.

Vertical heterostructures (HS) of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
host interlayer excitons (ILX), with electrons and holes residing in different
layers. With respect to their intralayer counterparts, ILX feature much longer
lifetimes and diffusion lengths, paving the way to excitonic optoelectronic
devices operating at room temperature. While the recombination dynamics of ILX
has been intensively studied, the formation process and its underlying physical
mechanisms are still largely unexplored. Here we use ultrafast transient
absorption spectroscopy with a white-light probe, spanning both intralayer and
interlayer exciton resonances, to simultaneously capture and time-resolve
interlayer charge transfer and ILX formation dynamics in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS.
We find that the ILX formation timescale is nearly an order of magnitude (~1
ps) longer than the interlayer charge transfer time (~100 fs). Microscopic
calculations attribute the relative delay to an interplay between a
phonon-assisted interlayer exciton cascade and subsequent cooling processes,
and excitonic wave-function overlap. Our results provide an explanation to the
efficient photocurrent generation observed in optoelectronic devices based on
TMD HS, as the ILX have an opportunity to dissociate during their
thermalization process.

The high degree of control on ultracold gases allows us to precisely
manipulate their internal state. When the gas is made of atoms in two different
internal states, it can be considered as a two-component spin mixture. Below a
critical temperature, the gas becomes a superfluid mixture, never realized
before with any other platform, and therefore interesting to study per se, but
it also constitutes a promising and versatile platform for applications in
spintronic devices or to study phenomena belonging to very different fields,
such as magnetism, high-energy physics or gravitation. Here, I will revisit
ground-state properties and excitations of a binary bosonic superfluid, and
then introduce a coherent coupling between the states and treat the global
state of the atoms as a spin in the presence of a variable external field.

Operating Si quantum dot (QD) arrays requires homogeneous and ultra-dense
structures with aggressive gate pitch. Such a density is necessary to
separately control the QDs chemical potential (i.e. charge occupation of each
QD) from the exchange interaction (i.e. tunnel barriers between each QD). We
present here a novel Si quantum device integration that halves the effective
gate pitch and provides full controllability in 1D FDSOI QD arrays. The major
advantages of this architecture are explored through numerical simulations.
Functionality of the fabricated structure is validated via 300K statistical
electrical characterization, while tunnel-coupling control is demonstrated at
cryogenic temperature.

Al-Si alloys processed by laser rapid solidification yield eutectic
microstructures with ultrafine and interconnected fibers. Such fibrous
structures have long been thought to bear resemblance to those formed in
impurity-doped alloys upon conventional casting. Here, we show that any
similarity is purely superficial. By harnessing high-throughput
characterization and computer vision techniques, we perform a three-dimensional
analysis of the branching behavior of the ultrafine eutectic and compare it
against an impurity-modified eutectic as well as a random fractal (as a
benchmark). Differences in the branching statistics point to different
microstructural origins of the impurity- and quench-modified eutectic. Our
quantitative approach is not limited to the data presented here but can be used
to extract abstract information from other volumetric datasets, without
customization.

Non-Hermitian band theory distinguishes between line gaps and point gaps.
While point gaps can give rise to intrinsic non-Hermitian band topology without
Hermitian counterparts, line-gapped systems can always be adiabatically
deformed to a Hermitian or anti-Hermitian limit. Here we show that line-gap
topology and point-gap topology are intricately connected: topological
line-gapped systems in $d$ dimensions generically induce nontrivial point-gap
topology on their $(d-1)$-dimensional boundaries. We explain how this
phenomenon can be guaranteed by enforcing suitable internal and spatial
symmetries. The non-Hermitian boundary topology further leads to higher-order
skin modes, as well as chiral and helical hinge modes, that are protected by
point gaps and hence unique to non-Hermitian systems. We identify all the
symmetry classes where bulk line-gap topology induces boundary point-gap
topology and establish the correspondence between their topological invariants.
There also exist some symmetry classes where the Hermitian edge states remain
stable, in the sense that even a point gap cannot open on the boundary.
