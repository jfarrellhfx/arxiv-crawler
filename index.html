<h3>Many-Body Quantum Geometric Effects on Trapped Ultracold Bosons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14004</a>
<br>
<i>Yeyang Zhang</i>
<p>Quantum geometric effects in uncorrelated systems are characterized by the
Berry curvature and quantum metric. Beyond those, we propose three
gauge-independent tensors describing quantum geometric effects on local
interaction between correlated particles. We derive an effective hydrodynamic
theory for ultracold bosons in optical lattices. Ground states and collective
modes of superfluids in isotropic harmonic traps are solved for highly
symmetric lattices. In a dynamic process, the amplitude and phase shift of an
excited breathing mode are determined by the geometric properties of Bloch
wavefunctions. We also give a tight-binding model of a bipartite square lattice
with nontrivial quantum geometric effects. Our discovery advances the
connections between the modern band theory and quantum many-body physics.

<h3>Electrotaxis of self-propelling artificial swimmers in microchannels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14376" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14376</a>
<br>
<i>Carola M. Buness, Avi Rana, Corinna C. Maass, Ranabir Dey</i>
<p>Ciliated microswimmers and flagellated bacteria alter their swimming
trajectories to follow the direction of an applied electric field exhibiting
electrotaxis. Both for matters of application and physical modelling, it is
instructive to study such behaviour in synthetic swimmers. We show here that
under an external electric field, self-propelling active droplets autonomously
modify their swimming trajectories in microchannels, even undergoing `U-turns',
to exhibit robust electrotaxis. Depending on the relative initial orientations
of the microswimmer and the external electric field, the active droplet can
also navigate upstream of an external flow following a centre-line motion,
instead of the oscillatory upstream trajectory observed in absence of electric
field. Using a hydrodynamic theory model, we show that the electrically induced
angular velocity and electrophoretic effects, along with the microswimmer
motility and its hydrodynamic interactions with the microchannel walls, play
crucial roles in dictating the electrotactic trajectories and dynamics.
Specifically, the transformation in the trajectories during upstream swimming
against an external flow under an electric field can be understood as a reverse
Hopf bifurcation for a dynamical system. Our study provides a simple
methodology and a systematic understanding of manoeuvring active droplets in
microconfinements for micro-robotic applications especially in biotechnology.

<h3>Topological fingerprints in Liouvillian gaps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13732" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13732</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin Kavanagh, Joost K. Slingerland, Shane Dooley, Graham Kells</i>
<p>Topology in many-body physics usually emerges as a feature of equilibrium
quantum states. We show that topological fingerprints can also appear in the
relaxation rates of open quantum systems. To demonstrate this we consider one
of the simplest models that has two distinct topological phases in its ground
state: the Kitaev model for the $p$-wave superconductor. After introducing
dissipation to this model we estimate the Liouvillian gap in both strong and
weak dissipative limits. Our results show that a non-zero superconducting
pairing opens a Liouvillian gap that remains open in the limit of infinite
system size. At strong dissipation this gap is essentially unaffected by the
topology of the underlying Hamiltonian ground state. In contrast, when
dissipation is weak, the topological phase of the Hamiltonian ground state
plays a crucial role in determining the character of the Liouvillian gap. We
find, for example, that in the topological phase this gap is completely immune
to changes in the chemical potential. On the other hand, in the non-topological
phase the Liouvillian gap is suppressed by a large chemical potential.

<h3>Local structural features elucidate crystallization of complex  structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13765" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13765</a>
<br>
<i>Maya M. Martirossyan, Matthew Spellings, Hillary Pan, Julia Dshemuchadse</i>
<p>Complex crystal structures are composed of multiple local environments, and
how this type of order emerges spontaneously during crystal growth has yet to
be fully understood. We study crystal growth across various structures and
along different crystallization pathways, using self-assembly simulations of
identical particles that interact via multi-well isotropic pair potentials. We
apply an unsupervised machine learning method to features from
bond-orientational order metrics to identify different local motifs present
during a given structure's crystallization process. In this manner, we
distinguish different crystallographic sites in highly complex structures.
Tailoring this newly developed order parameter to structures of varying
complexity and coordination number, we study the emergence of local order along
a multi-step crystal growth pathway -- from a low-density fluid to a
high-density, supercooled amorphous liquid droplet and to a bulk crystal. We
find a consistent under-coordination of the liquid relative to the average
coordination number in the bulk crystal. We use our order parameter to analyze
the geometrically frustrated growth of a Frank--Kasper phase and discover how
structural defects compete with the formation of crystallographic sites that
are higher-coordinated than the liquid environments. The here-presented method
for classifying order on a particle-by-particle level have broad applicability
to future studies of structural self-assembly and crystal growth, and they can
aid in the design of building blocks and for targeting pathways of formation of
novel soft-matter structures.

<h3>The Emergence of Antiferromagnetic Correlations and Kondo-like Features  in a Two-Band Model for Infinite-Layer Nickelates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13767</a>
<br>
<i>Fangze Liu, Cheng Peng, Edwin W. Huang, Brian Moritz, Chunjing Jia, Thomas P. Devereaux</i>
<p>We report a determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of a two-band model,
inspired by infinite-layer nickelates, focusing on the influence of interlayer
hybridization between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals derived from Ni (or Ni and O) in
one layer and rare-earth ($R$) 5d orbitals in the other layer, hereafter the NI
and $R$ layers, respectively. For a filling with one electron shared between
the two layers on average, interlayer hybridization leads to "self-doped" holes
in the Ni layer and the absence of antiferromagnetic ordering, but rather the
appearance of spin-density and charge-density stripe-like states. As the
interlayer hybridization increases, both the Ni and $R$ layers develop
antiferromagnetic correlations, even though either layer individually remains
away from half-filling. For hybridization within an intermediate range, roughly
comparable to the intralayer nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{\text{Ni}}$, the
model develops signatures of Kondo-like physics.

<h3>Mesoscale self-organization of polydisperse magnetic nanoparticles at  the water surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13768</a>
<br>
<i>Victor Ukleev, Artoem Khassanov, Irina Snigireva, Oleg Konovalov, Alexei Vorobiev</i>
<p>In this study, we investigated the self-ordering process in Langmuir films of
polydisperse iron oxide nanoparticles on a water surface, employing in-situ
X-ray scattering, surface pressure-area isotherm analysis, and Brewster angle
microscopy. X-ray reflectometry confirmed the formation of a monolayer, while
grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering revealed short-range lateral
correlations with a characteristic length equal to the mean particle size.
Remarkably, our findings indicated that at zero surface pressure, the particles
organized into submicrometer clusters, merging upon compression to form a
homogeneous layer. These layers were subsequently transferred to a solid
substrate using the Langmuir-Schaefer technique and further characterized via
scanning electron microscopy and polarized neutron reflectometry. Notably, our
measurements unveiled a second characteristic length in the lateral
correlations, orders of magnitude longer than the mean particle diameter, with
polydisperse particles forming circular clusters densely packed in a hexagonal
lattice. Furthermore, our evidence suggested that the lattice constant of this
mesocrystal depended on the characteristics of the particle size distribution,
specifically the mean particle size and the width of the size distribution.
Additionally, we observed internal size separation within these clusters, where
larger particles were positioned closer to the center of the cluster. Finally,
polarized neutron reflectometry measurements provided valuable insights into
the magnetization profile across the layer.

<h3>Ribbon operators in the Semidual lattice code model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13774</a>
<br>
<i>Fred Soglohu, Prince K. Osei, Abdulmajid Osumanu</i>
<p>In this work, we provide a rigorous definition of ribbon operators in the
Semidual Kitaev lattice model and study their properties. These operators are
essential for understanding quasi-particle excitations within topologically
ordered systems. We show that the ribbon operators generate quasi-particle
excitations at the ends of the ribbon and reveal themselves as irreducible
representations of the Bicrossproduct quantum group
$M(H)=H^{\text{cop}}\lrbicross H$ or $M(H)^{\text{op}}$ depending on their
chirality or local orientation.

<h3>Effective stick-slip parameter for structurally lubric 2D interface  friction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13780" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13780</a>
<br>
<i>Jin Wang, Andrea Vanossi, Erio Tosatti</i>
<p>The wear-free sliding of layers or flakes of graphene-like 2D materials,
important in many experimental systems, may occur either smoothly or through
stick-slip, depending on driving conditions, corrugation, twist angles, as well
as edges and defects. No single parameter has been so far identified to
discriminate a priori between the two sliding regimes. Such a parameter,
$\eta$, does exist in the ideal (Prandtl-Tomlinson) problem of a point particle
sliding across a 1D periodic lattice potential. In that case $\eta >1$ implies
mechanical instability, generally leading to stick-slip, with $\eta =
\frac{2\pi^2 U_0}{K_\mathrm{p} a^2}$, where $U_0$ is the potential magnitude,
$a$ the lattice spacing, and $K_\mathrm{p}$ the pulling spring constant. Here
we show, supported by a repertoire of graphene flake/graphene sliding
simulations, that a similar stick-slip predictor $\eta_\mathrm{eff}$ can be
defined with the same form but suitably defined $U_\mathrm{eff}$,
$a_\mathrm{eff}$ and $K_\mathrm{eff}$. Remarkably, simulations show that
$a_\mathrm{eff} = a$ of the substrate remains an excellent approximation, while
$K_\mathrm{eff}$ is an effective stiffness parameter, combining equipment and
internal elasticity. Only the effective energy barrier $U_\mathrm{eff}$ needs
to be estimated in order to predict whether stick-slip sliding of a 2D island
or extended layer is expected or not. In a misaligned defect-free circular
graphene sliding island of contact area $A$, we show that $U_\mathrm{eff}$,
whose magnitude for a micrometer size diameter is of order 1 eV, scales as
$A^{1/4}$, thus increasing very gently with size. The PT-like parameter
$\eta_\mathrm{eff}$ is therefore proposed as a valuable tool in 2D layer
sliding.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism in van der Waals (vdW) atomic crystals and
moir\'e superlattices has emerged as a topic of tremendous interest in the
fields of condensed matter physics and materials science within the past
half-decade since its first experimental discovery in 2016 - 2017. It has not
only served as a powerful platform for investigating phase transitions in the
2D limit and exploring new phases of matter, but also provided new
opportunities for applications in microelectronics, spintronics, magnonics,
optomagnetics, and so on. Despite the flourishing developments in 2D magnetism
over this short period of time, further efforts are welcome in multiple
forefronts of 2D magnetism research for achieving the ultimate goal of
routinely implementing 2D magnets as quantum electronic components. In this
review article, we will start with basic concepts and properties of 2D
magnetism, followed by a brief overview of historical efforts in 2D magnetism
research and then a comprehensive review of vdW material-based 2D magnetism. We
will conclude with discussions on potential future research directions for this
growing field of 2D vdW magnetism.

<h3>Heuristic approach to trajectory correlation functions in bounded  regions with Lambert scattering walls</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13797" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13797</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Rao, Robert Golub</i>
<p>The behavior of spins undergoing Lamor precession in the presence of time
varying fields is of interest to many research fields. The frequency shifts and
relaxation resulting from these fields are related to their power spectrum and
can be determined from the Fourier Transform of the auto-correlation functions
of the time varying field. Using the method of images [C. M. Swank, A. K.
Petukhov, and R. Golub, Phys. Lett. A 376, 2319 (2012)] calculated the
position-position auto-correlation function for particles moving in a
rectangular cell with specular scattering walls. In this work we present a
heuristic model that extends this work to the case of Lambert scattering walls.
The results of this model are compared to simulation and show good agreement
from the ballistic to diffusive regime of gas collisions, for both square and
general rectangular cells. This model requires three parameters, two of which
describe the distribution of images in the case of a square cell, and one of
which describes the asymmetry in the mixing of the x and y components of the
velocity in the case of non-square rectangular cells.

<p>Compared to other body-centered cubic (bcc) transition metals Nb has been the
subject of fewer compression studies and there are still aspects of its phase
diagram which are unclear. Here, we report a combined theoretical and
experimental study of Nb under high pressure and temperature. We present the
results of static laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments up to 120 GPa
using synchrotron-based fast x-ray diffraction combined with ab initio quantum
molecular dynamics simulations. The melting curve of Nb is determined, and
evidence for a solid-solid phase transformation in Nb with increasing
temperature is found. The high-temperature phase of Nb is orthorhombic Pnma.
The bcc-Pnma transition is clearly seen in the experimental data on the Nb
principal Hugoniot. The bcc-Pnma coexistence observed in our experiments is
explained. Agreement between the measured and calculated melting curves is very
good except at 40-60 GPa where three experimental points lie below the
theoretical melting curve by 250 K (or 7%); a possible explanation is given.

<h3>Generalized Free Cumulants for Quantum Chaotic Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13829</a>
<br>
<i>Siddharth Jindal, Pavan Hosur</i>
<p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading conjecture for
the emergence of statistical mechanics in generic isolated quantum systems and
is formulated in terms of the matrix elements of operators. An analog known as
the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is
formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we
significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to
study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a
diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates
and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free
probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as
generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we
focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the
Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known
calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently
free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy
previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black
hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a
sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show
that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems
obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that entanglement
velocities, which govern the spreading of entanglement, are encoded in higher
correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates
and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between
them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known
dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.

<h3>Levin-Wen is a gauge theory: entanglement from topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13838" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13838</a>
<br>
<i>Kyle Kawagoe, Corey Jones, Sean Sanford, David Green, David Penneys</i>
<p>We show that the Levin-Wen model of a unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$
is a gauge theory with gauge symmetry given by the tube algebra
$\operatorname{Tube}(\mathcal{C})$. In particular, we define a model
corresponding to a $\operatorname{Tube}(\mathcal{C})$ symmetry protected
topological phase, and we provide a gauging procedure which results in the
corresponding Levin-Wen model. In the case
$\mathcal{C}=\mathsf{Hilb}(G,\omega)$, we show how our procedure reduces to the
twisted gauging of a trivial $G$-SPT to produce the Twisted Quantum Double. We
further provide an example which is outside the bounds of the current
literature, the trivial Fibonacci SPT, whose gauge theory results in the
doubled Fibonacci string-net. Our formalism has a natural topological
interpretation with string diagrams living on a punctured sphere. We provide
diagrams to supplement our mathematical proofs and to give the reader an
intuitive understanding of the subject matter.

<h3>Sliding Dynamics for Bubble Phases on Periodic Modulated Substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13841</a>
<br>
<i>C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt</i>
<p>We analyze a bubble forming system composed of particles with competing long
range repulsive and short range attractive interactions driven over a
quasi-one-dimensional periodic substrate. We find various pinned and sliding
phases as a function of substrate strength and drive amplitude. When the
substrate is weak, a pinned bubble phase appears that depins elastically into a
sliding bubble lattice. For stronger substrates, we find anisotropic bubbles,
disordered bubbles, and stripe phases. Plastic depinning occurs via the hopping
of individual particles from one bubble to the next in a pinned bubble lattice,
and as the drive increases, there is a transition to a state where all of the
bubbles are moving but are continuously shedding and absorbing individual
particles. This is followed at high drives by a moving bubble lattice in which
the particles can no longer escape their individual bubbles. The transition
between the plastic and elastic sliding phases can be detected via signatures
in the velocity-force curves, differential conductivity, and noise. When the
bubbles shrink due to an increase in the attractive interaction term, they fit
better inside the pinning troughs and become more strongly pinned, leading to a
reentrant pinning phase. For weaker attractive terms, the size of the bubbles
becomes greater than the width of the pinning troughs and the depinning becomes
elastic with a reduced depinning threshold.

<h3>Thermal transport and thermoelectric properties of transition metal  dichalcogenides Mo$X_2$ from first-principles calculation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13845" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13845</a>
<br>
<i>Radityo Wisesa, Anugrah Azha, Edi Suprayoga</i>
<p>The properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively
studied and applied in various applications. Our interest is to theoretically
investigate the thermal transport and thermoelectric properties of the 2D
transition metal dichalcogenides Mo$X_2$ ($X$ = S, Se, Te). We employ density
functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory with relaxation-time
approximation to calculate the electronic and transport properties. We also
implemented the kinetic-collective model to improve the calculation of lattice
thermal conductivity. Our calculations indicate that MoTe$_2$ has the highest
ZT of 2.77 among the other Mo$X_2$ at 550 K due to its low thermal conductivity
and high electrical conductivity. Consequently, we suggest that Mo$X_2$
monolayers hold promise as materials for energy conversion devices due to their
relatively high ZT. Moreover, these results could be beneficial to design 2D
material based high performance thermoelectric devices.

<h3>Quantum weight</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13847" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13847</a>
<br>
<i>Yugo Onishi, Liang Fu</i>
<p>We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a fundamental property of
insulating states of matter that is encoded in the ground-state static
structure and measures quantum fluctuation in electrons' center of mass. We
find a sum rule that directly relates quantum weight -- a ground state property
-- with the negative-first moment of the optical conductivity above the gap
frequency. Building on this connection to optical absorption, we derive both an
upper bound and a lower bound on quantum weight in terms of electron density,
dielectric constant, and energy gap. Therefore, quantum weight constitutes a
key material parameter that can be experimentally determined from X-ray
scattering.

<h3>Effect of trivial bands on chiral anomaly-induced longitudinal  magnetoconductivity in Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13855</a>
<br>
<i>Jeonghyeon Suh, Hongki Min</i>
<p>Including the effect of the trivial band near Weyl nodes, we evaluate the
longitudinal magnetoconductivity (LMC) of Weyl semimetals along the magnetic
field direction using the Boltzmann magnetotransport theory, and study its
dependence on the magnetic field, Fermi energy, and temperature. We find that
for weak internode and node-trivial band scatterings, the LMC is quadratic in
the magnetic field and is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the
Fermi energy at high densities due to internode scatterings, and to the square
of the Fermi energy at low densities due to scatterings between a Weyl node and
the trivial band. In the case of strong internode and nodetrivial band
scatterings, the magnetic field-driven anisotropy induced by the phase-space
volume element and the orbital magnetic moment cannot be neglected. As a
result, the LMC exhibits a significantly different trend compared to that in
the weak internode and node-trivial band scattering limit. Finally, we
calculate the temperature dependence of the LMC in the strong inelastic
scattering limit and obtain its asymptotic behaviors at low and high
temperatures, respectively, demonstrating that the temperature dependence is
strongly affected by the existence of the trivial band.

<h3>Topological characterization of the continuum of allosteric response</h3>

<br>
<i>Jason W. Rocks, Eleni Katifori, Andrea J. Liu</i>
<p>Allosteric regulation in proteins is often accompanied by conformational
changes that facilitate transmission of mechanical signals between distant
ligand binding sites. Typically, these deformations are classified in terms of
specific archetypes, including various types of hinge mechanisms or allosteric
pathways localized to sequences of amino acids.However, many allosteric
deformations resist such strict categorization. Here, we introduce a
quantitative topological description of allosteric deformation, unifying all
archetypal mechanisms into a single framework. The topological description
aligns with two key structural features often associated with allosteric
deformations, namely hinge domains and allosteric pathways, enabling us to
quantify the significance of each of these features. To develop the analysis,
we tune computer-generated mechanical networks to perform allostery-like
functions, obtaining an ensemble of networks that establish a range of possible
allosteric deformations. The analysis shows that these networks' allosteric
mechanisms cannot be described in terms of discrete archetypes - they fall on a
continuum. We then apply the same analysis to a collection of allosteric
proteins with similar results, showing that our framework encompasses these
proteins as well as designed allosteric networks. Our results provide a new
picture for allostery, demonstrating not only how it can be described
quantitatively, but also giving insight into how it emerges as a collective
property.

<h3>Lorentzian quantum wells in graphene: the role of shape invariance in  zero-energy states trapping</h3>

<i>Francisco Correa, Luis Inzunza, Vít Jakubský</i>
<p>Confining Dirac fermions in graphene by electrostatic fields is a challenging
task. Electric quantum dots created by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
tip can trap zero-energy quasi-particles. The Lorentzian quantum well provides
a faithful, exactly solvable, approximation to such a potential, hosting
zero-energy bound states for certain values of the coupling constant. We show
that in this critical configuration, the system can be related to the free
particle model by means of a supersymmetric transformation. The revealed shape
invariance of the model greatly simplifies the calculation of the zero modes
and naturally explains the degeneracy of the zero energy.

<h3>Observation of possible excitonic charge density waves and  metal-insulator transitions in atomically thin semimetals</h3>

<i>Qiang Gao, Yang-hao Chan, Pengfei Jiao, Haiyang Chen, Shuaishuai Yin, Kanjanaporn Tangprapha, Yichen Yang, Xiaolong Li, Zhengtai Liu, Dawei Shen, Shengwei Jiang, Peng Chen</i>
<p>Charge density wave (CDW) is a collective quantum phenomenon with a charge
modulation in solids1-2. Condensation of electron and hole pairs with finite
momentum will lead to such an ordered state3-7. However, lattice symmetry
breaking manifested as the softening of phonon modes can occur simultaneously,
which makes it difficult to disentangle the origin of the transition8-14. Here,
we report a condensed phase in low dimensional HfTe2, whereas angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements show a metal-insulator
transition by lowering the temperature in single triatomic layer (TL) HfTe2. A
full gap opening, renormalization of the bands, and emergence of replica bands
at the M point are observed in the low temperatures, indicating formation of a
CDW in the ground state.Raman spectroscopy shows no sign of lattice distortion
within the detection limit. The results are corroborated by first-principles
calculations, demonstrating the electronic origin of the CDW. By adding more
layers, the phase transition is suppressed and completely destroyed at 3 TL
because of the increased screening around the Fermi surface. Interestingly, a
small amount of electron doping in 1 TL film during the growth significantly
raises the transition temperature (TC), which is attributed to a reduced
screening effect and a more balanced electron and hole carrier density. Our
results indicate a CDW formation mechanism consistent with the excitonic
insulator phase in low dimensional HfTe2 and open up opportunity for
realization of novel quantum states based on exciton condensation.

<h3>Ideal Spin-Orbit-Free Dirac Semimetal and Diverse Topological  Transitions in Pr$_8$CoGa$_3$ Family</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13930" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13930</a>
<br>
<i>Manabu Sato, Juba Bouaziz, Shuntaro Sumita, Shingo Kobayashi, Ikuma Tateishi, Stefan Blügel, Akira Furusaki, Motoaki Hirayama</i>
<p>We propose from first-principles calculations that spin-orbit-free materials
in the $RE_8\mathrm{Co}X_3$ group ($RE$ = rare earth elements, $X$ = Al, Ga, or
In) are ideal spinless Dirac semimetals whose Fermi surfaces are fourfold
degenerate band-crossing points (without including spin degeneracy). Despite
the lack of space inversion symmetry in these materials, Dirac points are
formed on the rotation-symmetry axis due to accidental degeneracies of two
bands corresponding to different 2-dimensional irreducible representations of
$C_{6v}$ group. The surface states have two midgap bands emanating from the
projection in the surface Brillouin zone of the bulk Dirac points, in
accordance with nontrivial Zak phases for each glide sector. We also
investigate, through first-principles calculations and effective model
analysis, various phase transitions caused by lattice distortion or elemental
substitutions from the Dirac semimetal phase to distinct topological
semimetallic phases such as nonmagnetic linked-nodal-line and Weyl semimetals
(characterized by the second Stiefel-Whitney class) and ferromagnetic Weyl
semimetals.

<h3>Atomic multiplet and charge-transfer screening effects in 1$s$ and 2$p$  core-level X-ray photoemission spectra of early 3$d$ transition-metal oxides</h3>

<i>Tatsuya Yamaguchi, Keisuke Higashi, Anna Regoutz, Yoshihiro Takahashi, Masoud Lazemi, Qijun Ch, Frank M. F. de Groot, Atsushi Hariki</i>
<p>We present a comparative analysis of 1$s$ and 2$p$ core-level hard X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) spectra in metallic VO$_2$ and CrO$_2$.
Even though the V 1$s$ and 2$p$ spectra in VO$_2$ display similar line shapes
except the absence or presence of a spin-orbit coupling splitting, the Cr 1$s$
and 2$p$ spectra exhibit distinct main-line shapes. The experimental HAXPES
spectra are analyzed by the Anderson impurity model based on the density
functional theory + dynamical mean-field theory and a conventional MO$_6$
cluster model. We elucidate the complex interplay between formation of the
intra-atomic multiplet and charge transfer effect on the chemical bonding
followed by the 1$s$ and 2$p$ core electron excitations. We demonstrate the
advantage of the 1$s$ excitations to the routinely-employed 2$p$ excitations
for distinguishing between metal-ligand and metal-metal charge transfer
contributions in early 3$d$ transition-metal oxides.

<h3>Accelerating Structural Optimization through Fingerprinting Space  Integration on the Potential Energy Surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13953" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13953</a>
<br>
<i>Shuo Tao, Xuecheng Shao, Li Zhu</i>
<p>Structural optimization has been a crucial component in computational
materials research, and structure predictions have relied heavily on this
technique in particular. In this study, we introduce a novel method that
enhances the efficiency of local optimization by integrating an extra
fingerprint space into the optimization process. Our approach utilizes a mixed
energy concept in the hyper potential energy surface (PES), combining real
energy and a newly introduced fingerprint energy derived from the symmetry of
local atomic environment. This method strategically guides the optimization
process toward high-symmetry, low-energy structures by leveraging the intrinsic
symmetry of atomic configurations. The effectiveness of our approach was
demonstrated through structural optimizations of silicon, silicon carbide, and
Lennard-Jones cluster systems. Our results show that the fingerprint space
biasing technique significantly enhances the performance and probability of
discovering energetically favorable, high-symmetry structures, as compared to
conventional optimizations. The proposed method is anticipated to streamline
the search for new materials and facilitate the discovery of novel,
energetically favorable configurations.

<h3>Effects of Chemical Short Range Order on Percolation in Binary Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13954</a>
<br>
<i>Abhinav Roy, Karl Sieradzki, James M. Rondinelli, Ian D. McCue</i>
<p>We develop a percolation model for face centered cubic binary alloys with
chemical short-range order (SRO) to account for chemical ordering/clustering
that occurs in nominally random solid solutions. We employ a Monte Carlo
lattice generation scheme that directly utilizes the first nearest neighbor
Warren-Cowley SRO parameter to generate the lattice. We quantify the effects of
SRO on the first nearest neighbor 3D site percolation threshold using the large
cell Monte Carlo renormalization group method and find that the 3D site
percolation threshold is a function of the SRO parameter. We analyze the
effects of SRO on the chemical heterogeneity of the percolated structures and
find that short-ranged clustering promotes the formation of a dominant spanning
cluster. Furthermore, we find that the scaling exponents of percolation are
independent of SRO. We also examine the effects of SRO on the 2D-3D percolation
crossover and find that the thickness of the thin film for percolation
crossover is a function of the SRO parameter. We combine these results to
develop a percolation crossover model to understand the electrochemical
passivation behavior in binary alloys. The percolation crossover model provides
a theoretical framework to understand the critical composition of passivating
elements for protective oxide formation. With this model, we show that SRO can
be used as a processing parameter to improve corrosion resistance.

<h3>Unveiling a Novel Metal-to-Metal Transition in LuH2: Critically  Challenging Superconductivity Claims in Lutetium Hydrides</h3>

<p>Following the recent report by Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. (2023) of
near-ambient superconductivity in nitrogen-doped lutetium trihydride
(LuH3-{\delta}N{\epsilon}), significant debate has emerged surrounding the
composition and interpretation of the observed sharp resistance drop. Here, we
meticulously revisit these claims through comprehensive characterization and
investigations. We definitively identify the reported material as lutetium
dihydride (LuH2), resolving the ambiguity surrounding its composition. Under
similar conditions (270-295 K and 1-2 GPa), we replicate the reported sharp
decrease in electrical resistance with a 30% success rate, aligning with
Dasenbrock-Gammon et al.'s observations. However, our extensive investigations
reveal this phenomenon to be a novel, pressure-induced metal-to-metal
transition intrinsic to LuH2, distinct from superconductivity. Intriguingly,
nitrogen doping exerts minimal impact on this transition. Our work not only
elucidates the fundamental properties of LuH2 and LuH3 but also critically
challenges the notion of superconductivity in these lutetium hydride systems.
These findings pave the way for future research on lutetium hydride systems
while emphasizing the crucial importance of rigorous verification in claims of
ambient temperature superconductivity.

<h3>Buffer-layer-controlled Nickeline vs Zinc-Blende/Wurtzite-type MnTe  growths on c-plane Al2O3 substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13982" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13982</a>
<br>
<i>Deepti Jain, Hee Taek Yi, Alessandro R. Mazza, Kim Kisslinger, Myung-Geun Han, Matthew Brahlek, Seongshik Oh</i>
<p>In the recent past, MnTe has proven to be a crucial component of the
intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (IMTI) family [MnTe]m[Bi2Te3]n, which
hosts a wide range of magneto-topological properties depending on the choice of
m and n. However, bulk crystal growth allows only a few combinations of m and n
for these IMTIs due to the strict limitations of the thermodynamic growth
conditions. One way to overcome this challenge is to utilize atomic
layer-by-layer molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique, which allows arbitrary
sequences of [MnTe]m and [Bi2Te3]n to be formed beyond the thermodynamic limit.
For such MBE growth, finding optimal growth templates and conditions for the
parent building block, MnTe, is a key requirement. Here, we report that two
different hexagonal phases of MnTe-nickeline (NC) and zinc-blende/wurtzite
(ZB-WZ) structures, with distinct in-plane lattice constants of 4.20 +/- 0.04 A
and 4.39 +/- 0.04 A, respectively-can be selectively grown on c-plane Al2O3
substrates using different buffer layers and growth temperatures. Moreover, we
provide the first comparative studies of different MnTe phases using
atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and show that ZB
and WZ-like stacking sequences can easily alternate between the two.
Surprisingly, In2Se3 buffer layer, despite its lattice constant (4.02 A) being
closer to that of the NC phase, fosters the ZB-WZ instead, whereas Bi2Te3,
sharing the same lattice constant (4.39 A) with the ZB-WZ phase, fosters the NC
phase. These discoveries suggest that lattice matching is not always the most
critical factor determining the preferred phase during epitaxial growth.
Overall, this will deepen our understanding of epitaxial growth modes for
chalcogenide materials and accelerate progress toward new IMTI phases as well
as other magneto-topological applications.

<i>Verena Brehm, Stefan Stagraczynski, Jozef Barnas, Anna Dyrdal, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</i>
<p>Atomically-thin van der Waals magnetic materials offer exceptional
opportunities to mechanically and electrically manipulate magnetic states and
spin textures. The possibility of efficient spin transport in these materials
makes them promising for the development of novel nanospintronics technology.
Using atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we investigate magnetic ground
state, magnon dispersion, critical temperature, and magnon spin transport in
CrCl$_3$ bilayers in the absence and presence of compressive and tensile
strains. We show that in the presence of mechanical strain, the magnon band gap
at the $\Gamma$ point and the critical temperature of the bilayer are
increased. Furthermore, our simulations show that the magnon diffusion length
is reduced in the presence of strain. Moreover, by exciting magnons through the
spin Seebeck effect and spin Hall-induced torque, we illustrate distinctions
between magnon spin transport in the antiferromagnetic state, under compressive
strains, and ferromagnetic states, under tensile strains or in the unstrained
case.

<p>The standard cement paste (C-43-St) was studied previously by static heating,
SH, immediately after 1 month hydration at w/c = 0.4 [J. Therm. Anal. Calorim.

air) was subject to thermal analysis in air and in argon (DTA, DTG and TG), to
XRD at various temperatures, T, in a high temperature chamber, to mass
spectroscopy (MS) and to IR spectroscopy. The aim of this study was to compare
the results of SH (fresh paste) and of TG (the aged one), to verify the
assumptions made on SH interpretation and to check the change in hydration
products with ageing as measured by phase transformation on heating (deltaM
versus the final mass).

<h3>Localization of Lindbladian Fermions</h3>

<i>Foster Thompson, Yi Huang, Alex Kamenev</i>
<p>We study a Lindbladian generalization of the Anderson model of localization
that describes disordered free fermions coupled to a disordered environment.
From finite size scaling of both eigenvalue statistics and participation ratio,
we identify localization transitions in both the non-Hermitian Lindbladian
spectrum, which governs transient relaxation dynamics, and in the Hermitian
stationary state density matrix. These localization transitions occur at
different critical values of Hamiltonian and dissipative disorder strength,
implying the existence of atypical phases with a mixture of localized and
delocalized features. We find this phenomenon is robust to changes to the value
of the dissipative spectral gap.

<h3>A promising candidate for ising ferromagnetism of two-dimensional kagome  V$_2$O$_3$ honeycomb monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14035" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14035</a>
<br>
<i>Fazle Subhan, Chuanhao Gao, Luqman Ali, Yanguang Zhou, Zhenzhen Qin, Guangzhao Qin</i>
<p>Due to the low dimensionality in the quantization of the electronic states
and degree of freedom for device modulation, two-dimensional (2D)
ferromagnetism plays a critical role in lots of fields. In this study, we
perform first-principles calculation to investigate the ising ferromagnetism
and half-metallicity of kagome V$_2$O$_3$ monolayer. Based on the calculations
using different functional, it is found that GGA-PBE gives a half-metallic band
gap while the GGA+U gives a semiconductor narrow band gap (~1.1 meV), which
shows quasi-half metallic nature. By studying the magnetic properties with LDA,
GGA-PBE, and GGA+U, we get a robust ferromagnetic ground state, where the giant
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy of ~0.544 meV is achieved by applying
the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with GGA+U. Furthermore, by exploring the orbital
contribution to the electronic bands and the magnetic crystalline anisotropy,
it is uncovered that the 3d (V) orbitals contribute to the out-of-plane. The
electronic band structure shows two flat bands (F1 and F2) and Dirac points (D1
and D2) which further confirm that kagome V$_2$O$_3$ ML can also be used for
topological properties. Besides, the Curie temperature of the V$_2$O$_3$ ML is
calculated to be 640 K by Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

<i>Huan He, Junlei Zhao, Jesper Byggmästar, Ru He, Kai Nordlund, Chaohui He, Flyura Djurabekova</i>
<p>$\beta$ phase gallium oxide ($\beta$-$\rm Ga_2O_3$) demonstrates tremendous
potential for electronics applications and offers promising prospects for
integration into future space systems with the necessity of high radiation
resistance. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the threshold
displacement energy (TDE) and the radiation-induced formation of Frenkel pairs
(FPs) in this material is vital but has not yet been thoroughly studied. In
this work, we performed over 5,000 molecular dynamics simulations using our
machine-learning potentials to determine the TDE and investigate the formation
of FPs. The average TDEs for the two Ga sites, Ga1 (tetrahedral site) and Ga2
(octahedral site), are 22.9 and 20.0 eV, respectively. While the average TDEs
for the three O sites are nearly uniform, ranging from 17.0 to 17.4 eV. The
generated TDE maps reveal significant differences in displacement behavior
between these five atomic sites. Our developed defect identification methods
successfully categorize various types of FPs in this material, with more than
ten types of Ga FPs being produced during our simulations. O atoms are found to
form two main types of FPs and the O split interstitial site on O1 site is most
common. Finally, the recombination behavior and barriers of Ga and O FPs
indicate that the O FP has a higher possibility of recovery upon annealing. Our
findings provide important insights into the studies of radiation damage and
defects in $\rm Ga_2O_3$ and can contribute to the design and development of
$\rm Ga_2O_3$-based devices

<h3>Thermal and Magnetoelastic Properties of the van der Waals Ferromagnet  Fe$_{3-δ}$GeTe$_2$: Anisotropic Spontaneous Magnetostriction and  Ferromagnetic Magnon Excitations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14050" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14050</a>
<br>
<i>R. K. Kremer, E. Bruecher</i>
<p>By determining the lattice parameters as a function of temperature of the
hexagonal van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_{2.92(1)}$Ge$_{1.02(3)}$Te$_2$ we
obtain the temperature dependence of the spontaneous in-plane magnetostriction
in the ferromagnetic and the linear thermal expansion coefficients in the
paramagnetic state. The spontaneous magnetostriction is clearly seen in the
temperature dependence of the in-plane lattice parameter $a(T)$, but less well
pronounced perpendicular to the planes along $c$. Below $T_{\rm C}$ the
spontaneous magnetostriction follows the square of the magnetization and leads
to an expansion of the hexagonal layers. Extrapolating to $T\rightarrow$ 0~K we
obtain a spontaneous in-plane saturation magnetostriction of $\lambda_{{\rm
sp},a}(T \rightarrow 0) \approx-220 ~\times~10^{-6}$. In the paramagnetic state
the linear thermal expansion coefficients amount to
13.9(1)$\times$10$^{-6}$~K$^{-1}$ and to 23.2(2)$\times$10$^{-6}$~K$^{-1}$ for
the in-plane and out-of-plane direction, respectively, indicating a linear
volume thermal expansion coefficient of 50.8(4)$\times$10$^{-6}$K$^{-1}$ which
we use to estimate the volume thermal expansion contribution to the heat
capacity determined at constant pressure. A Sommerfeld-type linear term in the
low-temperature heat capacities can be quantitatively ascribed to 2dim
ferromagnetic magnon excitations.

<h3>Few-magnon excitations in a frustrated spin-$S$ ferromagnetic chain</h3>

<i>Jiawei Li, Ye Cao, Ning Wu</i>
<p>We study few-magnon excitations in a finite-size spin-$S$ ferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor (NN) XXZ chain with additional antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $J'$ and single-ion (SI) anisotropy
$D$. Using a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states, the two-magnon problem is
mapped to a single-particle one on an effective open chain with both NN and NNN
hoppings. For the commensurate momentum $k=-\pi$, the effective chain is
decoupled into two NN open chains that can be exactly solved via a plane-wave
ansatz. Based on this, we identify in the $\Delta'-D/|J'|$ plane (with
$\Delta'$ the anisotropy parameter for the NNN coupling) the regions supporting
the SI or NNN exchange two-magnon bound states near the edge of the band. We
prove that there always exists a lower-energy NN exchange two-magnon bound
state near the band edge. For $S=1/2$, we numerically calculate the $n$-magnon
spectra for $n\leq5$ by using a spin-operator matrix element method. The
corresponding $n$-magnon commensurate instability regions are determined for
finite chains and consistent results with prior literature are observed.

<p>Redox and catalytic performance in total methane oxidation of a
nonostructured ceria-terbia catalyst supported on magnesia is presented and
compared to that of a pure ceria catalyst supported on MgO. The investigated
material, Ce0.5Tb0.5Ox (3% mol.)/MgO, features several remarkable properties: a
quite low total molar loading of the two lanthanide elements, high
reducibility, as well as very high oxygen storage capacity al low temperatures
and higher activity than MgO-supported ceria. In terms of lanthanide atomic
content the catalytic performance of Ce0.5Tb0.5Ox (3% mol.)/MgO largely
improves compared to that of bulk type ceria and ceria-magnesia solid
solutions. Such a behavior implies proper optimization of the usage of
lanthanide elements. A second contribution to atomic economy in the catalyst
design relates to the fact that the new formulation demonstrate a stabilyty in
the redox and catalytic performance against very high temperature treatments.
An investigation on the structure of both the fresh and high-temperature-aged
catalyst at the atomic scale by means of complementary aberration corrected
microscopy techniques, reveals the ocuurrence of a variety of exotic,
lanthanide-containing nanostructures, which span fron isolated, atomically
dispersed Ln species to nonometer-sized CeTbO2-x patches, extended CeTbO2-x
bilayers and 2D CeTbO2-x nanoparticles. Nanoanalytical results evidence the
mixing of the two lanthanides at atomic levels in these nanostructures. The
combined effects of nanostructuring, mixing of the lanthanides at the atomic
level, and interaction with the MgO oxide are the roots of the improvement in
funtional, redox and catalytic properties of the novel Ce0.5Tb0.5Ox (3%
mol.)/MgO catalyst.

<p>Impregnation treatments are one of the alternatives to protect concrete-based
building and monuments from weathering degradation. However, it is important to
consider the chemical compatibility of the reaction products with the building
material. The impregnation product studied here consists of a silica oligomer
able to polymerize, by a simple sol-gel process, inside the pore structure of
concrete. In this work, we investigate the ability of this impregnation
treatment to produce C-S-H gel in contact with cement paste. A complete
characterization of the reaction products demonstrated that the silanol groups
from silica oligomers react with the portlandite present in the cement paste
generating a material with the chemical, structural and morphological features
of CS-H gel. Simultaneously, the 29Si NMR results indicate that the Si-O units
are incorporated into the existing C-S-H, increasing its chain length. These
results open the way for a simple concrete structures repairing procedure.

<p>Kelvin probe microscopy (KPFM) is a well-established scanning probe
technique, used to measure surface potential accurately; it has found extensive
use in the study of a range of materials phenomena. In its conventional form,
KPFM frustratingly precludes imaging samples or scenarios where large surface
potential exists or large surface potential gradients are created outside the
typical +/-10V window. If the potential regime measurable via KPFM could be
expanded, to enable precise and reliable metrology, through a high voltage KPFM
(HV-KPFM) adaptation, it could open up pathways towards a range of novel
experiments, where the detection limit of regular KPFM has so far prevented the
use of the technique. In this work, HV-KPFM has been realised and shown to be
capable of measuring large surface potential and potential gradients with
accuracy and precision. The technique has been employed to study a range of
materials (positive temperature coefficient of resistivity ceramics, charge
storage fluoropolymers and pyroelectrics) where accurate spatially resolved
mapping of surface potential within high voltage regime facilitates novel
physical insight. The results demonstrate that HV-KPFM can be used as an
effective tool to fill in existing gaps in surface potential measurements while
also opening routes for novel studies in materials physics.

<i>Huiyan Pan, Xiaowei Chen, Oihane Sanz, Miguel A. Cauqui, Jose M. Rodriguez-Izquierdo, Juan J. Delgado</i>
<p>Cryptomelane has been widely applied as catalyst in oxidation reactions due
to its excellent redox properties and low cost. Here, a novel one-pot
hydrothermal synthesis using a potassium permanganate aqueous solution as
precursor and ethanol as reducing agent has successfully been developed to
obtain cryptomelane nano-oxides. This synthetic route makes it possible to
control the amount of potassium incorporated into the structure of the
cryptomelane by selecting the appropriate synthesis temperature and ethanol
initial concentration. Taking advantage of this approach, the effect of
potassium concentration on the structural stability and reducibility of the
cryptomelane, which are poorly discussed in the literature, has been studied.
We have observed that samples with low content of potassium (~11%) show high
conversions of CO to CO2 especially at low temperatures. The lower activity of
the samples with high K contents (~16%) can be ascribed to the beneficial
effect of K on the structural stability of cryptomelane in detriment of labile
oxygen on cryptomelane surface.

<p>Recently, Hall effect measurements are done on Lanthanum doped Strontium
Iridate \(Sr_{2-x}La_{x}IrO_{4}\) which is 5d analogue of cuprates
\cite{hsu2023carrier}. Hall effect measurements show that the effective carrier
density \(n_{H}\) exhibits a crossover from \(n_{H} \sim x\) to \(n_{H} \sim
1+x\) near \(x\simeq 0.16\) . This is very similar to that found in cuprates
around $p\simeq0.19$. It is proposed that a pseudogap (PG) state in
\(Sr_{2-x}La_{x}IrO_{4}\) exists and is ending at \(x\simeq 0.16\)
\cite{hsu2023carrier}. However, PG boundary (in doping-temperature phase
diagram) remains unknown. In this work, we apply a very successfull the
Gor'kov-Teitel'baum Thermal Activation (GTTA) model to
\(Sr_{2-x}La_{x}IrO_{4}\) and obtain its PG phase boundary and draw an updated
phase diagram. Our results agree with previously known signatures of PG phase
in this system \cite{seo2017infrared,de2015collapse}. Using results from GTTA
model we also obtain the evolution of "Fermi arcs" in this system as a function
%of both doping and temperature for doping concentration $x\simeq0.08$ which
are in qualitative agreement with the reported results.

<p>Active matter systems - such as a collection of active colloidal particles -
operate far from equilibrium with complex inter-particle interactions that
govern their collective dynamics. Predicting the collective dynamics of such
systems may aid the design of self-shaping structures comprised of active
colloidal units with a prescribed dynamical function. Here, using theory and
simulations, we study the dynamics of a chemically self-interacting active
colloidal chain consisting of active Brownian particles connected by harmonic
springs in two dimensions to obtain design principles for extended structures
of active colloidal particles. We show that two-dimensional confinement and
chemo-repulsive interactions between the freely jointed active particles lead
to an emergent rigidity in the steady-state dynamics. In the chemo-attractive
regime, the chains fold into crystals that abruptly halt their motion. Further,
in an active chain consisting of a binary mixture of monomers, we show that
anti-symmetric chemical affinities between distinct species give rise to novel
phenomena, such as sustained oscillations and reversal of the direction of
motion.

<p>Topological insulators (TIs) are emerging materials for next-generation
low-power nanoelectronic and spintronic device applications. TIs possess
non-trivial spin-momentum locking features in the topological surface states in
addition to the spin-Hall effect (SHE), and Rashba states due to high
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) properties. These phenomena are vital for observing
the charge-spin conversion (CSC) processes for spin-based memory, logic and
quantum technologies. Although CSC has been observed in TIs by potentiometric
measurements, reliable nonlocal detection has so far been limited to cryogenic
temperatures up to T = 15 K. Here, we report nonlocal detection of CSC and its
inverse effect in the TI compound Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 at room temperature
using a van der Waals heterostructure with a graphene spin-valve device. The
lateral nonlocal device design with graphene allows observation of both
spin-switch and Hanle spin precession signals for generation, injection and
detection of spin currents by the TI. Detailed bias- and gate-dependent
measurements in different geometries prove the robustness of the CSC effects in
the TI. These findings demonstrate the possibility of using topological
materials to make all-electrical room-temperature spintronic devices.

<h3>Effects of mechanical treatment and exchanged cation on the  microporosity of vermiculite</h3>

<p>The influence of the interlayer cations, sonication and grinding on surface
area of the vermiculite from Santa Olalla has been studied. For untreated
samples the surface area increases with the size of the exchanged cation and
only the samples with the largest cations (NH+ and K+) show some microporosity.
Sonication produces an increase of the surface area but the amount of
micropores remains almost unchanged. Grinding leads to a significant increase
of the surface area and of the microporosity. In the ground samples the
percentage of micropores contributing to the surface area is influenced by the
interlayer cation and the extent of N2 penetration by the water kept in the
sample at a given degassing temperature. From transmission electron microscopy,
thermogravimetry and XRD (d00l diffraction peaks) it can be concluded that
grinding produces imperfections in crystal ordering, some alteration in the
crystal edges, and a significant release of loosely bound water at temperatures
up to 450 8C. These effects are responsible for the high surface area and
microporosity measured by the N2 adsorption.

<h3>The explicit bonding Reaction ensemble Monte Carlo method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14288" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14288</a>
<br>
<i>Pablo M. Blanco, Peter Košovan</i>
<p>We present the explicit bonding Reaction ensemble Monte Carlo (eb-RxMC)
method, designed to sample reversible bonding reactions in macromolecular
systems. Our eb-RxMC differs from the original Reaction ensemble method by
explicitly adding or deleting bonds between the reactive particles, instead of
exchanging particles with the virtual reservoir. Our eb-RxMC algorithm is
biased to sample only the reaction within an inclusion radius, which allows to
couple it with Molecular Dynamics algorithm to sample the reaction and
configuration space concomitantly. We validate our algorithm for a set of
ideally behaving systems undergoing dimerization and polycondensation
reactions, for which analytical results are available. Namely, we showed that
for dimerization reactions with different equilibrium constant and initial
compositions, the degree of conversion measured in our simulations perfectly
matched the reference value given by the analytical equations, irrespective of
the choice of the inclusion radius or the stiffness of the harmonic potential.
Next, we showed that our simulations can correctly match the analytical results
for the chain length distribution and end-to-end distance of ideal chains in
polycondensation reactions. Altogether, we show that our eb-RxMC simulations
correctly sample both the reaction and the configuration space of these
reference systems, opening the door to future simulations of more complex
interacting macromolecular systems.

<h3>Theory of Acoustic Polarons in the Two-Dimensional SSH Model Applied to  the Layered Superatomic Semiconductor Re6Se8Cl2</h3>

<i>Petra Shih, Timothy C. Berkelbach</i>
<p>Layered superatomic semiconductors, whose buildings blocks are atomically
precise molecular clusters, exhibit interesting electronic and vibrational
properties. In recent work [Science 382, 438 (2023)], transient reflection
microscopy revealed quasi-ballistic exciton dynamics in Re6Se8Cl2, which was
attributed to the formation of polarons due to coupling with acoustic phonons.
Here, we characterize the electronic, excitonic, and phononic properties with
periodic density functional theory. We further parameterize a polaron
Hamiltonian with nonlocal [Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)] coupling to acoustic
phonon to study the polaron ground state binding energy and dispersion relation
with variational wavefunctions. We calculate a polaron binding energy of about
10 meV at room temperature, and the maximum group velocity of our polaron
dispersion relation is 1.5 km/s, which is similar to the experimentally
observed exciton transport velocity.

<h3>Rotating effects on the photoionization cross-section of a 2D quantum  ring</h3>

<i>Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Frankbelson dos S. Azevedo, Luís Fernando C. Pereira, Edilberto O. Silva</i>
<p>In this letter, we investigate the nonrelativistic quantum motion of a
charged particle within a rotating frame, taking into account the Aharonov-Bohm
(AB) effect and a uniform magnetic field. Our analysis entails the derivation
of the equation of motion and the corresponding radial equation to describe the
system. Solving the resulting radial equation enables us to determine the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, providing a clear expression for the energy
levels. Furthermore, our numerical analysis highlights the substantial
influence of rotation on both energy levels and optical properties.
Specifically, we evaluate the photoionization cross-section (PCS) with and
without the effects of rotation. To elucidate the impact of rotation on the
photoionization process of the system, we present graphics that offer an
appealing visualization of the intrinsic nature of the physics involved.

<h3>Universal collective Larmor-Silin mode emerging in magnetized correlated  Dirac fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14358" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14358</a>
<br>
<i>Chuang Chen, Yuan Da Liao, Chengkang Zhou, Gaopei Pan, Zi Yang Meng, Yang Qi</i>
<p>Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find in magnetized
interacting Dirac fermion model, there emerges a new and universal collective
Larmor-Silin spin wave mode in the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility.
Such mode purely originates from the interaction among Dirac fermions and
distinguishes itself from the usual particle-hole continuum with finite
lifetime and clear dispersion. Our unbiased numerical results offer the dynamic
signature of this new collective excitations in interacting Dirac fermion
systems, and provide experimental guidance for inelastic neutron scattering,
electron spin resonance and other spectroscopic approaches in the investigation
of such universal collective modes in quantum Moire materials, topological
insulators and quantum spin liquid materials under magnetic field, with
quintessential interaction nature beyond the commonly assumed noninteracting
Dirac fermion or spinon approximations.

<h3>Stoichiometric control of electron mobility and 2D superconductivity at  LaAlO$_3$-SrTiO$_3$ interfaces</h3>

<p>SrTiO$_3$-based conducting interfaces, which exhibit coexistence of
gate-tunable 2D superconductivity and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC),
are candidates to host topological superconductive phases. Yet,
superconductivity is usually in the dirty limit, which tends to suppress
nonconventional pairing and therefore challenges these expectations. Here we
report on LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) interfaces with remarkably large
mobility and mean free paths comparable to the superconducting coherence
length, approaching the clean limit for superconductivity. We further show that
the carrier density, mobility, and formation of the superconducting condensate
are controlled by the fine-tuning of La/Al chemical ratio in the LAO film.
Interestingly, we find a region in the superconducting phase diagram where the
critical temperature is not suppressed below the Lifshitz transition, at odds
with previous experimental investigations. These findings point out the
relevance of achieving a clean-limit regime to enhance the observation of
unconventional pairing mechanisms in these systems

<h3>Anomalous localization in spin-chain with tilted interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14369" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14369</a>
<br>
<i>Arindam Mallick, Jakub Zakrzewski</i>
<p>The localization properties of a disorder-free spin chain with inhomogeneous
interactions are studied. In particular, we consider interaction strength
growing linearly along the chain for systems with different interaction ranges.
Using exact diagonalization we find the participation ratio of all eigenstates
which allows us to quantify the localization volume in the Hilbert space.
Surprisingly the localization volume changes nonmonotonically with the
interaction range. The model for the infinite interaction range resembles the
Schwinger model of lattice gauge theory in staggered formalism. The model
studied may be implemented in state-of-the-art cold atomic devices and could
reveal hidden features in disorder-free confinement phenomena.

<h3>Single-file dynamics with general charge measures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14378" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14378</a>
<br>
<i>Žiga Krajnik</i>
<p>We study charge fluctuations in single-file dynamics with general charge
measures. The exact finite-time distribution of charge fluctuations is obtained
in terms of a dressing transformation acting on the finite-time distribution of
particle fluctuations. The transformation is mapped to a simple substitution
rule for corresponding full-counting statistics. By taking the asymptotics of
the dressing transformation we analyze typical and large scale charge
fluctuations. Typical charge fluctuations in equilibrium states with vanishing
mean charge are anomalous while large charge fluctuations undergo first and
second order dynamical phase transitions out of equilibrium.

<h3>Peierls-like distortion drives anion ordering in rutile TiOF</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14386" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14386</a>
<br>
<i>Siddhartha S. Nathan, Danilo Puggioni, James M. Rondinelli</i>
<p>We use first principles density functional theory calculations to examine the
effect of multiple anions on the Peierls distortion in the rutile oxyfluoride
TiOF. By using a structure enumeration approach, we obtain the ground state
atomic structure for TiOF and identify the driving forces behind the
experimentally observed two-dimensional anion ordering along rutile (110)
planes. We find that adjacent edge-connected octahedra comprise like atoms with
an --O-O/F-F/O-O/F-F-- pattern along the rutile [001] direction. This anion
pattern coexists with a Peierls-like distortion leading to the formation of a
singlet state between neighboring Ti$^{3+}$ cations. We show that the anion
ordering arises from competition between electrostatic interactions, owing to
the Ti-F cation-anion pairs, and the tendency of the $d^1$ Ti$^{3+}$ cation to
form Ti-Ti dimers, characterized by increased metal-metal bonding. We find that
the addition of strong on-site Coulombic interactions to the Ti $d$ manifold
suppresses the formation of the singlet state. By increasing the correlation
strength, we uncover two first-order phase transitions: first, from a
nonmagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic half-metal, and then second to a
ferromagnetic insulator. Last, we show that the electronic configuration of the
transition metal cation in rutile oxyfluorides is responsible for the observed
anion order, enabling design of ordered heteroanionic materials exhibiting
collective phenomena through cation sublattice control.

<h3>Entanglement entropy and deconfined criticality: emergent SO(5) symmetry  and proper lattice bipartition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14396" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14396</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan D'Emidio, Anders W. Sandvik</i>
<p>We study the R\'enyi entanglement entropy (EE) of the two-dimensional $J$-$Q$
model, the emblematic quantum spin model of deconfined criticality at the phase
transition between antiferromagnetic and valence-bond-solid ground states.
Quantum Monte Carlo simulations with an improved EE scheme reveal critical
corner contributions that scale logarithmically with the system size, with a
coefficient in remarkable agreement with the form expected from a large-$N$
conformal field theory with SO($N=5$) symmetry. However, details of the
bipartition of the lattice are crucial in order to observe this behavior. If
the subsystem for the reduced density matrix does not properly accommodate
valence-bond fluctuations, logarithmic contributions appear even for
corner-less bipartitions. We here use a $45^\circ$ tilted cut on the square
lattice. Beyond supporting an SO($5$) deconfined quantum critical point, our
results for both the regular and tilted cuts demonstrate important microscopic
aspects of the EE that are not captured by conformal field theory.
