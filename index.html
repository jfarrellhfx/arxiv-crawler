<h3>Cubic Double Perovskites Host Noncoplanar Spin Textures</h3>

Magnetic materials with noncoplanar magnetic structures can show unusual
physical properties driven by nontrivial topology. Topologically-active states
are often multi-q structures, which are challenging to stabilize in models and
to identify in materials. Here, we use inelastic neutron-scattering experiments
to show that the insulating double perovskites Ba2YRuO6 and Ba2LuRuO6 host a
noncoplanar 3-q structure on the face-centered cubic lattice. Quantitative
analysis of our neutron-scattering data reveals that these 3-q states are
stabilized by biquadratic interactions. Our study identifies double perovskites
as a highly promising class of materials to realize topological magnetism,
elucidates the stabilization mechanism of the 3-q state in these materials, and
establishes neutron spectroscopy on powder samples as a valuable technique to
distinguish multi-q from single-q states, facilitating the discovery of
topologically-nontrivial magnetic materials.

<h3>Active Spaghetti: Collective Organization in Cyanobacteria</h3>

Filamentous cyanobacteria can show fascinating patterns of self-organization,
which however are not well-understood from a physical perspective. We
investigate the motility and collective organization of colonies of these
simple multicellular lifeforms. As their area density increases, linear chains
of cells gliding on a substrate show a transition from an isotropic
distribution to bundles of filaments arranged in a reticulate pattern. Based on
our experimental observations of individual behavior and pairwise interactions,
we introduce a model accounting for the filaments' large aspect ratio,
fluctuations in curvature, motility, and nematic interactions. This minimal
model of active filaments recapitulates the observations, and rationalizes the
appearance of a characteristic lengthscale in the system, based on the Peclet
number of the cyanobacteria filaments.

The transport properties of colloidal particles in active liquids have been
studied extensively. It has led to a deeper understanding of the interactions
between passive and active particles. However, the phase behavior of colloidal
particles in active media has received little attention. Here, we present a
combined experimental and numerical investigation of passive colloids dispersed
in suspensions of active particles. Our study reveals dynamic clustering of
colloids in active media due to an interplay of active noise and an attractive
effective potential between the colloids. The size-ratio of colloidal particles
to the bacteria sets the strength of the interaction. As the relative size of
the colloids increases, the effective potential becomes stronger and the
average size of the clusters grows. The simulations reveal a macroscopic phase
separation of passive colloids at sufficiently large size-ratios. We will
present the role of density fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions in the
emergence of effective interactions.

<h3>Spontaneous velocity alignment of Brownian particles with  feedback-induced propulsion</h3>

<i>Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on Brownian dynamics simulations we study the collective behavior of a
two-dimensional system of repulsively interacting colloidal particles, where
each particle is propelled by a repulsive feedback force with time delay
$\tau$. Although the pair interactions are purely isotropic we observe a
spontaneous, large-scale alignment of the velocity vectors. This phenomenon
persists for long times and occurs, at high densities, in the absence of
steady-state clustering. We explain our observations by a combination of the
effect of steric interactions yielding local velocity ordering, and the effect
of time delay, that generates velocity persistence and cluster dissolution.
Overall, the behavior reveals intriguing similarities, but also subtle
differences, to systems of active particles.

<h3>A ferromagnetic Eu-Pt surface compound grown below hexagonal boron  nitride</h3>

One of the fundamental applications for monolayer-thick 2D materials is their
use as protective layers of metal surfaces and in-situ intercalated reactive
materials in ambient conditions. Here we investigate the structural,
electronic, and magnetic properties, as well as the chemical stability in air
of a very reactive metal, Europium, after intercalation between a hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) layer and a Pt substrate. We demonstrate that Eu
intercalation leads to a hBN-protected ferromagnetic EuPt$_2$ surface alloy
with divalent Eu$^{2+}$ atoms. We expose the system to ambient conditions and
find a partial shielding of the Eu-Pt interface, which remains ferromagnetic.
The use of a curved Pt substrate allows us to explore ferromagnetism and the
ambient pressure protection with other substrate planes. The interfacial
EuPt$_2$ surface alloy formation remains the same, but the resistance to
ambient conditions is reduced, likely due to a rougher surface and a more
discontinuous hBN coating.

<h3>Topological Nodal Point Superconductivity in Checkerboard  Magnet-Superconductor Hybrid Systems</h3>

We demonstrate that checkerboard magnet-superconductor hybrid systems possess
a rich phase diagram exhibiting both strong topological superconducting (STSC)
and topological nodal point superconducting (TNPSC) phases. We show that TNPSC
phases exist both for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, yielding a
plethora of qualitatively different edge mode structures. Checkerboard MSH
systems also facilitate the emergence of STSC phases which can be induced even
in the limit of vanishing magnetization. Our results provide a new path for the
quantum engineering of topological superconducting phases using atomic
manipulation techniques.

Low dimensional carbon-based materials are interesting because they can show
intrinsic $\pi$-magnetism associated to p-electrons residing in specific
open-shell configurations. Consequently, during the last years there have been
impressive advances in the field combining indirect experimental fingerprints
of localized magnetic moments with theoretical models. In spite of that, a
characterization of their spatial- and energy-resolved spin-moment has so far
remained elusive. To obtain this information, we present an approach based on
the stabilization of the magnetization of $\pi$-orbitals by virtue of a
supporting substrate with ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, we go beyond
localized magnetic moments in radical or faulty carbon sites: In our study,
energy-dependent spin-moment distributions have been extracted from spatially
extended one-dimensional edge states of chiral graphene nanoribbons. This
method can be generalized to other nanographene structures, representing an
essential validation of these materials for their use in spintronics and
quantum technologies.

The nanocrystalline Ni0.7Cu0.3AlxFe2-xO4 (x=0.00: 0.02: 0.10) is prepared
through the sol-gel autocombustion route.Both XRD and Rietveld confirm the
single-phase cubic spinel structure of the investigated materials.Other
structural parameters refined by the Rietveld refinement analysis are
corroborated to single-phase cubic spinel formation of the NPs.Leveraging a
vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) the consequence of Al3+ substitution on the
magnetic parameters is studied.The saturation magnetization (MS) and Bohr
magneton are found to decrease with Al3+ substitution.The Remanence ratio and
coercivity (HC) are observed to be very low suggesting the materials are soft
ferromagnetic.First-principle calculations were carried out using the density
functional theory (DFT) to demonstrate the optoelectronic behavior of the
materials.The electronic bandgap is found low as Eg=2.99eV for the explored
materials with observing defect states at 0.62eV.The optoelectronic properties
of Al3+ substituted Ni-Cu ferrite NPs have been characterized through the DFT
simulation for the first time, demonstrating their potentiality for
optoelectronic device applications.The materials' optical anisotropy is
observed along the x-axis, which manifests their tunability through
light-matter interaction.

The domain wall-magnetic tunnel junction (DW-MTJ) is a versatile device that
can simultaneously store data and perform computations. These three-terminal
devices are promising for digital logic due to their nonvolatility, low-energy
operation, and radiation hardness. Here, we augment the DW-MTJ logic gate with
voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) to improve the reliability of
logical concatenation in the presence of realistic process variations. VCMA
creates potential wells that allow for reliable and repeatable localization of
domain walls. The DW-MTJ logic gate supports different fanouts, allowing for
multiple inputs and outputs for a single device without affecting area. We
simulate a systolic array of DW-MTJ Multiply-Accumulate (MAC), which uses the
nonvolatility of DW-MTJ logic gates to enable fine-grained pipelining and
achieve massive parallelism. The DW-MTJ 8-bit systolic array provides
comparable throughput and efficiency to state-of-the-art CMOS systolic arrays
while being radiation-hard. These results improve the feasibility of using
domain wall-based processors, especially for extreme-environment applications
such as space.

<h3>Noise and Thermal Depinning of Wigner Crystals</h3>

We examine changes in the depinning threshold and conduction noise
fluctuations for driven Wigner crystals in the presence of quenched disorder.
At low temperatures there is a well defined depinning threshold and a strong
peak in the noise power with $1/f$ noise characteristics. At higher
temperatures, the depinning threshold shifts to lower drives and the noise,
which is also reduced in power, becomes more white in character. At lower
temperatures, a washboard frequency appears when the system depins elastically
or forms a moving smectic state; however, this washboard signal is strongly
reduced for higher temperatures and completely disappears above the melting
temperature of a system without quenched disorder. Our results are in good
agreement with recent transport and noise studies for systems where electron
crystal depinning is believed to arise, and also show how noise can be used to
distinguish between crystal, glass, and liquid phases.

<h3>A Quantum Monte Carlo study of the structural, energetic, and magnetic  properties of two-dimensional (2D) H and T phase VSe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Previous works have controversially claimed near-room temperature
ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) VSe$_2$, with conflicting results
throughout the literature. These discrepancies in magnetic properties between
both phases (T and H phase) of 2D VSe$_2$ are most likely due to the structural
parameters being coupled to the magnetic properties. Specifically, both phases
have a close lattice match and similar total energies, which makes it difficult
to determine which phase is being observed experimentally. In this study, we
used a combination of density functional theory (DFT), highly accurate
diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and a surrogate Hessian line-search optimization
technique to resolve the previously reported discrepancy in structural
parameters and relative phase stability. With DMC accuracy, we determined the
freestanding geometry of both phases and constructed a phase diagram. Our
findings demonstrate the successes of the DMC method coupled with the surrogate
Hessian structural optimization technique when applied to a 2D magnetic system.

Ongoing advances in superconductors continue to revolutionize technology
thanks to the increasingly versatile and robust availability of lossless
supercurrent. In particular high supercurrent density can lead to more
efficient and compact power transmission lines, high-field magnets, as well as
high-performance nanoscale radiation detectors and superconducting spintronics.
Here, we report the discovery of an unprecedentedly high superconducting
critical current density (17 MA/cm2 at 0 T and 7 MA/cm2 at 8 T) in 1T'-WS2,
exceeding those of all reported two-dimensional superconductors to date.
1T'-WS2 features a strongly anisotropic (both in- and out-of-plane)
superconducting state that violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit signaling the
presence of unconventional superconductivity. Spectroscopic imaging of the
vortices further substantiates the anisotropic nature of the superconducting
state. More intriguingly, the normal state of 1T'-WS2 carries topological
properties. The band structure obtained via angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and first-principles calculations points to a Z2 topological
invariant. The concomitance of topology and superconductivity in 1T'-WS2
establishes it as a topological superconductor candidate, which is promising
for the development of quantum computing technology.

<h3>Resetting induced multimodality</h3>

Properties of stochastic systems are defined by the noise type and
deterministic forces. In out-of-equilibrium setups, e.g., for motions under
action of L\'evy noises, the existence of the stationary state is not only
determined by the potential but also by a noise. Potential wells need to be
steeper than parabolic in order to assure existence of stationary states. The
existence of stationary states, in sub-harmonic potential wells, can be
restored by stochastic resetting, which is the protocol of starting over.
Herein we demonstrate that the combined action of L\'evy noise and Poissonian
stochastic resetting can result in the phase transition between stationary
states of various multimodality in the overdamped system. Fine-tuned resetting
rates can increase the modality of stationary states, while for high resetting
rates the multimodality is destroyed.

<h3>Far-Infrared Signatures for a Two-Steps Pressure-Driven Metallization in  Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a high-pressure investigation of the semiconductor-to-metal
transition in MoS2 and WS2 carried out by synchrotron-based far-infrared
spectroscopy, to reconcile the controversial estimates of the metallization
pressure found in the literature and gain new insight into the mechanisms
ruling this electronic transition. Two spectral descriptors are found
indicative of the onset of metallicity and of the origin of the free carriers
in the metallic state: the absorbance spectral weight, whose abrupt increase
defines the metallization pressure threshold, and the asymmetric lineshape of
the E1u peak, whose pressure evolution, interpreted within the Fano model,
suggests the electrons in the metallic state originate from n-type doping
levels. Combining our results with those reported in the literature, we
hypothesize a two-step mechanism is at work in the metallization process, in
which the pressure-induced hybridization between doping and conduction band
states drives an early metallic behaviour, while the band-gap closes at higher
pressures.

<h3>Switchable anomalous Hall effects in polar-stacked 2D antiferromagnet  MnBi2Te4</h3>

Van der Waals (vdW) assembly allows controlling symmetry of two-dimensional
(2D) materials that determines their physical properties. Especially
interesting is the recently demonstrated breaking inversion symmetry by polar
layer stacking to realize novel electronic, magnetic, and transport properties
of 2D vdW materials switchable by induced electric polarization. Here, based on
symmetry analyses and density-functional calculations, we explore the emergence
of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 films
assembled by polar layer stacking. We demonstrate that breaking PT symmetry in
an MnBi2Te4 bilayer makes this 2D material magnetoelectric and produces a
spontaneous AHE switchable by electric polarization. We find that reversable
polarization at one of the interfaces in a three-layer MnBi2Te4 film drives a
metal-insulator transition, as well as switching between an AHE and quantum AHE
(QAHE). Finally, we predict that engineering an interlayer polarization in a
three-layer MnBi2Te4 film allows converting MnBi2Te4 from a trivial insulator
to a Chern insulator. Overall, our work emphasizes the emergence of
quantum-transport phenomena in 2D vdW antiferromagnets by polar layer stacking,
which do not exist in this material in the bulk or bulk-like thin-film forms.

<h3>Coupled continuum modeling of size-segregation driven by  shear-strain-rate gradients and flow in dense, bidisperse granular media</h3>

Dense granular systems that consist of particles of disparate sizes segregate
based on size during flow, resulting in complex, coupled segregation and flow
patterns. The ability to predict how granular mixtures segregate is important
in the design of industrial processes and the understanding of geophysical
phenomena. The two primary drivers of size-segregation are pressure gradients
and shear-strain-rate gradients. In this work, we isolate size-segregation
driven by shear-strain-rate gradients by studying two dense granular flow
geometries with constant pressure fields: gravity-driven flow down a long
vertical chute with rough parallel walls and annular shear flow with rough
inner and outer walls. We perform discrete element method (DEM) simulations of
dense flow of bidisperse granular systems in both flow geometries, while
varying system parameters, such as the flow rate, flow configuration size,
fraction of large/small grains, and grain-size ratio, and use DEM data to
inform continuum constitutive equations for the relative flux of large and
small particles. When the resulting continuum model for the dynamics of
size-segregation is coupled with the nonlocal granular fluidity model (a
nonlocal continuum model for dense granular flow rheology), we show that both
flow fields and segregation dynamics may be simultaneously captured using this
coupled, continuum system of equations.

<h3>Superconductivity of anomalous pseudospin</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11458" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11458</a>

<br>
<br>
In materials with both time-reversal ($T$) and inversion symmetry ($I$),
superconductivity is formed by pairing fermion pseudospin partners at momenta
${\boldsymbol{k}}$ and $-{\boldsymbol{k}}$. Typically, pseudospin shares the
same symmetry properties as usual spin-1/2. Here we consider non-symmorphic
materials with momentum space spin-textures that exhibit an anomalous
pseudospin with different symmetry properties than usual spin-1/2. We provide a
comprehensive list of space groups for which anomalous pseudospin occurs on
planes in momentum space and carry out a complete categorization and analysis
of superconductivity for Fermi surfaces centered on all possible $T$, $I$
invariant momenta (TRIM) in these planes. We show that superconductivity from
this anomalous pseudospin leads to a variety of unusual consequences for
superconductivity including: extremely large Pauli limiting fields and residual
Knight shifts for pseudospin singlet superconductors; field induced pair
density wave states; field induced pseudospin singlet to pseudospin triplet
transitions; fully gapped `nodal' superconductors; and additional insight into
the breakdown of Blount's theorem for pseudospin triplet superconductors. We
apply our results to UPt$_3$, BiS$_2$-based superconductors, Fe-based
superconductors, and paramagnetic UCoGe.

Coherent many-body states are highly promising for robust and scalable
quantum information processing. While far-reaching theoretical predictions have
been made for various implementations, direct experimental evidence of their
appealing properties can be challenging. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical
manipulation of the nuclear spin ensemble in the lead halide perovskite
semiconductor FAPbBr$_3$ (FA=formamidinium), targeting a long-postulated
collective dark state that is insensitive to optical pumping. Via optical
orientation of localized hole spins we drive the nuclear many-body system into
an entangled state, requiring a weak magnetic field of only a few Millitesla
strength at cryogenic temperatures. During its fast build-up, the nuclear
polarization along the optical axis remains small, while the transverse nuclear
spin fluctuations are strongly reduced, corresponding to spin squeezing as
evidenced by a strong violation of the generalized nuclear squeezing-inequality
with $\xi_s < 0.3$. The dark state evidenced in this process corresponds to an
approximately 750-body entanglement between the nuclei. Dark nuclear spin
states can be exploited to store quantum information benefiting from their
long-lived many-body coherence and to perform quantum measurements with a
precision beyond the standard limit.

Hydrogen is a promising element for applications in new energy sources like
fuel cells. One key issue for such applications is storing hydrogen. And, to
improve storage capacity, understanding the interaction mechanism between
hydrogen and possible storage materials is critical. This work uses DFT
simulations to comprehensively investigate the adsorption mechanism of H/H$_2$
on the 2D metallic porphyrins with one transition metal in its center. Our
results suggest that the mechanism for adsorption of H (H$_2$) is chemisorption
(physisorption). The maximum adsorption energy for atomic hydrogen was $-3.7$
eV for 2D porphyrins embedded with vanadium or chromium atoms. Our results also
revealed charge transfer of up $-0.43$ e to chemisorbed H atoms. In contrast,
the maximum adsorption energy calculated for molecular hydrogen was $-122.5$
meV for 2D porphyrins embedded with scandium atoms. Furthermore, charge
transfer was minimal for physisorption. Finally, we also determined that
uniaxial strain has a minimal effect on the adsorption properties of 2D
metallic porphyrins.

In comparison to transport of spin polarization in ferromagnets, transport of
electric polarization in ferroelectrics remains less explored. Taking an
excitonic insulator model of electronic ferroelectricity as a prototypical
example, we theoretically investigate the low-energy dynamics and transport of
electric polarization by microscopically constructing the Ginzburg-Landau
action. We show that, because of the scalar nature of the excitonic order
parameter, only the longitudinal fluctuations are relevant to the transport of
electric polarization. We also formulate the electric polarization diffusion
equation, in which the electric-polarization current is defined purely
electronically without recourse to the lattice degrees of freedom.

Recent theoretical investigations of quantum spin liquids have described
phenomenology amenable to experimental observation using scanning tunneling
microscopy. This includes characteristic resonances found at the edge of the
upper Hubbard band of the host Mott insulator, that under certain conditions
shift into the Mott gap under external magnetic field [W.-Y. He and P. A. Lee,
arXiv:2212.08767]. In light of this we report scanning tunneling microscopy
observations, in samples of the quantum spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS2, of a
conductance peak at the upper Hubbard band edge and its magnetic field
dependent behavior. These observations potentially represent evidence for the
existence of a quantum spin liquid in 1T TaS2. We also observe samples in which
such field dependence is absent, but with no observed correlate for the
presence or absence of field dependence. This suggests one or more material
properties controlling electronic behavior that are yet to be understood, and
should help to motivate renewed investigation of the microscopic degrees of
freedom in play in 1T-TaS2, as well as the possible realization of a quantum
spin liquid phase.

Decoherence in superconducting qubits has long been attributed to two level
systems arising from the surfaces and interfaces present in real devices. A
recent significant step in reducing decoherence was the replacement of
superconducting niobium by superconducting tantalum, resulting in a tripling of
transmon qubit lifetimes (T1). One of these surface variables, the identity,
thickness, and quality of the native surface oxide, is thought to play a major
role as tantalum only has one oxide whereas niobium has several. Here we report
the development of a thermodynamic metric to rank materials based on their
potential to form a well-defined, thin, surface oxide. We first compute this
metric for known binary and ternary metal alloys using data available from
Materials Project, and experimentally validate the strengths and limits of this
metric through preparation and controlled oxidation of 8 known metal alloys.
Then we train a convolutional neural network to predict the value of this
metric from atomic composition and atomic properties. This allows us to compute
the metric for materials that are not present in materials project, including a
large selection of known superconductors, and, when combined with Tc, allow us
to identify new candidate superconductors for quantum information science
(QISE) applications. We test the oxidation resistance of a pair of these
predictions experimentally. Our results are expected to lay the foundation for
tailored and rapid selection of improved superconductors for QISE.

We present CoTe2 as a new type-II Dirac semimetal supporting Lorentz symmetry
violating Dirac fermions in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. By combining
first principle ab-initio calculations with experimental angle-resolved
photo-emission spectroscopy results, we show the CoTe2 hosts a pair of type-II
Dirac fermions around 90 meV above the Fermi energy. In addition to the bulk
Dirac fermions, we find several topological band inversions in bulk CoTe2,
which gives rise to a ladder of spin-polarized surface states over a wide range
of energies. In contrast to the surface states which typically display
Rashba-type in-plane spin splitting, we find that CoTe2 hosts novel
out-of-plane spin polarization as well. Our work establishes CoTe2 as a
potential candidate for the exploration of Dirac fermiology and applications in
spintronic devices, infrared plasmonics, and ultrafast optoelectronics.

The failure of heterogeneous materials with microstructures is a complex
process of damage nucleation, growth and localisation. process spans multiple
length scales and is challenging to simulate numerically due to its high
computational cost. One option is to use domain decomposed multi-scale methods
with dynamical refinement. If needed, these methods refine coarse regions into
a fine-scale representation to explicitly model the damage in the
microstructure. However, damage evolution is commonly restricted to fine-scale
regions only. Thus, they are unable to capture the full complexity and breath
of the degradation process in the material. In this contribution, a generic
procedure that allows to account for damage in all representations is proposed.
The approach combines a specially designed damage law, with a scheme to
generate pre-damaged fine-scale microstructures. Results indicate that the
damage approximation for the coarse representation works well. Furthermore, the
generated fine-scale damage patterns are overall consistent with explicitly
simulated damage patterns. Minor discrepancies occur in the generation but
subsequently vanish when explicit damage evolution continuous; for instance
under increased load. The presented approach provides a methodological basis
for adaptive multi-scale simulation schemes with consistent damage evolution.

<br>
<br>
Hybrid magnonics involving coupling between magnons and different quantum
particles have been extensively studied during past few years for varied
interests including quantum electrodynamics. In such systems, magnons in
magnetic materials with high spin density are utilized where the coupling
strength is collectively enhanced by the square root of the number of spins to
overcome the weaker coupling between individual spins and the microwave field.
However, achievement of strong magnon-magnon coupling in a confined nanomagnets
would be essential for on-chip integration of such hybrid systems. Here,
through intensive study of interaction between different magnon modes in a
Ni80Fe20 (Py) nanodot array, we demonstrate that the intermodal coupling can
approach the strong coupling regime with coupling strength up to 0.82 GHz and
cooperativity of 2.51. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the intermodal
coupling is mediated by the exchange field inside each nanodot. The coupling
strength could be continuously tuned by varying the bias field strength and
orientation, opening routes for external control over hybrid magnonic systems.
These findings could greatly enrich the rapidly evolving field of quantum
magnonics.

<h3>Solid-state lithium-ion supercapacitor for voltage control of skyrmions</h3>

Ionic control of magnetism gives rise to high magneto-electric coupling
efficiencies at low voltages, which is essential for low-power magnetism-based
non-conventional computing technologies. However, for on-chip applications,
magneto-ionic devices typically suffer from slow kinetics, poor cyclability,
impractical liquid architectures or strong ambient effects. As a route to
overcoming these problems, we demonstrate an LiPON-based solid-state ionic
supercapacitor with a magnetic Pt/Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$/Pt thin-film
electrode which enables voltage control of a magnetic skyrmion state. Skyrmion
nucleation and annihilation are caused by Li ion accumulation and depletion at
the magnetic interface under an applied voltage. The skyrmion density can be
controlled through dc applied fields or through voltage pulses. The skyrmions
are nucleated by single 60-$\mu$s voltage pulses and devices are cycled 750,000
times without loss of electrical performance. Our results demonstrate a simple
and robust approach to ionic control of magnetism in spin-based devices.

<br>
<br>
We present a neural network (NN) potential based on a new set of atomic
fingerprints built upon two- and three-body contributions that probe distances
and local orientational order respectively. Compared to existing NN potentials,
the atomic fingerprints depend on a small set of tuneable parameters which are
trained together with the neural network weights. To tackle the simultaneous
training of the atomic fingerprint parameters and neural network weights we
adopt an annealing protocol that progressively cycles the learning rate,
significantly improving the accuracy of the NN potential. We test the
performance of the network potential against the mW model of water, which is a
classical three-body potential that well captures the anomalies of the liquid
phase. Trained on just three state points, the NN potential is able to
reproduce the mW model in a very wide range of densities and temperatures, from
negative pressures to several GPa, capturing the transition from an open random
tetrahedral network to a dense interpenetrated network. The NN potential also
reproduces very well properties for which it was not explicitly trained, such
as dynamical properties and the structure of the stable crystalline phases of
mW.

Anyons are particles obeying statistics of neither bosons nor fermions.
Non-Abelian anyons, whose exchanges are described by a non-Abelian group acting
on a set of wave functions, are attracting a great attention because of
possible applications to topological quantum computations. Braiding of
non-Abelian anyons corresponds to quantum computations. The simplest
non-Abelian anyons are Ising anyons which can be realized by Majorana fermions
hosted by vortices or edges of topological superconductors, $\nu =5/2$ quantum
Hall states, spin liquids, and dense quark matter. While Ising anyons are
insufficient for universal quantum computations, Fibonacci anyons present in
$\nu =12/5$ quantum Hall states can be used for universal quantum computations.
Yang-Lee anyons are non-unitary counterparts of Fibonacci anyons. Another
possibility of non-Abelian anyons (of bosonic origin) is given by vortex
anyons, which are constructed from non-Abelian vortices supported by a
non-Abelian first homotopy group, relevant for certain nematic liquid crystals,
superfluid $^3$He, spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, and high density quark
matter. Finally, there is a unique system admitting two types of non-Abelian
anyons, Majorana fermions (Ising anyons) and non-Abelian vortex anyons. That is
$^3P_2$ superfluids (spin-triplet, $p$-wave paring of neutrons), expected to
exist in neutron star interiors as the largest topological quantum matter in
our universe.

<h3>Electric field control of RKKY coupling through solid-state ionics</h3>

Placing a suitable spacer layer between two magnetic layers can lead to an
interaction between the magnetic layers known as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
(RKKY) coupling. Controlling RKKY coupling, particularly the ability to switch
between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling, would enable novel
magnetic data storage devices. By combining solid-state Li ion battery
technology with an out-of-plane magnetized Co/Pt-based stack coupled through a
Ru interlayer we investigate the effects of the insertion of Li ions on the
magnetic properties of the stack. The RKKY coupling and its voltage dependence
is measured as a function of the Ru interlayer thickness, along with the
effects of repeated voltage cycling. The Li ions both change the amplitude of
the RKKY coupling and its phase, leading to the ability to switch the RKKY
coupling between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic with applied voltages.

<h3>A quantum interferometer for quartets in superconducting three-terminal  Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
An interferometric device is proposed in order to analyze the quartet mode in
biased three-terminal Josephson junctions (TTJs), and to provide experimental
evidence for emergence of a single stationary phase, the so-called quartet
phase. In such a quartet-Superconducting Quantum Interference Device
(quartet-SQUID), the flux sensitivity exhibits period $hc/4e$, which is the
fingerprint of a transient intermediate state involving two entangled Cooper
pairs. The quartet-SQUID provides two informations: an amplitude that measures
a total ``quartet critical current'', and a phase lapse coming from the
superposition of the following two current components: the quartet supercurrent
that is odd in the quartet phase, and the phase-sensitive multiple Andreev
reflection (phase-MAR) quasiparticle current, which occurs in transparent
enough TTJs and is even in the quartet phase. Evidence for the latter plays
against conservative scenarii involving synchronization of AC Josephson
currents, based on ``adiabatic'' phase dynamics and RSJ-like models.

<h3>Quantum Fluctuation of the Quantum Geometric Tensor and its  Manifestation as Intrinsic Hall Signatures in Time-Reversal Invariant Systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
In time-reversal invariant systems, all charge Hall effects predicted so far
are extrinsic effects due to the dependence on the relaxation time. We explore
intrinsic Hall signatures by studying quantum noise spectrum of the Hall
current in time-reversal invariant systems, and discover intrinsic thermal Hall
noises in both linear and nonlinear regimes. As the band geometric
characteristics, quantum geometric tensor and Berry curvature play critical
roles in various Hall effects, so are their quantum fluctuations. It is found
that the thermal Hall noise in linear order of the electric field is purely
intrinsic, and the second-order thermal Hall noise has both intrinsic and
extrinsic contributions. In particular, the intrinsic part of the second-order
thermal Hall noise is a manifestation of the quantum fluctuation of quantum
geometric tensor, which widely exists as long as Berry curvature is nonzero.
These intrinsic thermal Hall noises provide direct measurable means to band
geometric information, including Berry curvature related quantities and quantum
fluctuation of quantum geometric tensor.

describing the quasi-relativistic carriers behavior in the

<br>
<br>
Monolayer $MoS_2$ is a typical valleytronic material with valley-spin locked
valence bands. We numerically investigate the valley-spin polarized current in
monolayer $\rm MoS_2$ via adiabatic electron pumping. By introducing an
exchange field to break the energy degeneracy of monolayer $MoS_2$, the top of
its valence bands is valley-spin polarized and tunable by the exchange field. A
device with spin-up polarized left lead, spin-down polarized right lead, and
untuned central region is constructed through applying different exchange
fields in the corresponding regions. Then, equal amount of pumped currents with
opposite valley-spin polarization are simultaneously generated in the left and
right leads when periodically varying two pumping potentials. Numerical results
show that the phase difference between the pumping potentials can change the
direction and hence polarization of the pumped currents. It is found that the
pumped current exhibits resonant behavior in the valley-spin locked energy
window, which depends strongly on the system size and is enhanced to resonant
current peaks at certain system lengths. More importantly, the pumped current
periodically oscillates as a function of the system length, which is closely
related to the oscillation of transmission. The effects of other system
parameters, such as the pumping amplitude and the static potential, are also
thoroughly discussed.

Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, which are produced by the precise
assemblies of varieties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, have demonstrated
many novel properties and functionalities. Here we report a nano-plasmonic
study of vdW heterostructures that were produced by depositing ordered
molecular layers of pentacene on top of graphene. We find through nano-infrared
(IR) imaging that surface plasmons formed due to the collective oscillations of
Dirac fermions in graphene are highly sensitive to the adjacent pentacene
layers. In particular, the plasmon wavelength declines systematically but
nonlinearly with increasing pentacene thickness. Further analysis and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the observed peculiar
thickness dependence is mainly due to the tunneling-type electron transfer from
pentacene to graphene. Our work unveils a new method for tailoring graphene
plasmons and deepens our understanding of the intriguing nano-optical phenomena
due to interlayer couplings in novel vdW heterostructures.

We report a systematic plasmonic study of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) -
two graphene layers stacked with a twist angle. Through real-space nanoimaging
of TBLG single crystals with a wide distribution of twist angles, we find that
TBLG supports confined infrared plasmons that are sensitively dependent on the
twist angle. At small twist angles, TBLG has a plasmon wavelength comparable to
that of single-layer graphene. At larger twist angles, the plasmon wavelength
of TBLG increases significantly with apparently lower damping. Further analysis
and modeling indicate that the observed twist-angle dependence of TBLG plasmons
in the Dirac linear regime is mainly due to the Fermi-velocity renormalization,
a direct consequence of interlayer electronic coupling. Our work unveils the
tailored plasmonic characteristics of TBLG and deepens our understanding of the
intriguing nano-optical physics in novel van der Waals coupled two-dimensional
materials.

Over the past fifteen years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to
realizing topological superconductivity in realistic materials and systems,
predominately propelled by their promising application potentials in
fault-tolerant quantum information processing. In this article, we attempt to
give an overview on some of the main developments in this field, focusing in
particular on two-dimensional crystalline superconductors that possess either
intrinsic p-wave pairing or nontrivial band topology. We first classify the
three different conceptual schemes to achieve topological superconductor (TSC),
enabled by real-space superconducting proximity effect, reciprocal-space
superconducting proximity effect, and intrinsic TSC. Whereas the first scheme
has so far been most extensively explored, the subtle difference between the
other two remains to be fully substantiated. We then move on to candidate
intrinsic or p-wave superconductors, including Sr2RuO4, UTe2, Pb3Bi, and
graphene-based systems. For TSC systems that rely on proximity effects, the
emphases are mainly on the coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial band
topology, as exemplified by transition metal dichalcogenides, cobalt pnictides,
and stanene, all in monolayer or few-layer regime. The review completes with
discussions on the three dominant tuning schemes of strain, gating, and
ferroelectricity in acquiring one or both essential ingredients of the TSC, and
optimizations of such tuning capabilities may prove to be decisive in our drive
towards braiding of Majorana zero modes and demonstration of topological
qubits.

Single electron transistor (SET) is an advanced tool to exploit in quantum
devices. Working of such devices at room-temperature is essential for practical
utilization. Dopant based single-electron devices are well studied at
low-temperature although a few devices are developed for high-temperature
operation with certain limitations. Here, we propose and theoretically exhibit
that nitrogen (N) donor in silicon is an important candidate for effective
designing of such devices. Theoretical calculation of density-of-states using
semi-empirical DFT method indicates that N-donor in silicon has deep ground
state compared to a phosphorus (P) donor. N-donor spectrum is explored in
nano-silicon along with the P-donor. Comparative data of Bohr radius of N-donor
and P-donor is also reported. The simulated current-voltage characteristics
confirm that N-doped device is better suited for SET operation at
room-temperature.

We study theoretically fundamental Coulomb-correlated complexes: neutral and

monolayers. We focus on the situation where one of the electrons occupies
excited, high-lying, conduction band characterized by a negative effective
mass. We develop the theory of such high-lying excitons and trions with
negative effective mass and demonstrate the key role of the non-parabolicity of
the high-lying conduction band dispersion in formation of the bound exciton and
trion states. We present simple, accurate and physically justified trial
wavefunctions for calculating the binding energies of Coulomb-bound complexes
and compare the results of variational calculations with those of a fully
numerical approach. Within the developed model we discuss recent experimental
results on observation of high-lying negative effective mass trions [K.-Q. Lin

The two-dimensional compound group of MXenes, which exhibit unique optical,
electrical, chemical, and mechanical properties, are an exceptional class of
transition metal carbides and nitrides. In addition to traditional applications
in Li-S, Li-ion batteries, conductive electrodes, hydrogen storage, and fuel
cells, the low lattice thermal conductivity coupled with high electron mobility
in the semiconducting oxygen-functionalized MXene-$Ti_2CO_2$ has led to the
recent interests in high-performance thermoelectric and nanoelectronic devices.
Apart from the above dc-transport applications, it is crucial to also
understand ac-transport across them, given the growing interest in applications
surrounding wireless communications and transparent conductors. In this work,
we investigate using our recently developed $ab~initio$ transport model, the
real and imaginary components of electron mobility and conductivity to
conclusively depict carrier transport beyond the room temperature for frequency
ranges upto the terahertz range. We also contrast the carrier mobility and
conductivity with respect to the Drude's model to depict its inaccuracies for a
meaningful comparison with experiments. Our calculations show the effect of
acoustic deformation potential scattering, piezoelectric scattering, and polar
optical phonon scattering mechanisms. Without relying on experimental data, our
model requires inputs calculated from first principles using density functional
theory. Our results set the stage for providing ab-initio based ac-transport
calculations given the current research on MXenes for high frequency
applications.

In recent times, transformer networks have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Here we
present a workflow based on the fine-tuning of BERT models for different
downstream tasks, which results in the automated extraction of structured
information from unstructured natural language in scientific literature.
Contrary to other methods for the automated extraction of structured
compound-property relations from similar sources, our workflow does not rely on
the definition of intricate grammar rules. Hence, it can be adapted to a new
task without requiring extensive implementation efforts and knowledge. We test
the data extraction performance by automatically generating a database of
compounds and their associated Curie temperatures. This is compared with a
manually curated database and one obtained with the state-of-the-art rule-based
method. Finally, in order to demonstrate that the automatically extracted
database can be used in a material-design workflow, we employ it to construct a
machine-learning model predicting the Curie temperature based on a compound's
chemical composition. This is quantitatively tested and compared with the best
model constructed on manually-extracted data.

<h3>Extraordinary-log Universality of Critical Phenomena in Plane Defects</h3>

There is growing evidence that extraordinary-log critical behavior emerges on
the open surfaces of critical systems in a semi-infinite geometry. Here, using
extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we observe extraordinary-log critical
behavior on the plane defects of O(2) critical systems in an infinite geometry.
In this extraordinary-log critical phase, the large-distance two-point
correlation $G$ obeys the logarithmic finite-size scaling $G \sim ({\rm
ln}L)^{-\hat{q}}$ with the linear size $L$, having the critical exponent
$\hat{q}=0.29(2)$. Meanwhile, the helicity modulus $\Upsilon$ follows the
scaling form $\Upsilon \sim \alpha({\rm ln}L)/L$ with the universal parameter
$\alpha=0.56(3)$. The values of $\hat{q}$ and $\alpha$ do not fall into any
known universality class of critical phenomena, yet they conform to the scaling
relation of extraordinary-log universality. We also discuss the extension of

Artificial nanostructures, fabricated by placing building blocks such as
atoms or molecules in well-defined positions, are a powerful platform in which
quantum effects can be studied and exploited on the atomic scale. Here, we
report a strategy to significantly reduce the electron-electron coupling
between a large planar aromatic molecule and the underlying metallic substrate.
To this end, we use the manipulation capabilities of a scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) and lift the molecule into a metastable upright geometry on a
pedestal of two metal atoms. Measurements at millikelvin temperatures and
magnetic fields reveal that the bottom-up assembled standing metal-molecule
nanostructure has an $S = \frac{1}{2}$ spin which is screened by the substrate
electrons, resulting in a Kondo temperature of only $291 \pm 13$ mK. We extract
the Land\'e $g$-factor of the molecule and the exchange coupling $J\rho$ to the
substrate by modeling the differential conductance spectra using a third-order
perturbation theory in the weak coupling and high-field regimes. Furthermore,
we show that the interaction between the STM tip and the molecule can tune the
exchange coupling to the substrate, which suggests that the bond between the
standing metal-molecule nanostructure and the surface is mechanically soft.

We consider the effects of the magnetic field on the frustrated phase states
of the dilute Ising chain, especially, the behavior of the magnetic entropy
change and the isentropic dependence of the temperature on the magnetic field,
which are the key parameters of the magnetocaloric effect. The found
temperature dependences of entropy demonstrate the nonequivalence of frustrated
phases in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases. In the
antiferromagnetic case, the nonzero magnetic field at certain parameters causes
a charge ordering for nonmagnetic impurities at a half-filling, while in the
ferromagnetic case, the magnetic field reduces the frustration of the ground
state only partially. It is also shown, that impurities radically change the
magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter in comparison with the case of a pure Ising
chain.

<h3>Gas Diffusion in Cement Pastes: An Analysis using a Fluctuating  Diffusivity Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11834" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11834</a>
<br>
<i>Fumiaki Nakai, Takato Ishida</i>
<br>
<br>
This work propose an application of the concept of fluctuating diffusivity to
the diffusion of gas molecules in cementitious materials, particularly through
a two-state fluctuating diffusivity (2SFD) model. The 2SFD model is utilized to
investigate the diffusion of oxygen in cement pastes. The analysis provides a
reasonable description of the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in cement pastes,
and highlights the presence of non-Gaussian diffusion, which can be attributed
to the heterogeneous microstructure. The presence of non-Gaussianity in the
probability density of the molecule's displacement, characterized by heavier
tails than those of the Gaussian distribution, may have a significant impact on
the durability assessments of concrete structures.

<br>
<br>
It is shown that the structure of antiphase domain boundaries in the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of a highly anisotropic magnet with S = 1 on a
two-dimensional square lattice depends greatly on single-ion anisotropy
parameter D. Computer modeling on large square lattices illustrates the changes
in the boundary structure from the quantum paramagnet (QP) to the XY phase,
including the intermediate QP-XY phase at fairly small variations in positive
D.

<h3>Morphology and Magnetic vortex chiral symmetry of 2D arrays of magnetic  trilayer disks with magnetostatic interlayer coupling determined by X ray  resonant magnetic scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11851</a>
<br>
<i>J. Díaz, L. M. Álvarez-Prado, S. M. Valvidares, I. Montoya, C. Redondo, R. Morales, M. Vélez</i>
<br>
<br>
X ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) was used to characterize the
magnetization of 2D arrays of trilayer submicron magnets. The interpretation of
the data required the understanding of the morphology of the magnets which was
also deduced from the scattered intensity. The magnets consisted of two
magnetostatically coupled ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic
spacer. The scattered intensity from the disks resulted to be dependent on the
disks surface curvature. This made the collected intensity at each Bragg
reflection (BR) to be correlated to the reflected light from locations of the
disk with the same angle of curvature. Due to this, quantitative information
was obtained, averaged over the disks illuminated by x rays, of the variations
in thickness and magnetization across the entire area of the disks. This
averaged magnetization mapping of the disks served to study their vortex
configuration in each of their magnetic layers, determining the average
location of the vortex, the chiral symmetry of its magnetic circulation, and
the specific locations where the vortex nucleation starts within the disks.
Chiral asymmetry appeared in the disks when the field was oriented at an
oblique angle with respect to the easy axis of the array. The local magnetic
sensitivity of the technique allowed to identify a non-centrosymmetric
distribution of the magnetization of the disks that explains the observed
chiral asymmetry. Unexpectedly, the magnetic circulation sense of the vortex
was the same in both ferromagnetic layers. In addition, the magnetization of
the buried layer was different in the descent branch than in the ascent branch
of its hysteresis loops.

<h3>Competition between the Spin and Pseudospin Subsystems in a Model  Cuprate</h3>

<i>Yu. D. Panov, V. A. Ulitko, K. S. Budrin, D. N. Yasinskaya, A. A. Chikov</i>
<br>
<br>
The competition between the magnetic and charge orderings in a model cuprate
is considered in terms of a simplified static 2D spin-pseudospin model. This
model is equivalent to the 2D dilute antiferromagnetic (AFM) Ising model with
charged impurities. The mean-field approximation results are presented for the
system under study and briefly compared to the classical Monte Carlo (MC)
calculations. The numerical simulation shows that the cases of the strong
exchange and the strong charge correlation differ qualitatively. In the case of
a strong exchange, the AMF phase is instable with respect to the phase
separation (PS) into the pseudospin (charge) and magnetic (spin) subsystems
that behave as immiscible quantum liquids. The analytical expression has been
obtained for the PS temperature.

<h3>Non-Lifshitz invariants corrections to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction  energy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11855</a>
<br>
<i>Doru Sticlet, Frédéric Piéchon</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the continuum limit of two-dimensional chiral magnets in which
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is due to the interplay between a
smooth magnetic texture and spin-orbit coupling. The resulting free energy
density of the system contains linear terms in the spatial gradient of the
magnetic texture, which mark an instability of the system towards the formation
of nontrivial magnetic orders such as skyrmions or chiral domain walls. We
perform a microscopic analysis of DMI tensors responsible for this contribution
to free energy based on a Berry phase formulation in the mixed space of
momentum and position, and reveal that they exhibit non-Lifshitz invariants
features. In particular, a perturbation theory shows in the case of Rashba
spin-orbit interactions the presence of non-Lifshitz invariants to third order
in the small spin-orbit interaction and fourth order in the small exchange
coupling. The higher order terms may even lead to an enhancement of DMI
interaction at strong spin-orbit coupling due to divergences in the density of
states at the bottom of the conduction band. Finally, we also study the DMI
free energy generated from Rashba spin-orbit interaction in different symmetry
groups.

<h3>Electric-field frictional effects in confined zwitterionic brushes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11861" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11861</a>
<br>
<i>Melisa M. Gianetti, Roberto Guerra, Andrea Vanossi, Michael Urbakh, Nicola Manini</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically explore the effect of a transverse electric field on the
frictional response of a bi-layer of packed zwitterionic molecules. The
dipole-moment reorientation promoted by the electric field can lead to either
stick-slip or smooth sliding dynamics, with average shear stress values varying
over a wide range. A structure-property relation is revealed by investigating
the array of molecules and their mutual orientation and interlocking. Moreover,
the thermal friction enhancement previously observed in these brushes is shown
to be suppressed by the electric field, recovering the expected thermolubricity
at large-enough fields. The same holds for other basic tribological quantities,
such as the external load, which can influence friction in opposite ways
depending on the strength of the applied electric field. Our findings open a
route for the reversible control of friction forces via electric polarization
of the sliding surface.

<h3>Observation of brane parity order in programmable optical lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Mott-insulating phase of the two-dimensional (2d) Bose-Hubbard model is
expected to be characterized by a non-local brane parity order. Parity order
captures the presence of microscopic particle-hole fluctuations and
entanglement, whose properties depend on the underlying lattice geometry. We
realize 2d Bose-Hubbard models in dynamically tunable lattice geometries, using
neutral atoms in a novel passively phase-stable tunable optical lattice in
combination with programmable site-blocking potentials. We benchmark the
performance of our system by single-particle quantum walks in the square,
triangular, kagome and Lieb lattice. In the strongly correlated regime, we
microscopically characterize the geometry dependence of the quantum
fluctuations and experimentally validate the brane parity as a proxy for the
non-local order parameter signaling the superfluid-to-Mott insulating phase
transition.

<h3>Fracture properties of La(Fe,Mn,Si)13 magnetocaloric materials</h3>

<i>Siyang Wang, Paul Burdett, Edmund Lovell, Rachel Bettles, Neil Wilson, Mary P. Ryan, Finn Giuliani</i>
<br>
<br>
La(Fe,Mn,Si)13 alloys are a promising material family for magnetic
refrigeration. Challenges associated with their structural integrity during
device assembly and operation requires deep understanding of the mechanical
properties. Here we developed a workflow to quantitatively study the fracture
properties of La(Fe,Mn,Si)13 plates used in magnetic cooling devices. We
employed microstructural characterisation, optical examination of defects, and
four-point bending tests of samples with known defect sizes to evaluate their
mechanical performance. We established the residual strength curve which
directly links observed defects to mechanical strength. The estimated fracture
toughness KC of hydrogenated La(Fe,Mn,Si)13 is approximately 4 MPa m^1/2 for
the geometry employed. The established relationship between strength and crack
length enables the prediction of mechanical performance through examination of
defects via optical microscopy, therefore can be used industrially for
directing plate selection to guarantee the mechanical stability of
refrigeration devices.

<h3>Influence of Local Correlations on the "Homogeneous  Insulator-Superconductor" Transition in the Domain Boundaries of the  Charge-Order Phase of a 2D System of a Mixed Valence</h3>

<br>
<br>
It is demonstrated in the (pseudo)spin S=1 formalism that the structure of
antiphase domain boundaries in the phase of charge ordering of a mixed-valence
system of the Cu1+, 2+, 3+ "triplet" type in cuprates on a two-dimensional
square lattice depends to a considerable extent on on-site correlation
parameter U. The results of computer modeling on large square lattices
illustrate the change in the boundary structure (from a homogeneous monovalent
nonconducting structure of the Cu2+ type to a filamentary superconducting one)
induced by a relatively small variation of positive U values.

<h3>Transforming 2D carbon allotropes into 3D ones through topological  mapping: The case of biphenylene carbon (graphenylene)</h3>

<br>
<i>Raphael M. Tromer, Levi C. Felix, Ray H. Baughmann, Douglas S. Galvao, Cristiano F. Woellner</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we propose a new methodology for obtaining 3D carbon allotrope
structures from 2D ones through topological mapping. The idea is to select a 3D
target structure and 'slice' it along different structural directions, creating
a series of 2D structures. As a proof of concept, we chose the Tubulane
structure 12-hexa(3,3) as a target. Tubulanes are 3D carbon allotropes based on
cross-linked carbon nanotubes. One of obtained 2D 'sliced' structures was
mapped into the biphenylene carbon (BPC). We showed that compressing BPC along
different directions can generate not only the target Tubulane 12-hexa(3,3) but
at least two other structures, bcc-C6 and an unreported member of the Tubulane
family, which we called Tubulane X. The methodology proposed here is completely
general, it can be used coupled with any quantum method. Considering that new
2D carbon allotropes, such as the biphenylene carbon network, which is closely
related to BPC, have been recently synthesized, the approach proposed here
opens new perspectives to obtain new 3D carbon allotropes from 2D structures.

<br>
A two-dimensional (2D) monolayer of a novel ternary nitride Zn2VN3 is
computationally designed, and its dynamical and thermal stability is
demonstrated. A synthesis strategy is proposed based on experimental works on
production of ternary nitride thin films, calculations of formation and
exfoliation energies, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. A
comprehensive characterization of 2D Zn2VN3, including investigation of its
optoelectronic and mechanical properties, is conducted. It is shown that 2D
Zn2VN3 is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 2.75 eV and a high work
function of 5.27 eV. Its light absorption covers visible and ultraviolet
regions. The band gap of 2D Zn2VN3 is found to be well tunable by applied
strain. At the same time 2D Zn2VN3 possesses high stability against mechanical
loads, point defects, and environmental impacts. Considering the unique
properties found for 2D Zn2VN3, it can be used for application in
optoelectronic and straintronic nanodevices.

Nanostructured topological insulators (TIs) have the potential to impact a
wide array of condensed matter physics topics, ranging from Majorana physics to
spintronics. However, the most common TI materials, the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family,
are easily damaged during nanofabrication of devices. In this paper, we show
that electron beam lithography performed with a 30 or 50 kV accelerating
voltage -- common for nanopatterning in academic facilities -- damages both
nonmagnetic TIs and their magnetically-doped counterparts at unacceptable
levels. We additionally demonstrate that electron beam lithography with a 10 kV
accelerating voltage produces minimal damage detectable through low-temperature
electronic transport. Although reduced accelerating voltages present challenges
in creating fine features, we show that with careful choice of processing
parameters, particularly the resist, 100 nm features are reliably achievable.

<h3>Magnomechanical backaction corrections due to coupling to higher order  Walker modes and Kerr nonlinearities</h3>

<br>
<br>
The radiation pressure-like coupling between magnons and phonons in magnets
can modify the phonon frequency (magnomechanical spring effect) and decay rate
(magnomechanical decay) via dynamical backaction. Such effects have been
recently observed by coupling the uniform magnon mode of a magnetic sphere (the
Kittel mode) to a microwave cavity. In particular, the ability to evade
backaction effects was demonstrated [C.A. Potts et al., arXiv:2211.13766
[quant-ph] (2022)], a requisite for applications such as magnomechanical based
thermometry. However, deviations were observed from the predicted
magnomechanical decay rate within the standard theoretical model. In this work,
we account for these deviations by considering corrections due to (i) magnetic
Kerr nonlinearities and (ii) the coupling of phonons to additional magnon
modes. Provided that such additional modes couple weakly to the driven cavity,
our model yields a correction proportional to the average Kittel magnon mode
occupation. We focus our results on magnetic spheres, where we show that the
magnetostatic Walker modes couple to the relevant mechanical modes as
efficiently as the Kittel mode. Our model yields excellent agreement with the
experimental data.
