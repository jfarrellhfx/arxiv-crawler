<h3>Transition between scattering regimes of 2D electron transport</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11353" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11353</a>

</p><i>Philipp Heilmann, Pavlo V. Pyshkin, Bj√∂rn Trauzettel</i>
<p>We examine 2D electron transport through a long narrow channel driven by an
external electric field in presence of diffusive boundary scattering. At zero
temperature, we derive an analytical solution of the transition from ballistic
to diffusive transport if we increase the bulk disorder strength. This
crossover yields characteristic current density profiles. Furthermore, we
illustrate the current density in the transition from ballistic to hydrodynamic
transport. This corresponds to the Gurzhi effect in the resistivity. We also
study the influence of finite temperature on current densities and average
current in this system. In particular, we analyze how different scaling laws of
scattering with respect to temperature affect the current profile along the
channel.

<h3>Investigation of Quasi-particle Relaxation in Strongly Disordered  Superconductor Resonators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10785" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10785</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jie Hu, Jean-Marc Matin, Paul Nicaise, Faouzi Boussaha, Christine Chaumont, Michel Piat, Pham Viet Dung, Piercarlo Bonifacio</i>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the quasi-particle (QP) relaxation of strongly
disordered superconducting resonators under optical illumination at different
bath temperatures with the Rothwarf and Taylor equations and the gap-broadening
theory described by the Usadal equation. The analysis is validated with various
single-photon responses of Titanium Nitride (TiN) microwave kinetic inductance
detectors (MKIDs) under pulsed 405~nm laser illumination. The QP relaxation in
TiN is dominated by QPs with energy below the energy gap smeared by the
disorder, and its duration is still inversely proportional to the QP density.
The QP lifetime versus temperature can be fitted. The relaxation of the
resonator can be further modeled with QP diffusion. The fitted QP diffusion
coefficient of TiN is significantly smaller than expected. Our result also
shows a significant increase in QP generation efficiency as the bath
temperature increases.

<h3>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to  symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ryohei Kobayashi, Taige Wang, Tomohiro Soejima, Roger S. K. Mong, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<p>A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a
symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall
conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher"
versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal
and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract
higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by
evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a
combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result
is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$,
$1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological
entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial
rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order
with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. Even
in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis
type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system.
The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group
symmetry is also presented.

<h3>Nature of excitons and their ligand-mediated delocalization in nickel  dihalide charge-transfer insulators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10818</a>

</p><i>Connor A. Occhialini, Yi Tseng, Hebatalla Elnaggar, Qian Song, Mark Blei, Seth Ariel Tongay, Valentina Bisogni, Frank M. F. de Groot, Jonathan Pelliciari, Riccardo Comin</i>
<p>The fundamental optical excitations of correlated transition-metal compounds
are typically identified with multielectronic transitions localized at the
transition-metal site, such as $dd$ transitions. In this vein, intense interest
has surrounded the appearance of sharp, below band-gap optical transitions,
i.e. excitons, within the magnetic phase of correlated Ni$^{2+}$ van der Waals
magnets. The interplay of magnetic and charge-transfer insulating ground states
in Ni$^{2+}$ systems raises intriguing questions on the roles of long-range
magnetic order and of metal-ligand charge transfer in the exciton nature, which
inspired microscopic descriptions beyond typical $dd$ excitations. Here we
study the impact of charge-transfer and magnetic order on the excitation
spectrum of the nickel dihalides (NiX$_2$, X $=$ Cl, Br, and I) using Ni-$L_3$
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). In all compounds, we detect sharp
excitations, analogous to the recently reported excitons, and assign them to
spin-singlet multiplets of octahedrally-coordinated Ni$^{2+}$ stabilized by
intra-atomic Hund's exchange. Additionally, we demonstrate that these excitons
are dispersive using momentum resolved RIXS. Our data evidence a
ligand-mediated multiplet dispersion, which is tuned by the charge-transfer gap
and independent of the presence of long-range magnetic order. This reveals the
mechanisms governing non-local interactions of on-site $dd$ excitations with
the surrounding crystal/magnetic structure, in analogy to ground state
superexchange. These measurements thus establish the roles of magnetic order,
self-doped ligand holes, and intersite coupling mechanisms for the properties
of $dd$ excitations in charge-transfer insulators.

<h3>Magnetically propagating Hund's exciton in van der Waals antiferromagnet  NiPS3</h3>

<p>Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have opened new frontiers for
realizing novel many-body phenomena. Recently NiPS3 has received intense
interest since it hosts an excitonic quasiparticle whose properties appear to
be intimately linked to the magnetic state of the lattice. Despite extensive
studies, the electronic character, mobility, and magnetic interactions of the
exciton remain unresolved. Here we address these issues by measuring NiPS3 with
ultra-high energy resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We
find that Hund's exchange interactions are primarily responsible for the energy
of formation of the exciton. Measuring the dispersion of the Hund's exciton
reveals that it propagates in a way that is analogous to a double-magnon. We
trace this unique behavior to fundamental similarities between the NiPS3
exciton hopping and spin exchange processes, underlining the unique magnetic
characteristics of this novel quasiparticle.

<h3>Existence of Hebel-Slichter peak in unconventional kagome  superconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10835</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yi Dai, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen</i>
<p>We perform a theoretical investigation of the spin susceptibility of
unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice. Despite the existence
of a sign-changing gap structure, which sums to zero over the Fermi surface, we
show that such unconventional pairing states may exhibit a Hebel-Slichter peak
in the temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation rate. It originates from
destructive sublattice interference effects. For the same reason,
unconventional pairing states on the kagome lattice tend not to exhibit a
neutron resonance peak. These results supplement previous theoretical studies
of the surprising robustness of sign-changing gap structures to disorder on the
kagome lattice. Taken together these findings imply that unconventional
superconductivity on the kagome lattice is deceptive in the sense that its
properties may appear similar to conventional non-sign-changing
superconductivity. These results may be of relevance to the superconducting
state of the kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$: K, Rb, Cs) and
CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$.

<h3>Ligand Induced Size-Dependent Circular Dichroism in Quantum Dots</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10862" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10862</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daniel Chabeda, Stephen Gee, Eran Rabani</i>
<p>Recent experiments have probed the chiral properties of semiconductor
nanocrystal (NC) quantum dots (QDs), but understanding the circular dichroism
lineshape, excitonic features, and ligand induction mechanism remains a
challenge. We propose an atomistic pseudopotential method to model chiral
ligand passivated QDs, computing circular dichroism (CD) spectra for CdSe QDs
(2.6 - 3.8 nm). We find strong agreement between calculated and measured
spectra, predicting consistent bisignate lineshapes with decreasing CD
magnitude as size increases. Our analysis reveals the origin of bisignate
lineshapes, arising from nondegenerate excitons with opposing angular momenta.
We also explore the impact of chiral ligand orientation on QD surfaces,
observing changes in optical activity magnitude and sign. This orientation
sensitivity offers means to distinguish ordered from disordered ligand
configurations, facilitating the study of order-disorder transitions at
ligand-QD interfaces.

<h3>Superior Polymeric Gas Separation Membrane Designed by Explainable Graph  Machine Learning</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10903</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiaxin Xu, Agboola Suleiman, Gang Liu, Michael Perez, Renzheng Zhang, Meng Jiang, Ruilan Guo, Tengfei Luo</i>
<p>Gas separation using polymer membranes promises to dramatically drive down
the energy, carbon, and water intensity of traditional thermally driven
separation, but developing the membrane materials is challenging. Here, we
demonstrate a novel graph machine learning (ML) strategy to guide the
experimental discovery of synthesizable polymer membranes with performances
simultaneously exceeding the empirical upper bounds in multiple industrially
important gas separation tasks. Two predicted candidates are synthesized and
experimentally validated to perform beyond the upper bounds for multiple gas
pairs (O2/N2, H2/CH4, and H2/N2). Notably, the O2/N2 separation selectivity is
1.6-6.7 times higher than existing polymer membranes. The molecular origin of
the high performance is revealed by combining the inherent interpretability of
our ML model, experimental characterization, and molecule-level simulation. Our
study presents a unique explainable ML-experiment combination to tackle
challenging energy material design problems in general, and the discovered
polymers are beneficial for industrial gas separation.

<h3>Strain-dependent Insulating State and Kondo Effect in Epitaxial  SrIrO$_{3}$ Films</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10909</a>
<br>
</p><i>Gaurab Rimal, Tanzila Tasnim, Gabriel Calderon Ortiz, George E. Sterbinsky, Jinwoo Hwang, Ryan B. Comes</i>
<p>The large spin-orbit coupling in iridium oxides plays a significant role in
driving novel physical behaviors, including emergent phenomena in the films and
heterostructures of perovskite and Ruddlesden-Popper iridates. In this work, we
study the role of epitaxial strain on the electronic behavior of thin SrIrO$_3$
films. We find that compressive epitaxial strain leads to metallic transport
behavior, but a slight tensile strain shows gapped behavior.
Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements are used to examine different
behaviors in films as a function of strain. We find Kondo contributions to the
resistivity, with stronger effects in films that are thinner and under less
compressive epitaxial strain. These results show the potential to tune
SrIrO$_3$ into Kondo insulating states and open possibilities for a quantum
critical point that can be controlled with strain in epitaxial films.

<br>
</p><i>Alexander Altland, Tobias Micklitz, Joaquim Telles de Miranda</i>
<p>The evolution of complex correlated quantum systems such as random circuit
networks is governed by the dynamical buildup of both entanglement and entropy.
We here introduce a real-time field theory approach -- essentially a fusion of
the $G \Sigma$-functional of the SYK-model and the field theory of disordered
systems -- enigneered to microscopically describe the full range of such
crossover dynamics: from initial product states to a maximum entropy ergodic
state. To showcase this approach in the simplest nontrivial setting, we
consider a tensor product of coupled random matrices, and compare to exact
diagonalization.

<h3>Self-trapping of active particles induced by non-reciprocal interactions  in disordered media</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10932" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10932</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rodrigo Saavedra, Fernando Peruani</i>
<p>Disordered media is known to modify the transport properties of active matter
depending on interactions between particles and with the substrate. Here we
study systems of active particles with visual-like perception that co-align
with the positions of perceived conspecifics, and anti-align with positions of
static obstacles. We report a novel self-trapping mechanism of particles
forming closed loops that progressively shrink, surrounding one or multiple
obstacles.This mechanism corresponds to a pinning behavior preventing particle
diffusion. Increased co-alignment strength is found to reduce loop shrinking
time, although this effect reaches a plateau at higher strengths. Loops are
found to initially exhibit local polar order, but eventually they transition to
nematic states as they absorb more particles. We show a phase diagram
demonstrating self-trapping occurs within a specific range of aperture angles
of the vision cone.

<h3>Unsupervised machine learning for the detection of exotic phases in  skyrmion phase diagrams</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943</a>
<br>
</p><i>F. A. G√≥mez Albarrac√≠n</i>
<p>Undoubtedly, machine learning techniques are being increasingly applied to a
wide range of situations in the field of condensed matter. Amongst these
techniques, unsupervised techniques are especially attractive, since they imply
the possibility of extracting information from the data without previous
labeling. In this work, we resort to the technique known as anomaly detection
to explore potential exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams, using two
different algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional
Autoencoder (CAE). First, we train these algorithms with an artificial dataset
of skyrmion lattices constructed from an analytical parametrization, for
different magnetizations, skyrmion lattice orientations, and skyrmion radii. We
apply the trained algorithms to a set of snapshots obtained from Monte Carlo
simulations for three ferromagnetic skyrmion models: two with in-plane
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) in the triangular and kagome lattices, and one with
an additional out of plane DMI in the kagome lattice. Then, we compare the root
mean square error (RMSE) and the binary cross entropy between the input and
output snapshots as a function of the external magnetic field and temperature.
We find that the RMSE and its variance in the CAE case may be useful to not
only detect exotic low temperature phases, but also to differentiate between
the characteristic low temperature orderings of a skyrmion phase diagram
(helical, skyrmions and ferromagnetic). Moreover, we apply the skyrmion trained
CAE to two antiferromagnetic models in the triangular lattice, one that gives
rise to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, and the pure exchange antiferromagnetic
case. Despite the predictably larger RMSE, we find that, even in these cases,
RMSE is also an indicator of different orderings and the emergence of
particular features, such as the well-known pseudo-plateau in the pure exchange
case.

<h3>Modulation of the Octahedral Structure and Potential Superconductivity  of La3Ni2O7 at Ambient Pressure by Compressive Strain</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11001" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11001</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zihao Huo, Peng Zhang, Aiqin Yang, Zhengtao Liu, Xiangru Tao, Zihan Zhang, Qiwen Jiang, Wenxuan Chen, Defang Duan, Tian Cui</i>
<p>Superconductivity at Tc = 80 K has recently been reported above 14 GPa in
La3Ni2O7, which thus introduces a new family of high-temperature
superconductors. Using a first-principles calculation with Coulomb repulsion,
we unveil a surprising new route to obtain superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at
ambient pressure by introducing compressive strain along the [001] direction.
The shape of the NiO6 octahedra affect the Ni-3dz2 density of states (DOS) at
Fermi level, and it can be modulated by applying compressive strain instead of
hydrostatic pressure. Notably, when the octahedral regularity parameter defined
herein is R ~ 4%, La3Ni2O7 acquires a high Ni-3dz2 DOS and hole Fermi pocket.
Our study thus indicates a path for obtaining superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at
ambient pressure and elucidates the relationship between structural properties
and superconductivity.

<h3>Non-Hermitian butterfly spectra in a family of quasiperiodic lattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11020" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11020</a>
<br>
</p><i>Li Wang, Zhenbo Wang, Shu Chen</i>
<p>We propose a family of exactly solvable quasiperiodic lattice models with
analytical complex mobility edges, which can incorporate mosaic modulations as
a straightforward generalization. By sweeping a potential tuning parameter
$\delta$, we demonstrate a kind of interesting butterfly-like spectra in
complex energy plane, which depicts energy-dependent extended-localized
transitions sharing a common exact non-Hermitian mobility edge. Applying
Avila's global theory, we are able to analytically calculate the Lyapunov
exponents and determine the mobility edges exactly. For the minimal model
without mosaic modulation, a compactly analytic formula for the complex
mobility edges is obtained, which, together with analytical estimation of the
range of complex energy spectrum, gives the true mobility edge. The
non-Hermitian mobility edge in complex energy plane is further verified by
numerical calculations of fractal dimension and spatial distribution of wave
functions. Tuning parameters of non-Hermitian potentials, we also investigate
the variations of the non-Hermitian mobility edges and the corresponding
butterfly spectra, which exhibit richness of spectrum structures.

<h3>Non-Hermitian zero-energy pinning of Andreev and Majorana bound states  in superconductor-semiconductor systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11026</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jorge Cayao</i>
<p>The emergence of Majorana bound states in finite length
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems has been predicted to occur in the
form of oscillatory energy levels with parity crossings around zero energy.
Each zero-energy crossing is expected to produce a quantized zero-bias
conductance peak but several studies have reported conductance peaks pinned at
zero energy over a range of Zeeman fields, whose origin, however, is not clear.
In this work we consider superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling under
a Zeeman field and demonstrate that non-Hermitian effects, due to coupling to
ferromagnet leads, induce zero-energy pinning of Majorana and trivial Andreev
bound states. We find that this zero-energy pinning effect occurs due to the
formation of non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points,
whose emergence can be controlled by the interplay of non-Hermiticity, the
applied Zeeman field, and chemical potentials. Moreover, depending on the
non-Hermitian spatial profile, we find that non-Hermiticity changes the single
point Hermitian topological phase transition into a flattened zero energy line
bounded by exceptional points from multiple low energy levels. This seemingly
innocent change notably enables a gap closing well below the Hermitian
topological phase transition, which can be in principle simpler to achieve.
Furthermore, we reveal that the energy gap separating Majorana and trivial
Andreev bound states from the quasicontinuum remains robust for the values that
give rise to the zero-energy pinning effect. While reasonable values of
non-Hermiticity can be indeed beneficial, very strong non-Hermitian effects can
be detrimental as it might destroy superconductivity. Our findings can be
therefore useful for understanding the zero-energy pinning of trivial and
topological states in Majorana devices.

<h3>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints for the insulating phases of the  one-dimensional SU($N$) Kondo lattice model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11030" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11030</a>
<br>
</p><i>Philippe Lecheminant, Keisuke Totsuka</i>
<p>The nature of the insulating phases of the SU($N$)-generalization of the
one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is investigated by means of
non-perturbative approaches. By extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM)
argument to multi-component fermion systems with translation and global SU($N$)
symmetries, we derive two indices which depend on the filling and the
``SU($N$)-spin'' (representation) of the local moments. These indices strongly
constrain possible insulating phases; for instance, when the local moments
transform in the $N$-dimensional (defining) representation of SU($N$), a
featureless Kondo insulator is possible only at filling $f= 1-1/N$. To obtain
further insight into the insulating phases suggested by the LSM argument, we
derive low-energy effective theories by adding an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
exchange interaction among the local moments [the SU($N$) Kondo-Heisenberg
model]. A conjectured global phase diagram of the SU($N$) Kondo lattice model
as a function of the filling and the Kondo coupling is then obtained by a
combination of different analytical approaches.

<p>Describing and achieving `unconventional' superconductivity remains a
forefront challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here we use a unitary
mapping, combined with the well-established properties of the attractive
Hubbard model to demonstrate rigorously a Hamiltonian with a low temperature
pair-density-wave (PDW) phase. We also show that the same mapping, when applied
to the widely accepted properties of the repulsive Hubbard model, leads to a
Hamiltonian exhibiting triplet $d$-wave PDW superconductivity and an unusual
combination of ferro- and antiferro-magnetic spin correlations. We then
demonstrate the persistence of the $d$-wave PDW in a Hamiltonian derived from
the mapping of the extended $t$-$J$ model in the large-$U$ limit. Furthermore,
through strategic manipulation of the nearest-neighbor hopping signs of
spin-down electrons, we illustrate the attainability of PDW superconductivity
at other momenta. The intertwining of different magnetic and exotic pairing
correlations noted here may have connections to experimental observations in
spin-triplet candidates like UTe$_2$.

<p>In the last few decades, interference has been extensively studied in both
the quantum and classical fields, which reveals light volatility and is widely

which the discrete diffraction and interference phenomena, presented by the
time-varying voltage of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit model with an
anti-PT symmetry (APT) symmetry. To demonstrate Young's double-slit phenomenon
in an APT circuit, we initially explore the coupled mode theory (CMT) of
voltage in the broken phase, observe discrete diffraction under single
excitation and interference under double excitations. Furthermore, we design a
phase-shifting circuit to observe the effects of phase difference and distance
on discrete interference. Our work combines the effects in optics with
condensed matter physics, show the Young's double-slit phenomenon in electrical
circuits theoretically and experimentally.

<p>The intricate interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in
two-dimensional magnetic materials plays a pivotal role in modifying their
magnetic characteristics, engendering hybrid quasiparticles, and implementing
functional devices. Herein, we present our comprehensive and in-depth
investigations on magnetic and lattice excitations of MnPSe3-xSx (x = 0, 0.5,
and 1.5) alloys, utilizing temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman
scattering. Our experimental results reveal the occurrence of multiple phase
transitions, evidenced by notable changes in phonon self-energy and the
appearance or splitting of phonon modes. These emergent phases are tied to the
development of long and short-range spin-spin correlations, as well as to spin
reorientations or magnetic instabilities. Our analysis of two-magnon
excitations as a function of temperature and composition showcases their
hybridization with phonons whose degree weakens with increasing x. Moreover,
the suppression of spin-dependent phonon intensity in chemically
most-disordered MnPSe3-xSx (x = 1.5) suggests that chalcogen substitution
offers a control knob of tuning spin and phonon dynamics by modulating
concurrently superexchange pathways and a degree of trigonal distortions.

<p>By measuring magnetizations of pristine and Ta-doped CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ single
crystals, we have carried out systematic studies on the lower critical field,
critical current density, and equilibrium magnetization of this kagome system.
The lower critical field has been investigated in the two typical samples, and
the temperature dependent lower critical field obtained in Ta-doped sample can
be fitted by using the model with two $s$-wave superconducting gaps yielding
the larger gap of $2\Delta_{s1}/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{c}=7.9\;(\pm1.8)$. This
indicates a strong-coupling feature of the V-based superconductors. The
measured magnetization hysteresis loops allow us to calculate the critical
current density, which shows a very weak bulk vortex pinning. The magnetization
hysteresis loops measured in these two kinds of samples can be well described
by a recently proposed generalized phenomenological model, which leads to the
determination of many fundamental parameters for these superconductors. Our
systematic results and detailed analysis conclude that this V-based kagome
system has features of strong-coupling superconductivity, relatively large
Ginzburg-Landau parameter and weak vortex coupling.

<p>There is a common belief that superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW)
order accommodate homogenously in real space but compete with each other for
the effective density of states in momentum space in CDW superconductors. By
measuring resistivity along the $c$-axis in
Cs(V$_{1-x}$Ta$_{x}$)$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, we observe strong superconducting
fluctuation behavior coexisting with the CDW order in the pristine
CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, and the fluctuation region becomes narrowed when the Ta
doping suppresses the CDW order. The onset transition temperature barely
changes with the Ta doping. Therefore, the bulk superconductivity may be
established by a doping-independent local pairing, and it can be suppressed in
some regions by the spatially variable CDW order along the $c$-axis. Our
results violate the above-mentioned belief about CDW superconductors and
demonstrate the intricate interaction between superconductivity and CDW order
in this kagome superconductor.

<h3>Multiple charge-density-wave gaps in LaSbTe and CeSbTe as revealed by  ultrafast spectroscopy</h3>

</p><i>Liye Cao, Cuiwei Zhang, Yi Yang, Lei Wang, BiXia Gao, Xinbo Wang, Youguo Shi, Rongyan Chen</i>
<p>Utilizing ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements, we
investigate the photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics of the topological
materials LaSbTe and CeSbTe. In LaSbTe, the relaxation of quasiparticles is
dominated by two different mechanisms: electron-phonon coupling, and
phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination. Significantly, the amplitude of
photoinduced reflectivity related to the former one shows two pronounced peaks
at 156 K and 263 K, indicating the occurrence of two charge density wave (CDW)
phase transitions. The ultrafast responses of CeSbTe share a lot of
similarities with LaSbTe, and an additional CDW phase transition at 154 K is
revealed in CeSbTe. However, the slower relaxation of CeSbTe exhibits an exotic
behavior that deviates from the typical phonon-assisted electron-hole
recombination process, probably due to the imbalance between the electron- and
hole-type carriers. Unlike LaSbTe, the relaxation times of CeSbTe vary slightly
with the pump power, inferring the possible participation of 4$f$ electron in
the decay process. In addition, two oscillation modes around 1 THz and 3 THz
are identified in both LaSbTe and CeSbTe, which are mostly likely to be
coherent phonon modes. These findings unravel the existence of multiple CDW
orders in LaSbTe and CeSbTe, offering insights into the underlying physics of
these systems.

<h3>Self-Ordered Supersolid in Spinor Condensates with Cavity-Mediated  Spin-Momentum-Mixing Interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11157" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11157</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jingjun You, Su Yi, Yuangang Deng</i>
<p>Ultracold atoms with cavity-mediated long-range interactions offer a
promising platform for investing novel quantum phenomena. Exploiting recent
experimental advancements, we propose an experimental scheme to create
self-ordered supersolid in spin-$1/2$ condensates confined within an optical
cavity. The interplay of cavity and pump fields gives rise to supersolid square
and plane wave phases, comprehensively described by the two-component
Tavis-Cummings model. We show that the self-ordered supersolid phase exhibits
an undamped gapless Goldstone mode over a wide parameter range. This proposal,
achievable with current experimental setups utilizing identical laser
configurations, is in contrast to the realization of checkerboard
supersolidity, which hinges on constructing a $U(1)$ symmetry by utilizing two
${\cal Z}_2$ symmetries with precisely matched atom-cavity coupling in
multimode resonators. By employing the superradiant photon-exchange process, we
realize for the first time cavity-mediated spin-momentum-mixing interactions
between highly correlated spin and momentum modes, analogous to that observed
spin-mixing in spin-1 condensates. Our scheme provides a unique platform for
realizing spin-momentum squeezing and spatially distributed multipartite
entanglement.

<br>
</p><i>Fabi√°n Aguirre-L√≥pez</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with a network
structure. Performing a high connectivity expansion for graphs, we write down a
mean-field dynamical theory that incorporates degree heterogeneity. This allows
us to describe the fixed points of the model in terms of a few simple order
parameters. We extend the analysis even for diverging abundances, using a
mapping to the replicator model. With this we present a unified approach for
both cooperative and competitive systems that display complementary behaviors.
In particular we show the central role of an order parameter called the
critical degree, $g_c$. In the competitive regime $g_c$ serves to distinguish
high degree nodes that are more likely to go extinct, while in the cooperative
regime it has the reverse role, it will determine the low degree nodes that
tend to go relatively extinct.

<p>The crystallographic texture is a key organization feature of many technical
and biological materials. In these materials, especially hierarchically
structured ones, the preferential alignment of the nano constituents is heavily
influencing the macroscopic behaviour of the material. In order to study local
crystallographic texture with both high spatial and angular resolution, we
developed Texture tomography (TexTOM). This approach allows to model the
diffraction data of polycrystalline materials by using the full reciprocal
space of the ensemble of crystals and describe the texture in each voxel via a
orientation distribution function. This means, it provides 3D reconstructions
of the local texture by measuring the probabilities of all crystal
orientations. The TexTOM approach addresses limitations associated with
existing models: It correlates the intensities from several Bragg reflections,
thus reduces ambiguities resulting from symmetry. Further, it yields
quantitative probability distributions of local real space crystal orientations
without further assumptions on the sample structure. Finally, its efficient
mathematical formulation enables reconstructions faster than the time-scale of
the experiment. In this manuscript, we present the mathematical model, the
inversion strategy and its current experimental implementation. We show
characterizations of simulated data as well as experimental data obtained from
a synthetic, inorganic model sample, the silica-witherite biomorph. In
conclusion, Tex-TOM provides a versatile framework to reconstruct 3D
quantitative texture information for polycrystalline samples. In this way, it
opens the door for unprecedented insights into the nanostructural makeup of
natural and technical materials.

<h3>Generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper Models in Optical Superlattices</h3>

<p>Ultracold atoms trapped in optical superlattices provide a simple platform
for realizing the seminal Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model. However, the
periodic modulations on the nearest-neighbour hoppings have been ignored in
this model. In this paper, we find that optical superlattice system actually
can be approximately described by a generalized AAH model in the case of
$V_1\gg V_2$, with periodic modulations on both on-site energies and
nearest-neighbour hoppings, supporting much richer topological properties that
are absent in the standard AAH model. Specifically, by calculating Chern
numbers and topological edge states, we show that the generalized AAH model
possesses multifarious topological phases and topological phase transitions, as
compared to the standard AAH model only supporting a single topological phase.
Our findings can open up more opportunities for using optical superlattices to
study topological and localization physics.

<p>Topological phases of ultracold atoms recently have been intensively studied
both in optical superlattices and Raman lattices. However, the topological
features induced by the interplay between such two lattices remain largely
unexplored. Here, we present an optical Raman superlattice system that
incorporates an optical superlattice and a Raman superlattice. The Raman
superlattice presented here supports tunable dimerized spin-orbit couplings and
staggered on-site spin flips. We find that such system respects a spin-rotation
symmetry and has much richer topological properties. Specifically, we show that
various topological phases could emerge in the optical Raman superlattice, such
as four different chiral topological insulator phases and two different quantum
spin Hall insulator phases, identified by spin winding and spin Chern numbers
respectively. We also demonstrate that the spin-dependent topological
invariants could be directly measured by quench dynamics.

</p><i>David Andrieux</i>
<p>To describe the behavior of Markov models as parameters are varied, I show
how to embed the space of Markov models within a Minkowski space. This
embedding maintains the inherent distance between different instances of the
model. The coordinates of this embedding emerge from the symmetrized
Kullback-Leibler divergence and are expressed in terms of thermodynamic
quantities, organizing the Minkowski space into equilibrium and nonequilibrium
components. With this approach, we can visualize models dynamics and gain a
thermodynamic interpretation of information geometric concepts, even in
far-from-equilibrium scenarios. I illustrate this approach using an
analytically solvable molecular motor model.

<h3>Dynamic Local Symmetry Fluctuations of Electron Density in Halide  Perovskites</h3>

<p>Metal halide perovskites have emerged as an exciting class of materials for
applications in solar energy harvesting, optical devices, catalysis, and other
photophysical applications. Many of the exciting properties of halide
perovskites are tied to their soft, dynamic, and anharmonic lattice. In
particular, the precise coupling between anharmonic lattice dynamics and
electronic fluctuations is not completely understood. To build an understanding
of this coupling, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations supplemented
by the calculation of maximally localized Wannier functions to carry out a
dynamic group theory analysis of local electron density fluctuations and how
these fluctuations are coupled to lattice fluctuations in the model inorganic
halide perovskite CsSnBr3. We detail symmetry-dependent couplings between
vibrational modes, including octahedral tilting. Importantly, we suggest that
the large anharmonicity of some of the vibrational modes in CsSnBr3 result from
electron rotation--nuclear translation coupling, in analogy to
rotation--translation coupling effects in molecular plastic crystals. We also
identify electronic fluctuations in the Cs cation that couple to distortions in
the surrounding Sn-Br cubic coordination environment. We anticipate that our
approach and resulting insights into electronic fluctuations will aid in
further understanding the role of the fluctuating lattice in determining
important physical properties of halide perovskites and beyond.

<p>2D Ruddlesden - Popper perovskites are promising candidates for energy
harvesting applications due to their tunable optical properties and excellent
ambient stability. Moreover, they are solution-processable and compatible with
upscalable manufacturing via various printing techniques. Unfortunately, such
methods often induce large degrees of heterogeneity due to poorly controlled
crystallization. Here, we address this issue by blending the well-known 2D
perovskite (PEA)2PbBr4 with an organic small-molecule, namely C8-BTBT, employed
as an additive with different blending ratios. Using terahertz (THz) absorption
and temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy techniques we
observe that with the C8-BTBT additive the photophysical properties are altered
while the perovskite structure in the film remains unaffected. More precisely,
the inclusion of trace amounts of C8-BTBT in the hybrid films results in defect
passivation at perovskite platelet boundaries and at the surfaces, as indicated
by increased carrier lifetimes and substantially increased photoluminescence
quantum yields (PLQY). This in turn improves the responsivity of photodetectors
using the 2D perovskite as active layer. Our study highlights a straightforward
strategy for fabricating high-quality 2D perovskites via large-area processing
techniques.

<h3>Intermolecular charge transfer enhances the performance of molecular  rectifiers</h3>

<p>Molecular-scale diodes made from self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) could
complement silicon-based technologies with smaller, cheaper, and more versatile
devices. However, advancement of this emerging technology is limited by
insufficient electronic performance exhibited by the molecular current
rectifiers. We overcome this barrier by exploiting the charge-transfer state
that results from co-assembling SAMs of molecules with strong electron donor
and acceptor termini. We obtain a substantial enhancement in current
rectification, which correlates with the degree of charge transfer, as
confirmed by several complementary techniques. These findings provide a
previously unexplored method for manipulating the properties of molecular
electronic devices by exploiting donor/acceptor interactions. They also serve
as a model test platform for the study of doping mechanisms in organic systems.
Our devices have the potential for fast widespread adoption due to their
low-cost processing and self-assembly onto silicon substrates, which could
allow seamless integration with current technologies.

<h3>Perovskite Phase Heterojunction Solar Cells</h3>

</p><i>Ran Ji, Zongbao Zhang, Yvonne J. Hofstetter, Robin Buschbeck, Christian H√§nisch, Fabian Paulus, Yana Vaynzof</i>
<p>Modern photovoltaic devices are often based on a heterojunction structure
where two components with different optoelectronic properties are interfaced.
The properties of each side of the junction can be tuned by either utilizing
different materials (e.g. donor/acceptor) or doping (e.g. PN Si junction) or
even varying their dimensionality (e.g. 3D/2D). In this work we demonstrate the
concept of phase heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells by utilizing two polymorphs
of the same material. We demonstrate the approach by forming
$\gamma$-CsPbI3/$\beta$-CsPbI3 perovskite PHJ solar cells. We find that all of
the photovoltaic parameters of the PHJ device significantly surpass those of
each of the single-phase devices, resulting in a maximum power conversion
efficiency of 20.1%. These improvements originate from the efficient
passivation of the $\beta$-CsPbI3 by the larger bandgap $\gamma$-CsPbI3, the
increase in the built-in potential of the PHJ devices enabled by the energetic
alignment between the two phases and the enhanced absorption of light by the
PHJ structure. The approach demonstrated here offers new possibilities for the
development of photovoltaic devices based on polymorphic materials.

<h3>Negatively enhanced thermopower near a Van Hove singularity in  electron-doped Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>

<p>The layered perovskite Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ serves as a model material of the
two-dimensional (2D) Fermi liquid but also exhibits various emergent phenomena
including the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior under external perturbations such
as uniaxial pressure and chemical substitutions. Here we present the
thermoelectric transport of electron-doped system Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$, in
which a filling-induced Lifshitz transition occurs at the Van Hove singularity
(VHS) point of $y\approx 0.2$. We find that the sign of the low-temperature
thermopower becomes negative only near the VHS point, where the NFL behavior
has been observed in the earlier work. This observation is incompatible with
either a numerical calculation within a constant relaxation-time approximation
or a toy-model calculation for the 2D Lifshitz transition adopting an elastic
carrier scattering. As a promising origin of the observed negatively enhanced
thermopower, we propose a skewed NFL state, in which an inelastic scattering
with a considerable odd-frequency term plays a crucial role to negatively
enhance the thermopower.

<h3>Asymptotic, second-order homogenization of linear elastic beam networks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11316</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yang Ye, Basile Audoly, Claire Lestringant</i>
<p>We propose a general approach to the higher-order homogenization of discrete
elastic networks made up of linear elastic beams or springs in dimension 2 or
3. The network may be nearly (rather than exactly) periodic: its elastic and
geometric properties are allowed to vary slowly in space, in addition to being
periodic at the scale of the unit cell. The reference configuration may be
prestressed. A homogenized strain energy depending on both the macroscopic
strain $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ and its gradient $\nabla
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is obtained by means of a two-scale expansion. The
homogenized energy is asymptotically exact two orders beyond that obtained by
classical homogenization. The homogenization method is implemented in a
symbolic calculation language and applied to various types of networks, such as
a 2D honeycomb, a 2D Kagome lattice, a 3D truss and a 1D pantograph. It is
validated by comparing the predictions of the microscopic displacement to that
obtained by full, discrete simulations. This second-order method remains highly
accurate even when the strain gradient effects are significant, such as near
the lips of a crack tip or in regions where a gradient of pre-strain is
imposed.

<p>Higher-order networks are able to capture the many-body interactions present
in complex systems and to unveil new fundamental phenomena revealing the rich
interplay between topology, geometry, and dynamics. Simplicial complexes are
higher-order networks that encode higher-order topology and dynamics of complex
systems. Specifically, simplicial complexes can sustain topological signals,
i.e., dynamical variables not only defined on nodes of the network but also on
their edges, triangles, and so on. Topological signals can undergo collective
phenomena such as synchronization, however, only some higher-order network
topologies can sustain global synchronization of topological signals. Here we
consider global topological synchronization of topological signals on weighted
simplicial complexes. We demonstrate that topological signals can globally
synchronize on weighted simplicial complexes, even if they are odd-dimensional,
e.g., edge signals, overcoming thus a limitation of the unweighted case. These
results thus demonstrate that weighted simplicial complexes are more
advantageous for observing these collective phenomena than their unweighted
counterpart. In particular, we present two weighted simplicial complexes the
Weighted Triangulated Torus and the Weighted Waffle. We completely characterize
their higher-order spectral properties and we demonstrate that, under suitable
conditions on their weights, they can sustain global synchronization of edge
signals. Our results are interpreted geometrically by showing, among the other
results, that in some cases edge weights can be associated with the lengths of
the sides of curved simplices.

<h3>A numerical approach to levitated superconductors and its application to  a superconducting cylinder in a quadrupole field</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Joachim Hofer</i>
<p>Magnetically levitated superconductors in the Meissner state can be utilized
as micro-mechanical oscillators with large mass, high quality factors and long
coherence times. In previous works analytical solutions for the magnetic field
distribution around a superconducting sphere in a quadrupole field have been
found and used to derive the trap parameters, while non-spherical geometries
have only been investigated in a few idealized cases. However, superconductors
of almost arbitrary shape can be used as levitators in a magnetic trap and, as
the trap's properties depend strongly on the superconductors shape, allow for a
wider parameter regime to be accessed. Finite element models are suitable to
obtain the field distribution around arbitrarily shaped superconductors in
arbitrary fields, but have not yet been used widely in the context of levitated
superconductors. Here we present a simple numerical model for this purpose and
use it to calculate the field distribution around cylindrical superconductors
in a quadrupole field and to evaluate the trap parameters. We find that the
cylindrical shape, compared to spherical levitators, allows for substantially
higher trap frequencies and coupling strengths. This in turn reduces the
demands on vibration isolation and significantly eases the requirements for
feedback cooling to the ground state. The numerical model is provided as
supplemental material and can easily be adapted to various geometries and trap
fields.

<h3>Transition Graphs of Interacting Hysterons: Structure, Design,  Organization and Statistics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11344" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11344</a>
<br>
</p><i>Margot H. Teunisse, Martin van Hecke</i>
<p>Collections of bistable elements called hysterons provide a powerful model to
capture the sequential response and memory effects of frustrated, multistable
media in the athermal, quasistatic limit. While a century of work has
elucidated, in great detail, the properties of ensembles of non-interacting
hysterons - the so-called Preisach model - comparatively little is known about
the behavior and properties of interacting hysterons. Here we discuss a general
framework for interacting hysterons, focussing on the relation between the
design parameters that specify the hysterons and their interactions, and the
resulting transition graphs (t-graphs). We show how the structure of such
t-graphs can be thought of as being composed of a scaffold that is dressed by
(avalanche) transitions selected from finite binary trees. Moreover, we provide
a systematic framework to straightforwardly determine the design inequalities
for a given t-graph, and discuss an effective method to determine if a certain
t-graph topology is realizable by a set of interacting hysterons. Altogether,
our work builds on the Preisach model by generalizing the hysteron-dependent
switching fields to the state-dependent switching fields. As a result, while in
the Preisach model, the main loop identifies the critical hysterons that
trigger a transition, in the case of interacting hysterons, the scaffold
contains this critical information and assumes a central role in determining
permissible transitions. In addition, our work suggests strategies to deal with
the combinatorial explosion of the number and variety of t-graphs for
interacting hysterons. This approach paves the way for a deeper theoretical
understanding of the properties and statistics of t-graphs, and opens a route
to materializing complex pathways, memory effects and embodied computations in
(meta)materials based on interacting hysterons.

<h3>A methodology of quantifying membrane permeability based on returning  probability theory and molecular dynamics simulation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11363</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yuya Matsubara, Ryo Okabe, Ren Masayama, Nozomi Morishita Watanabe, Hiroshi Umakoshi, Kento Kasahara, Nobuyuki Matubayasi</i>
<p>We propose a theoretical approach to estimate the permeability coefficient of
substrates (permeants) for crossing membranes from donor (D) phase to acceptor
(A) phase by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A fundamental aspect
of our approach involves reformulating the returning probability (RP) theory, a
rigorous bimolecular reaction theory, to describe permeation phenomena. This
reformulation relies on the parallelism between permeation and bimolecular
reaction processes. In the present method, the permeability coefficient is
represented in terms of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities for the
reactive (R) phase that exists within the inner region of membranes. One can
evaluate these quantities using multiple MD trajectories starting from phase R.
We apply the RP theory to the permeation of ethanol and methylamine at
different concentrations (infinitely dilute and 1 mol% conditions of
permeants). Under the 1 mol% condition, the present method yields a larger
permeability coefficient for ethanol ($0.12 \pm 0.01 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$) than
for methylamine ($0.069\pm 0.006~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$), while the values of the
permeability coefficient are satisfactorily close to those obtained from the
brute-force MD simulations [$0.18\pm 0.03 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ and $0.052 \pm
0.005 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ for ethanol and methylamine, respectively].
Moreover, upon analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the
permeability, we clarify that a higher concentration dependency of permeability
for ethanol, as compared to methylamine, arises from the sensitive nature of
ethanol's free-energy barrier within the inner region of the membrane against
ethanol concentration.

<h3>Stress analysis of functionally graded hyperelastic variable thickness  rotating annular thin disk: A semi-analytic approach</h3>

</p><i>Ehsan Jebellat, Iman Jebellat</i>
<p>Functionally graded materials (FGMs) represent a promising class of advanced
materials designed with tailored microstructures to achieve optimized
mechanical, thermal, and functional properties across varying gradients. The
strategic integration of distinct materials within functionally graded
materials offers engineers unprecedented control over properties such as
strength, thermal conductivity, and corrosion resistance, enabling innovative
solutions for demanding applications in aerospace, automotive, and biomedical
industries. This study investigates a rotating annular thin disk with variable
thickness composed of incompressible hyperelastic material, made up of
functionally graded properties under large deformations. To elucidate these
phenomena, a power relation is employed to delineate the changes in
cross-sectional geometry m, the material property n, and the angular velocity w
of hyperelastic material. Constants used for hyperelastic material are obtained
from the experimental data. Equations are solved semi-analytically for
different values of m, n, and w, and the values of radial stresses, tangential
stresses, and elongation are calculated and compared for different conditions.
Results show that thickness and FG properties have a significant impact on the
behavior of disk, so that the expected behavior of the disk can be obtained by
an optimal selection of the disks geometry and material properties. By
selecting the optimum values for these variables, the location of maximum
stress can be controlled in large deformations, thereby furnishing significance
advantages in structural design and material selection.

<p>A broad class of systems, including ecological, epidemiological, and
sociological ones, are characterized by populations of individuals assigned to
specific categories, e.g., a chemical species, an opinion or an epidemic state,
that are modeled as compartments. Due to interactions and intrinsic dynamics,
individuals are allowed to change category, leading to concentrations varying
over time with complex behavior, typical of reaction-diffusion systems. While
compartmental modeling provides a powerful framework for studying the dynamics
of such populations and describe the spatiotemporal evolution of a system, it
mostly relies on deterministic mean-field descriptions to deal with systems
with many degrees of freedom. Here, we propose a method to alleviate some of
the limitations of compartmental models by capitalizing on tools originating
from quantum physics to systematically reduce multi-dimensional systems to an
effective one-dimensional representation. Using this reduced system, we are
able to not only investigate the mean-field dynamics and their critical
behavior, but we can additionally study stochastic representations that capture
fundamental features of the system. We demonstrate the validity of our
formalism by studying the critical behavior of models widely adopted to study
epidemic, ecological and economic systems.

</p><i>Roman Krahne, Alexander Schleusener, Mehrdad Faraji, Lin-Han Li, Miao-Ling Lin, Ping-Heng Tan</i>
<p>Two-dimensional metal-halide perovskites are highly versatile for
light-driven applications due to their exceptional variety in material
composition, which can be exploited for tunability of mechanical and
optoelectronic properties. The band edge emission is governed by the exciton
fine structure that is defined by structure and composition of both organic and
inorganic layers. Moreover, electronic and elastic properties are intricately
connected in these materials. Electron-phonon coupling plays a crucial role in
the recombination dynamics. However, the nature of the electron-phonon
coupling, as well as which kind of phonons are involved, is still under debate.
Here we investigate the emission and phonon response from single
two-dimensional lead-iodide microcrystals with angle-resolved polarized
spectroscopy. We find an intricate dependence of the emission polarization with
the vibrational directionality in the materials, which clearly reveals that
several bands of the low-frequency phonons of the inorganic lead-iodide
perovskite lattice play the key role in the band edge emission. Our findings
demonstrate how the emission spectrum and polarization of two-dimensional
layered perovskites can be designed by their material composition, which is
essential for optoelectronic applications, where fine control on the spectral
and structural properties of the light is desired.

<p>Here we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistivity,
and ac magnetic susceptibility in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, with a
hydrostatic pressure up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a
bilayer orthorhombic structure (space group $Amam$) at ambient pressure and a
transformation into a tetragonal phase (space group $I4/mmm$) at a critical
pressure of $\sim$14 GPa. The transport measurements reveal a dome-shaped
superconducting region with a maximum $T_c$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. The
superconductivity is gradually suppressed when applying a higher pressure, but
it can persist up to 90 GPa. Importantly, from our high-pressure $ac$ magnetic
susceptibility measurements, the estimated maximum superconducting volume
fraction is 48$\%$ at 19.4 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of
superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high
pressure. The intimate connection among the superconductivity, the oxygen
content, and the tetragonal structure are discussed.

<p>Symmetry sharing facilitates coherent interfaces which can transition from
periodic to quasiperiodic structures. Motivated by the design and construction
of such systems, we present hexagonal quasiperiodic tilings with a single
edge-length which can be considered as decorations of a periodic lattice. We
introduce these tilings by modifying an existing family of golden-mean trigonal
and hexagonal tilings, and discuss their properties in terms of this wider
family. Then, we show how the vertices of these new systems can be considered
as decorations or sublattice sets of a periodic triangular lattice. We conclude
by simulating a simple Ising model on one of these decorations, and compare
this system to a triangular lattice with random defects.

<h3>Modified mean field ansatz for charged polarons in a Bose-Einstein  condensate</h3>

<p>Ionic Bose polarons are quantum entities emerging from the interaction
between an ion and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), featuring long-ranged
interactions that can compete with the gas healing length. This can result in
strong interparticle correlations and enhancement of gas density around the
ion. One possible approach to describe this complex system with high accuracy
relies on numerical treatment such as the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques.
Nevertheless, it is computationally very expensive and does not easily allow to
study the system dynamics. On the other hand, a mean-field based variational
ansatz in the co-moving frame can capture a sizeable change in the gas density.
We apply it to the case of regularized ion-atom potential and find that it
qualitatively reproduces the full numerical results. In addition, we also study
the system of two pinned ions, focusing on their effective interaction induced
by the bath. This approach seems to be promising for studying transport and
nonequilibrium dynamics of charged (bi)polarons in condensed media.

<h3>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</h3>

<p>The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the
chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland--Zirnbauer
classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and
show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells
agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity
does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in
energy--momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some
$k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it
introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters
the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII.
Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications
are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead
of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the
Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.

<h3>Dynamical Detection of Topological Spectral Density</h3>

<p>Local density of states (LDOS) is emerging as powerful means of exploring
synthetic topological phases. However, the current LDOS detection method
remains rare and merely works for static situations. Here, we introduce a
generic dynamical method to detect both the static and Floquet LDOS, based on
an elegant connection between dynamics of chiral density and local spectral
densities. Moreover, we find that the Floquet LDOS allows to measure out
Floquet quasienergy spectra and identify topological $\pi$ modes. As an
example, we demonstrate that both the static and Floquet higher-order
topological phase can be universally identified via LDOS detection, regardless
of whether the topological corner modes are in energy gaps, bands or continue
energy spectra without bandgaps. Our study opens a new avenue utilizing
dynamics to detect topological spectral densities and provides a universal
approach of identifying static and Floquet topological phases.

<h3>Spin and charge dynamics of doped one-dimensional Mott insulators</h3>

<p>Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) for a newly
discovered doped one-dimensional (1D) Mott insulator
Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ proposed the presence of attractive charge
interactions between neighboring sites if an 1D Hubbard model is employed to
describe the material. On the other hand, long-range repulsive charge
interactions were proposed to be crucial for understanding optical excitations
of undoped 1D Mott insulators. Motivated by these contrasting proposals, we
perform density-matrix renormalization group calculations of the
single-particle spectral function as well as dynamical spin and charge
structure factors for two kinds of extended 1D Hubbard models. The spectral
function for the long-range repulsive model less agrees with the ARPES data as
compared with that for the attractive one. The dynamical spin and charge
structure factors also exhibit contrasting behaviors between the two models:
the attractive model shows less momentum dependence of the integrated weight in
the dynamical spin structure factor and more accumulation of the weight on the
upper edge of particle-hole-type excitation in the dynamical charge structure
factor. These features give a good criterion of an appropriate model for doped
1D Mott insulators, which can be judged by resonant-inelastic x-ray scattering
experiments.

<h3>Anisotropic Nonsaturating Magnetoresistance Observed in HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$:  A Kagome Dirac Semimetal</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Achintya Low, Tushar Kanti Bhowmik, Susanta Ghosh, Thirupathaiah Setti</i>
<p>We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties and electronic band
structure of the kagome Dirac semimetal HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$. Temperature-dependent
electrical resistivity demonstrates various magnetic-transition-driven
anomalies. Notably, a crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance
(MR) is observed at around 150 K. While the linear nonsaturating positive MR in
the low-temperature region is mainly driven by the linear Dirac-like band
dispersions as predicted by the first-principles calculations, the negative MR
observed in the high-temperature region is due to the spin-flop type magnetic
transition. Consistent with anisotropic Fermi surface topology, we observe
anisotropic magnetoresistance at low temperatures. A significant anomalous Hall
effect has been noticed at high temperatures in addition to a switching of the
dominant charge carrier from electron to hole at around 215 K.

<h3>Excitonic circular dichroism in boron-nitrogen clusters decorated  graphene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shneha Biswas, Souren Adhikary, Sudipta Dutta</i>
<p>Within the first principle calculations, we propose a boron and nitrogen
cluster incorporated graphene system for efficient valley polarization. The
broken spatial inversion symmetry results in high Berry curvature at K and K'
valleys of the hexagonal Brillouin zone in this semiconducting system. The
consideration of excitonic quasiparticles within GW approximation along with
their scattering processes within many-body Bethe-Salpeter equation gives rise
to an optical gap of 1.72 eV with an excitonic binding energy of 0.65 eV. Owing
to the negligible intervalley scattering, the electrons in opposite valleys are
selectively excited by left- and right-handed circular polarized lights, as
evident from the oscillator strength calculations. Therefore, this system can
exhibit circular-dichroism valley Hall effect in the presence of the in-plane
electric field. Moreover, such excitonic qubits can be exploited for
information processing.

<p>Solid-state electrolytes mark a significant leap forward in the field of
electrochemical energy storage, offering improved safety and efficiency
compared to conventional liquid electrolytes. Among these, antiperovskite
electrolytes, particularly those based on Li and Na, have emerged as promising
candidates due to their superior ionic conductivity and straightforward
synthesis processes. This study focuses on the amorphous phase of
antiperovskite Na$_3$OCl, assessing its structural properties through a
combination of first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) and machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP) simulations. Our comprehensive analysis spans
models ranging from 135 to 3645 atoms, allowing for a detailed examination of
X-ray and neutron structure factors, total and partial pair correlation
functions, coordination numbers, and structural unit distributions. We
demonstrate the minimal, albeit partially present, size effects on these
structural features and validate the accuracy of the MLIP model in reproducing
the intricate details of the amorphous Na$_3$OCl structure described at the
FPMD level.

<p>Semiconductor integrated circuits operated at cryogenic temperature will play
an essential role in quantum computing architectures. These can offer
equivalent or superior performance to their room-temperature counterparts while
enabling a scaling up of the total number of qubits under control. Silicon
integrated circuits can be operated at a temperature stage of a cryogenic
system where cooling power is sufficient ($\sim$3.5+ K) to allow for analog
signal chain components (e.g. amplifiers and mixers), local signal synthesis,
signal digitization, and control logic. A critical stage in cryo-electronics
development is the characterization of individual transistor devices in a
particular technology node at cryogenic temperatures. This data enables the
creation of a process design kit (PDK) to model devices and simulate integrated
circuits operating well below the minimum standard temperature ranges covered
by foundry-released models (e.g. -55 {\deg}C). Here, an efficient approach to
the characterization of large numbers of components at cryogenic temperature is
reported. We developed a system to perform DC measurements with Kelvin sense of
individual transistors at 4.2 K using integrated on-die multiplexers, enabling
bulk characterization of thousands of devices with no physical change to the
measurement setup.

<p>Dual-emissive nanorods with fluorescence in both, the visible and infrared
range are prepared by a combination of a CdSe-nanocrystal-seeded growth of CdS
nanorods, and a successive partial Cd-to-Pb cation exchange. We show that the
exchange reaction, which involves Pb halides in oleylamine, starts at the tip
of the rods, leading to the formation of CdSe-dot/CdS-rod/PbS-dot nanocrystals
(DRDs). Besides these DRDs, the reaction product also contains shorter nanorods
and spherical quantum dots. Their fraction strongly depend on the amount of
lead halide precursor and the reaction time. The reaction mechanism is
investigated in detail, such that by carefully adjusting the reaction
conditions, it is possible to synthesize DRDs of distinct PbS-dot sizes with
yields over 95%. The resulting DRDs are crystalline and show a
CdSe-fluorescence band in the visible range at 600 nm, and also a fluorescence
band in the NIR at 1440 nm, resulting from the PbS part of the rods.

<h3>Microscopic solutions for vortex clustering in two-band type-1.5  superconductor</h3>

</p><i>Igor Timoshuk, Egor Babaev</i>
<p>It has been proposed that two-band superconductors exhibit a distinct phase
characterized by two correlation lengths, where one is smaller and the other
larger than the magnetic field penetration length. This regime was coined
type-1.5 superconductivity, with a number of unconventional properties, such as
vortex clustering. However a fully microscopic solution for vortex clusters has
remained challenging due to computational complexities beyond quasiclassical
models. In this work, we present numerical solutions obtained in a fully
self-consistent two-band Bogoliubov-de-Gennes model. We show the presence of
discrepant correlation lengths leading to vortex clustering in two-band
superconductors.

<p>Exciton-phonon coupling limits the homogeneous emission linewidth of
nanocrystals. Hence, a full understanding of it is crucial. In this work, we
statistically investigate exciton-phonon coupling by performing single-particle
spectroscopy on Zn$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Se/CdS dot-in-rod nanocrystals at cryogenic
temperatures ($T\approx 10~\rm{K}$). In situ cation exchange enables us to
analyze different band alignments and thereby different charge-carrier
distributions. We find that the relative intensities of the longitudinal
optical S- and Se-type phonon replicas correlate with the charge-carrier
distribution. Our experimental findings are complemented with quantum
mechanical calculations within the effective mass approximation that hint at
the relevance of surface charges.

<p>In this study, we combine the ab initio Migdal-Eliashberg approach with the
intermediate representation for the Green's function, enabling accurate and
efficient calculations of the momentum-dependent superconducting gap function
while fully considering the effect of the Coulomb retardation. Unlike the
conventional scheme that relies on a uniform sampling across Matsubara
frequencies - demanding hundreds to thousands of points - the intermediate
representation works with fewer than 100 sampled Matsubara Green's functions.
The developed methodology is applied to investigate the superconducting
properties of three representative low-temperature elemental metals: aluminum
(Al), lead (Pb), and niobium (Nb). The results demonstrate the power and
reliability of our computational technique to accurately solve the ab initio
anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations even at extremely low temperatures,

<h3>Study of Entropy-Driven Polymorphic Stability for Aspirin Using Accurate  Neural Network Interatomic Potential</h3>

</p><i>Shinnosuke Hattori, Qiang Zhu</i>
<p>In this study, we present a systematic computational investigation to analyze
the long debated crystal stability of two well known aspirin polymorphs,
labeled as Form I and Form II. Specifically, we developed a strategy to collect
training configurations covering diverse interatomic interactions between
representative functional groups in the aspirin crystals. Utilizing a
state-of-the-art neural network interatomic potential (NNIP) model, we
developed an accurate machine learning potential to simulate aspirin crystal
dynamics under finite temperature conditions with $\sim$0.46 kJ/mol/molecule
accuracy. Employing the trained NNIP model, we performed thermodynamic
integration to assess the free energy difference between aspirin Forms I and
II, accounting for the anharmonic effects in a large supercell consisting of
512 molecules. For the first time, our results convincingly demonstrated that
Form I is more stable than Form II at 300 K, ranging from 0.74 to 1.83
kJ/mol/molecule, aligning with the experimental observations. Unlike the
majority of previous simulations based on (quasi)harmonic approximations in a
small super cell, which often found the degenerate energies between aspirin I
and II, our findings underscore the importance of anharmonic effects in
determining polymorphic stability ranking. Furthermore, we proposed the use of
rotational degrees of freedom of methyl and ester/phenyl groups in the aspirin
crystal, as characteristic motions to highlight rotational entropic
contribution that favors the stability of Form I. Beyond the aspirin
polymorphism, we anticipate that such entropy-driven stabilization can be
broadly applicable to many other organic systems and thus our approach,
suggesting our approach holds a great promise for stability studies in small
molecule drug design.

<h3>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</h3>

<br>
</p><i>K. Knakkergaard Nielsen</i>
<p>I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and
triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin
couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in
the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium
hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the
thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and
temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally
induced localization phenomenon [arXiv:2310.11193] to the case, where there is
a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics
depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT /
|J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I
characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find
universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and
triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic
interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the
presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the
triangular lattice.

<h3>Sublinear transport in Kagome metals: Interplay of Dirac cones and Van  Hove singularities</h3>

<p>Kagome metals are known to host Dirac fermions and saddle point Van Hove
singularities near Fermi level. With the minimal two-pocket model (Dirac cone +
Van Hove singularity), we propose a semiclassical theory to explain the
experimentally observed sublinear resistivity in Ni$_3$In and other Kagome
metals. We derive the full semiclassical description of kinetic phenomena using
Boltzmann equation, and demonstrate that internode electron-electron
interaction leads to sublinear in $T$ scaling for both electrical and thermal
transport at low temperatures. At higher temperatures above the Dirac node
chemical potential, thermal and electric current dissipate through distinct
scattering channels, making a ground for Wiedemann-Franz law violation.
