<h3>Optimal sampling of dynamical large deviations in two dimensions via  tensor networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11788" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11788</a>
<br>
<i>Luke Causer, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
We use projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) to calculate the large
deviations (LD) statistics of the dynamical activity of the two dimensional
East model, and the two dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP)
with open boundaries, in lattices of up to 40x40 sites. We show that at
long-times both models have phase transitions between active and inactive
dynamical phases. For the 2D East model we find that this trajectory transition
is of the first-order, while for the SSEP we find indications of a second order
transition. We then show how the PEPS can be used to implement a trajectory
sampling scheme capable of directly accessing rare trajectories. We also
discuss how the methods described here can be extended to study rare events at
finite times.

<h3>Edge and corner superconductivity in a 2D topological model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12059" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12059</a>
<br>

<br>
We consider a two-dimensional generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) model, which is known to possess non-trivial topological sectors in its
phase diagram. The inhomogeneous superconducting phases for the attractive $U$
Hubbard model are studied using BdG mean field theory. In finite lattices with
open boundaries, varying the chemical potential, one obtains phases in which
the local pairing order parameter is much enhanced in the corners, or the
edges, compared to the bulk, giving rise to effectively 0D or 1D
superconducting pairing. At half-filling, with increasing temperature, the
order parameters decrease up to a critical temperature $T_{c,PBC}$ beyond which
the sample enters the normal state for an infinite sample. However, in finite
samples at half filling, a nonzero pairing order subsists in the bulk at higher
temperatures, up to the transition temperature of the corner site,
$T_{c,corner}$, when the hopping amplitude ratio is in a moderate range. This
suggests a non-trivial mixing of bulk and corner superconductivity, whose
mechanism is elucidated here.

<h3>Coulomb-correlated few-electron states in a transmission electron  microscope beam</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12300</a>
<br>
<i>Rudolf Haindl, Armin Feist, Till Domröse, Marcel Möller, Sergey V. Yalunin, Claus Ropers</i>
<br>
We observe Coulomb-correlated electron pair and triple states generated by
femtosecond photoemission from a nanoscale field emitter inside a transmission
electron microscope. Event-based electron spectroscopy allows for spatial and
spectral characterization of the electrons emitted by each laser pulse.
Distinctive energy and momentum correlations of two- and three-electron states
are identified, revealing a strong few-body Coulomb interaction at an energy
scale of about two electronvolts. State-sorted beam caustics show a discrete
increase in virtual source size and longitudinal source shift for few-electron
states, associated with transverse momentum correlations. The pronounced
spatial and spectral characteristics of these electron number states allow for
filtering schemes that control the statistical distribution of the pulse
charge. In this way, the fraction of specific few-electron states can be
actively suppressed or enhanced, facilitating the preparation of highly
non-Poissonian electron beams for microscopy and lithography, including future
schemes in correlated two-electron probing.

<h3>Study of pnictides for photovoltaic applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12458" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12458</a>
<br>
<i>Jayant Kumar, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam</i>
<br>
For the transition into a sustainable mode of energy usage, it is important
to develop photovoltaic materials that exhibit better solar-to-electricity
conversion efficiencies, a direct optimal band gap, and made of non-toxic,
earth abundant elements compared to the state-of-the-art silicon photovoltaics.
Here, we explore the non-redox-active pnictide chemical space, including binary
A$_3$B$_2$, ternary AA'$_2$B$_2$, and quaternary AA'A"B$_2$ compounds (A, A',
A" = Ca, Sr, or Zn; B = N or P), as candidate beyond-Si photovoltaics using
density functional theory calculations. Specifically, we evaluate the ground
state configurations, band gaps, and 0 K thermodynamic stability for all 20
pnictide compositions considered, besides computing the formation energy of
cation vacancies, anion vacancies, and cation anti-sites in a subset of
candidate compounds. Importantly, we identify SrZn$_2$N$_2$, SrZn$_2$P$_2$, and
CaZn$_2$P$_2$ to be promising candidates, exhibiting optimal (1.1-1.5 eV)
hybrid-functional-calculated band gaps, stability at 0 K, and high resistance
to point defects (formation energies $>$1 eV), while other possible candidates
include ZnCa$_2$N$_2$ and ZnSr$_2$N$_2$, which may be susceptible to N-vacancy
formation. We hope that our study will contribute to the practical development
of pnictide semiconductors as beyond-silicon light absorbers.

<h3>Emergence of interparticle friction in attractive colloidal matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12703" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12703</a>
<br>
<i>Berend van der Meer, Taiki Yanagishima, Roel P. A. Dullens</i>
<br>
Interparticle friction plays a governing role in the mechanics of particulate
materials. However, virtually all experimental studies to date rely on
measuring macroscopic responses, and as such it remains largely unknown how
frictional effects emerge at the microscopic level. This is particularly
challenging in systems subject to thermal fluctuations due to the transient
nature of interparticle contacts. Here, we directly relate particle-level
frictional arrest to local coordination in an attractive colloidal model
system. We reveal that the orientational dynamics of particles slows down
exponentially with increasing coordination number due to the emergence of
frictional interactions, the strength of which can be tuned simply by varying
the attraction strength. Using a simple computer simulation model, we uncover
how the interparticle interactions govern the formation of frictional contacts
between particles. Our results establish quantitative relations between
friction, coordination and interparticle interactions. This is a key step
towards using interparticle friction to tune the mechanical properties of
particulate materials.

<h3>Anharmonicity in Thermal Insulators -- An Analysis from First Principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12720" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12720</a>
<br>
<i>Florian Knoop, Thomas A.R. Purcell, Matthias Scheffler, Christian Carbogno</i>
<br>
The anharmonicity of atomic motion limits the thermal conductivity in
crystalline solids. However, a microscopic understanding of the mechanisms
active in strong thermal insulators is lacking. In this letter, we classify 465
experimentally known materials with respect to their anharmonicity and perform
fully anharmonic ab initio Green-Kubo calculations for 58 of them, finding 28
thermal insulators with $\kappa < 10$ W/mK including 6 with ultralow $\kappa
\simeq 1$ W/mK. Our analysis reveals that the underlying strong anharmonic
dynamics is driven by the exploration of meta-stable intrinsic defect
geometries. This is at variance with the frequently applied perturbative
approach, in which the dynamics is assumed to evolve around a single stable
geometry.

<h3>Hilbert space fragmentation and interaction-induced localization in the  extended Fermi-Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11777" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11777</a>
<br>
<i>Philipp Frey, Lucas Hackl, Stephan Rachel</i>
<br>
We study Hilbert space fragmentation in the extended Fermi-Hubbard model with
nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions. Using a generalized spin/mover
picture and saddle point methods, we derive lower bounds for the scaling of the
number of frozen states and for the size of the largest block preserved under
the dynamics. We find fragmentation for strong nearest and next-nearest
neighbor repulsions as well as for the combined case. Our results suggest that
the involvement of next-nearest neighbor repulsions leads to an increased
tendency for localization. We then model the dynamics for larger systems using
Markov simulations to test these findings and unveil in which interaction
regimes the dynamics becomes spatially localized. In particular, we show that
for strong nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions random initial states
will localize provided that the density of initial movers is sufficiently low.

<h3>Superfluid response of an atomically thin, gate-tuned van der Waals  superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11800</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Jarjour, G.M. Ferguson, Brian T. Schaefer, Menyoung Lee, Yen Lee Loh, Nandini Trivedi, Katja C. Nowack</i>
<br>
A growing number of two-dimensional superconductors are being discovered in
the family of layered van der Waals (vdW) materials. Due to small sample
volume, their characterization has been largely limited to electrical transport
measurements. As a consequence, characterization of the diamagnetic response of
the superfluid to an applied magnetic field, a defining property of any
superconductor, has been lacking. Here, we use a local magnetic probe to
directly measure the superfluid response of the tunable, gate-induced
superconducting state in MoS$_2$. We find that the backgate changes the
superconducting transition temperature non-monotonically whereas the superfluid
stiffness at low temperature and the normal state conductivity monotonically
increase with backgate voltage. In some devices, we find direct signatures in
agreement with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, whereas in others
we find a broadened, shallow onset of the superfluid response. We show that the
observed behavior is consistent with disorder playing an important role in
determining the superconducting properties in superconducting MoS$_2$. Our work
demonstrates that magnetic property measurements are within reach for vdW
superconductors and reveals that the superfluid response significantly deviates
from simple BCS-like behavior.

<h3>Incommensurate magnetic ordering in CrB$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11804" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11804</a>
<br>
<i>András Deák, Jerome Jackson, Bendegúz Nyári, László Szunyogh</i>
<br>
Incommensurate magnetism in CrB$_2$ is studied in terms of a spin model based
on density functional theory calculations. Heisenberg exchange interactions
derived from the paramagnetic phase using the disordered local moment theory
show significant differences compared with those resulting from the treatment
of the material as a ferromagnet; of these two methods, the disordered local
moment theory is found to give a significantly more realistic description. We
calculate strongly ferromagnetic interactions between Cr planes but largely
frustrated interactions within Cr planes. Although we find that the ground
state ordering vector is sensitive to exchange interactions over a large number
of neighbour shells, the $q$-vector of the incommensurate spin spiral state is
satisfactorily reproduced by the theory ($0.213$ compared with the known
ordering vector $0.285\times (2\pi)/(a/2)$ along $\Gamma-{\rm K}$). The strong
geometric frustration of the exchange interactions
causes a rather low N\'eel temperature (about 97 K), also in good agreement
with experiment.

<h3>Few-electron correlations after ultrafast photoemission from nanometric  needle tips</h3>

Free electrons are essential in such diverse applications as electron
microscopes, accelerators, and photo-emission spectroscopy. Often, space charge
effects of many electrons are a nuisance. Confined to extremely small
space-time dimensions, even two electrons can interact strongly. In this case,
the Coulomb repulsion can now be highly advantageous, because it leads to
surprisingly powerful electron-electron correlations, as we demonstrate here.
We show that femtosecond laser-emitted electrons from nanometric needle tips
are highly anti-correlated in energy because of dynamic Coulomb repulsion, with
a visibility of $56\,\%$. We extract a mean energy splitting of $3.3\,$eV and a
correlation decay time of $82\,$fs. Importantly, the energy-filtered electrons
display a sub-Poissonian number distribution with a second order correlation
function as small as $g^{(2)} = 0.34$, implying that shot noise-reduced pulsed
electron beams can be realized based on simple energy filtering. Even heralded
electrons could become available for quantum-enhanced electron imaging
protocols. Furthermore, we also reach the strong-field regime of laser-driven
electron emission. We gain deep insights into how the electron correlations of
the different electron classes (direct vs. rescattered) are influenced by the
strong laser fields. Our work levels the field of quantum electron optics, with
direct ramifications for shot noise-reduced and quantum electron imaging as
well as direct measurements of correlated electrons from inside of strongly
correlated matter.

<h3>Villain model with long-range couplings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11810" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11810</a>
<br>

<br>
The nearest-neighbor Villain, or periodic Gaussian, model is a useful tool to
understand the physics of the topological defects of the two-dimensional
nearest-neighbor $XY$ model, as the two models share the same symmetries and
are in the same universality class. The long-range counterpart of the
two-dimensional $XY$ model has been recently shown to exhibit a non-trivial
critical behavior, with a complex phase diagram including a range of values of
the power-law exponent of the couplings decay, $\sigma$, in which there are a
magnetized, a disordered and a critical phase (arXiv:2104.13217). Here we
address the issue of whether the critical behavior of the two-dimensional $XY$
model with long-range couplings can be described by the Villain counterpart of
the model. After introducing a suitable generalization of the Villain model
with long-range couplings, we derive a set of renormalization-group equations
for the vortex-vortex potential, which differs from the one of the long-range
$XY$ model, signaling that the decoupling of spin-waves and topological defects
is no longer justified in this regime. The main results are that for $\sigma<2$
the two models no longer share the same universality class. Remarkably, within
a large region of its phase diagram, the Villain model is found to behave
similarly to the one-dimensional Ising model with $1/r^2$ interactions.

<h3>Effect of solute size and polarizability on the equilibrium of  like-charged macromolecules: interplay between enhanced repulsion and  depletion attraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11818</a>
<br>

The complex internal structure of the solute molecules involved in
biomolecular processes necessitates the characterization of the forces between
charged macromolecules beyond the point-ion description. In this article, we
develop a functional integral theory of like-charged membrane interactions in
liquids composed of structured ions modeled as charged Drude oscillators. The
electrostatic mean-field (MF) regime of the system is characterized by an
integro-differential Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation and a generalized contact
value identity. The approximate analytical and exact numerical evaluation of
these equations indicates that the average solute size and polarizability give
rise to two distinct membrane coupling regimes. In the ideal gas regime of
short intermembrane distances and dilute salt, the finite solute size induces a
twofold enhancement of the PB-level repulsion mediated by point-like ions. At
intermediate separation distances, the short-range enhanced repulsion is
followed by a regime of depletion attraction between the like-charged
membranes. This radical alteration of the intermembrane interactions by the
intramolecular salt structure identifies the solute specificity as a key
ingredient of the thermodynamic stability in colloidal systems.

<h3>Modeling Solution Drying by Moving a Liquid-Vapor Interface: Method and  Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11829</a>
<br>
<i>Yanfei Tang, John E. McLaughlan, Gary S. Grest, Shengfeng Cheng</i>
<br>
A method of simulating the drying process of a soft matter solution with an
implicit solvent model by moving the liquid-vapor interface is applied to
various solution films and droplets. For a solution of a polymer and
nanoparticles, we observe "polymer-on-top" stratification, similar to that
found previously with an explicit solvent model. Furthermore, "polymer-on-top"
is found even when the nanoparticle size is smaller than the radius of gyration
of the polymer chains. For a suspension droplet of a bidisperse mixture of
nanoparticles, we show that core-shell clusters of nanoparticles can be
obtained via the "small-on-outside" stratification mechanism at fast
evaporation rates. "Large-on-outside" stratification and uniform particle
distribution are also observed when the evaporation rate is reduced. Polymeric
particles with various morphologies, including Janus spheres, core-shell
particles, and patchy particles, are produced from drying droplets of polymer
solutions by combining fast evaporation with a controlled interaction between
the polymers and the liquid-vapor interface. Our results validate the
applicability of the moving interface method to a wide range of drying systems.
The limitations of the method are pointed out and cautions are provided to
potential practitioners on cases where the method might fail.

<h3>Strain Induced Indirect-to-Direct Bandgap Transition, Photoluminescence  Enhancement, and Linewidth Reduction in Bilayer MoTe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11835</a>
<br>
<i>Yueyang Yu, Chuan-Ding Dong, Rolf Binder, Stefan Schumacher, Cun-Zheng Ning</i>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials provide an ideal platform for
engineering electronic and optical properties through strain control because of
their extremely high mechanical elasticity and sensitive dependence of material
properties on mechanical strain. In this paper, a combined experimental and
theoretical effort is made to investigate the effects of mechanical strain on
various spectral features of bilayer MoTe2 photoluminescence (PL). We found
that bilayer MoTe2 can be converted from an indirect-to direct-bandgap material
through strain engineering, resulting in a photoluminescence enhancement by a
factor of 2.24. Over 90% of the PL comes from photons emitted by the direct
excitons at the maximum strain applied. Importantly, we show that strain
effects lead to a reduction of the overall linewidth of PL by as much as 36.6%.
We attribute the dramatic decrease of linewidth to a strain-induced complex
interplay among various excitonic varieties such as direct bright excitons,
trions, and indirect excitons. Our experimental results on direct and indirect
exciton emission features are explained by theoretical exciton energies that
are based on first-principle electronic band structure calculations. The
consistent theory-experimental trend shows that the enhancement of PL and the
reduction of linewidth are the consequences of the increasing direct exciton
contribution with the increase of strain. Our results demonstrate that strain
engineering can lead to a PL quality of the bilayer MoTe2 comparable to that of
the monolayer counterpart. The additional benefit of a longer emission
wavelength makes the bilayer MoTe2 more suitable for Silicon-photonics
integration due to the reduced Silicon absorption.

<h3>Excitonic effects in X-ray absorption spectra of fluoride salts and  their surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11845" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11845</a>

<i>Ana Sanz-Matias, Subhayan Roychoudhury, Xuefei Feng, Feipeng Yang, Li Cheng Kao, Kevin R. Zavadil, Jinghua Guo, David Prendergast</i>
<br>
Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can probe the
electrode-electrolyte interface with single-digit nanometer depth resolution
and offers a wealth of insight into the evolution and Coulombic efficiency or
degradation of prototype cells, provided that the spectra can be reliably
interpreted in terms of local oxidation state, atomic coordination, and
electronic structure aboutthe excited atoms. To this end, we explore fluorine
K-edge XAS of mono- (Li, Na, K) and di-valent (Mg, Ca, Zn) fluoride salts from
a theoretical standpoint and discover a surprising level of detailed electronic
structure information about these materials, despite the relatively predictable
oxidation state and ionicity of the fluoride anion and the metal cation.
Utilizing a recently developed many-body approach based on the delta-SCF
method, we calculate the XAS using density functional theory and experimental
spectral profiles are well reproduced, despite some experimental discrepancies
in energy alignment within the literature, which we can correct for in our
simulations. We outline a general methodology to explain shifts in the main XAS
peak energies in terms of a simple exciton model and explain line-shape
differences resulting from mixing of core-excited states with metal d character
(for K and Ca specifically). Given ultimate applications to evolving
interfaces, some understanding of the role of surfaces and their terminations
in defining new spectral features is provided to indicate the sensitivity of
such measurements to changes in interfacial chemistry.

<h3>Effective low-energy models for superconducting impurity systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11868" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11868</a>
<br>
<i>Vladislav Pokorný, Martin Žonda</i>
<br>
We present two complementary methods to calculate the Andreev bound state
energies of a single-level quantum dot connected to superconducting leads
described by the superconducting impurity Anderson model. The first method,
which is based on a mapping to a low-energy model, can be utilized to extract
the Andreev bound state energies from finite-temperature, imaginary-time
quantum Monte Carlo data without the necessity of any analytic continuation
technique. The second method maps the full model on an exactly solvable
superconducting atomic limit with renormalized parameters. As such, it
represents a fast and reliable method for a quick scan of the parameter space.
We demonstrate that after adding a simple band correction this method can
provide predictions for measurable quantities, including the Josephson current,
that are in a solid quantitative agreement with precise results obtained by the
numerical renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo.

<h3>Magnetic Phases of Spatially-Modulated Spin-1 Chains in Rydberg  Excitons: Classical and Quantum Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11881" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11881</a>
<br>
<i>Manas Sajjan, Hadiseh Alaeian, Sabre Kais</i>
<br>
In this work, we study the magnetic phases of a spatially-modulated chain of
spin-1 Rydberg excitons. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)
technique we study various magnetic and topologically nontrivial phases using
both single-particle properties like local magnetization and quantum entropy as
well as many-body ones like pair-wise N\'eel and long-range string
correlations. In particular, we investigate the emergence and robustness of
Haldane phase, a topological phase of anti-ferromagnetic spin-1 chains.
Further, we devise a hybrid quantum algorithm employing Restricted Boltzmann
Machine to simulate the ground state of such a system which shows very good
agreement with the results of exact diagonalization (ED) and DMRG.

<h3>Evidence of Lattice Strain as a Precursor to Superconductivity in  BaPb$_{0.75}$Bi$_{0.25}$O$_3$</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Bharath, Jaskirat Brar, Himanshu Pant, Asif Ali, Sakshi Bansal, Ravi Shankar Singh, R. Bindu</i>
<br>
In this work, we have investigated the precursor effects to superconductivity
in BaPb$_{0.75}$Bi$_{0.25}$O$_3$ using temperature dependent resistivity, x-ray
diffraction technique and photoemission spectroscopy. The present compound
exhibits superconductivity around 11 K ($T_C$). The synthesis procedure adopted
is much simpler as compared to the procedure available in the literature. In
the temperature range (10 K-25 K) i.e. above $T_C$, our results show an
increase in both the orthorhombic and tetragonal strain. The well screened
features observed in Bi and Pb 4$f_{7/2}$ core levels are indicative of the
metallic nature of the sample. The compound exhibits finite intensity at the
Fermi level at 300 K and this intensity decreases with decrease in temperature
and develops into a pseudogap; the energy dependence of the spectral density of
states suggests disordered metallic state. Furthermore, our band structure
calculations reveal that the structural transition upon Pb doping results in
the closing of the band gap at the Fermi level.

<br>
The concept of the chiral gauge field (CGF), originally developed in
theoretical particle physics, has now emerged in condensed matter systems in
materials known as Weyl semimetals. In general, Weyl semimetals emerge from
Dirac semimetals when time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetries are broken.
Recently, it has gained a growing interest to manipulate such topological
states of matter by implementing the CGF by shining light to materials. Here we
have demonstrated the emergence of CGF in a massive 3D Dirac electron system in
the paramagnetic phase of Co3Sn2S2, which exhibits a ferromagnetic Weyl
semimetal phase at low temperatures. We first show theoretically that the
illumination of circularly polarized light implements the CGF in the
paramagnetic state of Co3Sn2S2 and gives rise to a topological Weyl state,
which can be realized only in the nonequilibrium state. Then we demonstrated
that the presence of light-induced CGF through the observation of light-induced
anomalous Hall effect, the behavior of which quantitatively agrees with the
calculation from the Floquet theory. The light-induced AHE manifests the Berry
curvature which becomes nonzero as the bands split due to the light-induced
CGF. Our demonstration paves a new pathway for ultrafast manipulation of
topological phases in 3D Dirac semimetals and for further exploring new quantum
matter phases which can be only achieved by light.

<h3>Magnetic nature of wolframite MgReO$_4$</h3>

<br>
Rhenium oxides belonging to the family $A$ReO$_4$ where $A$ is a metal
cation, exhibit interesting electronic and magnetic properties. In this study
we have utilized the muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) technique to
study the magnetic properties of the MgReO$_4$ compound. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first investigation reported on this interesting
material, that is stabilized in a wolframite crystal structure using a special
high-pressure synthesis technique. Bulk magnetic studies show the onset of an
antiferromagnetic (AF) long range order, or a possible singlet spin state at
$T_{\rm C1}\approx90$~K, with a subtle second high-temperature transition at
$T_{\rm C2}\approx280$~K. Both transitions are also confirmed by heat capacity
($C_p$) measurements. From our $\mu^+$SR measurements, it is clear that the
sample enters an AF order below $T_{\rm C1}=T_{\rm N}\approx85$~K. We find no
evidence of magnetic signal above $T_{\rm N}$, which indicates that $T_{\rm
C2}$ is likely linked to a structural transition. Further, via sensitive zero
field (ZF) $\mu^+$SR measurements we find evidence of a spin reorientation at
$T_{\rm Cant}\approx65$~K. This points towards a transition from a collinear AF
into a canted AF order at low temperature, which is proposed to be driven by

<br>
Based on (i) the Shannon information, (ii) the energy-time quantization
relation, and (iii) the quasi-static information-energy correspondence, a
method for the quantization of information states in systems away from
equilibrium is presented given the distance from equilibrium and the mean
temperature of the environment are known as a function of time. The method is
applied to the case of the expanding universe in order to find the
eigen-informations of long-lived structures that are supported by the universe
and the local environments therein at any given epoch, thus providing a
quantitative basis for the rise of complexity with time that embodies the
cosmic evolution.

<h3>Anomalous collective diffusion of interacting self-propelled particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11995" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11995</a>

<i>Tanmoy Chakraborty, Punyabrata Pradhan</i>
<br>
We characterize collective motion of strongly persistent interacting
self-propelled particles (SPPs) and offer a generic mechanism by using the
characteristics of nonlinear diffusion, that accounts for the early-time
anomalous relaxations observed in such systems. For small tumbling rate $\gamma
\ll 1$, a suitably scaled bulk-diffusion coefficient
$\mathcal{D}(\rho,\gamma)$, as a function of density $\rho$, is found to vary
as a power law in a broad range of density: ${\cal D} \propto \rho^{-\alpha}$,
with exponent $\alpha$ slowly crossing over from $\alpha=2$ at large densities
to $\alpha=0$ at small densities. As a result, the density relaxation is
governed by a nonlinear diffusion equation, exhibiting anomalous
spatio-temporal scaling, which, in certain regimes, is ballistic. We
rationalize these findings through a scaling theory and substantiate our claims
by directly calculating the bulk-diffusion coefficient in two minimal models of
SPPs, for arbitrary density $0 < \rho < 1$ and tumbling rate $\gamma > 0$. We
show that, for $\gamma \ll 1$, the bulk-diffusion coefficient has a scaling
form ${\cal D}(\rho, \gamma) = \gamma^{-2} {\cal F}(\rho/\gamma)$, where the
scaling function ${\cal F}(\psi)$ is analytically calculated for one model and
numerically for the other. Our arguments are rather generic, being independent
of dimensions and microscopic details.

<h3>Towards computer-assisted design of hole spin qubits in quantum dot  devices</h3>

<br>
The design of scalable quantum computers will benefit from predictive models
for qubit performance that consider the design and layout of the qubit devices.
This approach, has recently been adopted for superconducting qubits, but has
received little attention for spin qubits in semiconductors. Here, we employ
models for both the device and the quantum mechanical states in the valence
band to theoretically investigate the properties of hole spin qubits in
laterally gated quantum dots in group-IV materials, which have received
significant recent attention. We find that device design impacts qubit
properties in unexpected ways. First, the presence of optimal operation points
where coherence times are long and qubits can be rapidly manipulated results
not only from gate-voltage-induced changes to the Rashba coefficient, but also
from gate-voltage-induced changes to quantum dot radius in real devices, which
impacts g-factor even when inversion symmetry is preserved (Rashba coupling is
zero). Second, the qubit electric manipulation is substantially higher in the
realistic anharmonic potential, by an order of magnitude in the device design
we consider, compared with a harmonic potential assumption, because the
transverse electric dipole of the qubit depends on electrically mediated
couplings to many excited states. Finally, we show that the rapid electric
drive, compatible with long coherence times, can be achieved in the single-hole
regime, with and without strain. These results establish the need for realistic
description of both the device and the quantum mechanical states to support the
design of spin qubit devices, identify new ways to control hole qubit
properties.

<h3>Temperature-dependent anharmonic phonons in quantum paraelectric  KTaO$_3$ by first principles and machine-learned force fields</h3>

<br>
<i>Luigi Ranalli, Carla Verdi, Lorenzo Monacelli, Matteo Calandra, Georg Kresse, Cesare Franchini</i>
<br>
Understanding collective phenomena in quantum materials from first principles
is a promising route toward engineering materials properties on demand and
designing new functionalities. This work examines the quantum paraelectric
state, an elusive state of matter characterized by the smooth saturation of the
ferroelectric instability at low temperature due to quantum fluctuations
associated with anharmonic phonon effects. The temperature-dependent evolution
of the soft ferroelectric phonon mode in the quantum paraelectric KTaO$_3$ in
the range 0-300 K is modelled by combining density functional theory (DFT)
calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation
assisted by an on-the-fly machine-learned force field. The calculated data show
that including anharmonic terms is essential to stabilize the spurious
imaginary ferroelectric phonon predicted by DFT, in agreement with experiments.
Augmenting the DFT workflow with machine-learned force fields allows for
efficient stochastic sampling of the configurational space using large
supercells in a broad and dense temperature range, inaccessible by conventional
ab initio protocols. This work proposes a robust computational workflow capable
of accounting for collective behaviors involving different degrees of freedom
and occurring at large time/length scales, paving the way for precise modeling
and control of quantum effects in materials.

In this Letter, we present a self-consistent field theory of macroscopic
forces in spatially inhomogeneous flexible chain polyelectrolyte solutions. We
derive an analytical expression for a stress tensor which consists of three
terms: isotropic hydrostatic stress, electrostatic (Maxwell) stress, and stress
rising from conformational entropy of polymer chains -- conformational stress.
We apply our theory to the description of polyelectrolyte solutions confined in
a conductive slit nanopore and observe anomalous behavior of disjoining
pressure and electric differential capacitance.

Molecular machines composed of coupled subsystems transduce free energy
between different external reservoirs, in the process internally transducing
energy and information. While subsystem efficiencies of these molecular
machines have been measured in isolation, less is known about how they behave
in their natural setting when coupled together and acting in concert. Here we
derive upper and lower bounds on the subsystem efficiencies of a bipartite
molecular machine. We demonstrate their utility by estimating the efficiencies
of the $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{o}$ and $\mathrm{F}_1$ subunits of ATP synthase and
that of kinesin pulling a diffusive cargo.

<br>
Dirac semimetals show nontrivial physical properties and can host exotic
quantum states like Weyl semimetals and topological insulators under suitable
external conditions. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) and first-principle calculations, we
demonstrate that Zintl-phase compound SmMg$_2$Bi$_2$ belongs to the close
proximity to a topological Dirac semimetallic state. ARPES results show a
Dirac-like band crossing at the zone-center near the Fermi level ($E_\mathrm
{F}$) which is further confirmed by first-principle calculations. Theoretical
studies also reveal that SmMg$_2$Bi$_2$ belongs to a $Z_2$ topological class
and hosts spin-polarized states around the $E_\mathrm {F}$. Zintl's theory
predicts that the valence state of Sm in this material should be Sm$^{2+}$,
however we detect many Sm-4$f$ multiplet states (flat-bands) whose energy
positions suggest the presence of both Sm$^{2+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$. It is also
evident that these flat-bands and other dispersive states are strongly
hybridized when they cross each other. Due to the presence of Sm$^{3+}$ ions,
the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ shows
Curie-Weiss-like contribution in the low temperature region, in addition to the
Van Vleck-like behaviour expected for the Sm$^{2+}$ ions. The present study
will help in better understanding of the electronic structure, magnetism and
transport properties of related materials.

<h3>Effects of scattering on the field-induced Tc enhancement in thin  superconducting films in a parallel magnetic field</h3>

<i>V. G. Kogan, R. Prozorov</i>
<br>
The problem of a thin superconducting film in a parallel magnetic field,
first discussed in the classical paper by Ginzburg and Landau for temperatures
close to the critical, is revisited with the help of the microscopic BCS theory
for arbitrary temperatures taking pair-breaking and transport scattering into
account. While confirming experimental findings of the $T_c$ enhancement by the
magnetic field, we find that the transport scattering pushes the phase
transition curve to higher fields and higher temperatures for nearly all
practical scattering rates. Still, the $T_c$ enhancement disappears in the
dirty limit. We also consider intriguing changes, such as re-entrant
superconductivity, caused to the phase boundary by pair-breaking magnetic ions
spread on one of the film faces. These features await experimental
verification.

<br>
Rings consisting of chemically-bonded atoms are essential topological motifs
in the structural order of network-forming materials. Here, we propose two
analysis methods based on rings: (1) quantitative characterization of ring
shapes and (2) evaluation of the local structure order around rings. In the
first method, we quantify the geometric shape of a ring using a set of our
proposed indicators, namely, the roundness and roughness, in addition to the
conventional ring size. Our findings reveal that the structure of amorphous
silica consists of distorted rings, some of which resemble polymorphisms in
silica crystals. The second method is based on a spatial correlation function,
which describes three-dimensional atom densities around rings. It allows us to
visualize the anisotropy of the local structure order around rings in amorphous
silica. Furthermore, through a comparative analysis of the amorphous silica
models made with different constraints, we show that the local anisotropy
originates from centrally located rings. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
anisotropy contributes to building the intermediate-range structure order in
the amorphous silica characterized by the first sharp diffraction peaks
observed in diffraction experiments.

<h3>Proximity-induced diversified magnetic states and  electrically-controllable spin polarization in bilayer graphene: Towards  layered spintronics</h3>

<br>
<i>Xuechao Zhai, Yaroslav M. Blanter</i>
<br>
Compared to monolayer graphene, electrons in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene
(BLG) have an additional layer degree of freedom, offering a platform for
developing {\it layered spintronics} with the help of proximity-induced
magnetism. Based on an effective phenomenological model, we systematically
study the effect of this magnetism on the spin-dependent band structure near
the Fermi energy and identify the magnetic phases induced in BLG by proximity
with magnets. We show that spin polarization can develop in BLG due to this
proximity effect. This spin polarization depends strongly on the layer
distribution of magnetism, and can always be controlled by gate voltage which
shifts spin-dependent band edges and modifies the total band gap. We further
show that the band spin polarization can be modified by the proximity-induced
staggered sublattice potential. By taking full advantage of layer-dependent
magnetism in BLG, we propose that spintronic devices such as a spin filter, a
giant magnetoresistence device, and a spin diode can operate under fully
electric control, which is easier than the common magnetic field control.

<h3>Surfactant Induced Catastrophic Collapse of Carbon Black Suspension used  in Flow Battery Application</h3>

Carbon black particles act as electronically conductive additives in the
slurry electrodes used in electrochemical redox flow batteries. Stability and
dispersion of the carbon black particles in a slurry electrode are critical
parameters for its storage and the efficient functioning of the battery.
Modifying the carbon black slurry formulation with the addition of a nonionic
surfactant could potentially impart desired properties such as good particle
dispersion, gravitational stability and flowability imparting better
performance of the flow battery. Matching the typical slurry electrode
formulation, we dispersed carbon black particles in 1 M H$_2$SO$_4$ with volume
fraction $\phi$ = 0.01 to 0.06 and c$_{surf.}$ = 0, 0.05 and 0.1 M. Rheological
investigation reveals that the carbon black suspensions behave like colloidal
gels. Sedimentation kinetics of the process was measured by tracking the height
of the particle bed over time in a cuvette using a custom camera set-up. The
sedimentation dynamics here clearly resembled that of a gel collapse. At short
times we observe fast sedimentation associated with structural collapse of the
gel and at long times very slow sedimentation associated with compaction of the
sediment. Addition of a nonionic surfactant (Triton X-100) to the solvent above
CMC at $\alpha$ (= c$_{surf.}$/c$_{CB}$) $<$ 0.7 improves particle dispersion
and increases gel elasticity. However, for $\alpha >$ 0.7 leads to the
formation of a weaker gel that exhibits 'catastrophic collapse' under gravity
and has a lower viscosity.

<h3>Origin of Immediate Damping of Coherent Oscillations in Photoinduced  Charge Density Wave Transition</h3>

<br>
In stark contrast to the conventional charge density wave (CDW) materials,
the one-dimensional CDW on the In/Si(111) surface exhibits immediate damping of
the CDW oscillation during the photoinduced phase transition. Here, by
successfully reproducing the experimentally observed photoinduced CDW
transition on the In/Si(111) surface by performing real-time time-dependent
density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) simulations, we demonstrate that
photoexcitation promotes valence electrons from Si substrate to empty surface
bands composed primarily of the covalent p-p bonding states of the long In-In
bonds, generating interatomic forces to shorten the long bonds and in turn
drives coherently the structural transition. We illustrate that after the
structural transition, the component of these surface bands occurs a switch
among different covalent In bonds, causing a rotation of the interatomic forces
by about {\pi}/6 and thus quickly damping the oscillations in feature CDW
modes. These findings provide a deeper understanding of photoinduced phase
transitions.

<h3>Commensurate and incommensurate double moiré interference in twisted  trilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12154</a>
<br>
<i>Hai Meng, Zhen Zhan, Shengjun Yuan</i>
<br>
Twisted graphene multi-layers have been recently demonstrated to share
several correlation-driven behaviours with twisted bilayer graphene. In
general, the van Hove singularities (VHSs) can be used as a proxy of the
tendency for correlated behaviours. In this paper, we adopt an atomistic method
by combining tight-binding method with the semi-classical molecular dynamics to
investigate the electronic structures of twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) with
two independent twist angles. The two independent twist angles can lead to the
interference of the moir\'e patterns forming a variety of
commensurate/incommensurate complex supermoir\'e patterns. In particular, the
lattice relaxation, twist angle and angle disorder effects on the VHS are
discussed. We find that the lattice relaxation significantly influence the
position and magnitude of the VHSs. In the supermoir\'e TTG, the moir\'e
interference provides constructive or destructive effects depending on the
relative twist angle. By modulating the two independent twist angles, novel
superstructures, for instance, the Kagome-like lattice, could constructed via
the moir\'e pattern. Moreover, we demonstrate that a slight change in twist
angles (angle disorder) provides a significant suppression of the peak of the
VHSs. Apart from the moir\'e length, the evolution of the VHSs and the LDOS
mapping in real space could be used to identify the twist angles in the
complicated TTG. In practice, our work could provide a guide for exploring the
flat band behaviours in the supermoir\'e TTG experimentally.

<h3>Chiral cavity induced spin selectivity</h3>

<br>
<i>Nguyen Thanh Phuc</i>
<br>
Chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a phenomenon in which electron
spins are polarized as they are transported through chiral molecules, and the
spin polarization depends on the handedness of the chiral molecule. In this
study, we show that spin selectivity can be realized in achiral materials by
coupling electrons to a single mode of a chiral optical cavity. By
investigating spin-dependent electron transport using the nonequilibrium
Green's function approach, the spin polarization in a two-terminal setup is
demonstrated to approach unity if the rate of dephasing is sufficiently small
and the average chemical potential of the two leads is within an appropriate
range of values, which is narrow because of the high frequency of the cavity
mode. To obtain a wider range of energies for a large spin polarization, we
propose to combine the CISS in chiral molecules with the light-matter
interactions. For demonstration, the spin polarization of electrons transported
through a helical molecule strongly coupled to a chiral cavity mode is
evaluated.

<i>Zhi-hua Li</i>
<br>
We study transport and relaxation of spinless fermions with long-range
Coulomb interactions by out of equilibrium dynamics. We find the relaxation is
continuously slowing down with stronger coupling $V$ and there is a transition
in the transport type. For intermediate $V$, the system displays normal
diffusive transport, however the relaxation time is long and scales with $V$ in
power laws. For large $V$, the relaxation time diverges exponentially with
system lengths, featuring a MBL-like phase, while at the same time it supports
subdiffusion transport. We attribute the slow relaxation to possible bound
states, which become slower with increasing $V$.

<h3>Microscopic reversibility and emergent elasticity in ultrastable  granular systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12184" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12184</a>

<i>Yiqiu Zhao, Yuchen Zhao, Dong Wang, Hu Zheng, Bulbul Chakraborty, Joshua E. S. Socolar</i>
<br>
In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. X 12, 031021], we reported experimental
observations of "ultrastable" states in a shear-jammed granular system
subjected to small-amplitude cyclic shear. In such states, all the particle
positions and contact forces are reproduced after each shear cycle so that a
strobed image of the stresses and particle positions appears static. In the
present work, we report further analyses of data from those experiments. We
examine the evolution of contact forces within a cycle after an ultrastable
state is formed, not just the strobed dynamics. We find that there are two
types of contacts: non-persistent contacts that reversibly open and close; and
persistent contacts that never open. We show that the non-persistent contacts
contribute a non-negligible amount to the emergent shear modulus. We also
analyze the spatial correlations of the stress tensor and compare them to the
predictions of a recent theory of the emergent elasticity of granular solids
(VCTG) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 118002, arXiv:2204.11811]. We show that our
experimental results can be fit well by VCTG, assuming the uniaxial symmetry of
the contact networks. The fits reveal that the response of the ultrastable
states to additional applied stress is substantially more isotropic than that
of the original shear-jammed states. Our results provide important insight into
the mechanical properties of frictional granular solids created by shear.

<br>
Natural materials usually consist of isotopic mixtures, for which different
isotopic ratios can lead to distinct material properties such as thermal
conductivity and nucleation process. However, the knowledge of isotopic
interface remains largely unexplored mainly due to the challenges in isotopic
identification and property measurement at an atomic scale. Here, by using
monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission
electron microscope, we reveal momentum-transfer-dependent lattice vibration
behavior at an artificial h-10BN/h-11BN heterostructure with sub-unit-cell
resolution. We find the vibrational energy changes across the isotopic
interface gradually, featuring a wide transition regime, which suggests strong
delocalization of the out-of-plane optical phonons at the interface. In
addition, we identify phonons near the Brillouin zone center have a transition
regime ~3.34 nm (10 atomic layers), whereas phonons at the Brillouin zone
boundary transition in ~1.66 nm (5 atomic layers). We propose that the
isotope-induced charge effect at the interface accounts for the distinct
delocalization behavior. Moreover, intra-atomic layer variation of vibration
energy is also sensitive to the momentum transfer, thus at the interface it
depends on both of momentum transfer and mass change. The revealed lattice
vibration behavior at an isotopic interface provides new insights to understand
the isotopic effects on properties in natural materials.

<h3>Hamiltonian perspective on parquet theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12200" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12200</a>
<br>
<i>Frederick Green, Thomas L. Ainsworth</i>
<br>
Understanding collective phenomena calls for tractable descriptions of
correlations in assemblies of strongly interacting constituents. Capturing the
essence of their self-consistency is central. The parquet theory admits a
maximum level of self-consistency for strictly pairwise many-body correlations.
While perturbatively based, the core of parquet and allied models is a set of
strongly coupled nonlinear integral equations for all-order scattering; tightly
constrained by crossing symmetry, they are nevertheless heuristic. Within a
formalism due to Kraichnan, we present a Hamiltonian analysis of fermionic
parquet's structure. The shape of its constitutive equations follows naturally
from the resulting canonical description. We discuss the affinity between the
derived conserving scattering amplitude and that of standard parquet. Whereas
the Hamiltonian-derived model amplitude is microscopically conserving, it
cannot preserve crossing symmetry. The parquet amplitude and its refinements
preserve crossing symmetry, yet cannot safeguard conservation at any stage.
Which amplitude should be used depends on physics rather than on theoretically
ideal completeness.

<br>
Structure factors obtained from diffraction experiments are one of the most
important quantities for characterizing the electronic and structural
properties of materials. Methods for calculating this quantity from plane-wave
density functional theory (DFT) codes are typically prohibitively expensive to
perform, requiring the electron density to be constructed and evaluated on
dense real-space grids. Making use of the projector functions found in both the
Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotential and projector augmented wave methods, we
implement an approach to calculate structure factors which avoids the use of a
dense grid by separating the rapidly changing contributions to the electron
density and treating them on logarithmic radial grids. This approach is
successfully validated against structure factors obtained from all-electron DFT
and experiments for three prototype systems, allowing structure factors to be
obtained at all-electron accuracy at a fraction of the cost of previous
approaches for plane-wave DFT.

<br>
The multiphoton excitation and high harmonic generation (HHG) processes are
considered using the microscopic quantum theory of nonlinear interaction of

quantum dot (RGQD). The dynamic Hartree-Fock approximation is developed for the
consideration of the quantum dot-laser field nonlinear interaction at the
nonadiabatic multiphoton excitation regime. The many-body Coulomb interaction
is described in the extended Hubbard approximation. By numerical results, we

We generate a specific class of patterns by acting with a discrete symmetry
group of the strip, hence a frieze group, on a collection of seeding shapes. If
these shapes are actual discrete resonators carrying internal resonant modes
and if the physics involved in the coupling of these modes is Galilean
invariant, we demonstrate that all dynamical matrices responsible for the
collective dynamics come from the regular representation of the stabilized
frieze group $C^\ast$-algebra. As a result, the spectral bands of such
dynamical matrices carry a complete set of topological invariants that can be
resolved by the K-theory of this algebra, which is computed here together with
an explicit basis. Based on these computations, we generate complete sets of
topological models for all seven classes of frieze groups and demonstrate how
to use them for topological spectral engineering of metamaterials.

<br>
The creep mechanism in the compression testing of the tungsten carbide with
different grain sizes has been studied. The WC samples with high density
(96.1-99.2%) were obtained by SPS from nano-, submicron, and micron-grade WC
powders. The samples had a coarse-grained (CG) surface layers of ~0.3 mm in
thickness and ultrafine-grained (UFG) central parts consisting of WC with a
small fraction of W2C. The creep tests were conducted in two regimes: (Mode #1)
holding at different temperatures (1300-1375C) at 70 MPa; (Mode #2) tests at
different stresses (50, 70, 90 MPa) at 1325C. Tests in Mode #1 were done to
determine the effective creep activation energy Qcr while tests in Mode #2 - to
determine the coefficient n in the power law creep equation. The increasing of
the fraction of the W2C particles from 1.7 up to 4% was found to result in a
decrease in the Qcr from 17.5 down to 13 kTm. The coefficient n equals to
3.1-3.7. The Qcr in the WC sintered from nanopowders was shown to be 31 kTm.
This value is 1.5-2 times greater than the Qcr in the UFG samples obtained by
SPS from commercial powders. The increased fraction of the W2C formed when
sintering the nanopowders with increased adsorbed oxygen concentration was
suggested to be one of the origins of the increase in the Qcr when testing the
UFG samples. The mechanical removing of the CG layers from the surfaces of the
tungsten carbide sample was shown to result in an accelerated creep,
insufficient decrease in the Qcr and coefficient n to 2.5-2.6. The creep rate
of the samples was suggested to be determined simultaneously by the creep
process in the CG surface layers and the creep process in the UFG central parts
of the samples. The creep rate in the surface CG layers is determined by
intensity of carbon diffusion in the WC crystal lattice while the creep rate in
the UFG central parts - by the intensity of grain boundary diffusion.

BCC transition metals (TMs) exhibit complex temperature and strain-rate
dependent plastic deformation behaviour controlled by individual crystal
lattice defects. Classical empirical and semi-empirical interatomic potentials
have limited capability in modelling defect properties such as the screw
dislocation core structures and Peierls barriers in the BCC structure. Machine
learning (ML) potentials, trained on DFT-based datasets, have shown some
successes in reproducing dislocation core properties. However, in group VB TMs,
the most widely-used DFT functionals produce erroneous shear moduli C44 which
are undesirably transferred to machine-learning interatomic potentials, leaving
current ML approaches unsuitable for this important class of metals and alloys.
Here, we develop two interatomic potentials for BCC vanadium (V) based on (i)
an extension of the partial electron density and screening parameter in the
classical semi-empirical modified embedded-atom method (XMEAM-V) and (ii) a
recent hybrid descriptor in the ML Deep Potential framework (DP-HYB-V). We
describe distinct features in these two disparate approaches, including their
dataset generation, training procedure, weakness and strength in modelling
lattice and defect properties in BCC V. Both XMEAM-V and DP-HYB-V reproduce a
broad range of defect properties relevant to plastic deformation and fracture.
In particular, XMEAM-V reproduces nearly all mechanical and thermodynamic
properties at DFT accuracies and with C44 near experimental value. XMEAM-V also
naturally exhibits the anomalous slip at 77 K widely observed in group VB and
VIB TMs and outperforms all existing, publically available interatomic
potentials for V. The XMEAM thus provides a practical path to developing
accurate and efficient interatomic potentials for nonmagnetic BCC TMs and
possibly multi-principal element TM alloys.

<h3>The Taming of the Screw: Dislocation Cores in BCC Metals and Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12323</a>

<br>
Body-centred cubic (BCC) transition metals tend to be brittle at low
temperatures, posing significant challenges in processing and major concerns
for damage tolerance. The brittleness is largely dictated by the screw
dislocation core; the nature and control of which remain a puzzle after nearly
a century. Here, we introduce a physics-based material index \{chi}, the energy
difference between BCC and face-centred-cubic structures, that guides
manipulation of core properties. The lattice friction and nucleation barrier
have near-linear scaling with \{chi} and the core transforms from
non-degenerate to degenerate when \{chi} drops below a threshold in BCC alloys.
\{chi} is related to solute valence electron concentrations and can be
quantitatively predicted by first-principles calculations, providing a robust
path for design of ductile and tough BCC alloys.

<h3>Crosslinker mobility governs fracture behavior of catch-bonded networks</h3>

<br>
While most chemical bonds weaken under the action of mechanical force (called
slip bond behavior), nature has developed bonds that do the opposite: their
lifetime increases as force is applied. While such catch bonds have been
studied quite extensively at the single molecule level and in adhesive
contacts, recent work has shown that they are also abundantly present as
crosslinkers in the actin cytoskeleton. However, their role and the mechanism
by which they operate in these networks have remained unclear. Here, we present
computer simulations that show how polymer networks crosslinked with either
slip or catch bonds respond to mechanical stress. Our results reveal that catch
bonding may be required to protect dynamic networks against fracture, in
particular for mobile linkers that can diffuse freely after unbinding. While
mobile slip bonds lead to networks that are very weak at high stresses, mobile
catch bonds accumulate in high stress regions and thereby stabilize cracks,
leading to a more ductile fracture behavior. This allows cells to combine
structural adaptivity at low stresses with mechanical stability at high
stresses.

<h3>Ionic modulation at the LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ interface for extreme  high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12390" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12390</a>
<br>

<br>
Due to the coexistence of many emergent phenomena, including 2D
superconductivity and a large Rashba spin-orbit coupling, 5d transition metal
oxides based two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) have been prospected as
one of the potential intrants for modern electronics. However, despite the
lighter electron mass, the mobility of carriers, a key requisite for
high-performance devices, in 5d-oxides devices remains far behind their
3d-oxides analogs. The carriers mobility in these oxides is significantly
hampered by the inevitable presence of defects generated during the growth
process. Here, we report very high mobility ($\sim$ 22650
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) of 5d-2DES confined at the LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$
interface. The high mobility, which is beyond the values observed in
LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ systems in the same
carrier-density range, is achieved using the ionic-liquid gating at room
temperature. We postulate that the ionic-liquid gating affects the oxygen
vacancies and efficiently reduces any disorder at the interface. Investigating
density and mobility in a broad range of back-gate voltage, we reveal that the
mobility follows the power-law $\mu \propto n^{1.2}$, indicating the very high
quality of ionic-liquid-gated LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ devices, consistent with our
postulate. Further, the analysis of the quantum oscillations measured in high
magnetic fields confirms that the high-mobility electrons occupy the electronic
sub-bands emerging from the Ta:5d orbitals of KTaO$_3$.

<h3>In-plane strain tuning multiferroicity in monolayer van der Waals  NiI$_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12392" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12392</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao-sheng Ni, Dao-Xin Yao, Kun Cao</i>
<br>
Multiferroic order with the engineered levels of strain in monolayer
NiI$_{2}$ is explored based on density functional theory calculations and Monte
Carlo simulations. Through the investigation of strain-free monolayer
NiI$_{2}$, we find that the first nearest neighbor and third nearest neighbor
exchange interactions play an essential role in the formation of its magnetic
phase diagrams. The competition of these interactions induces magnetic
frustration, leading to the formation of proper-screw helimagnetic ground
state. We further show that these conclusions drawing from the strain-free
monolayer can be well generalized to the cases within our engineered range of
strains. Notably, our calculations show that with 6% tensile strain on the
$a$-axis and 8% compressive strain on the $b$-axis, the N\'{e}el temperature
$T_N$ can be significantly enhanced to 101 K, about 5 times larger than that of
the strain-free one. The strength of spontaneous electric polarizations can
also be more than doubled under 8% uniform compressive strain on both axis. Our
work suggests that strain is a promising way to tune multiferroic orders in the
monolayer NiI$_{2}$, with the potential to signicantly promote its transition
temperatures and electric polarizations, therefore broaden the prospect of its
applications in spintronics devices.

<h3>Enhanced dispersion in an oscillating array of harmonic traps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12399" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12399</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph M. Barakat, Sho C. Takatori</i>
<br>
Experiment, theory, and simulation are employed to understand the dispersion
of colloidal particles in a periodic array of oscillating harmonic traps
generated by optical tweezers. In the presence of trap oscillation, a
non-monotonic and anisotropic dispersion is observed. Surprisingly, the
stiffest traps produce the largest dispersion at a critical frequency, and the
particles diffuse significantly faster in the direction of oscillation than
those undergoing passive Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland diffusion. Theoretical
predictions for the effective diffusivity of the particles as a function of
trap stiffness and oscillation frequency are developed using generalized Taylor
dispersion theory and Brownian dynamics simulations. Both theory and simulation
demonstrate excellent agreement with the experiments, and reveal a new
``slingshot'' mechanism that predicts a significant enhancement of colloidal
diffusion in dynamic external fields.

<h3>Non-equilibrium dynamics of ultracold lattice bosons inside a cavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12408" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12408</a>
<br>
<i>Huan Wang, Xiayao He, Shuai Li, Hongrong Li, Bo Liu</i>
<br>
We study the non-equilibrium quench dynamics crossing a continuous phase
transition between the charge density wave (CDW) and supersolid (SS) phases of
a bosonic lattice gas with cavity-mediated interactions. When changing the
hopping amplitude in the Hamiltonian as a function of time, we investigate the
scaling behavior of the correlation length and vortex density with respect to
the quench time and find that there is a threshold of the quench rate
separating two distinct scaling regimes. When slowly varying the system below
that threshold, we find a power-law scaling as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism (KZM). While considering fast quench above that threshold, a
deviation from the KZM prediction occurs, manifested by a saturation of the
defect density. We further show that such distinct scaling behaviors during
different dynamic procedures can be understood through comparing the relaxation
time and the quench rate.

<h3>Ergodicity in glass relaxation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12442" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12442</a>
<br>
<i>Li Wan</i>
<br>
We derive an equation for the glass relaxation. In the derivation, the
Zwanzig-Mori projection method is not applied explicitly, which makes our
equation different from the mode coupling theory. Due to the nonlinearity, it
is difficult to solve the equation to get the full behaviors of the glass
relaxation. But we can simplify the equation when time approaches infinity and
obtain the static result analytically. The static result shows that the density
correlation function decays to zero finally, meaning that the glass relaxation
is ergodic. In this study, we also find that the force fluctuation of one
individual particle averaged in the glass is sensitive to the temperature and
is suggested to be a parameter to reflect the structural transition for the
glass relaxation.

<h3>Hybrid nano-domain structures of organic-inorganic perovskites from  molecule-cage coupling effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12445" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12445</a>

<i>Ping Tuo, Lei Li, Xiaoxu Wang, Bo Xu, Jianhui Chen, Zhicheng Zhong, Fu-Zhi Dai</i>
<br>
In hybrid perovskites, the organic molecules and inorganic frameworks exhibit
distinct static and dynamic characteristics. Their coupling will lead to
unprecedented phenomena, which have attracted wide research interests. In this
paper, we employed Deep Potential molecular dynamics (DPMD), a large-scale MD
simulation scheme with DFT accuracy, to study $\mathrm{FA/MAPbI_3}$ hybrid
perovskites. A spontaneous hybrid nano-domain behavior, namely multiple
molecular rotation nano-domains embedded into a single $\mathrm{[PbI_6]^{4-}}$
octahedra rotation domain, was firstly discovered at low temperatures. The
behavior originates from the interplay between the long range order of
molecular rotation and local lattice deformation, and clarifies the puzzling
diffraction patterns of $\mathrm{FAPbI_3}$ at low temperatures. Our work
provides new insights into the structural characteristics and stability of
hybrid perovskite, as well as new ideas for the structural characterization of
organic-inorganic coupled systems.

<br>
2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH) can result in novel functionality
that crucially depends on interfacial structure and disorder. Bubbles at the
vdWH interface can modify the interfacial structure. We probe the dynamics of a
bubble at the interface of a graphene-hBN vdWH by using it as the drumhead of a
NEMS device because nanomechanical devices are exquisite sensors. For drums
with different interfacial bubbles, we measure the evolution of the resonant
frequency and spatial mode shape as a function of electrostatic pulling. We
show that the hysteretic detachment of layers of vdWH is triggered by the
growth of large bubbles. The bubble growth takes place due to the concentration
of stress resembling the initiation of fracture. The small bubbles at the
heterostructure interface do not result in delamination as they are smaller
than a critical fracture length. We provide insight into frictional dynamics
and interfacial fracture of vdWH.

<h3>Accurate ab initio modeling of solid solution strengthening in high  entropy alloys</h3>

<br>
High entropy alloys (HEA) represent a class of materials with promising
properties, such as high strength and ductility, radiation damage tolerance,
etc. At the same time, a combinatorially large variety of compositions and a
complex structure render them quite hard to study using conventional methods.
In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology based on ab
initio calculations within the coherent potential approximation. To make the
methodology predictive, we apply an exchange-correlation correction to the
equation of state and take into account thermal effects on the magnetic state
and the equilibrium volume. The approach shows good agreement with available
experimental data on bulk properties of solid solutions. As a particular case,
the workflow is applied to a series of iron-group HEA to investigate their
solid solution strengthening within a parameter-free model based on the
effective medium representation of an alloy. The results reveal intricate
interactions between alloy components, which we analyze by means of a simple
model of local bonding. Thanks to its computational efficiency, the methodology
can be used as a basis for an adaptive learning workflow for optimal design of
HEA.

<h3>Learned Force Fields Are Ready For Ground State Catalyst Discovery</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12466" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12466</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Schaarschmidt, Morgane Riviere, Alex M. Ganose, James S. Spencer, Alexander L. Gaunt, James Kirkpatrick, Simon Axelrod, Peter W. Battaglia, Jonathan Godwin</i>
<br>
We present evidence that learned density functional theory (``DFT'') force
fields are ready for ground state catalyst discovery. Our key finding is that
relaxation using forces from a learned potential yields structures with similar
or lower energy to those relaxed using the RPBE functional in over 50\% of
evaluated systems, despite the fact that the predicted forces differ
significantly from the ground truth. This has the surprising implication that
learned potentials may be ready for replacing DFT in challenging catalytic
systems such as those found in the Open Catalyst 2020 dataset. Furthermore, we
show that a force field trained on a locally harmonic energy surface with the
same minima as a target DFT energy is also able to find lower or similar energy
structures in over 50\% of cases. This ``Easy Potential'' converges in fewer
steps than a standard model trained on true energies and forces, which further
accelerates calculations. Its success illustrates a key point: learned
potentials can locate energy minima even when the model has high force errors.
The main requirement for structure optimisation is simply that the learned
potential has the correct minima. Since learned potentials are fast and scale
linearly with system size, our results open the possibility of quickly finding
ground states for large systems.

<br>
We present the transfer of the spatially variant polarization of
topologically structured light to the spatial spin texture in a semiconductor
quantum well. The electron spin texture, which is a circular pattern with
repeating spin-up and spin-down states whose repetition rate is determined by
the topological charge, is directly excited by a vector vortex beam with a
spatial helicity structure. The generated spin texture efficiently evolves into
a helical spin wave pattern owing to the spin-orbit effective magnetic fields
in the persistent spin helix state by controlling the spatial wave number of
the excited spin mode. By tuning the repetition length and azimuthal angle, we
simultaneously generate helical spin waves with opposite phases by a single
beam.

<h3>Observation of confinement-induced resonances in a 3D lattice</h3>

<br>
We report on the observation of confinement-induced resonances for strong
three-dimensional (3D) confinement in a lattice potential. Starting from a
Mott-insulator state with predominantly single-site occupancy, we detect loss
and heating features at specific values for the confinement length and the 3D
scattering length. Two independent models, based on the coupling between the
center-of-mass and the relative motion of the particles as mediated by the
lattice, predict the resonance positions to a good approximation, suggesting a
universal behavior. Our results extend confinement-induced resonances to any
dimensionality and open up an alternative method for interaction tuning and
controlled molecule formation under strong 3D confinement.

<h3>Dynamical many-body delocalization transition of a Tonks gas in a  quasi-periodic driving potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12510</a>
<br>
<i>Vincent Vuatelet, Adam Rançon</i>
<br>
The quantum kicked rotor is well-known for displaying dynamical (Anderson)
localization. It has recently been shown that a periodically kicked Tonks gas
will always localize and converge to a finite energy steady-state. This
steady-state has been described as being effectively thermal with an effective
temperature that depends on the parameters of the kick. Here we study a
generalization to a quasi-periodic driving with three frequencies which,
without interactions, has a metal-insulator Anderson transition. We show that a
quasi-periodically kicked Tonks gas goes through a dynamical many-body
delocalization transition when the kick strength is increased. The localized
phase is still described by a low effective temperature, while the delocalized
phase corresponds to an infinite-temperature phase, with the temperature
increasing linearly in time. At the critical point, the momentum distribution
of the Tonks gas displays different scaling at small and large momenta
(contrary to the non-interacting case), signaling a breakdown of the
one-parameter scaling theory of localization.

<h3>Structure and Phase Transitions of Metastable Hexagonal Uranium Thin  Films</h3>

<br>
We report a simple technique for the synthesis of uniaxially textured,
metastable hexagonal close-packed-like uranium thin films with thicknesses
between 175-2800 {\AA}. The initial structure and texture of the layers have
been studied via X-ray diffraction and reflectivity and the time-dependent
transitions of the samples into various orientations of orthorhombic \alpha-U
have been mapped by similar techniques. The final crystallographic orientations
of each system and the timescales on which the transitions occur are found to
depend on the lattice parameters of the original layer. The absence of the
{\alpha}-U (001) orientation in the transition products suggests that the
transitions in these layers are mediated by mechanisms other than the [110]
transverse acoustic phonon mode previously suggested for the cubic
{\gamma}-U(110) to hcp-U(00.1) to {\alpha}-U(001) displacive phase transition.
Alternative transition pathways are discussed.

<br>
<i>Gianluca Deninno, Ettore Vittone, Nello Li Pira, Luca Belforte, Fabio Scaffidi Muta, Renzo Costa</i>
<br>
In the automotive industry, the measurement, control and reproducibility of
certain morphological characteristics of surfaces are important to
characterize, qualify, certify and optimize different physical properties, such
as the degree of wear, the degree of adhesion by adhesives, glues or paints and
optical properties. In this regard, this work is intended demonstrate how it is
possible to characterize different surfaces in ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene
Styrene) and PC-ABS (PolyCarbonate/Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) through a
set of morphological parameters defined according to the ISO 25178 standard.
These surfaces have been subjected to different etching treatments performed
with different chemicals, which can radically modify the morphology of the
surface, making it more or less suitable according to the industrial purposes
sought. Furthermore, in this work an analytical relationship between the hybrid
parameters Sdq and Sdr defined in the ISO-25718 standard is also proposed,
valid for many surfaces of general use. This study is based on the use of a
confocal optical microscope and a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), which
allow surface morphology to be studied at the micro/nano scale and the
measurements are analyzed with special imaging and three-dimensional scanning
software that allows the precise measurement of morphological parameters of the
standard ISO-25178.

<h3>Non-Hermitian Skin Effect Edge</h3>

<br>

<br>
Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a unique phenomenon studied intensively
in non-Hermitian systems during the past few years. In this work, we show that
NHSE can be energy dependent by introducing long-range nonreciprocal hopping
into the one-dimensional lattices. The direction of NHSE reverses as the
eigenenergy of the system under open boundary conditions (OBCs) sweeps across
some critical energies. To characterize such a phenomenon, we introduce the
concept of non-Hermitian skin effect edges, which separate the eigenstates
localized at opposite ends of the lattice in the OBC spectrum. We find the skin
effect edges are determined by the self-intersections in the spectrum under
periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), which are topological as the winding
number of the PBC spectrum changes sign when crossing them. Moreover, the NHSE
edges will disappear when the self-intersections merge into a single point by
tuning the system parameters. Our work reveals the intricate interplay between
NHSE and long-range hopping in non-Hermitian systems.

We report the Pockels electro-optic properties of ZrO2 and HfO2 orthorhombic
Pbc21 and rhombohedral R3m ferroelectric phases, and we compare them to the
well-known LiNbO3 Pockels material from density functional theory calculations
using the CRYSTAL suite of programs. Specifically, three essential processes
are explicitly investigated: The electronic, the ionic (or vibrational), and
the piezoelectric contributions. Our calculations reveal that the ionic part
coming from the low frequency phonon modes contributes the most to the
electro-optic coefficients of rhombohedral LiNbO3 and of orthorhombic ZrO2 and
HfO2. While these low-frequency modes show zero contribution to Pockels
coefficients for the rhombohedral phase of the latter compounds.

<br>
In the present paper, a systematic approach is presented for solution of
two-dimensional massless Dirac equation with external electrostatic potential
applied. This approach is based on the new - asymmetric - form of SUSY-like
intertwining relations. It allows to build a wide variety of pairs of
SUSY-partner external scalar potentials. If one of them is simple enough to be
solvable, its partner is also solvable although it may have a non-trivial
dependency on both coordinates. Physically, this kind of problems is related to
the description of graphene and some other materials with external potential.
Solvability obtained by means of asymmetric form of SUSY intertwining relations
allows to extend the class of analytically solvable two-dimensional models.

<br>
The propulsion of colloidal particles via planar traveling ultrasound waves
has attracted increasing attention in recent years. A frequently studied type
of particles is bullet-shaped and cup-shaped nano- and microparticles. Based on
acoustofluidic simulations, this article investigates how the propulsion of
bullet-shaped particles depends on their length and diameter, where cup-shaped
particles are included as limiting cases corresponding to the smallest particle
length. The structure of the flow field generated by the particles is discussed
and it is shown that the particles' propulsion strength increases with their
length and diameter. When varying the diameter, we observed also a sign change
of the propulsion. This work complements previous experimental studies that
have addressed such particles only for particular aspect ratios, and the
provided understanding of how the propulsion of the particles depends on their
dimensions will prospectively be helpful for the choice of particle shapes that
are most suitable for future experimental studies.

<br>
GeSn is a promising group-IV semiconductor material for on-chip Si photonics
devices and high-mobility transistors. These devices require the use of doped
GeSn regions, achieved preferably in-situ during epitaxy. From the electronic
valence point of view, p-type dopants of group-IV materials include B, Al, Ga
and In. The latter element has never been investigated as p-type dopant in
GeSn. In this work, we explore in-situ In p-type doping of GeSn grown by MBE.
We show that In acts as a surfactant during epitaxial growth of GeSn:In,
accumulating on surface and inducing segregation in the form of mobile Sn-In
liquid droplets, strongly affecting the local composition of the material. This
work provides insights in the thermodynamic origins of this behavior, and
discourages the utilization of In in GeSn-based optoelectronic devices.

<br>
It is necessary to break both time-reversal and parity symmetries to realize
a Josephson, or superconducting, diode exhibiting nonreciprocal critical
direct-currents (DC). In fact, these conditions are still insufficient. The
dependencies of the free energy on the phase difference across the junction and
the magnetic field are classified, exhibiting the current-reversion (JR),
field-reversion, and field-current reversion conditions, respectively. To
exhibit the DC Josephson diode effect, all symmetries satisfying the JR
condition need to be broken. The relations of critical currents with respect to
the magnetic field are classified into five classes, including three exhibiting
the diode effect. These symmetry considerations are applied to concrete
examples. Our work reveals that the DC Josephson diode effect is a natural
consequence of the JR symmetry breaking, hence, providing a guiding principle
to understand or design a DC Josephson diode.

<h3>Planar Josephson junctions in germanium: Effect of cubic spin-orbit  interaction</h3>

<br>
Planar Josephson junctions comprising semiconductors with strong spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) are promising platforms to host Majorana bound states (MBSs).
In this context, two-dimensional hole gases in germanium (Ge) are favorable
candidates due to their particularly large SOI. In contrast to electron gases,
where the SOI is a linear function of momentum, the SOI is cubic in momentum
for a hole gas in planar Ge. Using a discretized model, we numerically simulate
a Ge planar Josephson junction and show that it can host MBSs. Interestingly,
we find that the cubic SOI yields an asymmetric phase diagram as a function of
the superconducting phase difference across the junction. We also find that
trivial Andreev bound states can imitate the signatures of MBSs in a Ge planar
Josephson junction, therefore making the experimental detection of MBSs
difficult. We use experimentally realistic parameters to assess if the
topological phase is accessible within experimental limitations. Our analysis
shows that two-dimensional Ge is an auspicious candidate for topological
phases.

Electronic structure calculations have been instrumental in providing many
important insights into a range of physical and chemical properties of various
molecular and solid-state systems. Their importance to various fields,
including materials science, chemical sciences, computational chemistry and
device physics, is underscored by the large fraction of available public
supercomputing resources devoted to these calculations. As we enter the
exascale era, exciting new opportunities to increase simulation numbers, sizes,
and accuracies present themselves. In order to realize these promises, the
community of electronic structure software developers will however first have
to tackle a number of challenges pertaining to the efficient use of new
architectures that will rely heavily on massive parallelism and hardware
accelerators. This roadmap provides a broad overview of the state-of-the-art in
electronic structure calculations and of the various new directions being
pursued by the community. It covers 14 electronic structure codes, presenting
their current status, their development priorities over the next five years,
and their plans towards tackling the challenges and leveraging the
opportunities presented by the advent of exascale computing.

<h3>Exactly solvable Hamiltonian model of the doubled Ising and  $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code topological phases separated by a gapped domain  wall via anyon condensation</h3>

In this paper, we construct an exactly lattice Hamiltonian model of two
topological phases separated by a gapped domain wall via anyon condensation. To
be specific, we study the properties of this model in the case of the doubled
Ising phase and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code phase with a gapped domain wall in
between. Our model is a concrete spatial counterpart of the phase transition
triggered by anyon condensation, in the sense that the algebraically understood
phenomena, such as splitting, identification, and confinement, in anyon
condensation can be manifested in the spatial wavefunctions of our model. Our
model also helps generalize the characteristic properties of a single
topological phase: We find that the ground state degeneracy of two topological
phases separated by two gapped domain walls on the torus is equal to the number
of quasiparticle types in the gapped domain walls; we also find the $S$ and $T$
matrices of our model.

The centrosymmetric tetragonal itinerant magnet EuAl$_{4}$ exhibits an
intricate magnetic phase diagram including rhombic and square skyrmion-lattice
(SkL) phases in the external magnetic field. Here, we report a dilatometric
investigation on EuAl$_{4}$ for three principal axes by means of the
fiber-Bragg-grating technique, revealing anisotropic magnetostriction and
magnetovolume effect associated with successive phase transitions. The rhombic
and square SkL phases are found to possess $\sim$0.10$\%$ and $\sim$0.03$\%$
orthorhombic structural distortion within the $ab$ plane, respectively. We
propose that the coupling between the spin system and the lattice deformation
should be essential for the structural instability in EuAl$_{4}$, yielding a
rich variety of topological spin textures with spontaneous rotational-symmetry
breaking as well as a potential controllability of the SkL phases by uniaxial
stress or pressure.

Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates are an emerging family of superconductors
whose similarities and differences to cuprate superconductors are under intense
debate. To date, the IL phase of nickelates can only be reached via topotactic
oxygen reduction of the perovskite phase, using H$_2$ gas or reducing agents
such as CaH$_2$. While the topotactic reduction method has been widely employed
on thin film and polycrystalline powder samples, the reduction of
La$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$NiO$_3$ single-crystals with lateral dimensions up to 150
$\mu$m was achieved only recently, using an indirect contact method with
CaH$_2$. Here we report the topotactic transformation of much larger LaNiO$_3$
crystals with lateral dimensions of more than one millimeter, via direct
contact with CaH$_2$. We characterize the crystalline, magnetic, and electronic
properties of the obtained IL LaNiO$_{2}$ crystals by powder and single-crystal
x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetometry, electrical transport, and x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The amount of incorporated
topotactic hydrogen due to the reduction process is determined by a gas
extraction method. In addition, we investigate the evolution of the lattice
parameters under hydrostatic pressure up to 12 GPa, using high-resolution
synchrotron XRD. Furthermore, we provide a direct comparison of several
physical properties of the LaNiO$_{2}$ crystals to their powder and thin film
counterparts.

Transition metal dichalcogenide-based moire superlattices exhibit very strong
electron-electron correlations, thus giving rise to strongly correlated quantum
phenomena such as generalized Wigner crystal states1-8. Theoretical studies
predict that unusual quasiparticle excitations across the correlated gap
between upper and lower Hubbard bands can arise due to long-range Coulomb
interactions in generalized Wigner crystal states7,9. Here we describe a new
scanning single-electron charging (SSEC) spectroscopy technique with nanometer
spatial resolution and single-electron charge resolution that enables us to
directly image electron and hole wavefunctions and to determine the
thermodynamic gap of generalized Wigner crystal states in twisted WS2 moire
heterostructures. High-resolution SSEC spectroscopy was achieved by combining
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with a monolayer graphene sensing layer,
thus enabling the generation of individual electron and hole quasiparticles in
generalized Wigner crystals. We show that electron and hole quasiparticles have
complementary wavefunction distributions and that thermodynamic gaps of order
50meV exist for the 1/3 and 2/3 generalized Wigner crystal states.

<h3>Computer Vision Applied to In-Situ Specimen Orientation Adjustment for  Quantitative SEM Analysis</h3>

Quantitative analysis methods based on the usage of a scanning electron
microscope (SEM), such as energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, often require
specimens to have a flat surface oriented normal to the electron beam. In-situ
procedures for putting microscopic flat surfaces into this orientation
generally rely on stereoscopic methods that measure the change in surface
vector projections when the surface is tilted by some known angle. Although
these methods have been used in the past, there is no detailed statistical
analysis of the uncertainties involved in such methods, which leaves an
uncertainty in how precisely a specimen can be oriented. Here, we present a
first principles derivation of a specimen orientation method and apply our
method to a flat sample to demonstrate it. Unlike previous works, we develop a
computer vision program using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform to automate
and expedite the process of making measurements on our SEM images, thus
enabling a detailed statistical analysis of the method with a large sample
size. We find that our specimen orientation method is able to orient flat
surfaces with high precision and can further provide insight into errors
involved in the standard SEM rotation and tilt operations.

<h3>Emergence of a low-energy excitonic state in single layer WS2 with 1H/1T  phase mixture</h3>

Transition metal dichalcogenides possess a unique combination of properties
that make them a malleable platform to study and engineer light-matter
interactions. On one hand, monolayers of WS2 naturally occur in the
semiconducting 1H phase whose optical properties are dominated by excitons
emerging from the band edges at the K valley. On the other hand, the 1T phase
exhibits metallic properties and can be triggered by weak external stimuli.
Here we use plasma irradiation to engineer a 1H/1T mixed phase state in WS2 and
control the grain size of the 1T patches by tuning the irradiation time. We
show that in the mixed phase WS2 a band nesting effect gives rise to new
critical points resulting in a low-energy excitonic transition below the A
exciton. Compared to standard excitons in WS2, this new resonance shows larger
absorption and longer lifetime. The combination of these properties suggests
new concepts for exciton-based optoelectronic devices that could stem from the
control of phase mixture states in two-dimensional semiconductors.

<h3>Polymorphism in tubulin assemblies: a mechanical model</h3>

We investigate the mechanical origin of polymorphic structures in
two-dimensional tubulin assemblies, of which microtubules are the best known
example. These structures feature twisted ribbons, flat tubulin sheets,
macrotubules, and hoops, and they spontaneously assemble depending on the
chemical environment. Upon modelling tubulin aggregates as minimally
anisotropic elastic shells and using a combination of numerical simulations and
analytical work, we show that the mechanical strain in tubulin lattices,
originating from asymmetries at the single dimer level, naturally gives rise to
polymorphic assemblies, among which cylinders and other tubular structures are
predominant for a wide range of values of spontaneous curvature. Furthermore,
our model suggests that switching the sign of the sheets' spontaneous Gaussian
curvature from positive (i.e. sphere-like) to negative (i.e. saddle-like),
could provide a possible route to microtubules disassembly.
