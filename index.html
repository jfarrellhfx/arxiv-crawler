<h3>Instantaneous Response and Quantum Geometry of Insulators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07052" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07052</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nishchhal Verma, Raquel Queiroz</i>
<p>We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a
comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators
observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point
motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum
rules of electronic conductivity. Therefore, tQGT enables a systematic and
basis-independent framework to compute the instantaneous response of
insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and the
dielectric constant in low-energy effective theories. It allows for a
consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of
occupied and unoccupied states in an effective low-energy description of an
infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in
periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer
from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated
flat bands.

<h3>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate  moiré Chern bands</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07054</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chao-Ming Jian, Cenke Xu</i>
<p>We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by
the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor
$\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'{e}
system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a
topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with
Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern
bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the
half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following
features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order with 32 Abelian anyons
(including the electron); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric
charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the spin-Hall conductivity, implying that
the mFTI's robust edge state remains gapless whenever time-reversal symmetry
and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense
that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the topological
order's complexity) within all the topological orders that can potentially be
realized at the same electron filling of the system and with the same Hall
transports; (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled
"product topological orders" with larger quantum dimensions. It is also a
symmetry-enriched topological order promoted from multiple symmetry-protected
topological states, after gauging part of their symmetries.

<h3>Orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons: equilibrium formulation,  magneto-electric phenomena, and the orbital Hall effect</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07055" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07055</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rhonald Burgos Atencia, Amit Agarwal, Dimitrie Culcer</i>
<p>The investigation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of delocalised Bloch
electrons has significantly advanced our understanding of magnetic, transport,
and optical phenomena in crystals, drawing widespread interest across various
materials science domains, from metals and semiconductors to topological and
magnetic materials. Here, we review OAM dynamics in depth, mainly focusing on
key concepts and non-equilibrium systems, laying the groundwork for the
thriving field of {\it orbitronics}. We begin by dissecting the conventional
understanding of equilibrium OAM and identify two primary contributions. The
{\it atomic}-OAM contribution is rooted in the angular momentum of parent
atomic orbitals and is prevalent in inversion-symmetric systems. The other {\it
itinerant}-OAM contribution arises from the rotation of the electron wave
packet around its center of mass and it is dominant in systems lacking
inversion symmetry. Following this, we explore recent theoretical and
experimental developments in out-of-equilibrium systems. We specifically focus
on the generation of an OAM density via the orbital magneto-electric, or
Edelstein effect, the generation of an OAM current via the orbital Hall effect,
the orbital torque resulting from them, along with their reciprocal
non-equilibrium counterparts -- the inverse orbital Edelstein and inverse
orbital Hall effects, as well as OAM conservation. Beyond discussing the
current excitement and challenges in this rapidly evolving field, we
highlighted the future prospects of {\it orbitronics}.

<h3>The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia: A  unified approach</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07069</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alexandre Landry, Fayçal Hammad, Reza Saadati</i>
<p>The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia is studied
in a unified way. We make use of an algebraic approach, as opposed to an
analytic approach. We examine how both the integer and the fractional quantum
Hall effects behave under a combined influence of gravity and inertia using a
unified Hamiltonian. For that purpose, we first re-derive, using the purely
algebraic method, the energy spectrum of charged particles moving in a plane
perpendicular to a constant and uniform magnetic field either (i) under the
influence of a nonlinear gravitational potential or (ii) under the influence of
a constant rotation. The general Hamiltonian for describing the combined effect
of gravity, rotation and inertia on the electrons of a Hall sample is then
built and the eigenstates are obtained. The electrons mutual Coulomb
interaction that gives rise to the familiar fractional quantum Hall effect is
also discussed within a such a combination.

<h3>Viscous current-induced forces</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07081</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vladimir U. Nazarov, Tchavdar N. Todorov, E. K. U. Gross</i>
<p>We study the motion (translational, vibrational, and rotational) of a
diatomic impurity immersed in an electron liquid and exposed to electronic
current. An approach based on the linear response time-dependent density
functional theory combined with the Ehrenfest dynamics leads to a system of
linear algebraic equations, which account for the competing and counteracting
effects of the current-induced force (electron wind) and the electronic
friction. These forces, by means of the dynamic exchange-correlation kernel
$f_{xc}({\bf r},{\bf r}',\omega)$, include the electronic viscosity
contribution. Starting from the ground state at the equilibrium inter-nuclear
distance and applying a current pulse, we observe three phases of the motion:
(I) acceleration due to the prevalence of the current-induced force, (II)
stabilization upon balancing of the two forces, and (III) deceleration due to
the friction after the end of the pulse. The viscous contribution to the force
largely increases the acceleration (deceleration) at the first (third) phase of
the process. For the aluminium HEG electron density, we find this correction to
amount to up to 70% of the total electron wind and friction effects.

<h3>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</a>
<br>
</p><i>Piotr Sierant, Maciej Lewenstein, Antonello Scardicchio, Lev Vidmar, Jakub Zakrzewski</i>
<p>Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of
large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to
determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such
a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),
which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However,
tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and
evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found
numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems
at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is
well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what
conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the
thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system
size and evolution time?
This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the
status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about
the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts
towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered
many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and
preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related
to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in
the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena
impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover.
Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength
suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the
questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems
remain a captivating area open for further explorations.

<h3>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yutaro Nagae, Andreas P. Schnyder, Satoshi Ikegaya</i>
<p>We propose a multi-terminal device consisting of an s-wave superconductor
coupled to an altermagnet, to generate highly correlated spin currents via
Cooper pair splitting. Remarkably, we find that the correlated spin currents
are induced by specular Andreev reflections in the altermagnet, an effect that
has up to now been predicted to occur only in a very limited number of systems,
e.g., Dirac/Weyl materials coupled to superconductors. We demonstrate that
positive non-local charge currents and positive noise cross-correlations are
unambiguous fingerprints of the specular Andreev reflections in our proposed
device.

<h3>Effect of Ir growth pressure on the domain wall dynamics in  Ta/Pt/Co/Ir/Ta stacks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07141</a>
<br>
</p><i>P. Domenichini, J. Brock, J. Curiale, A. B. Kolton</i>
<p>The dynamical response of magnetic domain walls to external magnetic fields
in ultra-thin multilayer magnetic films is determined not only by the
composition and thickness of the layers but also by the growth conditions.
Growth conditions can induce significant structural changes inside the layers
and at the interfaces between them, affecting in particular the dynamics of
domain walls, their mobility, elastic tension, and the pinning forces acting on
them. In this work, we focus specifically on the effect of Ir layer growth
pressure in Ta/Pt/Co/Ir/Ta ultra-thin multilayers films. Measurements of the DC
magnetic properties, domain wall velocity and domain morphology in the creep
regime for both constant and alternating field pulses, were performed for a
batch of samples where the Ir layer was grown at different pressures. We find
that the saturation magnetization, the effective anisotropy constant and the
domain wall surface tension grow with increasing pressure and saturate at a
threshold pressure, while the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya field and the strength of
the disorder remain practically unaltered over the range of pressures
considered.

<h3>Killing versus branching: Unexplored facets of diffusive relaxation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>P. Garbaczewski, M. Zaba</i>
<p>We analyze the relaxation dynamics of Feynman-Kac path integral kernel
functions in terms of branching diffusion processes with killing. This sheds
new light on the admissible path-wise description of the relaxation to
equilibrium for conditioned Brownian motions, and diffusion processes with
absorbing boundaries, where Feynman-Kac kernels appear as the building blocks
of inferred transition probability density functions.

<h3>Localized interfacial Phonon Modes at the Electronic Axion Domain Wall</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07165" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07165</a>
<br>
</p><i>Abhinava Chatterjee, Mourad Oudich, Yun Jing, Chao-Xing Liu</i>
<p>The most salient feature of electronic topological states of matter is the
existence of exotic electronic modes localized at the surface or interface of a
sample. In this work, in an electronic topological system, we demonstrate the
existence of localized phonon modes at the domain wall between topologically
trivial and non-trivial regions, in addition to the localized interfacial
electronic states. In particular, we consider a theoretical model for the Dirac
semimetal with a gap opened by external strains and study the phonon dynamics,
which couples to electronic degrees of freedom via strong electron-phonon
interaction. By treating the phonon modes as a pseudo-gauge field, we find that
the axion type of terms for phonon dynamics can emerge in gapped Dirac
semimetal model and lead to interfacial phonon modes localized at the domain
wall between trivial and non-trivial regimes that possess the axion parameters
0 and {\pi}, respectively. We also discuss the physical properties and possible
experimental probe of such interfacial phonon modes.

<h3>Magnon bands and transverse transport in a proposed two-dimensional  $Cu_2F_5$ ferrimagnet</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07169" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07169</a>
<br>
</p><i>P. G. de Oliveira, A. S. T. Pires</i>
<p>The copper fluoride $Cu_2F_5$ is a proposed stable compound that can be seen
as a layered magnetic lattice of $S=1$ and $S=1/2$ sites, corresponding to
copper ions. Intending to cast light on the transport properties of
ferrimagnetic magnons, we use the linear spin wave approach to study the magnon
band structure of the 2D lattice in a ferrimagnetic off-plane order, as well as
the transverse transport of magnons in the crystal bulk. That transverse
(Hall-like) transport can be induced by a magnetic field or temperature
gradient, and within the linear response theory is generated by the Berry
curvature of the eigenstates. As in most of the cases for magnons, the Berry
curvature here is related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between
next-near-neighbors. The band structure of the system is non-degenerate and the
transport coefficients are non-null. We also determine the condition for two
transport coefficients to change sign in response to temperature.

<h3>Pressure effects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of  infinite-layer nickelates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07176" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07176</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shekhar Sharma, Myung-Chul Jung, Harrison LaBollita, Antia S. Botana</i>
<p>Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates
RNiO$_2$ (R= rare-earth), and the subsequent enhancement of their T$_c$ with
pressure, we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic
properties of this family of materials via first-principles calculations
employing hydrostatic and chemical pressure as tuning knobs. Overall, our
analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect,
as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the
charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of
$J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure
can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of
materials.

<h3>Spin-orbit coupling in symmetric and mixed spin-symmetry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07188" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07188</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ayaka Usui, Abel Rojo-Francàs, James Schloss, Bruno Juliá-Díaz</i>
<p>Synthetically spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms couples the pseudo-spin and
spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the
system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two
particles configure symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin
symmetry can be mixed for more particles. We study the role of mixed spin
symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of
three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We
investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact
diagonalization. It is found that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and
repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the
population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. The emergence
of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction
energy. With the aligned interaction on, the avoided crossing between the
ground state and the first excited state is observed only for small
interaction, and this causes shape changes in the spin populations.
Furthermore, we find that the pair correlation of the ground state shows
similarly to that of Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact
interactions and such strong interaction feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit
coupling.

<h3>Anomalous magnetic flux via junction twist-angle in a  triplet-superconducting transmon qubit</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07215</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sebastián Domínguez-Calderón, Harley D. Scammell</i>
<p>Superconducting transmon qubits with strong anharmonicity and insensitivity
to offset charge are highly desirable for low-error implementation. In this
work we propose a c-axis junction, comprising triplet superconductors, and set
at a relative twist angle. Invoking spin-orbit coupling and spin polarization,
which are known to occur in the material platform of choice, we examine the
resulting transmon Hamiltonian. This junction allows for direct control of the
single and double Cooper pair tunneling strength, and most remarkably, an
anomalous magnetic flux -- i.e. a phase offset equivalent to magnetic flux, yet
in zero magnetic field. Having control over these three parameters -- single
and double pair tunneling and anomalous flux -- allows for optimal design of
the transmon qubit. Interestingly, in this architecture, the anomalous flux is
determined by the twist angle of the junction, thereby offering a novel
zero-field functionality. Our key results rely on symmetry arguments, for
concreteness we demonstrate the implementation of our concept using a model of
moir\'e graphene-based c-axis junctions.

<h3>Spatially resolved random telegraph fluctuations of a single trap at the  Si/SiO2 interface</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07251</a>
<br>
</p><i>Megan Cowie, Procopios C. Constantinou, Neil J. Curson, Taylor J.Z. Stock, Peter Grutter</i>
<p>We use electrostatic force microscopy to spatially resolve random telegraph
noise at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. Our measurements demonstrate that two-state
fluctuations are localized at interfacial traps, with bias-dependent rates and
amplitudes. These two-level systems lead to correlated carrier number and
mobility fluctuations with a range of characteristic timescales; taken together
as an ensemble, they give rise to a $1/f$ power spectral trend. Such individual
defect fluctuations at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface impair the performance and
reliability of nanoscale semiconductor devices, and will be a significant
source of noise in semiconductor-based quantum sensors and computers. The
fluctuations measured here are associated with a four-fold competition of
rates, including slow two-state switching on the order of seconds and, in one
state, fast switching on the order of nanoseconds which is associated with
energy loss.

<h3>Negative orbital Hall effect in Germanium</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07254</a>
<br>
</p><i>E. Santos, J. E. Abrao, J. L. Costa, J. G. S. Santos, J. B. S. Mendes, A. Azevedo</i>
<p>Our investigation reveals a groundbreaking discovery of a negative inverse
orbital Hall effect (IOHE) in Ge thin films. We employed the innovative orbital
pumping technique where spin-orbital coupled current is injected into Ge films
using YIG/Pt(2)/Ge($t_{Ge}$) and YIG/W(2)/Ge($t_{Ge}$) heterostructures.
Through comprehensive analysis, we observe significant reductions in the
signals generated by coherent (RF-driven) and incoherent (thermal-driven)
spin-orbital pumping techniques. These reductions are attributed to the
presence of a remarkable strong negative IOHE in Ge, showing its magnitude
comparable to the spin-to-charge signal in Pt. Our findings reveal that
although the spin-to-charge conversion in Ge is negligible, the
orbital-to-charge conversion exhibits large magnitude. Our results are
innovative and pioneering in the investigation of negative IOHE by the
injection of spin-orbital currents.

<h3>An Exactly Solvable Model for Single-Lane Unidirectional Ant Traffic</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07267" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07267</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ngo Phuoc Nguyen Ngoc, Huynh Anh Thi, Nguyen Van Vinh</i>
<p>In 2002, Chowdhury et al. introduced a simplified model aimed at depicting
the dynamics of single-lane unidirectional ant traffic. Despite efforts, an
exact solution for the stationary state of this ant-trail model remains
elusive. The primary challenge arises from inherent fluctuations in the total
amount of pheromone along the ant-trail. These fluctuations significantly
influence ant movement. Consequently, unlike conventional models involving
driven interacting particles, the average velocity exhibits non-monotonic
behavior with ant density. In this study, we propose an exactly solvable model
for ant traffic whose dynamics is based on the one in Chowdhury et al.'s model,
and then discuss the circumstances under which the non-monotonic trend of
average velocity arises.

<h3>Lateral 2D superlattices in GaAs heterostructures with independent  control of carrier density and modulation potential</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07273" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07273</a>
<br>
</p><i>D. Q. Wang, D. Reuter, A. D. Wieck, A. R. Hamilton, O. Klochan</i>
<p>We present a new double-layer design for 2D surface superlattice systems in
GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures. Unlike previous studies, our device (1) uses an
in-situ gate, which allows very short period superlattice in high mobility,
shallow heterostructures; (2) enables independent control of the carrier
density and the superlattice modulation potential amplitude over a wide range.
We characterise this device design using low-temperature magneto-transport
measurements and show that the fabrication process caused minimal damage to the
system. We demonstrate the tuning of potential modulation from weak (much
smaller than Fermi energy) to strong (larger than the Fermi energy) regimes.

<h3>Metastable ordered states induced by low temperature annealing of  δ-Ag2/3V2O5</h3>

<br>
</p><i>T. Kubo, K. Kojima, N. Katayama, T. Runčevski, R. E. Dinnebier, A. S. Gibbs, M. Isobe, H. Sawa</i>
<p>In {\delta}-Ag2/3V2O5 with charge degrees of freedom in V, it is known that
the charge ordering state and physical properties of V that appear at low
temperatures depend strongly on the ordering state of Ag. In this study, we
focused on the Ag ions in the interlayer and studied the structure using
synchrotron radiation powder diffraction in dependence on temperature. We found
that when the sample is slowly cooled from room temperature and ordering occurs
at the Ag sites, V4+/V5+ charge ordering of V and subsequent V4+-V4+ structural
dimers are produced. Although quenching the sample from room temperature
suppresses the ordering of Ag, annealing at around 160 K promotes partial
ordering of Ag and allows a metastable phase to be realized. This metastable
phase is maintained even when the temperature is lowered again, producing a
remarkable change in low-temperature properties. These results indicate that
the ordered state of Ag, which is the key to control the charge-ordered state
and physical properties, can be controlled by low-temperature annealing. The
results of this study may provide a methodology for the realization of
metastable states in a wide range of material groups of vanadium compounds,
where competition among various charge ordered states underlies the physical
properties.

<h3>Distance-Dependent Evolution of Electronic States in Kagome- Honeycomb  Lateral Heterostructures in FeSn</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07278" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07278</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tuan Anh Pham, Seoung-Hun Kang, Yasemin Ozbek, Mina Yoon, Pengpeng Zhang</i>
<p>In this work, we demonstrate the formation and electronic influence of
lateral heterointerfaces in FeSn containing Kagome and honeycomb layers.
Lateral heterostructures offer spatially resolved property control, enabling
the integration of dissimilar materials and promoting phenomena not typically
observed in vertical heterostructures. Using the molecular beam epitaxy
technique, we achieve a controllable synthesis of lateral heterostructures in
the Kagome metal FeSn. With scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy in
conjunction with first-principles calculations, we provide a comprehensive
understanding of the bonding motif connecting the Fe3Sn-terminated Kagome and
Sn2-terminated honeycomb surfaces. More importantly, we reveal a
distance-dependent evolution of the electronic states in the vicinity of the
heterointerfaces. This evolution is significantly influenced by the orbital
character of the flat bands. Our findings suggest an approach to modulate the
electronic properties of the Kagome lattice, which should be beneficial for the
development of future quantum devices.

<h3>Modelling response time contrasts in superconducting nanowire single  photon detectors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07299</a>
<br>
</p><i>Souvik Haldar, Arun Sehrawat, Krishna B. Balasubramanian</i>
<p>Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector (SNSPD) emerges as a
potential candidate in the multiple fields requiring sensitive and fast
photodetection. While nanowires of low temperature superconducting detectors
are mature with commercial solutions, other material options with higher
transition temperature and faster responses are currently being explored.
Towards this goal, we develop a generalized numerical model that incorporates
the thermodynamic properties of the superconducting material and identifies the
minimum resolvable photon count for a given bias and device parameters. A phase
diagram of detection and latching phases with the minimum number of photons as
a function of biasing current and biasing temperature for each material system
is presented. We show using the developed model that while low temperature
superconducting (LTS) nanowires are more sensitive to the incident photon at
different wavelengths, the ultimate limit of a single photon can be achieved
using high temperature superconducting (HTS) material such as
YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta}, albeit at stringent biasing conditions. On the contrary,
ultrafast response time with three orders of magnitude smaller response times
can be achieved in select HTS materials making it an appealing for several
practical applications.

<h3>A Spin model for global flat-foldability of random origami</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Chihiro Nakajima</i>
<p>We map the problem of determining flat-foldability of the origami diagram
onto the ground-state search problem of spin glass model on random graphs. If
the origami diagram is locally flat-foldable around each vertex, a pre-folded
diagram, showing the planar-positional relationship of the facet, can be
obtained. For remaining combinatorial problem on layer ordering of facets can
be described as a spin model. A spin variable is assigned for the
layer-ordering of each pair of facets which have an overlap in the pre-folded
diagram. The interactions to prohibit the intrusion of each facet into the
other component of the same origami diagram are introduced among two or four
spins. The flat-foldability of the diagram is closely related to the
(non-)existence of frustrated loops on the spin model with the interactions on
the random (hyper)graph.

<p>In the pursuit of room temperature quantum hardware, our study introduces a
gate voltage tunable quantum wire within a tri-gated n-type junctionless
MOSFET. The application of gate voltage alters the parabolic potential well of
the tri-gated junctionless MOSFET, enabling modification of the nanowire's
potential well profile. In the presence of light, photogenerated electrons
accumulate at the center of the junctionless nanowire, aligning with the
modified potential well profile influenced by gate bias. These carriers at the
center are far from interfaces and experience less interfacial noise.
Therefore, such clean photo-doping shows clear, repeatable peaks in current for
specific gate biases compared to the dark condition, considering different
operating drain-to-source voltages at room temperature. We propose that
photodoping-induced subband occupation of gate tunable potential well of the
nanowire is the underlying phenomenon responsible for this kind of observation.
This study reveals experimental findings demonstrating gate-induced switching
from semi-classical to the quantum domain, followed by the optical occupancy of
electronic sub-bands at room temperature. We developed a compact model based on
the Nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to understand this phenomenon in
our illuminated device better. This work reveals the survival of the quantum
confinement effect at room temperature in such semi-classical transport.

<p>Revealing the momentum-resolved electronic structure of infinite-layer
nickelates is essential for understanding this new class of unconventional
superconductors, but has been hindered by the formidable challenges in
improving the sample quality. In this work, we report for the first time the
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting
La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$ films prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and
${\mathrm{\textit{in situ}}}$ atomic-hydrogen reduction. The measured Fermi
topology closely matches theoretical calculations, showing a large
Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived Fermi sheet that evolves from hole-like to
electron-like along $k_{z}$, and a three-dimensional (3D) electron pocket
centered at Brillouin zone corner. The Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived bands show a
mass enhancement ($m^*/m_{\rm{DFT}}$) of 2-3,while the 3D electron band shows
negligible band renormalization. Moreover, the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived states
also display a band dispersion anomaly at higher binding energy, reminiscent of
the waterfall feature and kinks observed in cuprates.

<h3>Superconducting switching jump induced missing first Shapiro step in  Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions</h3>

<p>The absence of odd-order Shapiro steps is one of the predicted signatures for
topological superconductors. Experimentally, the missing first-order Shapiro
step has been reported in several superconducting systems presumably to be
topologically non-trivial, as well as in the topologically trivial regime of
superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions. In this work, we revisit the
missing first Shapiro step signature in the topologically trivial regime of
Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation. The missing
first Shapiro step is found to be accompanied by a sharp voltage jump during
the superconducting switching and reappears when the jump is softened by
increasing temperature or magnetic field. The missing first Shapiro step also
reappears with an increased microwave frequency. The sharp switching jump,
existing without microwave irradiation, deviates from the relation given by the
standard resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. Missing Shapiro step
signatures are qualitatively captured by introducing the sharp voltage jump
into the RSJ model. This work reveals a common, yet overlooked, phenomenon that
leads to the missing first Shapiro step, providing a new perspective on
fractional Josephson experiments.

<h3>Understanding the shear modulus of dense microgel suspensions</h3>

</p><i>Maxime Bergman, Yixuan Xu, Zhang Chi, Thomas G. Mason, Frank Scheffold</i>
<p>Polymer microgels exhibit intriguing macroscopic flow properties arising from
their unique microscopic structure. Microgel colloids comprise a crosslinked
polymer network with a radially decaying density profile, resulting in a dense
core surrounded by a fuzzy corona. Notably, microgels synthesized from
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) are thermoresponsive, capable of adjusting
their size and density profile based on temperature. Above the lower critical
solution temperature ($T_\text{LCST}\sim 33$ $^\circ$C), the microgel's polymer
network collapses, leading to the expulsion of water through a reversible
process. Conversely, below $33$ $^\circ$C, the microgel's network swells,
becoming highly compressible and allowing overpacking to effective volume
fractions exceeding one. Under conditions of dense packing, microgels undergo
deformation in distinct stages: corona compression and faceting,
interpenetration, and finally, isotropic compression. Each stage exhibits a
characteristic signature in the yield stress and elastic modulus of the dense
microgel suspensions. Here, we introduce a model for the linear elastic shear
modulus through the minimization of a quasi-equilibrium free energy,
encompassing all relevant energetic contributions. We validate our model by
comparing its predictions to experimental results from oscillatory shear
rheology tests on microgel suspensions at different densities and temperatures.
Our findings demonstrate that combining macroscopic rheological measurements
with the model allows for temperature-dependent characterization of polymer
interaction parameters.

<h3>Towards adiabatic-connection interpolation model with broader  applicability</h3>

<p>The Adiabatic Connection Integrand Interpolation (ACII) method represents a
general path for calculating correlation energies in electronic systems within
the Den sity Functional Theory. ACII functionals include both exact-exchange
and the second-order correlation energy, as well as an interpolating function
toward the strictly-correlated electron (SCE) regime. Several interpolating
functions have been proposed in the last years targeting different properties,
yet an accurate ACII approach with broad applicability is sti ll missing.
Recently, we have proposed an ACII functional that was made accurate for the
three-dimensional (3D) uniform electron gas as well as for model metal
clusters. In this work we present an ACII functional (named genISI2) which is
very accurate for both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) uniform
electron gases and for the q uasi-2D infinite barrier model, where most of the
exchange-correlation functionals fail badly, as well as for strongly correlated
two-electrons systems. Using the exact-exchange Kohn-Sham orbitals, we have
also assessed the genISI2 for various molecular systems, showing a superior
performance with respect to the o ther ACII methods for total energies,
atomization energies, and ionization potentials. The genISI2 functional can
thus find application in a broad range of systems and properties.

<h3>Crystal design of altermagnetism</h3>

</p><i>Zhiyuan Zhou, Xingkai Cheng, Mengli Hu, Junwei Liu, Feng Pan, Cheng Song</i>
<p>Symmetry plays a fundamental role in condensed matter. The unique
entanglement between magnetic sublattices and alternating crystal environment
in altermagnets provides a unique opportunity for designing magnetic space
symmetry. There have been extensive experimental efforts concentrated on tuning
the Neel vector to reconstruct altermagnetic symmetry. However, it remains
challenging to modulate the altermagnetic symmetry through the crystal aspect.
Here, the crystal design of altermagnetism is successfully realized, by
breaking glide mirrors and magnetic mirrors of the (0001) crystallographic
plane in CrSb films via crystal distortion. We establish a locking relationship
between altermagnetic symmetry and the emergent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
vectors in different CrSb films, realizing unprecedentedly room-temperature
spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnetic metal. The concept of
exchange-coupling torques is broadened to include both antiferromagnetic
exchange-coupling torque and DM torque. Their relationship is designable,
determining electrical manipulation modes, e.g., field-assisted switching for
CrSb(1-100)/Pt and field-free switching for W/CrSb(11-20). Particularly, the
unprecedentedly field-free 100-percent switching of Neel vectors is realized by
making these two torques parallel or antiparallel, dependent on Neel vector
orientation. Besides unravelling the rich mechanisms for electrical
manipulation of altermagnetism rooted in broadened concept of exchange-coupling
torques, we list other material candidates and propose that crystal design of
altermagnetism would bring rich designability to magnonics, topology, etc.

<p>Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized chiral magnetic textures with
particle-like properties have so far primarily been studied statically. Here,
we experimentally investigate the dynamics of skyrmion ensembles in metallic
thin film conduits where they behave as quasi-particle fluids. By exploiting
our access to the full trajectories of all fluid particles by means of
time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr microscopy, we demonstrate that boundary
conditions of skyrmion fluids can be tuned by modulation of the channel
geometry. We observe as a function of channel width deviations from classical
flow profiles even into the no- or partial-slip regime. Unlike conventional
colloids, the skyrmion Hall effect can also introduce transversal
flow-asymmetries and even local motion of single skyrmions against the driving
force which we explore with particle-based simulations, demonstrating the
unique properties of skyrmion liquid flow that uniquely deviates from
previously known behavior of other quasi-particles.

<h3>Renormalization of Complex Networks with Partition Functions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Sungwon Jung, Sang Hoon Lee, Jaeyoon Cho</i>
<p>While renormalization groups are fundamental in physics, renormalization of
complex networks remains vague in its conceptual definition and methodology.
Here, we propose a novel strategy to renormalize complex networks. Rather than
resorting to handling the bare structure of a network, we overlay it with a
readily renormalizable physical model, which reflects real-world scenarios with
a broad generality. From the renormalization of the overlying system, we
extract a rigorous and simple renormalization group transformation of arbitrary
networks. In this way, we obtain a transparent, model-dependent physical
meaning of the network renormalization, which in our case is a scale
transformation preserving the transition dynamics of low-density particles. We
define the strength of a node in accordance with the physical model and trace
the change of its distribution under our renormalization process. This analysis
demonstrates that the strength distributions of scale-free networks remain
scale-invariant, whereas those of homogeneous random networks do not.

<h3>Grain growth competition and formation of grain boundaries during  solidification of hcp alloys</h3>

<p>Grain growth competition during directional solidification of a polycrystal
with hexagonal (hcp) symmetry (Mg-1wt%Gd alloy) is studied by phase-field
modeling, exploring the effect of the temperature gradient G on the resulting
grain boundary (GB) orientation selection. Results show that selection
mechanisms and scaling laws derived for cubic (fcc, bcc) crystals also apply to
hcp materials (within their basal plane), provided a re-estimation of fitting
parameters and re-scaling to account for the sixfold symmetry. While grain
growth competition remains stochastic with rare events of unexpected
elimination or side-branching along the developing GBs, we also confirm an
overall transition from a geometrical limit to a favorably oriented grain limit
behavior with an increase of thermal gradient within the dendritic regime, and
the progressive alignment of dendrites and GBs toward the temperature gradient
direction with an increase of G during the dendritic-to-cellular morphological
transition. Comparisons with original thin-sample directional solidification
experiments show a qualitative agreement with PF results, yet with notable
discrepancies, which nonetheless can be explained based on the stochastic
variability of selected GB orientations, and the statistically limited
experimental sample size. Overall, our results extend the understanding of GB
formation and grain growth competition during solidification of hcp materials,
and the effect of thermal conditions, nonetheless concluding on the challenges
of extending the current studies to three dimensions, and the need for much
broader (statistically significant) data sets of GB orientation selected under
well-identified solidification conditions.

<p>We consider the motion of a harmonically trapped overdamped particle, which
is submitted to a self-phoretic force, that is proportional to the gradient of
a diffusive field for which the particle itself is the source. In agreement
with existing results for free particles or particles in a bounded domain, we
find that the system exhibits a transition between an immobile phase, where the
particle stays at the center of the trap, and an oscillatory state. We perform
an exact analysis giving access to the bifurcation threshold, as well as the
frequency of oscillations and their amplitude near the threshold. Our analysis
also characterizes the shape of two-dimensional oscillations, that take place
along a circle or a straight line. Our results are confirmed by numerical
simulations.

<p>The polarization control of micro/nano lasers is an important topic in
nanophotonics. Up to now, the simultaneous generation of two distinguishable
orthogonally-polarized lasing modes from a single organic microlaser remains a
critical challenge. Here, we demonstrate simultaneously orthogonally-polarized
dual lasing from a microcavity filled with an organic single crystal exhibiting
selective strong coupling. We show that the non-Hermiticity due to
polarization-dependent losses leads to the formation of real and imaginary
Fermi arcs with exceptional points. Simultaneous orthogonally-polarized lasing
becomes possible thanks to the eigenstate mixing by the photonic spin-orbit
coupling at the imaginary Fermi arcs. Our work provides a novel way to develop
linearly-polarized lasers and paves the way for the future fundamental research
in topological photonics, non-Hermitian optics, and other fields.

<p>Magnetic phase diagram for the Hubbard model on the Beta-Mn type lattice has
been calculated as a function of the Coulomb interaction energy parameter U and
the electron number per atom n by using the generalized Hartree-Fock
approximation combined with the recursion method for electronic-structure
calculations. The ferromagnetic state, the ferrimagnetic state, and the
helimagnetic state as well as the 3Q multiple spin density waves (3QMSDW)
states have been obtained on the U-n plane. Their detailed structures are
examined with use of the Fourier analysis. It is shown that the calculated

<p>Describing the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for
applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the
properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials.
However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems
poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due
to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces
a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing
mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed
methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling
the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron
correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow
transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to
parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo
technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent
parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the
solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in
intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear
signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field
methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to
accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into
the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities
of mean-field.

<p>The discovery of superconductivity in the infinite-layer (IL) nickelates
provides a new platform and angle of view to study the long-standing problem of
high temperature superconductivity . Many models were proposed to understand
its superconducting mechanisms based on the calculated electronic structure,
and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create
complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past 5 years, the lack of
direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding
of nickelate superconductors. Here, we fill this gap by preparing IL LaNiO$_2$
and La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films with superior surface quality and
measuring their electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES).The Fermi surface consists of a large three-dimensional
hole pocket primarily contributed by Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and a small
electron pocket at the Brillouin zone (BZ) corner. The hole pocket exhibits a
two-dimensional character over approximately 80% of the Brillouin zone, and its
Fermi surface topology and band dispersion closely resemble those observed in
hole-doped cuprates, suggesting their superconducting mechanisms may be alike.
Yet this hole pocket shows strong three-dimensional character near $k_z=\pi$,
which deviates from previous calculations and adds new facets to the
superconductivity in IL nickelates. The experimental electronic structure
represents a pivotal step toward a microscopic understanding of the IL
nickelate family and its superconductivity.

<p>The detection of inelastically scattered soft X-rays with high energy
resolution usually requires large grating spectrometers. Recently,
photoelectron spectrometry for analysis of X-rays (PAX) has been rediscovered
for modern spectroscopy experiments at synchrotron light sources. By converting
scattered photons to electrons and using an electron energy analyser, the
energy resolution for resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) becomes
decoupled from the X-ray spot size and instrument length. In this work, we
develop PAX towards high energy resolution using a modern photoemission
spectroscopy setup studying Ba2Cu3O4Cl2 at the Cu L3-edge. We measure a
momentum transfer range of 24% of the first Brillouin zone simultaneously. Our
results hint at the observation of a magnon excitation below 100 meV energy
transfer and show intensity variations related to the dispersion of
dd-excitations. With dedicated setups, PAX can become an alternative to the
best and largest RIXS instruments, while at the same time opening new
opportunities to acquire RIXS at a range of momentum transfers simultaneously
and combine it with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a single
instrument.

<p>A unique feature of non-Hermitian systems is the extreme sensitivity of the
eigenspectrum to boundary conditions with the emergence of the non-Hermitian
skin effect (NHSE). A NHSE originates from the point-gap topology of complex
eigenspectrum, where an extensive number of eigenstates are anomalously
localized at the boundary driven by nonreciprocal dissipation. Two different
approaches to create localization are disorder and flat-band spectrum, and
their interplay can lead to the anomalous inverse Anderson localization, where
the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder induce mobility in a full-flat band
system in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) Cage. In this work, we study the
localization-delocalization transitions due to the interplay of the point-gap
topology, flat band and correlated disorder in the one-dimensional rhombic
lattice, where both its Hermitian and non-Hermitian structures show AB cage in
the presence of magnetic flux. Although it remains the coexistence of
localization and delocalization for the Hermitian rhombic lattice in the
presence of the random anti-symmetric disorder, it surprisingly becomes
complete delocalization, accompanied by the emergence of NHSE. To further study
the effects from the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder, we found the similar
NHSE due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, correlated disorder and
flat bands. Our anomalous localization-delocalization property can be
experimentally tested in the classical physical platform, such as electrical
circuit.

<p>Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb and Cs) have attracted much
recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders. Among them,
the charge density wave (CDW) order has been shown to host various
unconventional behaviors. Here, we investigate the CDW order by a combination
of both bulk and surface doping methods. While element substitutions in bulk
doping change both carriers and the crystal lattice, the surface doping
primarily tunes the carrier concentration. As such, our results reveal a
two-dimensional phase diagram of the CDW in doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. In the lightly
bulk doped regime, the existence of CDW order is reversible by tuning the
carrier concentration. But excessive bulk doping permanently destroys the CDW,
regardless of the carrier doping level. These results provide insights to the
origin of the CDW from both electronic and structural degrees of freedom. They
also open an avenue for manipulating the exotic CDW order in Kagome
superconductors.

<h3>Time evolution of the Boltzmann entropy for a nonequilibrium dilute gas</h3>

</p><i>P.L. Garrido, S. Goldstein, D.A. Huse, J.L. Lebowitz</i>
<p>We investigate the time evolution of the Boltzmann entropy of a dilute gas of
N particles, N>>1, as it undergoes a free expansion doubling its volume. The
microstate of the system, a point in the 4N dimensional phase space, changes in
time via Hamiltonian dynamics. Its entropy, at any time $t$, is given by the
logarithm of the phase space volume of all the microstates giving rise to its
macrostate at time $t$. The macrostates that we consider are defined by coarse
graining the one-particle phase space into cells $\Delta_\alpha$. The initial
and final macrostates of the system are equilibrium states in volumes $V$ and
$2V$, with the same energy $E$ and particle number $N$. Their entropy per
particle is given, for sufficiently large systems, by the thermodynamic entropy
as a function of the particle and energy density, whose leading term is
independent of the size of the $\Delta_\alpha$. The intermediate
(non-equilibrium) entropy does however depend on the size of the cells
$\Delta_\alpha$. Its change with time is due to (i) dispersal in physical space
from free motion and to (ii) the collisions between particles which change
their velocities. The former depends strongly on the size of the velocity
coarse graining $\Delta v$: it produces entropy at a rate proportional to
$\Delta v$. This dependence is investigated numerically and analytically for a
dilute two-dimensional gas of hard discs. It becomes significant when the mean
free path between collisions is of the same order or larger than the length
scale of the initial spatial inhomogeneity. In the opposite limit, the rate of
entropy production is essentially independent of $\Delta v$ and is given by the
Boltzmann equation for the limit $\Delta v\rightarrow 0$. We show that when
both processes are active the time dependence of the entropy has a scaling form
involving the ratio of the rates of its production by the two processes.

<h3>Universal Chemical Formula Dependence of $Ab$ $Initio$ Low-Energy  Effective Hamiltonian in Single-Layer Carrier Doped Cuprate Superconductors  -- Study by Hierarchical Dependence Extraction Algorithm</h3>

</p><i>Jean-Baptiste Morée, Ryotaro Arita</i>
<p>We explore the possibility to control the superconducting (SC) transition
temperature at optimal hole doping $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ in cuprates by tuning the
chemical formula (CF). $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ can be theoretically predicted from
the parameters of the \textit{ab initio} low-energy effective Hamiltonian (LEH)
with one antibonding (AB) Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$/O$2p_{\sigma}$ orbital per Cu atom
in the CuO$_2$ plane, notably the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $|t_1|$
and the ratio $u=U/|t_1|$, where $U$ is the onsite effective Coulomb repulsion.
However, the CF dependence of $|t_1|$ and $u$ is a highly nontrivial question.
In this paper, we propose the universal dependence of $|t_1|$ and $u$ on the CF
and structural features in hole doped cuprates with a single CuO$_2$ layer
sandwiched between block layers. To do so, we perform extensive \textit{ab
initio} calculations of $|t_1|$ and $u$ and analyze the results by employing a
machine learning method called Hierarchical Dependence Extraction (HDE). The
main results are the following: (a) $|t_1|$ has a main-order dependence on the
radii $R_{\rm X}$ and $R_{\rm A}$ of the apical anion X and cation A in the
block layer. ($|t_1|$ increases when $R_{\rm X}$ or $R_{\rm A}$ decreases.) (b)
$u$ has a main-order dependence on the negative ionic charge $Z_{\rm X}$ of X
and the hole doping $\delta$ of the AB orbital. ($u$ decreases when $|Z_{\rm
X}|$ increases or $\delta$ increases.) We elucidate and discuss the microscopic
mechanism of (a,b). We demonstrate the predictive power of the HDE by showing
the consistency between (a,b) and results from previous works. The present
results provide a basis for optimizing SC properties in cuprates and possibly
akin materials. Also, the HDE method offers a general platform to identify
dependencies between physical quantities.

<p>The strength of materials, like many problems in the natural sciences, spans
multiple length and time scales, and the solution has to balance accuracy and
performance. Peierls stress is one of the central concepts in crystal
plasticity that measures the strength through the resistance of a dislocation
to plastic flow. The determination of Peierls stress involves a multiscale
nature depending on both elastic lattice responses and the energy landscape of
crystal slips. Material screening by strength via the Peierls stress from
first-principles calculations is computationally intractable for the nonlocal
characteristics of dislocations, and not included in the state-of-the-art
computational material databases. In this work, we propose a physics-transfer
framework to learn the physics of crystal plasticity from empirical atomistic
simulations and then predict the Peierls stress from chemically accurate
density functional theory-based calculations of material parameters. Notably,
the strengths of single-crystalline metals can be predicted from a few
single-point calculations for the deformed lattice and on the {\gamma} surface,
allowing efficient, high-throughput screening for material discovery.
Uncertainty quantification is carried out to assess the accuracy of models and
sources of errors, showing reduced physical and system uncertainties in the
predictions by elevating the fidelity of training models. This physics-transfer
framework can be generalized to other problems facing the accuracy-performance
dilemma, by harnessing the hierarchy of physics in the multiscale models of
materials science.

<p>The phase diagram of the lithium niobate and lithium tantalate solid
solutions was investigated using experimental data from differential thermal
analysis (DTA) and crystal growth. We used XRF analysis to determine the
elemental composition of crystals. Based on the Neumann-Kopp rule, essential
data of end members lithium niobate (LN) and lithium tantalate (LT) was
created. The heats of fusion of end members given by DTA measurements of LN
(103 kJ/mol at 1531 K) and LT (289 kJ/mol at 1913 K) were given as input
parameters to generate the data. This data served as the basis for calculating
a phase diagram for LN and LT solid solutions. Finally, based on the
experimental data and thermodynamic solution model, the phase diagram was
optimized in the Calphad Factsage module. We also generated thermodynamic
parameters for Gibb's excess energy of the solid solution. A plot of
segregation coefficient as a function of Ta concentration was derived from the
phase diagram.

</p><i>Kejie Bao, Huan Wang, Yadong Jiang, Haosheng Xu, Jing Wang</i>
<p>The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction
can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose
that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and WI$_3$ have isolated
nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$
and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern
bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal
atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice
into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the
quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in both materials are comparable with
those in moir\'e systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The
Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These
natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to
explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern
number.

<h3>Steady Granular Flow in a Rotating Drum: Universal description of  stress, velocity and packing fraction profiles covering grain shape effects  from convex to very concave</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07555" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07555</a>
<br>
</p><i>Weiyi Wang, Jonathan Barés, Mathieu Renouf, Emilien Azéma</i>
<p>The flow behavior of granular matter is significantly influenced by the shape
of constituent particles. This effect is particularly pronounced for very
concave particles, which exhibit unique flow characteristics such as higher
porosity and sharper phase transitions between jamming and unjamming states.
Despite the richness and ubiquitousness of these systems, our understanding of
their intricate flow behavior and the local mechanisms driving these behaviors
remains incomplete. In this work, we investigate the effect of particle shape,
ranging from spherical to highly concave, on steady flows in a rotating drum -
a system that facilitates a continuous phase transition from a jamming state at
greater depths to an unjamming state at shallower regions. We develop an
analytical model to elucidate granular behavior within the rotating drum: (i)
Firstly, by decomposing the shear stress, we reconcile the discrepancy between
simulation data and theoretical predictions, establishing a relationship with
the angle of repose. (ii)Secondly, we extend the generalized Bagnold scaling ,
coupled with a non-local fluidity relation based on packing fraction, providing
a framework for a correlation between shear stress, shear rate, and packing
fraction. Additionally, we introduce a characteristic length to quantify the
influence of particle shape and drum speed. This analytical model offers
explicit functional forms for physical quantity profiles, which are validated
experimentally in a thin rotating drum and numerically in a two-dimensional
rotating drum. Our results demonstrate that this model accurately describes the
change of velocity due to the phase transition of granular flow within a
rotating drum. Moreover, for different shapes of particle and drum speeds, the
characteristic length captures the interplay between shear stress, shear rate,
and the variation of packing fraction.

<p>We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a
replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a
variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order
liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated
theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical
equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for
supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter
exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter
$\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are
physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.

<p>Recent research has revealed that the Cr family perovskite ReCrO$_3$ exhibits
intriguing magnetic coupling interactions within Cr pairs, which may not follow
the Goodenough-Kanamori (GK) rules due to the t-e hybridization between
Cr$^\mathrm{III}$ ions. We investigate the complex magnetism involving both t-e
hybridization and Re-$f$ orbitals in the molecular analogue of perovskite
[$\mathrm{Ce_2^{III}Ce^{IV}Cr_8^{III}O_8(O_2CPh)_{18}(HO_2CPh)}$]
($\mathrm{Ce_3Cr_8}$) using first-principles method. Our results have shown
that distinct from the bulk ReCrO$_3$, the superexchange via Cr-$d$ and O-$p$
orbitals can exhibit a unexpected dominate ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-O-Cr
superexchange interaction in $\mathrm{Ce_3Cr_8}$ due to the strong t-e
hybridization originated from the distorted molecular structure. The great
sensitivity of the t-e hybridization with respect to the molecular structure,
e.g., the angle of Cr-O-Cr, can lead to a ground state transition from
ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic state with the changes in the angle of
Cr-O-Cr. The Ce-$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level can reduce this sensitivity
through interacting with the Cr-$d$ orbitals via the virtual charge transfer
process. Our results are strongly supported by a modified superexchange model
based on the t-e hybridization theory. These findings complete the theory of
superexchange magnetism involving the t-e hybridization and $f$ orbitals, and
in the meanwhile introduce a new avenue for fine-tuning the magnetic
characteristics via Tm-d/Re-f interactions at nanoscale.

<p>We present the pressure dependence of the electronic and dynamical properties
of six different CoGe phases: orthorhombic Cmmm, hexagonal P6/mmm and
P$\bar{6}$2m, monoclinic C2/m, cubic P2$_{1}$3, and orthorhombic Pnma. Using
first-principles DFT calculations and the direct force-constants method, we
study the dynamical stability of individual phases under external pressure. We
show that the orthorombic Cmmm and hexagonal P6/mmm structures are unstable
over a broad pressure range and most pronounced imaginary phonon soft mode in
both cases leads to a stable hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m structure of the lowest
ground-state energy of all studied phases at ambient and low (below $\sim 3$
GPa) external pressure. Under these conditions, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase has
the highest energy, however, together with monoclinic C2/m and orthorombic Pnma
it is dynamically stable and all these three structures can potentially coexist
as meta-stable phases. Above $\sim 3$ GPa, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase becomes
the most energetically favorable. Fitting the Birch--Murnaghan equation of
state we derive bulk modulus for all mentioned phases, which indicate
relatively high resistance of CoGe to compression. Such conclusions are
confirmed by band structure calculations. Additionally, we show that electronic
bands of the hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m phase reveal characteristic features of the
kagome-like structure, while in the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase spectrum, one can
locate spin-1 and double Weyl fermions. In both cases, the external pressure
induces the Lifshitz transition, related to the modification of the Fermi
surface topology.

<br>
</p><i>Matías E. di Mauro, Benoît Braïda, Ion Errea, Trinidad Novoa, Julia Contreras-García</i>
<p>We present an efficient criterion for probing the critical temperature of
hydrogen based superconductors. We start by expanding the applicability of 3D
descriptors of electron localization to superconducting states within the
framework of superconducting DFT. We first apply this descriptor to a model
system, the hydrogen chain, which allows to prove two main concepts: i) that
the electron localization changes very little when the transition from the
normal to the superconducting state takes place, i.e. that it can be described
at the DFT level from the normal state; and ii) that the formation of molecules
can be characterized within this theoretical framework, enabling to filter out
systems with marked molecular character and hence with low potential to be good
superconductors. These two ideas, are then exploited in real binary and ternary
systems, showing i) that the bonding type can be characterized automatically;
and ii) that this provides a new index which enables to feed machine learning
algorithms for a better prediction of critical temperatures. Overall, this sets
a grounded theoretical scenario for an automatic and efficient high-throughput
of potential hydrogen based superconductors.

<p>In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the
Extremely Correlated Fermi Liquid (ECFL) phenomenon within the $U=\infty$
Hubbard model. Our approach involves deriving equations of motion for the
single-particle Green's function $G$ and its associated self-energy $\Sigma$,
which involves the product of the bosonic correlation function comprising both
density ($D_N$) and spin ($D_S$) correlations with $G$. By solving these
equations self-consistently, we explore the behavior of $G$, $D_N$, and $D_S$
as functions of frequency, temperature, and hole concentration. Our results
reveal distinct coherent and incoherent Fermi liquid regimes characterized by
the presence or absence of quasiparticle excitations. Additionally, we analyze
the intrinsic dc resistivity $\rho(T)$, observing a crossover from $T^2$ to
linear behavior with increasing temperature. Our findings delineate Fermi
liquid, quantum incoherent, and `classical' regimes in strongly correlated
systems, emphasizing the importance of quantum diffusive local charge and spin
fluctuations.

<h3>Trade-offs and thermodynamics of energy-relay proofreading</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jonas Berx, Karel Proesmans</i>
<p>Biological processes that are able to discriminate between different
molecules consume energy and dissipate heat. They operate at different levels
of fidelity and speed, and as a consequence there exist fundamental trade-offs
between these quantities and the entropy production rate. Usually, the energy
source required to operate in a high-fidelity regime comes from the consumption
of external energetic molecules, e.g., GTP hydrolysis in protein translation .
In this work, we study trade-offs between several kinetic and thermodynamic
observables for Hopfield's energy-relay mechanism, which does not consume
external molecules and is able to operate in depleted regions, at the cost of a
higher error rate. The trade-offs are obtained both analytically and
numerically via Pareto optimal fronts. We find that the scheme is able to
operate in three distinct regimes: an energy relay regime, a mixed
relay-Michaelis-Menten regime, and a Michaelis-Menten regime, depending on the
kinetic and energetic parameters that tune transitions between states. The
mixed regime features a dynamical phase transition in the error-entropy
production Pareto trade-off, while the pure energy relay regime contains a
region where this type of proofreading energetically outperforms standard
kinetic proofreading.

<p>Magnetic Weyl semimetal (MWS) is a unique topological state with open surface
Fermi arc states and other exotic transport phenomena. However, most reported
MWSs show multiple pairs of Weyl points and complicated Fermi surfaces, which
increases the difficulty of the investigation into the intrinsic chiral
transport property. In this wor, we successfully synthesized a soft magnetic
Weyl semimetal Eu3In2As4 with a single pair of Weyl points under magnetic
fields. The Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillation with a single frequency, as
well as a linear hall resistance with the same carrier density, is observed up
to 50 Tesla, indicating a single pair of Weyl points around the Fermi level
with a massless fermion (m* = 0.121 m0, Berry phase). Such a single pair of
Weyl points is further confirmed by the density functional theory calculations.
The magnetic ordering and band topology can be easily tuned by the external
magnetic field. The field-induced MWS Eu3In2As4 with a single pair of Weyl
points is a good platform to detect chiral transport properties, including
possible quantum anomalous Hall effect.

</p><i>Andrea Cavagna, Javier Cristín, Irene Giardina, Tomas S. Grigera, Mario Veca</i>
<p>Experiments on bird flocks and midge swarms reveal that these natural systems
are well described by an active theory in which conservation laws play a
crucial role. By building a symplectic structure that couples the particles'
velocities to the generator of their internal rotations (spin), the Inertial
Spin Model (ISM) reinstates a second-order temporal dynamics that captures many
phenomenological traits of flocks and swarms. The reversible structure of the
ISM predicts that the total spin is a constant of motion, the central
conservation law responsible for all the novel dynamical features of the model.
However, fluctuations and dissipation introduced in the original model to make
it relax, violate the spin conservation law, so that the ISM aligns with the
biophysical phenomenology only within finite-size regimes, beyond which the
overdamped dynamics characteristic of the Vicsek model takes over. Here, we
introduce a novel version of the ISM, in which the irreversible terms needed to
relax the dynamics strictly respect the conservation of the spin. We perform a
numerical investigation of the fully conservative model, exploring both the
fixed-network case, which belongs to the equilibrium class of Model G, and the
active case, characterized by self-propulsion of the agents and an
out-of-equilibrium reshuffling of the underlying interaction network. Our
simulations not only capture the correct spin wave phenomenology of the ordered
phase, but they also yield dynamical critical exponents in the near-ordering
phase that agree very well with the theoretical predictions.

<p>Low-disorder two-dimensional electron systems in the presence of a strong,
perpendicular magnetic field terminate at very small Landau level filling
factors in a Wigner crystal (WC), where the electrons form an ordered array to
minimize the Coulomb repulsion. The nature of this exotic, many-body, quantum
phase is yet to be fully understood and experimentally revealed. Here we probe
one of WC's most fundamental parameters, namely the energy gap that determines
its low-temperature conductivity, in record-mobility, ultra-high-purity,
two-dimensional electrons confined to GaAs quantum wells. The WC domains in
these samples contain $\simeq$ 1000 electrons. The measured gaps are a factor
of three larger than previously reported for lower quality samples, and agree
remarkably well with values predicted for the lowest-energy, intrinsic,
hyper-corelated bubble defects in a WC made of flux-electron composite
fermions, rather than bare electrons. The agreement is particularly noteworthy,
given that the calculations are done for disorder-free composite fermion WCs,
and there are no adjustable parameters. The results reflect the exceptionally
high quality of the samples, and suggest that composite fermion WCs are indeed
more stable compared to their electron counterparts.

<p>Superconductors play a crucial role in the advancement of high-field
electromagnets. Unfortunately, their performance can be compromised by
thermomagnetic instabilities, wherein the interplay of rapid magnetic and slow
heat diffusion can result in catastrophic flux jumps eventually leading to
irreversible damage. This issue has long plagued high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn wires at
the core of high-field magnets. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking
large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm aimed at tackling the complex intertwined
effects of electromagnetism, heating, and strain acting concomitantly during
the quenching process of superconducting coils. We validate our model by
conducting comparisons with magnetization measurements obtained from short
multifilamentary Nb$_3$Sn wires and further experimental tests conducted on
solenoid coils while subject to ramping transport currents. Furthermore,
leveraging our developed numerical algorithm, we unveil the dynamic propagation
mechanisms underlying thermomagnetic instabilities (including flux jumps and
quenches) within the coils. Remarkably, our findings reveal that the velocity
field of flux jumps and quenches within the coil is correlated with the amount
of Joule heating experienced by each wire over a specific time interval, rather
than solely being dependent on instantaneous Joule heating or maximum
temperature. These insights have the potential to pave the way for optimizing
the design of next-generation superconducting magnets, thereby directly
influencing a wide array of technologically relevant and multidisciplinary
applications.

<p>We extend previous inelastic neutron scattering results on the geometrically
frustrated antiferromagnet hexagonal-YMnO$_3$, which has been suggested to
belong to the class of classical spin liquids. We extend the energy transfer
coverage of the diffuse signal up to 6.9 meV within a wide temperature range
around the ordering temperature, $T_\mathrm{N}$. The two distinct diffuse
signals in the a-b plane, the signal localized at $\Gamma$' and the scattering
intensity connecting $\Gamma$' points over the M', are shown to be only weakly
energy dependent. In addition, an external magnetic field of up to 10.5 T
applied along c is shown to have no effect on the diffuse signal. In the
orthogonal scattering plane, the signals are shown to be dependent on l only
through the magnetic form factor, showing that the correlations are purely
two-dimensional, and supporting its origin to be the frustrated Mn$^{3+}$
triangles. This result is corroborated by atomistic spin dynamics simulations
showing similar scattering vector and temperature behaviours. Lastly, data for
the spin wave scattering in the (h, 0, l) plane allow for a discussion of the
magnetic ground state where better agreement is found between the data and an
ordered structure of the $\Gamma_1$ or $\Gamma_3$ symmetry, albeit crystal
electric field arguments dismisses the $\Gamma_1$ as possibility.

We determine several statistical properties of a many-sided cell obeying this
`Gabriel condition.' In particular, the cell perimeter, when parametrized as a

such as $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, there has been no relevant discussion. In this paper,
we investigated the pseudoangular momentum of phonons in crystals with 2-fold
screw rotational symmetry. Taking $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ as an example, we explain
the selection rules in circularly polarized Raman experiments resulting from
pseudoangular momentum conservation, providing important guidance for
experiments. This study of pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ opens up
a new degree of freedom for its potential applications, expanding into new

<p>The search for hidden orders in photoexcited lattice systems is an active
research field driven by experimental reports of light-induced or
light-stabilized phases. In this study, we investigate hidden electronic orders
in strongly correlated two-orbital Hubbard models with orbital-dependent
bandwidths. In equilibrium, the half-filled systems are antiferromagnetically
ordered. Using non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory we demonstrate the
appearance of nonthermal ferromagnetic order in the photo-doped state, if the
two bandwidths are sufficiently different, and its coexistence with
spin-singlet $\eta$-superconductivity in the high photo-doping region.
Spin-triplet $\eta$-superconducting order appears instead if the two bandwidths
are comparable. The rich nonequilibrium phasediagram uncovered in this work
shows that Mott insulating multi-orbital systems provide an interesting
platform for the realization of nonthermal electronic orders.

</p><i>Louis Alaerts, Yihuang Xiong, Sinéad Griffin, Geoffroy Hautier</i>
<p>Point defects in semiconductors are attractive candidates for quantum
information science applications owing to their ability to act as spin-photon
interface or single-photon emitters. However, the coupling between the change
of dipole moment upon electronic excitation and stray electric fields in the
vicinity of the defect, an effect known as Stark shift, can cause significant
spectral diffusion in the emitted photons. In this work, using first principles
computations, we revisit the methodology to compute the Stark shift of point
defects up to the second order. The approach consists of applying an electric
field on a defect in a slab and monitoring the changes in the computed
zero-phonon line (i.e., difference in energy between the ground and excited
state) obtained from constraining the orbital occupations (constrained-DFT). We
study the Stark shift of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in
diamond using this slab approach. We discuss and compare two approaches to
ensure a negatively charged defect in a slab and we show that converged values
of the Stark shift measured by the change in dipole moment between the ground
and excited states ($\Delta \mu$) can be obtained. We obtain a Stark shift of
$\Delta \mu$=2.68D using the semi-local GGA-PBE functional and of $\Delta
\mu$=2.23D using the HSE hybrid-functional. The results of the slab
computations are significantly different than those obtained with Modern Theory
of Polarization ($\Delta \mu$=4.34D for GGA-PBE) indicating a potential issue
with the combination of constrained-DFT and Modern Theory of Polarization, at
least in certain codes.

triangulene chains, which were recently synthesized and measured by Mishra et
al. Nature 598, 287-292 (2021) originates from a superexchange mechanism. This
process, mediated by inter-triangulene states, opens the possibility to control
parameters in the effective bilinear-biquadratic spin model. We start from the
derivation of an effective tight-binding model for triangulene chains using a
combination of tight-binding and Hartree-Fock methods fitted to hybrid density
functional theory results. Next, correlation effects are investigated within
the configuration interaction method. Our low-energy many-body spectrum for
$N_{\rm Tr}=2$ and $N_{\rm Tr}=4$ triangulene chains agree well with the
bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain antiferromagnetic model when indirect
coupling processes, and superexchange coupling between triangulene spins are
taken into account.

<h3>Fine-tuning Neural Network Quantum States</h3>

<p>Recent progress in the design and optimization of Neural Network Quantum
States (NNQS) have made them an effective method to investigate ground-state
properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach
of training a separate NNQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram,
we demonstrate that the optimization at a highly expressive point of the phase
diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields interpretable features that
can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two
dimensions by initially pretraining a NNQS at a given point of the phase
diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points.
Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to
the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has
significant potential to advance the exploration of condensed matter systems
using NNQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and
natural language processing.

<h3>Probing quantum criticality in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4</h3>

<p>CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is unusual in that its ferromagnetic transition can be
suppressed continuously to zero temperature, i.e., to a ferromagnetic
quantum-critical point (QCP), through the application of modest hydrostatic
pressure. This discovery has raised the possibility that the ferromagnetic QCP
may be of the Kondo-breakdown type characterized by a jump in Fermi volume, to
which thermopower S measurements should be sensitive. Though $S/T$ changes both
sign and magnitude around the critical pressure P$_{c}\approx{}0.8$ GPa, these
changes are not abrupt but extend over a pressure interval from within the
ferromagnetic state up to P$_c$. Together with temperature and pressure
variations in electrical resistivity and previously reported heat capacity,
thermopower results point to the near coincidence of two sequential effects
near P$_c$, delocalization of 4f degrees-of-freedom through orbital-selective
hybridization followed by quantum criticality of itinerant ferromagnetism.

<h3>Higher condensation theory</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07813" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07813</a>
<br>
</p><i>Liang Kong, Zhi-Hao Zhang, Jiaheng Zhao, Hao Zheng</i>
<p>We develop a unified theory of defect condensations for topological orders in
all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher
representations. We show that condensing a $k$-codimensional topological defect
$A$ in an $n$+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $\mathsf C^{n+1}$
amounts to a $k$-step process. In the first step, we condense $A$ along one of
the transversal directions, thus obtaining a $(k-1)$-codimensional defect
$\Sigma A$, which can be further condensed as the second step, so on and so
forth. In the $k$-th step, condensing $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only
transversal direction defines a phase transition to a new phase $\mathsf
D^{n+1}$. Mathematically, a $k$-codimensional defect $A$ is condensable if it
is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. In this case,
$\Sigma A$ is naturally a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra, thus it can be further
condensed. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ consists of all deconfined
topological defects in $\mathsf C^{n+1}$. A $k$-codimensional topological
defect is deconfined if and only if it is equipped with a $k$-dimensional
$A$-action, which defines an $E_k$-module over $A$. When $\mathsf C^{n+1}$ is
anomaly-free, the same condensation can be alternatively defined by replacing
the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra
$\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ is determined
by the category of $E_2$-modules over $\Sigma^{k-2}A$. When $n=2$, this
modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D
topological order. The proofs of the most mathematical results will appear in a
mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss some
generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our condensation
theory such as higher Morita theory, factorization homology and the
condensation theory of non-topological defects.

<h3>NPCoronaPredict: A computational pipeline for the prediction of the  nanoparticle-biomolecule corona</h3>

<p>The corona of a nanoparticle immersed in a biological fluid is of key
importance to its eventual fate and bioactivity in the environment or inside
live tissues. It is critical to have insight into both the underlying bionano
interactions and the corona composition to ensure biocompatibility of novel
engineered nanomaterials. A prediction of these properties in silico requires
the successful spanning of multiple orders of magnitude of both time and
physical dimensions to produce results in a reasonable amount of time,
necessitating the development of a multiscale modelling approach. Here, we
present the NPCoronaPredict open-source software package: a suite of software
tools to enable this prediction for complex multi-component nanomaterials in
essentially arbitrary biological fluids, or more generally any medium
containing organic molecules. The package integrates several recent
physics-based computational models and a library of both physics-based and
data-driven parameterisations for nanomaterials and organic molecules. We
describe the underlying theoretical background and the package functionality
from the design of multi-component NPs through to the evaluation of the corona.

<h3>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of  environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</h3>

<p>This research introduces a detailed computational framework designed to
analyze and forecast the complex multiphase characteristics of eco-friendly
lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are essential for developing
sustainable technological advancements. Lead-free piezoelectric materials have
a significant thermo-electromechanical response, although their
electromechanical characteristics vary throughout different phases of the
material. Lead-free piezoelectric materials undergo phase changes, including
rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc)
phases, when the temperature changes. These phases are determined by the
symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Furthermore, multiple
phases exist simultaneously under certain temperature, electrical, and
mechanical conditions, resulting in the material displaying intricate
multiphase behavior. Studying such behaviour is crucial for evaluating the
performance of these materials. The computational approach in this research
relies on Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to model micro-domain phase changes
in the material. This research will enhance our comprehension of the
significance of complex multiphase behaviour in creating environment-friendly
and sustainable technological solutions.

<h3>A twist-grain boundary (TGB) phase in aqueous solutions of the DNA  tetramer GTAC</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07844</a>
<br>
</p><i>Gregory P. Smith, Chenhui Zhu, Mikhail Zernenkov, Guillaume Freychet, Noel A. Clark</i>
<p>We report the observation of a Twist Grain Boundary (TGB) phase of DNA, a
striking motif of three dimensional (3D) equilibrium self-assembly of the DNA
tetramer 5'-GTAC-3', a base sequence that is self-complimentary, pairing to
form 4-base long, blunt-end Watson/Crick (WC) duplexes. Hydrophobic blunt ends
and liquid crystal ordering enable these short duplexes to aggregate into
long-DNA-like columns, even though the double helix has a break every 4 bases.
A further step assembles these columns into monolayer sheets in which the
columns are mutually parallel, and, finally, these sheets stack into lamellar
arrays in which the column axis of each layer rotates in helical fashion,
through a 60 degree angle with each passage to the next layer. This
reorientation in a left-handed TGB helix enables each 2nm diameter WC column to
be parallel to, and to partially enter, the major grooves of its neighbors.

<h3>Hyper-density functional theory of soft matter</h3>

</p><i>Florian Sammüller, Silas Robitschko, Sophie Hermann, Matthias Schmidt</i>
<p>We present a scheme for investigating arbitrary thermal observables in
spatially inhomogeneous many-body systems. Extending the equilibrium ensemble
yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated
local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike
equation. Simulation-based supervised machine learning trains neural networks
that act as hyper-direct correlation functionals which facilitate efficient and
accurate predictions. We exemplify the approach for the cluster statistics of
hard rods and square well particles. The theory provides access to complex
order parameters, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic magnons on a Möbius strip: topology-induced symmetry  breaking</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng</i>
<p>We study a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled
spin chains. To satisfy the boundary condition, magnon excitations feature
linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two
non-degenerate branches of modes that can neither be smoothly connected to nor
be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons of opposite chirality
commonly found in antiferromagnets. Only one branch supports standing-wave
formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral
shift incurred by the boundary condition. Our findings unravel the profound
impact of topology-induced symmetry breaking on magnons.

<h3>Synthesis of epitaxial magnetic pyrochlore heterojunctions</h3>

<p>The synthesis of stoichiometric and epitaxial pyrochlore iridate thin films
presents significant challenges yet is critical for unlocking experimental
access to novel topological and magnetic states. Towards this goal, we unveil
an in-situ two-stage growth mechanism that facilitates the synthesis of
high-quality oriented pyrochlore iridate thin films. The growth starts with the
deposition of a pyrochlore titanate as an active iso-structural template,
followed by the application of an in-situ solid phase epitaxy technique in the
second stage to accomplish the formation of single crystalline, large-area
films. This novel protocol ensures the preservation of stoichiometry and
structural homogeneity, leading to a marked improvement in surface and
interface qualities over previously reported methods. The success of this
synthesis approach is attributed to the application of directional laser-heat
annealing, which effectively reorganizes the continuous random network of ions
into a crystalline structure, as evidenced by our comprehensive analysis of the
growth kinetics. This new synthesis approach advances our understanding of
pyrochlore iridate film fabrication and opens a new perspective for
investigating their unique physical properties.

<p>Quasi van der Waals Epitaxy (qvdWE) has been realized for decades at the
interfaces between 3D and 2D materials or van der Waals materials. The growth
of magnetic topological insulators (MTI) Cr: (BixSb1-x)2Te3 (CBST) on GaAs
(111) substrates for Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAH) is actually one of the
examples of qvdWE, which is not well noticed despite the fact that its
advantages have been used in growth of various MTI materials. This is
distinguished from the growth of MTIs on other substrates. Although the qvdWE
mode has been used in many 2D growth on III-V substrates, the specific features
and mechanisms are not well demonstrated and summarized yet. Here in this work,
we have for the first time shown the features of both coherent interfaces and
the existence of strain originating from qvdWE at the same time.

<h3>Robustness of a state with Ising topological order against local  projective measurements</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07866</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sanjeev Kumar, Vikram Tripathi</i>
<p>We investigate the fragility of a topologically ordered state, namely, the
ground state of a weakly Zeeman perturbed honeycomb Kitaev model to environment
induced decoherence effects mimicked by random local projective measurements.
Our findings show the nonabelian Ising topological order, as quantified by a
tripartite mutual information (the topological entanglement entropy $\gamma$,)
is resilient to such disturbances. Further, $\gamma$ is found to evolve
smoothly from a topologically ordered state to a distribution of trivial states
as a function of rate of measurement (temperature). We assess our model by
contrasting it with the Toric Code limit of the Kitaev model, whose ground
state has abelian $Z_2$ topological order, and which has garnered greater
attention in the literature of fault-tolerant quantum computation. The findings
reveal the topological order in the Toric Code limit collapses rapidly as
opposed to our model where it can withstand higher measurement rates.

<h3>Stability of Anomalous Hall Crystals in multilayer rhombohedral graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07873</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zhihuan Dong, Adarsh S. Patri, T. Senthil</i>
<p>Recent experiments showing an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in
pentalayer rhombohedral graphene have been interpreted in terms of a
valley-polarized interaction-induced Chern band. The resulting many-body state
can be viewed as an Anomalous Hall Crystal (AHC), with a further coupling to a
weak moir\'e potential. We explain the origin of the Chern band and the
corresponding AHC in the pentalayer system. We propose a simplified model that
focuses on the physics near high symmetry Brillouin zone points to describe the
competition between AHC and Wigner Crystal (WC) phases. We discuss the possible
role of the moir\'e potential. We emphasize that even if in the moir\'e-less
limit, the AHC is not favored over a correlated Fermi liquid, the moir\'e
potential will push the system into a `moir\'e-enabled AHC'. We also suggest
that there is a range of alignment angles between R5G and hBN where a $C = 2$
insulator may be found at integer filling.
