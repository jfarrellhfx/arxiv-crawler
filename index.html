<h3>Non-invertible symmetries and LSM-type constraints on a tensor product  Hilbert space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12281" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12281</a>
<br>
<i>Nathan Seiberg, Sahand Seifnashri, Shu-Heng Shao</i>
<p>We discuss the exact non-invertible Kramers-Wannier symmetry of 1+1d lattice
models on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits. This symmetry is associated
with a topological defect and a conserved operator, and the latter can be
presented as a matrix product operator. Importantly, unlike its continuum
counterpart, the symmetry algebra involves lattice translations. Consequently,
it is not described by a fusion category. We present a clear notion of an
anomaly involving this non-invertible symmetry, parity/time-reversal
symmetries, and lattice translations. Different Hamiltonians with the same
lattice non-invertible symmetry can flow in their continuum limits to
infinitely many different fusion categories (with different Frobenius-Schur
indicators), including, as a special case, the Ising CFT. The non-invertible
symmetry leads to a constraint similar to that of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis, implying
that the system cannot have a unique gapped ground state. It is either in a
gapless phase or in a gapped phase with three (or a multiple of three) ground
states, associated with the spontaneous breaking of the lattice non-invertible
symmetry.

<h3>Tunable interplay between light and heavy electrons in twisted trilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12284" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12284</a>
<br>
<i>Andrew T. Pierce, Yonglong Xie, Jeong Min Park, Zhuozhen Cai, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, Amir Yacoby</i>
<p>In strongly interacting systems with multiple energy bands, the interplay
between electrons with different effective masses and the enlarged Hilbert
space drives intricate correlated phenomena that do not occur in single-band
systems. Recently, magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as
a promising tunable platform for such investigations: the system hosts both
slowly dispersing, "heavy" electrons inhabiting its flat bands as well as
delocalized "light" bands that disperse as free Dirac fermions. Most
remarkably, superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene and multilayer
analogues with additional dispersive bands exhibits Pauli limit violation and
spans a wider range of phase space compared to that in twisted bilayer
graphene, where the dispersive bands are absent. This suggests that the
interactions between different bands may play a fundamental role in stabilizing
correlated phases in twisted graphene multilayers. Here, we elucidate the
interplay between the light and heavy electrons in MATTG as a function of
doping and magnetic field by performing local compressibility measurements with
a scanning single-electron-transistor microscope. We establish that commonly
observed resistive features near moir\'e band fillings $\nu$=-2, 1, 2 and 3
host a finite population of light Dirac electrons at the Fermi level despite a
gap opening in the flat band sector. At higher magnetic field and near charge
neutrality, we discover a new type of phase transition sequence that is robust
over nearly 10 micrometers but exhibits complex spatial dependence. Mean-field
calculations establish that these transitions arise from the competing
population of the two subsystems and that the Dirac sector can be viewed as a
new flavor analogous to the spin and valley degrees of freedom.

<h3>Theory of momentum-resolved magnon electron energy loss spectra: The  case of Yttrium Iron Garnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12302</a>
<br>
<i>Julio A. do Nascimento, Phil J. Hasnip, S. A. Cavill, Fabrizio Cossu, Demie Kepaptsoglou, Quentin M. Ramasse, Adam Kerrigan, Vlado K. Lazarov</i>
<p>We explore the inelastic spectra of electrons impinging in a magnetic system.
The methodology here presented is intended to highlight the charge-dependent
interaction of the electron beam in a STEM-EELS experiment, and the local
vector potential generated by the magnetic lattice. This interaction shows an
intensity $10^{-2}$ smaller than the purely spin interaction, which is taken to
be functionally the same as in the inelastic neutron experiment. On the other
hand, it shows a strong scattering vector dependence ($\kappa^{-4}$) and a
dependence with the relative orientation between the probe wavevector and the
local magnetic moments of the solid. We present YIG as a case study due to its
high interest by the community.

<h3>Strong zero modes in integrable quantum circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12305" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12305</a>
<br>
<i>Eric Vernier, Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Lorenzo Piroli, Aditi Mitra</i>
<p>It is a classic result that certain interacting integrable spin chains host
robust edge modes known as strong zero modes (SZMs). In this work, we extend
this result to the Floquet setting of local quantum circuits, focusing on a
prototypical model providing an integrable Trotterization for the evolution of
the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. By exploiting the algebraic structures of
integrability, we show that an exact SZM operator can be constructed for these
integrable quantum circuits in certain regions of parameter space. Our
construction, which recovers a well-known result by Paul Fendley in the
continuous-time limit, relies on a set of commuting transfer matrices known
from integrability, and allows us to easily prove important properties of the
SZM, including normalizabilty. Our approach is different from previous methods
and could be of independent interest even in the Hamiltonian setting. Our
predictions, which are corroborated by numerical simulations of
infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, are potentially interesting for
implementations of the XXZ quantum circuit on available quantum platforms.

<h3>Towards reliable synthesis of superconducting infinite-layer nickelate  thin films by topochemical reduction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12307" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12307</a>
<br>
<i>Araceli Gutiérrez-Llorente, Aravind Raji, Dongxin Zhang, Laurent Divay, Alexandre Gloter, Christophe Galindo, Manuel Bibes, Lucia Iglesias</i>
<p>Infinite-layer nickelates provide a new route beyond copper oxides to address
outstanding questions in the field of unconventional superconductivity.
However, their synthesis poses considerable challenges, largely hindering
experimental research on this new class of oxide superconductors. That
synthesis is achieved in a two-step process that yields the most
thermodynamically stable perovskite phase first, then the infinite-layer phase
by topotactic reduction, the quality of the starting phase playing a crucial
role. Here, we report on reliable synthesis of superconducting infinite-layer
nickelate films after successive topochemical reductions of a parent perovskite
phase with nearly optimal stoichiometry. Careful analysis of the transport
properties of the incompletely reduced films reveals an improvement of the
strange metal behaviour of their normal state resistivity over subsequent
topochemical reductions, offering insight into the reduction process.

<h3>Low-Scaling algorithms for $GW$ and constrained random phase  approximation using symmetry-adapted interpolative separable density fitting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12308" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12308</a>
<br>
<i>Chia-Nan Yeh, Miguel A. Morales</i>
<p>We present low-scaling algorithms for $GW$ and constrained random phase
approximation based on a symmetry-adapted interpolative separable density
fitting (ISDF) procedure that incorporates the space-group symmetries of
crystalline systems. The resulting formulations scale cubically with respect to
system sizes and linearly with the number of $\mathbf{k}$-points, regardless of
the choice of single-particle basis and whether a quasiparticle approximation
is employed. We validate these methods through comparisons with published
literature and demonstrate their efficiency in treating large-scale systems
through the construction of downfolded many-body Hamiltonians for carbon dimer
defects embedded in hexagonal boron nitride supercells. Our work highlights the
efficiency and general applicability of ISDF in the context of large-scale
many-body calculations with $\mathbf{k}$-point sampling beyond density
functional theory.

<h3>Eliashberg theory for bilayer exciton condensation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12313" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12313</a>
<br>
<i>G. J. Sreejith, Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>We study the effect of dynamical screening of interactions on the transition
temperatures ($T_c$) of exciton condensation in a symmetric bilayer of
quadratically dispersing electrons and holes by solving the linearized
Eliashberg equations for the anomalous interlayer Green's functions. We find
that $T_c$ is finite for the range of density and layer separations studied,
decaying exponentially with interlayer separation. $T_c$ is suppressed well
below that predicted by a Hartree Fock mean field theory with unscreened
Coulomb interaction, but is above the estimates from the statically screened
Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using a diagramatic framework, we show that
the system is always an exciton condensate at zero temperature but $T_c$ is
exponentially small for large interlayer separation.

<h3>Finite-momentum and field-induced pairings in orbital-singlet  spin-triplet superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12320" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12320</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan Clepkens, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<p>Finite-momentum pairing in a Pauli-limited spin-singlet superconductor arises
from the pair-breaking effects of an external Zeeman field, a mechanism which
is not applicable in odd-parity spin-triplet superconductors. However, in
multiorbital systems, the relevant bands originating from different orbitals
are usually separated in momentum space, implying that orbital-singlet pairing
is a natural candidate for a finite-momentum pairing state. We show that
finite-momentum pairing arises in even-parity orbital-singlet spin-triplet
superconductors via the combination of orbitally-nontrivial kinetic terms and
Hund's coupling. The finite-momentum pairing is then suppressed with an
increasing spin-orbit coupling, stabilizing a uniform pseudospin-singlet
pairing. We also examine the effects of the magnetic field and find
field-induced superconductivity at large fields. We apply these findings to the
multiorbital superconductor with spin-orbit coupling, Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and
show that a finite-momentum pseudospin-singlet state appears between the
uniform pairing and normal states. Future directions of inquiry relating to our
findings are also discussed.

<h3>Symplectic quantization III: Non-relativistic limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12355" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12355</a>
<br>
<i>Giacomo Gradenigo, Roberto Livi, Luca Salasnich</i>
<p>First of all we shortly illustrate how the symplectic quantization scheme
[Gradenigo and Livi, 2021] can be applied to a relativistic field theory with
self-interaction. Taking inspiration from the stochastic quantization method by
Parisi and Wu, this procedure is based on considering explicitly the role of an
intrinsic time variable, associated with quantum fluctuations. The major part
of this paper is devoted to showing how the symplectic quantization scheme can
be extended to the non-relativistic limit for a Schr\"odinger-like field. Then
we also discuss how one can obtain from this non-relativistic theory a linear
Schr\"odinger equation for the single-particle wavefunction. This further
passage is based on a suitable coarse-graining procedure, when self-interaction
terms can be neglected, with respect to interactions with any external field.
In the Appendix we complete our survey on symplectic quantization by discussing
how this scheme applies to a non-relativistic particle under the action of a
generic external potential.

<h3>Magnetic and Lattice Ordered Fractional Quantum Hall Phases in Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12357</a>
<br>
<i>Jincheng An, Ajit C. Balram, Ganpathy Murthy</i>
<p>At and near charge neutrality, monolayer graphene in a perpendicular magnetic
field is a quantum Hall ferromagnet. In addition to the highly symmetric
Coulomb interaction, residual lattice-scale interactions, Zeeman, and
sublattice couplings determine the fate of the ground state. Going beyond the
simplest model with ultra-short-range residual couplings to more generic
couplings, one finds integer phases that show the coexistence of magnetic and
lattice order parameters. Here we show that fractional quantum Hall states in
the vicinity of charge neutrality have even richer phase diagrams, with a
plethora of phases with simultaneous magnetic and lattice symmetry breaking.

<h3>Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis of Scattering Experiments  Method for Interpretation of 2D Small-Angle Scattering Profiles (CREASE-2D)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12381" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12381</a>
<br>
<i>Sri Vishnuvardhan Reddy Akepati, Nitant Gupta, Arthi Jayaraman</i>
<p>Characterization of structural diversity within soft materials is key for
engineering new materials for various applications. Small-angle scattering
(SAS) is a widely used characterization technique that provides structural
information in soft materials at varying length scales and typically outputs
scattered intensity I(q) as a function of the scattered wavevector represented
by its magnitude q and azimuthal angle {\theta}. While isotropic structures can
be interpreted from azimuthally averaged 1D SAS profile, to understand
anisotropic spatial arrangements, one has to interpret the 2D SAS profile,
I(q,{\theta}). In this paper, we present a new method called CREASE-2D that
interprets I(q,{\theta}) as is and outputs the relevant structural features.
CREASE-2D is an extension of the 'computational reverse engineering analysis
for scatting experiments' (CREASE) method that has been used successfully to
analyze 1D SAS profiles for a variety of soft materials. CREASE uses a genetic
algorithm for optimization and a surrogate machine learning (ML) model for fast
calculation of 1D 'computed' scattering profiles that are then compared to the
experimental 1D scattering profiles during optimization. In CREASE-2D, which
goes beyond CREASE in interpretting 2D scattering profiles, we use XGBoost as
the surrogate ML model to relate structural features to the I(q,{\theta})
profile. The CREASE-2D workflow identifies the structural features whose
computed I(q,{\theta}) profiles match the input experimental I(q,{\theta}). We
test the performance of CREASE-2D by using as input a variety of in silico 2D
SAS profiles with known structural features and demonstrate that CREASE-2D
converges towards their correct structural features. We expect this method will
be valuable for materials' researchers who need direct interpretation of 2D
scattering profiles to explore structural anisotropy.

<h3>The Crossover from Ordinary to Higher-Order van Hove Singularity in a  Honeycomb System: A Parquet Renormalization Group Analysis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12384" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12384</a>
<br>
<i>Yueh-Chen Lee, Dmitry V. Chichinadze, Andrey V. Chubukov</i>
<p>We investigate the crossover from an ordinary van Hove singularity (OVHS) to
a higher order van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in a model applicable to Bernal
bilayer graphene and rhombohedral trilayer graphene in a displacement field. At
small doping, these systems possess three spin-degenerate Fermi pockets near
each Dirac point $K$ and $K'$; at larger doping, the three pockets merge into a
single one. The transition is of Lifshitz type and includes van Hove
singularities. Depending on system parameters, there are either 3 separate OVHS
or a single HOVHS. We model this behavior by a one-parameter dispersion
relation, which interpolates between OVHS and HOVHS. In each case, the
diverging density of states triggers various electronic orders
(superconductivity, pair density wave, valley polarization, ferromagnetism,
spin and charge density wave). We apply the parquet renormalization group (pRG)
technique and analyze how the ordering tendencies evolve between OVHS and
HOVHS. We report rich system behavior caused by disappearance/reemergence and
pair production/annihilation of the fixed points of the pRG flow.

<h3>Two-dimensional silk</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12400</a>
<br>
<i>Chenyang Shi, Marlo Zorman, Xiao Zhao, Miquel B. Salmeron, Jim Pfaendtner, Xiang Yang Liu, Shuai Zhang, James De Yoreo</i>
<p>The ability to form silk films on semiconductors, metals, and oxides or as
free-standing membranes has motivated research into silk-based electronic,
optical, and biomedical devices. However, the inherent disorder of native silk
limits device performance. Here we report the creation of highly ordered
two-dimensional (2D) silk fibroin (SF) layers on van der Waals solids. Using in
situ atomic force microscopy, synchrotron-based infrared spectroscopy, and
molecular dynamics simulations, we develop a mechanistic understanding of the
assembly process. We show that the films consist of lamellae having an
epitaxial relationship with the underlying lattice and that the SF molecules
exhibit the same Beta-sheet secondary structure seen in the crystallites of the
native form. By increasing the SF concentration, multilayer films form via
layer-by-layer growth, either along a classical pathway in which SF molecules
assemble directly into the lamellae or, at sufficiently high concentrations,
along a two-step pathway beginning with formation of a disordered monolayer
that subsequently converts into the crystalline phase. Kelvin probe
measurements show that these 2D SF layers substantially alter the surface
potential. Moreover, the ability to assemble 2D silk on both graphite and MoS2
suggests that it may provide a general platform for silk-based electronics on
vdW solids.

<h3>Electronic Noise Spectroscopy of Quasi-2D van der Waals  Antiferromagnetic Semiconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12432</a>
<br>
<i>Subhajit Ghosh, Zahra Ebrahim Nataj, Fariborz Kargar, Alexander A. Balandin</i>
<p>We investigated low-frequency current fluctuations, i.e. electronic noise, in
FePS3 van der Waals, layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor. The noise
measurements have been used as noise spectroscopy for advanced materials
characterization of the charge carrier dynamics affected by spin ordering and
trapping states. Owing to the high resistivity of the material, we conducted
measurements on vertical device configuration. The measured noise spectra
reveal pronounced Lorentzian peaks of two different origins. One peak is
observed only near the Neel temperature and it is attributed to the
corresponding magnetic phase transition. The second Lorentzian peak, visible in
the entire measured temperature range, has the characteristics of the
trap-assisted generation-recombination processes similar to those in
conventional semiconductors but shows a clear effect of the spin order
reconfiguration near the Neel temperature. The obtained results contribute to
understanding the electron and spin dynamics in this type of antiferromagnetic
semiconductors and demonstrate the potential of electronic noise spectroscopy
for advanced materials characterization.

<h3>Field-induced phase transitions and quantum criticality in a honeycomb  antiferromagnet Na3Co2SbO6</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12448</a>
<br>
<i>Ze Hu, Yue Chen, Yi Cui, Shuo Li, Cong Li, Xiaoyu Xu, Ying Chen, Xintong Li, Yuchen Gu, Rong Yu, Rui Zhou, Yuan Li, Weiqiang Yu</i>
<p>We performed 23Na NMR measurements on a single-domain crystal of the Kitaev
material Na3Co2SbO6, with magnetic field applied along the crystalline a axis.
A positive Curie-Weiss constant is obtained from the NMR Knight shift, which
suggests the existence of ferromagnetic exchange couplings. The
antiferromagnetic ordering is found to be suppressed at a field of 1.9 T.
Inside the ordered phase, our data reveal two additional phase transitions. At
1.9 T, the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/23T1 establishes a quantum critical
behavior at high temperatures. However, at low temperatures, a gapped behavior
is observed at the critical field, which suggests a weakly first-order
transition instead and a possible field-induced quantum spin liquid. Our
results reveal complex microscopic interactions in the system, which may help
to search for possible quantum spin liquids.

<h3>Tensor network influence functionals in the continuous-time limit:  connections to quantum embedding, bath discretization, and higher-order time  propagation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12460" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12460</a>
<br>
<i>Gunhee Park, Nathan Ng, David R. Reichman, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</i>
<p>We describe two developments of tensor network influence functionals (in
particular, influence functional matrix product states (IF-MPS)) for quantum
impurity dynamics within the fermionic setting of the Anderson impurity model.
The first provides the correct extension of the IF-MPS to continuous time by
introducing a related mathematical object, the boundary influence functional
MPS. The second connects the dynamics described by a compressed IF-MPS to that
of a quantum embedding method with a time-dependent effective bath undergoing
non-unitary dynamics. Using these concepts, we implement higher-order time
propagators for the quench dynamics of the Anderson impurity model within the
boundary IF-MPS formalism. The calculations illustrate the ability of the
current formulation to efficiently remove the time-step error in standard
discrete-time IF-MPS implementations as well as to interface with state-vector
propagation techniques. They also show the advantages of IF-MPS dynamics, with
its associated highly compact effective bath dynamics, over state-vector
propagation with a static bath discretization.

<h3>Accurate atomic positions via local-orbital tomography with  depth-dependent interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12466" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12466</a>
<br>
<i>Liangze Mao, Jizhe Cui, Rong Yu</i>
<p>Three-dimensional reconstruction of atomic structure, known as atomic
electron tomography (AET), has found increasing applications in materials
science. The AET has been limited to very small nanoparticles due to the
challenges of obtaining accurate atomic positions for large objects, for which
the projection approximation generally assumed in AET is no longer valid due to
the evolution of the electron probe along the beam direction. To address these
challenges, we have developed a method that represents atoms as local orbitals
and implements a depth-dependent probe-object interaction. Compared to
conventional tomographic methods, the accuracy of atomic positions is improved
by a factor of three and provides a solution for the tomographic reconstruction
of large objects.

<h3>Topological magnons in a non-coplanar magnetic order on the triangular  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12505</a>
<br>
<i>Linli Bai, Ken Chen</i>
<p>The bond-dependent Kitaev interaction $K$ is familiar in the effective spin
model of transition metal compounds with octahedral ligands. In this work, we
find a peculiar non-coplanar magnetic order can be formed with the help of $K$
and next nearest neighbor Heisenberg coupling $J_2$ on triangular lattice. It
can be seen as a miniature version of skyrmion lattice, since it has nine spins
and integer topological number in a magnetic unit cell. The magnon excitations
in such an order is studied by the linear spin-wave theory. Of note is that the
change in the relative size of $J_2$ and $K$ will produce topological magnon
phase transitions although the topological number remains unchanged. We also
calculated the experimentally observable thermal Hall conductivity, and found
that the signs of thermal Hall conductivity will change with topological phase
transitions or temperature changes in certain regions.

<h3>Revisiting magnetic exchange interactions in transition metal doped  Bi$_2$Se$_3$ using DFT+MFT</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12514" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12514</a>
<br>
<i>Sagar Sarkar, Shivalika Sharma, Igor Di Marco</i>
<p>Topological insulators doped with magnetic impurities has become a promising
candidate for Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE) in the dilute doping limit.
The crucial factor in realizing the QAHE in these systems is the spontaneous
Ferromagnetic (FM) ordering between the doped magnetic atoms. Hence,
understanding the magnetic exchange interaction between the magnetic atoms
becomes essential. In this work, we use the Density functional theory (DFT) and
Magnetic force theorem (MFT) to calculate the magnetic exchange interaction
between magnetic impurities (V, Cr, Mn, Fe) in the host Bi2Se3. Through an
orbital decomposition of the calculated exchange, we can identify the nature
and origin of the exchange mechanism that depends on the type of magnetic
atoms, doping concentration, host material etc. Our results show that Cr doping
results in an insulating state, a prerequisite for the QAHE, that remains
robust against doping concentration and local correlation. In this case, the
short-ranged superexchange and long-ranged exchange via the p-orbitals of the
host results in an FM order. For other doped systems (V, Mn and Fe doped),
their electronic configuration and local octahedral environment open the
possibility of finite carrier density at the Fermi energy. Depending on the
type of this carrier (electron/hole) and their localized/delocalized nature, a
short-ranged double exchange / long-ranged RKKY mechanism could occur between
the magnetic atoms.

<h3>Landau-Level Mixing and SU(4) Symmetry Breaking in Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12528" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12528</a>
<br>
<i>Nemin Wei, Guopeng Xu, Inti Sodemann Villadiego, Chunli Huang</i>
<p>Recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on graphene at charge
neutrality under strong magnetic fields have uncovered a ground state
characterized by Kekul\'e distortion (KD). In contrast, non-local spin and
charge transport experiments in double-encapsulated graphene, which has a
higher dielectric constant, have identified an antiferromagnetic (AF) ground
state. We propose a mechanism to reconcile these conflicting observations, by
showing that Landau-level mixing can drive a transition from AF to KD with the
reduction of the dielectric screening. Our conclusion is drawn from studying
the effect of Landau-level mixing on the lattice-scale, valley-dependent
interactions to leading order in graphene's fine structure constant $\kappa =
e^2/(\hbar v_F \epsilon)$. This analysis provides three key insights: 1)
Valley-dependent interactions remain predominantly short-range with the $m=0$
Haldane pseudopotential being at least an order of magnitude greater than the
others, affirming the validity of delta-function approximation for these
interactions. 2) The phase transition between the AF and KD states is driven by
the microscopic process in the double-exchange Feynman diagram. 3) The
magnitudes of the coupling constants are significantly boosted by remote Landau
levels. Our model also provides a theoretical basis for numerical studies of
fractional quantum Hall states in graphene.

<h3>Superfluid transition of a ferromagnetic Bose gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12541" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12541</a>
<br>
<i>Pye Ton How, Sungkit Yip</i>
<p>The strongly ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) has recently
been realized with atomic $^{7}$Li. It was predicted that a strong
ferromagnetic interaction can drive the normal gas into a magnetized phase at a
temperature above the superfluid transition, and $^{7}$Li likely satisfies the
criterion. We re-examine this theoretical proposal employing the
two-particle-irreducible (2PI) effective potential, and conclude that there
exists no stable normal magnetized phase for a dilute ferromagnetic Bose gas.
For $^{7}$Li, we predict that the normal gas undergoes a joint first order
transition and jump directly into a state with finite condensate density and
magnetization. We estimate the size of the first order jump, and examine how a
partial spin polarization in the initial sample affects the first order
transition. We propose a qualitative phase diagram at fixed temperature for the
trapped gas.

<h3>Correlation between magnetic domain structures and quantum anomalous  Hall effect in epitaxial MnBi2Te4 thin films</h3>

<p>We use magnetic force microscopy (MFM) to study spatial uniformity of
magnetization of epitaxially grown MnBi2Te4 thin films. Compared to films which
exhibit no quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAH), films with QAH are observed to
have more spatial uniformity of magnetization with larger domain size. The
domain evolution upon magnetic field sweeping indicates that the magnetic
domains or the spatial nonuniformity of magnetization originates from the
strong pinning of the inherent sample inhomogeneity. A direct correlation
between the Hall resistivity and the domain size has been established by
analyzing a series of thin films with and without QAH. Our observation shows
that one has to suppress the spatial nonuniformity of magnetization to allow
the Hall resistivity to be quantized. The fact that a sizable longitudinal
resistivity remains even for the QAH sample suggests a quantized Hall insulator
scenario. Our work provides important insights to the understanding of the
quantization mechanism and the dissipation of the QAH state in MnBi2Te4 system.

<h3>Study of non-Fourier heat conduction in FinFETs/GAAFETs via synthetic  iterative scheme with large temperature variance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12549" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12549</a>
<br>
<i>Chuang Zhang, Qin Lou, Hong Liang</i>
<p>Non-Fourier heat conduction in hotspot systems including fin or
gate-all-around field effect transistors (FinFETs/GAAFETs) is studied via
synthetic iterative scheme, where a macroscopic iteration is introduced for
preprocessing based on the iterative solutions of the stationary phonon
Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Different from previous work with small
temperature difference assumption and linearized equilibrium state, the
original Bose-Einstein distribution function and temperature-dependent
relaxation time are considered in this paper due to large temperature variance
in practical thermal engineering. Numerical tests show that the present scheme
could correctly capture the heat conduction in both the ballistic and diffusive
regimes. Selective phonon excitations including only heating single phonon
branch, equally heating all phonon modes and Joule heating are studied.
Numerical results show that the differences of selective phonon excitation on
micro/nano scale heat conduction in monocrystalline silicon are mainly
reflected in the energy weight absorbed by longitude acoustic phonon from
external heat source. Unexpectedly, the temperature contours in quasi-2D
FinFETs between equally heating all phonon modes and Joule heating are similar.
Finally, the thermal applications of the present scheme in three-dimensional
single/double-fin bulk FETs and GAA naonsheet FETs with Joule heating are
implemented. It is found that that $6$-naonsheets with width $25$ nm promote
heat dissipation than $3$-naonsheets with width $50$ nm. Effective Fourier's
law with size- and temperature- dependent thermal conductivity can also give
reasonable predictions although there are some deviations compared to the
phonon BTE.

<h3>Vanishing vortex creep at the transition from ordered to disordered  vortex phases in Ba$_{0.64}$K$_{0.36}$Fe$_2$As$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12551</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Hao Liu, Wei Xie, Hai-Hu Wen</i>
<p>By measuring the dynamical and conventional magnetization relaxation of the
Ba$_{0.64}$K$_{0.36}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals, we found strong second peak
effect on the magnetization hysteresis loops. It is found that there is a kink
of magnetization at a field between the valley and maximum magnetization.
Interestingly, the magnetization relaxation rate has a deep minimum at the
field with the kink, indicating a diminished vortex creep. The relaxation rate
at this field is clearly smaller than the so-called universal lower limit of
the relaxation rate characterized by ($S_0\approx \ Gi^{1/2}(T/T_\mathrm{c}$).
This diminished vortex creep is associated with the origin of the SMP effect
and attributed to the strongly hindered flux motion when experiencing the
transition from the quasi-ordered to disordered vortex phases.

<h3>A robust balancing mechanism for spiking neural networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12559" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12559</a>
<br>
<i>Antonio Politi, Alessandro Torcini</i>
<p>Dynamical balance of excitation and inhibition is usually invoked to explain
the irregular low firing activity observed in the cortex. We propose a robust
nonlinear balancing mechanism for a random network of spiking neurons, which
works also in absence of strong external currents. Biologically, the mechanism
exploits the plasticity of excitatory-excitatory synapses induced by short-term
depression. Mathematically, the nonlinear response of the synaptic activity is
the key ingredient responsible for the emergence of a stable balanced regime.
Our claim is supported by a simple self-consistent analysis accompanied by
extensive simulations performed for increasing network sizes. The observed
regime is essentially fluctuation driven and characterized by highly irregular
spiking dynamics of all neurons.

<h3>Pitfalls of Exchange-Correlation Functionals in Descriptions of  Magnetism: Cautionary Tale of the FeRh Alloy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12563" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12563</a>
<br>
<i>Shishir Kumar Pandey, Saikat Debnath, Zhanghao Zhouyina, Qiangqiang Gu</i>
<p>The magnetic ground state of FeRh is highly sensitive towards the lattice
constant. This, in addition to partially filled d-shells of Fe and Rh, posed a
significant challenge for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations in the
past. Here, we have investigated the performance of various
exchange-correlation (XC) functionals within the DFT formalism for this
challenging binary alloy. We have employed Local Spin Density Approximation
(LSDA), various Generalized Gradient Approximations (GGAs), and newly developed
Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional. Our
results show the limitations of any single functional in capturing the
intricate interplay of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties in FeRh.
While SCAN can accurately describe some magnetic features and phonon
dispersion, it significantly overestimates the Fe-Fe magnetic interactions,
leading to an unreasonable magnetic ordering temperature. Conversely, the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA exhibits the opposite behavior. These findings
highlight the challenges in simulating materials with partially filled
$d$-shells using DFT, underscoring the crucial need for developing a versatile
XC functional that can effectively account for the multifaceted nature of such
systems.

<h3>Work statistics at first-passage times</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12583" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12583</a>
<br>
<i>Iago N Mamede, Prashant Singh, Arnab Pal, Carlos E. Fiore, Karel Proesmans</i>
<p>We investigate the work fluctuations in an overdamped non-equilibrium process
that is stopped at a stochastic time. The latter is characterized by a first
passage event that marks the completion of the non-equilibrium process. In
particular, we consider a particle diffusing in one dimension in the presence
of a time-dependent potential $U(x,t) = k |x-vt|^n/n$, where $k>0$ is the
stiffness and $n>0$ is the order of the potential. Moreover, the particle is
confined between two absorbing walls, located at $L_{\pm}(t) $, that move with
a constant velocity $v$ and are initially located at $L_{\pm}(0) = \pm L$. As
soon as the particle reaches any of the boundaries, the process is said to be
completed and here, we compute the work done $W$ by the particle in the
modulated trap upto this random time. Employing the Feynman-Kac path integral
approach, we find that the typical values of the work scale with $L$ with a
crucial dependence on the order $n$. While for $n>1$, we show that $W \sim
L^{1-n}~\exp \left[ \left( {k L^{n}}/{n}-v L \right)/D \right] $ for large $L$,
we get an algebraic scaling of the form $W \sim L^n$ for the $n<1$ case. The
marginal case of $n=1$ is exactly solvable and our analysis unravels three
distinct scaling behaviours: (i) $W \sim L$ for $v>k$, (ii) $W \sim L^2$ for
$v=k$ and (iii) $W \sim \exp\left[{-(v-k)L}\right]$ for $v<k$. For all cases,
we also obtain the probability distribution associated with the typical values
of $W$. Finally, we observe an interesting set of relations between the
relative fluctuations of the work done and the first-passage time for different
$n$ -- which we argue physically. Our results are well supported by the
numerical simulations.

<h3>Keldysh crossover in one-dimensional Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12584" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12584</a>
<br>
<i>Kazuya Shinjo, Takami Tohyama</i>
<p>Recent advancements in pulse laser technology have facilitated the
exploration of non-equilibrium spectroscopy of electronic states in the
presence of strong electric fields across a broad range of photon energies. The
Keldysh crossover serves as an indicator that distinguishes between excitations
resulting from photon absorption triggered by near-infrared multicycle pulses
and those arising from quantum tunneling induced by terahertz pulses. Using
time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group, we investigate the
emergence of the Keldysh crossover in a one-dimensional (1D) Mott insulator. We
find that the Drude weight is proportional to photo-doped doublon density when
a pump pulse induces photon absorption. In contrast, the Drude weight is
suppressed when a terahertz pulse introduces doublons and holons via quantum
tunneling. The suppressed Drude weight accompanies glassy dynamics with
suppressed diffusion, which is a consequence of strong correlations and
exhibits finite polarization decaying slowly after pulse irradiation. In the
quantum tunneling region, entanglement entropy slowly grows logarithmically.
These contrasting behaviors between the photon-absorption and quantum tunneling
regions are a manifestation of the Keldysh crossover in 1D Mott insulators and
provide a novel methodology for designing the localization and symmetry of
electronic states called subcycle-pulse engineering.

<h3>Valorizing Sewage Sludge: Using Nature-Inspired Architecture to Overcome  Intrinsic Weaknesses of Waste-Based Materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Sabrina C. Shen, Branden Spitzer, Damian Stefaniuk, Shengfei Zhou, Admir Masic, Markus J. Buehler</i>
<p>Sewage sludge, a biosolid product of wastewater processing, is an
often-overlooked source of rich organic waste. Hydrothermal processing (HTP),
which uses heat and pressure to convert biomass into various solid, liquid, and
gaseous products, has shown promise in converting sewage sludge into new
materials with potential application in biofuels, asphalt binders, and
bioplastics. In this study we focus on hydrochar, the carbonaceous HTP solid
phase, and investigate its use as a bio-based filler in additive manufacturing
technologies. We explore the impact of HTP and subsequent thermal activation on
chemical and structural properties of sewage sludge and discuss the role of
atypical metallic and metalloid dopants in organic material processing. In
additive manufacturing composites, although the addition of hydrochar generally
decreases mechanical performance, we show that toughness and strain can be
recovered with hierarchical microstructures, much like biological materials
that achieve outstanding properties by architecting relatively weak building
blocks.

<h3>The Young-Laplace equation for a solid-liquid interface</h3>

<br>
<i>P. Montero de Hijes, K. Shi, E. G. Noya, E. E. Santiso, K. E. Gubbins, E. Sanz, C. Vega</i>
<p>The application of the Young-Laplace equation to a solid-liquid interface is
considered. Computer simulations show that the pressure inside a solid cluster
of hard spheres is smaller than the external pressure of the liquid (both for
small and large clusters). That would suggest a negative value for the
interfacial free energy. We show that in a Gibbsian description of the
thermodynamics of a curved solid-liquid interface in equilibrium, the choice of
the thermodynamic (rather than mechanical) pressure is required, as suggested
by Tolman for the liquid-gas scenario. With this definition, the interfacial
free energy is positive, and the values obtained are in excellent agreement
with previous results from nucleation studies. Although for a curved
fluid-fluid interface there is no distinction between mechanical and thermal
pressures (for a sufficiently large inner phase), in the solid-liquid they do
not coincide, as hypothesized by Gibbs.

<h3>Nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution in superconducting resonators:  effect of pair-breaking photons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12607" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12607</a>
<br>
<i>P. B. Fischer, G. Catelani</i>
<p>Many superconducting devices rely on the finite gap in the excitation
spectrum of a superconductor: thanks to this gap, at temperatures much smaller
than the critical one the number of excitations (quasiparticles) that can
impact the device's behavior is exponentially small. Nevertheless, experiments
at low temperature usually find a finite, non-negligible density of
quasiparticles whose origin has been attributed to various non-equilibrium
phenomena. Here, we investigate the role of photons with energy exceeding the
pair-breaking threshold $2\Delta$ as a possible source for these quasiparticles
in superconducting resonators. Modeling the interacting system of
quasiparticles, phonons, sub-gap and pair-breaking photons using a kinetic
equation approach, we find analytical expressions for the quasiparticles'
density and their energy distribution. Applying our theory to measurements of
quality factor as function of temperature and for various readout powers, we
find they could be explained by assuming a small number of photons above the
pair-breaking threshold.
We also show that frequency shift data can give evidence of quasiparticle
heating.

<p>Phosphorus pentamer (cyclo-P5-) ions are unstable in nature but can be
synthesized at the Ag(111) surface. Unlike monolayer black phosphorous, little
is known about their electronic properties when in contact with metal
electrodes, although this is crucial for future applications. Here we
characterize the atomic structure of cyclo-P5 assembled on Ag(111) using atomic
force microscopy with functionalized tips and density functional theory.
Combining force and tunneling spectroscopy, we find that a strong charge
transfer induces an inward dipole moment at the cyclo-P5/Ag interface as well
as the formation of an interface state. We probe the image potential states by
field-effect resonant tunneling and quantify the increase of the local change
of work function of 0.46 eV at the cyclo-P5 assembly. Our results suggest that
the high-quality of the cyclo-P5/Ag interface might serve as a prototypical
system for electric contacts in phosphorus-based semiconductor devices.

<i>Oksana Chelpanova, Shane P. Kelly, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler, Giovanna Morigi, Jamir Marino</i>
<p>The ability for real-time control of topological defects can open up
prospects for dynamical manipulation of macroscopic properties of solids. A
sub-category of these defects, formed by particle dislocations, can be
effectively described using the Frenkel-Kontorova chain, which characterizes
the dynamics of these particles in a periodic lattice potential. This model is
known to host solitons, which are the topological defects of the system and are
linked to structural transitions in the chain. This work addresses three key
questions: Firstly, we investigate how imperfections present in concrete
implementations of the model affect the properties of topological defects.
Secondly, we explore how solitons can be injected after the rapid change in
lattice potential or nucleated due to quantum fluctuations. Finally, we analyze
the propagation and scattering of solitons, examining the role of quantum
fluctuations and imperfections in influencing these processes. Furthermore, we
address the experimental implementation of the Frenkel-Kontorova model.
Focusing on the trapped ion quantum simulator, we set the stage for
controllable dynamics of topological excitations and their observation in this
platform.

<p>The quest to manipulate and understand superconductivity demands exploring
diverse materials and unconventional behaviors. Here, we investigate the BKT
transition in synthesized ReN$_x$ thin films, demonstrating their emergence as
a compelling platform for studying this pivotal phenomenon. By systematically
varying synthesis parameters, we achieve ReN$_x$ films exhibiting a BKT
transition comparable or even surpassing the archetypal NbN$_x$ system.
Detailed current-voltage measurements unlock the intrinsic parameters of the
BKT transition, revealing the critical role of suppressed superconducting
volume in pushing ReN$_x$ towards the two-dimensional limit. Utilizing this
two-dimensional electron system, we employ Beasley-Mooij-Orlando (BMO) theory
to extract the vortex unbinding transition temperature and superelectron
density at the critical point. Further confirmation of the BKT transition is
obtained through temperature-dependent resistivity, current-voltage, and
magnetoresistance measurements. Our findings suggest that native disorder and
inhomogeneity within ReN$_x$ thin films act to suppress long-range coherence,
ultimately driving the system towards the BKT regime. This work establishes
ReN$_x$ as a promising material for exploring BKT physics and paves the way for
tailoring its properties for potential applications in superconducting devices.

<h3>Electron-Electron and Electron-Phonon Interactions in the Dynamics of  Trap-Filling in Charged Quantum Dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12629" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12629</a>
<br>
<i>R. Carmina Monreal</i>
<p>We analyze theoretically the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon
interactions in the dynamics of a system of a few electrons that can be trapped
to a localized state and detrapped to an extended band state of a small quantum
dot (QD) using a simple model. In our model the QD is described by one or two
single-particle energy levels while the trap is described by one
single-particle level connected to the QD by a hopping Hamiltonian.
Electron-electron Coulomb repulsion and electron-phonon interactions are
included in the localized trap state. In spite of its simplicity the time
dependent model has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be
found at a relatively low computational cost. Using values of the parameters
appropriate for defects in semiconductor QDs, we find that the electronic
motion is quasi-periodic in time, with oscillations around mean values that are
set in timescales of typically a few tenths of picoseconds to picoseconds. We
increase the number of electrons initially in the QD from one to four and find
that one electron is transferred to the trap state for three electrons in the
QD. At the more efficient values of the electron-phonon coupling, these
characteristics are quite independent of the value of the electron-electron
Coulomb repulsion in the trap, up to the value above which its infinite limit
is reached. We conclude that strong electron-phonon interaction is an efficient
mechanism that can provide the complete filling of a deep trap state on a sub
to picoseconds timescale, faster than radiative exciton decay and Auger
recombination processes. This leads to the complete suppression of the
luminescence to the deep trap state and to the accumulation of electrons in the
QD.

<p>After several decades of studies of high-temperature superconductivity, there
is no compelling theory for the mechanism yet; however, the spin fluctuations
have been widely believed to play a crucial role in forming the superconducting
Cooper pairs. The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity near
80 K in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure provides a new
platform to elucidate the origins of high-temperature superconductivity. We
perform elastic and inelastic neutron scattering studies on a polycrystalline
sample of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at ambient pressure. No magnetic order can
be identified down to 10 K. However, we observe a weak flat spin-fluctuation
signal at $\sim$ 45 meV in the inelastic scattering spectra. The observed spin
excitations could be interpreted as a result of strong interlayer and weak
intralayer magnetic couplings for a double-stripe antiferromagnetic order. The
absence of long-range magnetic order in neutron diffraction measurements may be
ascribed to a short-range magnetic correlation length perpendicular to the
stripe direction. Our results provide crucial information on the spin dynamics
and are thus important for understanding the superconductivity in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

<h3>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</h3>

<br>
<i>Ylann Rouzaire, Demian Levis, Ignacio Pagonabarraga</i>
<p>We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring
planar spins in two dimensions, affects the behaviour of topological defects.
Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the
two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in
addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape (or phase) of the
defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal
coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically
altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be
enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the
degree of non-reciprocity in the system.

<h3>On the physical nature of pseudogap phase and anomalous transfer of  spectral weight in underdoped cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12647" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12647</a>
<br>
<i>Kirill Mitsen, Olga Ivanenko</i>
<p>It is shown that many anomalies observed in underdoped cuprates, including
anomalous spectral weight transfer and a large pseudogap, appear to have a
common nature due to both the cluster structure of the underdoped phase and the
specific mechanism of superconducting pairing. The combined action of these
factors leads to the fact that at a temperature T lying in a certain
temperature range Tc<T<T*, the crystal contains small isolated clusters that
can exist both in superconducting and normal states, randomly switching between
them. In this case, below Tc with a very high probability the cluster is in a
superconducting state, and above T* it is in a normal state, and the interval
Tc<T<T* is the region of existence of the so-called pseudogap phase. The
temperatures Tc and T* for YBa2Cu3O6+d were calculated depending on the doping
level d. The calculation results are in good agreement with experiment without
the use of fitting parameters. At a given T in the same temperature range, the
time sequence of randomly arising superfluid density pulses from each cluster
can be represented as a random process. The effective width of the spectrum of
such a random process will be determined by a correlation time, i.e. the
characteristic time between successive on/off superconductivity in two
different clusters. This time, according to the estimate, is ~10^(-15) sec,
which corresponds to the effective width of the spectrum ~1 eV and explains the
effect of spectral weight transfer to the high-frequency region. This approach
also makes it possible to explain other anomalies observed in the vicinity of
Tc: the reversibility of magnetization curves in a certain temperature range
below Tc, the anomalous Nernst effect and anomalous diamagnetism above Tc.

<p>The striking discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) of 80 K
in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under a moderately high pressure of
about 14 GPa ignited a new wave of studying HTSC in nickelates. The properties
of the parental phase at ambient pressure may contain key information on basic
interactions therein and bosons that may mediate pairing giving birth to
superconductivity. Moreover, the bilayer structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may
suggest a distinct minimal model in comparison to cuprate superconductors. Here
using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we
studied La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at ambient pressure, and found that Ni
3$d_{x^2-y^2}$, Ni 3$d_{z^2}$, and ligand oxygen 2$p$ orbitals dominate the
low-energy physics with a small charge-transfer energy. Remarkably,
well-defined optical-like magnetic excitations were found to soften into a
quasi-static spin-density-wave ordering, evidencing the strong electronic
correlations and rich magnetic properties. Based on a Heisenberg spin model, we
found that the inter-layer effective magnetic superexchange interaction is much
larger than the intra-layer ones, and proposed two viable magnetic structures.
Our results set the foundation for further exploration of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
superconductor.

<p>Discotic ionic liquid crystals (DILCs) consist of self-assembled superdiscs
of cations and anions that spontaneously stack in linear columns with high
one-dimensional ionic and electronic charge mobility, making them prominent
model systems for functional soft matter. Unfortunately, a homogeneous
alignment of DILCs on the macroscale is often not achievable, which
significantly limits their applicability. Infiltration into nanoporous solid
scaffolds can in principle overcome this drawback. However, due to the extreme
experimental challenges to scrutinise liquid crystalline order in extreme
spatial confinement, little is known about the structures of DILCs in
nanopores. Here, we present temperature-dependent high-resolution optical
birefringence measurement and 3D reciprocal space mapping based on
synchrotron-based X-ray scattering to investigate the thermotropic phase
behaviour of dopamine-based ionic liquid crystals confined in cylindrical
channels of 180~nm diameter in macroscopic anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)
membranes. As a function of the membranes' hydrophilicity and thus the
molecular anchoring to the pore walls (edge-on or face-on) and the variation of
the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance between the aromatic cores and the alkyl
side chain motifs of the superdiscs by tailored chemical synthesis, we find a
particularly rich phase behaviour, which is not present in the bulk state. It
is governed by a complex interplay of liquid crystalline elastic energies
(bending and splay deformations), polar interactions and pure geometric
confinement, and includes textural transitions between radial and axial
alignment of the columns with respect to the long nanochannel axis.

<i>Masaaki Nakamura, Shohei Masuda</i>
<p>We discuss methods for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional lattice
systems using spiral boundary conditions, which sweep all lattice sites in
one-dimensional order. Specifically, we establish the one-dimensional
representation of Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki's method, based on lattice gauge
theory, and the Coh-Vanderbilt's method, which relates to electronic
polarization. The essential point of this discussion is that the insertion of
flux into the extended one-dimensional chain generates an effective current in
the perpendicular direction. These methods are valuable not only for a unified
understanding of topological physics in different dimensions but also for
numerical calculations, including the density matrix renormalization group.

<p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds has
garnered significant experimental and theoretical interest because of the
record-setting critical temperatures. As the direct observation of the
superconducting (SC) gap in these superhydrides is rare, the underlying
mechanism behind its occurrence has yet to be settled down. Here, we report a
successful synthesis of the $\textit{P6$_3$}$/$\textit{mmc}$ phase of CeH$_9$
that exhibits the SC transition with SC critical temperature of about 100 K at
a pressure of about 100 GPa. The observation of the zero electrical resistance
and the critical current demonstrates that the SC phase is realized in Ce-based
superhydride. Quasiparticle scattering spectroscopy (QSS) reveals the Andreev
reflection at zero bias voltage, a hallmark of superconductivity, in the
differential conductance. The obtained SC gap-to-$\textit{T}$$_c$ ratio of 4.36
and temperature dependence of SC gap are consistent with the prediction from
the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory with a moderate coupling strength. The
successful realization of QSS under Megabar conditions is expected to provide a
desired route to the study of the mechanism of superconductivity as well as the
establishment of the SC phase in superhydride high-$\textit{T}$$_c$ systems.

<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12685</a>
<br>
<i>Kristian Stølevik Olsen, Hartmut Löwen</i>
<p>We investigate stochastic resetting in coupled systems involving two degrees
of freedom, where only one variable is reset. The resetting variable, which we
think of as hidden, indirectly affects the remaining observable variable
through correlations. We derive the Fourier-Laplace transform of the observable
variable's propagator and provide a recursive relation for all the moments,
facilitating a comprehensive examination of the process. We apply this
framework to inertial transport processes where we observe particle position
while the velocity is hidden and is being reset at a constant rate. We show
that velocity resetting results in a linearly growing spatial mean squared
displacement at late times, independently of reset-free dynamics, due to
resetting-induced tempering of velocity correlations. General expressions for
the effective diffusion and drift coefficients are derived as function of
resetting rate. Non-trivial dependence on the rate may appear due to multiple
timescales and crossovers in the reset-free dynamics. An extension that
incorporates refractory periods after each reset is considered, where the
post-resetting pauses can lead to anomalous diffusive behavior. Our results are
of relevance to a wide range of systems, including inertial transport where
mechanical momentum is lost in collisions with the environment, or the behavior
of living organisms where stop-and-go locomotion with inertia is ubiquitous.
Numerical simulations for underdamped Brownian motion and the random
acceleration process confirm our findings.

<h3>Optical Snake States in Photonic Graphene</h3>

<p>We propose an optical analogue of electron snake states based on artificial
gauge magnetic field in photonic graphene with effective strain implemented by
varying distance between pillars. We develop an intuitive and exhaustive
continuous model based on tight-binding approximation and compare it with
numerical simulations of a realistic photonic structure. The allowed lateral
propagation direction is shown to be strongly coupled to the valley degree of
freedom and the proposed photonic structure may be used a valley filter.

<h3>The influence of sonication on the thermal behavior of muscovite and  biotite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12696" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12696</a>
<br>
<i>Luis A. Pérez-Maqueda, José M. Blanes, José Pascual, José L. Pérez-Rodríguez</i>
<p>The differences on the thermal behavior (DTA-TG) of mica samples measured
before and after sonication have been studied. Sonication treatment produces
important modifications in the thermal behavior of muscovite and biotite
samples. For muscovite, it produces a broadening and decrease in temperature of
the dehydroxylation and crystallization effects, reaching a steady stage after
40 h treatment time. For biotite, the original single peak profile for the
dehydroxylation of the untreated sample is converted into a two peaks profile
after sonication, the intensity of the low temperature peak increases with
sonication time, while the intensity of the high temperature peak decreases.
The modification of the thermal behavior for sonicated samples has been
correlated to the particle size distribution effect produced by the sonication
treatment. It has been also observed that the cup tip of the sonication
equipment contaminates the samples releasing titanium of its composition

<h3>Curvature effect induce topological phase transitions in two dimensional  topological superconductor</h3>

<br>
<i>Huan-Wen Lai, Meng-Chien Wang, Ching-Ray Chang, Seng-Ghee Tan</i>
<p>Recently, topological superconductor is one of the important topics in
condensed matter physics due to the exotic features of quasiparticles resided
on the edge, surface and vortex core. In our work, we analyze the two
dimensional s+p wave noncentrosymmetric superconductor(NCS) with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling in 2D cylindrical coordinate to find the relationship
between the topological phase transition and the curvature. With analytical
calculation and numerical analyze, we confirm that the topological phase
transition in s+p wave NCS in 2D cylindrical coordinate is related to the
curvature from band theory perspective.

<h3>A corrected single element Maxwell visco-elastic model</h3>

<br>
<i>Jesper Schmidt Hansen</i>
<p>The original Maxwell visco-elastic constitutive model cannot predict the
correct mechanical properties for most fluids. In this work, the model is
generalized with respect to wave-vector and extended with a correction
function. This new model has only two free parameters and avoids the
attenuation-frequency locking present in the original model. Through molecular
simulations it is shown that the model satisfactory predicts the transverse
dynamics of the binary Lennard-Jones system at different temperatures, as well
as water and toluene at ambient conditions. From the correction function it is
shown that the viscous response is significantly reduced compared to the
predictions from the original model when taking the wave-vector dependency into
account. Morover, a temperature dependent characteristic length scale of
maximum reduced viscous response is identified.

<h3>Microscopic theory of field tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev  honeycomb model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12750</a>
<br>
<i>Jagannath Das, Vikram Tripathi</i>
<p>We microscopically derive a lattice abelian mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory
for a honeycomb Kitaev model subjected to $(001)$ Zeeman and three-spin scalar
spin chirality perturbations. We identify the nature of topological orders,
emergent excitations and ground state degeneracy (GSD), topological
entanglement entropy ($\gamma$), and chiral central charge ($c$) in different
field regimes for both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) sign of
the Kitaev interaction. A nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO) exists at
low fields in both cases, with $\gamma=\ln 2,$ $c=1/2,$ and GSD$=3,$ where the
nonabelian anyon, a twist defect, is an intrinsic bulk excitation. For AFM
Kitaev interactions, further increase of the field causes a transition from ITO
to an intermediate trivial topological phase with central charge $c=1/2,$
implying half-quantized thermal Hall response in both phases with no change of
sign. At sufficiently high fields there is a first order transition to a
polarized paramagnetic phase with $\gamma=c=0.$ For the FM case, there is a
direct transition from ITO to the polarized phase.

<h3>Improving single-molecule conductance measurements with change point  detection from the econometrics toolbox</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12769</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph M. Hamill, William Bro-Jørgensen, Zoltán Balogh, Haixing Li, Susanne Leitherer, David Solomon, András Halbritter, Gemma Solomon</i>
<p>Structural breaks occur in timeseries data across a broad range of fields,
from economics to nanosciences. For measurements of single-molecule break
junctions, structural breaks in conductance versus displacement data occur when
the molecular junction ruptures. This moment is significant because the
molecule is likely in its most extended geometry, and therefore resembles most
closely the geometry used in theoretical predictions. Conventional
single-molecule break junction data analysis, on the other hand, typically uses
the entire molecular plateau to estimate the single-molecule conductance, which
skews the estimate when the plateau is sloped. Borrowing from econometrics,
where the study of structural breaks is well established, we present change
point detection (CPD) as a tool to search for junction rupture in
single-molecule break junction data, and improve estimates in single-molecule
conductance. We demonstrate that using CPD instead of the conventional 1D
conductance histogram to determine the mean molecular conductance yields a
standard deviation in the estimate of typically half that of the conventional
approach, greatly improving accuracy. We apply CPD to three separate data sets,
two on 4,4'-bipyridine and one on a silane, two at room temperature and one at
4 K, two in one lab, one in another, to show the wide applicability of even the
simplest of CPD algorithms: the Chow test. This versatility and better accuracy
will propagate into more accurate theoretical simulations. These improved
metrics, in turn, will further improve any downstream analyses, including all
emerging machine learning approaches.

<h3>Boosting macroscopic diffusion with local resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12772</a>
<br>
<i>Henry Alston, Thibault Bertrand</i>
<p>Stochastic interactions generically enhance self-diffusivity in living and
biological systems, e.g. optimizing navigation strategies and controlling
material properties of cellular tissues and bacterial aggregates. Despite this,
the physical mechanisms underlying this nonequilibrium behavior are poorly
understood. Here, we introduce a model of interactions between an agent and its
environment in the form of a local stochastic resetting mechanism, in which the
agent's position is set to the nearest of a predetermined array of sites with a
fixed rate. We derive analytic results for the self-diffusion coefficient,
showing explicitly that this mechanism enhances diffusivity. Strikingly, we
show analytically that this enhancement is optimized by regular arrays of
resetting sites. Altogether, our results ultimately provide the conditions for
the optimization of the macroscopic transport properties of diffusive systems
with local random binding interactions.

<h3>Understanding atom probe's analytical performance for iron oxides using  correlation histograms and ab initio calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12784" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12784</a>
<br>
<i>Se-Ho Kim, Shalini Bhatt, Daniel K. Schreiber, Jörg Neugebauer, Christoph Freysoldt, Baptiste Gault, Shyam Katnagallu</i>
<p>Field evaporation from ionic or covalently bonded materials often leads to
the emission of molecular ions. The metastability of these molecular ions,
particularly under the influence of the intense electrostatic field (1010
Vm-1), makes them prone to dissociation with or without an exchange of energy
amongst them. These processes can affect the analytical performance of atom
probe tomography (APT). For instance, neutral species formed through
dissociation may not be detected at all or with a time of flight no longer
related to their mass, causing their loss from the analysis. Here, we evaluated
the changes in the measured composition of FeO, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 across a wide
range of analysis conditions. Possible dissociation reactions are predicted by
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations considering the spin states of the
molecules. The energetically favoured reactions are traced on to the multi-hit
ion correlation histograms, to confirm their existence within experiments,
using an automated Python-based routine. The detected reactions are carefully
analysed to reflect upon the influence of these neutrals from dissociation
reactions on the performance of APT for analysing iron oxides.

<h3>Tuning Electronic and Optical Properties of 2D/3D Construction based on  Hybrid Perovskites through Interfacial Charge Transfer: Towards Higher  Efficiency Solar Cells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12788" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12788</a>
<br>
<i>Hrishit Banerjee, Md. Khaja Nazeeruddin, Sudip Chakraborty</i>
<p>The 2D/3D construction of hybrid perovskite interfaces is gaining increasing
attention due to their enhanced stability towards degradation without
compromising the corresponding solar cell efficiency. Much of it is due to the
interfacial charge transfer and its consequences on the electronic and optical
response of the composite system, which are instrumental in the context of
stability and efficiency. In this work, we have considered a case study of an
experimentally motivated 2D/3D interface constructed based on Ruddlesden-Popper
phases of (A43)$_2$PbI$_4$ and (A43)$_2$MAPb$_2$I$_7$ hybrid perovskites to
envisage the unique tuning of electronic and optical properties through the
associated charge transfer. The corresponding tuning of the band gap is seen to
be related to a unique charge transfer process between the 2D and 3D
counterparts of the interface mediated from valence to conduction band edges of
the composite. We have found that the optical absorption spectra can also be
tuned by the construction of such a hetero-interface and the emergence of a
unique two-peak step feature on the absorption edge, which is not present in
either the 2D or 3D hybrid perovskites. Formation of the composite is found to
increase the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency for the use of these
materials as solar cells from $\approx$ 24\% for individual components to
$\approx$ 32\% for the composite hetero-structure.

<i>Biswajit Datta</i>
<p>In this thesis we will focus on a particular variant of few-layer graphene --
ABA-stacked trilayer graphene. Bernal (ABA) stacked trilayer graphene (TLG) is
a multiband system consisting of a pair of Dirac-like massless linear bands and
a pair of massive quadratic bands. We have studied the electronic properties of
this system in detail and unfolded many interesting physics problems. The whole
thesis is structured in the following way. In chapter 2 and chapter 3 we
discuss the theoretical ingredients we will need to understand the experimental
data presented in this thesis. Chapter 2 focuses on the band structure of
graphene and few-layer graphene. In chapter 3 we focus on quantum Hall effect
of graphene and few-layer graphene. In chapter 4 we discuss the device
fabrication and characterization. Chapter 5, Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 present
the original works which are published as papers.

<h3>Depth-resolving the redox compensation mechanism in LixNiO2</h3>

<p>The performances of lithium-ion batteries are set by the electrodes materials
capacity to exchange lithium ions and electrons faster and reversibly. To this
goal Ni-rich layered metal oxides, especially LiNiO2, are attractive electrode
candidate to achieve both high voltage and capacities. Despite its
attractiveness, several drawbacks for its industrialization are related to
different form of surface and bulk instabilities. These instabilities are due
to redox process involving the charge transfer between cations and anions.
Therefore, a fundamental understanding based on further experimental evidence
is required to resolve of charge transfer between the cation and anion from the
surface to the bulk in LiNiO2. Herein, we resolve the role of nickel and oxygen
in the charge compensation process in LixNiO2 electrodes from the extreme
surface down to 30 nm by energy-dependent core-level HAXPES supported by ab
initio simulation. We emphasize the central role of oxygen in the bulk charge
compensation mechanism from LiNiO2 to NiO2 due to the negative charge transfer
and bond/charge-disproportionation characters of LiNiO2. This bulk behavior is
in turn responsible for surface deoxygenation and nickel reduction upon
delithiation.

<h3>Interplay between an absorbing phase transition and synchronization in a  driven granular system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12817</a>
<br>
<i>R. Maire, A. Plati, M. Stockinger, E. Trizac, F. Smallenburg, G. Foffi</i>
<p>Absorbing phase transitions (APTs) are widespread in non-equilibrium systems,
spanning condensed matter, epidemics, earthquakes, ecology, and chemical
reactions. APTs feature an absorbing state in which the system becomes
entrapped, along with a transition, either continuous or discontinuous, to an
active state. Understanding which physical mechanisms determine the order of
these transitions represents a challenging open problem in non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics. Here, by numerical simulations and mean-field analysis,
we show that a quasi-2d vibrofluidized granular system exhibits a novel form of
APT. The absorbing phase is observed in the horizontal dynamics below a
critical packing fraction, and can be continuous or discontinuous based on the
emergent degree of synchronization in the vertical motion. Our results provide
a direct representation of a feasible experimental scenario, showcasing a
surprising interplay between dynamic phase transition and synchronization.

<h3>Sublattice-selective percolation on bipartite planar lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonas Wattendorff, Stefan Wessel</i>
<p>In conventional site percolation, all lattice sites are occupied with the
same probability. For a bipartite lattice, sublattice-selective percolation
instead involves two independent occupation probabilities, depending on the
sublattice to which a given site belongs. Here, we determine the corresponding
phase diagram for the two-dimensional square and Lieb lattices from quantifying
the parameter regime where a percolating cluster persists for
sublattice-selective percolation. For this purpose, we present an adapted
Newman-Ziff algorithm. We also consider the critical exponents at the
percolation transition, confirming previous Monte Carlo and
renormalization-group findings that suggest sublattice-selective percolation to
belong to the same universality class as conventional site percolation. To
further strengthen this conclusion, we finally treat sublattice-selective
percolation on the Bethe lattice (infinite Cayley tree) by an exact solution.

<h3>Application of multivariate Tromp functions for evaluating the joint  impact of particle size, shape and wettability on the separation of ultrafine  particles via flotation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12834" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12834</a>
<br>
<i>Johanna Sygusch, Thomas Wilhelm, Orkun Furat, Kai Bachmann, Volker Schmidt, Martin Rudolph</i>
<p>Froth flotation predominantly separates particles according to their
differences in wettability. However, other particle properties such as size,
shape or density significantly influence the separation outcome as well. Froth
flotation is most efficient for particles within a size range of about
$20-200\mu m$, but challenges arise for very fine or coarse particles that are
accompanied by low recoveries and poor selectivity. While the impact of
particle size on the separation behavior in flotation is well-known by now, the
effect of particle shape is less studied and varies based on the investigated
zone (suspension or froth) and the separation apparatus used. A
multidimensional perspective on the separation process, considering multiple
particle properties, enhances the understanding of their collective influence.
In this paper the two-dimensional case is studied, i.e., a parametric modeling
approach is applied to determine bivariate Tromp functions from scanning
electron microscopy-based image data of the feed and the separated fractions.
With these functions it is possible to characterize the separation behavior of
particle systems. Using a model system of ultrafine ($<10\mu m$) particles,
consisting of differently shaped glass particles with different wettability
states as the floatable and magnetite as the non-floatable fraction, allows for
investigating the influence of particle size, shape and wettability, on the
separation. In this way, the present paper contributes to a better
understanding of the complex interplay between certain property vectors for the
case of ultrafine particles. Furthermore, it demonstrates the benefits of using
multivariate Tromp functions for evaluating separation processes, and points
out the limitations of SEM based image measurements by means of mineral
liberation analysis (MLA) for the studied particle size fraction.

<h3>Diagnosing $SO(5)$ Symmetry and First-Order Transition in the $J-Q_3$  Model via Entanglement Entropy</h3>

<br>
<i>Zehui Deng, Lu Liu, Wenan Guo, Hai-qing Lin</i>
<p>We study the scaling behavior of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy with smooth
boundaries at the phase transition point of the two-dimensional $J-Q_3$ model.
Using the recently developed scaling formula [Deng {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B
{\textbf{108}, 125144 (2023)}], we find a subleading logarithmic term with a
coefficient showing that the number of Goldstone modes is four, indicating the
existence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking from an emergent $SO(5)$ to
$O(4)$ in the thermodynamic limit, but restored in a finite size. This result
shows that the believed deconfined quantum critical point of the $J-Q_{3}$
model is a weak first-order transition point. Our work provides a new way to
distinguish a state with spontaneously broken continuous symmetry from a
critical state. The method is particularly useful in identifying weak
first-order phase transitions, which are hard to determine using conventional
methods.

<i>K. Malchow, T. Zellweger, B. Cheng, A. Leray, J. Leuthold, A. Bouhelier</i>
<p>Key pre-synaptic and post-synaptic biological functions have been
successfully implemented in various hardware systems. A noticeable example are
neuronal networks constructed from memristors, which are emulating complex
electro-chemical biological dynamics such a neuron's efficacy and plasticity.
Neurons are highly active cells, communicating with chemical and electrical
stimuli, but also emit light. These photons are suspected to be a complementary
vehicle to transport information across the brain. Here, we show that a
memristor also releases photons akin to the production of neuronal light.
Critical attributes of so-called biophotons such as self-generation, origin,
stochasticity, spectral coverage, sparsity and correlation with the neuron's
activity are replicated by our solid-state approach. Our findings further
extend the emulating capability of a memristor to encompass neuronal biophoton
emission and open the possibility to construct a bimodal electro-optical
platform with the assistance of atomic-scale devices capable of handling
electrons and photons as information carriers.

<h3>Dehydration drives damage in the freezing of brittle hydrogels</h3>

<br>
<i>Shaohua Yang, Dominic Gerber, Yanxia Feng, Nicolas Bain, Matthias Kuster, Laura de Lorenzis, Ye Xu, Eric R. Dufresne, Robert W. Style</i>
<p>It is widely known that freezing breaks soft, wet materials. However, the
mechanism underlying this damage is still not clear. To understand this
process, we freeze model, brittle hydrogel samples, while observing the growth
of ice-filled cracks that break these apart. We show that damage is not caused
by the expansion of water upon freezing, or the growth of ice-filled cavities
in the hydrogel. Instead, local ice growth dehydrates the surrounding hydrogel,
leading to drying-induced fracture. This dehydration is driven by the process
of cryosuction, whereby undercooled ice sucks nearby water towards itself,
feeding its growth. Our results highlight the strong analogy between freezing
damage and desiccation cracking, which we anticipate being useful for
developing an understanding of both topics. Our results should also give useful
insights into a wide range of freezing processes, including cryopreservation,
food science and frost heave.

<i>Balaram Thakur, Xuejun Gong, Andrea Dal Corso</i>
<p>The high-pressure and high-temperature thermodynamic properties of iridium
are studied using density functional theory in combination with the
quasi-harmonic approximation, where both the contributions to the free energy
of phonons and of electronic excitations are considered. The reliability of
different exchange and correlational functionals [Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
generalized gradient approximation (PBE) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 77,
3865 (1996)), PBE modified for dense solids (PBEsol) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev.
B 100, 136406 (2008)) and local density approximation (LDA) (Perdew et al.
Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981))], for studying the equation of state (EOS), the
phonon dispersions, the mode-Gr\"uneisen parameter, and different thermodynamic
properties like thermal pressure, volume thermal expansivity, isobaric heat
capacity, bulk modulus, and the average Gr\"uneisen parameter are tested.
Elastic constants are studied at T=0 K as a function of pressure. The predicted
results are compared with the available experiments and previous theoretical
data. We find generally a good agreement with experiments with at least one
functional, but none of the three outperforms the others in all the
investigated thermodynamic properties. The electronic excitations contribution
is minimal in bulk modulus, but it is significant for other thermodynamic
properties.

<h3>Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases as a material platform for  altermagnetism</h3>

<br>
<i>F. Bernardini, M. Fiebig, A. Cano</i>
<p>The subclass of collinear antiferromagnets where spin Kramers degeneracy is
broken -- so that they can display ferromagnetic-like properties -- stimulates
a new perspective in magnetism. However, the material base for these so-called
altermagnets is still relatively limited. We show that Ruddlesden-Popper and
perovskite phases generically host altermagnetic materials. In particular, we
analyze prototypical nickel-based systems via first-principles calculations and
identify additional materials from their crystal structure and magnetic orders.
These materials span both insulating/semiconducting and metallic conduction
types and the computed values of the nonrelativistic spin splittings reach
250~meV. Our analysis also indicates some formal inconsistencies that may
appear within the traditional classification of magnetically ordered materials,
which can easily be resolved from the altermagnetic perspective. In addition,
we indicate the possibility of having altermagnetic behavior in systems beyond
collinear antiferromagnets with perfectly compensated magnetization.

<h3>Thermal transport of Li$_3$PS$_4$ solid electrolytes with ab initio  accuracy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12936" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12936</a>
<br>
<i>Davide Tisi, Federico Grasselli, Lorenzo Gigli, Michele Ceriotti</i>
<p>The vast amount of computational studies on electrical conduction in solid
state electrolytes is not mirrored by comparable efforts addressing thermal
conduction, which has been scarcely investigated despite its relevance to
thermal management and (over)heating of batteries. The reason for this lies in
the complexity of the calculations: on one hand, the diffusion of ionic charge
carriers makes lattice methods formally unsuitable, due to the lack of
equilibrium atomic positions needed for normal-mode expansion. On the other
hand, the prohibitive cost of large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of heat transport in large systems at \textit{ab initio} levels has hindered
the use of MD-based methods. In this work, we leverage recently developed
machine-learning potentials targeting different \textit{ab initio} functionals
(PBEsol, r$^2$SCAN, PBE0) and a state-of-the-art formulation of the Green-Kubo
theory of heat transport in multicomponent systems to compute the thermal
conductivity of a promising solid-state-electrolyte, Li$_3$PS$_4$,~in all its
polymorphs ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$). By comparing MD estimates with
lattice methods on the low-temperature, non-diffusive $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$, we
highlight strong anharmonicities and negligible nuclear quantum effects, hence
further justifying MD-based methods even for non diffusive phases. Finally, for
the ion-conducting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, where the multicomponent
Green-Kubo MD approach is mandatory, our simulations indicate a weak
temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, a glass-like behavior due
to the effective local disorder characterizing these Li-diffusing phases.

<p>Systems with engineered flatband spectra are a postulate of high-capacity
transmission links and a candidate for high-temperature superconductivity.
However, their operation relies on the edge or surface modes susceptible to
fluctuations and fabrication errors. While the mode robustness can be enhanced
by a combination of Aharonov-Bohm caging and topological insulation, the design
of the corresponding flatbands requires approaches beyond the standard
$k$-vector-based methods. Here, we propose a synthetic-flux probe as a solution
to this problem and a route to the realization of ultra-stable modes. We prove
the concept in a laser-fabricated graphene-like ribbon photonic lattice with
the band-flattening flux induced by "P" waveguide coupling. The topological
non-triviality is witnessed by an integer Zak phase derived from the mean
chiral displacement. Mode stability is evidenced by excellent mode localization
and the robustness to fabrication tolerances and variations of the input phase.
Our results can serve as a basis for the development of multi-flat-band
materials for low-energy electronics.
