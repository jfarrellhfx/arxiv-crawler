<h3>Scaling transition of active turbulence from two to three dimensions</h3>

Turbulent flows are observed in low-Reynolds active fluids. They are
intrinsically different from the classical inertial turbulence and behave
distinctively in two- and three-dimensions. Understanding the behaviors of this
new type of turbulence and their dependence on the system dimensionality is a
fundamental challenge in non-equilibrium physics. We experimentally measure
flow structures and energy spectra of bacterial turbulence between two large
parallel plates spaced by different heights $H$. The turbulence exhibits three
regimes as H increases, resulting from the competition of bacterial length,
vortex size and H. This is marked by two critical heights ($H_0$ and $H_1$) and
a $H^{0.5}$ scaling law of vortex size in the large-$H$ limit. Meanwhile, the
spectra display distinct universal scaling laws in quasi-two-dimensional (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) regimes, independent of bacterial activity, length
and $H$, whereas scaling exponents exhibit transitions in the crossover. To
understand the scaling laws, we develop a hydrodynamic model using image
systems to represent the effect of no-slip confining boundaries. This model
predicts universal 1 and -4 scaling on large and small length scales,
respectively, and -2 and -1 on intermediate length scales in 2D and 3D,
respectively, which are consistent with the experimental results. Our study
suggests a framework for investigating the effect of dimensionality on
non-equilibrium self-organized systems.

The underlying mechanisms and physics of catalytic Janus microswimmers is
highly complex, requiring details of the associated phoretic fields and the
physiochemical properties of catalyst, particle, boundaries, and the fuel used.
Therefore, developing a minimal (and more general) model capable of capturing
the overall dynamics of these autonomous particles is highly desirable. In the
presented work, we demonstrate that a coarse-grained dissipative
particle-hydrodynamics model is capable of describing the behaviour of various
chemical microswimmer systems. Specifically, we show how a competing balance
between hydrodynamic interactions experienced by a squirmer in the presence of
a substrate, gravity, and mass and shape asymmetries can reproduce a range of
dynamics seen in different experimental systems. We hope that our general model
will inspire further synthetic work where various modes of swimmer motion can
be encoded via shape and mass during fabrication, helping to realise the still
outstanding goal of microswimmers capable of complex 3-D behaviour

<h3>Rheology of Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms: from experiments to  predictive DPD mesoscopic modelling</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bacterial biofilms mechanically behave as viscoelastic media consisting of
micron-sized bacteria crosslinked to a selfproduced network of extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) embedded in water. Structural principles for
numerical modelling aim at describing mesoscopic viscoelasticity without
loosing detail on the underlying interactions existing in wide regimes of
deformation under hydrodynamic stress. Here we approach the computational
challenge to model bacterial biofilms for predictive mechanics in silico under
variable stress conditions. Up-to-date models are not entirely satisfactory due
to the plethora of parameters required to make them functioning under the
effects of stress. As guided by the structural depiction gained in a previous
work with Pseudomonas fluorescens (Jara et al. Front. Microbiol. (2021)), we
propose a mechanical modeling by means of Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD),
which captures the essentials of the topological and compositional interactions
between bacteria particles and crosslinked EPS-embedding under imposed shear.
The P. fluorescens biofilms have been modeled under mechanical stress mimicking
shear stresses as undergone in vitro. The predictive capacity for mechanical
features in DPD-simulated biofilms has been investigated by varying the
externally imposed field of shear strain at variable amplitude and frequency.
The parametric map of essential biofilm ingredients has been explored by making
the rheological responses to emerge among conservative mesoscopic interactions
and frictional dissipation in the underlying microscale. The proposed coarse
grained DPD simulation qualitatively catches the rheology of the P. fluorescens
biofilm over several decades of dynamic scaling.

<h3>Selective Manipulation and Tunneling Spectroscopy of Broken-Symmetry  Quantum Hall States in a Hybrid-edge Quantum Point Contact</h3>

We present a device architecture of hybrid-edge and dual-gated quantum point
contact. We demonstrate improved electrostatic control over the separation,
position, and coupling of each broken-symmetry compressible strip in graphene.
Via low-temperature magneto-transport measurement, we demonstrate selective
manipulation over the evolution, hybridization, and transmission of arbitrarily
chosen quantum Hall states in the channel. With gate-tunable tunneling
spectroscopy, we characterize the energy gap of each symmetry-broken quantum
Hall state with high resolution on the order of ~0.1 meV.

<h3>Dynamical Variational Monte Carlo as a quantum impurity solver:  Application to Cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</h3>

Two of the primary sources of error in the Cluster dynamical mean-field
theory (CDMFT) technique arise from the use of finite size clusters and finite
size baths, which makes the development of impurity solvers that can treat
larger systems an essential goal. In this work we introduce an impurity solver
based on the recently developed dynamical variational Monte Carlo (dVMC)
method. Variational Monte Carlo possesses a favorable scaling as a function of
system size, which enables the treatment of systems beyond the reach of current
exact diagonalization solvers. To benchmark the technique, we perform a
systematic set of CDMFT calculations on the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We
compare to results obtained with an exact diagonalization solver for small
clusters, and against the exact solution in the thermodynamic limit obtained by
Lieb and Wu for larger clusters. The development of improved impurity solvers
will help extend the reach of quantum cluster methods, which can be applied to
a wide range of strongly-correlated electron systems, promising new insights on
their emergent behavior.

<h3>A Geometric Mapping from Rectilinear Material Orthotropy to Isotropy:  Insights to Plates and Shells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15746" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15746</a>

Orthotropic shell structures are ubiquitous in biology and engineering, from
bacterial cell walls to reinforced domes. We present a rescaling transformation
that maps an orthotropic shallow shell to an isotropic one with a different
local geometry. The mapping is applicable to any shell section for which the
material orthotropy directions match the principal curvature directions,
assuming a commonly used form for the orthotropic shear modulus. Using the
rescaling transformation, we derive exact expressions for the buckling pressure
as well as the linear indentation response of orthotropic cylinders and general
ellipsoids of revolution, which we verify against numerical simulations. Our
analysis disentangles the separate contributions of geometric and material
anisotropy to shell rigidity. In particular, we identify the geometric mean of
orthotropic elastic constants as the key quantifier of material stiffness,
playing a role akin to the Gaussian curvature which captures the geometric
stiffness contribution. Besides providing insights into the mechanical response
of orthotropic shells, our work rigorously establishes the validity of
isotropic approximations to orthotropic shells and also identifies situations
in which these approximations might fail.

<h3>Magnetic Antiskyrmions in Two-Dimensional van der Waals Magnets  Engineered by Layer Stacking</h3>

Magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions are topologically protected
quasiparticles exhibiting a whirling spin texture in real space. Antiskyrmions
offer some advantages over skyrmions as they are expected to have higher
stability and can be electrically driven with no transverse motion. However,
unlike the widely investigated skyrmions, antiskyrmions are rarely observed due
to the required anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Here we
propose to exploit the recently demonstrated van der Waals (vdW) assembly of
two-dimensional (2D) materials that breaks inversion symmetry and creates
conditions for anisotropic DMI. Using a 2D vdW magnet CrI${}_3$ as an example,
we demonstrate, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, that
this strategy is a promising platform to realize antiskyrmions. Polar layer
stacking of two centrosymmetric magnetic monolayers of CrI${}_3$ efficiently
lowers the symmetry, resulting in anisotropic DMI that supports antiskyrmions.
The DMI is reversible by switching the ferroelectric polarization inherited
from the polar layer stacking, offering the control of antiskyrmions by an
electric field. Furthermore, we find that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and
DMI of CrI${}_3$ can be efficiently modulated by Mn doping, creating a
possibility to control the size of antiskyrmions. Using atomistic spin dynamics
simulations with the parameters obtained from our DFT calculations, we predict
the formation of antiskyrmions in a Cr${}_{0.88}$Mn${}_{0.12}$I${}_3$ bilayer
and switching their spin texture with polarization reversal. Our results open a
new direction to generate and control magnetic antiskyrmions in 2D vdW magnetic
systems.

Superconducting (SC) state has spin and orbital degrees of freedom, and
spin-triplet superconductivity shows multiple SC phases due to the presence of
these degrees of freedom. However, the observation of spin-direction rotation
occurring inside the SC state (SC spin rotation) has hardly been reported.
UTe2, a recently discovered topological superconductor, exhibits various SC
phases under pressure: SC state at ambient pressure (SC1), high-temperature SC
state above 0.5 GPa (SC2), and low-temperature SC state above 0.5 GPa (SC3). We
performed nuclear magnetic resonance and AC susceptibility measurements on
single-crystal UTe2. The b-axis spin susceptibility remains unchanged in SC2,
unlike in SC1, and decreases below the SC2-SC3 transition with spin modulation.
These unique properties in SC3 arise from the coexistence of two SC order
parameters. Our NMR results confirm the spin-triplet superconductivity with SC
spin parallel to b in SC2, and unveil the remaining of spin degrees of freedom
in superconducting UTe2.

<h3>Accurate Vertical Nanoelectromechanical Measurements</h3>

Driven by smaller dimensions in micro and nanoelectronics, there has been a
rapid expansion of research on thin film ferroelectric materials including
Hafnia oxides and layered van der Waals ferroelectrics. These materials
commonly have inverse piezo coefficients that are small, of order 1pm/volt. The
recent advent of weaker materials has accelerated the reporting of strange
ferroelectrics, meaning materials that are mistakenly interpreted as
ferroelectric. We previously proposed that use of an interferometric
displacement sensor (IDS), with the detector spot positioned above the tip of
the cantilever was an electrostatic force blind spot that allowed artifact-free
measurements of the out of plane converse piezo-sensitivity. Recently, an
additional blind spot was proposed for the more commonly available optical beam
deflection (OBD) at a location approximately 60% between the base and tip of
the cantilever. We performed automated, sub-resonance PFM measurements on
periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) and observed that the IDS blind spot
was consistently located above the cantilever tip while the simultaneously
acquired OBD blind spot location was highly variable. We hypothesize that this
variability is due to the much higher sensitivity of the OBD blind spot to
changes in longitudinal and electrostatic forces. We found that for OBD
detection the combination of unknown out of plane and in-plane piezoresponse,
long-range electrostatic interactions and uncontrolled and unknown in-plane
tip-sample mechanical forces leads to difficulties in both identifying and
staying at the OBD blind spot as well as systematic, position-dependent errors.
In contrast, IDS measurements with the laser spot above the tip are relatively
insensitive to these complications, enabling precise measurements of the
vertical piezoresponse.

We report a study of selenospinel Cu$_{6-x}$Fe$_{4+x}$Sn$_{12}$Se$_{32}$ ($x$
= 0, 1, 2) single crystals, which crystalize in a cubic structure with the
$Fd\overline{3}m$ space group, and show typical semiconducting behavior. The
large discrepancy between the activation energy for electrical conductivity
$E_\rho$ (32.3 $\sim$ 69.8 meV), and for thermopower $E_\textrm{S}$ (3.2 $\sim$
11.5 meV), indicates a polaronic transport mechanism between 350 and 50 K. With
decreasing temperature, it evolves into variable-range hopping conduction.
Furthermore, the heat capacity shows a hump around 25(5) K and diverges from
the Debye $T^3$ law at low temperatures, indicating the observation of
structural glassy features in these crystalline solids.

<br>
<br>
Systems with flat bands are ideal for studying strongly correlated electronic
states and related phenomena. Among them, kagome-structured metals such as CoSn
have been recognized as promising candidates due to the proximity between the
flat bands and the Fermi level. A key next step will be to realize epitaxial
kagome thin films with flat bands to enable tuning of the flat bands across the
Fermi level via electrostatic gating or strain. Here we report the band
structures of epitaxial CoSn thin films grown directly on insulating
substrates. Flat bands are observed using synchrotron-based angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The band structure is consistent with
density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and the transport properties are
quantitatively explained by the band structure and semiclassical transport
theory. Our work paves the way to realize flat band-induced phenomena through
fine-tuning of flat bands in kagome materials.

Gigahertz acoustic resonators have the potential to advance data processing
and quantum communication. However, they are expensive and lack responsiveness
to external stimuli, limiting their use in sensing applications. In contrast,
low-cost nanoscale mesoporous materials, known for their high surface-to-volume
ratio, have shown promise in various applications. We recently demonstrated
that mesoporous silicon dioxide (SiO2) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin layers
can support coherent acoustic modes in the 5 to 100 GHz range. In this study,
we propose a new method for designing tunable acoustic resonators using
mesoporous thin films on acoustic distributed Bragg reflectors. By infiltrating
the pores with different chemicals, the material's properties could be altered
and achieve tunability in the acoustic resonances. We present four device
designs and use simulations to predict resonators with Q-factors up to 1000. We
also observe that the resonant frequency and intensity show a linear response
to relative humidity, with a tunability of up to 60 %. Our platform offers a
unique opportunity to design cost-effective nanoacoustic sensing and
reconfigurable optoacoustic nanodevices.

<h3>Application of murexide as a capping agent for fabrication of magnetite  anodes for supercapacitors: experimental and first-principle studies</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of murexide for surface
modification of Fe$_3$O$_4$ nanoparticles to enhance the performance of
multi-walled carbon nanotube-Fe$_3$O$_4$ supercapacitor anodes. Our
experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in electrode
performance when murexide is used as a capping or dispersing agent compared to
the case with no additives. When murexide is used as a capping agent, we report
a capacitance of 4.2 F cm$^{-2}$ from cyclic voltammetry analysis with good
capacitance retention at high scan rate. From impedance measurements, we reveal
a substantial decrease in the real part of impedance for samples prepared with
murexide, indicating easier charge transfer at more negative electrode
potentials, and reinforcing the role of murexide as a capping agent and charge
transfer mediator. Density functional theory is used to investigate
interactions between the murexide adsorbate and the Fe$_3$O$_4$ (001) surface,
with a specific emphasis on adsorption strength, charge transfer, and
electronic properties. This theoretical investigation uncovers a strong
adsorption enthalpy of -4.5 eV, and allows us to identify the nature of
chemical bonds between murexide and the surface, with significant charge
transfer taking place between the Fe$_3$O$_4$ surface and murexide adsorbate.
The transfer of electrons from the Fe$_3$O$_4$ surface to murexide is
recognized as a vital component of the adsorption process. By examining the
bonding nature of murexide on Fe$_3$O$_4$, this research study uncovers
insights and proposes a novel bonding configuration of murexide that
incorporates a combination of bridging and chelating bonding.

<h3>Evidence for Two Dimensional Anisotropic Luttinger Liquids at  Millikelvin Temperatures</h3>

<br>
<br>
While Landau's Fermi liquid theory provides the standard description for two-
and three-dimensional (2D/3D) conductors, the physics of interacting
one-dimensional (1D) conductors is governed by the distinct Luttinger liquid
(LL) theory. Can a LL-like state, in which electronic excitations are
fractionalized modes, emerge in a 2D system as a stable zero-temperature phase?
This long-standing question, first brought up by Anderson decades ago, is
crucial in the study of non-Fermi liquids but remains unsettled. A recent
experiment identified a moir\'e superlattice of twisted bilayer tungsten
ditelluride (tWTe_2) with a small interlayer twist angle as a 2D host of the LL
physics at temperatures of a few kelvins. Here we report experimental evidence
for a 2D anisotropic LL state in a substantially reduced temperature regime,
down to at least 50 mK, spontaneously formed in a tWTe_2 system with a twist
angle of ~ 3 degree. While the system is metallic-like and nearly isotropic
above 2 K, a dramatically enhanced electronic anisotropy develops in the
millikelvin regime, featuring distinct transport behaviors along two orthogonal
in-plane directions. In the strongly anisotropic phase, we observe transport
characteristics of a 2D LL phase, i.e., the universal power law scaling
behaviors in across-wire conductance and a zero-bias dip in the differential
resistance along the wire direction. Our results represent a step forward in
the search for stable LL physics beyond 1D and related unconventional quantum
matter.

<h3>Spatial inversion symmetry breaking of vortex current in biased-ladder  superfluid</h3>

<br>

We investigate the quench dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder
in presence of a uniform Abelian gauge field. The model hosts a variety of
emergent quantum phases, and we focus on the superfluid biased-ladder phase
breaking the $Z_{2}$ symmetry of two legs. We observe an asymmetric spreading
of vortex current and particle density, i.e., the current behaves particle-like
on the right and wave-like on the left, indicating spontaneous breaking of the
spatial inversion symmetry. By decreasing the repulsion strength, it is found
the particle-like current is more robust than the wave-like one. The evolution
of entanglement entropy manifests logarithmic growth with time suggesting
many-body localization matters.

<h3>Entropic selection in frustrated magnets: ordering on self-intersecting  spaces</h3>

<br>

Frustrated magnets typically possess a large space of classical ground
states. If this degeneracy is not protected by symmetry, thermal fluctuations
may 'select' certain states via order-by-disorder. We examine the role of
geometry in this mechanism in the context of classical magnets. We consider two
model magnetic clusters, each with four spins coupled by XY interactions. In
the first, the classical ground states form a smooth space. In the second, they
form a self-intersecting non-manifold space. State selection is very different
in these two cases. We first consider the microcanonical ensemble picture,
where fluctuations conserve energy. Phase space arguments suggest that the
first model samples the set of classical ground states with energy-independent
probabilities. The second shows a dramatic energy-dependence with relative
probability increasing as $\epsilon^{-1/2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the energy of
the system. We simulate low-energy dynamics in both models, confirming the
expected behaviour. We next consider the canonical ensemble, where the first
model produces temperature-independent probabilities. In the second, relative
probability rises sharply as $T^{-1/2}$, where $T$ is the temperature. Our
results bring out a classical analogue of order-by-singularity, a mechanism
that has been recently proposed in the context of quantum spin clusters. State
selection is qualitatively different in systems with self-intersecting ground
state spaces. It grows at low energies and becomes perfect as $\epsilon
\rightarrow 0$ (microcanonical ensemble) or $T\rightarrow 0$ (canonical
ensemble). We discuss relevance for ordering in various macroscopic magnets.

An effective action for the bulk dynamics of quantum Hall effect in arbitrary
even spatial dimensions was obtained some time ago in terms of a Chern-Simons
term associated with the Dolbeault index theorem. Here we explore further
properties of this action, showing how electronic band structures can be
incorporated, obtaining Hall currents and conductivity (for arbitrary
dimensions) in terms of integrals of Chern classes for the bands. We also
derive the expression for Hall viscosity from the effective action. Explicit
formulae for the Hall viscosity are given for 2+1 and 4+1dimensions.

<h3>Charge-Spin Conversion in Two-Subband Quantum Wells with Conventional  and Unconventional Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h3>

The reciprocal interconversion between spin polarization and charge current
(CSC) is the focus of intensive theoretical and experimental investigation in
spintronics research. Its physical origin stems from the Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) induced by the breaking of the structure inversion symmetry. The
steady-state interconversion efficiency is the result of the non-trivial spin
textures of the electric-field distorted Fermi surface. Its full understanding
and evaluation requires the consideration of disorder-induced relaxation
effects in the presence of spin-orbit induced band splitting. In this paper the
additional effect of the orbital degree of freedom is analyzed in a two-subband
quantum well with both conventional and unconventional Rashba SOC in the
presence of disorder impurity scattering. The latter is treated at the level of
the Born approximation in the Green's function self-energy and with the
inclusion of vertex corrections in the linear response functions for the charge
current and the spin polarization. By explicitly considering the symmetry
properties of the Hamiltonian the matrix structure of the correlation functions
is shown to decompose in independent blocks of symmetry-related physical
observables. We find that the inclusion of vertex corrections is important for
the correct estimate of the CSC efficiency, which also depends on the position
of the Fermi level. We also find that the relative sign of the Rashba SOC in
the two subbands plays a key role in determining the behavior of the CSC.
Finally, we point out how the two-subband model compares with the standard
single-band two-dimensional electron gas.

Chiral phonons have attracted increasing attention, as they play important
roles in many different systems and processes. However, a method to control
phonon chirality by external fields is still lacking. Here, we propose that in
displacement-type ferroelectric materials, an external electric field can
reverse the chirality of chiral phonons via ferroelectric switching. Using
first-principles calculations, we demonstrate this point in the well known
two-dimensional ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$. This reversal may lead to a number
of electrically switchable phenomena, such as chiral phonon induced
magnetization, phonon Hall effect, and possible interface phonon modes at
ferroelectric domain boundaries. Our work offers a new way to control chiral
phonons, which could be useful for the design of thermal or information devices
based on them.

Considering low-energy model of tilted Weyl semimetal, we study the
electronic transmission through a periodically driven quantum well, oriented in
the transverse direction with respect to the tilt. We adopt the formalism of
Floquet scattering theory and investigate the emergence of Fano resonances as
an outcome of matching between the Floquet sidebands and quasi-bound states.
The Fano resonance energy changes linearly with the tilt strength suggesting
the fact that tilt-mediated part of quasi-bound states energies depends on the
above factor. Given a value of momentum parallel (perpendicular) to the tilt,
we find that the energy gap between two Fano resonances, appearing for two
adjacent values of transverse (collinear) momentum with respect to the tilt
direction, is insensitive (sensitive) to the change in the tilt strength. Such
a coupled (decoupled) behavior of tilt strength and the collinear (transverse)
momentum can be understood from the tilt-mediated and normal parts of the
quasi-bound state energies inside the potential well. We vary the other tilt
parameters and chirality of the Weyl points to conclusively verify exact form
of the tilt-mediated part of the quasi-bound state energy that is the same as
the tilt term in the static dispersion. Our work paves the way to probe the
tilt-mediated part of quasi-bound state energy for understanding the complex
interplay between the tilt and Fano resonance.

<h3>Active and passive microrheology with large tracers in hard colloids</h3>

The dynamics of a tracer particle in a bath of quasi-hard colloidal spheres
is studied by Langevin dynamics simulations and mode coupling theory (MCT); the
tracer radius is varied from equal to up to 7 times larger than the bath
particles radius. In the simulations, two cases are considered: freely
diffusing tracer (passive microrheology) and tracer pulled with a constant
force (active microrheology). Both cases are connected by linear response
theory for all tracer sizes. It links both the stationary and transient regimes
of the pulled tracer (for low forces) with the equilibrium correlation
functions; the velocity of the pulled tracer and its displacement are obtained
from the velocity auto-correlation function and the mean squared displacement,
respectively. The MCT calculations give insight into the physical mechanisms:
At short times, the tracer rattles in its cage of neighbours, with the
frequency increasing linearly with the tracer radius asymptotically. The
long-time tracer diffusion coefficient from passive microrheology, which agrees
with the inverse friction coefficient from the active case, arises from the
transport of transverse momentum around the tracer. It can be described with
the Brinkman equation for the transverse flow field obtained in extension of
MCT, but cannot be recovered from the MCT kernel coupling to densities only.
The dynamics of the bath particles is also studied; for the unforced tracer the
dynamics is unaffected, irrespective of the distance from the tracer. When the
tracer is pulled, the velocity field in the bath decays with the distance from
the tracer as 1/r3, as predicted by the Brinkman model, but different from the
case of a Newtonian fluid.

<h3>Unconventional optical response in monolayer graphene upon dominant  intraband scattering</h3>

Scattering kinetics influence the graphene transport properties and inhibits
the charge carrier deterministic behaviour. The intra or inter-band scattering
mechanisms are vital for graphenes optical conductivity response under specific
considerations of doping. Here, we investigated the influence of scattering
systematically on optical conductivity using the multiband semi-classical
Boltzmann equation with inclusion of both electron-electron $\&$
electron-phonon collisions. We found unconventional characteristics of linear
optical response with a significant deviation from the universal conductivity
$\frac{e$^2$}{2$\hbar$}$ in doped monolayer graphene. This is examined through
phenomenological relaxation rates under low doping regimes and found that the
dominance of intraband scattering. Such novel optical responses are vanished at
high temperatures or overdoping conditions due to strong Drude behaviour. With
the aid of approximations around Dirac points we have developed formalism for
many body interactions and found which is in good agreement with the Kubo
approaches.

Jammed granular media and glasses exhibit spatial long-range correlations as
a result of mechanical equilibrium. However, the existence of such correlations
in the flowing matter, where the mechanical equilibrium is unattainable, has
remained elusive. Here, we investigate this problem in the context of the
percolation of interparticle forces in flowing granular media. We find that the
flow rate introduces an effective long-range correlation, which plays the role
of a relevant perturbation giving rise to a spectrum of varying exponents on a
critical line as a function of the flow rate. Remarkably, our numerical
simulations along with analytical arguments predict a crossover flow rate
$\dot{\gamma}_c \simeq 10^{-5}$ below which the effect of induced disorder is
weak and the universality of the force chain structure is shown to be given by
the standard rigidity percolation. We also find a power-law behavior for the
critical exponents with the flow rate $\dot{\gamma}>\dot{\gamma}_c$.

The piecewise linearity condition on the total energy with respect to total
magnetization of open quantum systems is derived, using the
infinite-separation-limit technique. This generalizes the well known constancy
condition, related to static correlation error, in approximate density
functional theory (DFT). The magnetic analog of the DFT Koopmans theorem is
also derived. Moving to fractional electron count, the tilted plane condition
is derived, lifting certain assumptions in previous works. This generalization
of the flat plane condition characterizes the total energy curve of a finite
system for all values of electron count N and magnetization M. This result is
used in combination with tabulated spectroscopic data to show the flat
plane-structure of the oxygen atom, as an example. A diverse set of tilted
plane structures is shown to occur in d-orbital subspaces, depending on their
chemical coordination. General occupancy-based expressions for total energies
are demonstrated thereby to be necessarily dependent on the symmetry-imposed
degeneracies.

In many colloidal suspensions, the dispersed colloidal particles are
amorphous solids resulting from vitrification. A crucial open problem is
understanding how colloidal stability is affected by the intra-particle glass
transition. By dealing with the latter process from a solid-state perspective,
we estabilish a proportionality relation between the intra-particle glass
transition temperature, $T_{\textrm{g}},$ and the Hamaker constant,
$A_\textrm{H},$ of a generic suspension of nanoparticles. It follows that
$T_\textrm{g}$ can be used as a convenient parameter (alternative to
$A_\textrm{H}$) for controlling the stability of colloidal systems. Within DLVO
theory, we show that the novel relationship, connecting $T_\textrm{g}$ to
$A_\textrm{H},$ implies the critical coagulation ionic strength (CCIS) to be a
monotonically decreasing function of $T_{\textrm{g}}.$ We connect our
predictions to recent experimental findings.

Based on our first detailed $^{181}$Ta nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR)
studies from 2017 on the Weyl semimetal TaP, we now extended our NQR studies to
another Ta-based monopnictide TaAs. In the present work, we have determined the
temperature-dependent $^{181}$Ta-NQR spectra, the spin-lattice relaxation time
$T_{1}$, and the spin-spin relaxation time $T_{2}$. We found the following
characteristic features that showed great contrast to what was found in TaP:
(1) The quadrupole coupling constant and asymmetry parameter of EFG, extracted
from three NQR frequencies, have a strong temperature dependence above $\sim$80
K that cannot be explained by the density functional theory calculation
incorporating the thermal expansion of the lattice. (2) The temperature
dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_{1} T$, shows a $T^{4}$
power law behavior above $\sim$30 K. This is a great contrast with the $1/T_{1}
T \propto T^{2}$ behavior found in TaP, which was ascribed to the magnetic
excitations at the Weyl nodes with a temperature-dependent orbital hyperfine
coupling. (3) Regarding the nuclear spin-spin interaction, we found the
spin-echo signal decays with the pulse separation simply by a Lorentzian
function in TaAs, but we have observed spin-echo modulations in TaP that is
most likely due to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling via virtually
excited Weyl fermions. From our experimental findings, we conclude that the
present NQR results do not show dominant contributions from Weyl fermion
excitations in TaAs.

Ex-so-tic van der Waals heterostructures take advantage of the electrically
tunable layer polarization to swap proximity exchange and spin-orbit coupling
in the electronically active region. Perhaps the simplest example is Bernal
bilayer graphene (BBG) encapsulated by a layered magnet from one side and a
strong spin-orbit material from the other. Taking WS$_2$/BBG/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$
as a representative ex-so-tronic device, we employ realistic \emph{ab
initio}-inspired Hamiltonians and effective electron-electron interactions to
investigate the emergence of correlated phases within the random phase
approximation. We find that for a given doping level, exchange and spin-orbit
coupling induced Stoner and intervalley coherence instabilities can be swapped,
allowing to explore the full spectrum of correlated phases within a single
device.

Weak Mott regime with finite U is a wonderful region to search for quantum
spin liquid, but it is challenging to write down a wavefunction capturing both
spin liquid and charge fluctuations. Conventional methods using complicated
Jastrow factors have difficulties when the underlying spin liquid has a
non-trivial projective symmetry group (PSG). To cure this problem, here we
provide a new class wavefunction for Mott insulator through quantum
teleportation using ancilla qubits. We primarily focus on half filling of the
fermionic Hubbard model. We will prove that a single variation parameter $\Phi$
in our wavefunction tunes the Mott charge gap continuously. On a generic
lattice, we show that the wavefunction at $\Phi=+\infty$ recovers the familiar
Gutzwiller projectived wavefunction at infinite U. The wavefunction at
$\Phi=\frac{U}{2}$ is equivalent to applying the inverse Schrieffer Wolff
transformation at linear order of $t/U$, as expected in large but finite U
regime. From a gauge theory description we can show that the wavefunction has
an electronic sector decoupled from a spinon sector describing localized spin
moments. The charge gap $\Delta_c$ can be shown to be $2\Phi$ and we conjecture
that the wavefunction works well down to the regime with small charge gap on a
generic lattice. We represent the wavefunction using tensor network and
numerically confirm this conjecture in one dimension. Beyond the numerical
power, the ancilla wavefunction also provides a new conceptual picture to
understand the bandwidth tuned metal insulator transition. In this new
framework, there can in principle exist a narrow region of fractional Fermi
liquid (FL*) phase between the usual Fermi liquid and the Mott insulator, a
scenario which is not captured by the conventional slave rotor theory and thus
was usually outlooked.

Recently, Lee et al. reported the experimental discovery of room-temperature
ambient-pressure superconductivity in a Cu-doped lead-apatite (LK-99)
(arXiv:2307.12008, arXiv:2307.12037). Remarkably, the superconductivity
persists up to 400 K at ambient pressure. Despite strong experimental evidence,
the electronic structure of LK-99 has not yet been studied. Here, we
investigate the electronic structures of LK-99 and its parent compound using
first-principles calculations, aiming to elucidate the doping effects of Cu.
Our results reveal that the parent compound Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is an
insulator, while Cu doping induces an insulator-metal transition and thus
volume contraction. The band structures of LK-99 around the Fermi level are
featured by a half-filled flat band and a fully-occupied flat band. These two
flat bands arise from both the $2p$ orbitals of $1/4$-occupied O atoms and the
hybridization of the $3d$ orbitals of Cu with the $2p$ orbitals of its
nearest-neighboring O atoms. Interestingly, we observe four van Hove
singularities on these two flat bands, indicating electronic instability
towards structural distortions at low temperatures. Furthermore, we show that
the band energies of the van Hove singularities can be tuned by including
electronic correlation effects or doping with different elements. We find that
among the considered doping elements (Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, and Au), both Ni and Zn
doping result in the gap opening, whereas Au exhibits doping effects more
similar to Cu than Ag. Our work provides a foundation for future studies on the
role of unique electronic structures of LK-99 in superconductivity.

Exergy represents the maximum useful work possible when a system at a
specific state reaches equilibrium with the environmental dead state at
temperature To. Correspondingly, the exergy difference between two states is
the maximum work output when the system changes from one state to the other,
assuming that during the processes, the system exchanges heat reversibly with
the environment. If the process involves irreversibility, the Guoy-Stodola
theorem states that the exergy destruction equals the entropy generated during
the process multiplied by To. The exergy concept and the Gouy-Stodola theorem
are widely used to optimize processes or systems, even when they are not
directly connected to the environment. In the past, questions have been raised
on if To is the proper temperature to use in calculating the exergy
destruction. Here, we start from the first and the second laws of
thermodynamics to unambiguously show that the useful energy loss (UEL) of a
system or process should equal to the entropy generation multiplied by an
equivalent temperature associated with the entropy rejected out of the entire
system. For many engineering systems and processes, this entropy rejection
temperature can be easily calculated as the ratio of the changes of the
enthalpy and entropy of the fluid stream carrying the entropy out, which we
call the state-change temperature. The UEL is unambiguous and independent of
the environmental dead state, and it should be used for system optimization
rather than the exergy destruction.

<h3>Interfacial cooling and heating, temperature discontinuity and inversion  in evaporation and condensation</h3>

Although ubiquitous in nature and industrial processes, transport processes
at the interface during evaporation and condensation are still poorly
understood. Experiments have shown temperature discontinuities at the interface
during evaporation and condensation but the experimentally reported interface
temperature jump varies by two orders of magnitude. Even the direction of such
temperature jump is still being debated. Using kinetic-theory based expressions
for the interfacial mass flux and heat flux, we solve coupled problem between
the liquid and the vapor phase during evaporation and condensation. Our model
shows that when evaporation or condensation happens, an intrinsic temperature
difference develops across the interface, due to the mismatch of the enthalpy
carried by vapor at the interface and the bulk region. The vapor temperature
near the interface cools below the saturation temperature on the liquid surface
during evaporation and heats up above the latter during condensation. However,
many existing experiments have shown an opposite trend to this prediction. We
explain this difference as arising from the reverse heat conduction in the
vapor phase. Our model results compare favorably with experiments on both
evaporation and condensation. We show that when the liquid layer is very thin,
most of the applied temperature difference between the solid wall and the vapor
phase happens at the liquid-vapor interface, leading to saturation of the
evaporation and the condensation rates and the corresponding heat transfer
rate. This result contradicts current belief that the evaporation and
condensation rates are inversely proportional to the liquid film thickness.

We employ N-$V$ magnetometry to measure the stray field dynamics of a

observe the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signatures of both
spontaneous DC-driven magnetic oscillations and phase-locking to a second
harmonic drive, developing a simple macrospin model that captures the salient
features. We also observe signatures of dynamics beyond the macrospin model,
including an additional ODMR feature (associated with a second SW mode) and one
mode sapping power from another. Our results provide additional insight into
N-$V$-spin wave coupling mechanisms, and represent a new modality for
sub-wavelength N-$V$ scanned probe microscopy of nanoscale magnetic

interactions, that displays a complex relationship between geometric
frustration and magnetic order in this quasicrystalline system. To navigate the
parameter space and identify distinct magnetic phases, we employ a machine
learning approach, which proves to be a powerful tool in revealing the complex
magnetic behavior of this system. We offer a thorough description of the
magnetic phase diagram as a function of the model parameters. Notably, we
discover among other collinear and non-collinear phases, a unique ferromagnetic
alternating helical phase. In this non-collinear quasiperiodic ferromagnetic
configuration the magnetization decreases logarithmically with the stack

half-filled Haldane model with extended Hubbard interactions and Anderson
disorder shows that disorder favors topology in the interacting case and
extends the topological phase to a larger region of the Hubbard parameters. In
the absence of a staggered potential, we find a novel disorder-driven
topological phase with Chern number C=1, with co-existence of topology with
long range spin and charge orders. More conventional topological Anderson
insulating phases are also found in the presence of a finite staggered
potential.

The NV$^-$ color center in diamond has been extensively investigated for

charge-state decay from the NV$^-$ to its neutral counterpart the NV$^0$
detrimentally affects the robustness of the NV$^-$ center and remains to be
fully overcome. In this work, we provide an $ab~initio$ formalism for
accurately estimating the rate of charge-state decay of color centers in
wide-bandgap semiconductors. Our formalism employs density functional theory
calculations in the context of thermal equilibrium. We illustrate the method
using the transition of NV$^-$ to NV$^0$ in the presence of substitutional N

Population Annealing, the currently state-of-the-art algorithm for solving
spin-glass systems, sometimes finds hard disorder instances for which its
equilibration quality at each temperature step is severely damaged. In such
cases one can therefore not be sure about having reached the true ground state
without vastly increasing the computational resources. In this work we overcome
this problem by proposing a quantum-inspired modification of Population
Annealing. Here we focus on three-dimensional random plaquette gauge model
which ground state energy problem seems to be much harder to solve than
standard spin-glass Edwards-Anderson model. In analogy to the Toric Code, by
allowing single bond flips we let the system explore non-physical states,
effectively expanding the configurational space by the introduction of
topological defects that are then annealed through an additional field
parameter. The dynamics of these defects allow for the effective realization of
non-local cluster moves, potentially easing the equilibration process. We study
the performance of this new method in three-dimensional random plaquette gauge
model lattices of various sizes and compare it against Population Annealing.
With that we conclude that the newly introduced non-local moves are able to
improve the equilibration of the lattices, in some cases being superior to a
normal Population Annealing algorithm with a sixteen times higher computational
resource investment.

We study connections between optimal transport and anomalous thermal
relaxations. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxations is the Mpemba
effect, which occurs when a hot system overtakes an identical warm system and
cools down faster. Conversely, optimal transport is a resource-efficient way to
transport the source distribution to a target distribution in a finite time. By
"a resource-efficient way," what is often meant is with the least amount of
entropy production. Our paradigm for a continuum system is a particle diffusing
on a potential landscape, while for a discrete system, we use a three-state
Markov jump process. In the continuous case, the Mpemba effect is generically
associated with high entropy production. As such, at large yet finite times,
the system evolution toward the target is not optimal in this respect. However,
in the discrete case, we show that for specific dynamics, the optimal transport
and the strong variant of the Mpemba effect can occur for the same relaxation
protocol.

<br>
Nano-scale eutectics, such as rapid solidified Al-Si, exhibit enhanced yield
strength and strain hardening but plasticity is limited by cracking of the hard
phase (Si). Mechanisms that may suppress cracking and enable plastic
co-deformation of soft and hard phases are key to maximizing plasticity in
these high-strength microstructures. Using a combination of laser rapid
solidification and chemical (Sr) modification, we have synthesized fully
eutectic Al-Si microstructures with heavily twinned Si nano-fibers that exhibit
high hardness up to 2.9 GPa, and high compressive flow strength (~840 MPa) with
stable plastic flow to ~26% plastic strain. After deformation, the hard Si(Sr)
fibers did not exhibit cracks, but a high density of stacking faults were
observed in the Si(Sr) fibers suggesting partial dislocation mediated
plasticity. Mechanisms for suppression of cracking and activation of partial
dislocations in Si deformed at room temperature are discussed in terms of
nanoscale fiber geometry with reduced aspect ratio and lowering of the Peierls
barrier in chemically-modified, nano-twinned Si fibers.

A high-fidelity neural network-based force field, NN-F$^{3}$, is developed to
cover the strain states up to material failure and the non-equilibrium,
intermediate nature of fracture. Simulations of fracture in 2D crystals using
NN-F$^{3}$ reveal spatial complexities from lattice-scale kinks to sample-scale
patterns. We find that the fracture resistance cannot be quantified by the
energy densities of relaxed edges as in the literature. Instead, the fracture
patterns, critical stress intensity factors at the kinks, and energy densities
of edges in the intermediate, unrelaxed states offer reasonable measures for
the fracture toughness and its anisotropy.

arbitrary reference fluid system. Through this derivation, we obtain
self-consistent field equations for the electrostatic potential and the Green's
function, serving as the Euler-Lagrange equations for this functional.
Extending our previous mean field formalism~[Y. A. Budkov and A. L. Kolesnikov,
JStatMech, 2022], we account for the electrostatic correlations of the ions. To
achieve this, we employ a general covariant approach [P.E. Brandyshev, Yu.A.
Budkov, J. Chem. Phys., 2023] and derive a total stress tensor that considers
the electrostatic correlations of ions. This is accomplished through an
additional term that depends on the autocorrelation function of the local
electric field fluctuations. Utilizing the derived total stress tensor and
applying the mechanical equilibrium condition, we establish a general
expression for the disjoining pressure of the Coulomb fluids, confined in a
pore with a slit-like geometry.

Polymersomes, vesicles self-assembled from amphiphilic polymers, are
promising nanocarriers for the targeted intracellular delivery of therapeutics.
Integrating inorganic light-absorbing materials with plasmonic properties, such
as gold, into their membrane by in situ synthesis is a stepping stone to enable
their use for photothermal therapy. Yet, it still needs to be determined
whether the in situ synthesis of gold can produce polymersomes with
thermoplasmonic properties without altering their morphology, stability, and
nanocarrier functionality. Here we demonstrate that small gold nanoparticles
can be controllably nucleated within biocompatible block-copolymer membranes to
design hybrid polymersomes with a noteworthy thermoplasmonic response. The
cumulative absorption of individual 2 nm gold nanoparticles can induce
temperature increases in 10 K in dilute suspensions of hybrid polymersomes upon
laser illumination. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical model to rationalize
our observations and predict the thermoplasmonic response of our hybrid
polymersomes. We finally demonstrate in vitro photothermal therapy of cancer
cells, enhanced by the receptor-mediated endocytosis of our hybrid
polymersomes. We envision that our nanotechnological platform can be translated
to phenotypic cell targeting to precisely deliver effective photothermal
agents.

<h3>Semiclassical descriptions of dissipative dynamics of strongly  interacting Bose gases in optical lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16170</a>
<br>
<i>Kazuma Nagao, Ippei Danshita, Seiji Yunoki</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop semiclassical methods for describing real-time dynamics of
dissipative Bose-Hubbard systems in a strongly interacting regime, which can be
realized in experiments with ultracold gases. Specifically, we present two
kinds of SU(3) truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for solving an effective
Lindblad master equation of the systems. The first one employs the discrete TWA
for finite levels or spin systems and is based on a classical equation of
motion in which the onsite dissipation term, as well as the onsite interaction
term, is linearized in the phase space variables. The other approach utilizes a
stochastic Langevin equation, including decoherence effects in terms of
nonlinear drift force and stochastic force terms, in which the initial
conditions of trajectories are weighted with a quasiprobability distribution
for a typical initial quantum state. We apply these methods to the systems with
two-body losses and compare their results with the exact numerical solutions
for a small system. We show that the former approach can simulate correctly
longer-time dynamics than the latter one. We also calculate the time evolution
for a large size setup that is comparable to experiments. We numerically
demonstrate that the discrete TWA approach is able to qualitatively capture the
continuous quantum Zeno effect on dynamics subjected to a gradual change of the
ratio between the hopping amplitude and the onsite interaction across the
superfluid-Mott insulator crossover, which has been observed experimentally.

<br>
<br>
The Casimir-Lifshitz interaction, a long-range force that arises between
solids and molecules due to quantum fluctuations in electromagnetic fields, has
been widely studied in solid-state physics. The degree of polarization in this
interaction is influenced by the dielectric properties of the materials
involved, which in turn are determined by factors such as band-to-band
transitions, free carrier contributions, phonon contributions, and exciton
contributions. Gapped metals, a new class of materials with unique electronic
structures, offer the potential to manipulate dielectric properties and,
consequently, the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. In this study, we theoretically
investigate the finite temperature Casimir-Lifshitz interaction in
La$_3$Te$_4$-based gapped metal systems with varying off-stoichiometry levels.
We demonstrate that off-stoichiometric effects in gapped metals can be used to
control the magnitude and, in some cases, even the sign of Casimir-Lifshitz
interactions. We predict measurable corrections due to stoichiometry on the
predicted Casimir force between a La$_3$Te$_4$ surface and a gold sphere,
attached to an atomic force microscopy tip.

The coexistence of multiple structural phases and field induced short-range
to long-range order transition in ferroelectric materials, leads to a strong
electrocaloric effect (ECE) and electrical energy storage density (Wrec) in the
vicinity of ferroelectric to non-ergodic phase transition in NKBT ceramic.
Structural analysis using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and TEM studies
ascertained the coexistence of tetragonal (P4mm) and rhombohedral (R3c) phases.
Dielectric study has revealed a critical slowing down of polar domain dynamics
below a diffuse phase transition. Present investigation reports ECE in
lead-free (Na0.8K0.2)0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NKBT) ceramic by direct and indirect
methods, which confirm the multifunctional nature of NKBT and its usefulness
for applications in refrigeration and energy storage. A direct method of EC
measurement in NKBT ceramic exhibits significant adiabatic temperature change
({\Delta}T) ~ 1.10 K and electrocaloric strength ({\xi}) ~ 0.55 Kmm/kV near the
ferroelectric to non-ergodic phase transition at an external applied field of
20 kV/cm. A highest recoverable energy (Wrec) ~ 0.78 J/cm3 and electrical
storage efficiency ({\eta}) ~ 86% are achieved at 423 K and an applied field of
20 kV/cm. This behavior is ascribed to the delicate balance between the field
induced order-disordered transition and the thermal energy needed to disrupt
field induced co-operative interaction.

<h3>Spin dynamics in ordered phases of anisotropic triangular-lattice  antiferromagnet Cs2CoBr4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16251</a>
<br>
<i>T. A. Soldatov, A. I. Smirnov, A. V. Syromyatnikov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study spin dynamics of ordered phases of Cs2CoBr4 in a magnetic field
using electron spin resonance (ESR) technique and theoretical analysis. This
material hosts weakly interacting distorted-triangular-lattice planes of
spin-3/2 Co(2+) ions which can be viewed as spin chains coupled by frustrating
interactions. Strong single-ion anisotropy allows to describe the low-energy
spin dynamics of this system by an effective strongly anisotropic
pseudospin-1/2 model. Our ESR data show up to seven branches of magnetic
resonance in four magnetic phases arising due to subtle interplay of
frustration, low dimensionality and strong anisotropy. In particular, in the
low-field collinear stripe phase, the field evolution of modes lying below 200
GHz is described reasonably good by spectra of spin-1 and spin-0 quasiparticles
which we obtain using the bond-operator technique. These well-defined
excitations can be treated as conventional magnons and bound states of two
magnons, respectively. In contrast, numerous excitations lying above 200 GHz
are not captured by our theory due to pronounced one-dimensional correlations
inside spin chains which govern the spin dynamics at high enough energies. As
it was shown before, these modes can be most naturally interpreted as bound
states of domain walls in individual chains and their sequence resembles the
so-called "Zeeman ladder" in anisotropic Ising-like spin chains. Thus, Cs2CoBr4
is a system showing spin-dynamics in ordered state characteristic of both
two-dimensional and one-dimensional magnets.

Topology is now securely established as a means to explore and classify
electronic states in crystalline solids. This review provides a gentle but firm
introduction to topological electronic band structure suitable for new
researchers in the field. I begin by outlining the relevant concepts from
topology, then give a summary of the theory of non-interacting electrons in
periodic potentials. Next, I explain the concepts of the Berry phase and Berry
curvature, and derive key formulae. The remainder of the article deals with how
these ideas are applied to classify crystalline solids according to the
topology of the electronic states, and the implications for observable
properties. Among the topics covered are the role of symmetry in determining
band degeneracies in momentum space, the Chern number and Z2 topological
invariants, surface electronic states, two- and three-dimensional topological
insulators, and Weyl and Dirac semimetals

<br>
<br>
The van der Waals layered magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ offers tantalizing
prospects for the realization of Majorana quasiparticles. Efforts to understand
this are, however, hampered by inconsistent magnetic and thermal transport
properties likely coming from the formation of structural disorder during
crystal growth, postgrowth processing, or upon cooling through the first order
structural transition. Here, we investigate structural disorder in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ using x-ray diffuse scattering and three-dimensional
difference pair distribution function (3D-$\Delta$PDF) analysis. We develop a
quantitative model that describes disorder in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in terms of
rotational twinning and intermixing of the high and low-temperature structural
layer stacking, with no evidence of distortions in individual $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
layers. This disorder may be important to consider when investigating the
detailed magnetic and electronic properties of this widely studied material.

<br>
<br>
Trench defects in multi-quantum wells (MQWs) have been considered as flawed
structures that severely degrade the internal quantum efficiency of
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the past. In this research, trench defects are
innovatively modulated into the structure to enhance the efficiency of red
InGaN LEDs. Specifically, dual-color MQWs structures are grown with green MQWs
at the bottom and red MQWs at the top. When high-density trench defects are
introduced into the green MQWs, the upper red MQWs exhibit a significant
wavelength redshift of 68 nm and approximately 6-fold luminescence enhancement
compared to those without trench defects. The wavelength redshift is attributed
to the increased indium incorporation due to the strain relaxation effect of
trench defects. Moreover, the luminescence enhancement originates from the
strong emission of the red MQWs inside trench defects. The mechanisms behind
the superior luminescent properties of red MQWs within trench defects are
explored in detail. Red InGaN LEDs with an internal quantum efficiency of 16.4%
are achieved by modulating the trench defects. The method of achieving
InGaN-based red emission by introducing trench defects is simple and
reproducible, requiring no additional substrate designs. This research provides
a novel pathway toward achieving high-efficiency red InGaN LEDs.

<h3>Finite-Temperature Quantum Matter with Rydberg or Molecule Synthetic  Dimensions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Synthetic dimension platforms offer unique pathways for engineering quantum
matter. We compute the phase diagram of a many-body system of ultracold atoms
(or polar molecules) with a set of Rydberg states (or rotational states) as a
synthetic dimension, where the particles are arranged in real space in optical
microtrap arrays and interact via dipole-dipole exchange interaction. Using
mean-field theory, we find three ordered phases - two are localized in the
synthetic dimension, predicted as zero-temperature ground states in Refs. [Sci.
Rep., 8, 1 (2018) and Phys. Rev. A 99, 013624 (2019)], and a delocalized phase.
We characterize them by identifying the spontaneously broken discrete
symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We also compute the phase diagram as a function
of temperature and interaction strength, for both signs of the interaction. For
system sizes with more than six synthetic sites and attractive interactions, we
find that the thermal phase transitions can be first or second order, which
leads to a tri-critical point on the phase boundary. By examining the
dependence of the tri-critical point and other special points of the phase
boundary on the synthetic dimension size, we shed light on the physics for
thermodynamically large synthetic dimension.

<h3>Stochasticity in returns can expedite classical first passage under  resetting</h3>

<br>
<i>Arup Biswas, Anupam Kundu, Arnab Pal</i>
<br>
<br>
Classical first passage under resetting is a paradigm in the search process.
Despite its multitude applications across interdisciplinary sciences,
experimental realizations of such resetting processes posit practical
challenges in calibrating these zero time irreversible transitions. We consider
a strategy in which resetting is performed using a finite time return control
protocol in lieu of instantaneous returns. These controls could also be
accompanied with random fluctuations or errors allowing target detection even
during the return phase. To better understand the phenomena, we develop a
unified renewal approach that can encapsulate arbitrary search processes in a
fairly general topography containing targets, various resetting times and
return mechanisms in arbitrary dimensions. While such time-costly protocols
would apparently seem to impede the overall search efficiency, we show that by
leveraging the stochasticity in returns one can expedite the completion gained
even under instantaneous resetting. The formalism is then explored to reveal a
universal criterion distilling the benefits of this strategy. We demonstrate
how this general principle can be utilized to improve overall performance of a
one-dimensional diffusive search process. We believe that such strategies
designed with inherent randomness can be made optimal with precise
controllability in complex search processes.

<i>Arghya Das, Mustansir Barma</i>
<br>
<br>
The Takayasu model is a paradigmatic model of aggregation with mass
injection, known to exhibit a power law distribution of mass over a range which
grows in time. We find that in addition, the mass profile shows distinctive
{\it dynamic condensates} which collectively hold a substantial portion of the
mass (approximately $80\%$ when injection and diffusion rates are equal) and
lead to a substantial hump in the scaled distribution. To track these, we
monitor the largest mass within a growing coarsening length. An interesting
outcome of extremal statistics is that the mean of the globally largest mass in
a finite system grows as a power law in time, modulated by strong
multiplicative logarithms in both time and system size.

<h3>Ab-initio predictions of spin relaxation, dephasing and diffusion in  solids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin relaxation, dephasing and diffusion are at the heart of spin-based
information technology. Accurate theoretical approaches to simulate spin
lifetimes ($\tau_s$), determining how fast the spin polarization and phase
information will be lost, are important to the understandings of underlying
mechanism of these spin processes, and invaluable to search for promising
candidates of spintronic materials. Recently, we develop a first-principles
real-time density-matrix (FPDM) approach to simulate spin dynamics for general
solid-state systems. Through the complete first-principles' descriptions of
light-matter interaction and scattering processes including electron-phonon,
electronimpurity and electron-electron scatterings with self-consistent
spin-orbit coupling, as well as ab initio Land'e g-factor, our method can
predict $\tau_s$ at various conditions as a function of carrier density and
temperature, under electric and magnetic fields. By employing this method, we
successfully reproduce experimental results of disparate materials and identify
the key factors affecting spin relaxation, dephasing, and diffusion in
different materials. Specifically, we predict that germanene has long $\tau_s$
(~100 ns at 50 K), a giant spin lifetime anisotropy and spin-valley locking
effect under electric fields, making it advantageous for spin-valleytronic
applications. Based on our theoretical derivations and ab initio simulations,
we propose a new useful electronic quantity, named spin-flip angle
$\theta^{\uparrow\downarrow}$, for the understanding of spin relaxation through
intervalley spin-flip scattering processes. Our method can be further applied
to other emerging materials and extended to simulate exciton spin dynamics and
steady-state photocurrents due to photogalvanic effect.

<h3>Superconductivity in amorphous and crystalline Re-Lu films</h3>

We report on magnetron deposition and superconducting properties of a novel
superconducting material: rhenium-lutetium films on sapphire substrates.
Different compositions of Re$_{x}$Lu binary are explored from $x\approx 3.8$ to
close to pure Re stoichiometry. The highest critical temperature, up to
$T_{c}\approx $ 6.95 K, is obtained for $x\approx 10.5$. Depending on the
deposition conditions, polycrystalline or amorphous films are obtainable, both
of which are interesting for practice. Crystalline structure of polycrystalline
phase is identified using grazing incidence X-ray diffractometry as a
non-centrosymmetric superconductor. Superconducting properties were
characterized both resistively and magnetically. Demonstration of
superconductivity in this material justifies the point of view that Lu plays a
role of group 3 transition metal in period 6 of the Periodic table of elements.
In analogy with Re$_{0.82}$Nb$_{0.18}$, Re$_{6}$Ti, Re$_{6}$Hf and Re$_{6}$Zr,
one can expect that crystalline Re--Lu is also breaking the time-reversal
symmetry (this still waits confirmation). Magnetoresistivity and AC/DC
susceptibility measurements allowed us to determine H$_{c1}$ and H$_{c2}$ of
these films, as well as estimate coherence length $\xi (0)$ and magnetic
penetration depth $\lambda _{L}(0)$. We also provide information on surface
morphology of these films.

<br>
<br>
One of the most famous proximity effects at ferromagnet/superconductor (F/S)
interfaces is partial conversion of singlet superconductivity to triplet
pairing correlations. Due to the presence of macroscopic exchange field in the
ferromagnet the Cooper pairs penetrating into the ferromagnet from the
superconductor acquire a finite momentum there. The finite-momentum pairing
manifests itself, in particular, as a nonmonotonic dependence of the critical
temperature of the bilayer on the thickness of the F layer. Here we predict
that despite the absence of the macroscopic exchange field the critical
temperature of the antiferromagnet/superconductor (AF/S) bilayers also exhibit
nonmonotonic (oscillating) dependence on the AF layer thickness. It is a
manifestation of the proximity-induced Neel-type triplet correlations, which
acquire finite total pair momentum and oscillate in the AF layer due to the
Umklapp electron scattering processes at the AF/S interface. Our prediction can
provide a possible explanation for a number of recently published experimental
observations of the critical temperature of AF/S bilayers.

We demonstrate optical reflectivity and Raman responses of graphite

applied perpendicular to the material's stacking direction (c-axis). For this,
we employed novel graphite nanoribbons with edges polished through ion-beam
etching. In this unique configuration, a strong polarization dependence of the
D, G, and 2D Raman modes is observed. At the same time, polarized reflectivity
measurements demonstrate the potential of such a device as a carbon-based,

In recent decades, computer experiments have led to an accurate and
fundamental understanding of atomic and molecular mechanisms in fluids, such as
different kinds of relaxation processes toward steady physical states. In this
paper, we investigate how exactly the configuration of initial states in a
molecular-dynamics simulation can affect the rates of decay toward equilibrium
for the widely-known Langevin canonical ensemble. For this purpose, we derive
an original expression relating the system relaxation time {\tau}_{sys} and the
radial distribution function g(r) in the near-zero and high-density limit. We
found that for an initial state which is slightly marginally inhomogeneous in
the number density of atoms, the system relaxation time {\tau}_{sys} is much
longer than that for the homogeneous case and an increasing function of the
Langevin coupling constant, {\gamma}. We also found during structural
equilibration, g(r) at large distances approaches 1 from above for the
inhomogeneous case and from below for the macroscopically homogeneous one.

We report simulation studies of 33 single intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) using three similar coarse-grained (CG) bead-spring models where
interactions among different amino acids (AAs), represented as CG beads, are
introduced through a hydropathy matrix and screened Coulomb interaction to
account for charges of the amino acids along the chain backbone. A comparison
of our simulation studies of two CG models [Dignon et al., PLOS Comp. Biology,
14, 2018, Tesei et al., PNAS, 118, 2021] with two different hydropathy scales
(HPS, M3) for a larger set of AAs with the existing experimental data indicates
an optimal interaction parameter $\epsilon \simeq 0.18 - 0.2$ kCal/mole, as
reported previously, however, with a larger variation. We use these best-fit
parameters to investigate both the universal aspects as well as the fine
structures of the individual IDPs whose characteristics vary substantially in
the charge-hydropathy space by introducing additional metrics. First, we
investigate the polymer specific scaling relations of the IDPs in comparison to
the universal scaling relations [Bair et al., J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 158}, 204902
(2023)] for the homopolymers and demonstrate that the scaled end-to-end
distance $\langle R_N^2\rangle/(2 L\ell_p)$ and the scaled transverse
fluctuation $\sqrt{\langle{l_{\perp}^2}\rangle}/{L}$ are Gaussian. Then we
introduce Wilson charge index ($\mathcal{W}$) that captures the essential
features of charge interactions and distribution in the sequence space, and a
skewness parameter ($\mathcal{S}$) that captures the finer shape variation of
the gyration radii distribution related to the charge asymmetry. Finally, our
study of the variation of <$R_g$> $ as a function of salt concentration
provides another important metric to bring out finer characteristics of the
IDPs which may carry relevant information for the origin of life.

Superconductivity is realized by opening a gap in the superconducting state.
The gap symmetry is crucial in understanding the underlying superconductivity
mechanism. The magnitude and the phase are essential in fully characterizing
the superconducting gap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has
played a key role in determining the gap symmetry in unconventional
superconductors. However, it has been considered so far that ARPES can only
measure the magnitude of the superconducting gap but not its phase; the phase
has to be detected by other phase-sensitive techniques. Here we propose a new
method to directly detect the superconducting gap sign by using ARPES. This
method is successfully validated in a cuprate superconductor with a well-known
$d$-wave gap symmetry. When two bands are nearby in momentum space and have a
strong interband interaction, the resulted electronic structures in the
superconducting state are sensitive to the relative gap sign between the two
bands which can be captured by ARPES measurements. Our present work provides a
new way to detect the gap sign and can be applied to various superconductors,
particularly those with multiple orbitals like the iron-based superconductors.
It also makes ARPES more powerful to determine both the gap magnitude and the
phase that are significant in understanding the superconductivity mechanism of
unconventional superconductors.

The quest for room-temperature superconductors has been teasing scientists
and physicists, since its inception in 1911 itself. Several assertions have
already been made about room temperature superconductivity but were never
verified or reproduced across the labs. The cuprates were the earliest high
transition temperature superconductors, and it seems that copper has done the
magic once again. Last week, a Korean group synthesized a Lead Apatite-based
compound LK-99, showing a T$_c$ of above 400$^\circ$K. The signatures of
superconductivity in the compound are very promising, in terms of resistivity
(R = 0) and diamagnetism at T$_c$. Although, the heat capacity (C$_p$) did not
show the obvious transition at T$_c$. Inspired by the interesting claims of
above room temperature superconductivity in LK-99, in this article, we report
the synthesis of polycrystalline samples of LK-99, by following the same heat
treatment as reported in [1,2] by the two-step precursor method. The phase is
confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, performed after each
heat treatment. The room temperature diamagnetism is not evidenced by the
levitation of a permanent magnet over the sample or vice versa. Further
measurements for the confirmation of bulk superconductivity on variously
synthesized samples are underway. Our results on the present LK-99 sample,
being synthesized at 925$^\circ$C, as of now do not approve the appearance of
bulk superconductivity at room temperature. Further studies with different heat
treatments are though, yet underway.

Carbon nanoribbon or nanographene qubit arrays can facilitate
quantum-to-quantum transduction between light, charge, and spin, making them an
excellent testbed for fundamental science in quantum coherent systems and for
the construction of higher-level qubit circuits. In this work, we study spin
decoherence due to coupling with a surrounding nuclear spin bath of an
electronic molecular spin of a vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) molecule
integrated on an armchair-edged graphene nanoribbon (GNR). Density functional
theory (DFT) is used to obtain ground state atomic configurations. Decay of
spin coherence in Hahn echo experiments is then simulated using the cluster
correlation expansion method with a spin Hamiltonian involving hyperfine and
electric field gradient tensors calculated from DFT. We find that the
decoherence time $T_2$ is anisotropic with respect to magnetic field
orientation and determined only by the hydrogen nuclear spins both on VOPc and
GNR. Large electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) due to nitrogen and
vanadium nuclear spins is present at specific field ranges and can be
completely suppressed by tuning the magnetic field. The relation between these
field ranges and the hyperfine interactions is analyzed. The effects of
interactions with the nuclear quadrupole moments are also studied, validating
the applicability and limitations of the spin Hamiltonian when they are
disregarded.

Ongoing research explores thermal switching materials to control heat flow.
Specifically, there has been interest in magneto-thermal switching (MTS)
materials based on superconductors, which only exhibited switching behavior
when a magnetic field was applied. However, a recent report highlighted
nonvolatile MTS in commercial Sn-Pb solders, attributed to magnetic flux
trapping. In this study, we focused on flux trapping in a type-II
superconductor MgB2. Magnetization and thermal conductivity measurements under
magnetic fields were conducted on polycrystalline MgB2. We confirmed that
magnetic flux was indeed trapped in MgB2 even after demagnetization.
Additionally, we observed nonvolatile MTS in MgB2 as well as Sn-Pb solders.
These results suggest that the nonvolatile MTS may be a widespread
characteristic of superconducting materials with flux trapping.

<h3>Magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday effects in bilayer antiferromagnetic  insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
Control and detection of antiferromagnetic topological materials are
challenging since the total magnetization vanishes. Here we investigate the
magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday effects in bilayer antiferromagnetic insulator
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. We find that by breaking the combined mirror symmetries with
either perpendicular electric field or external magnetic moment, Kerr and
Faraday effects occur. Under perpendicular electric field, antiferromagnetic
topological insulators (AFMTI) show sharp peaks at the interband transition
threshold, whereas trivial insulators show small adjacent positive and negative
peaks. Gate voltage and Fermi energy can be tuned to reveal the differences
between AFMTI and trivial insulators. We find that AFMTI with large
antiferromagnetic order can be proposed as a pure magneto-optical rotator due
to sizable Kerr (Faraday) angles and vanishing ellipticity. Under external
magnetic moment, AFMTI and trivial insulators are significantly different in
the magnitude of Kerr and Faraday angles and ellipticity. For the qualitative
behaviors, AFMTI shows distinct features of Kerr and Faraday angles when the
spin configurations of the system change. These phenomena provide new
possibilities to optically detect and manipulate the layered topological
antiferromagnets.

<h3>Coexistence of Superconductivity and ferromagnetism in high entropy  carbide ceramics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Generally, the superconductivity was expected to be absent in magnetic
systems, but this reception was disturbed by unconventional superconductors,
such as cuprates, iron-based superconductors and recently discovered nickelate,
since their superconductivity is proposed to be related to the
electron-electron interaction mediated by the spin fluctuation. However, the
coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is still rare in conventional
superconductors. In this work, we reported the coexistence of these two quantum
orderings in high entropy carbide ceramics (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2V0.2W0.2)C0.9,
(Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C, and they are expected to be conventional
superconductors. Clear magnetic hysteresis loop was observed in these high
entropy carbides, indicating a ferromagnetic ground state. A sharp
superconducting transition is observed in (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2V0.2W0.2)C0.9 with a
Tc of 3.4 K and upper critical field of ~3.35 T. Meanwhile, superconductivity
is suppressed to some extent and zero-resistance state disappears in
(Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C, in which stronger magnetism is presented. The
upper critical field of (Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C is only ~1.5 T, though they
show higher transition temperature near 5.7 K. The ferromagnetism stems from
the carbon vacancies which occurs often during the high temperature synthesis
process. This work not just demonstrate the observation of superconductivity in
high entropy carbide ceramics, but also provide alternative exotic platform to
study the correlation between superconductivity and magnetism, and is of great
benefit for the design of multifunctional electronic devices.

<h3>Ballistic spin-transport properties of magnetic tunnel junctions with  MnCr-based ferrimagnetic quaternary Heusler alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the suitability of nearly half-metallic ferrimagnetic
quaternary Heusler alloys, CoCrMnZ (Z=Al, Ga, Si, Ge) to assess the feasibility
as electrode materials of MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ). Low
magnetic moments of these alloys originated from the anti-ferromagnetic
coupling between Mn and Cr spins ensure a negligible stray field in spintronics
devices as well as a lower switching current required to flip their spin
direction. We confirmed mechanical stability of these materials from the
evaluated values of elastic constants, and the absence of any imaginary
frequency in their phonon dispersion curves. The influence of swapping
disorders on the electronic structures and their relative stability are also
discussed. A high spin polarization of the conduction electrons are observed in
case of CoCrMnZ/MgO hetrojunctions, independent of terminations at the
interface. Based on our ballistic transport calculations, a large coherent
tunnelling of the majority-spin $s$-like $\Delta_1$ states can be expected
through MgO-barrier. The calculated tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios
are in the order of 1000\%. A very high Curie temperatures specifically for
CoCrMnAl and CoCrMnGa, which are comparable to $bcc$ Co, could also yield a
weaker temperature dependece of TMR ratios for CoCrMnAl/MgO/CoCrMnAl (001) and
CoCrMnGa/MgO/CoCrMnGa (001) MTJ.

<h3>Extremal statistics for a one-dimensional Brownian motion with a  reflective boundary</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16443" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16443</a>
<br>
<i>Feng Huang, Hanshuang Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the extreme value statistics of a one-dimensional Brownian
motion (with the diffusion constant $D$) during a time interval $\left[0, t
\right]$ in the presence of a reflective boundary at the origin, starting from
a positive position $x_0$. By deriving the survival probability of the Brownian
particle without hitting an absorbing boundary at $x=M$, we obtain the
distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ and its expectation
$\langle M \rangle$. In the short-time limit, i.e., $t \ll t_d$ where
$t_d=x_0^2/D$ is the diffusion time from the starting position $x_0$ to the
reflective boundary at the origin, the particle behaves like a free Brownian
motion without any boundaries. In the long-time limit, $t \gg t_d$, $\langle M
\rangle$ grows with $t$ as $\langle M \rangle \sim \sqrt{t}$, which is similar
to the free Brownian motion, but the prefactor is $\pi/2$ times of the free
Brownian motion, embodying the effect of the reflective boundary. By solving
the propagator and using a path decomposition technique, we obtain the joint
distribution $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ of $M$ and the time $t_m$ at which this maximum
is achieved, from which the marginal distribution $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ is also
obtained. For $t \ll t_d$, $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ looks like a U-shaped attributed to
the arcsine law of free Brownian motion. For $t$ equal to or larger than order
of magnitude of $t_m$, $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ deviates from the U-shaped distribution
and becomes asymmetric with respect to $t/2$. Moreover, we compute the
expectation $\langle t_m \rangle$ of $t_m$, and find that $\langle t_m
\rangle/t$ is an increasing function of $t$. In two limiting cases, $\langle
t_m \rangle/t \to 1/2$ for $t \ll t_d$ and $\langle t_m \rangle/t \to (1+2G)/4
\approx 0.708$ for $t \gg t_d$, where $G\approx0.916$ is the Catalan's
constant. All the theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations.

We present a symmetrization routine that optimizes and eases the analysis of
data featuring the anomalous Hall effect. This technique can be transferred to
any hysteresis with (point-)symmetric behaviour. The implementation of the
method is demonstrated exemplarily using intermixed longitudinal and
transversal data obtained from a chromium-doped ternary topological insulator
revealing a clear hysteresis. Furthermore, by introducing a mathematical
description of the anomalous Hall hysteresis based on the error function
precise values of the height and coercive field are determined.

<h3>Persistent spin dynamics in magnetically ordered honeycomb cobalt oxides</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the quest to find quantum spin liquids, layered cobalt oxides Na2Co2TeO6
and Na3Co2SbO6 have been proposed as promising candidates for approximating the
Kitaev honeycomb model. Yet, their suitability has been thrown into question
due to observed long-range magnetic order at low temperatures and indications
of easy-plane, rather than Kitaev-type, spin anisotropy. Here we use muon spin
relaxation to reveal an unexpected picture: contrary to the anticipated static
nature of the long-range order, the systems show prevalent spin dynamics with
spatially uneven distribution and varied correlation times. This underlines
that the magnetic ground states cannot be solely described by the long-range
order, suggesting a significant role of quantum fluctuations. Our findings not
only shed new light on the complex physics of these systems but also underscore
the need for a refined approach in the search for realizable quantum spin
liquids.

<h3>Gating ferromagnetic resonance by superconductors via modulated  reflection of magnetization-radiated electric fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16472</a>
<br>
<i>Xi-Han Zhou, Tao Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict that ferromagnetic resonance in insulating magnetic film with
inplane magnetization radiates electric fields polarized along the
magnetization with opposite amplitudes at two sides of the magnetic insulator,
which can be modulated strongly by adjacent superconductors. With a single
superconductor adjacent to the magnetic insulator this radiated electric field
is totally reflected with a $\pi$-phase shift, which thereby vanishes at the
superconductor side and causes no influence on the ferromagnetic resonance.
When the magnetic insulator is sandwiched by two superconductors, this
reflection becomes back and forth, so the electric field exists at both
superconductors that drives the Meissner supercurrent, which in turn shifts
efficiently the ferromagnetic resonance. We predict an ultrastrong coupling
between magnons in the yttrium iron garnet and Cooper pairs in NbN with the
frequency shift achieving tens of percent of the bare ferromagnetic resonance.

We report on the crystal structure and ferroelectric properties of epitaxial
ZrO$_2$ films ranging from 7 to 42 nm thickness grown on
La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$-buffered (110)-oriented SrTiO$_3$ substrate. By
employing X-ray diffraction, we confirm a tetragonal phase at all investigated
thicknesses, with slight in-plane strain due to the substrate in the thinnest
films. Further confirmation of the tetragonal phase was obtained through
Infrared absorption spectroscopy with synchrotron light, performed on ZrO$_2$
membrane transferred onto a high resistive Silicon substrate. Up to a thickness
of 31 nm, the ZrO$_2$ epitaxial films exhibit ferroelectric behavior, at
variance with the antiferroelectric behavior reported previously for the
tetragonal phase in polycrystalline films. However, the ferroelectricity is
found here to diminish with increasing film thickness, with a polarization of
about 13 $\mu$C.cm$^{-2}$ and down to 1 $\mu$C.cm$^{-2}$ for 7 nm and 31
nm-thick ZrO$_2$ films, respectively. This highlights the role of thickness
reduction, substrate strain, and surface effects in promoting polarization in
the tetragonal ZrO$_2$ thin films. These findings provide new insights into the
ferroelectric properties and structure of ZrO$_2$ thin films, and open up new
directions to investigate the origin of ferroelectricity in ZrO$_2$ and to
optimize this material for future applications.

<h3>Random walks in correlated diffusivity landscapes</h3>

In recent years, several experiments highlighted a new type of diffusion
anomaly, which was called Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. In systems
displaying this behavior, the mean squared displacement of the diffusing
particles grows linearly in time, like in a normal diffusion, but the
distribution of displacements is non-Gaussian. In situations when the
convergence to Gaussian still takes place at longer times, the probability
density of the displacements may show a persisting peak around the
distribution's mode, and the pathway of convergence to the Gaussian is unusual.
One of the theoretical models showing such a behavior corresponds to a
disordered system with local diffusion coefficients slowly varying in space.
While the standard pathway to Gaussian, as proposed by the Central Limit
Theorem, would assume that the peak, under the corresponding rescaling,
smoothens and lowers in course of the time; in the model discussed, the peak,
under rescaling, narrows and stays sharp. In the present work, we discuss the
nature of this peak. On a coarse-grained level, the motion of the particles in
the diffusivity landscape is described by continuous time random walks with
correlations between waiting times and positions. The peak is due to strong
spatiotemporal correlations along the trajectories of diffusing particles.
Destroying these correlations while keeping the temporal structure of the
process intact leads to the decay of the peak. We also note that the correlated
CTRW model reproducing serial correlations between the waiting times along the
trajectory fails to quantitatively reproduce the shape of the peak even for the
decorrelated motion, while being quite accurate in the wings of the PDF. This
shows the importance of high-order temporal correlations for the peak's
formation.

<h3>Emergence of stable meron quartets in twisted magnets</h3>

The investigation of twist engineering in easy-axis magnetic systems has
revealed the remarkable potential for generating topological spin textures,
such as magnetic skyrmions. Here, by implementing twist engineering in
easy-plane magnets, we introduce a novel approach to achieve fractional
topological spin textures such as merons. Through atomistic spin simulations on
twisted bilayer magnets, we demonstrate the formation of a stable double meron
pair in two magnetic layers, which we refer to as the "Meron Quartet" (MQ).
Unlike merons in a single pair, which is unstable against pair annihilation,
the merons within the MQ exhibit exceptional stability against pair
annihilation due to the protective localization mechanism induced by the twist
that prevents the collision of the meron cores. Furthermore, we showcase that
the stability of the MQ can be enhanced by adjusting the twist angle, resulting
in increased resistance to external perturbations such as external magnetic
fields. Our findings highlight the twisted magnet as a promising platform for
investigating the intriguing properties of merons, enabling their realization
as stable magnetic quasiparticles in van der Waals magnets.

In isolated nonlinear optical waveguide arrays with bounded energy spectrum,
simultaneous conservation of energy and power of the optical modes enables
study of coupled thermal and particle transport in the negative temperature
regime. Here, based on exact numerical simulation and rationale from Landauer
formalism, we predict generic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in such
systems. This is rooted in the spectral decoupling of thermal and power current
of optical modes, and their different temperature dependence. Our work extends
the study of coupled thermal and particle transport into unprecedented regimes,
not reachable in natural condensed matter and atomic gas systems.

Using the density-of-states approach, we analytically obtain the magnetic
susceptibility and heat capacity over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic

Realizing quantum phases of electrons with high critical temperatures (Tc)
has been one of the most important goals in quantum materials research, as
exemplified by the longstanding and sometimes contentious quest for high Tc
superconductors. Recently, 2D moir\'e materials have emerged as the most
versatile platform for the realization of a broad range of quantum phases.
These quantum phases are commonly observed at cryogenic temperatures, but a few
of them exhibit sufficiently high Tc, e.g., ~ 150 K for Mott insulator states
in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e interfaces. Here, we explore
the origins of the stability of correlated states in WSe2/WS2 moir\'e
superlattices by measuring the time scales of melting and their temperature
dependences. Using exciton sensing and pump-probe reflectance spectroscopy, we
find that ultrafast electronic excitation leads to melting of the Mott states
on a time scale of 3.3 ps (at T = 11 K), which is approximately five times
longer than that predicted from the charge hopping integral between moir\'e
unit cells. We further find that the melting rates are thermally activated,
with activation energies of Ea = 18 meV and 13 meV for the correlated states
with one and two holes (v = -1 and -2) per moir\'e unit cell, respectively,
suggesting significant electron-phonon coupling. The overall temperature
dependences in the exciton oscillator strength, a proxy to the order parameter
for the correlated states, gives estimates of Tc in agreement with the
extracted Ea. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the moir\'e scale
confirm polaron formation in the v = -1 Mott state and predict a hole polaron
binding energy of 16 meV, in agreement with experiment. These findings suggest
a close interplay of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the
formation of polaronic Mott insulators at TMD moir\'e interfaces.

<h3>The Decimation Scheme for Symmetric Matrix Factorization</h3>

Matrix factorization is an inference problem that has acquired importance due
to its vast range of applications that go from dictionary learning to
recommendation systems and machine learning with deep networks. The study of
its fundamental statistical limits represents a true challenge, and despite a
decade-long history of efforts in the community, there is still no closed
formula able to describe its optimal performances in the case where the rank of
the matrix scales linearly with its size. In the present paper, we study this
extensive rank problem, extending the alternative 'decimation' procedure that
we recently introduced, and carry out a thorough study of its performance.
Decimation aims at recovering one column/line of the factors at a time, by
mapping the problem into a sequence of neural network models of associative
memory at a tunable temperature. Though being sub-optimal, decimation has the
advantage of being theoretically analyzable. We extend its scope and analysis
to two families of matrices. For a large class of compactly supported priors,
we show that the replica symmetric free entropy of the neural network models
takes a universal form in the low temperature limit. For sparse Ising prior, we
show that the storage capacity of the neural network models diverges as
sparsity in the patterns increases, and we introduce a simple algorithm based
on a ground state search that implements decimation and performs matrix
factorization, with no need of an informative initialization.

Freestanding slender fluid filaments of room temperature ferroelectric
nematic liquid crystals are described. They are stabilized either by internal
electric fields of bound charges formed due to polarization splay, or by
external voltage applied between suspending wires. The phenomenon is similar to
those observed in dielectric fluids, such as deionized water, except that in
ferroelectric nematic materials the voltages required are 3 orders of
magnitudes smaller and the aspect ratio is much higher. The observed
ferroelectric fluid threads are not only unique and novel, but also offer
measurements of basic physical quantities, such as the ferroelectric
polarization and viscosity. Ferroelectric nematic fluid threads may have
practical applications in nano-fluidic micron-size logic devices, switches, and
relays.

<br>
<br>
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) exhibit a broad range of physicochemical
properties that critically depend on their width and edge topology. While the
chemically stable GNRs with armchair edges (AGNRs) are semiconductors with
width-tunable band gap, GNRs with zigzag edges (ZGNRs) host spin-polarized edge
states, which renders them interesting for applications in spintronic and
quantum technologies. However, these states significantly increase their
reactivity. For GNRs fabricated via on-surface synthesis under ultrahigh vacuum
conditions on metal substrates, the expected reactivity of zigzag edges is a
serious concern in view of substrate transfer and device integration under
ambient conditions, but corresponding investigations are scarce. Using
10-bromo-9,9':10',9''-teranthracene as a precursor, we have thus synthesized
hexanthene (HA) and teranthene (TA) as model compounds for ultrashort GNRs with
mixed armchair and zigzag edges, characterized their chemical and electronic
structure by means of scanning probe methods, and studied their chemical
reactivity upon air exposure by Raman spectroscopy. We present a detailed
identification of molecular orbitals and vibrational modes, assign their origin
to armchair or zigzag edges, and discuss the chemical reactivity of these edges
based on characteristic Raman spectral features.

We present an experimental study of bilayers of a disordered Ag metal layer
close to the metal-insulator transition and an Indium Oxide film which is on
the insulating side of the superconductor-insulator-transition. Our results
show that superconducting fluctuations within the indium-oxide film, that
proximitize the underlying metal layer, induce insulating rather than
superconducting behavior. This is ascribed to suppression of density of states
(due to the superconducting energy gap) for quasiparticles in the proximitized
regions. Our results present a novel manifestation of the proximity effect
phenomenon and provide important insight into the nature of the insulating
phase of the disorder driven superconductor-insulator-transition.

Halide perovskite and elpasolite semiconductors are extensively studied for
optoelectronic applications due to their excellent performance together with
significant chemical and structural flexibility. However, there is still
limited understanding of their basic elastic properties and how they vary with
composition and temperature, which is relevant for synthesis and device
operation. To address this, we performed temperature- and pressure-dependent
synchrotron-based powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). In contrast to previous
pressure-dependent XRD studies, our relatively low pressures (ambient to 0.06
GPa) enabled us to investigate the elastic properties of halide perovskites and
elpasolites in their ambient crystal structure. We find that halide perovskites
and elpasolites show common trends in the bulk modulus and thermal expansivity.
Both materials become softer as the halide ionic radius increases from Cl to Br
to I, exhibiting higher compressibility and larger thermal expansivity. The
mixed-halide compositions show intermediate properties to the pure compounds.
Contrary, cations show a minor effect on the elastic properties. Finally, we
observe that thermal phase transitions in e.g., MAPbI3 and CsPbCl3 lead to a
softening of the lattice, together with negative expansivity for certain
crystal axes, already tens of degrees away from the transition temperature.
Hence, the range in which the phase transition affects thermal and elastic
properties is substantially broader than previously thought. These findings
highlight the importance of considering the temperature-dependent elastic
properties of these materials, since stress induced during manufacturing or
temperature sweeps can significantly impact the stability and performance of
the corresponding devices.

The structural and magnetic properties of the as-cast and annealed
V0.6-xSixTi0.4 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) alloy superconductors are reported
here. It is found that addition of silicon to the V-Ti alloys results in
eutectic precipitation of Ti5Si3-phase in the body centred cubic (bcc)
\b{eta}-V-Ti matrix. In the as-cast V0.6-xSixTi0.4 alloys, the superconducting
transition temperature (TC) changes non-monotonically with increasing silicon
content whereas after annealing, it is about 7.7 K for all the alloys. On the
other hand, the upper critical field decreases and the coherence length
increases after annealing in the x = 0.10 alloy. The variations in the
superconducting properties in the alloys are related to the solubility of 6
at.% Si in the V0.60Ti0.40 alloy and the vanadium enrichment in the \b{eta}
matrix due to the precipitation of Ti5Si3 phase.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold great
potential for future low-energy optoelectronics owing to their unique
electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
is the technique widely used for the synthesis of large-area TMDs. However, due
to high sensitivity to the growth environment, reliable synthesis of monolayer
TMDs via CVD remains challenging. Here we develop a controllable CVD process
for large-area synthesis of monolayer WS2 crystals, films, and in-plane
graphene-WS2 heterostructures by cleaning the reaction tube with hydrochloric
acid, sulfuric acid and aqua regia. The concise cleaning process can remove the
residual contaminates attached to the CVD reaction tube and crucibles, reducing
the nucleation density but enhancing the diffusion length of WS2 species. The
photoluminescence (PL) mappings of a WS2 single crystal and film reveal that
the extraordinary PL around the edges of a triangular single crystal is induced
by ambient water intercalation at the WS2-sapphire interface. The extraordinary
PL can be controlled by the choice of substrates with different wettabilities.

Surpassing the individual buildings of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)
and the scale-free localization (SFL) observed lately, we systematically
exploit the exponential decay behavior of bulk eigenstates via the transfer
matrix approach in non-Hermitian systems. We concentrate on the one-dimensional
(1D) finite-size non-Hermitian systems with 2*2 transfer matrices in the
participation of boundary impurity. We analytically unveil that the
unidirectional pure scale-free (UPSF) effect emerges with the singular transfer
matrices, while the hybrid skin-scale-free (HSSF) effect emerges with the
nonsingular transfer matrices even though impose open boundary condition (OBC).
The UPSF effect exceeds the scope of the SFL in previous works, while the HSSF
effect is a charming interplay between the finite-size NHSE and SFL. Our
results reveal that the NHSE under OBC prevails in the blend with the SFL as
the system tends to the thermodynamic limit. Our approach paves an avenue to
rigorously explore the finite-size display of the NHSE and SFL in both
Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems with generic boundary conditions.

In this paper, a phenomenological theory of saturated ferromagnetoelastic
conductors is established using a multi-continuum model and the classical laws
of mechanics, thermodynamics and electromagnetics. The theory is nonlinear and
is valid for large deformations and strong electromagnetic fields. The
constitutive relations in the theory satisfy the saturation condition of the
magnetization vector. The theory is with full electromagnetic couplings as
governed by the equations of electrodynamics. It can describe the interactions
of elastic, electromagnetic and spin waves. The theory can be reduced to
various quasistatic theories with appropriate approximations of the
electromagnetic fields. It is for anisotropic materials in general.

Measuring NT-proBNP biomarker is recommended for preliminary diagnostics of
the heart failure. Recent studies suggest a possibility of early screening of
biomarkers in saliva for non-invasive identification of cardiac diseases at the
point-of-care. However, NT-proBNP concentrations in saliva can be thousand
times lower than in blood plasma, going down to pg/mL level. To reach this
level, we developed a label-free aptasensor based on a liquid-gated field
effect transistor using a film of reduced graphene oxide monolayer (rGO-FET)
with immobilized NT-proBNP specific aptamer. We found that, depending on ionic
strength of tested solutions, there were different levels of correlation in
responses of electrical parameters of the rGO-FET aptasensor, namely, the Dirac
point shift and transconductance change. The correlation in response to
NT-proBNP was high for 1.6 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and zero for 16
mM PBS in a wide range of analyte concentrations, varied from 1 fg/mL to 10
ng/mL. The effect in transconductance and Dirac point shift in PBS solutions of
different concentrations are discussed. The biosensor exhibited a high
sensitivity for both transconductance (2*10E-6 S/decade) and Dirac point shift
(2.3 mV/decade) in diluted PBS with the linear range from 10 fg/ml to 1 pg/ml.
The aptasensor performance has been also demonstrated in undiluted artificial
saliva with the achieved limit of detection down to 41 fg/mL (~4.6 fM).

Bayesian inference and kernel methods are well established in machine
learning. The neural network Gaussian process in particular provides a concept
to investigate neural networks in the limit of infinitely wide hidden layers by
using kernel and inference methods. Here we build upon this limit and provide a
field-theoretic formalism which covers the generalization properties of
infinitely wide networks. We systematically compute generalization properties
of linear, non-linear, and deep non-linear networks for kernel matrices with
heterogeneous entries. In contrast to currently employed spectral methods we
derive the generalization properties from the statistical properties of the
input, elucidating the interplay of input dimensionality, size of the training
data set, and variability of the data. We show that data variability leads to a
non-Gaussian action reminiscent of a ($\varphi^3+\varphi^4$)-theory. Using our
formalism on a synthetic task and on MNIST we obtain a homogeneous kernel
matrix approximation for the learning curve as well as corrections due to data
variability which allow the estimation of the generalization properties and
exact results for the bounds of the learning curves in the case of infinitely
many training data points.

<h3>Electron correlations and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under  pressure tuning</h3>

Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
under pressure, we discuss the basic ingredients of a model that captures the
evolution of pressure tuning. In particular, we study the effects of electron
correlations of a bilayer Hubbard model including the Ni $3d$ $x^2-y^2$ and
$z^2$ orbitals. By performing the calculation in the bonding-antibonding
molecular orbital basis, we show the ground state of the model crosses over
from a low-spin $S=1/2$ state to a high-spin $S=3/2$ state. In the high-spin
state, the two $x^2-y^2$ and the bonding $z^2$ orbitals are all close to
half-filling. It promotes an orbital-selective Mott phase where the $x^2-y^2$
orbitals are Mott localized while the $z^2$ orbitals are renormalized but
remaining itinernant. Strong orbital selectivity is shown to exist in a broad
crossover regime of the phase diagram. Based on these results, we construct an
effective multiorbital $t$-$J$ model to describe the superconductivity of the
system, and find the leading pairing channel to be an intraorbital spin singlet
with a competition between the extended $s$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetries.
Our results highlight the role of strong multiorbital correlation effects in
driving the superconductivity of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

Absence of local conserved quantities is often considered to be a necessary
condition for thermalization. Although many studies have discussed whether
thermalization occurs in the Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse
fields, rigorous results on local conserved quantities of this model have been
still lacking. Here, we rigorously prove that, if all coupling constants are
nonzero, this model has no conserved quantity spanned by local operators with
support size up to the half of the system size other than trivial one, i.e., a
linear combination of the Hamiltonian and the identity. We also discuss
relation to integrability of the model where longitudinal field is set to zero.
Our results provide the second example of spin models whose nonintegrability is
rigorously proved.

Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum
technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their
electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate
their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a
self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a
quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent
photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the
well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime
and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and
amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new
photon-mediated regimes Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the
QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results
provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide
range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of
QD-photon interactions.

We study electron correlations in a multi-well system, focusing on the
density-induced and pair tunneling terms of the non-standard Hubbard model.
These terms are evaluated analytically using a newly developed, ambiguity-free,
perturbative approach to the Wannier functions. We show that the
density-induced tunneling generated by finite-range repulsive electron
interaction can match and eventually suppress the free single-electron
tunneling. However, this suppression does not lead to an insulating state, but
rather to the propagation of a correlated electron pair due to the pair
tunneling term of the non-standard Hubbard model. This pair can be considered
as a bound state in the multi-well system, since it cannot decay due to
single-electron tunneling transitions. We illustrate this by analyzing the
motion of two electrons in a triple-well potential. We expect that such a
pairing mechanism can be realized by finite-range repulsive interaction in many
other systems.

By inducing smart materials and well-designed structures, functional surfaces
have been developed for small-scale liquid/solid manipulation tasks, benefiting
crucial applications in the fields of microfluidics, soft robotics, and
biomedical engineering. However, it remains challenging to design functional
systems with flexible, tunable, and multimodal liquid/solid manipulation
capabilities. Here, inspired by asymmetric structural features in natural
plants and metachrony in cross-scale biological systems, I report a
magnetic-responsive functional surface that can achieve rich liquid operations
in an energy-free manner and transport solids with multiple degrees of freedom
(DOFs). Curvature pillars on the surface and their magnetic-driven
tilt/gradient arrangement endow liquids with multi-directional spreading modes
based on Laplace pressure asymmetry. I reveal the mechanisms of these liquid
spreading modes, and correspondingly develop attractive liquid operations,
e.g., adjustable anti-gravity climbing, the spontaneous modal shift in liquid
transport, and liquid mixing. Moreover, the dynamic metachronal motion of
magnetic pillars can be utilized to transport solid objects. I illustrate the
synchronous/asynchronous transport modes of the surface, and by coordinating
the object arrangement and magnetic actuation strategies, I propose a novel
strategy to achieve 3-DOF solid transportation. This study presents a new
design concept for application-oriented amphibious manipulation surfaces, which
can find meaning in extensive engineering applications.

We investigate the ground state and dynamics of one-dimensional spin-orbit
coupled (SOC) quantum droplets within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach.
Stripe droplet patterns emerge for increasing SOC wavenumber possessing a
flat-top background for larger particle number. The surface energy features a
power-law decay with respect to interactions. At small SOC wavenumbers, a
transition from Gaussian to flat-top droplets occurs for either larger atom
number or reduced intercomponent attraction. The excitation spectrum
demonstrates, for instance, droplet stability and an admixture of phonons and
rotons at large atom numbers and SOC wavenumbers. Unstable parametric regions
are attributed to the interplay of SOC and Lee-Huang-Yang energy contributions.
Rich droplet dynamical features are found using velocity imprinting, and abrupt
changes on the intercomponent interaction or the SOC parameters. Characteristic
type of responses include, breathing oscillations, expansion, symmetric and
asymmetric droplet fragmentation, admixtures of single and stripe droplet
branches as well as erratic spatial distributions suggesting the triggering of
relevant instabilities. Our results unveil the controlled dynamical generation
and stability of stripe droplets that should be detectable in current cold-atom
experiments.

The tradeoff relation between speed and cost is a central issue in designing
fast and efficient information processing devices. We derive an achievable
bound on thermodynamic cost for obtaining information through finite-time
(non-quasi-static) measurements. Our proof is based on optimal transport
theory, which enables us to identify the explicit protocol to achieve the
obtained bound. Moreover, we demonstrate that the optimal protocol can be
approximately implemented by an experimentally feasible setup with quantum
dots. Our results would lead to design principles of high-speed and
low-energy-cost information processing.

<br>
<br>
We study the shepherding problem where a group of "herders" need to drive the
dynamics of a group of "target" agents. In particular, we relax two strong
assumptions made in the existing literature, namely that the targets' own
dynamics shows cohesive collective behaviour (e.g. flocking) in the absence of
herders and that the herders possess global sensing capability. We find, for
the first time, scaling laws linking the number of targets to be herd to the
minimum number of herders that can solve the problem. Surprisingly we observe
that, when limited sensing is present, the number of herders needed to
successfully achieve the herding task significantly increases as the targets'
density becomes lower than a critical threshold. We explain the existence of
such a threshold in terms of the percolation of a suitably defined herdability
graph. Exhaustive numerical experiments validate and confirm the effectiveness
of our methodology.

Nucleation of the pair condensate near surfaces above the upper critical
magnetic field and the pair-condensate enhancement/suppression induced by
changes in the electron-phonon interaction at interfaces are the most known
examples of the surface superconductivity. Recently, another example has been
reported, when the surface enhancement of the critical superconducting
temperature occurs due to quantum interference. In this case the pair states
spread over the entire volume of the system while exhibiting the constructive
interference near the surface. In the present work we investigate how an
applied electric field impacts the interference-induced surface
superconductivity. The study is based on a numerical solution of the
self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a one-dimensional attractive
Hubbard model. Our results demonstrate that the surface superconducting
characteristics, especially the surface critical temperature, are sensitive to
the applied electric field and can be tailored by changing its magnitude.

The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature
superconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational
attention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite
(Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P). To verify this exciting claim, we have
successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of
these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a
highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9
Ohm.cm and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of
~5.22x10^-4 Ohm.cm. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits
semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity
of ~1.94x10^4 Ohm.cm although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray
diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,
when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial
Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic
levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a
room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful
re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.

As first demonstrated by the characterization of the quantum Hall effect by
the Chern number, topology provides a guiding principle to realize robust
properties of condensed matter systems immune to the existence of disorder. The
bulk-boundary correspondence guarantees the emergence of gapless boundary modes
in a topological system whose bulk exhibits nonzero topological invariants.
Although some recent studies have suggested a possible extension of the notion
of topology to nonlinear systems such as photonics and electrical circuits, the
nonlinear counterpart of topological invariant has not yet been understood.
Here, we propose the nonlinear extension of the Chern number based on the
nonlinear eigenvalue problems in two-dimensional systems and reveal the
bulk-boundary correspondence beyond the weakly nonlinear regime. Specifically,
we find the nonlinearity-induced topological phase transitions, where the
existence of topological edge modes depends on the amplitude of oscillatory
modes. We propose and analyze a minimal model of a nonlinear Chern insulator
whose exact bulk solutions are analytically obtained and indicate the amplitude
dependence of the nonlinear Chern number, for which we confirm the nonlinear
counterpart of the bulk-boundary correspondence in the continuum limit. Thus,
our result reveals the existence of genuinely nonlinear topological phases that
are adiabatically disconnected from the linear regime, showing the promise for
expanding the scope of topological classification of matter towards the
nonlinear regime.

The spin-orbit interaction is frequently the mechanism by which spin and
charge are coupled for spintronic applications. The discovery of spin, a
century ago, relied on spin-charge coupling by a magnetic field gradient; this
mechanism has received scant attention as a means for generating spin and
charge currents in semiconductors. Through the derivation of a set of coupled
spin-charge drift-diffusion equations, our work shows that magnetic field
gradients can be used to generate charge currents from non-equilibrium spin
polarization, in solid state systems. We predict, in GaAs, an ``Stern-Gerlach"
voltage comparable to what is measured by the inverse spin Hall effect.
Non-intuitively, we find the spin diffusion length is reduced by the magnetic
gradient. This is understood by invoking the idea of co-current and
counter-current exchange which is a concept frequently invoked in fields as
disparate as animal physiology and thermal engineering.

Polymeric materials are widely used in industries ranging from automotive to
biomedical. Their mechanical properties play a crucial role in their
application and function and arise from the nanoscale structures and
interactions of their constitutive polymer molecules. Polymeric materials
behave viscoelastically, i.e. their mechanical responses depend on the time
scale of the measurements; quantifying these time-dependent rheological
properties at the nanoscale is relevant to develop, for example, accurate
models and simulations of those materials, which are needed for advanced
industrial applications. In this paper, an atomic force microscopy (AFM) method
based on the photothermal actuation of an AFM cantilever is developed to
quantify the nanoscale loss tangent, storage modulus, and loss modulus of
polymeric materials. The method is then validated on a styrene-butadiene rubber
(SBR), demonstrating the method's ability to quantify nanoscale viscoelasticity
over a continuous frequency range up to five orders of magnitude (0.2 Hz to
20,200 Hz). Furthermore, this method is combined with AFM viscoelastic mapping
obtained with amplitude-modulation frequency-modulation (AM-FM) AFM, enabling
the extension of viscoelastic quantification over an even broader frequency
range, and demonstrating that the novel technique synergizes with preexisting
AFM techniques for quantitative measurement of viscoelastic properties. The
method presented here introduces a way to characterize the viscoelasticity of
polymeric materials, and soft matter in general at the nanoscale, for any
application.

La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and find a robust $s$-wave superconductive (SC) order
mediated by interlayer magnetic couplings. Large-scale density matrix
renormalization group calculations find algebraic pairing correlations with
Luttinger parameter of $K_{\rm SC} \simeq 1$. Infinite projected entangled-pair
state method obtains a non-zero SC order directly in the thermodynamic limit,
and estimates a strong pairing strength $\bar{\Delta}_z \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$.
Tangent-space tensor renormalization group simulations further determine a high
SC temperature $T_c^*/J \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$ and clarify the temperature
evolution of SC order. Due to the intriguing orbital selective behaviors and
strong Hund's rule coupling in the compound, $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ model has strong
interlayer spin exchange (while negligible interlayer hopping), which greatly
enhances the SC pairing in the bilayer system. Such a magnetically mediated
strong pairing has also been observed recently in the optical lattice of
ultracold atoms. Our accurate and comprehensive tensor-network calculations
reveal robust SC order in the bilayer $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ model and shed light on
the high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the pressurized nickelate
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in
Cu-substituted apatite (`LK99') has invigorated interest in the understanding
of what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature
superconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on
Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat
bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in
already established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of
these isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu
ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results
suggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy
physics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on
possible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite

We introduce a novel gauge-invariant, quantized interband index in
two-dimensional (2D) multiband systems. It provides a bulk topological
classification of a submanifold of parameter space (e.g., an electron valley in
a Brillouin zone), and therefore overcomes difficulties in characterizing
topology of submanifolds. We confirm its topological nature by numerically
demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence to the valley Chern number in $k\cdot
p$ models (e.g., gapped Dirac fermion model), and the first Chern number in
lattice models (e.g., Haldane model). Furthermore, we derive a band-resolved
topological charge and demonstrate that it can be used to investigate the
nature of edge states due to band inversion in valley systems like multilayer
graphene.
