<h3>An atomistic insight to moiré reconstruction in Twisted Bilayer  Graphene beyond magic angle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01310" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01310</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits electronic properties that are highly
correlated with the size and arrangement of moir\'e patterns. While rigid
rotation of two layers creates the topology of moir\'e patterns, local
rearrangements of the atoms due to interlayer van der Waals interactions result
in atomic reconstruction within the moir\'e cells. The ability to manipulate
these patterns by controlling twist angle and/or externally applied strain
provides a promising route to tune their properties. While this phenomenon has
been extensively studied for angles close to or smaller than the magic angle
({\theta}m=1.1{\deg}), its extent for higher angles and how it evolves with
strain is unknown and is believed to be mostly absent at high angles. We use
theoretical and numerical analyses to resolve reconstruction in angles above
{\theta}m using interpretive and fundamental physical measures. In addition, we
propose a method to identify local regions within moir\'e cells and track their
evolution with strain for a range of representative high twist angles. Our
results show that reconstruction is actively present beyond the magic angle and
its contribution to the evolution of the moir\'e cells is major. Our
theoretical method to correlate local and global phonon behavior provides
further validation on the role of reconstruction at higher angles. Our findings
provide a better understanding of moir\'e reconstruction in large twist angles
and the evolution of moir\'e cells in the presence of strain, that might be
very crucial for twistronics-based applications.

<h3>Mechanosensitive bonds induced complex cell motility patterns</h3>

<br>
<br>
The one-dimensional crawling movement of a cell is considered in this
theoretical study. Our active gel model shows that for a cell with weakly
mechanosensitive adhesion complexes, as myosin contractility increases, a cell
starts to move at a constant velocity. As the mechanosensitivity of the
adhesion complexes increases, a cell can exhibit stick-slip motion. Finally, a
cell with highly mechanosensitive adhesion complexes exhibits periodic
back-and-forth migration. A simplified model which assumes that the cell
crawling dynamics are controlled by the evolution of the myosin density dipole
and the asymmetry of adhesion complex distribution captures the motility
behaviors of crawling cells qualitatively. It suggests that the complex cell
crawling behaviors observed in the experiments could result from the interplay
between the distribution of contractile force and mechanosensitive bonds.

<h3>Bifurcation instructed design of multistate machines</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01507</a>
<br>
<i>Teaya Yang, David Hathcock, Yuchao Chen, Paul McEuen, James P. Sethna, Itai Cohen, Itay Griniasty</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a novel design paradigm for multistate machines where transitions
from one state to another are organized by bifurcations of multiple equilibria
of the energy landscape describing the collective interactions of the machine
components. This design paradigm is attractive since, near bifurcations, small
variations in a few control parameters can result in large changes to the
system's state providing an emergent lever mechanism. Further, the topological
configuration of transitions between states near such bifurcations ensures
robust operation, making the machine less sensitive to fabrication errors and
noise. To design such machines, we develop and implement a new efficient
algorithm that searches for interactions between the machine components that
give rise to energy landscapes with these bifurcation structures. We
demonstrate a proof of concept for this approach by designing magneto elastic
machines whose motions are primarily guided by their magnetic energy landscapes
and show that by operating near bifurcations we can achieve multiple transition
pathways between states. This proof of concept demonstration illustrates the
power of this approach, which could be especially useful for soft robotics and
at the microscale where typical macroscale designs are difficult to implement.

<h3>Enhancing the Accuracy of Density Functional Tight Binding Models  Through ChIMES Many-body Interaction Potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01733" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01733</a>
<br>
<i>Nir Goldman, Laurence E. Fried, Rebecca K. Lindsey, C. Huy Pham, R. Dettori</i>
<br>
<br>
Semi-empirical quantum models such as Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB)
are attractive methods for obtaining quantum simulation data at longer time and
length scale than possible with standard approaches. However, application of
these models can require lengthy effort due to the lack of a systematic
approach for their development. In this work, we discuss use of the Chebyshev
Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES) to create rapidly
parameterized DFTB models which exhibit strong transferability due to the
inclusion of many-body interactions that might otherwise be underestimated. We
apply our modeling approach to silicon polymorphs and review previous work on
titanium hydride. We also review creation of a general purpose DFTB/ChIMES
model for organic molecules and compounds that approaches hybrid functional and
coupled cluster accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than
similar neural network approaches. In all cases, DFTB/ChIMES yields similar
accuracy to the underlying quantum method with orders of magnitude improvement
in computational cost. Our developments provide a way to create computationally
efficient and highly accurate semi-empirical models for studies where physical
and chemical properties can be difficult to interrogate directly and there is
historically a significant reliance on theoretical approaches for
interpretation and validation of experimental results.

<h3>Strong correlation effects observed by an ANN-MFT encoder trained on  $α$-RuCl$_3$ high magnetic field data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01301</a>
<br>
<i>Michael J. Lawler, Kimberly A. Modic, B. J. Ramshaw</i>

$\alpha$-RuCl3 is a magnetic insulator exhibiting quantum spin liquid phases
possibly found in the Kitaev honeycomb model. Much of the effort towards
determining Hamiltonian parameters has focused on low magnetic field ordered
phases. We study this problem in the high magnetic field limit where mean-field
theory is better justified. We do so by machine-learning model parameters from
over 200,000 low dimensional data points by combining available magnetization,
torque, and torsion data sets. Our machine, an artificial neural
network-mean-field theory (ANN-MFT) encoder, maps thermodynamic conditions
(temperature and field vector) to model parameters via a fully connected
time-reversal covariant (equivariant) neural network and then predicts
observable values using mean-field theory. To train the machine, we use PyTorch
to enable backpropagation through mean-field theory with a pure PyTorch
implementation of the Newton-Raphson method. The results at $20$ K and $34.5$ T
are consistent with other parameter inference studies in the literature at low
magnetic field but strikingly have magnitudes that scale with temperature from
1.3 K up to 80 K in the $34.5-60$ T range. We conclude that the data presents
physics beyond the scope of the mean-field theory and that strong interactions
dominate the physics of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ up to field strengths of at least 60
Tesla.

<h3>SIR model on one dimensional small world networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01324</a>

We study the absorbing phase transition for the model of epidemic spreading,
Susceptible- Infected- Refractory (SIR), on one dimensional small world
networks. This model has been found to be in the universality class of the
dynamical percolation class, the mean field class corresponding to this model
is d = 6. The one dimensional case is special case of this class in which the
percolation threshold goes to one (boundary value) in the thermodynamic limit.
This behavior resembles slightly the behavior of one dimensional Ising and XY
models where the critical thresholds for both models go to zero temperature
(boundary value) in the thermodynamic limit. By analytical arguments and
numerical simulations we demonstrate that, increasing the connectivity (2k) of
this model on regular one dimensional lattice does not alter the criticality of
this model. Whereas we find that, this model crosses from a one dimensional
structure to mean field type for any finite value of the rewiring probability
(p), in manner is similarly to what happened in the Ising and XY models on
small world networks. In additional to that, we calculate the critical
exponents and the full critical phase space of this model on small world
network. We also introduce the crossover scaling function of this model from
one dimensional behavior to mean field behavior. Furthermore we reveal the
similarity between this model, and the Ising and XY models on the small world
networks.

<h3>Broadband Brillouin scattering study of ferroelectric instability of  barium sodium niobate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01341" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01341</a>

The barium sodium niobate (BNN) with tungsten-bronze structure is one of
well-known optical crystals for electro-optic and nonlinear optic applications.
This paper reviews the ferroelectric instability of BNN crystals. BNN is a
uniaxial ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization along the tetragonal
$c$-axis. There is no report on the observation of an optical soft mode
responsible for a ferroelectric phase transition. In the vicinity of the Curie
temperature, $T_{\text{C}}=560${\deg}C, an intense central peak (CP) related to
the polarization fluctuations along the $c$-axis was observed by the broadband
Brillouin scattering experiment. The relaxation time determined by the CP width
shows the critical slowing down towards $T_{\text{C}}$. This fact indicates
that the ferroelectric instability of BNN is an order-disorder type.

<h3>Vestigial singlet pairing in a fluctuating magnetic triplet  superconductor: Applications to graphene moiré systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01344" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01344</a>
<br>
<i>Prathyush P. Poduval, Mathias S. Scheurer</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the phenomenology of graphene moir\'e superlattices, we study a
2D model with strong tendencies towards both magnetism and triplet
superconductivity. Individually, their respective order parameters, $\vec{N}$
and $\vec{d}$, cannot order at finite temperature. Nonetheless, the model
exhibits a variety of vestigial phases, including charge-$4e$ superconductivity
and broken time-reversal symmetry. Our main focus is on a phase characterized
by finite $\vec{d} \cdot \vec{N}$, which has the same symmetries as the BCS
state, a Meissner effect, and metastable supercurrents, yet rather different
spectral properties: most notably, the suppression of the electronic density of
states at the Fermi can resemble that of either a fully gapped or nodal
superconductor, depending on parameters. This could provide a possible
explanation for recent tunneling experiments in graphene moir\'e systems.

<h3>Critical exponents of the order parameter of diffuse ferroelectric phase  transitions in the solid solutions based on lead germanate: studies of  optical rotation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01346" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01346</a>
<br>
<i>D. I. Adamenko, R. O. Vlokh</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we show that the critical exponents of the order parameter
(CEOPs) of diffuse ferroelectric phase transitions (DFEPTs) occurring in lead
germanate-based crystals can be determined using experimental temperature
dependences of their optical rotation. We also describe the approach that
suggests dividing a crystal sample into many homogeneous unit cells, each of
which is characterized by a non-diffuse phase transition with a specific local
Curie temperature. Using this approach, the CEOPs have been determined for the
pure Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$ crystals, the solid solutions
Pb$_{5}$(Ge$_{1-x}$Si$_{x}$)$_{3}$O$_{11}$ ($x = $0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40)
and (Pb$_{1-x}$Ba$_{x}$)$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$ ($x =$ 0.02, 0.05), and the
doped crystals Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$:Li$^{3+}$ (0.005 wt. %),
Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$:La$^{3+}$ (0.02 wt. %),
Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$:Eu$^{3+}$ (0.021 wt. %),
Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$:Li$^{3+}$, Bi$^{3+}$ (0.152 wt.~\%) and
Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$:Cu$^{2+}$ (0.14 wt. %). Comparison of our approach
with the other techniques used for determining the Curie temperatures and the
CEOPs of DFEPTs testifies to its essential advantages.

<h3>Gaussian-state Ansatz for the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum spin  lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01363</a>

<br>
<br>
The study of non-equilibrium dynamics is one of the most important challenges
of modern quantum many-body physics, in relationship with fundamental questions
in quantum statistical mechanics, as well as with the fields of quantum
simulation and computing. In this work we propose a Gaussian Ansatz for the
study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin systems. Within our
approach, the quantum spins are mapped onto Holstein-Primakoff bosons, such
that a coherent spin state -- chosen as the initial state of the dynamics --
represents the bosonic vacuum. The state of the system is then postulated to
remain a bosonic Gaussian state at all times, an assumption which is exact when
the bosonic Hamiltonian is quadratic; and which is justified in the case of a
nonlinear Hamiltonian if the boson density remains moderate. We test the
accuracy of such an Ansatz in the paradigmatic case of the $S=1/2$
transverse-field Ising model, in one and two dimensions, initialized in a state
aligned with the applied field. We show that the Gaussian Ansatz, when applied
to the bosonic Hamiltonian with nonlinearities truncated to quartic order, is
able to reproduce faithfully the evolution of the state, including its
relaxation to the equilibrium regime, for fields larger than the critical field
for the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the ground state. In
particular the spatio-temporal pattern of correlations reconstructed via the
Gaussian Ansatz reveals the dispersion relation of quasiparticle excitations,
exhibiting the softening of the excitation gap upon approaching the critical
field. Our results suggest that the Gaussian Ansatz correctly captures the
essential effects of nonlinearities in quantum spin dynamics; and that it can
be applied to the study of fundamental phenomena such as quantum thermalization
and its breakdown.

Understanding how molecules engage in collective motions in a liquid where a
network of bonds exists has both fundamental and applied relevance. On the one
hand, it can elucidate the ``ordering" role of long-range correlations in an
otherwise strongly dissipative system; on the other hand, it can inspire new
avenues to control such order to implement sound manipulation. Water represents
an ideal investigation case to unfold these general aspects and, across the
decades, it has been the focus of thorough scrutiny. Despite this investigative
effort, the spectrum of terahertz density fluctuations of water largely remains
a puzzle for Condensed Matter physicists. To unravel it, we compare previous
scattering measurements of water spectra with new ones on ice. Thanks to the
unique asset of Bayesian inference, we draw a more detailed portrayal of the
phonon response of ice. The comparison with the one of liquid water challenges
the current understanding of density fluctuations in water, or more in general,
of any networked liquid.

The purpose of this article is to develop a systematic approach to the
solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equation in terms of the magnon wave function
{\psi} (r) and apply it to physical phenomena in a thin ferromagnetic film.
This article has also a purpose to represent the modern state of art for the
properties of ferromagnetic films and the pumping-induced Bose-Einstein
condensation of magnons in them at room temperature. Thus, it can be considered
as a review on basic principles and the recent advances in the field.

The interplay of nontrivial topology and superconductivity in condensed
matter physics gives rise to exotic phenomena. However, materials are extremely
rare where it is possible to explore the full details of the superconducting
pairing. Here, we investigate the momentum dependence of the superconducting
gap distribution in a novel Dirac material PdTe. Using high resolution, low
temperature photoemission spectroscopy, we establish it as a spin-orbit coupled
Dirac semimetal with the topological Fermi arc crossing the Fermi level on the
(010) surface. This spin-textured surface state exhibits a fully gapped
superconducting Cooper pairing structure below Tc~4.5K. Moreover, we find a
node in the bulk near the Brillouin zone boundary, away from the topological
Fermi arc.These observations not only demonstrate the band resolved electronic
correlation between topological Fermi arc states and the way it induces Cooper
pairing in PdTe, but also provide a rare case where surface and bulk states
host a coexistence of nodeless and nodal gap structures enforced by spin-orbit
coupling.

<h3>Atomic-scale Modulation of Synthetic Magnetic Order in Oxide  Superlattices</h3>

Atomic-scale precision control of magnetic interactions facilitates a
synthetic spin order useful for spintronics, including advanced memory and
quantum logic devices. Conventional modulation of synthetic spin order has been
limited to metallic heterostructures that exploit RKKY interaction through a
nonmagnetic metallic spacer; however, they face problems arising from Joule
heating and/or electric breakdown. The practical realization and observation of
a synthetic spin order across a nonmagnetic insulating spacer would lead to the
development of spin-related devices with a completely different concept.
Herein, we report the atomic-scale modulation of the synthetic spiral spin
order in oxide superlattices composed of ferromagnetic metal and nonmagnetic
insulator layers. The atomically controlled superlattice exhibit an oscillatory
magnetic behavior, representing the existence of a spiral spin structure.
Depth-sensitive polarized neutron reflectometry evidences modulated spiral spin
structures as a function of the nonmagnetic insulator layer thickness.
Atomic-scale customization of the spin state could lead the field one step
further to actual spintronic applications.

<h3>Atomic and Electronic Structures of Correlated SrRuO3/SrTiO3  Superlattices</h3>

<br>
Atomic-scale precision epitaxy of perovskite oxide superlattices provides
unique opportunities for controlling the correlated electronic structures,
activating effective control knobs for intriguing functionalities including
electromagnetic, thermoelectric, and electrocatalytic behaviors. In this study,
we investigated the close interplay between the atomic and electronic
structures of correlated superlattices synthesized by atomic-scale precision
epitaxy. In particular, we employ superlattices composed of correlated magnetic
SrRuO3 (SRO) and quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 (STO) layers. In those
superlattices, RuO6 octahedral distortion is systematically controlled from 167
to 175 degrees depending on the thickness of the STO layers, also affecting the
TiO6 octahedral distortion within the STO layer. Customized octahedral
distortion within SRO/STO superlattices in turn modifies the electronic
structures of both the Ti and Ru compounds, observed by X-ray absorption
spectroscopy. Our results identify the close correlation between atomic lattice
and electronic structures enabled by the facile controllability of atomic-scale
epitaxy, which would be useful for designing future correlated oxide devices.

<h3>Dynamics of correlation spreading in low-dimensional transverse-field  Ising models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01407" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01407</a>
<br>
<i>Ryui Kaneko, Ippei Danshita</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the dynamical spreading of spatial correlations after a
quantum quench starting from a magnetically disordered state in the
transverse-field Ising model at one (1D) and two spatial dimensions (2D). We
analyze specifically the longitudinal and transverse spin-spin correlation
functions at equal time with use of several methods. From the comparison of the
results in 1D obtained by the linear spin-wave approximation (LSWA) and those
obtained by the rigorous analytical approach, we show that the LSWA can
asymptotically reproduce the exact group velocity in the limit of strong
transverse fields while it fails to capture the detailed time dependence of the
correlation functions. By applying the LSWA to the 2D case, in which the
rigorous analytical approach is unavailable, we estimate the propagation
velocity to be $Ja/(2\hbar)$ at the strong-field limit, where $J$ is the Ising
interaction and $a$ is the lattice spacing. We also utilize the tensor-network
method based on the projected-entangled pair states for 2D and quantitatively
compute the time evolution of the correlation functions for a relatively short
time. Our findings provide useful benchmarks for quantum simulation experiments
of correlation spreading and theoretical refinement of the Lieb-Robinson bound
in the future.

<h3>Renormalizing Antiferroelectric Nanostripes in  $β'-\mathrm{In}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ via Optomechanics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01425" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01425</a>

<br>
<br>
Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials have received tremendous attention owing to
their high energy conversion efficiency and good tunability. Recently, an
exotic two-dimensional (2D) AFE material,
$\beta'-\mathrm{In}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$ monolayer that could host atomically
thin AFE nanostripe domains has been experimentally synthesized and
theoretically examined. In this work, we apply first-principles calculations
and theoretical estimations to predict that light irradiation can control the
nanostripe width of such a system. We suggest that an intermediate
near-infrared light (below bandgap) could effectively harness the thermodynamic
Gibbs free energy, and the AFE nanostripe width will gradually reduce. We also
propose to use an above bandgap linearly polarized light to generate AFE
nanostripespecific photocurrent, providing an all-optical pump-probe setup for
such AFE nanostripe width phase transitions.

<h3>Layer-number-dependent spin Hall effects in transition metal  monocarbides $M_{2}\rm{C}$ ($M=\rm{V}, \rm{Nb}, \rm{Ta}$)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01436" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01436</a>
<br>
<i>Xi Zuo, Yulin Feng, Na Liu, Bing Huang, Desheng Liu, Bin Cui</i>
<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of strong spin Hall effects (SHE) in 2D layered
topological semimetals has attracted intensive attention due to its exotic
electronic properties and potential applications in spintronic devices. In this
paper, we systematically study the topological properties and intrinsic SHE of
layered transition metal carbides $M_{2}\rm{C}$ ($M=\rm{V}, \rm{Nb}, \rm{Ta}$).
The results show that both bulk and monolayer $M_{2}\rm{C}$ have
symmetry-protected nodal points (NPs) and lines (NLs) originating from the $d$
band crossing near the Fermi level ($E_F$). The inclusion of SOC breaks the
degeneracy of NLs and NPs, contributing to large spin Hall conductivity (SHC)
up to $\sim$1100 and $\sim$200 $(\hbar / e)(\Omega \mathrm{cm})^{-1}$ for bulk
and monolayer Ta$_{2}$C, respectively. Remarkably, we find that magnitude of
SHC exhibits a significant enhancement by increasing the layer number. For
eight-layer Ta$_{2}$C, the maximum value of SHC can reach up to $\sim$600
$(\hbar / e)(\Omega \mathrm{cm})^{-1}$, comparable to many reported 3D
topological materials. Analysis of spin Berry curvature reveals that the large
SHC originates from layer-number-dependent nodal line structure near the $E_F$,
in which the repeated crossover between valence and conduction bands creates
large amounts of NPs along the $\Gamma\rm{-K}$ route. Our findings not only
provide a new platform for experimental research of low-dimensional SHE, but
also suggest an effective way of realizing giant SHE by controlling layer
thickness.

<h3>Magnetic properties of the layered heavy fermion antiferromagnet  CePdGa$_6$</h3>

<i>H. Q. Ye, T. Le, H. Su, Y. N. Zhang, S. S. Luo, M. J. Gutmann, H. Q. Yuan, M. Smidman</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the magnetic properties of the layered heavy fermion
antiferromagnet CePdGa$_{6}$, and their evolution upon tuning with the
application of magnetic field and pressure. CePdGa$_{6}$ orders
antiferromagnetically below $T\rm_{N}$ = 5.2 K, where there is evidence for
heavy fermion behavior from an enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient. Our results are
best explained by a magnetic ground state of ferromagnetically coupled layers
of Ce $4f$-moments orientated along the $c$-axis, with antiferromagnetic
coupling between layers. At low temperatures we observe two metamagnetic
transitions for fields applied along the $c$-axis corresponding to spin-flip
transitions, where the lower transition is to a different magnetic phase with a
magnetization one-third of the saturated value. From our analysis of the
magnetic susceptibility, we propose a CEF level scheme which accounts for the
Ising anisotropy at low temperatures, and we find that the evolution of the
magnetic ground state can be explained considering both antiferromagnetic
exchange between nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor layers, indicating
the influence of long-range interactions. Meanwhile we find little change of
$T\rm_{N}$ upon applying hydrostatic pressures up to 2.2 GPa, suggesting that
significantly higher pressures are required to examine for possible quantum
critical behaviors.

<br>
<br>
The superconducting order parameter of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor
LaRhSn is investigated by means of low temperature measurements of the specific
heat, muon-spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR) and the tunnel-diode oscillator
(TDO) based method. The specific heat and magnetic penetration depth
[$\lambda(T)$] show an exponentially activated temperature dependence,
demonstrating fully gapped superconductivity in LaRhSn. The temperature
dependence of $\lambda^{-2}(T)$ deduced from the TDO based method and $\mu$SR
show nearly identical behavior, which can be well described by a single-gap
$s$-wave model, with a zero temperature gap value of $\Delta(0)=1.77(4)k_BT_c$.
The zero-field $\mu$SR spectra do not show detectable changes upon cooling
below $T_c$, and therefore there is no evidence for time-reversal-symmetry
breaking in the superconducting state.

The Wigner crystal, an ordered array of electrons, is one of the very first
proposed many-body phases stabilized by the electron-electron interaction. This
electron solid phase has been reported in ultra-clean two-dimensional electron
systems at extremely low temperatures, where the Coulomb interaction dominants
over the kinetic energy, disorder potential and thermal fluctuation. We closely
examine this quantum phase with capacitance measurements where the device
length-scale is comparable with the crystal's correlation length. The
extraordinarily high performance of our technique makes it possible to
quantitatively study the dynamic response of the Wigner crystal within the
single crystal regime. Our result will greatly boost the study of this
inscrutable electron solid.

<h3>Magnetization dynamics with time-dependent spin-density functional  theory: significance of exchange-correlation torques</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01509" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01509</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In spin-density-functional theory (SDFT) for noncollinear magnetic materials,
the Kohn-Sham system features exchange-correlation (xc) scalar potentials and
magnetic fields. The significance of the xc magnetic fields is not very well
explored; in particular, they can give rise to local torques on the
magnetization, which are absent in standard local and semilocal approximations.
Exact benchmark solutions for a five-site extended Hubbard lattice at half
filling and in the presence of spin-orbit coupling are compared with SDFT
results obtained using orbital-dependent exchange-only approximations. The
magnetization dynamics following short-pulse excitations is found to be
reasonably well described in the exchange-only approximation for weak to
moderate interactions. For stronger interactions and near transitions between
magnetically ordered and frustrated phases, exchange and correlation torques
tend to compensate each other and must both be accounted for.

<br>
<br>
Two-impurity Kondo models are paradigmatic for correlated spin-fermion
systems. Working with Mn atoms on Au(111) covered by a monolayer of MoS$_2$, we
tune the inter-adatom exchange via the adatom distance and the adatom-substrate
exchange via the location relative to a moir\'e structure of the substrate.
Differential-conductance measurements on isolated adatoms exhibit Kondo peaks
with heights depending on the adatom location relative to the moir\'e
structure. Mn dimers spaced by a few atomic lattice sites exhibit split Kondo
resonances. In contrast, adatoms in closely spaced dimers couple
antiferromagnetically, resulting in a molecular-singlet ground state. Exciting
the singlet-triplet transition by tunneling electrons, we find that the
singlet-triplet splitting is surprisingly sensitive to the moir\'e structure.
We interpret our results theoretically by relating the variations in the
singlet-triplet splitting to the heights of the Kondo peaks of single adatoms,
finding evidence for coupling of the adatom spin to multiple conduction
electron channels.

Dielectric permittivity was studied in ceramics of relaxor ferroelectric
bismuth-sodium titanate Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_{3}$. The measurements were
performed on as sintered and heat treated in vacuum samples. The diffuse
dielectric anomalies associated with the structural phase transitions were
observed in as sintered samples. The intense peak of permittivity ($
\varepsilon_{\text{max}} \sim 10^{4}$) appeared after heat treating in vacuum.
The anomaly of $\varepsilon(T)$ was contributed by slow polarization processes
($f<10$ kHz) and was non-stable, vanishing on heating in air up to $\sim 800$
K. Temperature and frequency dependencies of $\varepsilon$ were described by
using Cole-Cole model with accounting thermally stimulated decay of the
non-stable polarization. It is supposed that the dielectric anomaly is
determined by space charge polarization mechanism. Oxygen vacancies
V$_{\rm{O}}^{\bullet \bullet}$ and electrons localized on titanium ions
Ti$'_{\rm{Ti}}$
are assumed to be responsible for the phenomenon observed.

<h3>Slow and fast relaxation times of quantum lattice model with local  multi-well potentials: phenomenological dynamics for Sn$_{2}$P$_{2}$S$_{6}$  ferroelectric crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
As a continuation of the previously published work [Velychko O. V., Stasyuk
I. V., Phase Transitions, 2019, 92, 420], a phenomenological framework for the
relaxation dynamics of quantum lattice model with multi-well potentials is
given in the case of deformed Sn$_{2}$P$_{2}$S$_{6}$ ferroelectric lattice. The
framework is based on the combination of statistical equilibrium theory and
irreversible thermodynamics. In order to study these dynamics in a connected
way we assume that the dipole ordering or polarization ($\eta$) and volume
deformation ($u$) can be treated as fluxes and forces in the sense of Onsager
theory. From the linear relations between the forces and fluxes, the rate
equations are derived and characterized by two relaxation times ($\tau_{S},
\tau_{F}$) which describe the irreversible process near the equilibrium states.
The behaviors of $\tau_{S}$ and $\tau_{F}$ in the vicinity of ferroelectric
phase transitions are studied.

<h3>Path integral Monte Carlo simulations of the geometrical effects in KDP  crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations with very simple models were
used in order to unveil the physics behind the isotope effects in H-bonded
ferroelectrics. First, we studied geometrical effects in the H-bonds caused by
deuteration with a general three-site model based on a back-to-back double
Morse potential plus a Morse potential between oxygens, fitted to explain
different general features for a wide set of H-bonded compounds. Our model
results show the Ubbelohde or geometrical effect (GE), i.e., the expansion of
the H-bond with deuteration, in agreement to what is observed in H-bonded
ferroelectrics with short H-bonds. Moreover, adjusting the potential parameters
to ab initio results, we have developed a 1D model which considers the bilinear
proton-proton interaction in mean-field to study nuclear quantum effects that
give rise to the GE in KDP crystals. PIMC simulations reveal that protons
tunnel more efficiently than deuterons along the 1D chain, giving rise to a
strong attraction center that pulls the oxygens together. This mechanism, which
is based on the correlation between tunneling and geometrial modifications of
the H-bonds, leads to a strong GE in the ordered phase of the chain at low
temperature which is in good agreement with the experimental data.

<br>
We develop a shell model (SM) for potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) which
is fitted to ab initio (AI) results that include nonlocal van der Waals
corrections. The SM is comprehensively tested by comparing results of
structural, vibrational and ferroelectric properties with AI and experimental
data. The relaxed structural parameters are in very good agreement with the AI
results and the available experimental data. The $\Gamma$-point phonons and the
total phonon densities of states (DOSs) in the ferroelectric and paraelectric
phases calculated with the developed SM are in good overall agreement with the
corresponding AI and experimental data. We also compute the effective Debye
temperature as a function of $T$ which shows good accordance with the
corresponding AI and experimental results. Classical molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations obtained with the developed SM show a FE-PE phase transition at
$\approx 360$ K in remarkable agreement with ab initio MD calculations.

<br>
<br>
Using the previously developed model we revisit the problem of the electric
field induced polarization rotation in antiferroelectric crystals of squaric
acid. We test an alternative set of the model parameters, according to which
the dipole moments associated with the H$_2$C$_4$O$_4$ groups are assumed to be
parallel to the diagonals of the $ac$ plane. The $T$-$E$ phase diagrams and the
polarization curves $P(E)$ for the fields directed along the $a$ axis and along
one of the diagonals are considered. Comparison of the theoretical results with
the newly published experimental data confirm the validity of the model. The
calculations reveal no apparent advantage of the new set of the parameters over
the previously used set.

<br>
To investigate the caloric effects in the CsH$_2$PO$_4$ ferroelectric, a
modified pseudospin model of this crystal is used, which takes into account the
dependence of the parameters of interaction between pseudospins on lattice
strains. The model also takes into account the dependence of the effective
dipole moment of a pseudospin on the order parameter. In the two-particle
cluster approximation, the influence of the longitudinal electric field and
hydrostatic pressure on the molar entropy of the crystal was studied. The
electrocaloric and barocaloric effects were studied. The calculated
electrocaloric temperature change is about $1$ K; it can change its sign under
the influence of hydrostatic pressure. Barocaloric temperature change is about
$-0.5$ K; lattice anharmonicities were not taken into account in its
calculations.

We have studied the composition dependence of density of liquid water-DMSO
mixtures at different temperatures by using the isobaric-isothermal (NPT)
molecular dynamics computer simulations. The non-polarizable semi-flexible, P1
and P2 models for the DMSO molecule combined with the TIP4P-2005 water model
are considered. The excess mixing volume and the apparent molar volumes of the
species are reported. We have established that the P1-TIP4P-2005 model for the
mixture provides a very good description of the location of the minimum of
apparent molar volume for DMSO species indicating the anomaly. Most important
is that the temperature interval where the hydrophobic effect exists, is
correctly captured with this modelling, in contrast to the P2-TIP4P-2005 model.

<h3>Universal to Non-Universal Transition of the statistics of Rare Events  During the Spread of Random Walks</h3>

<br>
<i>R. K. Singh, Stanislav Burov</i>
<br>
<br>
Particle hopping is a common feature in heterogeneous media. We explore such
motion by using the widely applicable formalism of the continuous time random
walk and focus on the statistics of rare events. Numerous experiments have
shown that the decay of the positional probability density function P (X, t),
describing the statistics of rare events, exhibits universal exponential decay.
We show that such universality ceases to exist once the threshold of
exponential distribution of particle hops is crossed. While the mean hop is not
diverging and can attain a finite value; the transition itself is critical. The
exponential universality of rare events arises due to the contribution of all
the different states occupied during the process. Once the reported threshold
is crossed, a single large event determines the statistics. In this realm, the
big jump principle replaces the large deviation principle, and the spatial part
of the decay is unaffected by the temporal properties of rare events.

<br>
We study the temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity along the
polar axis for ferroelectric ammonium fluoroberyllate (AFB) crystal in the
vicinity of its phase transition points. The experimental data within
incommensurately modulated phase of AFB is compared with the predictions of
phenomenological models known from the literature: the Curie-Weiss (CW) law,
the generalized Curie-Weiss (GCW) law, and the models by Levanyuk and Sannikov
(LS) and by Prelov\v{s}ek, Levstik and Filipi\v{c} (PLF) suggested for improper
ferroelectrics. It is shown that the LS approach describes the temperature
behavior of the dielectric permittivity for the AFB crystal better than the CW,
GWC and PLF models. The main physical reasons of this situation are elucidated.

In this paper we present a new integrable deformation of the Hubbard model.
Our deformation gives rise to a range 3 interaction term in the Hamiltonian
which does not preserve spin or particle number. This is the first non-trivial
medium range deformation of the Hubbard model that is integrable. Our model can
be mapped to a new integrable nearest-neighbour model via a duality
transformation. The resulting nearest-neighbour model also breaks spin
conservation. We compute the $R$-matrices for our models, and find that there
is a very unusual dependence on the spectral parameters in terms of the
elliptic amplitude.

Exciton condensation, a Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons into a single
quantum state, has recently been achieved in low-dimensional materials
including twin layers of graphene and van der Waals heterostructures. Here we
examine computationally the beginnings of exciton condensation in a double
layer comprised of coronene, a seven-benzene-ring patch of graphene. As a
function of interlayer separation, we compute the exciton population in a
single coherent quantum state, showing that the population peaks around 1.8 at
distances near 2 \AA. Visualization reveals interlayer excitons at the
separation distance of the condensate. We determine the exciton population as a
function of the twist angle between the two coronene layers to reveal the magic
angles at which the condensation peaks. As with previous recent calculations
showing some exciton condensation in hexacene double layers and benzene stacks,
the present two-electron reduced-density-matrix calculations with coronene
provide computational evidence for the ability to realize exciton condensation
in molecular-scale analogs of extended systems like the graphene double layer.

Adhesion between two surfaces depend on the chemical and the mechanical
properties of both the materials. However, heterogeneities (surface or bulk)
affect the adhesion between the two surfaces tremendously. In this work, we
study the role of externally deposited nanoscale heterogeneities on their
adhesion behavior. Silica nanoparticles in the bulk polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
polymer matrix act as external heterogeneities, which subsequently affect their
adhesion. The nanoscale heterogeneities change the polymer environment locally,
which subsequently modify its mechanical properties, e.g. elastic modulus, as a
result, it affects its adhesion behavior. We observe that the adhesion behavior
vary in nonlinear manner with increasing nanoparticle concentration. Therefore,
probing these heterogeneities may allow us to understand the emergence of
processing-induced deviations and the role of external defects in the
macroscopic properties of a polymer.

Kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) with a V-Kagome lattice acting as a
fertile platform to investigate geometric frustration, electron correlation,
superconductivity, and nontrivial band topology, have attracted tremendous
attention. Here we reported the structure and properties of ATi3Bi5 (A = Rb,
Cs) family with a Ti-Kagome lattice, specifically focusing on the electronic
structure and nontrivial band topology of RbTi3Bi5. ATi3Bi5 (A = Rb, Cs) is
found to be non-superconducting metal with strong quasi-two-dimensional
feature, moderate electron correlation, and small Pauli paramagnetism. Based on
first principles calculations, RbTi3Bi5 is determined to be a weak topological
insulator with gapless surface states along (100) plane, and the electronic
band structure along (001) plane is in great agreement with experimentally
observed one. In particular, the electronic properties of the RbTi3Bi5
monolayer can be efficiently tuned by a biaxial strain according to
calculation, with its lower saddle points coming from Kagome lattice
approaching the Fermi level. These results highlight ATi3Bi5 (A = Rb, Cs) with

Recent research suggests that when a system has a "false time reversal
violation" the Onsager reciprocity relations hold despite the presence of a
magnetic field. The purpose of this work is to clarify that the Onsager
relations may well be violated in presence of a "false time reversal
violation": that rather guarantees the validity of distinct relations, which we
dub "false Onsager relations". We also point out that for quantum systems
"false time reversal violation" is omnipresent and comment that, per se, this
has in general no consequence in regard to the validity of Onsager relations,
or the more general non-equilibrium fluctuation relations, in presence of a
magnetic field. Our arguments are illustrated with the Heisenberg model of a
magnet in an external magnetic field.

Increasing the separation between semiconductor quantum dots offers scaling
advantages by fa- cilitating gate routing and the integration of sensors and
charge reservoirs. Elongated quantum dots have been utilized for this purpose
in GaAs heterostructures to extend the range of spin-spin interactions. Here,
we study a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device where two quantum dot arrays
are separated by an elongated quantum dot (340 nm long, 50 nm wide). We monitor
charge transitions of the elongated quantum dot by measuring radiofrequency
single-electron currents to a reservoir to which we connect a lumped-element
resonator. We operate the dot as a single electron box to achieve charge
sensing of remote quantum dots in each array, separated by a distance of 510
nm. Simultaneous charge detection on both ends of the elongated dot
demonstrates that the charge is well distributed across its nominal length,
supported by the simulated quantum-mechanical electron density. Our results
illustrate how single-electron boxes can be realised with versatile foot-
prints that may enable novel and compact quantum processor layouts, offering
distributed charge sensing in addition to the possibility of mediated coupling.

In complex colloidal systems, interparticle interactions strongly affect the
dynamics of the constituting particles. A study of the dynamical response also
provides invaluable information on the character of those interactions. Here we
demonstrate how tuning the electrostatic interactions by an ionic surfactant in
dispersions of magnetic nanoplatelets leads to developing new dynamic modes in
magnetic response spectra. The collective modes can be induced or suppressed by
either varying the concentration ratio of the magnetic nanoplatelets (MP) to
the surfactant or increasing the MP concentration reflecting the nanoscale
characteristics of this fluid magnet.

High quality, ultrathin, superconducting films are required for advanced
devices such as hot-electron bolometers, superconducting nanowire single photon
detectors, and quantum applications. Using Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor
Deposition (HPCVD), we show that MgB2 films as thin as 4 nm can be fabricated
on the carbon terminated 6H-SiC (0001) surface with a superconducting
transition temperature above 33K and a rms roughness of 0.7 nm. Remarkably, the
film quality is a function of the SiC surface termination, with the
C-terminated surface preferred to the Si-terminated surface. To understand the
MgB2 thin film/ SiC substrate interactions giving rise to this difference, we
characterized the interfacial structures using Rutherford backscattering
spectroscopy/channeling, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy. The MgB2/SiC interface structure is complex and
different for the two terminations. Both terminations incorporate substantial
unintentional oxide layers influencing MgB2 growth and morphology, but with
different extent, intermixing and interface chemistry. In this paper, we report
measurements of transport, resistivity, and critical superconducting
temperature of MgB2/SiC that are different for the two terminations, and link
interfacial structure variations to observed differences. The result shows that
the C face of SiC is a preferred substrate for the deposition of ultrathin
superconducting MgB2 films.

Atomic-scale engineering typically involves bottom-up approaches, leveraging
parameters such as temperature, partial pressures, and chemical affinity to
promote spontaneous arrangement of atoms. These parameters are applied
globally, resulting in atomic scale features scattered probabilistically
throughout the material. In a top-down approach, different regions of the
material are exposed to different parameters resulting in structural changes
varying on the scale of the resolution. In this work, we combine the
application of global and local parameters in an aberration corrected scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM) to demonstrate atomic scale precision
patterning of atoms in twisted bilayer graphene. The focused electron beam is
used to define attachment points for foreign atoms through the controlled
ejection of carbon atoms from the graphene lattice. The sample environment is
staged with nearby source materials, such that the sample temperature can
induce migration of the source atoms across the sample surface. Under these
conditions, the electron-beam (top-down) enables carbon atoms in the graphene
to be replaced spontaneously by diffusing adatoms (bottom-up). Using
image-based feedback-control, arbitrary patterns of atoms and atom clusters are
attached to the twisted bilayer graphene with limited human interaction. The
role of substrate temperature on adatom and vacancy diffusion is explored by
first-principles simulations.

Isolated quantum many-body systems are often well-described by the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis. There are, however, mechanisms that cause different
behavior: many-body localization and quantum many-body scars. Here, we show how
one can find disordered Hamiltonians hosting a tower of scars by adapting a
known method for finding parent Hamiltonians. Using this method, we construct a
spin-1/2 model which is both partially localized and contains scars. We
demonstrate that the model is partially localized by studying numerically the
level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement entropy. As disorder is
introduced, the adjacent gap ratio transitions from the Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble to the Poisson distribution and the entropy shifts from volume-law to
area law scaling. We investigate the properties of scars in a partially
localized background and compare with a thermal background. At strong disorder,
states initialized inside or outside the scar subspace display different
dynamical behavior but have similar entanglement entropy. We demonstrate that
localization stabilizes scar revivals of initial states with support both
inside and outside the scar subspace. Finally, we show how strong disorder
introduces additional towers of approximate scar states.

We establish in one dimension a general mapping of mosaic models with

points of localization are already known. The mapping gives birth to the
mobility edges of these nonreciprocal mosaic models and even the Lyapunov
exponents if the non-mosaic counterpart is given. For demonstrations, we take
an Aubry-Andre-like model with complex quasiperiodic potentials and the
Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma model to show the mapping's validity, successfully
obtaining the mobility edges and the Lyapunov exponents of their nonreciprocal
mosaic counterparts. This general mapping may pave the way of studying mobility
edges, Lyapunov exponents, and in principle other important quantities of
nonreciprocal mosaic models.

We study two-dimensional (2D) anisotropic droplets of non-interacting
electrons in the lowest Landau level, confined by trapping potentials whose
level curves have an arbitrary shape at large distances. Using semiclassical
methods, we show that energy eigenstates are localized on equipotentials of the
trap, with angle-dependent local widths and heights. We exploit this
one-particle insight to deduce explicit formulas for many-body observables in
the thermodynamic limit. For instance, the droplet's density falls off at the
boundary with an angle-dependent width inherited from that of the underlying
wave functions, while the many-body current is localized on the edge, to which
it is tangent. Correlations along the edge are long-ranged, in accordance with
the system's low-energy edge modes which are described by a free chiral
conformal field theory in terms of the angle variable of the trapping
potential. These results are likely to be observable in solid-state systems or
quantum simulators of 2D electron gases with a high degree of control on the
confining potential.

This paper presents an efficient and quantitative phase-field model for
elastically heterogeneous alloys that ensures the two mechanical
compatibilities$\unicode{x2014}$static and kinematic, in conjunction with
chemical equilibrium within the interfacial region. Our model contrasts with
existing phase-field models that either violate static compatibility or
interfacial chemical equilibrium or are computationally costly. For
computational efficiency, the partial rank-one homogenization (PRH) scheme is
employed to enforce both static and kinematic compatibilities at the interface.
Moreover, interfacial chemical equilibrium is ensured by replacing the
composition field with the diffusion potential field as the independent
variable of the model. Its performance is demonstrated by simulating four
single-particle and one multi-particle cases for two binary two-phase alloys:
Ni-Al $\gamma^{\prime}/\gamma$ and UO$_2$/void. Its accuracy is then
investigated against analytical solutions. For the single-particle
$\gamma^{\prime}/\gamma$ alloy, we find that the accuracy of the phase-field
results remains unaffected for both planar and non-planar geometries when the
PRH scheme is employed. Fortuitously, in the UO$_2$/void simulations, despite a
strong elastic heterogeneity$\unicode{x2014}$the ratio of Young's modulus of
the void phase to that of the UO$_2$ phase is $10^{-4}\unicode{x2014}$we find
that the PRH scheme shows significantly better convergence compared to the
Voigt-Taylor scheme (VTS) for both planar and non-planar geometries.
Nevertheless, for the same interface width range as in the $\gamma^{'}/\gamma$
case, the interface migration in these simulations shows dependence on
interface width. Contrary to the $\gamma^{\prime}/\gamma$ simulations, we also
find that the simulated elastic fields show deviations from the analytical
solution in the non-planar UO$_2$/void case using the PRH scheme.

Engineering alloys generally exhibit multi-phase microstructures. For
simulating their microstructure evolution during solid-state phase
transformation, CALPHAD-guided multi-phase-field models coupled with
micro-mechanics have proven to be a reliable simulation tool. Nevertheless,
their efficiency and accuracy still depend on the homogenization scheme used to
interpolate the elastic properties in the interfacial regions. In this paper,
we present a phase-field model for multi-phase and multi-component solids using
a partial rank-one homogenization scheme that enforces static and kinematic
compatibilities in the interfacial regions. To this end, we first extend the
rank-one homogenization scheme to multi-phase systems. Moreover, for
computational efficiency, we analytically solve the static compatibility
equations for linear elastic three-phase solids. For quantitative accuracy, a
coupling technique is used to extract the prerequisite thermodynamic and
kinetic properties from CALPHAD databases. The model is solved numerically in
an open source finite-element framework. As numerical applications, the
microstructure of two elastically stressed intermetallic-containing three-phase
alloys: Ni-Al and Al-Cr-Ni, are simulated. The accuracy of the model is
verified against analytically obtained solutions for planar and concentric ring
interfaces. We show that the simulation results remain unaltered with varying
interface width. Except for one simulation, all cases show better or nearly
equal convergence using the partial rank-one scheme compared to the
Voigt-Taylor scheme.

Many-body localized phases retain memory of their initial conditions and have
been shown to exist in disordered interacting systems with unitary dynamics.
The stability of the localized phase due to the breakdown of unitarity is of
relevance to experiment when coupling to the environment is taken into account.
Motivated by this, we investigate the impact of non-Hermitian perturbations on
many-body localization. We focus on the interacting Hatano-Nelson model which
breaks unitarity via asymmetric hopping. We explore the phase diagram for the
mid-spectrum eigenstates as a function of the interaction strength and the
non-Hermiticity. In contrast to the single-particle case, our findings are
consistent with a two-step approach to the localized regime. We also study the
dynamics of the particle imbalance starting from an initial density wave,
focusing on disorder realizations with complex eigenvalues. The time to reach
the steady state in the localized phase is clustered around the inverse of the
extremal eigenvalue, in contrast to the ergodic phase which shows a broader
distribution of timescales. Our findings suggest the possibility of novel
dynamical regimes in disordered open systems.
