<h3>A Method for Investigating Thermodynamics of Inaccessible Objects by  Determining the Co-Amoeba of their Partition Functions</h3>

Given an Ising-type system, the zeros of its complexified partition function,
known as Lee--Yang zeros, form an algebraic variety that sheds light on the
thermodynamics of that system. But in practice, we often confront with the
inaccessibility of a system for direct experimentation and then a strategic
approach is taken to investigate a probe that is interacting with the target
system. Considering such an inaccessible system, reading the probe alone, we
present a method to determine the co-amoeba, the images of the argument map of
an algebraic variety corresponding to the Lee--Yang zeros of its partition
function. In our method, starting from thermal equilibrium of target and probe,
the target can be effectively initiated at any chosen value of its internal
parameters by doing operations only on the probe. Thus, sampling the co-amoeba
corresponding to a wide of range of physical parameters is possible which
allows one to perceive the full algebraic variety and thereby determining the
thermodynamics of the system. No prior knowledge about the internal parameters,
neither any control over the target system under investigation is required for
this protocol. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this protocol via the
nuclear magnetic resonance architecture using a system of three mutually
interacting spin-1/2 nuclei.

<h3>Enhancing the Capture of Magnetic Nanoparticles Inside of Ferromagnetic  Nanostructures Using External Magnetic Fields</h3>

The influence of an external magnetic field upon the capture of 130 nm
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) by ferromagnetic nanostructures was investigated.
The magnetophoretic forces acting upon a nanoparticle were simulated in
external magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to ferromagnetic
nanostructures consisting of arrays of antidots and dots. Changing the
direction of the external field was found to dramatically alter the
magnetophoretic forces acting on the particle and the trajectories of the MNPs.
A field parallel to the nanostructures' surfaces generated magnetophoretic
forces that directed the nanoparticle into the nanostructures. A perpendicular
field produced forces directing particles onto the structures' surfaces.
Nanostructures were etched into the surfaces of Permalloy films using ion beam
lithography. MNPs were then deposited onto the films' surfaces under a parallel
or perpendicular magnetic field. The distributions of particles in the
nanostructures were analysed to obtain the capture efficiencies of each
structure which indicate the proportion of particles trapped inside. Without an
external field, the highest efficiency was displayed by arrays of circular
antidots with circular dot arrays displaying the lowest. Antidot arrays
displayed higher capture efficiencies than dot arrays. Addition of a field
parallel to the surface significantly increased the capture efficiencies and
addition of a field perpendicular to the surface decreased the efficiencies.
Under the perpendicular field, the particles were instead caught on the outer
edges of the nanostructures. These results suggest that application of a
parallel external magnetic field promotes the capture of MNPs within
ferromagnetic nanostructures and a perpendicular field increases the capture of
MNPs onto the outer surface and edges of nanostructures.

A class of antiferromagnets with spin-polarized electron bands, yet zero net
magnetization, called altermagnets is attracting increasing attention due to
their potential use in spintronics. Here, we study spin injection into an
altermagnet via spin pumping from a ferromagnetic insulator. We find that the
spin pumping behaves qualitatively different depending on how the altermagnet
is crystallographically oriented relative the interface to the ferromagnetic
insulator. The altermagnetic state can enhance or suppress spin pumping, which
we explain in terms of spin-split altermagnetic band structure and the
spin-flip probability for the incident modes. Including the effect of
interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that the spin-pumping effect is
in general magnified, but that it can display a non-monotonic behavior as a
function of the spin-orbit coupling strength. We show that there exists an
optimal value of the spin-orbit coupling strength which causes an order of
magnitude increase in the pumped spin current, even for the crystallographic
orientation of the altermagnet which suppresses the spin pumping.

Resonant transport occurs when there is a matching of frequencies across some
spatial medium, increasing the efficiency of shuttling particles from one
reservoir to another. We demonstrate that in a periodically driven, many--body
titled lattice there are sets of spatially fractured resonances. These
``emanate'' from two essential resonances due to scattering off internal
surfaces created when the driving frequency and many--body interaction strength
vary, a scattering reminiscent of lens flare. The confluence of these fractured
resonances dramatically enhances transport. At one confluence, the interaction
strength is finite and the essential resonance arises due to the interplay of
interaction with the counter--rotating terms of the periodic drive. The other
forms where several paths split by the many--body interaction merge in the
non--interacting limit. We discuss the origin and structure of the fractured
resonances, as well as the scaling of the conductance on system parameters.
These results furnish a new example of the richness of open, driven, many--body
systems.

Electrical and thermal transport were studied in a vacuum-annealed
polycrystalline silver wire with residual resistivity ratio 200-400, in the
temperature range 0.1-1.2K and in magnetic fields up to 5T. Both at zero field
and at 5T the wire exhibits the Wiedemann-Franz law with the fundamental Lorenz
number, contrary to an earlier report [Gloos, K. et al, Cryogenics 30, 14
(1990)]. Our result demonstrates that silver is an excellent material for
thermal links in ultra-low-temperature experiments operating at high magnetic
fields.

Tensor networks capture large classes of ground states of phases of quantum
matter faithfully and efficiently. Their manipulation and contraction has
remained a challenge over the years, however. For most of the history, ground
state simulations of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems using (infinite)
projected entangled pair states have relied on what is called a time-evolving
block decimation. In recent years, multiple proposals for the variational
optimization of the quantum state have been put forward, overcoming accuracy
and convergence problems of previously known methods. The incorporation of
automatic differentiation in tensor networks algorithms has ultimately enabled
a new, flexible way for variational simulation of ground states and excited
states. In this work, we review the state of the art of the variational iPEPS
framework. We present and explain the functioning of an efficient,
comprehensive and general tensor network library for the simulation of infinite
two-dimensional systems using iPEPS, with support for flexible unit cells and
different lattice geometries.

A framework for studying the behavior of a classically frustrated signed
network in the process of random rewiring is developed. We describe jump
probabilities for change in frustration and formulate a theoretical estimate in
terms of the master equation. Stationary thermodynamic distribution and moments
are derived from the master equation and compared to numerical simulations.
Furthermore, an exact solution of the probability distribution is provided
through suitable mapping of rewiring dynamic to birth and death processes with
quadratic asymptotically symmetric transition rates.

<h3>Vacancy Tuned Magnetism in LaMn$_x$Sb$_2$</h3>

The layered ATMPn$_2$ (A = alkali earth or rare earth atom, TM = transition
metal, Pn = Sb, Bi) compounds are widely studied for their rich magnetism and
electronic structure topology. Here, we characterize the physical properties of
LaMn$_x$Sb$_2$, an understudied member of the ATMPn$_2$ family. LaMn$_x$Sb$_2$
forms with intrinsic Mn vacancies, and we demonstrate synthetic control of the
Mn occupancy to produce single crystals with x = 0.74-0.97. Magnetization and
transport measurements indicate LaMn$_x$Sb$_2$ has a rich
temperature-composition (T-x) magnetic phase diagram with physical properties
strongly influenced by the Mn occupancy. LaMn$_x$Sb$_2$ orders
antiferromagnetically at T$_{1}$ = 130--180 K, where T$_{1}$ increases with x.
Below T$_{1}$, the T-x phase diagram is complicated. At high x, there is a
second transition T$_2$ that decreases in temperature as x is lowered,
vanishing below x $\leq$ 0.85. A third, first-order, transition T$_3$ is
detected at x $\approx$ 0.92, and the transition temperature increases as x is
lowered, crossing above T$_2$ near x $\approx$ 0.9. On moving below x $<$ 0.79,
we find the crystal structure changes from the P4/nmm arrangement to a
I$\bar{4}$2m structure with partially ordered Mn vacancies. The change in
crystal structure results in the appearance of two new low temperature phases
and a crossover between regimes of negative and positive magnetoresistance.
Finally, we provide neutron diffraction for x = 0.93, and find that the high x
compositions first adopt a G-type AFM structure with the Mn moments aligned
within the ab-plane which is followed on cooling by a second transition to a
different, non-collinear structure where the moments are rotated within the
basal plane. Our results demonstrate that LaMn$_x$Sb$_2$ is a highly tunable
material with six unique magnetically ordered phases, depending on T and x.

The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how most isolated
many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, the hypothesis is
violated by phenomena such as many-body localization and quantum many-body
scars. In this work, we study a finite, two-dimensional, disordered model
hosting a tower of scar states. This construction is a particular instance of a
general framework and we demonstrate its generality by constructing two
disordered models hosting a different tower of scar states. At weak disorder,
we find numerically that the spectra are nonthermal, and the scar states appear
as exact eigenstates with high entropy for certain bipartitions. At strong
disorder, the spectra localize and the scar states are identified as inverted
scars since the scar states are embedded in a localized background as opposed
to a thermal background. We argue that, for the considered type of models, the
localization is stronger than what would be naively expected, and we show this
explicitly for one of the models. The argument also provides guidelines for
obtaining similarly strong localization in other scarred models. We study the
transition from the thermal phase to localization by observing the adjacent gap
ratio shifting from the Wigner surmise to the Poisson distribution with
increasing disorder strength. Moreover, the entanglement entropy transitions
from volume-law scaling with system size at weak disorder to area-law scaling
at strong disorder. Finally, we demonstrate that localization protects scar
revivals for initial states with partial support in the scar subspace.

<h3>Magnetic analogue of liquid-gas phase transition of water: case study of  a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on a diamond-decorated square lattice</h3>

<br>
The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on a diamond-decorated square lattice
exhibits an intriguing temperature-driven phase transition in a magnetic field
between a classical ferrimagnetic phase and a quantum monomer-dimer phase. A
generalized decoration-iteration transformation accurately maps the considered
model to an effective spin-1/2 Ising model on a square lattice with
temperature-dependent effective interactions and field, whereby the effective
field vanishes at the phase boundary separating the classical ferrimagnetic
phase from the quantum monomer-dimer phase. Typical features of the
magnetization, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat in the vicinity of
discontinuous and continuous thermal phase transitions between the classical
ferrimagnetic phase and the quantum monomer-dimer phase are elucidated.

Single crystals of In-doped PbBi2Te4 are synthesized via a conventional
solid-state method. Chemical analysis and hall measurements indicate that In
replaces Pb, introducing n-type carriers, creating Pb1-xInxBi2Te4. A
superconducting transition is observed with a maximum transition temperature
around 2.06 K for Pb1-xInxBi2Te4. Field dependent transport measurements reveal
type-II superconductivity and yield a maximum upper critical field around 1.55
T. Thermodynamic data indicates bulk superconductivity in the BCS weak coupling
limit. Our findings establish an ambient-pressure superconducting system in the
AM2X4 family, and doped PbBi2Te4 as a promising platform for the study of
topological superconductivity.

<h3>Absence of SO(4) quantum criticality in Dirac semimetals at two-loop  order</h3>

Evidence for relativistic quantum criticality of antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity in two-dimensional Dirac fermion systems has been found in
large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. However, the corresponding
($2+1$)-dimensional Gross--Neveu--Yukawa field theory with $N_f=2$
four-component Dirac fermions coupled to two triplets of order parameters does
not exhibit a renormalization group fixed point at one-loop order. Instead, the
theory only features a critical point for a large or very small fractional
number of fermion flavors $N_f$, which disappears for a broad range of flavor
numbers around the physical case, $N_f=2$, due to fixed-point annihilation.
This raises the question on how to explain the observed scaling collapse in the
quantum Monte Carlo data. Here, we extend previous renormalization-group
analyses by studying a generalized model at two-loop order in $4-\epsilon$
spacetime dimensions. We determine the $\epsilon$ correction to the upper and
lower critical flavor numbers for the fixed-point annihilation and find that
they both go towards the physical case $N_f=2$. However, this only happens very
slowly, such that an extrapolation to $\epsilon=1$ still suggests the absence
of criticality in $2+1$ dimensions. Thereby, we consolidate the finding that
the continuum field theory does not feature a stable renormalization-group
fixed point and no true quantum criticality would be expected for the
considered system. We briefly discuss a possible reconciliation in terms of a
complex conformal field theory. Further, we also explore the fixed-point
structure in an enlarged theory space and identify a candidate stable
fixed-point solution.

<h3>Self-induced Bose glass phase in quantum cluster quasicrystals</h3>

We study the emergence of Bose glass phases in self sustained bosonic
quasicrystals induced by a pair interaction between particles of
Lifshitz-Petrich type. By using a mean field variational method designed in
momentum space as well as Gross-Pitaevskii simulations we determine the phase
diagram of the model. The study of the local and global superfluid fraction
allows the identification of supersolid, super quasicrystal, Bose glass and
insulating phases. The Bose glass phase emerges as a quasicrystal phase in
which the global superfluidity is essentially zero, while the local
superfluidity remains finite in certain ring structures of the quasicrystalline
pattern. Furthermore, we perform continuous space Path Integral Monte Carlo
simulations for a case in which the interaction between particles stabilizes a
quasicrystal phase. Our results show that as the strength of the interaction
between particles is increased the system undergoes a sequence of states
consistent with the super quasicrystal, Bose glass, and quasicrystal insulator
thermodynamic phases.

Graphene nanoelectronics potential was limited by the lack of an intrinsic
bandgap[1] and attempts to tailor a bandgap either by quantum confinement or by
chemical functionalization failed to produce a semiconductor with a large
enough band gap and a sufficient mobility. It is well known that by evaporating
silicon from commercial electronics grade silicon carbide crystals an epitaxial
graphene layer forms on the surfaces [2]. The first epigraphene layer to form
on the silicon terminated face, known as the buffer layer, is insulating. It is
chemically bonded to the SiC and spectroscopic measurements [3] have identified
semiconducting signatures on the microscopic domains. However, the bonding to
the SiC is disordered and the mobilities are small. Here we demonstrate a
quasi-equilibrium annealing method that produces macroscopic atomically flat
terraces covered with a well ordered epigraphene buffer layer that has a 0.6 eV
bandgap. Room temperature mobilities exceed 5000 cm2/Vs which is much larger
than silicon and 20 times larger than the phonon scattering imposed limit of
current 2D semiconductors. Critical for nanotechnology, its lattice is aligned
with the SiC substrate, it is chemically, mechanically, and thermally robust,
and it can be conventionally patterned and seamlessly connected to semimetallic
epigraphene making semiconducting epigraphene ideally suited for
nanoelectronics.

Heterostructures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host
long-lived, tunable excitons, making them intriguing candidates for
material-based quantum information applications. Light absorption in these
systems induces a plethora of optically excited states that hybridize both
interlayer and intralayer characteristics, providing a distinctive starting
point for their relaxation processes, in which the interplay between generated
electron-hole pairs and their scattering with phonons play a key role. We
present a first-principles theoretical approach to compute phonon-induced
exciton decomposition due to rapid occupation of electron-hole pairs with
finite momentum and opposite spin. Using the MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure
as a case study, we observe a reduction in the optical activity of bright
states upon phonon scattering already in the first few femtoseconds proceeding
the photoexcitation, driving exciton interlayer delocalization and subsequent
variations in the exciton spin. Our results reveal an unexpected and previously
unexplored starting point for exciton relaxation dynamics, suggesting increased
availability for coherent interactions and non-radiative processes through
ultrafast changes in exciton momentum, spatial, and spin properties upon light
excitation.

The concept of topology has been widely applied to condensed matter, going
beyond the band crossover in reciprocal spaces. A recent breakthrough suggested
unconventional topological physics in a quadruple perovskite
TbMn$_3$Cr$_4$O$_{12}$, whose magnetism-induced polarization manifests a unique
Roman surface topology [Nat. Commun. \textbf{13}, 2373 (2022)]. However, the
available experimental evidence based on tiny polarizations of polycrystalline
samples is far from sufficient. Here, this topological multiferroicity is
demonstrated by using density functional theory calculations, which ideally
confirms the Roman surface trajectory of magnetism-induced polarization. In
addition, an alternative material in this category is proposed to
systematically enhance the performance, by promoting its magnetism-induced
polarization to an easily detectable level.

Solid-state spin qubits within silicon crystals at mK temperatures show great
promise in the realisation of a fully scalable quantum computation platform.
Qubit coherence times are limited in natural silicon owing to coupling to the
isotope ${ }^{29} \mathrm{Si}$ which has a non-zero nuclear spin. This work
presents a method for the depletion of ${ }^{29} \mathrm{Si}$ in localised
volumes of natural silicon wafers by irradiation using a 45 keV ${ }^{28}
\mathrm{Si}$ focused ion beam with fluences above $1 \times 10^{19} \,
\mathrm{ions} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry
analysis of the irradiated volumes shows unprecedented quality enriched silicon
that reaches a minimal residual ${ }^{29} \mathrm{Si}$ value of 2.3 $\pm$ 0.7
ppm and with residual C and O comparable to the background concentration in the
unimplanted wafer. Transmission electron microscopy lattice images confirm the
solid phase epitaxial re-crystallization of the as-implanted amorphous enriched
volume extending over 200 nm in depth upon annealing. The ease of fabrication,
requiring only commercially available natural silicon wafers and ion sources,
opens the possibility for co-integration of qubits in localised highly enriched
volumes with control circuitry in the surrounding natural silicon for
large-scale devices.

Superconductor Electronics (SCE) is a fast and power-efficient technology
with great potential for overcoming conventional CMOS electronics' scaling
limits. Nevertheless, the primary challenge confronting SCE today pertains to
its integration level, which lags several orders of magnitude behind CMOS
circuits. In this study, we have innovated and simulated a novel logic family
grounded in the principles of phase shifts occurring in 0 and $\pi$ Josephson
junctions. The fast phase logic (FPL) eliminates the need for large inductor
loops and shunt resistances by combining the half-flux and phase logic.
Therefore, the Josephson junction (JJ) area only limits the integration
density. The cells designed with this paradigm are fast, and the clock-to-Q
delay is about 4ps while maintaining over 50% parameter margins. This logic is
power efficient and can increase the integration by at least 100$\times$ in the
SCE chips.

<h3>Nonlinearity tunes crack dynamics in soft materials</h3>

<br>

Cracks in soft materials exhibit diverse dynamic patterns, involving
straight, oscillation, branching, and supershear fracture. Here, we
successfully reproduce these crack morphologies in a two-dimensional
pre-strained fracture scenario and establish crack stability phase diagrams for
three distinct nonlinear materials using a fracture phase field model. The
contrasting phase diagrams highlight the crucial role of nonlinearity in
regulating crack dynamics. In strain-softening materials, crack branching
prevails, limiting the cracks to sub-Rayleigh states. Yet strain-stiffening
stabilizes crack propagation, allowing for the presence of supershear fracture.
Of particular interest is the large-strain linear elastic materials, where
crack oscillation is readily triggered. The onset speed of such instability
scales linearly with the characteristic wave speed near the crack tip,
supporting the notion that such crack oscillations are a universal instability
closely tied to the wave speed. The oscillation wavelength is shown to be a
bilinear function of the nonlinear scale and crack driving force, with a
minimum length scale associated with the dissipative zone. Moreover, our
findings suggest that the increase in characteristic wave speed due to
strain-stiffening can account for the observed transition of cracks from
sub-Rayleigh to supershear regimes.

The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) of epitaxial BiFeO$_3$ thin films is
investigated. SMR consistent with ferromagnetic interfacial states for
BiFeO$_3$ films fabricated on (001) SrTiO$_3$ (R' BFO) and LaAlO$_3$ (T' BFO)
substrates is found, albeit with different temperature dependencies. For T'
BFO, the SMR is enhanced at room temperature, and decays with reduced
temperatures. By contrast, R' BFO shows a monotonic decrease in SMR response
with increasing temperature, mirroring the trend of a weak ferromagnet. Density
functional theory shows that this difference originates from the coupling of
the applied magnetic field to oxygen octahedral rotation (R') and spin (T')
degrees of freedom.

The topological phase in amorphous systems adds a new dimension to the
topological states of matter. Here, we present an interesting phenomenon dubbed
the topological Anderson amorphous insulator (TAAI). Anderson disorder can
drive topologically trivial amorphous systems with structural disorders into
noncrystalline topological insulators. The gap closing and reopening, spin Bott
index, robust edge states, and quantized conductance characterize the Anderson
disorder-induced nontrivial topology in amorphous systems. More importantly,
phase diagrams are given for the topological phase transition (TPT). It is
found that amorphous structural disorder and Anderson disorder are synergistic
to drive the s-p band inversion of the system and hence the TPT, which is
further confirmed by the effective medium theory. Our findings report a

The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) is a phenomenon which could produce a
transverse Hall voltage in a time-reversal-invariant material. Here, we report
the real space characterization of NLHE evaluated through quantum transport in
TaIrTe4 nanoribbon without the explicit Berry curvature dipole (BCD)
information. We first characterize the NLHE in both transverse confined
directions in global-level measurement. The impact of quantum confinement in
NLHE is evaluated by adjusting the width of nanoribbons. Then, the probing area
is trimmed to the atomic scale to evaluate the local texture, where we discover
its unique patterns among the probed atomic groups for the first time. The
analysis of charge distribution reveals the connections between NLHE's local
patterns and its non-centrosymmetric nature, rendering nearly an order of Hall
voltage enhancement through probe positioning. Our work paves the way to expand
the range of NLHE study and unveil its physics in more versatile material
systems.

Detecting spin-nematic states is challenging due to the absence of Bragg
peaks, but dynamical physical quantities offer promising means for
characterizing these states. In this study, we investigate the dynamical
properties of spin-nematic states in three-dimensional quantum spin systems in
a magnetic field. Using a two-component boson theory that incorporates magnons
and bi-magnons, we explore the dynamical quantities in the spin-nematic and
paramagnetic phases, with a particular focus on the dynamical spin structure
factor at zero temperature and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation
rate at finite temperatures. Our findings reveal that the dynamical structure
factor does not exhibit any diverging singularity across momentum and frequency
while providing a valuable information about the form factor of bi-magnon
states and the underlying structure of spin-nematic order. Additionally, we
find a temperature dependence in the NMR relaxation rate proportional to $T^3$
at low temperatures, similar to canted antiferromagnets. A clear distinction is
found as there is no critical divergence of the NMR relaxation rate at the
spin-nematic transition temperature. Our theory provides a comprehensive
understanding of the dynamical properties of spin-nematic states, covering
arbitrary spin values $S$ and encompassing site and bond nematic orders. We
also analyze these dynamical quantities using the same methodology in a canted
antiferromagnetic state. These are compared with the results in the
spin-nematic states.

<br>
Magnetic hysteresis has become a crucial aspect for characterizing
single-molecule magnets, but the comprehension of the coercivity mechanism is
still a challenge. By using analytical derivation and quantum dynamical
simulations, we reveal fundamental rules that govern magnetic relaxation of
single molecule magnets under the influence of external magnetic fields, which
in turn dictates the hysteresis behavior. Specifically, we find that energy
level crossing induced by magnetic fields can drastically increase the
relaxation rate and set a coercivity limit. The activation of
optical-phonon-mediated quantum tunneling accelerates the relaxation and
largely determines the coercivity. Intra-molecular exchange interaction in
multi-ion compounds may enhance the coercivity by suppressing key relaxation
processes. A single-occupant bond in mixed-valence complexes compromises
coercivity, and pre-spin-flip of the bonding electron facilitates the overall
magnetization reversal. Underlying these properties are magnetic relaxation
processes modulated by the interplay of magnetic fields, phonon spectrum and
spin state configuration, which also proposes a fresh perspective for the
nearly centurial coercive paradox.

<h3>Unveiling Hidden Physics in the 215-Kelvin Superconducting Calcium  Hydride: Temperature, Quantum and Defect Effects</h3>

<br>
<br>
Temperature and quantum effects induce the structural complexity of condensed
hydrogen, and therefore they are expected to impact nontrivially the structures
of clathrate hydrides. Exemplified by clathrate calcium hydride, we show
through ab initio (path-integral) molecular dynamics simulations that these
effects are indeed pivotal at 100-200 GPa. The quantum equation of states
derived at 300 K suggests that the synthesized samples in previous experiments
were berthollide-like CaH$_{6-\delta}$, with the stoichiometric defect $\delta$
increasing smoothly during decompression. The change of composition provides an
explanation for the experimental observation of positive pressure dependence of
superconducting T$_c$ below 165 GPa. Furthermore, we find significant proton
diffusion in CaH$_{6-\delta}$ at 150-300 K, with the diffusion coefficient
reaching 10$^{-7}$ cm$^{2}$/s. This suggests a coexistence of superconductivity
and proton diffusion in clathrate hydrides. Our findings underline the
importance of temperature, quantum and defect effects to the understandings of
the structure and pertinent physics in high-T$_c$ superconducting clathrate
hydrides.

<h3>Modeling for heterogeneous oxidative aging of polymers using  coarse-grained molecular dynamics</h3>

This study presents a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation model to
investigate the process of oxidative aging in polymers. The chemical aging
effect is attributed to the auto-oxidation mechanism, which is initiated by
radicals, leading to the chain scission and crosslinking of polymer chains. In
this study, we integrate a thermal oxidation kinetic model in the oxygen excess
regime into the Kremer-Grest model, thereby enabling a reactive coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulation to capture the process of oxidative degradation.
Our simulation reveals that when the timescale of the characteristic reaction
step of oxidative degradation is shorter than the longest relaxation time of
polymer chains, the scission sites exhibit spatial heterogeneity. This
innovative simulation model possesses the potential to enhance our
comprehension of polymer aging phenomena, thus making noteworthy contributions
to the realm of polymer science and degradation chemistry.

<h3>Steady vs. Dynamic Contributions of Different Doped Conducting Polymers  in the Principal Components of an Electronic Nose's Response</h3>

<br>
<br>
Multivariate data analysis and machine-learning classification become popular
tools to extract features without physical models for complex environments
recognition. For electronic noses, time sampling over multiple sensors must be
a fair compromise between a period sufficiently long to output a meaningful
information pattern, and sufficiently short to minimize training time for
practical applications. Particularly when reactivity's kinetics differ from
thermodynamics' in sensitive materials, finding the best compromise to get the
most from data is not obvious. Here, we investigate on the influence of data
acquisition to improve or alter data clustering for molecular recognition on a
conducting polymer electronic nose. We found out that waiting for the sensors
to reach their steady state is not required for classification, and that
reducing data acquisition down to the first dynamical information suffice to
recognize molecular gases by principal component analysis with the same
materials. Particularly for online inference, this study shows that a good
sensing array is no array of good sensors, and that new figure-of-merits shall
be defined for sensing hardware aiming machine-learning pattern-recognition
rather than metrology.

<br>
<br>
In a full-scale quantum computer with a fault-tolerant architecture, having
scalable, long-range interaction between qubits is expected to be a highly
valuable resource. One promising method of achieving this is through the
light-matter interaction between spins in semiconductors and photons in
superconducting cavities. This paper examines the theory of both transverse and
longitudinal spin-photon coupling and their applications in the silicon
metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) platform. We propose a method of coupling
which uses the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction arising from orbital
degeneracies in SiMOS qubits. Using theoretical analysis and experimental data,
we show that the strong coupling regime is achievable in the transverse scheme.
We also evaluate the feasibility of a longitudinal coupling driven by an AC
modulation on the qubit. These coupling methods eschew the requirement for an
external micromagnet, enhancing prospects for scalability and integration into
a large-scale quantum computer.

High magnetic fields up to 105 T have been utilized in deriving the upper
critical field $B_{\rm c2}$ of LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_x$ throughout whole
temperatures below $T_{\rm c}$. Resistivity measurements demonstrate that
$B_{\rm c2}$ behaves differently in samples with $x = 0.12$ (SC1) from those
with 0.32 (SC2). In SC1, the two-band model assuming the $s$-wave pairing gives
a good fitting with repulsive intraband interaction and dominant interband
coupling. In SC2, we have to assume attractive intraband interaction with weak
interband coupling, which in fact suggests a non-$s$-wave pairing in view of
the strong Coulomb repulsion. These results support the possibility that SC1
and SC2 have different pairing symmetries.

<h3>Inverse problem in the conditioning of Markov processes on trajectory  observables : what canonical conditionings can connect two given Markov  generators ?</h3>

<br>
<i>Cecile Monthus</i>
<br>
<br>
In the field of large deviations for stochastic dynamics, the canonical
conditioning of a given Markov process with respect to a given time-local
trajectory observable over a large time-window has attracted a lot of interest
recently. In the present paper, we analyze the following inverse problem: when
two Markov generators are given, is it possible to connect them via some
canonical conditioning and to construct the corresponding time-local trajectory
observable? We focus on continuous-time Markov processes and obtain the
following necessary and sufficient conditions: (i) for continuous-time Markov
jump processes, the two generators should involve the same possible elementary
jumps in configuration space, i.e. only the values of the corresponding rates
can differ; (ii) for diffusion processes, the two Fokker-Planck generators
should involve the same diffusion coefficients, i.e. only the two forces can
differ. In both settings, we then construct explicitly the various time-local
trajectory observables that can be used to connect the two given generators via
canonical conditioning. This general framework is illustrated with various
applications involving a single particle or many-body spin models. In
particular, we describe several examples to show how non-equilibrium Markov
processes with non-vanishing steady currents can be interpreted as the
canonical conditionings of detailed-balance processes with respect to explicit
time-local trajectory observables.

<br>
In$_2$O$_3$-based catalysts have shown high activity and selectivity for
CO$_2$ hydrogenation to methanol, however the origin of the high performance of
In$_2$O$_3$ is still unclear. To elucidate the initial steps of CO$_2$
hydrogenation over In$_2$O$_3$, we have combined X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to study
the adsorption of CO$_2$ on the In$_2$O$_3$(111) crystalline surface with
different terminations, namely the stoichiometric, the reduced, and the
hydroxylated surface, respectively. The combined approach confirms that the
reduction of the surface results in the formation of In ad-atoms and that water
dissociates on the surface at room temperature. A comparison of the
experimental spectra and the computed core-level-shifts (using methanol and
formic acid as benchmark molecules) suggests that CO$_2$ adsorbs as a carbonate
on all surface terminations. We find that CO$_2$ adsorption is hindered by
hydroxyl groups on the hydroxylated surface.

<h3>Effect of magnetic field on the long-time dynamics of two charged  coupled harmonic oscillators in the presence of a common heat bath</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper, the moderately long-time behaviours of the position
autocorrelation, position velocity correlation and velocity autocorrelation
functions for two charged coupled harmonic oscillators connected to a heat bath
are derived in the presence of a magnetic field via the Quantum Langevin
equation. It is seen that at long times the correlation functions at T->0
exhibit a power law decay with the coefficients of the power laws being
completely different for the two masses that affect the overall trends of the
decays of the correlation functions. The effect of the bath-induced force on
mass m1 mediated by the interaction of m2 with the common heat bath is studied
and the results are highlighted in the presence of an external magnetic field.
This brings out the distinctness of the coupled oscillator scenario from the
independent single oscillator model studied earlier in the literature. The
results in the absence of a magnetic field are also presented, which are
extremely important for analyzing the dynamics of atoms in protein molecules at
low temperatures.

<br>
<br>
We present the magnetic and structural properties of
[Cu(pyrazine)$_{0.5}$(glycine)]ClO$_4$ under applied pressure. As previously
reported, at ambient pressure this material consists of quasi-two-dimensional
layers of weakly coupled antiferromagnetic dimers which undergo Bose-Einstein
condensation of triplet excitations between two magnetic field-induced quantum
critical points (QCPs). The molecular building blocks from which the compound
is constructed give rise to exchange strengths that are considerably lower than
those found in other $S = 1/2$ dimer materials, which allows us to determine
the pressure evolution of the entire field-temperature magnetic phase diagram
using radio-frequency magnetometry. We find that a distinct phase emerges above
the upper field-induced transition at elevated pressures and also show that an
additional QCP is induced at zero-field at a critical pressure of $p_{\rm c} =
15.7(5)$ kbar. Pressure-dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction and density
functional theory calculations indicate that this QCP arises primarily from a
dimensional crossover driven by an increase in the interdimer interactions
between the planes. While the effect of quantum fluctuations on the lower
field-induced transition is enhanced with applied pressure, quantum Monte Carlo
calculations suggest that this alone cannot explain an unconventional asymmetry
that develops in the phase diagram.

We put forth a theoretical framework for engineering a two-dimensional (2D)
second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) by utilizing a heterostructure:
incorporating noncollinear magnetic textures between an s-wave superconductor
and a 2D quantum spin Hall insulator. It stabilizes the higher order
topological superconducting phase, resulting in Majorana corner modes (MCMs) at
four corners of a 2D domain. The calculated non-zero quadrupole moment
characterizes the bulk topology. Subsequently, through a unitary
transformation, an effective low-energy Hamiltonian reveals the effects of
magnetic textures, resulting in an effective in-plane Zeeman field and
spin-orbit coupling. This approach provides a qualitative depiction of the
topological phase, substantiated by numerical validation within exact
real-space model. Analytically calculated effective pairings in the bulk
illuminate the microscopic behavior of the SOTSC. The comprehension of MCM
emergence is aided by a low-energy edge theory, which is attributed to the
interplay between effective pairings of (px + py )-type and (px + ipy )-type.
Our extensive study paves the way for practically attaining the SOTSC phase by
integrating noncollinear magnetic textures.

Effectively tuning magnetic state by using current is essential for novel
spintronic devices. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have shown superior
properties for the applications of magnetic information storage based on the
efficient spin torque effect. However, for most of known vdW ferromagnets, the
ferromagnetic transition temperatures lower than room temperature strongly
impede their applications and the room-temperature vdW spintronic device with
low energy consumption is still a long-sought goal. Here, we realize the highly
efficient room-temperature nonvolatile magnetic switching by current in a
single-material device based on vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. Moreover, the
switching current density and power dissipation are about 300 and 60000 times
smaller than conventional spin-orbit-torque devices of magnet/heavymetal
heterostructures. These findings make an important progress on the applications
of magnetic vdW materials in the fields of spintronics and magnetic information
storage.

Machine Learning facilitates building a large variety of models, starting
from elementary linear regression models to very complex neural networks.
Neural networks are currently limited by the size of data provided and the huge
computational cost of training a model. This is especially problematic when
dealing with a large set of features without much prior knowledge of how good
or bad each individual feature is. We try tackling the problem using
dimensionality reduction algorithms to construct more meaningful features. We
also compare the accuracy and training times of raw data and data transformed
after dimensionality reduction to deduce a sufficient number of dimensions
without sacrificing accuracy. The indicated estimation is done using a lighter
decision tree-based algorithm, AdaBoost, as it trains faster than neural
networks. We have chosen the data from an online database of topological
materials, Materiae. Our final goal is to construct a model to predict the
topological properties of new materials from elementary properties.

<br>
We report a comprehensive study of polarized infrared/terahertz photocurrents
in bulk tellurium crystals. We observe different photocurrent contributions and
show that, depending on the experimental conditions, they are caused by the
trigonal photogalvanic effect, the transverse linear photon drag effect, and
the magnetic field induced linear and circular photogalvanic effects. All
observed photocurrents have not been reported before and are well explained by
the developed phenomenological and microscopic theory. We show that the effects
can be unambiguously distinguished by studying the polarization, magnetic
field, and radiation frequency dependence of the photocurrent. At frequencies
around 30 THz, the photocurrents are shown to be caused by the direct optical
transitions between subbands in the valence band. At lower frequencies of 1 to
3 THz, used in our experiment, these transitions become impossible and the
detected photocurrents are caused by the indirect optical transitions
(Drude-like radiation absorption).

<br>
<br>
In a previous study, we proposed a possibility of high $T_c$
superconductivity in mixed-anion nickelates with $d^{8+\delta}$ electron
configuration. The theory was based on the fact that the two-orbital Hubbard
model, when all the intra- and interorbital interactions have the same
magnitude, is equivalent to the bilayer Hubbard model, which has been suggested
to exhibit high $T_c$ superconductivity. The energy level offset $\Delta E$ in
the two-orbital model is transformed to twice the interlayer hopping in the
bilayer model, and hence appropriately large $\Delta E$ is favorable for
superconductivity in the former. Extending this idea to multiorbital systems,
we previously suggested materials with large energy level offset between
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $d$ orbitals, such as Ca$_2$NiO$_2$Cl$_2$, to be good
candidates for high $T_c$ superconductivity, but such materials have not been
synthesized to our knowledge. In the present study, we first focus on
Sr$_2$NiO$_2$Cl$_2$, which has been synthesized in the past but has small
$\Delta E$, and study the effect of applying pressure, which enhances $\Delta
E$. We also study a 4d analogue of Sr$_2$NiO$_2$Cl$_2$, namely,
Sr$_2$PdO$_2$X$_2$ ($X=$ Cl, F, H) , in which $\Delta E$ turns out to be large.
The analysis using fluctuation exchange approximation suggests possibility of
superconductivity in these systems with large $\Delta E$. We also study the
effect of electron doping of these material, which is expected to enhance
superconductivity, within the virtual crystal approximation.

<br>
Itinerant ferromagnetism at room temperature is a key ingredient for spin
transport and manipulation. Here, we report the realization of
nearly-room-temperature itinerant ferromagnetism in Co doped Fe5GeTe2 thin
flakes. The ferromagnetic transition temperature TC (323 K - 337 K) is almost
unchanged when thickness is down to 12 nm and is still about 284 K at 2 nm
(bilayer thickness). Theoretical calculations further indicate that the
ferromagnetism persists in monolayer Fe4CoGeTe2. In addition to the robust
ferromagnetism down to the ultrathin limit, Fe4CoGeTe2 exhibits an unusual
temperature- and thickness-dependent intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. We
propose that it could be ascribed to the dependence of band structure on
thickness that changes the Berry curvature near the Fermi energy level subtly.
The nearly-room-temperature ferromagnetism and tunable anomalous Hall effect in
atomically thin Fe4CoGeTe2 provide opportunities to understand the exotic
transport properties of two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials and
explore their potential applications in spintronics.

We present experimental and computational findings of the laser-induced

switching in garnets. We found distinct coherent magnetization precession
trajectories and switching times between four magnetization states, depending
on both directions of the light linear polarization and initial magnetic state.
As a fingerprint of the topological symmetry, the choice of the switching
trajectory is governed by an interplay of the photo-magnetic torque and
magnetic anisotropy. Our results open a plethora of possibilities for designing
energy-efficient magnetization switching routes at arbitrary energy landscapes.

We report local time-resolved thermometry in a silicon nanowire quantum dot
device designed to host a linear array of spin qubits. Using two alternative
measurement schemes based on rf reflectometry, we are able to probe either
local electron or phonon temperatures with $\mu$s-scale time resolution and a
noise equivalent temperature of $3$ $\rm mK/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$. Following the
application of short microwave pulses, causing local periodic heating,
time-dependent thermometry can track the dynamics of thermal excitation and
relaxation, revealing clearly different characteristic time scales. This work
opens important prospects to investigate the out-of-equilibrium thermal

Monolayer PbSe has been predicted to be a two-dimensional (2D) topological
crystalline insulator (TCI) with crystalline symmetry-protected Dirac-cone-like
edge states. Recently, few-layered epitaxial PbSe has been grown on the SrTiO3
substrate successfully, but the corresponding signature of the TCI was only
observed for films not thinner than seven monolayers, largely due to
interfacial strain. Here, we demonstrate a two-step method based on molecular
beam epitaxy for the growth of the PbSe-CuSe lateral heterostructure on the
Cu(111) substrate, in which we observe a nanopore patterned CuSe layer that
acts as the template for lateral epitaxial growth of PbSe. This further results
in a monolayer PbSe-CuSe lateral heterostructure with an atomically sharp
interface. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal a
four-fold symmetric square lattice of such monolayer PbSe with a quasi-particle
band gap of 1.8 eV, a value highly comparable with the theoretical value of
freestanding PbSe. The weak monolayer-substrate interaction is further
supported by both density functional theory (DFT) and projected crystal orbital
Hamilton population, with the former predicting the monolayer's anti-bond state
to reside below the Fermi level. Our work demonstrates a practical strategy to
fabricate a high-quality in-plane heterostructure, involving a monolayer TCI,
which is viable for further exploration of the topology-derived quantum physics
and phenomena in the monolayer limit.

Synchronization of two replicas of coupled map lattices for continuous maps
is known to be in the multiplicative noise universality class. We study this
transition in presence of identical quenched disorder in coupling in both
replicas for coupled logistic and tent maps. We study one-dimensional,
two-dimensional, and globally coupled cases. We observe a clear second-order
transition with new exponents. The order parameter decays as $t^{-\delta}$ with
$\delta=2$ for tent map and $\delta=3$ for logistic map in any dimension. The
asymptotic order parameter grows as $\Delta^{\beta}$ with $\beta=2$ for the
tent map and $\beta=3$ for the logistic map. The quenched disorder in coupling
is a relevant perturbation for the replica synchronization of coupled map
lattices. The critical exponents are different from that of the multiplicative
noise universality class. We observe that the critical exponents are
independent of dimensions and super-universal in nature.

A new variant of the superconducting fulleride $\mathrm{Rb_{3}C_{60}}$ is
presented, with $\mathrm{^{3}He}$ atoms encapsulated in the $\mathrm{C_{60}}$
cages. The $\mathrm{^{3}He}$ nuclei act as sensitive NMR probes embedded in the
material. The superconducting and normal states are characterised by
$\mathrm{^{3}He}$ NMR. Evidence is found for co-existing vortex liquid and
vortex solid phases below the superconducting transition temperature. A strong
dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time constant on spectral frequency
is observed in the superconducting state, as revealed by two-dimensional NMR
utilising an inverse Laplace transform. Surprisingly, this phenomenon persists,
in attenuated form, at temperatures well above the superconducting transition.

<h3>Equality of coefficients in Lanczos and Mori schemes for the computation  of autocorrelation functions and general estimate of corresponding  equilibration time scales</h3>

Among the various schemes to compute autocorrelation functions in quantum
mechanics are the Lanczos or iteration method and the Mori formalism. We show
that the coefficients (parameters) which appear in the respective schemes are
identical, and point out some other relations. We use the Lanczos method to
compute these coefficients from some respective observable and Hamiltonian. The
coefficients are endowed with a natural sequential order, computing them
iteratively becomes successively more involved. We use the Mori interpretation
to generate an estimate of the equilibration time of the autocorrelation
function from the low-order coefficients. Comparison with (state-of-the-art)
numerical data for the autocorrelation functions for some many-body examples
indicates that a few coefficients may suffice to determine the order of
magnitude of the equilibration time. This contributes to the field of
equilibration in closed quantum systems, where the determination of
equilibration time scales is both crucial and notoriously difficult.

Arrays of Rydberg atoms have appeared as a remarkably rich playground to
study quantum phase transitions in one dimension. One of the biggest puzzles
that was brought forward in this context is a commensurate-incommensurate phase
transitions out of density waves. Experiments report the transitions with
dynamical critical exponent $z>1$ that recent theoretical and numerical
analysis attribute to the appearance of chiral transitions introduced by Huse
and Fisher. However, further experimental exploration of these exotic
transitions is complicated by the narrow parameter window where chiral
transition can be realized. We argue that multi-component Rydberg arrays offer
extra experimentally controllable parameters and provide a mechanism to tune
quantum critical properties of the conformal Ashkin-Teller point that in turns
controls the extent of the chiral transition. Here we consider an effective
blockade model of two component Rydberg atoms - weak and strong components
obeying nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor blockades. When laser detuning is
applied to either strong or weak components the system is in the period-3 or
period-2 phases correspondingly. However, laser detuning used for both
components simultaneously stabilizes the period-4 phase partly surrounded by
the chiral transition. We show that the extent of the chiral transition and
even its appearance can be controlled by the relative ratio of the Rabi
frequencies of the two components.

<h3>Granular convergence as an iterated local map</h3>

Granular convergence is a property of a granular pack as it is repeatedly
sheared in a cyclic, quasistatic fashion, as the packing configuration changes
via discrete events. Under suitable conditions the set of microscopic
configurations encountered converges to a periodic sequence after sufficient
shear cycles. Prior work modeled this evolution as the iteration of a
pre-determined, random map from a set of discrete configurations into itself.
Iterating such a map from a random starting point leads to similar periodic
repetition. This work explores the effect of restricting the randomness of such
maps in order to account for the local nature of the discrete events. The
number of cycles needed for convergence shows similar statistical behavior to
that of numerical granular experiments. The number of cycles in a repeating
period behaves only qualitatively like these granular studies.

Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials have attracted intense research efforts
due to their promise for applications ranging from field-effect transistors and
low-power electronics to fault-tolerant quantum computation. One key challenge
is to fabricate 2D Dirac materials hosting Dirac electrons. Here, monolayer
germanene is successfully fabricated on a Ag2Ge surface alloy. Scanning
tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed a linear energy dispersion
relation. The latter was supported by density functional theory calculations.
These results demonstrate that monolayer germanene can be realistically
fabricated on a Ag2Ge surface alloy. The finding opens the door to exploration
and study of 2D Dirac material physics and device applications.

<h3>Mean field elastic moduli of a three-dimensional cell-based vertex model</h3>

The mechanics of a foam typically depends on the bubble geometry, topology,
and the material at hand, be it metallic or polymeric, for example. While the
foam energy functional for each bubble is typically minimization of surface
area for a given volume, biology provides us with a wealth of additional energy
functionals, should one consider biological cells as a foam-like material.
Here, we focus on a mean field approach to obtain the elastic moduli, within
linear response, for an ordered, three-dimensional vertex model using the
space-filling shape of a truncated octahedron and whose energy functional is
characterized by a restoring surface area spring and a restoring volume spring.
The tuning of the three-dimensional shape index exhibits a rigidity transition
via a compatible-incompatible transition. Specifically, for smaller shape
indices, both the target surface area and volume cannot be achieved, while
beyond some critical value of the three-dimensional shape index, they can be,
resulting in a zero-energy state. As the elastic moduli depend on curvatures of
the energy when the system, we obtain these as well. In addition to
analytically determining the location of the transition in mean field, we find
that the rigidity transition and the elastic moduli depend on the
parameterization of the cell shape with this effect being more pronounced in
three dimensions given the array of shapes that a polyhedron can take on (as
compared to a polygon). We also uncover nontrivial dependence on the
deformation protocol in which some deformations result in affine motion of the
vertices, while others result in nonaffine motion. Such dependencies on the
shape parameterization and deformation protocol give rise to a nontrivial shape
landscape and, therefore, nontrivial mechanical response even in the absence of
topology changes.

<h3>Electron trapping in graphene quantum dots with magnetic flux</h3>

It is known that the appearance of Klein tunneling in graphene makes it hard
to keep or localize electrons in a graphene-based quantum dot (GQD). However, a
magnetic field can be used to temporarily confine an electron that is traveling
into a GQD. The electronic states investigated here are resonances with a
finite trapping time, also referred to as quasi-bound states. By subjecting the
GDQ to a magnetic flux, we study the scattering phenomenon and the
Aharonov-Bohm effect on the lifetime of quasi-bound states existing in a GQD.
We demonstrate that the trapping time increases with the magnetic flux
sustaining the trapped states for a long time even after the flux is turned
off. Furthermore, we discover that the probability density within the GQD is
also clearly improved. We demonstrate that the trapping time of an electron
inside a GQD can be successfully extended by adjusting the magnetic flux
parameters.

<h3>Fragility of spectral flow for topological phases in non-Wigner-Dyson  classes</h3>

Topological insulators and superconductors support extended surface states
protected against the otherwise localizing effects of static disorder.
Specifically, in the Wigner-Dyson insulators belonging to the symmetry classes
A, AI, and AII, a band of extended surface states is continuously connected to
a likewise extended set of bulk states forming a ``bridge'' between different
surfaces via the mechanism of spectral flow. In this work we show that this
principle becomes \emph{fragile} in the majority of non-Wigner-Dyson
topological superconductors and chiral topological insulators. In these
systems, there is precisely one point with granted extended states, the center
of the band, $E=0$. Away from it, states are spatially localized, or can be
made so by the addition of spatially local potentials. Considering the
three-dimensional insulator in class AIII and winding number $\nu=1$ as a
paradigmatic case study, we discuss the physical principles behind this
phenomenon, and its methodological and applied consequences. In particular, we
show that low-energy Dirac approximations in the description of surface states
can be treacherous in that they tend to conceal the localizability phenomenon.
We also identify markers defined in terms of Berry curvature as measures for
the degree of state localization in lattice models, and back our analytical
predictions by extensive numerical simulations. A main conclusion of this work
is that the surface phenomenology of non-Wigner-Dyson topological insulators is
a lot richer than that of their Wigner-Dyson siblings, extreme limits being
spectrum wide quantum critical delocalization of all states vs. full
localization except at the $E=0$ critical point. As part of our study we
identify possible experimental signatures distinguishing between these
different alternatives in transport or tunnel spectroscopy.

<h3>Effect of shape asymmetry on percolation of aligned and overlapping  objects on lattices</h3>

We investigate the percolation transition of aligned, overlapping,
non-symmetrical shapes on lattices. Using the recently proposed lattice version
of excluded volume theory, we show that shape-asymmetry leads to some
intriguing consequences regarding the percolation behavior of asymmetric
shapes. We consider a prototypical asymmetric shape - rectangle - on a square
lattice and show that for rectangles of width unity (sticks), the percolation
threshold is a monotonically decreasing function of the stick length, whereas,
for rectangles of width greater than two, it is a monotonically increasing
function. Interestingly, for rectangles of width two, the percolation threshold
is independent of its length. The limiting case of the length of the rectangles
going to infinity shows that the limiting threshold value is finite and depends
upon the width of the rectangle. Unlike the case of symmetrical shapes like
squares, there seems to be no continuum percolation problem that corresponds to
this limit. We show that similar results hold for other asymmetric shapes and
lattices. The critical properties of the aligned and overlapping rectangles are
evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the threshold values
given by the lattice-excluded volume theory are in good agreement with the
simulation results, especially for larger rectangles. We verify the isotropy of
the percolation threshold and also compare our results with models where
rectangles of mixed orientation are allowed. Our simulation results show that
alignment increases the percolation threshold. The calculation of critical
exponents places the model in the standard percolation universality class. Our
results show that shape-anisotropy of the aligned, overlapping percolating
units has a marked influence on the percolation properties, especially when a
subset of the dimensions of the percolation units are made to diverge.

<h3>Excitons in twisted AA' hexagonal boron nitride bilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
The twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer has demonstrated
exceptional properties, particularly the existence of electronic flat bands
without needing a magic angle, suggesting strong excitonic effects. Therefore,
a systematic approach is presented to study the excitonic properties of twisted
AA' hBN using the Bethe-Salpeter equation based on single-particle
tight-binding wave functions. These are provided by a one-particle Hamiltonian
that is parameterized to describe the main features of {\it ab initio}
calculations. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is then solved in the so-called
excitonic transition representation, which significantly reduces the problem
dimensionality by exploiting the system's symmetries. Consequently, the
excitonic energies and the excitonic wave functions are obtained from the
direct diagonalization of the effective two-particle Hamiltonian of the
Bethe-Salpeter equation. We have studied rotation angles as low as
$7.34^{\circ}$. The model allows the study of commensurate and incommensurate
moir\'e patterns at much lower computational cost than the {\it ab initio}
version of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Here, using the model and effective
screening of the Keldysh type, we could obtain the absorption spectra and
characterize the excitonic properties of twisted hBN bilayers for different
rotation angles, demonstrating how this property affects the excitonic energies
and localizations of their wavefunctions.

<h3>Directly imaging spin polarons in a kinetically frustrated Hubbard  system</h3>

<br>
<br>
The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the
rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of
doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise
from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and
superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices,
itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been
theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite
their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic
observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin
polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms,
revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a
hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic
correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the
evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use
higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative
contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of
itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring
potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated
systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related
phenomena in triangular lattice moir\'{e} materials.
