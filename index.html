<h3>Collective motion in a sheet of microswimmers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05554" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05554</a>

Self-propelled micron-size particles suspended in a fluid, like bacteria or
synthetic microswimmers, are strongly non-equilibrium systems where particle
motility breaks the microscopic detailed balance, often resulting in
large-scale collective motion. Previous theoretical work has identified
long-range hydrodynamic interactions as the main driver of collective motion in
unbounded dilute suspension of rear-actuated ("pusher") microswimmers. In
contrast, most experimental studies of collective motion in microswimmer
suspensions have been carried out in quasi-2-dimensional geometries such as in
thin films or near solid or fluid interfaces, where both the swimmers' motion
and their long-range flow fields become altered due to the proximity of a
boundary. Here, we study numerically a minimal model of microswimmers in such a
restricted geometry, where the particles move in the midplane between two
no-slip walls. For pushers, we demonstrate collective motion with only
short-ranged order, in contrast with the long-ranged flows observed in
unbounded systems. For front-actuated ("puller") microswimmers, we discover a
long-wavelength density instability resulting in the formation of dense
microswimmer clusters. Both types of collective motion are fundamentally
different from their previously studied counterparts in unbounded domains. Our
results illustrate that hydrodynamic screening due to the presence of a wall is
subdominant in determining the collective state of the suspension, which is
instead dictated by the geometrical restriction of the swimmers' motion.

<h3>On-Command Disassembly of Microrobotic Superstructures for Transport and  Delivery of Magnetic Micromachines</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic microrobots have been developed for navigating microscale
environments by means of remote magnetic fields. However, limited propulsion
speeds at small scales remain an issue in the maneuverability of these devices
as magnetic force and torque are proportional to their magnetic volume. Here,
we propose a microrobotic superstructure, which, as analogous to a
supramolecular system, consists of two or more microrobotic units that are
interconnected and organized through a physical (transient) component (a
polymeric frame or a thread). Our superstructures consist of microfabricated
magnetic helical micromachines interlocked by a magnetic gelatin nanocomposite
containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). While the microhelices enable the
motion of the superstructure, the IONPs serve as heating transducers for
dissolving the gelatin chassis via magnetic hyperthermia. In a practical
demonstration, we showcase the superstructure's motion with a gradient magnetic
field in a large channel, the disassembly of the superstructure and release of
the helical micromachines by a high-frequency alternating magnetic field, and
the corkscrew locomotion of the released helices through a small channel via a
rotating magnetic field. This adaptable microrobotic superstructure reacts to
different magnetic inputs, which could be used to perform complex delivery
procedures within intricate regions of the human body.

<h3>The sine-Gordon model from coupled condensates: a Generalized  Hydrodynamics viewpoint</h3>

The sine-Gordon model captures the low-energy effective dynamics of a wealth
of one-dimensional quantum systems, stimulating the experimental efforts in
building a versatile quantum simulator of this field theory and fueling the
parallel development of new theoretical toolkits able to capture
far-from-equilibrium settings. In this work, we analyze the realization of
sine-Gordon from the interference pattern of two one-dimensional
quasicondensates: we argue the emergent field theory is well described by its
classical limit and develop its large-scale description based on Generalized
Hydrodynamics. We show how, despite sine-Gordon being an integrable field
theory, trap-induced inhomogeneities cause instabilities of excitations and
provide exact analytical results to capture this effect.

<h3>Observable signatures of Hall viscosity in lowest Landau level  superfluids</h3>

Hall viscosity is a non-dissipative viscosity occurring in systems with
broken time-reversal symmetry, such as quantum Hall phases and $p+ip$
superfluids. Despite Hall viscosity's expected ubiquity and past observations
in classical soft matter systems, it has yet to be measured experimentally in
any quantum phase of matter. Toward this end, we describe the observable
effects of Hall viscosity in a simple family of rotating Bose-Einstein
condensates of electrically neutral bosons, in which all of the bosons condense
into a single LLL orbital. Such phases are accessible to current cold atom
experiments, and we dub them lowest Landau level (LLL) superfluids. We
demonstrate that LLL superfluids possess a non-universal Hall viscosity,
leading to a range of observable consequences such as rotation of
vortex-antivortex dipoles and wave-vector dependent corrections to the speed of
sound. Furthermore, using a coherent state path integral approach, we present a
microscopic derivation of the Landau-Ginzburg equations of a LLL superfluid,
showing explicitly how Hall viscosity enters.

Mesonic bound states of domain walls can be stabilized in quasi
one-dimensional magnetic compounds. Here, we theoretically study the Raman
light scattering response of a twisted Kitaev chain with tilted magnetic fields
as a minimal model for confinement in $\text{CoNb}_{2}\text{O}_{6}$. By both
numerical matrix product states and few-domain wall variational states, we show
that confinement-induced bound states directly manifest themselves as sharp
peaks in the Raman response. Near quantum criticality the Raman spectrum
exhibit the famous E$_{8}$ symmetry. Remarkably, by tuning the polarization of
the incident light field, we demonstrate that the Raman response offers new
insights into the intrinsic structure of the bound state wavefunction.

Biomolecular condensates formed through the phase separation of proteins and
nucleic acids are widely observed, offering a fundamental means of organizing
intracellular materials in a membrane-less fashion. Traditionally, these
condensates have been regarded as homogeneous isotropic liquids. However, in
analogy with some synthetic copolymer systems, our recent theoretical research
has demonstrated that model biomolecular condensates can exhibit a
microemulsion-like internal structure, contingent upon the specific sequence,
inter-chain site-site interactions, and concentrated phase polymer density. In
this study, we present a microscopic dynamical theory for the self-diffusion
constant and viscosity of concentrated unentangled A/B regular multiblock
copolymer solutions. Our approach integrates static equilibrium local and
microdomain scale structural information obtained from PRISM integral equation
theory and the time evolution of the autocorrelation function of monomer scale
forces at the center-of-mass level that determine the polymer diffusion
constant and viscosity in a weak caging regime far from a glass or gel
transition. We focus on regular multi-block systems both for simplicity and for
its relevance to synthetic macromolecular science. The impact of sequence and
inter-chain attraction strength on the slowing down of copolymer mass transport
and flow due to local clustering enhanced collisional friction and retardation
of motion due to emergent microdomain scale ordering are established. Analytic
analysis and metrics employed in the study of biomolecular condensates are
employed to identify key order parameters that quantity how attractive forces,
packing structure, multiblock sequence, and copolymer density determine
dynamical slowing down above and below the crossover to a fluctuating polymeric
microemulsion state.

<h3>Effects of the measurement power on states discrimination and dynamics  in a circuit-QED experiment</h3>

<br>
<br>
We explore the effects of driving a cavity at a large photon number in a
circuit-QED experiment where the ``matter-like'' part corresponds to an unique
Andreev level in a superconducting weak link. The three many-body states of the
weak link, corresponding to the occupation of the Andreev level by 0, 1 or 2
quasiparticles, lead to different cavity frequency shifts. We show how the
non-linearity inherited by the cavity from its coupling to the weak link
affects the state discrimination and the photon number calibration. Both
effects require treating the evolution of the driven system beyond the
dispersive limit. In addition, we observe how transition rates between the
circuit states (quantum and parity jumps) are affected by the microwave power,
and compare the measurements with a theory accounting for the ``dressing'' of
the Andreev states by the cavity.

<br>
<br>
ComDMFT is a parallel computational package designed to study the electronic
structure of correlated quantum materials from first principles. Our approach
is based on the combination of first-principles methods and dynamical mean
field theories. In version 2.0, we implemented fully-diagrammatic GW+EDMFT from
first-principles. In this approach, correlated electrons are treated within
full GW+EDMFT and the rest are treated within full-GW, seamlessly. This
implementation enables the electronic structure calculation of quantum
materials with weak, intermediate, and strong electron correlation without
prior knowledge of the degree of electron correlation.

<h3>Giant Modulation of Refractive Index from Correlated Atomic-Scale  Disorder</h3>

<br>
Correlated disorder has been shown to enhance and modulate magnetic,
electrical, dipolar, electrochemical and mechanical properties of materials.
However, the possibility of obtaining novel optical and opto-electronic
properties from such correlated disorder remains an open question. Here, we
show unambiguous evidence of correlated disorder in the form of anisotropic,
sub-angstrom-scale atomic displacements modulating the refractive index tensor
and resulting in the giant optical anisotropy observed in BaTiS3, a
quasi-one-dimensional hexagonal chalcogenide. Single crystal X-ray diffraction
studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within
adjacent TiS6 chains along the c-axis, and three-fold degenerate Ti
displacements in the a-b plane. 47/49Ti solid-state NMR provides additional
evidence for those Ti displacements in the form of a three-horned NMR lineshape
resulting from low symmetry local environment around Ti atoms. We used scanning
transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the globally disordered Ti
a-b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally over a few unit
cells. First-principles calculations show that the Ti a-b plane displacements
selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab-plane, while having
minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus
resulting in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong
connection between correlated disorder and the optical response in BaTiS3, this
study opens a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive
index and functionalities such as a large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.

<h3>FluxGAN: A Physics-Aware Generative Adversarial Network Model for  Generating Microstructures That Maintain Target Heat Flux</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04622</a>
<br>
<i>Artem K. Pimachev, Manoj Settipalli, Sanghamitra Neogi</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a physics-aware generative adversarial network model, FluxGAN,
capable of simultaneously generating high-quality images of large
microstructures and description of their thermal properties. During the
training phase, the model learns about the relationship between the local
structural features and the physical processes, such as the heat flux in the
microstructures, due to external temperature gradients. Once trained, the model
generates new structural and associated heat flux environments, bypassing the
computationally expensive modeling. Our model provides a cost effective and
efficient approach over conventional modeling techniques, such as the finite
element method (FEM), for describing the thermal properties of microstructures.
The conventional approach requires computational modeling that scales with the
size of the microstructure model, therefore limiting the simulation to a given
size, resolution, and complexity of the model. In contrast, the FluxGAN model
uses synthesis-by-part approach and generates arbitrary large size images at
low computational cost. We demonstrate that the model can be utilized to
generate designs of thermal sprayed coatings that satisfies target thermal
properties. Furthermore, the model is capable of generating coating
microstructures and physical processes in three-dimensional (3D) domain after
being trained on two-dimensional (2D) examples. Our approach has the potential
to transform the design and optimization of thermal sprayed coatings for
various applications, including high-temperature and long-duration operation of
gas turbines for aircraft or ground-based power generators.

<br>
<br>
Employing flux-grown single crystal WSe$_2$, we report charge carrier
scattering behaviors measured in $h$-BN encapsulated monolayer field effect
transistors. We perform quantum transport measurements across various hole
densities and temperatures and observe an increase in transport mobility $\mu$
as a function of hole density in the degenerately doped sample. This unusual
behavior can be explained by energy dependent scattering amplitude of strong
defects calculated using the T-matrix approximation. Utilizing long mean-free
path ($>$500 nm), we demonstrate the high quality of our electronic devices by
showing quantized conductance steps from an electrostatically-defined quantum
point contact. Our results show the potential for creating ultra-high quality
quantum optoelectronic devices based on atomically thin semiconductors.

Acid-base equilibria directly influence the functionality and behavior of
particles in a system. Due to the ionizing effects of acid-base functional
groups, particles will undergo charge exchange. The degree of ionization and
their intermolecular and electrostatic interactions are controlled by varying
the pH and salt concentration of the solution in a system. Although the pH can
be tuned in experiments, it is hard to model this effect using simulations or
theoretical approaches. This is due to the difficulty in treating charge
regulation and capturing the cooperative effects in a colloidal suspension with
Coulombic interaction. In this work, we analyze a suspension of ionizable
colloidal particles via Brownian simulations and derive a phase diagram of the
system as a function of pH. It is observed that as pH increases, particles
functionalized with acid groups change their arrangement from face-centered
cubic (FCC) packing to a disordered state. We attribute these transitions to an
increase in the degree of charge polydispersity arising from an increase in pH.
Our work shows that charge regulation leads to amorphous solids in colloids
when the mean nanoparticle charge is sufficiently high.

<h3>An exact method for bosonizing the Fermi surface in arbitrary dimensions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Inspired by the recent work by Delacretaz et. al., we rigorously derive an
exact and simple method to bosonize a non-interacting fermionic system with a
Fermi surface starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian. In the long-wavelength
limit, we show that the derived bosonized action is exactly equivalent to the
action obtained by Delacretaz et. al. In addition, we propose diagrammatic
rules to evaluate correlation functions using our bosonized theory and
demonstrate these rules by calculating the three- and four-point density
correlation functions. We also consider a general density-density interaction
and show that the simplest approximation in our bosonic theory is identical to
RPA results.

<h3>Giant 2D Skyrmion Topological Hall Effect with Ultrawide Temperature  Window and Low-Current Manipulation in 2D Room-Temperature Ferromagnetic  Crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
The discovery and manipulation of topological Hall effect (THE), an abnormal
magnetoelectric response mostly related to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), are promising for next-generation spintronic devices based
on topological spin textures such as magnetic skyrmions. However, most
skyrmions and THE are stabilized in a narrow temperature window either below or
over room temperature with high critical current manipulation. It is still
elusive and challenging to achieve large THE with both wide temperature window
till room temperature and low critical current manipulation. Here, by using
controllable, naturally-oxidized, sub-20 and sub-10 nm 2D van der Waals
room-temperature ferromagnetic Fe3GaTe2-x crystals, robust 2D THE with
ultrawide temperature window ranging in three orders of magnitude from 2 to 300
K is reported, combining with giant THE of ~5.4 micro-ohm cm at 10 K and ~0.15
micro-ohm cm at 300 K which is 1-3 orders of magnitude larger than that of all
known room-temperature 2D skyrmion systems. Moreover, room-temperature
current-controlled THE is also realized with a low critical current density of
~6.2*10^5 A cm^-2. First-principles calculations unveil natural
oxidation-induced highly-enhanced 2D interfacial DMI reasonable for robust
giant THE. This work paves the way to room-temperature, electrically-controlled
2D THE-based practical spintronic devices.

Amphiphilic molecules spontaneously form self-assembly structures based on
physical conditions such as molecular structure, concentration, and
temperature. These structures exhibit various useful functions according to
their morphology. The concept of the critical packing parameter serves to
correlate self-organized structures with chemical composition. However, unless
both molecular arrangement and self-assembly patterns are understood, direct
computational utilization for molecular design remains challenging. In this
study, we attempt to predict the self-assembled structure of a molecule
directly from its chemical structure and analyze factors influencing it using
machine learning. Dissipative particle dynamics simulations were used to
reproduce many self-assembly structures composed of various chemical
structures, and their critical packing parameters were calculated. A machine
learning model was built using the chemical structures as input data and the
critical packing parameters as output data.As a result, both Random Forest and
a type of Recurrent Neural Network known as GRU demonstrated high predictive
accuracy. It has been revealed through feature importance analysis and
dependence on sample size that the amphiphilic nature of molecules
significantly influences the self-assembly structures. Additionally, the
importance of selecting an appropriate molecular structure representation for
each algorithm has been emphasized. The results of this research will help to
further streamline product development in the fields of materials science,
materials chemistry, and medical materials.

<h3>Ultrafast Carrier Relaxation and Second Harmonic Generation in a  Higher-Fold Weyl Fermionic System PtAl</h3>

<br>
<br>
In topological materials, shielding of bulk and surface states by crystalline
symmetries has provided hitherto unknown access to electronic states in
condensed matter physics. Interestingly, photo-excited carriers relax on an
ultrafast timescale, demonstrating large transient mobility that could be
harnessed for the development of ultrafast optoelectronic devices. In addition,
these devices are much more effective than topologically trivial systems
because topological states are resilient to the corresponding
symmetry-invariant perturbations. By using optical pump probe measurements, we
systematically describe the relaxation dynamics of a topologically nontrivial
chiral single crystal, PtAl. Based on the experimental data on transient
reflectivity and electronic structures, it has been found that the carrier
relaxation process involves both acoustic and optical phonons with oscillation
frequencies of 0.06 and 2.94 THz, respectively, in picosecond time scale. PtAl
with a space group of $P$$2_{1}$3 allows only one non-zero susceptibility
element i.e. $d_{14}$, in second harmonic generation (SHG) with a large value
of 468(1) pm/V, which is significantly higher than that observed in standard
GaAs(111) and ZnTe(110) crystals. The intensity dependence of the SHG signal in
PtAl reveals a non-perturbative origin. The present study on PtAl provides
deeper insight into topological states which will be useful for ultrafast
optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Metastable Patterns in one- and two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein  Condensates</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper we study metastable states in single- and two-component dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensates. We show that this system supports a rich spectrum of
symmetries that are remarkably stable despite not being ground states. In a
parameter region where striped phases are ground states, we find such
metastable states that are energetically favourable compared to triangular and
honeycomb lattices. Among these metastable states we report a peculiar
ring-lattice state, which is led by the competition between triangular and
honeycomb symmetries and rarely seen in other systems. In the case of dipolar
mixtures we show that via tuning the miscibility these states can be stabilized
in a broader domain by utilising inter-species interactions.

<h3>Incremental dynamics of prestressed viscoelastic solids and its  applications in shear wave elastography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04745</a>

<br>
<br>
Shear wave elastography (SWE) has emerged as a new imaging modality that
brings tissue mechanical properties as biomarkers potentially useful for early
and precise diagnosis. While different SWE methods have been proposed, how to
relate the frequency SWE measurements to quasi-static stiffnesses of tissues
sensed by cells when prestresses are involved remains challenging. Here we
suggest an incremental dynamics theory for prestressed viscoelastic solids and
investigate its application in SWE across a broad frequency range. To model the
power-law dispersion relation with minimal parameters, we introduce the
Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivation model (KVFD) in the constitutive modeling of
material viscoelasticity. To validate the usefulness of the theory, we
performed experiments on prestressed soft materials and biological tissues. The
results show that the theoretical solution fits the experimental dispersion
curve well over a broad frequency range and accurately captures the effect of
prestress. The theory also reveals the correlation of phase velocities and
attenuations of shear waves with principal stresses and leads to a method for
probing the prestress in a viscoelastic solid without prior knowledge of the
constitutive parameters as validated by our numerical experiments. Taken
together, our results show that the theory presented here enables the
development of spatially resolved SWE when high-frequency shear waves get
involved, and provides insights into wave motions in soft materials subject to
prestresses.

<br>
<br>
ScaleLat (Scale Lattice) is a computer program written in C for performing
the atomic structure analysis of multi-phase system or high entropy alloys
(HEAs). The program implements an atomic cluster extraction algorithm to obtain
all independent and symmetry-reduced characteristic chemical structures for the
complex atomic configurations which are usually obtained from molecular
dynamics or kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations for supercell containing more than
104 atoms. ScaleLat employes an efficient and unique chemical structure
matching algorithm to map all extracted atomic clusters from a large supercell
(>10^4 atoms) to a representative small one (~ 10^3 or less), providing the
possibility to directly use the highly accurate quantum mechanical methods to
study the electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of multi-component
alloys with complex microstructures. We demonstrate the capability of ScaleLat
code by conducting both the atomic structure analysis and chemical structure
matching procedure for Fe-12.8 at.% Cr binary alloy and equiatomic CrFeCoNiCu
high entropy alloy, and by successfully obtaining the representatively
supercells containing 10^2~10^3 atoms of the two alloys. Overall, ScaleLat
program provides a universal platform to efficiently project all essential
chemical structures of large complex atomic structures to a relatively
easy-handling small supercell for quantum mechanical calculations of various
user interested properties.

<h3>Inverse transitions and disappearance of the λ-line in the  asymmetric random field Ising and Blume-Capel models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04758" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04758</a>

<br>
<br>
We report on reentrance in the random field Ising and Blume-Capel models,
induced by an asymmetric bimodal random field distribution. The conventional
continuous line of transitions between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
phases, the {\lambda}-line, is wiped away by the asymmetry. The phase diagram,
then, consists of only first order transition lines that always end at ordered
critical points. We find that while for symmetric random field distributions
there was no reentrance, the asymmetry in the random field results in a range
of temperatures for which magnetisation shows reentrance. While this does not
give rise to an inverse transition in the Ising model, for the Blume-Capel
model, however, there is a line of first order inverse phase transitions that
ends at an inverse ordered critical point. We show that the location of the
inverse transitions can be inferred from the ground state phase diagram of the
model.

<h3>Orbital diffusion, polarization and swapping in centrosymmetric metals</h3>

<i>Aurélien Manchon, A. Pezo, Kyoung-Whan Kim, Kyung-Jin Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a general theory of charge, spin and orbital diffusion based on
Keldysh formalism. Our findings indicate that the diffusivity of orbital
angular momentum in metals is much lower than that of spin or charge due to the
strong orbital intermixing in crystals. Furthermore, our theory introduces the
concept of spin-orbit polarization by which a pure orbital (spin) current
induces a longitudinal spin (orbital) current, a process as efficient as spin
polarization in ferromagnets. Finally, we find that orbital currents undergo
momentum swapping, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. This theory
establishes several key parameters for orbital transport of direct importance
to experiments.

The spin element of the Onsager matrix for the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ critical
XXZ chain at infinite temperature and zero magnetic field is studied to
evaluate the spin diffusion. Its formula is written down by known functions
with the use of TBA equations for the integrable XXZ chain with arbitrary spin.
We treat the element of the Onsager matrix as a function of the anisotropy
parameter $\Delta=\cos\theta$ where $\frac{\theta}{\pi}$ is a rational number.
The element shows a popcorn dependence on the $\Delta$ in a way it is
discontinuous at every parametrized point. Moreover the element diverges at all
the discontinuous points.

Two-dimensional (2D) noncentrosymmetric systems offer potential opportunities
for exploiting the valley degrees of freedom for advanced information
processing, owing to non-zero Berry curvature. However, such valley
polarization in 2D materials is crucially governed by the intervalley excitonic
scattering in momentum space due to reduced electronic degrees of freedom and
consequent enhanced electronic correlation. Here, we study the valley excitonic
properties of two 2D noncentrosymmetric complementary structures, namely,
BC$_6$N and B$_3$C$_2$N$_3$ using first principles-based GW calculations
combined with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), that brings the many-body
interactions among the quasiparticles. The \textbf{k}-resolved oscillator
strength of their first bright exciton indicates their ability to exhibit
valley polarization under the irradiation of circularly polarized light of
different chiralities. Both the systems show significant singlet excitonic
binding energies of 0.74 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively. Higher stability of dark
triplet excitons as compared to the singlet one can lead to higher quantum
efficiency in both the systems. The combination of large excitonic binding
energies and the valley polarization ability with minimal intervalley
scattering make them promising candidates for applications in advanced optical
devices and information storage technologies.

Multi-functional manipulation of magnetic topological textures such as
skyrmions and bimerons in energy-efficient ways is of great importance for
spintronic applications, but still being a big challenge. Here, by
first-principles calculations and atomistic simulations, the creation and
annihilation of skyrmions/bimerons, as key operations for the reading and
writing of information in spintronic devices, are achieved in van der Waals
magnetoelectric CrISe/In2Se3 heterostructure via perpendicular strain or
electric field without external magnetic field. Besides, the bimeron-skyrmion
conversion, size modulation and the reversible magnetization switching from
in-plane to out-of-plane could also be realized in magnetic-field-free ways.
Moreover, the topological charge and morphology can be precisely controlled by
a small magnetic field. The strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and
tunable magnetic anisotropy energy in a wide window are found to play vital
roles in such energy efficient multi-functional manipulation, and the
underlying physical mechanisms are elucidated. Our work predicts the
CrISe/In2Se3 heterostructure being an ideal platform to address this challenge
in spintronic applications, and theoretically guides the low-dissipation
multi-functional manipulation of magnetic topological textures.

<br>
A plethora of correlated and exotic metallic states have been identified on
the border of itinerant magnetism, where the long-range spin texture is melted
by tuning the magnetic transition temperature (T$_C$) towards zero, referred to
as the quantum phase transition (QPT). So far, the study of QPT in itinerant
magnets has mainly focused on low-T$_C$ materials (i.e., typically T$_C$ ~ 10
K) where the modification of electronic band structure is subtle, and only
makes a small contribution to the QPT. Here we report a distinct example of a
magnetic QPT accompanied by a gigantic modification of the electronic structure
in FeGe, i.e., a well-studied itinerant chiral magnet hosting
near-room-temperature (T$_C$ = 278 K) helical/skyrmion spin texture. The
pressure-driven modification of the band structure (e.g., reduction of exchange
splitting) is evidenced by magneto-transport study, suggesting a Fermi-surface
reconstruction around the magnetic QPT (P ~19 GPa), in stark contrast to the
case of typical metallic ferromagnets. Further application of pressure leads to
a metal-to-insulator transition above P > 30 GPa, as also corroborated by our
density-functional theory (DFT) calculation. Of particular interest is the
occurrence of anomalous magneto-transport in the inhomogeneous short-range
chiral-spin ground state (P = 20-30 GPa) above the QPT, with longitudinal
fluctuations of magnetization. The unexpected observation of spontaneous
anomalous Hall effect in this exotic quantum regime suggests macroscopic
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking, even in the absence of long-range
magnetic order. Our findings mark the large body of unexplored high-T$_C$
itinerant magnets with broken inversion-symmetry as promising candidates of
novel ground state formation near QPT.

In recent years, non-Hermitian phases in classical and quantum systems have
garnered significant attention. In particular, their intriguing band geometry
offers a platform for exploring unique topological states and unconventional
quantum dynamics. However, their topological characterization becomes
particularly interesting and challenging in complex multiband systems. Here we
propose a decimation framework, which leverages real space renormalization
group to streamline the analysis of complex multiband non-Hermitian systems.
Our systematic approach allows us to probe different phases and transitions,
analyze bulk-boundary correspondence, formulate generalized Brillouin zones,
investigate open boundary spectra, survey non-Bloch van Hove singularities,
study disorder-induced effects, and explore tunable non-Hermitian flat band
physics. Additionally, our framework allows proposing a hypothesis about
quasi-one-dimensional bipartite non-Hermitian systems with flat bands,
demonstrating their decoupling into Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains and compact
localized states across various models. Our work presents a powerful and
comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate properties of
non-Hermitian multiband systems, offering insights into the evolving landscape
of non-Hermitian topological physics.

The non-equilibrium steady states emerging from stochastic resetting to a
distribution is studied. We show that for a range of processes, the
steady-state moments can be expressed as a linear combination of the moments of
the distribution of resetting positions. The coefficients of this series are
universal in the sense that they do not depend on the resetting distribution,
only underlying dynamics. We consider the case of a Brownian particle and a
run-and-tumble particle confined in a harmonic potential, where we derive
explicit closed-form expressions for all moments for any resetting
distribution. Numerical simulations are used to verify the results, showing
excellent agreement.

A combinatorial approach is employed to investigate the atomic and electronic
structures of a metal vacancy in titanium carbide. It turns out that the usual
relaxed geometry of the vacancy is just a metastable state representing a local
energy minimum. Using ab initio calculations and by systematically searching
through the configurational space of a Ti monovacancy, we identify a multitude
of local minima with reconstructed geometry that are lower in energy. Among
them, there is a planar configuration with two displaced carbons forming a
dimer inside the vacancy. This structure has the optimal number and order of
C-C bonds making it the global minimum. Further calculations show that this
reconstructed geometry is also the ground state of metal vacancies in other
carbides such as ZrC, HfC, and VC. The reconstructed metal vacancies are
characterized by localized electron states due to the relatively short C-C
bonds. The defect states lie just below the upper and lower valence bands. The
existence of reconstructed vacancy configurations is essential for
understanding the mechanism of metal self-diffusion in transition-metal
carbides.

To avoid the impact of inherent natural imperfections on experimental
outcomes during testing, a recently designed genuine triaxial apparatus has
enabled the replication of conditions where the three principal stresses
exhibit varying magnitudes. This setup facilitates the examination of fracture
behaviors in materials similar to the 4-series under genuine triaxial stress
states. The experimental findings revealed that the maximum strength
experiences significant influence from the minimum principal stress and the
intermediate principal stress in genuine triaxial stress conditions.
Specifically, for a fixed minimum principal stress ({\sigma}3), there is a
progressive reduction in peak strain as the intermediate principal stress
({\sigma}2) increases. Moreover, as the minimum principal stress ({\sigma}3)
rises, the magnitude of peak strain diminishes. The Young's modulus of the
specimens exhibits an exponential increase with the augmentation of confining
pressure, and it demonstrates a linear growth pattern as the intermediate
principal stress increases. Additionally, the cohesion force is observed to
rise while the internal friction angle decreases with the elevation of the
intermediate principal stress. The failure modes of the specimens in genuine
triaxial stress conditions can be categorized into three types, all of which
exhibit a specific angle between the fracture surface and {\sigma}3, ranging
from 50 to 62 degrees. Furthermore, a comparison between the computed range and
the actual measurement range of the fracture angle highlights several
limitations in the relationship between the fracture angle ({\theta}) and the
internal friction angle ({\phi}) within the Coulomb criterion, particularly in
rocks containing complex fracture systems.

Multiscale modelling is a new paradigm that has emerged in recent times to
study the well-known problem of the process-structure-property relationship in
the area of materials science and engineering. For obtaining the desired
performance for materials of strategic importance, such as superalloys, it is
essential to bridge different length and time scales in order to navigate the
entire design space. In the present study, we develop a physics-based model for
a Ni-based superalloy where the microstructures simulated using a phase-field
model serve as input to finite-element computations. We examine the alloy's
microstructure evolution and effective elastic properties quantitatively via
phase-field and finite element methods integrated with CALPHAD database, by
varying composition and aging temperature. The phase-field simulations provide
us with an insight into the different regimes of microstructure evolution. The
finite element analysis uncovers the relation of effective elastic properties
with several system parameters.

<h3>From shear bands to earthquakes in a model granular material with  contact aging</h3>

We perform molecular dynamics simulations of homogeneous athermal systems of
poly-disperse soft discs under shear. For purely repulsive interactions between
particles, and under a confining external pressure, a monotonous flow curve
(strain rate vs. stress) starting at a critical yield stress is obtained, with
deformation distributing uniformly in the system, on average. Then we add a
short range attractive contribution to the interaction potential that increases
its intensity as particles remain in contact for a progressively longer time,
mimicking an aging effect into the system. In this case the flow curve acquires
a reentrant behavior, namely, a region of negative slope. Within this region
the deformation is seen to localize in a shear band with a well defined width
that decreases as the global strain rate does. At very low strain rates the
shear band becomes very thin and deformation acquires a prominent stick-slip
behavior. This regime can be described as the system possessing a fault in
which deformation occurs with the phenomenology that characterizes earthquakes.
In this way the system we are analyzing connects a regime of uniform
deformation at large strain rates, a localized deformation regime in the form
of shear bands at intermediate stain rates, and seismic phenomena at very low
strain rate. The unifying ingredient of this phenomenology is the existence of
a reentrant flow curve, originated in the aging mechanisms present in the
model.

Random packings of stiff rods are self-supporting mechanical structures
stabilized by their geometrical and topological complexity. To understand why,
we deploy X-ray computerized tomography to unveil the structure of the packing.
This allows us to define and directly visualize the spatial variations in
"entanglement," a mesoscopic field that characterizes the local average
crossing number, a measure of the topological complexity of the packing. We
show that the entanglement field has information that is distinct from the
density, orientational order, and contact distribution of the packing. We find
that increasing the aspect ratio of the constituent rods in a packing leads to
an abrupt change in the entanglement, correlated with a sharp transition in the
mechanical response of the packing. This leads to an entanglement phase diagram
for the mechanical response of dense rod packings that is likely relevant for a
broad range of problems that goes beyond our specific study.

UTe2 is a newly discovered unconventional superconductor, where electron
Cooper pairs combine into a spin-triplet ground state. Here we report the
specific heat C(H,T) of a high-quality single crystal of UTe2 with a single
specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition temperature T_c
{\approx} 2 K and a small zero-field residual Sommerfeld coefficient {\gamma}_0
= C/T (T=0) = 10 mJ/mol-K^2. We applied magnetic field up to 12 T along the
three principal crystallographic axes of UTe2 to probe the nature of the
superconducting state. The evolution of the residual Sommerfeld coefficient as
a function of magnetic field, {\gamma}_0 (H), is highly anisotropic and reveals
distinct regions. In magnetic field up to 4 T applied along a, b, and c axes,
we find {\gamma}_0{\approx}{\alpha}_i {\square}H, with i=a,b,c, as expected for
an unconventional superconductor with nodes (zeros) of the superconducting
order parameter on the Fermi surface. A pronounced kink in {\gamma}_0(H),
however, is observed at roughly 4 T for field applied along both a and b axes,
whereas a smooth change from square-root to linear behaviour is observed at 4 T
for H//c. These results strongly indicate that a zero-field ground state is
stable up to 4 T and undergoes a field-induced evolution above 4 T. {\alpha_c}
> {\alpha_a} > {\alpha_b}, indicating that the nodes in the low-field state are
predominantly located in the vicinity of the a-b plane. The modification of the
order parameter is strongest when field is applied in the a-b plane, which
causes nodes to move away from the direction of the applied field. Both
d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) and d_(B_2u)+id_(A_u) two-component order parameters can
account for our observations, with d_(B_2u)+id_(B_1u) a more likely candidate.
In either scenario, our measurements indicate that B_2u is the primary
superconducting order parameter in UTe2.

Phononic engineering at GHz frequencies form the foundation of microwave
acoustic filters, high-speed acousto-optic modulators, and quantum transducers.
THz phononic engineering could lead to acoustic filters and modulators at
higher bandwidth and speed, as well as quantum circuits operating at higher
temperatures. It can also enable new ways to manipulate and control thermal
transport, as THz acoustic phonons are the main heat carriers in nonmetallic
solids. Despite its potential, methods for engineering THz phonons have been
little explored due to the challenges of achieving the required material
control at sub-nanometer precision and efficient phonon coupling at THz
frequencies. Here, we demonstrate efficient generation, detection, and
manipulation of THz phonons through precise integration of atomically thin
layers in van der Waals heterostructures. We employ few-layer graphene as an
ultrabroadband transducer, converting fs near-infrared pulses to broadband
acoustic phonon pulses with spectral content up to 3 THz. A single layer of
WSe$_2$ is used as a sensor, where high-fidelity readout is enabled by the
exciton-phonon coupling and strong light-matter interactions. By combining
these capabilities in a single van der Waals heterostructure and detecting
responses to incident mechanical waves, we performed THz phononic spectroscopy,
similar to conventional optical spectroscopy which detects responses to
incident electromagnetic waves. We demonstrate high-Q THz phononic cavities
using hBN stacks. We further show that a single layer of WSe$_2$ embedded in
hBN can efficiently block the transmission of THz phonons. By comparing our
measurements to a nanomechanical model, we obtain the important force constants
at the heterointerfaces. Our results could enable THz phononic metamaterials
based on van der Waals heterostructures, as well as novel routes for thermal
engineering.

We propose an extended Bogoliubov transformation in real space for spinless
fermions, based on which a class of Kitaev chains of length $2N$ with zero
chemical potential can be mapped to two independent Kitaev chains of length
$N$. It provides an alternative way to investigate a complicated system from
the result of relatively simple systems. We demonstrate the implications of
this decomposition by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Kitaev model, which supports
rich quantum phases. The features of the system, including the groundstate
topology and nonequilibrium dynamics, can be revealed directly from that of
sub-Kitaev chains. Based on this connection, two types of
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-pair order parameters are introduced to
characterize the phase diagram, showing the ingredient of two different BCS
pairing modes. Analytical analysis and numerical simulations show that the
real-space decomposition for the ground state still holds true approximately in
presence of finite chemical potential in the gapful regions.

microscopes, not only for data analytics but also for real-time decision-making
and feedback for microscope operation. However, the number of use cases for
real-time ML remains remarkably small. Here, we discuss some considerations in
designing ML-based active experiments and pose that the likely strategy for the
next several years will be human-in-the-loop automated experiments (hAE). In
this paradigm, the ML learning agent directly controls beam position and image
and spectroscopy acquisition functions, and human operator monitors experiment
progression in real- and feature space of the system and tunes the policies of

In this study, we address the limitations of previous solutions for modeling
high-order harmonics in semiconductor superlattices (SSLs). Earlier research
proposed a step function ansatz that effectively modeled high-order even and
odd harmonics but introduced numerical noise. An upgrade using a logistic
function addressed the noise problem but eliminated high-order odd harmonics.
To overcome both limitations, we examined the impact of the y-intercept value
in the discontinuity of the step function and proposed a modified logistic
function as a new ansatz. The modified logistic function delivers accurate
results, preserving high-order odd harmonics up to the 50th order similar to
the previous ansatz while also eliminating numerical noise. This research
contributes to a more efficient and robust analytical approach for modeling
SSLs, notably by avoiding time-consuming numerical solutions and enhancing our
understanding of nonlinear phenomena in GHz-THz devices.

Foam characterization is essential in many applications of foams, such as
cleaning, food processing, cosmetics, and oil production, due to these
applications diversified requirements. The standard characterization method,
the foam column test, cannot provide sufficient information for in-depth
studies. Hence, there have been many studies that incorporated different
characterization methods into the standard test. It should be enlightening and
feasible to measure the foam viscosity, which is both of practical and
fundamental interest, during the foam column test, but it has never been done
before. Here, we demonstrate a method to characterize aqueous foams and their
aging behaviors with simultaneous measurement of foam viscosity and foam
height. Using a vibration viscometer, we integrate foam column experiments with
in-situ foam viscosity measurements. We studied the correlation among the foam
structure, foam height, and foam viscosity during the foam decay process. We
found a drastic decrease in foam viscosity in the early foam decay while the
foam height remained unchanged, which is explained by coarsening. This method
is much more sensitive and time-efficient than conventional foam-height-based
methods by comparing the half-life. This method successfully characterizes the
stability of foams made of various combinations of surfactants and gases.

We investigate through numerical simulations how a two-dimensional crystal
yields and flows under an applied shear. We focus over a range that allows us
to both address the response in the limit of an infinitesimal shear rate and
describe the phase behavior of the system at a finite shear rate. In doing so,
we carefully discuss the role of the topological defects and of the finite-size
effects. We map out the whole phase diagram of the flowing steady state in the
plane formed by temperature and shear rate. Shear-induced melting of the
two-dimensional crystal is found to proceed in two steps: first, the solid
loses long-range bond-orientational order and flows, even for an infinitesimal
shear rate (in the thermodynamic limit). The resulting flowing hexatic phase
then melts to a flowing, rather isotropic, liquid at a finite shear rate that
depends on temperature. Finally, at a high shear rate, a third regime
corresponding to a strongly anisotropic string-like flowing phase appears.

Over the last few decades, both heat and broadband sound reduction have
become increasingly significant as a result of concerns about the environment
and noise pollution. In order to address this challenge, we provide a finite
element analysis study of an acoustic metamaterial panel consisting of a unit
cell made of two Helmholtz Resonators with a guide in between. These panels can
attenuate and control both sound propagation and heat flux. For noise pollution
in a building, we first determine the geometric dimension that corresponds to
the operative frequency range. Furthermore, we investigate the sound
transmission loss of the proposed panel as a function of the periodicity of an
array of unit cells. Additionally, we investigate the thermal flux induced by
the panel, especially within a 24-hour period. The simulation results show that
the proposed panel provides a level of sound attenuation within the frequency
range of 400 Hz to 2.5 kHz, as well as interesting heat protection. The
structure is compared to panels made up of a homogeneous medium and without

To understand the photophysics of molecular aggregates, exciton model of J-

aggregates can exhibit a high degree of symmetry. Herein, we utilized group
theory to study the optical properties of centrosymmetric molecular aggregates,
showing that their optical selection rules (transition dipole moment and
spin-orbit coupling) are determined by the symmetry of singlet and triplet
excited states and the intermolecular orbital overlap. Symmetry-forbidden
electronic transitions are closely related to ultralong organic
phosphorescence. Our model's scope is broad, as over 50% of organic crystals

Nonlinear spintronics has significant attention as it combines nonlinear
dynamics with spintronics, opening up new possibilities beyond linear
responses. A recent theoretical work [Cong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 166302
(2023)] predicts the nonlinear generation of spin density [nonlinear spin
Edelstein effect (NSEE)] in centrosymmetric metals based on symmetry analysis
combined with first principle calculation. However, its microscopic mechanism
remains unclear. This paper focuses on the fundamental role of orbital degrees
of freedom for the nonlinear generation in centrosymmetric systems. Using a
combination of tight-binding model and density functional theory calculations,
we demonstrate that nonlinear orbital density can arise independently of
spin-orbit coupling. In contrast, spin density follows through spin-orbit
coupling. We further elucidate the microscopic mechanism responsible for this
phenomenon, which involves the NSEE induced by electric-field-induced orbital
Rashba texture. We also find that the NSEE is significantly influenced by the
energy level broadening and that most materials previously predicted to exhibit
strong NSEE exhibit negligible NSEE for the energy level broadening of the
order of room temperature but demonstrate substantial NSEE only when the energy
level broadening is reduced. In addition, we also explore the potential
applications of the nonlinear orbital and spin Edelstein effect for field-free
switching.

We report the growth of high-quality GaN epitaxial thin films on
graphene-coated c-sapphire substrates using pulsed-mode metalorganic
vapor-phase epitaxy, together with the fabrication of freestanding GaN films by
simple mechanical exfoliation for transferable light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
High-quality GaN films grown on the graphene-coated sapphire substrates were
easily lifted off using thermal release tape and transferred onto foreign
substrates. Furthermore, we revealed that the pulsed operation of ammonia flow
during GaN growth was a critical factor for the fabrication of high-quality
freestanding GaN films. These films, exhibiting excellent single crystallinity,
were utilized to fabricate transferable GaN LEDs by heteroepitaxially growing
InxGa1-xN/GaN multiple quantum wells and a p-GaN layer on the GaN films,
showing their potential application in advanced optoelectronic devices.

<br>
Spontaneous generation of time-reversal symmetry breaking in unconventional
superconductors is currently a topic of considerable interest. While chiral
superconducting order is often assumed to be the source of such signatures,
they can sometimes also arise from nonmagnetic disorder. Here we perform a
theoretical study of the impact of dislocations on the superconducting order
parameter within a microscopic one-band model which, in the homogeneous case,
features either extended $s$-wave, $d$-wave, or $s+id$-wave superconductivity
depending on the electron concentration. We find that the dislocations minimize
their impact on the superconducting condensate by inducing localized
supercurrents pinned by the dislocations, even well outside the $s+id$ regime.
We map out the parameter and density dependence of the induced currents. From
these results we conclude that quite generically unconventional superconductors
hosting dislocations tend to break time-reversal symmetry locally.

Metamaterials have gained popularity in recent years as a promising avenue
for producing innovative materials with distinctive properties that offer
unprecedented features. In this study, we address the thermal and acoustic
challenges of building materials. We numerically and experimentally investigate
a clay metaBrick, which is an innovative metamaterial design based on the
existing hollow brick that has shown strong sound and thermal performances. We
evaluate the acoustic and thermal characteristics of the clay metaBrick,
including sound transmission and heat resistance, using the finite element
method. Furthermore, we validate the results experimentally by investigating
the behaviors of the wall built on metaBricks in two tests: sound and thermal.
We contrast the findings of the metaBrick based wall with performances of a
standard hollow brick wall. The metaBrick offers enhanced acoustic and thermal
insulation properties compared to the standard brick, with a compressive
strength above standards required in the building materials.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the vortex lattice configuration in a rotating spin
orbit-coupled spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a
quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. By considering the interplay between
rotation frequency, spin-orbit couplings, and inter atomic interactions, we
explore a variety of vortex lattice structures emerging as a ground state
solution. Our study focuses on the combined effects of spin-orbit coupling and
rotation, analyzed by using the variational method for the single-particle
Hamiltonian. We observe that the interplay between rotation and Rashba
spin-orbit coupling gives rise to different effective potentials for the
bosons. Specifically, at higher rotation frequencies, isotropic spin-orbit
coupling leads to an effective toroidal potential, while fully anisotropic
spin-orbit coupling results in a symmetric double-well potential. To obtain
these findings, we solve the five coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the
spin-2 BEC with spin-orbit coupling under rotation. Notably, we find that the
antiferromagnetic, cyclic, and ferromagnetic phases exhibit similar behavior at
higher rotation.

<h3>Clustering in quasi-two-dimensional dispersions of Brownian particles  with competitive interactions: Phase diagram and structural properties</h3>

<br>
<br>
Competing short-range attractive (SA) and long range repulsive (LR)
interactions have been invoked to describe colloid or protein solutions, as
well as membrane proteins interactions mediated by lipid molecules. Using
Langevin dynamics simulations, we determine the generalized phase diagram, the
cluster shapes and size distributions of a generic Q2D dispersion of spherical
SALR particles confined to in-plane motion. SA and LR interactions are modelled
by a generalized Lenard-Jones potential and a screened Coulomb potential,
respectively. The microstructures of the various equilibrium and
non-equilibrium phases turn out to be distinctly different from the ones
observed in three-dimensional (3D) SALR systems. We discuss perturbation theory
predictions for the metastable binodal line of a reference system of particles
with SA interactions only, which in the Q2D-SALR phase diagram separates
cluster from non-cluster phases. The transition from the high-temperature (low
SA) dispersed fluid phase to the lower-temperature equilibrium cluster phase is
characterised by a low-wavenumber peak of the static structure factor
(corresponding to a thermal correlation length of about twice the particle
diameter) featuring a distinctly smaller height ($\approx1.4$) than in 3D SALR
systems. By further decreasing the temperature (increasing SA), the cluster
morphology changes from disk-like shapes in the equilibrium cluster phase, to
double-stranded anisotropic hexagonal cluster forms in the cluster-percolated
gel phase. This transition is quantified by the hexagonal order parameter
distribution function. The mean cluster size and coordination number of
particles in the gel phase are insensitive to changes in the attraction
strength.

<h3>Photo-induced nonequilibrium states in Mott insulators</h3>

The study of nonequilibrium phenomena in interacting lattice systems can
provide new perspectives on correlation effects, and information on metastable
states of matter. Mott insulators are a promising class of systems for
nonequilibrium studies, since they exhibit exotic phenomena and complex phase
diagrams upon doping, and because a large Mott gap provides protection against
fast thermalization and heating after photo-excitations. We can thus expect the
emergence of interesting transient states and photo-induced phases in Mott
systems. This review presents the current understanding of the mechanisms which
control the time evolution of photo-doped charge carriers and the properties of
photo-induced metastable states. We focus on recent theoretical progress,
identify the relevant underlying concepts, and link them to experimental
observations. The review starts with a general discussion of field-induced
nonequilibrium setups and an overview of key experiments which revealed
characteristic properties of photo-excited Mott states, proceeds with a compact
overview of the theoretical tools which have been developed to investigate
these strongly correlated nonequilibrium states, and then analyzes Mott
insulators driven out of equilibrium by static electric fields, periodic
fields, and short laser pulses. We also discuss the appearance of nonthermal
electronic orders in photo-excited Mott systems, including nonthermal spin and
orbital orders, $\eta$ pairing states, and novel types of excitonic orders.

<br>
<br>
We study a solution of interacting semiflexible polymers with curvature
energy in poor-solvent conditions on the d-dimensional cubic lattice using
mean-field theory and Monte Carlo computer simulations. Building upon past
studies on a single chain, we construct a field-theory representation of the
system and solve it within a mean-field approximation supported by Monte Carlo
simulations in d=3. A gas-liquid transition is found in the temperature-density
plane that is then interpreted in terms of real systems. Interestingly, we find
this transition to be independent of the bending rigidity. Past classical
Flory-Huggins and Flory mean-field results are shown to be particular cases of
this more general framework. Perspectives in terms of guiding experimental
results towards optimal conditions are also proposed.

<br>
$\require{mhchem}$The square-kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet is a
highly frustrated Hamiltonian whose material realizations have been scarce. We
theoretically investigate the recently synthesized $\ce{Na6Cu7BiO4(PO4)4Cl3}$
where a Cu$^{2+}$ spin-$1/2$ square-kagome lattice (with six site unit cell) is
decorated by a seventh magnetic site alternatingly above and below the layers.
The material does not show any sign of long-range magnetic order down to 50 mK
despite a Curie-Weiss temperature of $-212$ K indicating a quantum paramagnetic
phase. Our DFT energy mapping elicits a purely antiferromagnetic Hamiltonian
that features longer range exchange interactions beyond the pure square-kagome
model and, importantly, we find the seventh site to be strongly coupled to the
plane. We combine two variational Monte Carlo approaches,
pseudo-fermion/Majorana functional renormalization group and Schwinger-Boson
mean field calculations to show that the complex Hamiltonian of
$\ce{Na6Cu7BiO4(PO4)4Cl3}$ still features a nonmagnetic ground state. We
explain how the seventh Cu$^{2+}$ site actually aids the stabilization of the
disordered state. We predict static and dynamic spin structure factors to guide
future neutron scattering experiments.

We study the percolation velocity, $v_p,$ of a fine spherical particle in a
sheared large-particle bed under gravity using discrete element method
simulations for large-to-fine particle diameter ratios, $R=d/d_f,$ below and
above the free-sifting threshold, $R_t\approx6.5.$ For $R<R_t,$ $v_p$ initially
increases with increasing shear rate, $\dot\gamma,$ as shear-driven bed
rearrangement reduces fine-particle trapping but then decreases toward zero due
to fine-particle excitation for $\dot\gamma\sqrt{d/g}\gtrsim 0.1$. For $R>R_t$,
$v_p$ is constant at low $\dot\gamma$ but decreases toward zero at higher shear
rates due to fine-particle excitation.

Exploring various topological states (TS) and topological phase transitions
(TPT) has attracted great attention in condensed matter physics. However, so
far, there is rarely a typical material system that can be used as a platform
to study the TS and TPT as the system transforms from one-dimensional (1D)
nanoribbons to two-dimensional (2D) sheet then to three-dimensional (3D) bulk.
Here, we first propose that some typical TS in 1D, 2D, and 3D systems can be
realized in a tight-binding (TB) model. Following the TB model and further
based on first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate
that the structurally stable (4,0) carbon nanotube derivatives are an ideal
platform to explore the semiconductor/nodal-point semimetal states in 1D
nanoribbons [1D-(4,0)-C16H4 and 1D-(4,0)-C32H4], nodal-ring semimetal state in
2D sheet [2D-(4,0)-C16], and nodal-cage semimetal state in 3D bulk
[3D-(4,0)-C16]. Furthermore, we calculate the characteristic band structures
and the edge/surface states of 2D-(4,0)-C16 and 3D-(4,0)-C16 to confirm their
nontrivial topological properties. Our work not only provides new excellent 2D
and 3D members for the topological carbon material family, but also serves as
an ideal template for the study of TS and TPT with the change of system
dimension.

We report measurements on the dynamics of the Debye layer at a gold electrode
in several electrolytes. In the experiments, the Debye layer transmits a damped
voltage wave along the electrode, which we use to probe the dynamics. We
compare the measurements with traditional impedance models, which schematize
the Debye layer as a capacitance. We find good agreement for very dilute
electrolytes, but also for an ionic liquid. However, the same model fails for
the concentrated electrolyte, as ion - solvent - ion interactions become
important.

When modeling charge dynamics in a chain of N sites at a temperature T, a
Langevin thermostat and a Hamiltonian system, i.e., a chain heated to a given
temperature before charge is injected, are compared. It is shown that the
polaron disruption occurs in the same range of values of the thermal energy NT,
however, T is not given by the initial data, but obtained after simulation from
the average kinetic energy. For large T, the results averaged over a set of
trajectories in a system with a Langevin thermostat and the results averaged
over time for a Hamiltonian system are close, which does not contradict the

Lithium disilicate glasses and glass-ceramics are good potential candidates
for biomedical applications and solid-state batteries, and serve as models of
nucleation and crystal growth. Moreover, these glasses exhibit a phase
separation that influences their nucleation and crystallization behavior. The
atomistic mechanisms of the phase separation and their pressure dependence are
unclear so far. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations supported by
experiments to assess the spatial heterogeneity of lithium disilicate glasses
prepared under pressure. We show that the glass heterogeneity decreases with
increasing the cooling pressure and almost disappears at pressures around 30
GPa. The origin of the heterogeneity is due to the attraction between Li
cations to form clustering channels, which decreases with pressure. Through our
results, we hope to provide valuable insights and guidance for making
glass-ceramics with controlled crystallization.

<h3>Combining the D3 dispersion correction with the neuroevolution  machine-learned potential</h3>

<br>
<br>
Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have become a popular approach of modelling
interatomic interactions in atomistic simulations, but to keep the
computational cost under control, a relatively short cutoff must be imposed,
which put serious restrictions on the capability of the MLPs for modelling
relatively long-ranged dispersion interactions. In this paper, we propose to
combine the neuroevolution potential (NEP) with the popular D3 correction to
achieve a unified NEP-D3 model that can simultaneously model relatively
short-ranged bonded interactions and relatively long-ranged dispersion
interactions. We show the improved descriptions of the binding and sliding
energies in bilayer graphene can be obtained by the NEP-D3 approach compared to
the pure NEP approach. We implement the D3 part into the GPUMD package such
that it can be used out of the box for many exchange-correlation functionals.
As a realistic application, we show that dispersion interactions result in
approximately a 10% reduction in thermal conductivity for three typical
metal-organic frameworks.

The topological electronic structure of crystalline materials often gives
rise to intriguing surface states, such as Dirac surface states in topological
insulators, Fermi arc surface states in Dirac semimetals, and topological
superconductivity in iron-based superconductors. Recently, rhombohedral
multilayer graphene has emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic
surface states due to its hosting of topologically protected surface flat bands
at low energy, with the layer-dependent energy dispersion. These flat bands can
promote electron correlations, leading to a plethora of quantum phenomena,
including spontaneous symmetry breaking, superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and
topological Chern insulators. Nevertheless, the intricate connection between
the surface flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene and the highly
dispersive high-energy bands hinders the exploration of correlated surface
states. Here, we present a method to isolate the surface flat bands of
rhombohedral heptalayer (7L) graphene by introducing moire superlattices. The
pronounced screening effects observed in the moire potential-modulated
rhombohedral 7L graphene indicate its essential three-dimensional (3D) nature.
The isolated surface flat bands favor correlated states on the surface in the
regions away from charge-neutrality points. Most notably, we observe tunable
surface ferromagnetism, manifested as an anomalous Hall effect with hysteresis
loops, which is achieved by polarizing surface states using finite displacement
fields. Our work establishes rhombohedral multilayer graphene moire
superlattice as a unique 3D system for exploring correlated surface states.

We propose the rotational dynamics of the intralayer and interlayer excitons
with their inherent momenta of inertia in the monolayer and bilayer transition
metal dichalcogenides, respectively, where the new chirality of exciton is
endowed by the rotational angular momentum, namely, the formations of left- and
right-handed excitons at the +K and -K valleys, respectively. We find that
angular momenta exchange between excitons and its surrounding phononic bath
result in the large fluctuation of the effective g-factor and the asymmetry of
valley Zeeman splitting observed in most recently experiments, both of which
sensitively depend on the magnetic moments provided by the phononic
environment. This rotating exciton model not only proposes a new controllable
knob in valleytronics, but opens the door to explore the angular momentum
exchange of the chiral quasiparticles with the many-body environment.

The quantum anomalous Hall state with a large band gap and a high Chern
number is significant for practical applications in spintronics. By performing
first-principles calculations, we investigate electronic properties of the
fully fluorinated 1T-MoSe$_{2}$ monolayer. Without considering the spin-orbit
coupling, the band structure demonstrates single-spin semi-metallic properties
and the trigonal warping around $K_{\pm}$ valleys. The introduction of the
spin-orbit coupling opens considerable band gaps of $117.2$ meV around the two
valleys, leading to a nontrivial quantum anomalous Hall state with a Chern
number of $|C|=2$, which provides two chiral dissipationless transport channels
from topological edge states and associated quantized anomalous Hall
conductivity. In addition, an effective model is constructed to describe the
low-energy physics of the monolayer. Our findings in the MoSe$_{2}$F$_{2}$
monolayer sheds light on large-gap quantum anomalous Hall states in
two-dimensional materials with the chemical functionalization, and provides
opportunities in designing low-power and noise-tolerant spintronic devices.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D
superconductors. For nodal d-wave superconductors, it is found that the thermal
(static) phase fluctuations in the normal state significantly broaden the
d-wave nodes, and lead to the pseudogap and accompanying Fermi arcs in a quite
general manner. The formation of Fermi arcs can be depicted by the
intertwinement between d-wave superconductivity and the scattering of Cooper
pairs. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the
observation of Fermi arcs in a concrete lattice model, proposed originally by
X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 217002 (2021), using the
determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method without the infamous sign
problem. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a highly-correlated
model that the Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased DQMC simulations.
Despite the conciseness of our theory, our simulation results confirm the
theoretical predictions qualitatively.

Local atomic environment descriptors (LAEDs) are used in the materials
science and chemistry communities, for example, for the development of machine
learning interatomic potentials. Despite the fact that LAEDs have been
extensively studied and benchmarked for various applications, global structure
descriptors (GSDs), i.e., descriptors for entire molecules or crystal
structures, have been mostly developed independently based on other approaches.
Here, we propose a systematically improvable methodology for constructing a
space of representations of GSDs from LAEDs by incorporating statistical
information and information about chemical elements. We apply the method to
construct GSDs of varying complexity for lithium thiophosphate structures that
are of interest as solid electrolytes and use an information-theoretic approach
to obtain an optimally compressed GSD. Finally, we report the performance of
the compressed GSD for energy prediction tasks.

<h3>Challenges for density functional theory in simulating metal-metal  singlet bonding: a case study of dimerized VO2</h3>

<br>
<br>
VO2 is renowned for its electric transition from an insulating monoclinic
(M1) phase characterized by V-V dimerized structures, to a metallic rutile (R)
phase above 340 Kelvin. This transition is accompanied by a magnetic change:
the M1 phase exhibits a non-magnetic spin-singlet state, while the R phase
exhibits a state with local magnetic moments. Simultaneous simulation of the
structural, electric, and magnetic properties of this compound is of
fundamental importance, but the M1 phase alone has posed a significant
challenge to density functional theory (DFT). In this study, we show none of
the commonly used DFT functionals, including those combined with on-site
Hubbard U to better treat 3d electrons, can accurately predict the V-V dimer
length. The spin-restricted method tends to overestimate the strength of the
V-V bonds, resulting in a small V-V bond length. Conversely, the
spin-symmetry-breaking method exhibits the opposite trends. Each
bond-calculation method underscores one of the two contentious mechanisms,
i.e., Peierls or Mott, involved in the metal-insulator transition in VO2. To
elucidate the challenges encountered in DFT, we also employ an effective
Hamiltonian that integrates one-dimensional magnetic sites, thereby revealing
the inherent difficulties linked with the DFT computations.

We propose an effective lattice model for the Moir\'e structure of twisted
bilayer dice lattice. We find that there are flat bands near zero energy level
at any twist angle besides the magic ones. The flat bands contain both bands
with zero Chern number which are originated from the destructive interference
of the dice lattice and the topological non-trivial ones at the magic angle.
The existence of the flat bands can be detected from the peak-splitting fine
structure of the optical conductance at all angles, while the transition peaks
do not split and only occur at magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene.

<h3>Modeling the effects of varying Ti concentration on the mechanical  properties of Cu-Ti alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
The mechanical properties of Cu-Ti alloys have been characterized extensively
through experimental studies. However, a detailed understanding of why the
strength of Cu increases after a small fraction of Ti atoms is added to the
alloy is still missing. In this work, we address this question using density
functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with modified
embedded atom method (MEAM) interatomic potentials. First, we performed
calculations of uniaxial tension deformations of small bicrystalline Cu cells
using DFT static simulations. We then carried out uniaxial tension deformations
on much larger bicrystalline and polycrystalline Cu cells using MEAM MD
simulations. In bicrystalline Cu, the inclusion of Ti increases the grain
boundary separation energy and maximum tensile stress. The DFT calculations
demonstrate that the increase in tensile stress can be attributed to an
increase in the local charge density arising from Ti. MEAM simulations in
larger bicrystalline systems have shown that increasing the Ti concentration
decreases the density of stacking faults. This observation is enhanced in
polycrystalline Cu, where the addition of Ti atoms, even at concentrations as
low as 1.5 at.%, increases the yield strength and elastic modulus of the
material compared to pure Cu. Under uniaxial tensile loading, the addition of
small amounts of Ti hinders the formation of partial Shockley dislocations in
the grain boundaries of Cu, leading to reduced local deformation. These results
shed light on the role of Ti in determining the mechanical properties of
polycrystalline Cu and will enable the engineering of grain boundaries and the
inclusion of Ti to improve degradation resistance.

Metallic dopants have the potential to increase the mechanical strength of
polycrystalline metals. These elements are expected to aggregate in regions of
lower coordination, such as grain boundaries. At the grain boundaries, they can
have a beneficial (toughening) or detrimental effect (e.g. grain boundary
embrittlement). In this study, we employ Density Functional Theory (DFT) to
compute the segregation energies of various metallic and other non-metallic
elements to determine their effect when introduced in a symmetric Cu grain
boundary. The study results may be used to qualitatively rank the beneficial
effect of certain metallic elements, such as V, Zr, and Ag, as well as the
strong weakening effect of non-metallic impurities like O, S, F and P.
Furthermore, the induced local distortion is found to be proportional to the
weakening effect of the elements.

<br>
<br>
The traditional approach to studying near-field thermal radiation is based on
fluctuational electrodynamics. However, this approach may not be suitable for
nonequilibrium states due to dynamic drivings. In our work, we propose a
theoretical formalism that describes near-field radiative heat transfer in the
presence of periodic time modulations. We utilize the machinery of
nonequilibrium Green's function to derive general expressions for the radiative
energy current in Floquet space. Using our theoretical framework, we
specifically investigate the scenario of periodically driving the electronic
reservoir. The external drivings create a nonequilibrium state, which gives
rise to various effects such as heat-transfer enhancement, heat-transfer
suppression, and radiative cooling. To illustrate these phenomena, we conduct
numerical calculations on a system of Coulomb-coupled quantum dots.

<h3>Observation of universal Kibble-Zurek scaling in an atomic Fermi  superfluid</h3>

<br>
<i>Kyuhwan Lee, Sol Kim, Taehoon Kim, Yong-il Shin</i>
<br>
<br>
Half a century ago, T. Kibble proposed a scenario for topological defect
formation from symmetry breaking during the expansion of the early Universe. W.
Zurek later crystallized the concept to superfluid helium, predicting a
power-law relation between the number of quantum vortices and the rate at which
the system passes through the lambda transition. Here, we report the
observation of Kibble-Zurek scaling in a homogeneous, strongly interacting
Fermi gas undergoing a superfluid phase transition. We investigate the
superfluid transition using two distinct control parameters: temperature and
interaction strength. The microscopic physics of condensate formation is
markedly different for the two quench parameters, signaled by their two orders
of magnitude difference in the condensate formation timescale. However,
regardless of the thermodynamic direction in which the system passes through a
phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek exponent is identically observed to be about
0.68 and shows good agreement with theoretical predictions that describe
superfluid phase transitions. This work demonstrates the gedanken experiment
Zurek proposed for liquid helium that shares the same universality class with
strongly interacting Fermi gases.

The development of new computing technologies has given a new stimulus in the
study of multiferroics. The use of multiferroics allows the realization of
competitive energy efficient scalable logic and storage devices. The low-power
consumption in Magneto Electric-Spin Orbital logics and Magnetic Random Access
Memory components is provided by magnetoelectric switching in multiferroic
based systems using a low-energy electric field. Our work concerns the
modelling of the Magneto Electric-Spin Orbital elements with an emphasis on the
magnetoelectric component and simulation of magnetization reversal processes in
a model system. The use of the proposed approach makes it possible to analyze
the influence of dimensional factors (film thicknesses, transverse dimensions,
sample shape) affecting the magnetic states of multiferroic nanoelements;
taking into interfacial interactions (magnetic anisotropy and interlayer
exchange); energy-efficient external influences that allow switching magnetic
states using magnetic and electric fields.

<h3>Control of valley optical conductivity and topological phases in buckled  hexagonal lattice by orientation of in-plane magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<i>Phusit Nualpijit, Bumned Soodchomshom</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the optical conductivity, along with longitudinal and
transverse conductivities, in buckled hexagonal lattice such as silicene
subjected to both an in-plane magnetic field and a perpendicular electric
field. In this model, we neglect the effect of the spin-orbit interaction,
which is of a smaller order compared to the strong staggered potential and the
next-nearest hoping energy. The orientations of the in-plane magnetic field and
the perpendicular electric field give rise to a non-uniform, tunable gap. The
Chern number for each valley degree of freedom deviates from being constant but
remains steady when summed over the entire Brillouin zone. The longitudinal and
transverse currents, in the case of a specific valley, can be selected by
adjusting the direction of the electric field in the semimetal phase.
Furthermore, the defining characteristics of topological phases induces the
rapid change in longitudinal conductivity when varying the angle of orientation
of the in-plane magnetic field under monochromatic light, and perfect valley
filtering in transverse conductivity. The transverse current associated with a
specific valley can be selected when the angle of orientation satisfies the
specific conditions. This investigation paves the way for materials design with
valley-locked current, using a specific orientation of the in-plane magnetic
field.

<h3>Avalanche properties at the yielding transition: from externally  deformed glasses to active systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Carlos Villarroel, Gustavo Düring</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigated the yielding phenomenon in the quasistatic limit using
numerical simulations of soft particles. Two different deformation scenarios,
simple shear (passive) and self-random force (active), and two interaction
potentials were used. Our approach reveals that the exponents describing the
avalanche distribution are universal within the margin of error, showing
consistency between the passive and active systems. This indicates that any
differences observed in the flow curves may have resulted from a dynamic effect
on the avalanche propagation mechanism. The evolution time required to reach a
steady state differs significantly between active and passive scenarios under
similar conditions. However, we demonstrated that plastic avalanches under
athermal quasistatic simulation dynamics display a similar scaling relationship
between avalanche size and relaxation time, which cannot explain the different
flow curves.

<h3>Generalized Landauer bound from absolute irreversibility</h3>

<br>
<i>Lorenzo Buffoni, Francesco Coghi, Stefano Gherardini</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we introduce a generalization of the Landauer bound for erasure
processes that stems from absolutely irreversible dynamics. Assuming that the
erasure process is carried out in an absolutely irreversible way so that the
probability of observing some trajectories is zero in the forward process but
finite in the reverse process, we derive a generalized form of the bound for
the average erasure work, which is valid also for imperfect erasure and
asymmetric bits. The generalized bound obtained is tighter or, at worst, as
tight as existing ones. Our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical
experiments and the comparison with data from previous works.

<br>
<br>
Materials with kagome lattice have attracted significant research attention
due to their nontrivial features in energy bands. In this work, we
theoretically investigate the evolution of electronic band structures of kagome
lattice in response to uniaxial strain using both a tight-binding model and an
antidot model based on a periodic muffin-tin potential. It is found that the
Dirac points move with applied strain. Furthermore, the flat band of unstrained
kagome lattice is found to develop into a highly anisotropic shape under a
stretching strain along y direction, forming a partially flat band with a
region dispersionless along ky direction while dispersive along kx direction.
Our results shed light on the possibility of engineering the electronic band
structures of kagome materials by mechanical strain.

<br>
<br>
LaMnO$_3$ (LMO) thin films epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) usually
exhibit ferromagnetism above a critical layer thickness. We report the use of
scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM) to study the suppression of the ferromagnetism
in STO/LMO/metal structures. By partially covering the LMO surface with a
metallic layer, both covered and uncovered LMO regions can be studied
simultaneously. While Au does not significantly influence the ferromagnetic
order of the underlying LMO film, a thin Ti layer induces a strong suppression
of the ferromagnetism, over tens of nanometers, and a large change in the
out-of-plane lattice parameter. We relate the suppression of the ferromagnetism
to the scavenging of oxygen and diffusion of Ti approximately 5 nanometers deep
into the film, which takes place at timescales of days. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that by patterning Ti/Au overlayers, we can define ferromagnetic
structures down to sub-micrometer scales.

<h3>Pressure-Driven Transitions in La2CoTiO6: Antiferromagnetic Insulator to  Nonmagnetic Metal via Antiferromagnetic Metal in a Double Perovskite Oxide</h3>

<br>
<br>
La$_2$CoTiO$6$ (LCTO), a double perovskite oxide, transitions from an
antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM-I) to an antiferromagnetic metal (AFM-M) and
eventually to a nonmagnetic metal (NM-M) under external hydrostatic pressure.
This pressure-driven sequence is accompanied by a shift in spin states, with a
remarkable spin-state transition from high-spin (HS) to low-spin (LS) at $\sim$
42 GPa. Monoclinic distortion induced by pressure plays a key role in this
transition. Even under ambient conditions, the LS state persists in a highly
symmetric theoretical structure, highlighting the role of distortion in
facilitating the HS to LS transition. In the LS state, LCTO becomes metallic,
even with a strong local correlation (Hubbard $U$) on Co. This transition is
elucidated through an energy level diagram, revealing a substantial
modification in the crystal field splitting between Co-$t{2g}$ and -$e_g$
levels due to strong Co-$d$ and O-$p$ orbital hybridization. Beyond 130 GPa,
the system enters the NM-M phase, completely quenching the magnetic moment on
Co.

<br>
<br>
Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) insulators possess distinct helical in-gap states,
enabling their edge states to act as one-dimensional conducting channels when
backscattering is prohibited by time-reversal symmetry. However, it remains
challenging to achieve high-performance combinations of nontrivial topological
QSH states with superconductivity for applications and requires understanding
of the complicated underlying mechanisms. Here, our experimental observations
for a novel superconducting phase in the pressurized QSH insulator Ta2Pd3Te5 is
reported, and the high-pressure phase maintains its original ambient pressure
lattice symmetry up to 45 GPa. Our in-situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray
diffraction, electrical transport, infrared reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy
measurements, in combination with rigorous theoretical calculations, provide
compelling evidence for the association between the superconducting behavior
and the abnormal densified phase. The isostructural transition was found to
modify the topology of the Fermi surface directly, accompanied by a fivefold
amplification of the density of states at 20 GPa compared to ambient pressure,
which synergistically fosters the emergence of robust superconductivity. A
profound comprehension of the fascinating properties exhibited by the
compressed Ta2Pd3Te5 phase is achieved, highlighting the extraordinary
potential of van der Waals (vdW) QSH insulators for exploring and investigating
high-performance electronic advanced devices under extreme conditions.

<h3>Janus helices: From fully attractive to hard helices</h3>

<br>
<br>
The phase diagram of hard helices differs from its hard rods counterpart by
the presence of chiral "screw" phases stemming from the characteristic helical
shape, in addition to the conventional liquid crystal phases also found for
rod-like particles. Using extensive Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics
simulations, we study the effect of the addition of a short-range attractive
tail representing solvent-induced interactions to a fraction of the sites
forming the hard helices, ranging from a single-site attraction to fully
attractive helices for a specific helical shape. Different temperature regimes
exist for different fractions of the attractive sites, as assessed in terms of
the relative Boyle temperatures, that are found to be rather insensitive to the
specific shape of the helical particle. The temperature range probed by the
present study is well above the corresponding Boyle temperatures, with the
phase behaviour still mainly entropically dominated and with the existence and
location of the various liquid crystal phases only marginally affected. The
pressure in the equation of state is found to decrease upon increasing the
fraction of attractive beads and/or on lowering the temperature at fixed volume
fraction, as expected on physical grounds. All screw phases are found to be
stable within the considered range of temperatures with the smectic phase
becoming more stable on lowering the temperature. By contrast, the location of
the transition lines do not display a simple dependence on the fraction of
attractive beads in the considered range of temperatures.

<h3>Spin susceptibility in interacting two-dimensional semiconductors and  bilayer systems at first order: Kohn anomalies and spin density wave ordering</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
This work is an analytic theoretical study of a 2D semiconductor with a Fermi
surface that is split by the Zeeman coupling of electron spins to an external
magnetic field in the presence of electron-electron interactions. For the first
time, we calculate the spin susceptibility for long-range and finite-range
interactions diagrammatically, and find a resonant peak structure at the Kohn
anomaly already in first-order perturbation theory. In contrast to the
density-density correlator that is suppressed due to the large electrostatic
energy required to stabilize charge density order, the spin susceptibility does
not suffer from electrostatic screening effects, thus favouring
spin-density-wave order in 2D semiconductors. Our results impose significant
consequences for determining magnetic phases in 2D semiconductors. For example,
a strongly enhanced Kohn anomaly may result in helical ordering of magnetic
impurities due to the RKKY interaction. Furthermore, the spin degree of freedom
can equally represent a layer pseudospin in the case of bilayer materials. In
this case, the external "magnetic field" is a combination of layer bias and
interlayer hopping. The sharp peak of the 2D static spin susceptibility may
then be responsible for dipole-density-wave order in bilayer materials at large
enough electron-phonon coupling.

<h3>Understanding correlations in BaZrO3:Structure and dynamics on the  nano-scale</h3>

Barium zirconate BaZrO3 is one of few perovskites that is claimed to retain
an average cubic structure down to 0K at ambient pressure, while being
energetically very close to a tetragonal phase obtained by condensation of a
soft phonon mode at the R-point. Previous studies suggest, however, that the
local structure of BaZrO3 may change at low temperature forming nanodomains or
a glass-like phase. Here, we investigate the global and local structure of
BaZrO3 as a function of temperature and pressure via molecular dynamics
simulations using a machine-learned potential with near density functional
theory (DFT) accuracy. We show that the softening of the octahedral tilt mode
at the R-point gives rise to weak diffuse superlattice reflections at low
temperatures and ambient pressure, which are also observed experimentally.
However, we do not observe any static nanodomains but rather soft dynamic
fluctuations of the ZrO6 octahedra with a correlation length of 2 to 3nm over
time-scales of about 1ps. This soft dynamic behaviour is the precursor of a
phase transition and explains the emergence of weak superlattice peaks in
measurements. On the other hand, when increasing the pressure at 300K we find a
phase transition from the cubic to the tetragonal phase at around 16GPa, also
in agreement with experimental studies.

We discuss a two-parameter renormalization group (RG) consideration of a
phyllotaxis model in the framework of the ``energetic approach'' proposed by L.
Levitov in 1991. Following L. Levitov, we consider an equilibrium distribution
of strongly repulsive particles on the surface of a finite cylinder and study
the redistribution of these particles when the cylinder is squeezed along its
axis. We construct explicitly the $\beta$-function of a given system in terms
of the modular Dedekind $\eta$-function. On basis of this $\beta$-function we
derive the equations describing the RG flow in the vicinity of the bifurcation
points between different lattices. Analyzing the structure of RG equations, we
claim emergence of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions at strong
compression of the cylinder.

(In,Ga) alloy droplets are used to catalyse the growth of (In,Ga)As nanowires
by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111) substrates. The composition, morphology
and optical properties of these nanowires can be tuned by the employed
elemental fluxes. To incorporate more than 10% of In, a high In/(In+Ga) flux
ratio above 0.7 is required. We report a maximum In content of almost 30% in
bulk (In,Ga)As nanowires for an In/(In+Ga) flux ratio of 0.8. However, with
increasing In/(In+Ga) fl ux ratio, the nanowire length and diameter are notably
reduced. Using photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy on
nanowires covered by a passivating (In,Al)As shell, two luminescence bands are
observed. A significant segment of the nanowires shows homogeneous emission,
with a wavelength corresponding to the In content in this segment, while the
consumption of the catalyst droplet leads to a spectrally-shifted emission band
at the top of the nanowires. The (In,Ga)As nanowires studied in this work
provide a new approach for the integration of infrared emitters on Si
platforms.

<br>
<br>
External piecewise-constant feedback control can modify energetic and
entropic balances, allowing in extreme scenarios for Maxwell demon operational
modes. Without specifying the actual implementation of external feedback loops,
one can only partially quantify the additional contributions to entropy
production. This is different in autonomously operating systems with internal
feedback. Traditional (bipartite) autonomous systems can be divided into
controller and a controlled subsystem, but also non-bipartite systems can
accomplish the same task. We consider examples of autonomous three-terminal
models that transfer heat mainly from a cold to a hot reservoir by dumping a
small fraction of it to an ultra-cold (demon) reservoir, such that their
coarse-grained dynamics resembles an external feedback loop. We find that the
minimal three-level implementation is most efficient in utilizing heat
dissipation to change the entropy balance of the effective controlled system.

<br>
<br>
Recent discovery of superconductivity at a transition temperature of $73$K in
the doped layered compound Ba$_{2}$CuO$_{3+x}$ for $x\sim 0.2$ has generated a
lot of interest. Experiments in this alternately stacked oxygen octahedral and
chain layered structure reveal that a compression of the octahedra causes the
Cu- {$d_{z^{2}}$} orbital to lie above the Cu- {$d_{x^2-y^2}$} orbital unlike
in the well-known cuprate superconducting materials. Our first-principle
calculations and low-energy Hamiltonian studies on the $x$ = 0.25 system reveal
that this energy ordering results in the formation of $d_{z^2}$ dominated
electron pockets. The strong nesting in the Fermi pockets leads to an AFM spin
fluctuation mediated $d_{xy}$ wave superconducting state dominated by pairing
among the $d_{z^{2}}$ orbitals. This is in contrast to the cuprate
superconductors (e.g., YBCO) where both electron and hole pockets exist and the
superconducting state with B$_{1g}$ symmetry is formed by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbital electrons. Unlike the earlier reports, we find that inter-layer
hybridization has an important contribution to the low-energy band structure
and formation of the unconventional superconducting state.

<br>
Spin dynamics is usually described as massless or, more precisely, as free of
inertia. Recent experiments, however, found direct evidence for inertial spin
dynamics. In turn, it is necessary to rethink the basics of spin dynamics.
Focusing on a macrospin in an environment (bath), we show that the spin-to-bath
coupling gives rise to spin inertia. This bath-induced spin inertia appears
universally from all the high-frequency bath modes. We expect our results to
provide new insights into recent experiments on spin inertia. Moreover, they
indicate that any channel for spin dissipation should also be accompanied by a
term accounting for bath-induced spin inertia. As an illustrative example, we
consider phonon-bath-induced spin inertia in a YIG/GGG stack.

<i>Lucien Jezequel, Pierre Delplace</i>
<br>

We propose a theory, that we call the \textit{mode-shell correspondence},
which relates the topological zero-modes localised in phase space to a
\textit{shell} invariant defined on the surface forming a shell enclosing these
zero-modes. We show that the mode-shell formalism provides a general framework
unifying important results of topological physics, such as the bulk-edge
correspondence, higher-order topological insulators, but also the Atiyah-Singer
and the Callias index theories. In this paper, we discuss the already rich
phenomenology of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians where the topological quantity
is the chiral number of zero-dimensionial zero-energy modes. We explain how, in
a lot of cases, the shell-invariant has a semi-classical limit expressed as a
generalised winding number on the shell, which makes it accessible to
analytical computations.

<h3>Avalanche shapes in fiber bundle model</h3>

<br>
<i>Narendra Kumar Bodaballa, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Parongama Sen</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the temporal evolution of avalanches in the fiber bundle model of
disordered solids, when the model is gradually driven towards the critical
breakdown point. We use two types of loading protocols: (i) the quasi-static
loading, and (ii) loading by a discrete amount. In the quasi-static loading,
where the load is increased by the minimum amount needed to initiate an
avalanche, the temporal shapes of avalanches are asymmetric away from the
critical point and become symmetric as the critical point is approached. A
measure of asymmetry follows a universal form $A\sim
(\sigma-\sigma_c)^{\theta}$, with $\theta\approx 0.25$, where $\sigma$ is the
load per fiber and $\sigma_c$ is the critical load per fiber. This behavior is
independent of the disorder present in the system in terms of the individual
failure threshold values. Thus it is possible to use this asymmetry measure as
a precursor to imminent failure. For the case of discrete loading, the load is
always increased by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the model in this case can
be solved in the mean field limit. It shows that the avalanche shapes always
remain asymmetric. We also present a variable range load sharing version of
this case, where the results remain qualitatively similar.

The growth of bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials on conventional 3D
semiconductors results in 2D/3D hybrid heterostructures, which can provide
additional advantages over more established 3D semiconductors while retaining
some specificities of 2D materials. Understanding and exploiting these
phenomena hinge on knowing the electronic properties and the hybridization of
these structures. Here, we demonstrate that rhombohedral-stacked bilayer (AB
stacking) can be obtained by molecular beam epitaxy growth of tungsten
diselenide (WSe2) on gallium phosphide (GaP) substrate. We confirm the presence
of 3R-stacking of the WSe2 bilayer structure using scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Also, we report
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on our
rhombohedral-stacked WSe2 bilayer grown on GaP(111)B substrate. Our ARPES
measurements confirm the expected valence band structure of WSe2 with the band
maximum located at the gamma point of the Brillouin zone. The epitaxial growth
of WSe2 on GaP(111)B heterostructures paves the way for further studies of the
fundamental properties of these complex materials, as well as prospects for
their implementation in devices to exploit their promising electronic and
optical properties.

Semiconductor quantum dots in close proximity to superconductors may provoke
localized bound states within the superconducting energy gap known as
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state, which is a promising candidate for constructing
Majorana zero modes and topological qubits. Side-coupled double quantum dot
systems are ideal platforms revealing the secondary proximity effect. Numerical
renormalization group calculations show that, if the central quantum dot can be
treated as a noninteracting resonant level, it acts as a superconducting medium
due to the ordinary proximity effect. The bound state in the side dot behaves
as the case of a single impurity connected to two superconducting leads. The
side dot undergoes quantum phase transitions between a singlet state and a
doublet state as the Coulomb repulsion, the interdot coupling strength, or the
energy level sweeps. Phase diagrams indicate that the phase boundaries could be
well illustrated by $\Delta \approx c {T_{K2}}$ in all cases, with $\Delta$ is
the superconducting gap, $T_{K2}$ is the side Kondo temperature and $c$ is of
the order $1.0$. These findings offer valuable insights into the secondary
proximity effect, and show great importance for designing superconducting
quantum devices.

A Bilayer of semiconducting 2D electronic systems has long been a versatile
platform to study electronic correlation with tunable interlayer tunneling,
Coulomb interactions and layer imbalance. In the natural graphite bilayer,
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), the Landau level gives rise to an
intimate connection between the valley and layer. Adding a moire superlattice
potential enriches the BBG physics with the formation of topological minibands,
potentially leading to tunable exotic quantum transports. Here, we present
magnetotransport measurements of a high-quality bilayer graphene-hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure. The zero-degree alignment generates a
strong moire superlattice potential for the electrons in BBG and the resulting
Landau fan diagram of longitudinal and Hall resistance displays a Hofstadter
butterfly pattern with an unprecedented level of detail. We demonstrate that
the intricate relationship between valley and layer degrees of freedom controls
the topology of moire-induced bands, significantly influencing the energetics
of interacting quantum phases in the BBG superlattice. We further observe
signatures of field-induced correlated insulators and clear fractional
quantizations of interaction driven topological quantum phases, such as
fractional Chern insulators. Our results highlight the BBG/hBN heterostructure
as an ideal platform for studying the delicate interplay between topology and
electron correlation.

Reconstructive phase transitions (RPTs) characterized by breaking and
reconstructing of primary chemical bonds are ubiquitous and fundamentally
important for many technological applications. In contrast to the displacive
phase transition, the dynamics of the RPTs are usually slow because of the need
to overcome a large free-energy barrier. Nevertheless, the RPT from the
low-temperature $\beta$-Ti$_3$O$_5$ phase to the high-temperature
$\lambda$-Ti$_3$O$_5$ phase observed in recent experiments exhibits anomalously
ultrafast and reversible behavior. Despite extensive studies, the underlying
microscopic transition mechanism remains unclear, owing to great challenges in
both experimental measurements and theoretical modeling. Here, we discover a
novel kinetically favorable in-plane nucleated layer-by-layer transformation
mechanism through metadynamics and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
This is enabled by developing an efficient machine learning potential with near
first-principles accuracy through an on-the-fly active learning procedure and
state-of-the-art advanced sampling techniques. Our results unequivocally reveal
that the $\beta$-$\lambda$ phase transformation initiates with the formation of
two-dimensional nuclei in the $ab$-plane due to favorable intra-cell atomic
movements. Subsequently, the transformation proceeds layer-by-layer through a
multistep barrier-lowering kinetic process via intermediate crystalline
metastable phases consisting of $\beta$-like and $\lambda$-like structural
motifs. Our work not only provides important insight into the ultrafast and
reversible nature of the $\beta$-$\lambda$ transition, but also presents useful
strategies and methods for tackling other complex structural phase transitions.

Neural network architectures have been increasingly used to represent quantum
many-body wave functions. In this context, a large number of parameters is
necessary, causing a crisis in traditional optimization methods. The Stochastic
Reconfiguration (SR) approach has been widely used in the past for cases with a
limited number of parameters $P$, since it involves the inversion of a $P
\times P$ matrix and becomes computationally infeasible when $P$ exceeds a few
thousands. This is the major limitation in the context of deep learning, where
the number of parameters significantly surpasses the number of samples $M$ used
for stochastic estimates ($P \gg M$). Here, we show that SR can be applied
exactly by leveraging a simple linear algebra identity to reduce the problem to
the inversion of a manageable $M \times M$ matrix. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method by optimizing a Deep Transformer architecture
featuring approximately 300,000 parameters without any assumption on the sign
structure of the ground state. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
ground-state energy on the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model in the challenging
point $J_2/J_1=0.5$ on the $10\times10$ square lattice, a demanding benchmark
problem in the field of highly-frustrated magnetism. This work marks a
significant step forward in the scalability and efficiency of SR for Neural
Network Quantum States (NNQS), making them a promising method to investigate
unknown phases of matter of quantum systems, where other methods struggle.

Bogoliubov quasiparticles play a crucial role in understanding the behavior
of a superconductor at the nanoscale, particularly in a vortex lattice where
they are thought to be confined to the vortex cores. Here, we use scanning
tunneling noise microscopy, which can locally quantify quasiparticles by
measuring the effective charge, to observe and image delocalized quasiparticles
around vortices in NbSe$_2$ for the first time. Our data reveals a strong
spatial variation of the quasiparticle concentration when tunneling into the
vortex state. We find that quasiparticle poisoning dominates when vortices are
less than four times the coherence length apart. Our results set a new length
scale for quasiparticle poisoning in vortex-based Majorana qubits and yield
information on the effect of vortices in quantum circuits. Finally, we can
describe our findings within the Ginzburg-Landau framework, but the microscopic
origin of the far-extending quasiparticles is yet to be understood.

In this study, we investigate the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of
nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC) samples synthesized under confinement
conditions within porous templates. Using this method, we obtained
de-agglomerated nanoparticles, which provide us with the feasibility of
applying them in nanoparticle films that can be tailored to intricate
geometries. We specifically explored the impact of pore size of the template on
key parameters including saturation magnetization (MS), Curie temperature (TC),
maximum entropy change ({\Delta}S), and relative cooling power (RCP). Our
findings reveal enhancements in those quantities, that are likely to be related
with the nanostructure of the samples, indicating the potential of
nanostructured LSC as an active material for magnetic refrigeration devices.
Our alternative approach of synthesizing magnetocaloric materials under
confinement conditions presents an exciting prospect for future research and
development in the field.

The freshwater crisis is a growing concern and a pressing problem for the
world because of the increasing population, civilization, and rapid industrial
growth. The water treatment facilities are able to supply less than 1% of the
total water demand. Water desalination can be a potential solution to deal with
this alarming issue. Researchers have been exploring for quite some time to
find novel nano-enhanced membranes and manufacturing techniques to increase the
efficiency of the desalination process. Graphene and graphene modified
membranes showed huge potential as desalination membranes for comparatively
easier synthesis process and higher ion rejection rate than conventional filter
materials. Currently, single-layer Mos$_2$ has been discovered to have the same
potential of water permeability and ion rejection rate as graphene membrane in
a more energy-efficient way. For almost analogous nano porous structure of the
graphene membrane, almost 70% of the higher water flux is obtained from the
Mos$_2$ membrane. In this work, it has been shown that nano porous Mos$_2$
membranes provide a promising result for desalinating other salts of seawater
alongside NaCl. We have also observed the effect of variations in ions, pore
size, and pressure on water permeation and ion rejection rates in the water
desalination process. In this study, water permeation increased significantly
by increasing the pore area from 20{\AA} to 80{\AA}. The rate of water
filtration increases in proportion to both applied pressure and pore size,
sacrificing the ion rejection rate for the type of ions studied. A combination
of salt ions in the saline water for desalination has also been studied, where
the rejection rates for the different ions are separately represented for
various applied pressures. For seawater, the Mos$_2$ membrane has showed quite
promising performance in the study of ion variation.

In this work, I derive the time-dependent probability density function of
classical observables using the Hamiltonian mechanics approach, extending the
notion of fluctuation theorems for any observables. In particular, the
time-dependent probability density function of the thermodynamic work evolving
in the switching time is solved as a special case. From such a relation, I
prove Jarzynski's equality and Crook's fluctuation theorem. The particular case
of a Gaussian distribution for slowly-varying processes is derived as well. In
the end, I derive the general form of the work probability distribution for any
switching time, corroborating the result for known results in quadratic
potentials and linear response theory.

<h3>Stability of fractional Chern insulators with a non-Landau level  continuum limit</h3>

<br>
<br>
The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be
predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels.
We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing
the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not
have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of
Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship
between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and
many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement
gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for
Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as
conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to
converge for these configurations.

<h3>Hierarchical meta-modelling of stone injected with CNT/cement mortar</h3>

This paper presents an innovative hierarchical meta-modelling approach for
predicting the effective elastic properties of stone injected with composite
cement grouts containing Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) for structural rehabilitation
purposes. The study first addresses the homogenization of the nano- and
micro-scales through numerical representative volume elements. The first
numerical model focuses on the cement matrix doped with randomly oriented CNTs,
while the second model represents the porous stone with CNT/cement grout
filling the pores. However, the computational burden associated with these
models poses a significant limitation when analysing large-scale
macrostructural elements. To overcome this challenge, a hierarchical
meta-modelling approach based on two nested Kriging surrogate models is
proposed. This approach offers a fast and accurate alternative to bypass the
time-consuming numerical homogenization process. The first surrogate model
establishes a connection between the microstructural characteristics of the
CNTs and cement and the effective elastic properties of the composite grout.
Subsequently, a second meta-model expands over the first one by introducing two
additional variables: the elastic modulus of the stone and the porosity,
allowing for estimation of the overall elastic properties of CNT/cement/stone
composites. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed hierarchical meta-model
is demonstrated through detailed parametric analyses. To showcase its potential
for optimizing rehabilitation interventions, the paper is closed with its
application to a benchmark case study of a stone column injected with
CNT/cement grout.

We report on time-resolved nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy of a strongly
correlated ruthenate, CaRuO$_3$, as a function of temperature, frequency and
terahertz field strength. Third-harmonic radiation for frequencies up to 2.1
THz is observed evidently at low temperatures below 80 K, where the
low-frequency linear dynamical response deviates from the Drude model and a
coherent heavy quasiparticle band emerges by strong correlations associated
with the Hund's coupling.Phenomenologically, by taking an experimentally
observed frequency-dependent scattering rate, the deviation of the field driven
kinetics from the Drude behavior is reconciled in a time-dependent Boltzmann
description, which allows an attribution of the observed third-harmonic
generation to the terahertz field driven nonlinear kinetics of the heavy
quasiparticles.

A generalized symmetry (defined by the algebra of local symmetric operators)
can go beyond group or higher group description. A theory of generalized
symmetry (up to holo-equivalence) was developed in terms of symmetry-TO -- a
bosonic topological order (TO) with gappable boundary in one higher dimension.
We propose a general method to compute the 2+1D symmetry-TO from the local
symmetric operators in 1+1D systems. Our theory is based on the commutant patch
operators, which are extended operators constructed as products and sums of
local symmetric operators. A commutant patch operator commutes with all local
symmetric operators away from its boundary. We argue that topological
invariants associated with anyon diagrams in 2+1D can be computed as contracted
products of commutant patch operators in 1+1D. In particular, we give concrete
formulae for several topological invariants in terms of commutant patch
operators. Topological invariants computed from patch operators include those
beyond modular data, such as the link invariants associated with the Borromean
rings and the Whitehead link. These results suggest that the algebra of
commutant patch operators is described by 2+1D symmetry-TO. Based on our
analysis, we also argue briefly that the commutant patch operators would serve
as order parameters for gapped phases with finite symmetries.

Oil reservoirs around the globe are at their declining phase and in spite of
enormous effectiveness of Enhanced Oil Recovery(EOR) in the Tertiary Stage.
This process still bypasses some oil reason being surface forces responsible
for holding oil inside the rock surface which are not being altered by the
application of existing technologies. The processes coming under Tertiary
Section Supplements primary and secondary sections. However, the mechanism of
operating is different in both. Nanoparticles are showing a significant role in
EOR techniques and is a promising approach to increase crude oil extraction.
This is due to the fact that size of nanoparticles used for EOR lies in the
range of 1-100 nm. It is also an interesting fact that in different operational
conditions and parameters, the performance of nanoparticles also vary and some
are more effective than others, which leads to various levels of recovery in
the EOR process. In the present study, we intend to summarize a report having
an up to date status on nanotechnology assisted EOR mechanisms where
nanoparticles are used as nano-catalysts, nano-emulsions and nanoparticles
assisted EOR mechanisms to destabilize the oil layer on carbonate surface. This
review also highlights the various mechanisms such Gibb's free energy,
wettability alteration, and Interfacial Tension Reduction (ITR) including
interaction of available nanoparticles with reservoirs. Experimental
measurements for a wide range of nanoparticles are not only expensive but are
challenging because of the relatively small size, especially for the
measurements of thinner capillaries of a nanoscale diameter. Therefore, we
considered computational simulations as a more adequate approach to gain more
microscopic insights into the oil displacement process to classify the
suitability of nanomaterials.

The shallow donor in zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising semiconductor spin qubit
with optical access. Single indium donors are isolated in a commercial ZnO
substrate using plasma focused-ion beam (PFIB) milling. Quantum emitters are
identified optically by spatial and frequency filtering. The indium donor
assignment is based on the optical bound exciton transition energy and magnetic
dependence. The single donor emission is intensity and frequency stable with a
transition linewidth less than twice the lifetime limit. The isolation of
optically stable single donors post-FIB fabrication is promising for optical
device integration required for scalable quantum technologies based on single

The height at which the liquid floats is determined by a dimensionless

The interface between NiCr alloys and FLiNaK molten salt exhibits complex
corrosion behavior, mainly driven by intricate chemical interactions involving
Cr and F$\mathrm{^-}$ ions. Understanding these dynamic reactions is crucial
for developing effective corrosion mitigation strategies to ensure the
long-term durability of Ni-based alloy components in molten salt technologies.
However, obtaining molecular-level understanding through experiments is
challenging. To address this, we utilize reactive molecular dynamics
simulations enabled by a reactive force field, ReaxFF, to investigate detailed
reaction dynamics at the atomic level. Since there is currently no available
force field involving fluoride salt and Ni-based alloys, we first present the
development of the ReaxFF parameter set for Ni/Cr/F/Li/Na/K based on extensive
first-principles calculations. With this force field, we achieve a strong
agreement for the structure of FLiNaK molten salt by comparing the pair
distribution functions with experimental and simulation results. Furthermore,
it successfully reproduces the experimental phenomenon of Cr dissolution in
fluoride salt, with the corrosion rate depending on the alloy and salt
compositions. Particularly, it reveals that increasing the concentration of Li
can enhance the formation of a compact double layer, mitigating Cr dissolution.
This work enables a fundamental understanding of the interfacial behavior
between fluoride salt and NiCr alloys.

We analytically discuss and micromagnetically prove the ways to tune the
spatial asymmetry of the initial phase, amplitude, and wavevectors of
magnetostatic waves driven by ultrafast laser excitation. We consider that the
optical pulse heats a thin ferromagnetic metallic film and abruptly decreases
the saturation magnetization and the parameter of uniaxial anisotropy. The two
corresponding terms of laser-induced torque have different azimuthal
symmetries, with the 4-fold symmetry of the demagnetization-related term, and
the isotropic distribution of the anisotropy-related term. As a result, the
initial phase and amplitude of excited magnetostatic waves have a non-trivial
azimuthal distribution tunable with the angle between the external magnetic
field and anisotropy axis, and the laser spot diameter. Moreover, the variation
of these parameters tunes the distribution of wavevectors, resulting in
additional asymmetry between the spectral components of the waves propagating
in different directions.

The possibility of selecting magnetic space groups by orienting the
magnetization direction or tuning magnetic orders offers a vast playground for
engineering symmetry protected topological phases in magnetic materials. In
this work, we study how selective tuning of symmetry and magnetism can
influence and control the resulting topology in a 2D magnetic system, and
illustrate such procedure in the ferromagnetic monolayer MnPSe$_3$. Density
functional theory calculations reveals a symmetry-protected accidental
semimetalic (SM) phase for out-of-plane magnetization which becomes an
insulator when the magnetization is tilted in-plane, reaching band gap values
close to $100$ meV. We identify an order-two composite antiunitary symmetry and
threefold rotational symmetry that induce the band crossing and classify the
possible topological phases using symmetry analysis, which we support with
tight-binding and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ models. Breaking of inversion
symmetry opens a gap in the SM phase, giving rise to a Chern insulator. We
demonstrate this explicitly in the isostructural Janus compound
Mn$_2$P$_2$S$_3$Se$_3$, which naturally exhibits Rashba spin-orbit coupling
that breaks inversion symmetry. Our results map out the phase space of
topological properties of ferromagnetic transition metal phosphorus
trichalcogenides and demonstrate the potential of the magnetization-dependent
metal-to-insulator transition as a spin switch in integrated two-dimensional
electronics.

Hole spins in Ge/SiGe heterostructure quantum dots have emerged as promising
qubits for quantum computation. The strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
characteristic of heavy-hole states in Ge, enables fast and all-electrical
qubit control. However, SOC also increases the susceptibility of spin qubits to
charge noise. While qubit coherence can be significantly improved by operating
at sweet spots with reduced hyperfine or charge noise sensitivity, the latter
ultimately limits coherence, underlining the importance of understanding and
reducing charge noise at its source. In this work, we study the voltage-induced
hysteresis commonly observed in SiGe-based quantum devices and show that the
dominant charge fluctuators are localized at the semiconductor-oxide interface.
By applying increasingly negative gate voltages to Hall bar and quantum dot
devices, we investigate how the hysteretic filling of interface traps impacts
transport metrics and charge noise. We find that the gate-induced accumulation
and trapping of charge at the SiGe-oxide interface leads to an increased
electrostatic disorder, as probed by transport measurements, as well as the
activation of low-frequency relaxation dynamics, resulting in slow drifts and
increased charge noise levels. Our results highlight the importance of a
conservative device tuning strategy and reveal the critical role of the
semiconductor-oxide interface in SiGe heterostructures for spin qubit
applications.

It is well-known that macroscopically-normalizable zero-energy wavefunctions
of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous magnetic
field are spin-polarized and exactly calculable with degeneracy equaling the
number of flux quanta linking the whole system. Extending this argument to
massless Dirac fermions subjected to magnetic fields that have \textit{zero}
net flux but are doubly periodic in real space, we show that there exist
\textit{only two} Bloch-normalizable zero-energy eigenstates, one for each spin
flavor. This result is immediately relevant to graphene multilayer systems
subjected to doubly-periodic strain fields, which at low energies, enter the
Hamiltonian as periodic pseudo-gauge vector potentials. Furthermore, we explore
various related settings including nonlinearly-dispersing band structure models
and systems with singly-periodic magnetic fields.
