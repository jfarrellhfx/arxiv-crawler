<h3>How advection stabilize long-range order in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01603</a>
<br>
<i>Harukuni Ikeda</i>
<p>In this work, we discuss how the linear and non-linear advection terms
stabilize the long-range order in $d=2$ dimension, which is prohibited by the
Mermin-Wagner theorem in equilibrium. For an example of the liner advection, we
consider the $O(n)$ model in the steady shear. Our scaling analysis reveals
that the model can undergo the continuous symmetry breaking even in $d=2$ and,
moreover, predicts the upper critical dimension $d_{\rm up}=2$. These results
are fully consistent with a recent numerical simulation of the $O(2)$ model,
where the authors reported a continuous symmetry breaking characterized by the
mean-field critical exponents in $d=2$. For an example of the non-linear
advection, we consider Toner and Tu model, which was introduced to explain the
polar-ordered flocks observed, for instance, in the Vicsek model in $d=2$. Our
simple scaling argument reproduces the previous results by the dynamical
renormalization theory. We furthermore discuss the effects of the additional
non-linear terms discovered by the recent re-analysis of the hydrodynamic
equation of the polar-ordered flocks. Our scaling argument predicts that the
additional non-linear terms modify the scaling exponents and, in particular,
recover the isotropic scaling behavior reported in the previous numerical
simulation of the Vicsek model.

<h3>Proposal for many-body quantum chaos detection</h3>

<p>In this work, we use the term ``quantum chaos'' to refer to spectral
correlations similar to those found in random matrix theory. Quantum chaos can
be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using the spectral form
factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The
spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point
spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau
structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how
this structure could be detected through the dynamics of two physical
quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival
probability and the spin autocorrelation function. When the system is small,
the dip reaches values that are large enough at times which are short enough to
be detected with current experimental platforms and commercially available
quantum computers.

<h3>Topological Phase Transition without Single-Particle-Gap Closing in  Strongly Correlated Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01402</a>
<br>
<i>Peizhi Mai, Jinchao Zhao, Thomas A. Maier, Barry Bradlyn, Philip W. Phillips</i>
<p>We show here that numerous examples abound where changing topology does not
necessarily close the bulk insulating charge gap as demanded in the standard
non-interacting picture. From extensive determinantal and dynamical cluster
quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the half-filled and quarter-filled
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we show that for sufficiently strong interactions at
either half- or quarter-filling, a transition between topological and trivial
insulators occurs without the closing of a charge gap. To shed light on this
behavior, we illustrate that an exactly solvable model reveals that while the
single-particle gap remains, the many-body gap does in fact close. These two
gaps are the same in the non-interacting system but depart from each other as
the interaction turns on. We purport that for interacting systems, the proper
probe of topological phase transitions is the closing of the many-body rather
than the single-particle gap.

<h3>Influence of Surface Roughness on Linear Behavior and Mechanical  Properties of Three Cyanoacrylate-Based Adhesives Used to Bond Strain Gages</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01406" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01406</a>
<br>
<i>L. G. Simao, W. P. Jesus, M. E. A. Ribeiro, H. C. Rangel, R. J. S. Rodriguez, E. A. Carvalho</i>
<p>The challenge of accessing specialized adhesives designed for strain gage
applications has been highlighted due to failures in logistic chains, requiring
the exploration of local alternatives. A direct simulation of strain gage
bonding behavior with two steel plates is infeasible due to the unique
construction of strain gages. Therefore, an indirect simulation method,
comparing local alternatives to a widely accepted adhesive, Loctite 496, was
employed in this study. Two potential replacements, Loctite 401 and Tekbond
793, were tested and matched against the benchmark adhesive, with a focus on
the key mechanical properties: Proportional Shear Strain (PSS), Proportional
Shear Stress (PSSt), and Apparent Shear Modulus (G*). Loctite 401 exhibited the
highest G*, suggesting its potential use in strain gage installations if G* is
considered most important. However, Tekbond 793 demonstrated superior PSS,
Maximum Shear Stress (MSSt), and Rupture Shear Stress (RSSt) performance,
displaying linear behavior even without an accelerator. Surface preparation
considerations were also discussed, noting that hand abrading results in double
the surface roughness than using an orbital sander. The study further
identified two main regions concerning failure modes related to Ra, with values
below 0.31 {\mu}m causing significant variations in observed mechanical
properties, pointing towards factors beyond adhesive layer thickness affecting
bond properties. Lastly, the general recommendation is the use of an
accelerator for all tested adhesives, while the use of a surface conditioner
and neutralizer was found to negatively impact adhesive performance.

<h3>Generic magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity in effective  spin-1/2 magnetic insulators via hybridization of acoustic phonons and  spin-flip excitations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01407" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01407</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher A. Pocs, Jie Xing, Eun Sang Choi, Athena S. Sefat, Michael Hermele, Minhyea Lee</i>
<p>It is common to observe a notable non-monotonic dependence of thermal
conductivity on applied magnetic field in magnetic insulators. This prevalent
behavior prompts the need for an explanation involving components present in a
wide range of systems. We report the field-dependence of thermal conductivity
in the well-characterized effective spin-1/2 paramagnetic insulator CsYbSe$_2$.
Along with the data, we propose that the observed non-monotonic field
dependence results from the hybridization of acoustic phonons with spin-flip
excitations across the Zeeman gap, where the magnetoelastic coupling arises via
modulation of the magnetic $g$-tensor by local strain. This hypothesis aligns
with a simple theoretical model that qualitatively reproduces key features of
the data on CsYbSe$_2$. Our results provide a starting point to understand the
magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity in a broad spectrum of
magnetic insulators.

<h3>Evolution of the pseudogap temperature dependence in  YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ films under the influence of a magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01413</a>

<i>E. V. Petrenko, A. V. Terekhov, L. V. Bludova, Yu. A. Kolesnichenko, N. V. Shytov, D. M. Sergeyev, E. Lähderanta, K. Rogacki, A. L. Solovjov</i>
<p>The evolution of the temperature dependence of pseudogap $\Delta$*(T) in
optimally doped (OD) YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) films with $T_{c}$ =
88.7 K under the influence of a magnetic field $B$ up to 8 T has been studied
in detail. It has been established that the shape of $\Delta$*(T) for various
$B$ over the entire range from the pseudogap opening temperature $T$* to
$T_{01}$, below which superconducting fluctuations occur, has a wide maximum at
the BEC-BCS crossover temperature $T_{pair}$, which is typical for OD films and
untwinned YBCO single crystals. $T$* was shown to be independent on $B$,
whereas $T_{pair}$ shifts to the low temperature region along with increase of
$B$, while the maximum value of $\Delta$*($T_{pair}$) remains practically
constant regardless of $B$. It was revealed that as the field increases, the
low-temperature maximum near the 3D-2D transition temperature $T_{0}$ is
blurred and disappears at $B$ > 5 T. Moreover, above the Ginzburg temperature
$T_{G}$, which limits superconducting fluctuations from below, at $B$ > 0.5 T,
a minimum appears on $\Delta$*(T) at $T_{min}$, which becomes very pronounced
with a further increase in the field. As a result, the overall value of
$\Delta$*(T) decreases noticeably most likely due to pair-breaking affect of a
magnetic field. A comparison of $\Delta$*(T) near $T_{c}$ with the Peters-Bauer
theory shows that the density of fluctuating Cooper pairs actually decreases
from <<n$_{\uparrow}$n$_{\downarrow}$>> $\approx$ 0.31 at $B$ = 0 to
<<n$_{\uparrow}$n$_{\downarrow}$>> $\approx$ 0.28 in the field 8 T. The
observed behavior of $\Delta$*(T) around $T_{min}$ is assumed to be due to the
influence of a two-dimensional vortex lattice created by the magnetic field,
which prevents the formation of fluctuating Cooper pairs near $T_{c}$.

<h3>High entropy ceramics for applications in extreme environments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01418" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01418</a>

<i>T.Z. Ward, R.P. Wilkerson, B.L. Musico, A. Foley, M. Brahlek, W.J. Weber, K.E. Sickafus, A.R. Mazza</i>
<p>Compositionally complex materials have demonstrated extraordinary promise for
structural robustness in extreme environments. Of these, the most commonly
thought of are high entropy alloys, where chemical complexity grants uncommon
combinations of hardness, ductility, and thermal resilience. In contrast to
these metal-metal bonded systems, the addition of ionic and covalent bonding
has led to the discovery of high entropy ceramics. These materials also possess
outstanding structural, thermal, and chemical robustness but with a far greater
variety of functional properties which enable access to continuously
controllable magnetic, electronic, and optical phenomena. In this perspective,
we outline the potential for high entropy ceramics in functional applications
under extreme environments, where intrinsic stability may provide a new path
toward inherently hardened device design. Current works on high entropy
carbides, actinide bearing ceramics, and high entropy oxides are reviewed in
the areas of radiation, high temperature, and corrosion tolerance where the
role of local disorder is shown to create pathways toward self-healing and
structural robustness. In this context, new strategies for creating future
electronic, magnetic, and optical devices to be operated in harsh environments
are outlined.

<h3>A study of the magnetocaloric behavior of Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$  compounds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01431" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01431</a>
<br>
<i>H. Chouaibi, S. Mansouri, S. Aitjmal, M. Balli, O. Chdil, M. Abbasi Eskandari, S. H. Bukhari, P. Fournier</i>
<p>In this paper, we report on the magnetic and magnetocaloric features of
Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ (Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$Mn$_2$O$_5$) with $x=$ 0.6, 0.8,
and 1 series elaborated by sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction and Raman
measurements attest well the high quality of our polycrystalline samples that
crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with the Pbam space group. The Raman
phonon frequencies were carried out and compared with the lattice dynamics
calculations to identify the vibrational properties of all detected modes at
room temperature. As expected, our magnetic study reveals that the
magnetization was enhanced by the substitution of Y$^{3+}$ by Dy$^{3+}$. The
Dy-substituted YMn$_2$O$_5$ sets the N\'eel transition [TN (Mn)] in the
temperature range going from 40 to 45 K favoring the emergence of a transition
at a very low temperature due to the long-range ordering of the Dy3+ magnetic
moments below 13K [TN (Dy)]. Dual peaks in the magnetic entropy change curve
are also observed being in good agreement with magnetization data, which
enlarges the range of application of these materials. On the other hand, a
large magnetocaloric effect is observed close to 13 K which is mainly due the
ordering of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic moments. Also, the incommensurate
antiferromagnetic transition of Mn magnetic moment taking place around 40 K
affects slightly the entropy change. Our refrigerant capacity (RC) findings are
higher compared to the average of RC for a, b, c axis of single crystal samples
as HoMn$_2$O$_5$ and TbMn$_2$O$_5$, which confirms that our polycrystalline
materials stand for promising magnetic refrigerant candidates that can be
invested in space technology, hydrogen and helium liquefaction at cryogenic
temperature.

<h3>Operando Plasma-XPS for Process Monitoring: Hydrogenation of Copper  Oxide Confined Under h-BN Case Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01434" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01434</a>
<br>

<p>We demonstrate that ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS)
can be used for in situ studies of dynamic changes in surface chemistry in a
plasma environment. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was used in this study as a
model system since it exhibits a wide array of unique chemical, optical, and
electrical properties that make it a prospective material for advanced
electronics. To better understand the stability and surface chemistry of h-BN
during plasma-assisted processing, we used polycrystalline Cu foils with
single-layer h-BN, grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and tracked in
real-time the plasma-induced reduction of the underlying Cu oxide using APXPS
equipped with 22 kHz 75 W discharge plasma source operating at 13 Pa. Residual
gas analysis (RGA) mass-spectra were concurrently collected during plasma-XPS
to track reaction products formed during plasma exposure. A clear reduction of
CuxO is seen, while an h-BN layer remains intact, suggesting H radical species
can attack the exposed and h-BN-covered Cu oxide patches and partially reduce
the underlying substrate. In addition to the demonstration and discussion of
plasma-XPS capabilities, our results indicate the h-BN encapsulated metallic Cu
interface might be repaired without significantly damaging the overlaying h-BN,
which is of practical importance for the development of h-BN encapsulated
devices and interfaces

<h3>Systematic incorporation of the ionic hard-core size into the  Debye-Huckel theory via the cumulant expansion of the Schwinger-Dyson  equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01464" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01464</a>
<br>
<i>Sahin Buyukdagli</i>
<p>The Debye-Huckel (DH) formalism of bulk electrolytes equivalent to the
gaussian-level closure of the electrostatic Schwinger-Dyson identities without
the interionic hard-core (HC) coupling is extended via the cumulant treatment
of these equations augmented by HC interactions. By confronting the monovalent
ion activity and pressure predictions of our cumulant-corrected DH (CCDH)
theory with hypernetted-chain results and Monte-Carlo simulations from the
literature, we show that this rectification extends the accuracy of the DH
formalism from submolar into molar salt concentrations. In the case of internal
energies or the general case of divalent electrolytes mainly governed by charge
correlations, the improved accuracy of the CCDH theory is limited to submolar
ion concentrations. Comparison with experimental data from the literature shows
that via the adjustment of the hydrated ion radii, the CCDH formalism can
equally reproduce the non-uniform effect of salt increment on the ionic
activity coefficients up to molar concentrations. The inequality satisfied by
these HC sizes coincides with the cationic branch of the Hofmeister series.

<i>Benjamin A. Foutty, Vladimir Calvera, Zhaoyu Han, Carlos R. Kometter, Song Liu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, James C. Hone, Steven A. Kivelson, Benjamin E. Feldman</i>
<p>First-order phase transitions produce abrupt changes to the character of both
ground and excited electronic states. Here we conduct electronic
compressibility measurements to map the spin phase diagram and Landau level
(LL) energies of monolayer WSe$_2$ in a magnetic field. We resolve a sequence
of first-order phase transitions between completely spin-polarized LLs and
states with LLs of both spins. Unexpectedly, the LL gaps are roughly constant
over a wide range of magnetic fields below the transitions, which we show
reflects a preference for opposite spin excitations of the spin-polarized
ground state. These transitions also extend into compressible regimes, with a
sawtooth boundary between full and partial spin polarization. We link these
observations to the important influence of LL filling on the exchange energy
beyond a smooth density-dependent contribution. Our results show that WSe$_2$
realizes a unique hierarchy of energy scales where such effects induce
re-entrant magnetic phase transitions tuned by density and magnetic field.

<h3>Hole-doping structural titration and manipulation of correlated charge  density wave state in 1T-TaS2</h3>

<i>Haoyu Dong, Yanyan Geng, Jianfeng Guo, Le Lei, Manyu Wang, Yan Li, Li Huang, Fei Pang, Rui Xu, Wei Ji, Hong-Jun Gao, Weichang Zhou, Zhihai Cheng</i>
<p>The complex correlated charge density wave (CDW) phases of 1T-TaS2 have
attracted a lot of interest due to their emergent quantum states, such as
intricate CDW phase, Mott-Hubbard state, superconductivity and quantum spin
liquid state. The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer
electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental
perquisite for these exotic quantum states. Here, we report a real-space
titration-like investigation of correlated CDW state in 1T-TaS2 upon
hole-doping via variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (VT-STM).
The sequential increased hole-doping result in the emergence of electron voids,
phase domains, stacking disordering and mixed phase/chiral domains due to the
gradual weaken electron correlations. The detailed configurations and dynamic
behaviors of these features as well as novel ring-Star-of-David (SoD) clusters
and stripe-like nematic CDW state are further investigated and discussed based
on the complex structural-sensitive interactions. The local reversible
disordering-ordering CDW manipulation is further realized by the transient
charge-injections via the field-emission bias-pulses. Our results provide an
in-depth insight of this delicate correlated CDW states, and pave a way to
realize exotic quantum states via the accurate tuning of interior interactions
in correlated materials.

<h3>Wave-Particle Duality of Ultrasound: Acoustic Softening Explained by  Particle Treatment of Ultrasonic Wave</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01513" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01513</a>
<br>
<i>Libin Yang, Lixiang Yang</i>
<p>When ultrasonic wave is irradiated on materials, a small static stress is
required to get materials yielding and flowing. This is called acoustic
softening effect, also known as Blaha effect for a long time. In the past, this
effect was explained by several continuum scale or meso-scale solid mechanics
theories such as stress superposition or energy superposition theory, or
crystal/dislocation plasticity. Due to a lot of microscopic complexities
happening inside the materials during ultrasonic vibration, fully understanding
of acoustic softening effect is not easy. In this paper, traditional solid
mechanics theory is expanded by introducing several concepts in semi-conductor
physics. Four new aspects were introduced to understand acoustic softening
effect. Firstly, contrary to most existed work in acoustic softening research
area which treats ultrasound as waves, it was treated as particles. Secondly,
crystal/dislocation plastic theory was simplified to a single equation.
Thirdly, concepts of photoelectric effect or photo-voltaic effect were
introduced. Analogy of electron movement due to light wave and defect movement
due to ultrasonic wave was illustrated. Particularly, as light wave is treated
as photon, ultrasonic wave is treated as phonon in this paper. Fourthly,
defects such as point defects or line defects are assumed to have certain
bonding energy. Their bonding energies are assumed to be quantized or
discontinuous. The band gap theory used in photo-voltaic theory is embraced to
understand defects movements in solid mechanics due to ultrasonic phonon.

<h3>Two-dimensional polarized superfluids under the prism of the fermion  sign problem</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01547" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01547</a>
<br>
<i>Tiancheng Yi, Song Cheng, Ian Pilé, Evgeni Burovski, Rubem Mondaini</i>
<p>Understanding if attractive fermions in an unbalanced occupation of its
flavors can give rise to a superfluid state in two dimensions (2D), realizing
the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, presents a long-standing
question. A limitation on its solution by numerics is posed by the sign
problem, which constrains the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo techniques
at sufficiently low temperatures and large lattice sizes, where a potential
signature of polarized superfluidity would be unambiguous. By using a recently
explored argument that the sign problem may be used instead to infer quantum
critical behavior, we explore the regime where partial polarization occurs in
the phase diagram, further showing that the average sign $\langle {\cal
S}\rangle$ of quantum Monte Carlo weights tracks the criticality between
balanced (or fully polarized) and polarized phases. Using the attractive
Hubbard model with an unbalanced population, our investigation expands the
scope of problems in which $\langle {\cal S}\rangle$ can be used for monitoring
critical behavior, providing compelling albeit indirect evidence for the
robustness of an FFLO phase in 2D.

<h3>Confined run and tumble particles with non-Markovian tumbling statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01576" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01576</a>
<br>
<i>Oded Farago, Naftali R. Smith</i>
<p>Confined active particles constitute simple, yet realistic, examples of
systems that converge into a non-equilibrium steady state. We investigate a
run-and-tumble particle in one spatial dimension, trapped by an external
potential, with a given distribution $g(t)$ of waiting times between tumbling
events whose mean value is equal to $\tau$. Unless $g(t)$ is an exponential
distribution (corresponding to a constant tumbling rate), the process is
non-Markovian, which makes the analysis of the model particularly challenging.
We use an analytical framework involving effective position-dependent tumbling
rates, to develop a numerical method that yields the full steady-state
distribution (SSD). The method is very efficient and requires modest computing
resources, including in the large-deviations and/or small-$\tau$ regime, where
the SSD can be related to the the large-deviation function, $s(x)$, via the
scaling relation $P_{{\rm
st}}(x)\sim e^{-s\left(x\right)/\tau}$.

<h3>Exotic Topological Phenomena in Chiral Superconducting States on Doped  Quantum Spin Hall Insulators with Honeycomb Lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01602" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01602</a>
<br>
<i>Junkang Huang, Tao Zhou, Z. D. Wang</i>
<p>We have conducted a theoretical investigation of the topological phenomena
associated with chiral superconducting pairing states induced in a doped
Kane-Mele model on a honeycomb lattice. Through numerical analysis, we have
obtained exotic phase diagrams for both the $d+id$ and $p+ip$ superconducting
states. In the case of the $d+id$ pairing state, higher Chern number states
with $\left| C \right| = \pm 4$ emerge. The Chern number decreases as the
spin-orbit coupling is introduced. For the $p+ip$ pairing state, additional
phase transition lines are present in the overdoped region near the Van Hove
singularity point, leading to the emergence of higher Chern number phases with
$\left| C \right| = \pm 6$. These higher Chern number phases are further
verified through the bulk-edge correspondence. To understand the origin of the
exotic topological phase diagrams in the chiral superconducting state, we have
examined the electronic structure at the phase transition lines. This
investigation provides insight into the complex interplay between chiral
superconductivity and topological properties, potentially paving the way for
the discovery of new materials with unique topological properties.

<h3>Quantum Oscillation in Excitonic Insulating Electron-Hole Bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01605</a>
<br>
<i>Yuelin Shao, Xi Dai</i>
<p>We study the quantum oscillations of inter-layer capacitance in an excitonic
insulating electron-hole double layer with the Hartree Fock mean-field theory.
Such oscillations could be simply understood from the physical picture
``exciton formed by electron/hole Landau levels'', where the direct gap between
the electron-hole Landau levels will oscillate with exciton chemical potential
and the inverse of the magnetic field. We also find that the excitonic order
parameters can be destroyed by a strong magnetic field. At this time, the
system becomes two independent quantum Hall liquids and the inter-layer
capacitance oscillates to zero at zero temperature.

<h3>Intrinsic Spin Hall Effect in 5d Metals Calculated from Ab-Initio  Transport Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01658</a>
<br>
<i>Akash Bajaj, Reena Gupta, Ilya V. Tokatly, Stefano Sanvito, Andrea Droghetti</i>
<p>We describe how the spin Hall effect (SHE) can be studied from ab-initio by
combining density functional theory with the non-equilibrium Green's functions
technique for quantum transport into the so-called DFT+NEGF method. After
laying down our theoretical approach in particular discussing how to compute
charge and spin bond currents, DFT+NEGF calculations are carried out for ideal
clean systems. In these the transport is ballistic and the linear response
limit is met. The SHE emerges in a central region attached to two leads when we
apply a bias voltage so that electrons are accelerated by a uniform electric
field. As a result, we obtain a finite spin-Hall current and, by performing a
scaling analysis with respect to the system size, we estimate the ballistic
spin Hall conductivity (SHC). We consider 5d metals with fcc and bcc crystal
structures, finding that the SHC exhibits a rough qualitative dependence on the
d-band filling, and comment on these results in relation to existing
literature. Finally, within the same DFT+NEGF approach, we also predict the
appearance of a current-induced spin dipole moment inside the materials' unit
cell and estimate its magnitude.

<i>Samuel Aldana, Ion Spiridon, Lulin Wang, Hongzhou Zhang</i>
<p>Controlling the morphology of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) plays a key role in their applications. Although
chemical vapor deposition can achieve wafer-scale growth of 2D TMDs, a
comprehensive theoretical framework for effective growth optimization is
lacking. Atomistic modeling methods offer a promising approach to delve into
the intricate dynamics underlying the growth. In this study, we employ kinetic
Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to identify crucial parameters that govern the
morphology of MoS2 flakes grown on diverse substrates. Our simulations reveal
that large adsorption rates significantly enhance growth speed, which however
necessitates rapid edge migration to achieve compact triangles. Substrate
etching can tune the adsorption-desorption process of adatoms and enable
preferential growth within a specific substrate region, controlling the flake
morphology. This study unravels the complex dynamics governing 2D TMD
morphology, offering a theoretical framework for decision-making in the design
and optimization of TMD synthesis processes.

<p>Chiral charge density wave (CDW) is widely observed in low dimensional
systems to be entangled with various emerging phases but its microscopic origin
has been elusive. We reinvestigate the representative but debated chiral CDW of
TiSe$_{2}$ using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. Our STM data reveal unambiguously the chiral
distortion of the topmost Se layer in domains of opposite chirality, which are
interfaced with a novel domain wall. DFT calculations find the atomic structure
of the chiral CDW, which has a $C2$ symmetry with the inversion and reflection
symmetry broken. The chirality is determined by the helicity of Se-Ti bond
distortions and their translation between neighboring layers. The present
structure reproduces well the STM images with lower energy than the prevailing
non-chiral $P\bar{3}c1$ structure model. Our result provides the atomistic
understanding of the CDW chirality in TiSe$_{2}$, which can be referred to in a
wide class of monolayer and layered materials with CDW.

<h3>Tuning Einstein Oscillator Frequencies of Cation Rattlers: A Molecular  Dynamics Study of the Lattice Thermal Conductivity of CsPbBr$_3$</h3>

<i>Jonathan Lahnsteiner, Max Rang, Menno Bokdam</i>
<p>The pure CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite is an archetypal example of a strongly
anharmonic crystal that poses a major challenge for computational methods to
describe its thermodynamic properties. Its lattice dynamics exhibits
characteristics of a phonon liquid: mode coupling, low lifetimes and
`rattlers'. To study the thermal conduction in this crystal, including the
effect of dynamic disorder introduced by the Cs rattlers, we apply large-scale
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with machine-learning interatomic
potentials. We simulate its ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity in the cubic
phase and obtain phonon spectra by measuring velocity autocorrelation
functions. The thermal conductivity at 500 K is computed to be
$0.53\pm0.04\frac{\rm W}{\rm m K}$, which is similar to that of demineralized
water under normal indoor conditions. MD based insight into the heat transport
mechanism of halide perovskites is presented. In the analysis the Cs cations
are interpreted as damped Einstein oscillators. The phonon bandstructure of a
system with artificially raised Cs masses demonstrates an increased
interference of the Cs rattling with the acoustic phonon modes. We show that
the thermal conductivity of the CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite can still be slightly
decreased by tuning the cation rattling frequency into the range of the low
lying acoustic mode

<h3>Exotic magnetization curves in classical square-kagomé spin lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01678</a>
<br>
<i>Heinz-Jürgen Schmidt, Johannes Richter</i>
<p>Classical spin systems with non-coplanar ground states typically exhibit
nonlinear magnetization curves characterized by kinks and jumps. Our article
briefly summarizes the most important related analytical results. In a
comprehensive case study, we then address AF-square kagom\'{e} and AF/FM-square
kagom\'{e} spin lattices equipped with additional cross-plaquette interactions.
It is known that these systems have non-coplanar ground states that assume a
cuboctahedral structure in the absence of a magnetic field. When a magnetic
field $H$ is switched on, a rich variety of different phases develops from the
cuboctahedral ground state, which are studied in their dependence on $H$ and a
cross-plaquette coupling constant $J_3>0$. For the AF square-kagom\'{e} spin
lattice, we carefully identify and describe seven phases that appear in a phase
diagram with five triple points. The transitions between these phases are
predominantly discontinuous, although two cases exhibit continuous transitions.
In contrast, the phase diagram of the AF/FM square-kagom\'{e} model shows only
four phases with a single triple point, but these also lead to exotic
magnetization curves. Here, too, there are two types of phase boundaries
belonging to continuous and discontinuous transitions.

<h3>Conservation, correlations, and diagrammatic completeness</h3>

<br>
<i>Frederick Green</i>
<p>The diagrammatic theory of strongly correlated systems includes two types of
selfconsistent perturbative analysis: Phi derivability, or conserving
approximations, and iterative parquet theory. Becker and Grosser [W. Becker and
D. Grosser, Nuov. Cim. A 10, 343 (1972)] first showed that crossing symmetry
and elastic unitarity (conservation) could not both be satisfied in any
approximation to the two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equation for the transition
matrix. Jackson and Smith [A. D. Jackson and R. A. Smith, Phys. Rev. A 36, 2517
(1987)] later proved in particular that, despite their close affinity, Phi
derivability and parquet are fundamentally irreconcilable. Parquet theory
computes the two-body scattering amplitude, respecting its crossing symmetry.
Phi derivability computes the nonequilibrium one-body dynamics, respecting
conservation in the two-body response. Parquet cannot safeguard conservation
and Phi derivability cannot guarantee crossing symmetry, yet both are physical
requirements. We investigate these ``failure modes'' within a generalized
Hamiltonian approach. The two methods' respective relation to the exact ground
state sheds light on their complementary shortcomings.

<h3>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of 2D Janus Ferromagnetic LaBrI with  Strain-induced Valley Degeneracy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01683</a>

<i>Anuja Kumari, Abhinav Nag, Santanu K. Maiti, Jagdish Kumar</i>
<p>Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the
out-of-plane mirror symmetry of TMDs monolayers, considerable and systematic
research has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically
analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus
material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The
structural optimizations have been carried out using the FP-LAPW (Full
Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave) basis, as implemented in the ELK using
tb-mBJ exchange correlation potential. Computed structural parameters are in
good comparison with literature reports. Further, optimized crystal structures
were used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric
properties using pseudo potential based Quantum espresso code. Dynamical
stability predicts material can withstand strain upto 10% strain. Computed
electronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide bandgap ferromagnetic
material with magnetic moment 1{\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile
strain the band gap increases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric
properties predicts high Seebeck coefficient of ~ 400 {\mu}V/K and low thermal
conductivity of ~ 1.13 X 1014 W/msK in LaBrI which results high ZT of ~ 1.92
with 8% strain at 800 K with p-type doping. Thus, present study supports the
fact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE
properties and making it to be a promising material for TE applications at
higher temperature.

<h3>HEOM-QUICK2: a general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body open  quantum systems -- An Update</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01715</a>
<br>
<i>Daochi Zhang, Lyuzhou Ye, Jiaan Cao, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu, Xiao Zheng, YiJing Yan</i>
<p>Many-body open quantum systems (OQS) have a profound impact on various
subdisciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus, the development of a
computer program capable of accurately, efficiently, and versatilely simulating
many-body OQS is highly desirable. In recent years, we have focused on the
advancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical
equations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach
allows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations,
non-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These
efforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for
QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to
the best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for
fermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program
features more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment
of non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time
dissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2
has become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic
many-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions.
Furthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables
accurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin
relaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through
several examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under
non-equilibrium conditions. Thus, the new HEOM-QUICK2 program offers a powerful
and comprehensive tool for studying many-body OQS with exotic quantum phenomena
and exploring applications in various disciplines.

<h3>Structural dynamics and optimal transport of an active polymer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01719" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01719</a>
<br>
<i>Hamidreza Khalilian, Fernando Peruani, Jalal Sarabadani</i>
<p>We study the spontaneous configuration transitions of an active semi-flexible
polymer between spiral and non-spiral states, and show that the configuration
dynamics is fully described by a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation. Exploiting
the fact that active polymer barely moves in spiral states and exhibits net
displacements in non-spira states, we prove that the motion of the active
polymer is consistent with a run-and-tumble-like dynamics. Moreover, we find
that there exists an optimal self-propelling force, at which the probabilities
of finding the polymer in the spiral and non-spiral state become equal, that
maximizes the diffusion coefficient.

<h3>An accurate reaction-diffusion limit to the spherical-symmetric  Boltzmann equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01726</a>
<br>
<i>Shay I. Heizler, Menahem Krief, Michael Assaf</i>
<p>We resolve a long standing question regarding the suitable effective
diffusion coefficient of the spherically-symmetric transport equation, which is
valid at long times. To that end, we generalize a transport solution in three
dimensions for homogeneous media, to include general collisional properties,
including birth-death events and linearly anisotropic scattering. This is done
by introducing an exact scaling law relating the Green function of the
pure-scattering case with the general collision case, which is verified using
deterministic and Monte-Carlo simulations. Importantly, the effective diffusion
coefficient is identified by inspecting the transport solution at long times.

<h3>Spin-Transfer-Torque Induced Spatially Nonuniform Switching in  Ferrimagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01741" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01741</a>
<br>
<i>Xue Zhang, Zhengde Xu, Jie Ren, Yixiao Qiao, Weijia Fan, Zhifeng Zhu</i>
<p>Ferrimagnet (FiM), (FeCo)1-xGdx, attracts research attention due to its
ultrafast magnetic dynamics and finite net magnetization. Incorporating FiM
into the magnetic tunnel junction will be beneficial to further improve the
writing speed of magnetic random access memory (MRAM). It is commonly assumed
that the FeCo and Gd atoms are switched together due to the strong exchange
coupling, which remains valid even if one performs the two-sublattice macrospin
simulation. Interestingly, using the atomistic model developed by our group, it
is clearly seen that different atoms are not switched together. In addition,
our study reveals that the nature of switching is spatially nonuniform even in
the small sample with the dimension of 20 nm-20 nm. Furthermore, the
characteristics of nonuniformity are completely different for samples with
different Gd composition (x). When x is close to the magnetization compensation
point, successful switching cannot be obtained, but is accompanied by the
stable oscillation. The atom type that dominates the oscillation is different
from that predicted by the two-sublattice macrospin model. In addition, the
size of singular region is a non-monotonic function of current density. All
these results can only be understood by considering the spatial nonuniform
magnetization dynamics.

<h3>Twisted domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01748" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01748</a>
<br>
<i>Vladimira Novotna, Lubor Lejcek, Natalia Podoliak</i>
<p>Ferroelectric nematics present properties promising for applications, which
strongly depend on the confinement conditions and the presence of defects. In
this work, we have observed and analysed textures in the cells with homogeneous
geometry for a ferroelectric nematogen. The studied compound reveals the
ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, directly on cooling from the isotropic phase.
The NF phase is stable and persists down to the room temperatures. Textures in
the homogeneous cell with antiparallel alignment prefer to be arranged in
twisted domains with borderlines oriented preferentially in the perpendicular
direction with respect to the surface alignment (rubbing direction). We have
described these domains and developed a model of 2/pi disclinations, which are
separating the areas with an opposite twist sense. We discussed the character
of disclination charge and explained why these disclination lines prefer to be
oriented perpendicularly to the rubbing direction.

<h3>Local distortion driven magnetic phase switching in pyrochlore  $Yb_2(Ti_{1-x}Sn_x)_2O_7$</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuanpeng Zhang, Zhiling Dun, Yunqi Cai, Chengkun Xing, Qi Cui, Naveen Kumar Chogondahalli Muniraju, Qiang Zhang, Yongqing Li, Jinguang Cheng, Haidong Zhou</i>
<p>While it is commonly accepted that the disorder induced by magnetic ion
doping in quantum magnets usually generates a rugged free-energy landscape
resulting in slow or glassy spin dynamics, the disorder/distortion effects
associated with non-magnetic ion sites doping are still illusive. Here, using
AC susceptibility measurements, we show that the mixture of Sn/Ti on the
non-magnetic ion sites of pyrochlore $Yb_2(Ti_{1-x}Sn_x)_2O_7$ induces an
antiferromagnetic ground state despite both parent compounds, $Yb_2Ti_2O_7$,
and $Yb_2Sn_2O_7$, order ferromagnetically. Local structure studies through
neutron total scattering reveals the local distortion in the non-magnetic ion
sites and its strong correlation with the magnetic phase switching. Our study,
for the first time, demonstrates the local distortion as induced by the
non-magnetic ion site mixture could be a new path to achieve magnetic phase
switching, which has been traditionally obtained by external stimuli such as
temperature, magnetic field, pressure, strain, light, etc.

<h3>Relative energy constraint in Boltzmann's surface entropy eliminates  thermodynamic inconsistencies and allows negative absolute temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01838" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01838</a>
<br>
<i>Ananth Govind Rajan</i>
<p>Over the past century, an intense debate in statistical mechanics has been
about the correctness of Boltzmann's surface entropy versus Gibbs' volume
entropy, for isolated systems. Both entropies make significantly different
predictions for systems with few degrees of freedom. Even in the thermodynamic
limit, they can disagree-while Boltzmann entropy allows negative absolute
temperatures to exist, Gibbs entropy precludes such a possibility. Here, we
show that modifying Boltzmann's entropy via a relative energy tolerance
eliminates thermodynamic inconsistencies in several model systems with
unbounded energy spectra by ensuring positive, finite temperatures.
Concomitantly, the proposed entropy allows for negative temperatures in systems
with bounded spectra and closely matches canonical ensemble predictions. This
work conclusively remedies the prevalent deficiencies of the Gibbs and
Boltzmann entropy formulations and paves the way for the use of the modified
Boltzmann entropy in the microcanonical ensemble, allowing negative
temperatures to exist.

<h3>A critical nematic phase with pseudogap-like behavior in twisted  bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01844</a>
<br>
<i>Virginia Gali, Matthias Hecker, Rafael M. Fernandes</i>
<p>The crystallographic restriction theorem constrains two-dimensional
nematicity to display either Ising ($Z_{2}$) or three-state-Potts ($Z_{3}$)
critical behaviors, both of which are dominated by amplitude fluctuations.
Here, we use group theory and microscopic modeling to show that this constraint
is circumvented in a $30^{\circ}$-twisted hexagonal bilayer due to its emergent
quasicrystalline symmetries. We find a critical phase dominated by phase
fluctuations of a $Z_{6}$ nematic order parameter and bounded by two
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, which displays only
quasi-long-range nematic order. The electronic spectrum in the critical phase
displays a thermal pseudogap-like behavior, whose properties depend on the
anomalous critical exponent. We also show that an out-of-plane magnetic field
induces nematic phase fluctuations that suppress the two BKT transitions via a
mechanism analogous to the Hall viscoelastic response of the lattice, giving
rise to a putative nematic quantum critical point with emergent continuous
symmetry. Finally, we demonstrate that even in the case of an untwisted
bilayer, a critical phase emerges when the nematic order parameter changes sign
between the two layers, establishing an odd-parity nematic state.

<br>
<i>Josiah Roberts, Biswas Rijal, Simon Divilov, Jon-Paul Maria, William G. Fahrenholtz, Douglas E. Wolfe, Donald W. Brenner, Stefano Curtarolo, Eva Zurek</i>
<p>Large density functional theory databases are a treasure trove of energies,
forces and stresses that can be used to train machine learned interatomic
potentials for atomistic modeling. Herein, we employ structural relaxations
from the AFLOW database to train moment tensor potentials for four carbide
systems. HfTaC, HfZrC, MoWC and TaTiC. The resulting MTPs are used to relax
6300 random symmetric structures, and subsequently improved via active learning
to generate robust potentials that can be applied to a wide variety of
structures, and accurate potentials designed only for low-energy systems. This
protocol is shown to yield convex hulls that are indistinguishable from those
predicted by AFLOW for the HfTaC, HfZrC and TaTiC systems, and in the case of
the CMoW system to predict thermodynamically stable structures that are not
found within AFLOW, highlighting the potential of the employed protocol within
crystal structure prediction. Relaxation of over three hundred Mo1xWxC
stoichiometry crystals first with the RP then with the AP yields formation
enthalpies that are in excellent agreement with those obtained via DFT.
