<h3>Transition from Susceptible-Infected to Susceptible-Infected-Recovered  Dynamics in a Susceptible-Cleric-Zombie-Recovered Active Matter Model</h3>

<br>
The Susceptible-Infected (SI) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models
provide two distinct representations of epidemic evolution, distinguished by
the lack of spontaneous recovery in the SI model. Here we introduce a new
active matter epidemic model, the ``Susceptible-Cleric-Zombie-Recovered''
(SCZR) model, in which spontaneous recovery is absent but zombies can recover
with probability $\gamma$ via interaction with a cleric. Upon interacting with
a zombie, both susceptibles and clerics can enter the zombie state with
probability $\beta$ and $\alpha$, respectively. By changing the intial fraction
of clerics or their healing ability rate $\gamma$, we can tune the SCZR model
between SI dynamics, in which no susceptibles or clerics remain at long times,
and SIR dynamics, in which no zombies remain at long times. The model is
relevant to certain real world diseases such as HIV where spontaneous recovery
is impossible but where medical interventions by a limited number of caregivers
can reduce or eliminate the spread of infection.

Hydrodynamics accurately describes relativistic heavy-ion collision
experiments well before local thermal equilibrium is established. This
unexpectedly rapid onset of hydrodynamics -- which takes place on the fastest
available timescale -- is called hydrodynamization. It occurs when an
interacting quantum system is quenched with an energy density that is much
greater than its initial energy density. During hydrodynamization, energy gets
redistributed across very different energy scales. Hydrodynamization precedes
local equilibration among momentum modes, which is local prethermalization to a
generalized Gibbs ensemble in nearly integrable systems or local thermalization
in non-integrable systems. Many theories of quantum dynamics postulate local
(pre)thermalization, but the associated timescale has not been quantitatively
studied. Here we use an array of 1D Bose gases to directly observe both
hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. After we apply a Bragg
scattering pulse, hydrodynamization is evident in the fast redistribution of
energy among distant momentum modes, which occurs on timescales associated with
the Bragg peak energies. Local prethermalization can be seen in the slower
redistribution of occupation among nearby momentum modes. We find that the time
scale for local prethermalization in our system is inversely proportional to
the momenta involved. During hydrodynamization and local prethermalization,
existing theories cannot quantitatively model our experiment. Exact theoretical
calculations in the Tonks-Girardeau limit show qualitatively similar features.

<h3>Site-selective ion beam synthesis and optical properties of individual  CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots in a SiO2 matrix</h3>

Cadmium selenide nanocrystal quantum dots (NC-QDs) are site-selectively
synthesized by sequential ion beam implantation of selenium and cadmium ions in
a SiO2 matrix through sub-micron apertures followed by a rapid thermal
annealing step. The size, areal density and optical emission energy of the
NC-QDs are controlled by the ion fluence during implantation and the diameter
of implantation aperture. For low fluences and small apertures the emission of
these optically active emitters is blue-shifted compared to that of the bulk
material by $>100\,{\rm meV}$ due to quantum confinement. The emission exhibits
spectral diffusion and blinking on a second timescales as established also for
solution synthesized NC-QDs.

Many-body instabilities and topological physics are two attractive topics in
condensed matter physics. It is intriguing to explore the interplay between
these phenomena in a single quantum material. Here, using the prototypical
charge density wave (CDW) material monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$ as an example, we show
how momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling drives the CDW transition from
$3\times3$ to $2\times2$ phase under electron doping. More interestingly, we
find the coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial topology in one of the
two $2\times2$ CDW phases, the latter of which is identified by the nonzero
Z$_2$ invariant with ideal Dirac cone edge states near the Fermi level. A
similar CDW transition-induced topological superconductor has also been
confirmed in monolayer 1H-TaSe$_2$. Our findings not only reveal a unique and
general method to introduce nontrivial topology by CDW transition, but also
provide an ideal platform to modulate different quantum orders by electron
doping, thus stimulating experimental interest.

<h3>Correlated insulating states in carbon nanotubes controlled by magnetic  field</h3>

We investigate competing insulating phases in nearly metallic zigzag carbon
nanotubes, under conditions where an applied magnetic flux approximately closes
the single particle gap in one valley. Recent experiments have shown that an
energy gap persists throughout magnetic field sweeps where the single-particle
picture predicts that the gap should close and reopen. Using a bosonic
low-energy effective theory to describe the interplay between electron-electron
interactions, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic field, we obtain a phase
diagram consisting of several competing insulating phases that can form in the
vicinity of the single-particle gap closing point. We characterize these phases
in terms of spin-resolved charge polarization densities, each of which can
independently take one of two possible values consistent with the mirror
symmetry of the system, or can take an intermediate value through a spontaneous
mirror symmetry breaking transition. In the mirror symmetry breaking phase,
adiabatic changes of the orbital magnetic flux drive charge and spin currents
along the nanotube. We discuss the relevance of these results to recent and
future experiments.

<h3>Strain induced quasi-unidimensional channels in twisted moiré lattices</h3>

We study the effects of strain in moir\'e systems composed of honeycomb
lattices. We elucidate the formation of almost perfect one-dimensional moir\'e
patterns in twisted bilayer systems. The formation of such patterns is a
consequence of an interplay between twist and strain which gives rise to a
collapse of the reciprocal space unit cell. As a criterion for such collapse we
find a simple relation between the two quantities and the material specific
Poisson ratio. The induced one dimensional behavior is characterized by two,
usually incommensurate, periodicities. Our results offer explanations for the
complex patterns of one-dimensional channels observed in low angle twisted
bilayer graphene systems and twisted bilayer dicalcogenides. Our findings can
be applied to any hexagonal twisted moir\'e pattern and can be easily extended
to other geometries.

<h3>Measurement-induced phase transitions on dynamical quantum trees</h3>

Monitored many-body systems fall broadly into two dynamical phases,
``entangling'' or ``disentangling'', separated by a transition as a function of
the rate at which measurements are made on the system. Producing an analytical
theory of this measurement-induced transition is an outstanding challenge.
Recent work made progress in the context of tree tensor networks, which can be
related to all-to-all quantum circuit dynamics with forced (postselected)
measurement outcomes. So far, however, there are no exact solutions for
dynamics of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom (qubits) with ``real'' measurements,
whose outcome probabilities are sampled according to the Born rule. Here we
define dynamical processes for qubits, with real measurements, that have a
tree-like spacetime interaction graph, either collapsing or expanding the
system as a function of time. The former case yields an exactly solvable
measurement transition. We explore these processes analytically and
numerically, exploiting the recursive structure of the tree. We compare the
case of ``real'' measurements with the case of ``forced'' measurements. Both
cases show a transition at a nontrivial value of the measurement strength, with
the real measurement case exhibiting a smaller entangling phase. Both exhibit
exponential scaling of the entanglement near the transition, but they differ in
the value of a critical exponent. An intriguing difference between the two
cases is that the real measurement case lies at the boundary between two
distinct types of critical scaling. On the basis of our results we propose a
protocol for realizing a measurement phase transition experimentally via an
expansion process.

<h3>Anatomy of Spin and Current Generation from Magnetization Gradients in  Topological Insulators and Rashba Metals</h3>

<br>
We explore the spin and charge currents arising on the surface of a
topological insulator and in a 2D Rashba metal due to magnetization gradients.
For topological insulators a single coefficient controls both effects, and this
becomes quantized due to the presence of the Dirac point. Switching on an
infinitesimal pairing gap immediately halves the value of this coefficient due
to an anomalous contribution which stems from the appearance of additional
Dirac points. The coefficient is continuously reduced by further increasing the
pairing gap. In contrast, Rashba metals do not present such anomalies.
Nonetheless, the coefficient for current induction is still discontinuous for a
clean system, while its continuity is restored with disorder. Here, the spin
and current coefficients depend non-monotonically on the pairing gap. Our
results uncover the so far unexplored role of superconductivity on the coupling
that drives skyrmion-vortex binding. Moreover, they open the door to
alternative realizations of the superconducting diode effect using gradients of
the out-of-plane magnetization. As we discuss, the latter also promotes
composite vortex-Majorana excitations.

<h3>Phase Diagram of Mixed-Dimensional Anisotropic t-J-Models</h3>

<br>
We study the phase diagram of two different mixed-dimensional
$t-J_z-J_{\perp}$-models on the square lattice, in which the hopping amplitude
$t$ is only nonzero along the $x$-direction. In the first, bosonic, model, the
spin exchange amplitude $J_{\perp}$ is negative and isotropic along the $x$ and
$y$ directions of the lattice, and $J_z$ is isotropic and positive. The
low-energy physics is characterized by spin-charge separation: the holes hop as
free fermions in an easy-plane ferromagnetic background. In the second model,
$J_{\perp}$ is restricted to the $x$-axis while $J_z$ remains isotropic and
positive. The model is agnostic to particle statistics, and shows stripe
patterns with anti-ferromagnetic N{\'e}el order at low temperature and high
hole concentrations, in resemblance of the mixed-dimensional $t-J_z$ and $t-J$
models. At lower hole concentration, a very strong first order transition and
hysteresis loop is seen extending to a remarkably high 14(1)% hole doping.

<br>
We have developed a versatile near-field microscopy platform that can operate
at high magnetic fields and below liquid-helium temperatures. We use this
platform to demonstrate an extreme terahertz (THz) nanoscope operation and to
obtain the first cryogenic magneto-THz time-domain nano-spectroscopy/imaging at
temperatures as low as 1.8 K and magnetic fields of up to 5 T simultaneously.
Our cryogenic magneto-THz scanning near-field optical microscopy, or cm-SNOM,
instrument comprises three main equipment: i) a 5 T split pair magnetic
cryostat with a custom made insert for mounting SNOM inside; ii) an atomic
force microscope (AFM) unit that accepts ultrafast THz excitation and iii) a
MHz repetition rate, femtosecond laser amplifier for high-field THz pulse
generation and sensitive detection. We apply the cm-SNOM to obtain proof of
principle measurements of superconducting and topological materials. The new
capabilities demonstrated break grounds for studying quantum materials that
requires extreme environment of cryogenic operation and applied magnetic fields
simultaneously in nanometer space, femtosecond time, and terahertz energy
scales.

<h3>Dynamics of van der Waals Charge Qubit in 2D Bilayers: Ab initio Quantum  Transport and Qubit Measurement</h3>

<br>
A van der Waals (vdW) charge qubit, electrostatically confined within
two-dimensional (2D) vdW materials, is proposed as building block of future
quantum computers. Its characteristics are systematically evaluated with
respect to its two-level anti-crossing energy difference ($\Delta$). Bilayer
graphene ($\Delta$ $\approx$ 0) and a vdW heterostructure ($\Delta$ $\gg$ 0)
are used as representative examples. Their tunable electronic properties with
an external electric field define the state of the charge qubit. By combining
density functional theory and quantum transport calculations, we highlight the
optimal qubit operation conditions based on charge stability and energy-level
diagrams. Moreover, a single-electron transistor (SET) design based on trilayer
vdW heterostructures capacitively coupled to the charge qubit is introduced as
measurement setup with low decoherence and improved measurement properties. It
is found that a $\Delta$ greater than 20 meV results in a rapid mixing of the
qubit states, which leads to a lower measurement quantity, i.e. contrast and
conductance. With properly optimized designs, qubit architectures relying on 2D
vdW structures could be integrated into an all-electronic quantum computing
platform.

<h3>Multilevel switching due to spin-orbit torques in Co/Pt/Co</h3>

Spin-orbit torque current-induced magnetization switching provides an
energy-efficient way of manipulating the magnetization in the ferromagnetic
layers. Here, we present a detailed study of multilevel magnetization switching
via spin-orbit torque in the Co/Pt/Co heterostructure with varied Pt thickness.
Hence, the Pt layer plays the role of a spacer, providing the ability to
control interlayer exchange coupling. As a result of the asymmetry between the
top Pt/Co and bottom Co/Pt interfaces, and the coupling between the Co layers,
four separate resistance states emerge when the external magnetic field is
applied in the direction of the charge current. We reproduce the multilevel
current switching mechanism using a numerical macro-spin model using the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation. Finally, we propose an
explanation of the accompanying multi-domain behavior, supported by
measurements from polar-magnetooptical Kerr microscopy. Based on our findings,
multilevel switching may have a potential application in energy-efficient
high-density memory cells.

<h3>Pair distribution function analysis for oxide defect identification  through feature extraction and supervised learning</h3>

<br>
Feature extraction and a neural network model are applied to predict the
defect types and concentrations in experimental TiO$_2$ samples. A dataset of
TiO$_2$ structures with vacancies and interstitials of oxygen and titanium is
built and the structures are relaxed using energy minimization. The features of
the calculated pair distribution functions (PDFs) of these defected structures
are extracted using linear methods (principal component analysis, non-negative
matrix factorization) and non-linear methods (autoencoder, convolutional neural
network). The extracted features are used as the inputs to a neural network
that maps the feature weights to the concentration of each defect type. The
performance of this machine learning pipeline is validated by predicting the
defect concentrations based on experimentally-measured TiO$_2$ PDFs and
comparing the results to brute-force predictions. A physics-based
initialization of the autoencoder has the highest accuracy in predicting the
defect concentrations. This model incorporates physical interpretability and
predictability of material properties, enabling a more efficient material
characterization process with scattering data.

<br>
For a many-body system of arbitrary dimension, we consider fermionic ground
states of non-interacting Hamiltonians invariant under a $C_2$ cyclic group.
The absolute difference $\Delta$ between the number of occupied symmetric and
anti-symmetric single-particle states is an adiabatic invariant. We prove lower
bounds on the configurational and the number entropy based on this invariant.
In band insulators, the topological invariant $\Delta$ and the entropy bounds
can be directly determined from high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a popular candidate for electronic and optical
switching applications due to its well-known semiconductor-metal transition.
Its study is notoriously challenging due to the interplay of long and short
range elastic distortions, as well as the symmetry change, and the electronic
structure changes. The inherent coupling of lattice and electronic degrees of
freedom opens the avenue towards mechanical actuation of single domains. In
this work, we show that we can manipulate and monitor the reversible
semiconductor-to-metal transition of VO2 while applying a controlled amount of
mechanical pressure by a nanosized metallic probe using an atomic force
microscope. At a critical pressure, we can reversibly actuate the phase
transition with a large modulation of the conductivity. Direct tunneling
through the VO2-metal contact is observed as the main charge carrier injection
mechanism before and after the phase transition of VO2. The tunneling barrier
is formed by a very thin but persistently insulating surfacelayer of the VO2.
The necessary pressure to induce the transition decreases with temperature. In
addition, we measured the phase coexistence line in a hitherto unexplored
regime. Our study provides valuable information on pressure-induced electronic
modifications of the VO2 properties, as well as on nanoscale metal-oxide
contacts, which can help in the future design of oxide electronics.

Ulta-wide bandgap semiconductors based on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ offer the
potential to achieve higher power switching performance, efficiency, and lower
manufacturing cost than today's wide bandgap power semiconductors. However, the
most critical challenge to the commercialization of Ga$_2$O$_3$ electronics is
overheating, which impacts the device's performance and reliability. We
fabricated a Ga$_2$O$_3$/4H-SiC composite wafer using a fusion-bonding method.
A low temperature ($\le$ 600 $^{\circ}$C) device processing approach based on
low-temperature (LT) metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy is developed to grow a
Ga$_2$O$_3$ epitaxial channel layer on the composite wafer and subsequently
fabricate into Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs. This LT approach is essential to
preserve the structural integrity of the composite wafer. These LT-grown
epitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs deliver high thermal performance (56% reduction
in channel temperature), high voltage blocking capabilities up to 2.45 kV, and
power figures of merit of $\sim$ 300 MW/cm$^2$, which is a record high for any
heterogeneously integrated Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices reported to date. This work is
the first realization of multi-kilovolt homoepitaxial Ga$_2$O$_3$ power MOSFETs
fabricated on a composite substrate with high heat transfer performance which
delivers state-of-the-art power density values while running much cooler than
those on native substrates. Thermal characterization and modeling results
reveal that a Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond composite wafer with a reduced Ga$_2$O$_3$
thickness ($\sim$ 1 $\mu$m) and thinner bonding interlayer ($<$ 10 nm) can
reduce the device thermal impedance to a level lower than today's GaN-on-SiC
power switches.

<h3>Determination of Fermi surface by charge density correlations</h3>

The Fermi surface topology in the two-dimensional Hubbard model is
particularly relevant for the high-temperature superconductors, whereas its
theoretical research encounters with the difficulty of the analytical
continuation problem. To this end, we proposed the concept of the
momentum-dependent compressibility, defined as the variation of the momentum
distribution function with respect to the chemical potential. The surface
determined by the maximum of the momentum-dependent compressibility is nearly
identical to the Fermi surface in the weakly and intermediate coupling regions
according to our numerical results. In the correlated region, this surface also
exhibits pocket and arc features, just like the Fermi surface in
high-temperature superconductors. Therefore, for theoretical studies, this
surface can be used as an alternative to determine the underlying Fermi
surface. Considering that the momentum-dependent compressibility is closely
related to the charge density correlations, our work also shows a connection
between the Fermi surface topology and the charge density fluctuations.

<br>
We report a detailed study of the magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic
properties of Ce$_2$Te$_5$ single crystals, a layered $f$-electron van der
Waals magnet. Four consecutive transitions at $\sim$ 5.2, 2.1, 0.9, and 0.4 K
were observed in the $ac$-plane electrical resistivity $\rho$(T), which were
further confirmed in specific heat $C_\textrm{p}$(T) measurements. Analysis of
the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$(T), the magnetic-field variation of
$\rho$(T), and the increase of the first transition temperature ($T_\textrm{c}
\sim$ 5.2 K) with applied magnetic field indicates ferromagnetic order, while
the decrease of the other transitions with field suggests different states with
dominant antiferromagnetic interactions below $T_2 \sim$ 2.1 K, $T_3 \sim$ 0.9
K, and $T_4$ = 0.4 K. Critical behavior analysis around $T_\textrm{c}$ that
gives critical exponents $\beta = 0.31(2)$, $\gamma = 0.99(2)$, $\delta =
4.46(1)$, $T_\textrm{c} = 5.32(1)$ K indicates that Ce$_2$Te$_5$ shows a
three-dimensional magnetic critical behavior. Moreover, the Hall resistivity
$\rho_{\textrm{xy}}$ indicates that Ce$_2$Te$_5$ is a multi-band system with a
relatively high electron mobility $\sim 2900$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ near
$T_\textrm{c}$, providing further opportunities for future device applications.

two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials. Understanding of CDW suppression
mechanism, its connection to emerging superconducting state and electronic
correlations provides opportunities for engineering the electronic properties
of vdW heterostructures and thin film devices. Using combination of the thermal
transport, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, Raman measurements, and
first-principle calculations, we observe an increase in electronic correlations
of the conducting states as CDW is suppressed in ZrTe$_3$ with 5\% Cu and Ni
intercalation in the vdW gap. As superconductivity emerges, intercalation
brings decoupling of quasi-one-dimensional conduction electrons with phonons as
a consequence of intercalation-induced lattice expansion but also a drastic
increase in Zr$^{2+}$ at the expense of Zr$^{4+}$ metal atoms. These
observation demonstrate the potential of atomic intercalates in vdW gap for
ground state tuning but also illustrate the crucial role of Zr metal valence in
formation of collective electronic orders.

We report anomalous circularly polarized Raman spectra of phonons in right-
and left-handed quartzes. The phonon branches splitting from the E-mode at a
finite wavenumber were found to be chiral with mutually opposite angular
momenta. Our analysis reveals the Raman selection rules for chiral phonons. We
also find that the conservation of angular momenta should be satisfied between
two photons and one chiral phonon in the Raman process. Furthermore, we
experimentally show that the helicity of phonons with a certain frequency and
wavevector should be the opposite in the other enantiomer.

<br>
Here we use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to study the
pnictide superconductor, BaNi$_2$As$_2$, which goes through a tetragonal to
triclinic phase transition at ~136 K. In the triclinic phase, we observe the
quasiparticle interference and the unidirectional charge density wave (CDW)
with $Q$ = 1/3 on the Ba surface of BaNi$_2$As$_2$. On the NiAs surface, apart
from the unidirectional CDW, there are structural-modulation-induced chain-like
superstructures with distinct periodicities. These complex chain-like
structures can be along different lattice directions, which forms two domain
structures. The unidirectional CDW appears more prominent in the NiAs domain
where it is perpendicular to the chain-like superstructures. In the tetragonal
phase, the $Q$ = 1/3 unidirectional CDW disappears on both the Ba and the NiAs
surfaces, and the NiAs surface appears as the ordered atomic chains with the 1
x 2 periodicity. Our results provide important insights for the interplay among
the structural modulation, the unidirectional CDW and the nematicity in this
class of materials.

The behavior of granular column collapses is associated with the dynamics of
geohazards, such as debris flows, landslides, and pyroclastic flows, yet its
underlying physics is still not well understood. In this paper, we explore
granular column collapses using the spheropolyhedral discrete element method
(DEM), where the system contains two types of particles with different
frictional properties. We impose three different mixing ratios and multiple
different particle frictional coefficients, which lead to different run-out
distances and deposition heights. Based on our previous work and a simple
mixture theory, we propose a new effective initial aspect ratio for the
bi-frictional granular mixture, which helps unify the description of the
relative run-out distances. We analyze the kinematics of bi-frictional granular
column collapses and find that deviations from classical power-law scaling in
both the dimensionless terminal time and the dimensionless time when the system
reaches the maximum kinetic energy may result from differences in the initial
solid fraction and initial structures. To clarify the influence of initial
states, we further decrease the initial solid fraction of granular column
collapses, and propose a trial function to quantitatively describe its
influence. Due to the utilization of a simple mixture theory of contact
occurrence probability, this study can be associated with the
friction-dependent rheology of granular systems and friction-induced granular
segregations, and further generalized into applications with multiple species
of particles in various natural and engineering mixtures.

Systems that can be described with the same mathematical models that account
for the properties of electrons in graphene are known as graphene-like systems.
These include magnons, photons, polaritons, acoustic waves, and electrons in
honeycomb lattices, either natural or artificial. All of them feature an
outstanding property, the existence of states localized at the edges. We
distinguish two classes of edge states depending on whether or not a
topological band gap is present in the two-dimensional energy bands. We
introduce the theory of edge states in terms of tight-binding models and
discuss their properties, with an emphasis on the interplay between their
one-way character and the topological nature of the bulk phase.

<br>
We have developed a microscopic theory on phonon energy dispersion in chiral
crystals within a harmonic approximation. One of the main issues is about the
splitting of sound velocity of acoustic phonons with opposite ``crystal''
angular momentum. We have shown that the splitting must be zero even in chiral
crystals and the difference starts from the order of at least $k^2$ or higher
in their energy dispersion. Splitting is evident for chiral optical phonons,
and we have derived a formula for their $k$-linear splitting. Another important
finding is about possible interactions of atomic displacements in microscopic
models. We have found that antisymmetric interactions of $\mathbf{D} _{ij}
\cdot (\mathbf{d} _i \times \mathbf{d} _j) $ type are not allowed in
microscopic Hamiltonians for chiral phonons in compatible with the stability
against the Nambu-Goldstone mode. We have identified that the splitting in both
acoustic and optical modes arises from the harmonic potentials with the
electric toroidal quadrupole of $G_{u}$-type symmetry. These constraint are
important for modeling real materials. Most of our microscopic calculations
have been performed for (quasi-)one-dimensional systems with a trigonal crystal
symmetry including Te, but these results generally hold also for other chiral
phonon systems.

The structure in the charge density wave states of AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb,
Cs) kagome superconductors remains elusive. There are three possible structure
candidates, tri-hexagonal, star-of-David, and their mixture. Here we perform a
systematic first principle nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) study on the structure of AV$_3$Sb$_5$. By comparing
with experimental data, we conclude that the NQR spectrum directly determines
that the tri-hexagonal structure is the proper structure for AV$_3$Sb$_5$ after
its charge density wave phase transition. This result is also consistent with
the NMR observations.

<br>
Thin films of rhombohedral graphite are becoming a popular platform for the
studies of strongly correlated states of electrons in 2D materials, due to
topologically protected flat bands on their surfaces. In this work, we study
rhombohedral graphite with a twin boundary stacking fault, where the low-energy
dispersion is comprised of four bands strongly localised at the surfaces and at
the twinned interface. We derive an effective 4-band low energy model, where we
implement the full set of Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure (SWMcC) parameters, and
analyse the semimetallic properties of low-energy bands and their topological
properties. We find the conditions for the bands to be localised at the twin
boundary, protected from the environment-induced disorder that is screened by
the surface states. This protection together with a high density of states at
the charge neutrality point, in some cases -- due to a Lifshitz transition,
makes this system a promising candidate for being a strongly-correlated
material.

Four series of PLA based composite films containing horizontally aligned few
layer graphene (FLG) flakes of high aspect ratio and adsorbed albumin are
prepared. The mechanical and thermal properties vary with percentage,
dispersion degree and size of FLG flakes. Great improvement up to 290 and 360%
of tensile modulus and strength respectively was obtained for the composite
containing high lateral size of FLG at 0.17% wt., and up to 60 and 80% for the
composite with very well dispersed 0.02% wt. FLG. The composites of PLA and
PEG-PLLA containing very well dispersed FLG flakes at 0.07 % wt. are ductile
showing enhancement of elongation at break up to respectively 80 and 88%.
Relatively high electrical conductivity, 5 x 10-3 S/cm, is measured for PLA
film charged with 3% of FLG.

Few layer graphene (FLG) was synthesized by $\mu$-wave assisted exfoliation
of expanded graphite in toluene with an overall yield from c.a. 7% to 20%. A
significant difference in the absorption of $\mu$-waves by the expanded
graphite and toluene allowed a rapid heating of the medium. The number of FLG
sheets varies from 3 to 12, while the lateral size of the sheets exceeds few
$\mu$ms. The obtained FLG exhibits very low resistance with average value of
1.6 k$\Omega$ (500 $\Omega$ minimum) which is comparable to that of high
quality graphenes synthesized by CVD methods, and lower than numbers of
exfoliated graphenes.

<br>
By using non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method and tight-binding
(TB) approximation, we investigated a perfect control on spin transport in a
zigzag $\alpha^{\prime}$-boron nanoribbon ($\alpha^{\prime}$-BNR) as the must
semi-conducting structure of borophene. It has been found that when an
$\alpha^{\prime}$-BNR is exposed to an out-of-plane exchange magnetic field,
spin splitting occurs for both spin-up and spin-down states in specific ranges
of energy. Therefore, the spin polarization of current could be controlled by
adjusting the energy of incoming electrons by means of an external back-gate
voltage. We focus on the edge manipulation of $\alpha^{\prime}$-BNR by
ferro-magnetic (FM) or anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) exchange field which leads to
the emergence of a giant magneto resistance and a perfect spin filtering. Local
current provides the best picture of spin distribution of current in the
nanoribbon. In order to observe the response of the system to the proximity
effect of magnetic strips, we calculate the magnetic moment of each site. Then,
we show that applying a transverse or perpendicular electric field in the
presence of the exchange magnetic field gives another controlling tool on the
spin polarization of current in a constant energy. Finally, by simultaneous
effect of in-plane and out-of-plane exchange magnetic field on the edges of
nanoribbon, we reach a control on spin rotation in the scattering region. Our
investigation guarantees the $\alpha^{\prime}$-BNR as a promising two
dimensional (2D) structure for spintronic purposes.

Density functional theory (DFT) is an essential building block for modern
theoretical physics, chemistry, and engineering, especially those concerning
electronic properties. Through decades of development, various program packages
for first-principles electronic structure calculation are now available. Their
sophisticated interfaces allow users to apply DFT to actual systems, even
without knowing the theory. It is hence becoming more and more important to
recall the fundamentals of how DFT enables accurate calculations. This article
attempts to provide such knowledge with a minimal overview of DFT -- its basic
foundation, relations to observable electronic and nuclear dynamical
properties, and some of its cutting-edge applications.

seen in polarized neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of the
remagnetization process suggests the generic impact of the DMI on the
macroscopic magnetic parameters of polycrystalline defect-rich materials.

The microscopic mechanism of the hydrogen-induced metal-insulator transition
in SmNiO$_3$ is clarified by means of density-functional theory with the
Hubbard U correction. While 100% of hydrogen doping per Ni atom has been
supposed to be responsible for the metal-insulator transition, we found that
50% of hydrogen doping results in an outstandingly stable atomic structure
showing the insulating property. The stable crystal structure shows the
peculiar layered pattern of charge disproportionation of Ni$^{2+}$ and
Ni$^{3+}$ valences together with the strong Jahn-Teller distortion that causes
the eg orbital state splitting and opens the band gap.

<br>
Spin gapless semiconductors exhibit a finite band gap for one spin channel
and closed gap for other spin channel, emerged as a new state of magnetic
materials with a great potential for spintronic applications. The first
experimental evidence for the spin gapless semiconducting behavior was observed
in an inverse Heusler compound Mn2CoAl. Here, we report a detailed
investigation of the crystal structure and anomalous Hall effect in the Mn2CoAl
using experimental and theoretical studies. The analysis of the high-resolution
synchrotron x-ray diffraction data shows anti-site disorder between Mn and Al
atoms within the inverse Heusler structure. The temperature-dependent
resistivity shows semiconducting behavior and follows Mooijs criteria for
disordered metal. Scaling behavior of the anomalous Hall resistivity suggests
that the anomalous Hall effect in the Mn2CoAl is primarily governed by
intrinsic mechanism due to the Berry curvature in momentum space. The
experimental intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is found to be 35
S/cm, which is considerably larger than the theoretically predicted value for
ordered Mn2CoAl. Our first-principle calculations conclude that the anti-site
disorder between Mn and Al atoms enhances the Berry curvature and hence the
value of intrinsic AHC, which is in a very well agreement with the experiment.

We investigate the stationary flow of a colloidal gel under an inhomogeneous
external shear force using adaptive Brownian dynamics simulations. The
interparticle forces are derived from the Stillinger-Weber potential, where the
three-body term is tuned to enable network formation and gelation in
equilibrium. When subjected to the shear force field, the system develops
remarkable modulations in the one-body density profile. Depending on the shear
magnitude, particles accumulate either in quiescent regions or in the vicinity
of maximum net flow, and we deduce this strong non-equilibrium response to be
characteristic of the gel state. Studying the components of the internal force
parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction reveals that the emerging flow
and structure of the stationary state are driven by significant viscous and
structural superadiabatic forces. Thereby, the magnitude and nature of the
observed non-equilibrium phenomena differs from the corresponding behavior of
simple fluids. We demonstrate that a simple power functional theory reproduces
accurately the viscous force profile, giving a rationale of the complex
dynamical behavior of the system.

<br>
Linear magnetoresistance (LMR) is of particular interest for memory,
electronics, and sensing applications, especially when it does not saturate
over a wide range of magnetic fields. One of its principal origins is local
mobility or density inhomogeneities, often structural, which in the
Parish-Littlewood theory leads to an unsaturating LMR proportional to mobility.
Structural disorder, however, also tends to limit the mobility and hence the
overall LMR amplitude. An alternative route to achieve large LMR is via
non-structural inhomogeneities which do not affect the zero field mobility,
like magnetic domains. Here, linear positive magnetoresistance caused by
magnetic texture is reported in \ch{LaTiO3}/\ch{SrTiO3} heterostructures. The
LMR amplitude reaches up to 6500\% at 9T. This colossal value is understood by
the unusual combination of a very high thin film mobility, up to 40 000
cm$^2$/V.s, and a very large coverage of low-mobility regions. These regions
correlate with a striped magnetic structure, compatible with a spiral magnetic
texture in the \ch{LaTiO3} film, revealed by low temperature Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy. These results provide a novel route for the
engineering of large-LMR devices.

In computational materials science, a common means for predicting macroscopic
(e.g., mechanical) properties of an alloy is to define a model using
combinations of descriptors that depend on some material properties (elastic
constants, misfit volumes, etc.), representative for the macroscopic behavior.
The material properties are usually computed using special quasi-random
structures (SQSs), in tandem with density functional theory (DFT). However, DFT
scales cubically with the number of atoms and is thus impractical for a
screening over many alloy compositions.
Here, we present a novel methodology which combines modeling approaches and
machine-learning interatomic potentials. Machine-learning interatomic
potentials are orders of magnitude faster than DFT, while achieving similar
accuracy, allowing for a predictive and tractable high-throughput screening
over the whole alloy space. The proposed methodology is illustrated by
predicting the room temperature ductility of the medium-entropy alloy Mo-Nb-Ta.

Compton scattering is a well-established technique that can provide detailed
information about electronic states in solids. Making use of the principle of
tomography, it is possible to determine the Fermi surface from sets of
Compton-scattering data with different scattering axes. Practical applications,
however, are limited due to long acquisition time required for measuring along
enough number of scattering directions. Here, we propose to overcome this
difficulty using compressed sensing. Taking advantage of a hidden sparsity in
the momentum distribution, we are able to reconstruct the three-dimensional
momentum distribution of bcc-Li, and identify the Fermi surface with as little
as 14 directions of scattering data with unprecedented accuracy. This
compressed-sensing approach will permit further wider applications of the
Compton scattering experiments.

A variety of analytical approaches have been developed for the study of
quantum spin systems in two dimensions, the notable ones being spin-waves,
slave boson/fermion parton constructions, and for lattices with one-to-one
local correspondence of faces and vertices, the 2D Jordan-Wigner (JW)
fermionization. Field-theoretically, JW fermionization is implemented through
Chern-Simons (CS) flux attachment. For a correct fermionization of lattice
quantum spin-$1/2$ magnets, it is necessary that the fermions obey mutual
bosonic (anyonic) statistics under exchange - this is not possible to implement
on arbitrary 2D lattices if fermionic matter couples only to the lattice gauge
fields. Enlarging the gauge degrees of freedom to include the dual lattice
allows the construction of consistent mutual Chern-Simons field theories. Here
we propose a mutual CS theory where the microscopic (spin) degrees of freedom
are represented as lattice fermionic matter additionally coupled to specific
combinations of dual lattice gauge fields that depend on the local geometry. We
illustrate the use of this method for understanding the properties of a
honeycomb Kitaev model subjected to a strong Zeeman field in the $z$-direction.

An analogy is drawn between version of non-equilibrium thermodynamics a
distribution-based containing an additional thermodynamic first-passage time
parameter and Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics with flows as an additional
thermodynamic parameter. Thermodynamics containing an additional thermodynamic
first-passage time parameter maps to Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics.
Various conditions for the dependence of the distribution parameters of the
first-passage time on the random value of energy, the first thermodynamic
parameter, are considered. It is shown that more meaningful results are
recorded when the time parameter relaxation time {\tau} of Extended
Irreversible Thermodynamics is replaced by the average first-passage time.
Expressions are obtained for the average first-passage time through the flows.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are known to have a wide variety of
magnetic structures by hosting other transition metal atoms in the van der
Waals gaps. To understand the chemical trend of the magnetic properties of the
intercalated TMDs, we perform a systematic first-principles study for 48
compounds with different hosts, guests, and composition ratios. Starting with
calculations based on spin density functional theory, we derive classical spin
models by applying the Liechtenstein method to the ab initio Wannier-based
tight-binding model. We show that the calculated exchange couplings are overall
consistent with the experiments. In particular, when the composition rate is
1/3, the chemical trend can be understood in terms of the occupation of the
3d-orbital in the intercalated transition metal. The present results give us a
useful guiding principle to predict the magnetic structure of compounds that
are yet to be synthesized.

The present paper is the second of a series of publications that aim at
investigating relevant directions to turn the nuclear energy density functional
(EDF) method as an effective field theory (EFT). The EDF approach has known
numerous successes in nuclear theory over the past decades and is currently the
only microscopic technique that can be applied to all atomic nuclei. However,
the phenomenological character of the EDF method also comes with important
limitations, such as the lack of an explicit connection with quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). As was argued in the first paper of this series,
reformulating the EDF framework as an EFT would enable us to overcome these
limitations. In particular, path-integral (PI) techniques are suited to achieve
such a purpose as they allow to design numerous non-perturbative approximations
and can take Lagrangians possibly derived from EFTs of QCD as inputs. In our
previous paper, we have illustrated such technical features for diagrammatic PI
techniques in a study of the (0+0)-D $O(N)$-symmetric $\varphi^{4}$-theory. In
the present work, we consider another class of PI techniques, i.e. functional
renormalization group (FRG) approaches, that we apply on the same toy model.
Despite our explicit interest for the nuclear many-body problem, the presented
study is also directed towards FRG practitioners from various fields: technical
details are provided for FRG techniques based on 1-particle-irreducible (1PI),
2-particle-irreducible (2PI) and 2-particle-point-irreducible (2PPI) effective
actions (EAs), coined respectively as 1PI-, 2PI- and 2PPI-FRGs, and the
treatment of the $O(N)$ symmetry is also addressed thoroughly. Connections
between these various FRG methods are identified as well.

neighbours, and the anisotropy opens a gap in the magnon energy band structure.
A non-vanishing Berry curvature is induced by a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI). The topology of the bands is trivial (in the sense of a null
Chern number), but the finite Berry curvature induces Hall-like transport
effects whose coefficients were calculated. Their dependence on temperature and
applied magnetic field were studied and show resemblance with other magnon
insulating systems found on the literature.

We measure telegraph noise of current fluctuations in an electrostatically
defined quantum dot in bilayer graphene by real-time detection of single
electron tunneling with a capacitively coupled neighboring quantum dot.
Suppression of the second and third cumulant (related to shot noise) in a
tunable graphene quantum dot is demonstrated experimentally. With this method
we demonstrate the ability to measure very low current and noise levels.
Furthermore, we use this method to investigate the first spin excited state, an
essential prerequisite to measure spin relaxation.

We present our new experimental and theoretical framework which combines a
broadband superluminescent diode (SLED/SLD) with fast learning algorithms to
provide speed and accuracy improvements for the optimization of 1D optical
dipole potentials, here generated with a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). To
characterize the setup and potential speckle patterns arising from coherence,
we compare the superluminescent diode to a single-mode laser by investigating
interference properties. We employ Machine Learning (ML) tools to train a
physics-inspired model acting as a digital twin of the optical system
predicting the behavior of the optical apparatus including all its
imperfections. Implementing an iterative algorithm based on Iterative Learning
Control (ILC) we optimize optical potentials an order of magnitude faster than
heuristic optimization methods. We compare iterative model-based offline
optimization and experimental feedback-based online optimization. Our methods
provide a new route to fast optimization of optical potentials which is
relevant for the dynamical manipulation of ultracold gases.

We study the fractional quantum Hall effect in the central Landau level of
bilayer graphene. By tuning the external applied magnetic field and the
electric bias between the two layers one can access a regime where there is a
degeneracy between Landau levels with orbital characters corresponding to N=0
and N=1 Galilean Landau levels. While the Laughlin state is generically the
ground state for filling $\nu=1/3$ we find that it can be destroyed and
replaced by a Wigner crystal at the same filling factor by tuning the bias and
applied field. This competition does not take place at $\nu=2/3$ where the
incompressible ground state remains stable. The possibility of electrically
inducing the Wigner crystal state opens a new range of studies of this state of
matter.

Color centers in diamond are widely explored for applications in quantum
sensing, computing, and networking. Their optical, spin, and charge properties
have been extensively studied, while their interactions with itinerant carriers
are relatively unexplored. Here we show that NV centers situated within 10 nm
of the diamond surface can be converted to the neutral charge state via hole
capture. By measuring the hole capture rate, we extract the capture cross
section, which is suppressed by proximity to the diamond surface. The distance
dependence is consistent with a carrier diffusion model, indicating that the
itinerant carrier lifetime can be long, even at the diamond surface. Measuring
dynamics of near-surface NV centers offers a new tool for characterizing the
diamond surface and investigating charge transport in diamond devices.

<br>
We have computationally studied the properties of higher-order magnetic
anisotropy constants in an L10/A1-FePt coreshell system which is characterized
by a strong second-order 2-ion Fe-Pt anisotropy component. We show that the
coreshell structure induces an unexpected fourth-order anisotropy constant K2
the magnitude of which varies non-monotonically with the core-size ratio R
reaching a peak at R = 0.50. Furthermore, we find that K2 scales with the
normalized magnetization by (M/Ms)^2.2 at temperatures below the Curie
temperature - a remarkable deviation from the established Callen-Callen theory
which instead predicts a scaling exponent of 10. We construct an analytic model
which demonstrates K2 arises from the canting of the core and shell
magnetization, and successfully reproduces and justifies the scaling exponent
obtained from numerical simulation.

We analytically determine the distribution of fixed points in a canonical
model of a chaotic neural network. This distribution reveals that fixed points
and dynamics are confined to separate shells in phase space. Furthermore, the
distribution enables us to determine the eigenvalue spectra of the Jacobian at
the fixed points. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the velocity of the dynamics is
strongly correlated with the direction imposed by the nearest fixed point
despite the spatial separation. We propose that this influence of the fixed
points is mediated by tangentially fixed lines.

<h3>Ensuring thermodynamic consistency with invertible coarse-graining</h3>

Coarse-grained models are a core computational tool in theoretical chemistry
and biophysics. A judicious choice of a coarse-grained model can yield physical
insight by isolating the essential degrees of freedom that dictate the
thermodynamic properties of a complex, condensed-phase system. The reduced
complexity of the model typically leads to lower computational costs and more
efficient sampling compared to atomistic models. Designing ``good''
coarse-grained models is an art. Generally, the mapping from fine-grained
configurations to coarse-grained configurations itself is not optimized in any
way; instead, the energy function associated with the mapped configurations is.
In this work, we explore the consequences of optimizing the coarse-grained
representation alongside its potential energy function. We use a graph machine
learning framework to embed atomic configurations into a low dimensional space
to produce efficient representations of the original molecular system. Because
the representation we obtain is no longer directly interpretable as a real
space representation of the atomic coordinates, we also introduce an inversion
process and an associated thermodynamic consistency relation that allows us to
rigorously sample fine-grained configurations conditioned on the coarse-grained
sampling. We show that this technique is robust, recovering the first two
moments of the distribution of several observables in proteins such as
chignolin and alanine dipeptide.

Kitaev's toric code is constructed using a finite gauge group from gauge
theory. Such gauge theories can be generalized with the gauge group generalized
to any finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra. This also leads to
generalizations of the toric code. Here we consider the simple case where the
gauge group is unchanged but furnished with a non-trivial quasitriangular
structure (R-matrix), which modifies the construction of the gauge theory. This
leads to some interesting phenomena; for example, the space of functions on the
group becomes a non-commutative algebra. We also obtain simple Hamiltonian
models generalizing the toric code, which are of the same overall topological
type as the toric code, except that the various species of particles created by
string operators in the model are permuted in a way that depends on the
R-matrix. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ gauge theory, we find that the
introduction of a non-trivial R-matrix amounts to flux attachment.

<br>
The moir\'e pattern induced by lattice mismatch in transition-metal
dichalcogenide heterobilayers causes the formation of flat bands, where
interactions dominate the kinetic energy. At fractional fillings of the flat
valence band, the long-range electron interactions then induce Wigner-Mott
crystals. In this Letter we investigate the nontrivial electronic phases
appearing away from commensurate fillings. Here, competing phases arise that
are either characterized as doped Wigner-Mott charge transfer insulators or
alternatively, a novel state with frozen charge order yet is conducting: the
'electron slush'. We propose that an extremely spatially inhomogeneous local
density of states can serve as a key signature of the electron slush.

In this work, we approximate the surface photovoltage (SPV) transients in
nm-sized ZnO films by the equivalent RC circuit model. The SPV rises in time in
time for about 90 mcs after the exciting light pulse at 275 nm is off at
different pulse widths ranging from 1.2 to 12 mcs. The key to this observation
is a considerable amount of defects in the films, which form a trap capacitance
in the equivalent circuit. The photogeneration of nonequilibrium electrons and
holes near the film surface is described by charging of a capacitance by the
current source whereas the rate of their spatial separation is determined by a
resistance. This resistance reflects an obstacle in the carrier movement while
another capacitance determines the charge separation distance. The
electron-hole recombination is account for a second resistance introduced into
the equivalent circuit. The resulting modeled SPV transient allows to reproduce
the observed experimental curve rather well.

Speculation is provided on how infrastructure choices fit into the materials

discovery of phase-change materials with properties tailored for phase-change

<h3>Properties of packings and dispersions of superellipse sector particles</h3>

Superellipse sector particles (SeSPs) are segments of superelliptical curves
that form a tunable set of hard-particle shapes for granular and colloidal
systems. SeSPs allow for continuous parameterization of corner sharpness,
aspect ratio, and particle curvature; rods, circles, rectangles, and staples
are examples of shapes SeSPs can model. We compare three computational
processes: pair-wise Monte Carlo simulations that look only at
particle-particle geometric constraints, Monte Carlo simulations that look at
how these geometric constraints play out over extended dispersions of many
particles, and Molecular Dynamics simulations that allow particles to interact
to form random loose and close packings. We investigate the dependence of
critical random loose and close packing fractions on particle parameters,
finding that both values tend to increase with opening aperture (as expected)
and, in general, decrease with increasing corner sharpness. The identified
packing fractions are compared with the mean-field prediction of the Random
Contact Model. We find deviations from the model's prediction due to
correlations between particle orientations. The complex interaction of spatial
proximity and orientational alignment is explored using a generalized
Spatio-Orientational Distribution Area (SODA) plot. Higher density packings are
achieved through particles assuming a small number of preferred configurations
which depend sensitively on particle shape and system preparation.

<h3>Spectral and steady-state properties of fermionic random quadratic  Liouvillians</h3>

We study spectral and steady-state properties of generic Markovian
dissipative systems described by quadratic fermionic Liouvillian operators of
the Lindblad form. The Hamiltonian dynamics is modeled by a generic random
quadratic operator, i.e., as a featureless superconductor of class D, whereas
the Markovian dissipation is described by $M$ random linear jump operators. By
varying the dissipation strength and the ratio of dissipative channels per
fermion, $m=M/(2N_F)$, we find two distinct phases where the support of the
single-particle spectrum has one or two connected components. In the strongly
dissipative regime, this transition occurs for $m=1/2$ and is concomitant with
a qualitative change in both the steady-state and the spectral gap that rules
the large-time dynamics. Above this threshold, the spectral gap and the
steady-state purity qualitatively agree with the fully generic (i.e.,
non-quadratic) case studied recently. Below $m=1/2$, the spectral gap closes in
the thermodynamic limit and the steady-state decouples into an ergodic and a
nonergodic sector yielding a non-monotonic steady-state purity as a function of
the dissipation strength. Our results show that some of the universal features
previously observed for fully random Liouvillians are generic for a
sufficiently large number of jump operators. On the other hand, if the number
of dissipation channels is decreased the system can exhibit nonergodic
features, rendering it possible to suppress dissipation in protected subspaces
even in the presence of strong system-environment coupling.

<h3>Growth of a flexible fibre in a deformable ring</h3>

We study the equilibrium configurations related to the growth of an elastic
fibre in a confining flexible ring. This system represents a paradigm for a
variety of biological, medical, and engineering problems. We consider a
simplified geometry in which initially the container is a circular ring of
radius $R$. Quasi-static growth is then studied by solving the equilibrium
equations as the fibre length $l$ increases, starting from $l = 2R$.
Considering both the fibre and the ring as inextensible and unshearable, we
find that beyond a critical length, which depends on the relative bending
stiffness, the fibre buckles. Furthermore, as the fibre grows further it folds,
distorting the ring until it induces a break in mirror symmetry at $l>2 \pi R$.
We get that the equilibrium shapes depend only on two dimensionless parameters:
the length ratio $\mu = l/R$ and the bending stiffnesses ratio $\kappa$. These
findings are also supported by finite element simulation. Finally we
experimentally validate the theoretical results showing a very good
quantitative prediction of the observed buckling and folding regimes at
variable geometrical parameters.

<br>
We investigated the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate of
exciton-polaritons in a nanoribbon of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),
such as MoSe2, embedded in a microcavity in the presence of an external
periodic potential. We have shown that the system exhibits signs of a time
crystalline phase. We have demonstrated that this phase prevails even as the
width of this ribbon is increased to infinity. This was demonstrated by the
fact that the calculated polariton spatial density profile is characterized by
self-sustained oscillations over time. This polariton density profile was
calculated by solving the quantum Lindblad master equation for the density
matrix within the mean field approximation. We also go beyond mean-field and
consider the first-order correction due to the addition of quantum noise and
show that our results still hold even in this regime. This novel time crystal
(TC) has the advantage of being, in principle, achievable even at
room-temperature.

<br>
The conformal anomaly indicates the breaking of conformal symmetry
(angle-preserving transformations) in the quantum theory by quantum
fluctuations and is a close cousin of the gravitational anomaly. We show, for
the first time, that the conformal anomaly controls the variance of the local
magnetization $M_{loc}$ at finite temperatures in spin chains and spin ladders.
This effect is perceived at constant and variable temperature across the
sample. The change of $M_{loc}$ induced by the conformal anomaly is of the
order of 3-5\% of the maximal spin at one Kelvin for DIMPY or CuPzN and
increases linearly with temperature. Further, for a temperature gradient of
10\% across the sample, the time-relaxation of the non-equilibrium $M_{loc}$ is
of the order of nanoseconds. Thus, we believe that experimental techniques such
as neutron scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance~(NMR), spin noise and
ultrafast laser pumping should pinpoint the presence of the conformal anomaly.
Therefore, we pave the road to detect the conformal anomaly in spin observables
of strongly interacting low-dimensional magnets.

Photovoltaics has two main processes: Optical absorption and power
conversion. In photosynthesis, the two equivalent processes are optical
absorption and chemical conversion. Whereas in the latter, the two processes
are carried out by distinct proteins, in conventional photovoltaic diodes, the
two processes are convoluted because the optical and transport paths are the
same, leading to inefficiencies. Here, we separate the site and direction of
light absorption from those of power generation to show that semiconducting
single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) provide an artificial system that
models photosynthesis in a tandem geometry. Using different s-SWCNT
chiralities, we implement an energy funnel in dual-gated p-n diodes. This
enables the capture of photons from multiple regions of the solar spectrum and
the funneling of photogenerated excitons to the smallest bandgap s-SWCNT layer,
where they become free carriers. As a result, we demonstrate an increase in the
magnitude and spectral response of photocurrent by adding more s-SWCNT layers
of different bandgaps without a corresponding deleterious increase in the dark
leakage current.

We present a scheme to use physical Majorana quasi-zero modes at each
junction of a two-dimensional nanowire network to build a logical Majorana zero
mode, the location of which is controllable through gate voltages. The
wire-network is a way to realize a proposal by Yang et al. arXiv:1808.04825 to
imprint a Kekul\'e vortex pattern on a honeycomb lattice via gate voltages. We
show that a specific type of junction -- other than a naive Y- or T-junction --
is needed to realize, without breaking time-reversal symmetry, an artificial
``graphene'' system with Majorana fermions instead of complex ones at each
site. The junction we propose (i) traps exactly one physical Majorana
(quasi-)zero mode at each site of either a brick wall or honeycomb lattice and
(ii) allows this mode to hybridize with all three neighboring sites. Using a
lattice of these junctions and starting from an electronic, tight-binding model
for the wires, we imprint the voltage patterns corresponding to the Kekul\'e
vortex and observe the emergence of the logical Majorana zero mode at the
vortex core. We also provide the range of parameters where this excitation
could be realized experimentally.

We present a perturbative approach to a broad class of disordered systems in
one spatial dimension. Considering a long chain of identically disordered
scatterers, we expand in the reflection strength of any individual scatterer.
This expansion accesses the full range of phase disorder from weak to strong.
As an example application, we show analytically that in a discrete-time quantum
walk, the localization length can depend non-monotonically on the strength of
phase disorder (whereas expanding in weak disorder yields monotonic decrease).
Returning to the general case, we obtain to all orders in the expansion a
particular non-separable form for the joint probability distribution of the
log-transmission and reflection phase. Furthermore, we show that for weak local
reflection strength, a version of the scaling theory of localization holds: the
joint distribution is determined by just three parameters.
