<h3>Defect turbulence in a dense suspension of polar, active swimmers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15197" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15197</a>
<br>
<i>Navdeep Rana, Rayan Chatterjee, Sunghan Ro, Dov Levine, Sriram Ramaswamy, Prasad Perlekar</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of inertia in dense suspensions of polar swimmers. The
hydrodynamic velocity field and the polar order parameter field describe the
dynamics of the suspension. We show that a dimensionless parameter $R$ (ratio
of the swimmer self-advection speed to the active stress invasion speed)
controls the stability of an ordered swimmer suspension. For $R$ smaller than a
threshold $R_1$, perturbations grow at a rate proportional to their wave number
$q$. Beyond $R_1$, we show that the growth rate is $\mathcal{O}(q^2)$ until a
second threshold $R=R_2$ is reached. The suspension is stable for $R>R_2$. We
perform direct numerical simulations to investigate the steady state properties
and observe defect turbulence for $R<R_2$. An investigation of the spatial
organisation of defects unravels a hidden transition: for small $R\approx 0$
defects are uniformly distributed and cluster as $R\to R_1$. Beyond $R_1$,
clustering saturates and defects are arranged in nearly string-like structures.

<h3>Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem in Fluids with Odd Viscosity</h3>

<i>Yuto Hosaka, Ramin Golestanian, Andrej Vilfan</i>
<br>
<br>
The Lorentz reciprocal theorem -- that is used to study various transport
phenomena in hydrodynamics -- is violated in chiral active fluids that feature
odd viscosity with broken time-reversal and parity symmetries. Here we show
that the theorem can be generalized to fluids with odd viscosity by choosing an
auxiliary problem with the opposite sign of the odd viscosity. We demonstrate
the application of the theorem to two categories of microswimmers. Swimmers
with prescribed surface velocity are not affected by odd viscosity, while those
with prescribed active forces are. In particular, a torque-dipole can lead to
directed motion.

<h3>Anatomy of the fragmented Hilbert space: eigenvalue tunneling, quantum  scars and localization in the perturbed random regular graph</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14416" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14416</a>
<br>
<i>Daniil Kochergin, Ivan M. Khaymovich, Olga Valba, Alexander Gorsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the properties of the random regular graph with node degree $d$
perturbed by chemical potentials $\mu_k$ for a number of short $k$-cycles. We
analyze both numerically and analytically the phase diagram of the model in the
$(\mu_k,d)$ plane. The critical curve separating the homogeneous and
clusterized phases is found and it is demonstrated that the clusterized phase
itself generically is separated as the function of $d$ into the phase with
ideal clusters and phase with coupled ones when the continuous spectrum gets
formed. The eigenstate spatial structure of the model is investigated and it is
found that there are localized scar-like states in the delocalized part of the
spectrum, that are related to the topologically equivalent nodes in the graph.
We also reconsider the localization of the states in the non-perturbative band
formed by eigenvalue instantons and find the semi-Poisson level spacing
distribution. The Anderson transition for the case of combined ($k$-cycle)
structural and diagonal (Anderson) disorders is investigated. It is found that
the critical diagonal disorder gets reduced sharply at the clusterization phase
transition, but does it unevenly in non-perturbative and mid-spectrum bands,
due to the scars, present in the latter. The applications of our findings to
$2$d quantum gravity are discussed.

<h3>Identifying non-Abelian anyons with upstream noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14422" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14422</a>
<br>
<i>Misha Yutushui, David F. Mross</i>
<br>
<br>
Non-Abelian phases are among the most highly-prized but elusive states of
matter. We show that upstream noise measurements can identify the putative
non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall plateaus at filling factors
$\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ or in any half-filled Landau level. Interfacing these states
with any readily-available Abelian state yields a binary outcome of upstream
noise or no noise. Judicious choices of the Abelian states can produce a
sequence of yes--no outcomes that fingerprint the possible non-Abelian phase by
ruling out its competitors.

<h3>Chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene realized in a monolayer</h3>

<br>
We demonstrate that a single layer of graphene subject to a superlattice
potential nearly commensurate to a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ supercell exactly
maps to the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene, albeit with half as many
degrees of freedom. We comprehensively review the properties of this
``half-chiral model,'' including the interacting phases stabilized at integer
fillings and the effects of substrate-induced symmetry breaking. We list
candidate substrates that could produce a superlattice potential on graphene
with the correct periodicity to access the flat band limit. Experimental
measurements on a half-chiral moire heterostructure, in which valley-skyrmions
cannot form, could yield insights on the physics they mediate in twisted
bilayer graphene.

<h3>Nano-Patterned Magnetic Edges in CrGeTe3 for Quasi 1-D Spintronic  Devices</h3>

<br>
The synthesis of two-dimensional van der Waals magnets has paved the way for
both technological applications and fundamental research on magnetism confined
to ultra-small length scales. Edge magnetic moments in ferromagnets are
expected to be less magnetized than in the sample interior because of the
reduced amount of neighboring ferromagnetic spins at the sample edge. We
recently demonstrated that CrGeTe3 (CGT) flakes thinner than 10 nm are hard
ferromagnets; i.e., they exhibit an open hysteresis loop. In contrast, thicker
flakes exhibit zero net remnant field in the interior, with hard ferromagnetism
present only at the cleaved edges. This experimental observation suggests that
a nontrivial interaction exists between the sample edge and the interior. Here,
we demonstrate that artificial edges fabricated by focus ion beam etching also
display hard ferromagnetism. This enables us to write magnetic nanowires in CGT
directly and use this method to characterize the magnetic interaction between
the interior and edge. The results indicate that the interior saturation and
depolarization fields depend on the lateral dimensions of the sample. Most
notably, the interior region between the edges of a sample narrower than 300 nm
becomes a hard ferromagnet, suggesting an enhancement of the magnetic exchange
induced by the proximity of the edges. Last, we find that the CGT regions
amorphized by the gallium beam are nonmagnetic, which introduces a novel method
to tune the local magnetic properties of CGT films, potentially enabling
integration into spintronic devices.

<h3>Spin and Charge Fluctuation Induced Pairing in ABCB Tetralayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14438" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14438</a>
<br>
<i>Ammon Fischer, Lennart Klebl, Jonas B. Hauck, Alexander Rothstein, Lutz Waldecker, Bernd Beschoten, Tim O. Wehling, Dante M. Kennes</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent experimental realization of ABCB stacked tetralayer
graphene [Wirth et al., ACS Nano 16, 16617 (2022)], we study correlated
phenomena in moir\'e-less graphene tetralayers for realistic interaction
profiles using an orbital resolved random phase approximation approach. We
demonstrate that magnetic fluctuations originating from local interactions are
crucial close to the van Hove singularities on the electron- and hole-doped
side promoting layer selective ferrimagnetic states. Spin fluctuations around
these magnetic states enhance unconventional spin-triplet, valley-singlet
superconductivity with $f$-wave symmetry due to intervalley scattering. Charge
fluctuations arising from long range Coulomb interactions promote doubly
degenerate $p$-wave superconductivity close to the van Hove singularities. At
the conduction band edge of ABCB graphene, we find that both spin and charge
fluctuations drive $f$-wave superconductivity. Our analysis suggests a strong
competition between superconducting states emerging from long- and short-ranged
Coulomb interactions and thus stresses the importance of microscopically
derived interaction profiles to make reliable predictions for the origin of
superconductivity in graphene based heterostructures.

<h3>Terahertz Circular Dichroism in Commensurate Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14472</a>
<br>
<i>Spenser Talkington, Eugene J. Mele</i>
<br>
<br>
We report calculations of terahertz ellipticities in large-angle,
21.79$^\circ$ and 38.21$^\circ$, commensurate twisted bilayer graphene, and
predict values as high as 1.5 millidegrees in the terahertz region for this
non-magnetic material. This terahertz circular dichroism exhibits a magnitude
comparable to that of chiral materials in the visible region. At low
frequencies, the dichroic response is mediated by strong interlayer
hybridization, which allows us to probe the symmetry and strength of these
couplings. Crucially, lateral interlayer translation tunes this response, in
contrast to small twist angle bilayer graphene's near invariance under under
interlayer translation. We examine the magnitude and phase of the interlayer
coupling for all structures containing fewer than 400 atoms per unit cell.
Finally, we find that the dichroism can be manipulated by applying an electric
field or with doping.

<h3>On the size of superconducting islands on the density-wave background in  organic metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14510</a>

Most high-$T_c$ superconductors are spatially inhomogeneous. Usually, this
heterogeneity originates from the interplay of various types of electronic
ordering. It affects various superconducting properties, such as the transition
temperature, magnetic upper critical field, critical current, etc. In this
paper we analyze the parameters of spatial phase segregation during the
first-order transition between superconductivity (SC) and a charge- or
spin-density wave state in quasi-one-dimensional metals with imperfect nesting,
typical to organic superconductors. An external pressure or another driving
parameter increases the transfer integrals in electron dispersion, which only
slightly affects SC but violates the Fermi-surface nesting and suppresses the
density wave (DW). At a critical pressure $P_{c}$ the transition from DW to SC
occurs. We estimate the characteristic size of SC islands during this phase
transition in organic metals in two ways. Using the Ginzburg-Landau expansion
we analytically obtain a lower bound for the size of SC domains. To estimate
more specific interval of possible size of the SC islands in (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$
samples we perform numerical calculations of the percolation probability via SC
domains and compare it with experimental resistivity data. This helps to
develop a consistent microscopic description of SC spatial heterogeneity in
various organic superconductors.

<h3>Effects of Temperature Fluctuations on Charge Noise in Quantum Dot  Qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14515" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14515</a>
<br>
<i>Dan Mickelsen, Herve M. Carruzzo, Susan N. Coppersmith, Clare C. Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
Silicon quantum dot qubits show great promise but suffer from charge noise
with a 1/f^\alpha spectrum, where f is frequency and \alpha \lesssim 1. It has
recently been proposed that 1/f^\alpha noise spectra can emerge from a few
thermally activated two-level fluctuators in the presence of sub-bath
temperature fluctuations associated with a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG)~\cite{Ahn2021}. We investigate this proposal by doing Monte Carlo
simulations of a single Ising spin in a bath with a fluctuating temperature. We
find that to obtain noise with a $1/f^\alpha$ spectrum with $alpha \lesssim 1
down to low frequencies, the duration of temperature fluctuations must be
comparable to the inverse of the lowest frequency at which the noise is
measured. This result is consistent with an analytic calculation in which the
fluctuator is a two-state system with dynamics governed by time-dependent
switching rates. In this case we find that the noise spectrum follows a
Lorentzian at frequencies lower than the inverse of the average duration of the
lowest switching rate. We then estimate relaxation times of thermal
fluctuations by considering thermal diffusion in an electron gas in a confined
geometry. We conclude that temperature fluctuations in a 2DEG sub-bath would
require an unphysically long duration to be consistent with experimental
measurements of 1/f-like charge noise in quantum dots at frequencies extending
well below 1 Hz.

<h3>Berry Curvature and Topological Hall Effect in Magnetic Nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14519</a>
<br>
<i>Ahsan Ullah, Balamurugan Balasubramanian, Bibek Tiwari, Bharat Giri, David J. Sellmyer, Ralph Skomski, Xiaoshan Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
Analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations are used to determine
the Berry curvature and topological Hall effect (THE) due to conduction
electrons in small ferromagnetic particles. Our focus is on small particles of
nonellipsoidal shapes, where noncoplanar spin structures yield a nonzero
topological Hall signal quantified by the skyrmion number Q. We consider two
mechanisms leading to noncoplanarity in aligned nanoparticles, namely
flower-state spin configurations due to stray fields near corners and edges,
and curling-type magnetostatic selfinteractions. In very small particles, the
reverse magnetic fields enhance Q due to the flower state until the reversal
occurs, whereas for particles with a radius greater than coherence radius Rcoh
the Q jumps to a larger value at the nucleation field representing the
transition from the flower state to the curling state. We calculate the
Skyrmion density (average Berry curvature) from these spin structures as a
function of particle size and applied magnetic field. Our simulation results
agree with analytical calculations for both flower state and flux closure
states. We showed the presence of Berry curvature in small particles as long as
the size of the particle is less than the single domain limit. Using magnetic
force microscopy (MFM), we also showed that in a nanodot of Co with a suitable
size, a magnetic vortex state with perpendicular (turned-up) magnetization at
the core is realized which can be manifested for Berry curvature and emergent
magnetic field in confined geometries for single domain state at room
temperature.

<h3>Cusp singularities in the distribution of orientations of  asymmetrically-pivoted hard discs on a lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14530" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14530</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We study a system of equal-sized circular discs each with an asymmetrically
placed pivot at a fixed distance from the center. The pivots are fixed at the
vertices of a regular triangular lattice. The discs can rotate freely about the
pivots, with the constraint that no discs can overlap with each other. Our
Monte Carlo simulations show that the one-point probability distribution of
orientations shows multiple cusp-like singularities. We determine the exact
positions and qualitative behavior of these singularities. In addition to these
geometrical singularities, we also find that the system shows order-disorder
transitions, with a disordered phase at large lattice spacings, a phase with
spontaneously broken orientational lattice symmetry at small lattice spacings,
and an intervening Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase in between.

<h3>Berry Curvature Spectroscopy from Bloch Oscillations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14532" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14532</a>
<br>
<i>Christophe De Beule, E. J. Mele</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that the Berry curvature of an isolated Bloch miniband in
two-dimensional superlattices can be probed by the dressed linear optical
response when a uniform static field is applied to the system. In particular,
when the static field is sufficiently strong such that full Bloch oscillations
occur before the crystal momentum relaxes to equilibrium, the optical response
of the dressed system becomes resonant at the Bloch frequencies. The latter are
in the THz regime when the superlattice periodicity is of the order of 10 nm.
Using a band-projected semiclassical theory, we define a dressed optical
conductivity and find that the height of the resonances in the dressed Hall
conductivity are proportional to the Fourier components of the Berry curvature.
We illustrate our results with a low-energy model on an effective honeycomb
lattice.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) remain a topic
of immense interest. Specifically, given their low operational switching costs,
they find many niche applications in new computing architectures with the
promise of continued miniaturization. However, challenges lie in Back End of
Line (BEOL) integration temperature and time compliance regarding current
requirements for crystal growth. Additionally, deleterious and time-consuming
transfer processes and multiple steps involved in channel/contact engineering
can cripple device performance. This work demonstrates kinetics-governed
in-situ growth regimes (surface or edge growth from gold) of WSe2 and provides
a mechanistic understanding of these regimes via energetics across various
material interfaces. As a proof-of-concept, field effect transistors (FET) with
an in-situ grown WSe2 channel across Au contacts are fabricated, demonstrating
a 2D semiconductor transistor via a transfer-free method within the 450-600 C
2h-time window requirement BEOL integration. We leverage directional edge
growth to fabricate contacts with robust thickness-dependent Schottky-to-Ohmic
behavior. By transitioning between Au and SiO2 growth substrates in situ, this
work achieves strain-induced subthreshold swing of 140 mV/decade, relatively
high mobility of 107 +- 19 cm2V-1s-1, and robust ON/OFF ratios 10^6 in the
fabricated FETs.

<h3>Statistical mechanics of nanotubes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14602" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14602</a>
<br>
<i>Siddhartha Sarkar, Mohamed El Hedi Bahri, Andrej Košmrlj</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the mechanical
properties of nanotubes by employing tools from statistical physics. For 2D
sheets it was previously shown that thermal fluctuations effectively
renormalize elastic moduli beyond a characteristic temperature-dependent
thermal length scale (a few nanometers for graphene at room temperature), where
the bending rigidity increases, while the in-plane elastic moduli reduce in a
scale-dependent fashion with universal power law exponents. However, the
curvature of nanotubes produces new phenomena. In nanotubes, competition
between stretching and bending costs associated with radial fluctuations
introduces a characteristic elastic length scale, which is proportional to the
geometric mean of the radius and effective thickness. Beyond elastic length
scale, we find that the in-plane elastic moduli stop renormalizing in the axial
direction, while they continue to renormalize in the circumferential direction
beyond the elastic length scale albeit with different universal exponents. The
bending rigidity, however, stops renormalizing in the circumferential direction
at the elastic length scale. These results were verified using molecular
dynamics simulations.

<h3>Field-direction-dependent skyrmion crystals in noncentrosymmetric cubic  magnets: A comparison between point groups $(O,T)$ and $T_{\rm d}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14619" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14619</a>
<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami, Ryota Yambe</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the instability toward a skyrmion crystal (SkX) in
noncentrosymmetric cubic magnets with an emphasis on a comparison between point
groups $(O,T)$ and $T_{\rm d}$. By constructing low-temperature magnetic phase
diagrams under an external magnetic field for three directions based on
numerically simulated annealing, we find that the system under the point group
$(O,T)$ exhibits different two types of SkXs depending on the field direction,
while that under $T_{\rm d}$ does not show such an instability. The difference
between them is understood from the difference in the momentum-dependent
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under each point group. Meanwhile, we show
that the system under $T_{\rm d}$ leads to the SkX instability by considering
an additional effect of the uniaxial strain, which lowers the symmetry to
$D_{\rm 2d}$. We obtain two different SkXs: N\'eel-type and anti-type SkXs, the
former of which is stabilized in the presence of the interactions at the
three-dimensional ordering wave vectors. The present results provide rich
topological spin textures in the three-dimensional systems, which are sensitive
to the magnetic-field direction and point-group symmetry.

This is the second and the final part of the review on density functional
theory (DFT), referred to as DFT-II. In the first review, DFT-I, we have
discussed wavefunction-based methods, their complexity, and the basic of
density functional theory. In DFT-II, we focus on fundamentals of DFT and their
implications for the betterment of the theory. We start our presentation with
the exact DFT result followed by the concept of exchange-correlation (xc) or
Fermi-Coulomb hole and its relation with xc energy functional. We also provide
the exact conditions for the xc-hole, xc-energy and xc-potential along with
their physical interpretation. Next, we describe the extension of DFT for
non-integer numbers of electrons, the piecewise linearity of total energy and
discontinuity of chemical potential at integer particle numbers, and derivative
discontinuity of the xc potential, which has consequences on fundamental gap of
solids. After that, we present how one obtain more accurate xc energy
functionals by going beyond LDA. We discuss the gradient expansion
approximation (GEA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and hybrid
functional approaches to designing better xc energy functionals that give
accurate total energies but fail to predict properties like the ionization
potential and the band gap. Thus, we describe different methods of modeling
these potentials and the results of their application for the calculation of
the band gaps of different solids to highlight accuracy of different xc
potential. Finally, we conclude with a glimpse on orbital-free density
functional theory and the machine learning approach .

This article is part-I of a review of density-functional theory (DFT) that is
the most widely used method for calculating electronic structure of materials.
The accuracy and ease of numerical implementation of DFT methods has resulted
in its extensive use for materials design and discovery and has thus ushered in
the new field of computational material science. In this article we start with
an introduction to Schr\"odinger equation and methods of its solutions. After
presenting exact results for some well-known systems, difficulties encountered
in solving the equation for interacting electrons are described. How these
difficulties are handled using the variational principle for the energy to
obtain approximate solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation is discussed. The
resulting Hartree and Hartree-Fock theories are presented along with results
they give for atomic and solid-state systems. We then describe Thomas-Fermi
theory and its extensions which were the initial attempts to formulate
many-electron problem in terms of electronic density of a system. Having
described these theories, we introduce modern density functional theory by
discussing Hohenberg-Kohn theorems that form its foundations. We then go on to
discuss Kohn-Sham formulation of density-functional theory in its exact form.
Next, local density approximation is introduced and solutions of Kohn-Sham
equation for some representative systems, obtained using the local density
approximation, are presented. We end part-I of the review describing the
contents of part-II.

We study the motion of a heavy impurity immersed in a weakly interacting BEC
using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPe). We construct a perturbative solution
to the GPe in powers of impurity velocity in the case when the boson-impurity
potential is tuned to unitarity and calculate the effective mass of the
polaron. In addition, we calculate the interaction energy of two unitary
polarons which are sufficiently far apart. Our formalism also reproduces the
results for both the mass and interaction energy obtained at weak
boson-impurity coupling.

Compared with adjacent microwaves and infrared frequencies, terahertz (THz)
frequency offers numerous advantages for imaging applications. The unique THz
spectral signatures of chemicals allow the development of THz imaging systems
for nondestructive tests and the evaluation of biological objects, materials,
components, circuits, and systems, which are especially useful in the security,
medical, material, pharmaceutical, aeronautical, and electronics industries.
However, technological advancements have been hindered owing to the lack of
power-efficient and compact THz sources. Here, we use high-temperature
superconducting monolithic sources known as Josephson plasma emitters
(JPEs)-which are compact, chip-integrated coherent and monochromatic sources of
broadly tunable THz waves-and report the art of non-destructive imaging of
concealed metallic surgical blades, floppy disks, dandelion leaves, and slices
of pork meat in the THz spectral range. The quality of the images, exhibiting
high-contrast differentiation between metallic and non-metallic parts, making
different features of objects visible, and targeting different powders,
demonstrates the viability of this THz imaging system for nondestructive,
contactless, quick, and accurate environmental monitoring, security, medicine,
materials, and quantum science and technology applications.

<br>
<br>
We report on the interplay of two uniaxial magnetic anisotropies in epitaxial
Fe thin films of varying thickness grown on InAs(001) as observed in
ferromagnetic resonance experiments. One anisotropy originates from the Fe/InAs
interface while the other originates from in-plane shear strain resulting from
the anisotropic relaxation of the Fe film. X-ray diffraction was used to
measure the in-plane lattice constants of the Fe films, confirming the
correlation between the onset of film relaxation and the corresponding shear
strain inferred from ferromagnetic resonance data. These results are relevant
for ongoing efforts to develop spintronic and quantum devices utilizing large
spin-orbit coupling in III-V semiconductors.

<h3>Pairing interactions induce antiferromagnetism in cuprate  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14665" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14665</a>
<br>
<i>Kuan-Ming Hung, Tung-Ho Shieh</i>
<br>
<br>
In cuprate superconductors, superconductivity is consistently accompanied by
antiferromagnetism. This raises the question of a potential causal link between
superconductivity and antiferromagnetic mechanisms. In this study, we consider
the non-local Coulomb interaction and solve the single-particle Green function
exactly. The exact solution shows the existence of strong inter-spin
correlations in the absence of superexchange, eliminating the directional
degrees of freedom for spin quantization in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model.
Strong Coulomb interactions force the energy band splitting into infinitely
equidistant sub-bands weighted by a Poisson distribution, exhibiting boson
properties (incoherent pairs of fermions) and non-Fermi liquids. Attractive
pairing interactions caused by electron-phonon coupling open a pairing gap at
the Fermi surface. Based on the Pauli exclusion principle, paired particles
with the same spin quantization direction completely occupy the state below the
gap, resulting in pairing insulators, superconducting instability, and
especially antiferromagnetism. A pseudogap occurs when the higher split
sub-band overlaps in energy with the lowest sub-band. The critical temperature
Tc of superconductivity exhibits a multi-dome structure and peaks around the
maximum density of states. The maximum Tc depends on splitting sub-bands and
particle occupancy, consistent with experiments. This study concludes that the
non-local effect preserves the Hubbard and HK models' characteristics while
renormalizing the system to antiferromagnetism in pairing insulators and Pauli
paramagnetism in weak semimetals.

<h3>Scattering Evidence of Positional Charge Correlations in Polyelectrolyte  Complexes</h3>

Polyelectrolyte complexation plays an important role in materials science and
biology. The internal structure of the resultant polyelectrolyte complex (PEC)
phase dictates properties such as physical state, response to external stimuli,
and dynamics. Small-angle scattering experiments with X-rays and neutrons have
revealed structural similarities between PECs and semidilute solutions of
neutral polymers, where the total scattering function exhibits an
Ornstein-Zernike form. In spite of consensus among different theoretical
predictions, the existence of positional correlations between polyanion and
polycation charges has not been confirmed experimentally. Here, we present
small-angle neutron scattering profiles where the polycation scattering length
density is matched to that of the solvent to extract positional correlations
among anionic monomers. The polyanion scattering functions exhibit a peak at
the inverse polymer screening radius of Coulomb interactions, $q^{*} \approx
0.2 {\AA}^{-1}$. This peak, attributed to Coulomb repulsions between the
fragments of polyanions and their attractions to polycations, is even more
pronounced in the calculated charge scattering function that quantifies
positional correlations of all polymer charges within the PEC. Screening of
electrostatic interactions by adding salt leads to the gradual disappearance of
this correlation peak, and the scattering functions regain an Ornstein-Zernike
form. Experimental scattering results are consistent with those calculated from
the random phase approximation, a scaling analysis, and molecular simulations.

<h3>Faraday Waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates -- The Excitation by the  Modulation of the Interaction and the Potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14729" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14729</a>
<br>
<i>Nobuyuki Shukuno, Yuto Sano, Makoto Tsubota</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically study the dynamics of Faraday waves for Bose-Einstein
condensates(BECs) trapped by anisotropic potentials using the three-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In previous studies, Faraday waves were excited by
periodic modulation of the interaction or potential; in contrast, this study
systematically addresses the excitations of the two methods. When the
interaction is modulated with a modulation frequency resonant with Faraday
waves, the breathing mode along the tight confinement direction is excited, and
the Faraday waves appear in the direction of weak confinement. A modulation
frequency that is not resonant with Faraday waves does not excite Faraday
waves. Thus, the dynamics depend on modulation frequencies. The behavior of the
total energy and its decomposition characterize the dynamics. The excitation of
Faraday waves depends on the anisotropy of the potentials as well; Faraday
waves are excited only for elongated BECs. We compare the differences of the
dynamics in modulation methods. There are no qualitative differences between
the modulation of the interaction and potential. When the interaction and
potential are simultaneously modulated, Faraday waves are excited but they do
not necessarily work additively. To understand this phenomenon as a dynamical
system, we choose a few dynamical variables and follow their trajectory in a
phase space. The trajectory characteristics of Faraday waves and the breathing
mode show that the methods of modulation are not very relevant; determining the
target mode to excite is important.

<h3>Investigation of the atomic coordinates of CeNiC$_2$ under pressure:  switching of the Ce-Ce first nearest neighbor direction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14743</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
When pressurized, the heavy fermion compound CeNiC$_2$ reveals a rich
electronic phase diagram and shows unconventional superconductivity with a
transition temperature $T_c$ $\sim$ 3.7 K, the highest among Ce-based heavy
fermion superconductors [S. Katano et al., Phys. Rev. B. 99, 100501(R) (2019)].
Understanding of this appearance of superconductivity in the vicinity of
magnetic quantum critical point is still lacking. Given that physical
properties of CeNiC$_2$ are sensitive to subtle changes in the interatomic
distances, information on atomic coordinates may offer essential insights into
the local lattice arrangements, thus the mechanisms behind the exotic phases
and phase transitions. However, extraction of precise information on the atomic
coordinates under pressure remains a challenge. To find a correlation between
the local lattice environments and exotic physical properties in CeNiC$_2$, we
investigate its crystal structure from ambient pressure to 18.6 GPa via single
crystal X-ray diffraction. The pressure dependence of lattice parameters
reveals anisotropic linear compressibility, $|\kappa|$, following the
relationship $|\kappa_{a}|$ (3.70$\times$10$^{-3}$ GPa$^{-1}$) $>$
$|\kappa_{c}|$ (1.97$\times$10$^{-3}$ GPa$^{-1}$) $>$ $|\kappa_{b}|$
(1.39$\times$10$^{-3}$ GPa$^{-1}$), and a large bulk modulus, B$_0$ $\sim$ 134
GPa. Although the atomic coordinates between Ce and Ni remain unchanged under
applied pressure, direction of the first nearest and the second nearest
neighbors between both the Ce-Ce and Ni-Ni atoms switch $\sim$ 7 GPa. Notably,
this is the same pressure that antiferromagnetic ordering temperature reaches
maximum in the pressure temperature phase diagram of CeNiC$_2$. Our results
suggest that the direction of nearest neighbors interchange might play a key
role in the suppression of magnetic order and the enhancement of Kondo effect.

We attempt to estimate the spatial distribution of heterogeneous physical
parameters involved in the formation of magnetic domain patterns of
polycrystalline thin films by using convolutional neural networks. We propose a
method to obtain a spatial map of physical parameters by estimating the
parameters from patterns within a small subregion window of the full magnetic
domain and subsequently shifting this window. To enhance the accuracy of
parameter estimation in such subregions, we employ employ large-scale models
utilized for natural image classification and exploit the benefits of
pretraining. Using a model with high estimation accuracy on these subregions,
we conduct inference on simulation data featuring spatially varying parameters
and demonstrate the capability to detect such parameter variations.

<br>
<br>
Using a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) technique, we calculated the phase
diagrams of $^4$He and H$_2$ adsorbed on a single (5,5) carbon nanotube, one of
the narrowest that can be obtained experimentally. For a single monolayer, when
the adsorbate density increases, both species undergo a series of first order
solid-solid phase transitions between incommensurate arrangements. Remarkably,
the $^4$He lowest-density solid phase shows supersolid behavior in contrast
with the normal solid that we found for H$_2$. The nature of the second-layer
is also different for both adsorbates. Contrarily to what happens on graphite,
the second-layer of $^4$He on that tube is a liquid, at least up to the density
corresponding to a third-layer promotion on a flat substrate. However, the
second-layer of H$_2$ is a solid that, at its lowest stable density, has a
small but observable superfluid fraction.

We examined the piezomagnetic effect in an antiferromagnet composed of MnTe,
which is a candidate material for altermagnetism with a high critical
temperature. We observed that the magnetization develops with the application
of stress and revealed that the piezomagnetic coefficient Q is
1.38$\times10^{-8}$ ${\mu}$B/MPa at 300 K. The poling-field dependence of
magnetization indicates that the antiferromagnetic domain can be controlled
using the piezomagnetic effect. We demonstrate that the piezomagnetic effect is
suitable for detecting and controlling the broken time reversal symmetry in
altermagnets.

<br>
Understanding the interplay of interactions and disorder in quantum transport
poses long-standing fundamental challenges for theory and experiment. Despite
remarkable advances using ultracold atomic platforms combining atomic
interactions with spatially disordered lattices, many-body effects on quantum
transport phenomena in high-dimensional disordered systems, such as the
three-dimensional (d = 3) Anderson metal-insulator transition (MIT), have
largely remained unexplored. Here we utilize a momentum space lattice platform
using quasi-periodically kicked ultracold atomic gases as a quantum simulator
to experimentally investigate the role of many-body interactions in the d = 3
Anderson MIT. We observe interaction-driven sub-diffusive delocalization and
find a divergence of the delocalization onset time as kick strength approaches
the many-body phase boundary. By modifying the kick quasi-periodicity, we
demonstrate interaction-driven sub-diffusion in d = 2 and d = 4. Our numerical
simulations using a mean-field treatment exhibit an interaction-induced shift
of the d = 3 transition boundary and many-body delocalization dynamics, that
are both in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. However,
there are significant quantitative deviations between experiment and mean-field
theory which increase with higher interaction strengths, calling for further
study of the underlying many-body physics.

Stochastic restarting is a strategy of starting anew. Incorporation of the
resetting to the random walks can result in the decrease of the mean first
passage time, due to the ability to limit unfavorably meandering, sub-optimal
trajectories. In the following manuscript we examine how stochastic resetting
influences escape dynamics from the $(-\infty,1)$ interval in the presence of
the single-well power-law $|x|^\kappa$ potentials with $\kappa>0$. Examination
of the mean first passage time is complemented by the analysis of the
coefficient of variation, which provides a robust and reliable indicator
assessing efficiency of stochastic resetting. The restrictive nature of
resetting is compared to placing a reflective boundary in the system at hand.
In particular, for each potential, the position of the reflecting barrier
giving the same mean first passage time as the optimal resetting rate is
determined. Finally, in addition to reflecting, we compare effectiveness of
other resetting strategies with respect to optimization of the mean first
passage time.

Magnonics or magnon spintronics is an emerging field focusing on generating,
detecting, and manipulating magnons. As charge-neutral quasi-particles, magnons
are promising information carriers because of their low energy dissipation and
long coherence length. In the past decade, topological phases in magnonics have
attracted intensive attention due to their fundamental importance in
condensed-matter physics and potential applications of spintronic devices. In
this review, we mainly focus on recent progress in topological magnonics, such
as the Hall effect of magnons, magnon Chern insulators, topological magnon
semimetals, etc. In addition, the evidence supporting topological phases in
magnonics and candidate materials are also discussed and summarized. The aim of
this review is to provide readers with a comprehensive and systematic
understanding of the recent developments in topological magnonics.

<br>
<br>
The resonance of the magnetic domain wall under the applied field amplifies
its velocity compared to the one-dimensional model. To quantify the
amplification, we define the distortion variation rate of the domain wall that
can represent how fast and severely the wall shape is variated. Introducing
that rate gives a way to bring the resonance into the one-dimensional domain
wall dynamics model. We obtain the dissipated energy and domain wall velocity
amplification by calculating the distortion variation rate. The relationship
between velocity and distortion variation rate agrees well with micromagnetic
simulation.

<br>
<br>
The scattering theory of low-energy (slow) electrons has been developed by
Evans and Mills [Phys. Rev. B 5, 4126 (1972)]. The formalism is merely based on
the electrostatic Coulomb interaction of the scattering electrons with the
charge-density fluctuations above the surface and can describe most of the
interesting features observed in the high-resolution electron energy-loss
spectroscopy experiments. Here we extend this theory by including the
spin-orbit coupling in the scattering process. We discuss the impact of this
interaction on the scattering cross section. In particular, we discuss cases in
which a spin-polarized electron beam is scattered from nonmagnetic surfaces
with a strong spin-orbit coupling. We show that under some assumptions one can
derive an expression for the scattering cross section, which can be used for
numerical calculations of the spin-polarized spectra recorded by spin-polarized
high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy experiments.

<br>
<br>
The hidden geometry of simplicial complexes can influence the collective
dynamics of nodes in different ways depending on the simplex-based interactions
of various orders and competition between local and global structural features.
We study a system of phase oscillators attached to nodes of 4-dimensional
simplicial complexes and interacting via positive/negative edges-based pairwise
$K_1$ and triangle-based triple $K_2\geq 0$ couplings. Three prototypal
simplicial complexes are grown by aggregation of 5-cliques, controlled by the
chemical affinity parameter $\nu$, resulting in sparse, mixed, and compact
architecture, all of which have 1-hyperbolic graphs but different spectral
dimensions. By changing the interaction strength $K_1\in[-4,2]$ along the
forward and backward sweeps, we numerically determine individual phases of each
oscillator and a global order parameter to measure the level of
synchronisation. Our results reveal how different architectures of simplicial
complexes, in conjunction with the interactions and internal-frequency
distributions, impact the shape of the hysteresis loop and lead to patterns of
locally synchronised groups that hinder global network synchronisation.

<br>
We consider several Hamiltonian systems perturbed by external agents, that
preserve their Hamiltonian structure. We investigate the corrections to the
canonical statistics resulting from coupling such systems with possibly large
but finite reservoirs, and from the onset of processes breaking the time
reversal symmetry. We analyze exactly solvable oscillators systems, and perform
simulations of relatively more complex ones. This indicates that the standard
statistical mechanical formalism needs to be adjusted, in the ever more
investigated nano-scale science and technology. In particular, the hypothesis
that heat reservoirs be considered infinite and be described by the classical
ensembles is found to be critical when exponential quantities are considered,
since the large size limit may not coincide with the infinite size canonical
result. Furthermore, process-dependent emergent irreversibility affects
ensemble averages, effectively frustrating, on a statistical level, the time
reversal invariance of Hamiltonian dynamics, that is used to obtain numerous
results.

We analyze the magneto-optical conductivity (and related magnitudes like
transmittance and Faraday rotation of the irradiated polarized light) of some
elemental two-dimensional Dirac materials of group IV (graphene analogues,
buckled honeycomb lattices, like silicene, germanene, stannane, etc.), group V
(phosphorene), and zincblende heterostructures (like HgTe/CdTe quantum wells)
near the Dirac and gamma points, under out-of-plane magnetic and electric
fields, to characterize topological-band insulator phase transitions and their
critical points. We provide plots of the Faraday angle and transmittance as a
function of the polarized light frequency, for different external electric and
magnetic fields, chemical potential, HgTe layer thickness and temperature, to
tune the material magneto-optical properties. We have shown that
absortance/transmittance acquires extremal values at the critical point, where
the Faraday angle changes sign, thus providing fine markers of the topological
phase transition.

<h3>Defect-Defect Interactions in the Buckling of Imperfect Spherical Shells</h3>

<br>
<br>
We perform finite element simulations to study the impact of defect-defect
interactions on the pressure-induced buckling of thin, elastic, spherical
shells containing two dimpled imperfections. Throughout, we quantify the
critical buckling pressure of these shells using their knockdown factor. We
examine cases featuring either identical or different geometric defects and
systematically explore the parameter space, including the angular separation
between the defects, their widths and amplitudes, and the radius-to-thickness
ratio of the shell. As the angular separation between the defects is increased,
the buckling strength initially decreases, then increases before reaching a
plateau. Our primary finding is that the onset of defect-defect interactions,
as quantified by a characteristic length scale associated with the onset of the
plateau, is set by the critical buckling wavelength reported in the classic
shell-buckling literature. Beyond this threshold, within the plateau regime,
the buckling behavior of the shell is dictated by the largest defect.

Zincblende copper iodide has attracted significant interest as a potential
material for transparent electronics, thanks to its exceptional light
transmission capabilities in the visible range and remarkable hole
conductivity. However, remaining challenges hinder the utilization of copper
iodide's unique properties in real-world applications. To address this,
chalcogen doping has emerged as a viable approach to enhance the hole
concentration in copper iodide. In search of further strategies to improve and
tune the electronic properties of this transparent semiconductor, we
investigate the ternary phase diagram of copper and iodine with sulphur or
selenium by performing structure prediction calculations using the minima
hopping method. As a result, we find 11 structures located on or near the
convex hull, 9 of which are unreported. Based on our band structure
calculations, it appears that sulphur and selenium are promising candidates for
achieving ternary semiconductors suitable as $p$-type transparent conducting
materials. Additionally, our study reveals the presence of unreported phases
that exhibit intriguing topological properties. These findings broaden the
scope of potential applications for these ternary systems, highlighting the
possibility of harnessing their unique electronic characteristics in diverse
electronic devices and systems.

Metal halide perovskite solar cells have gained widespread attention due to
their high efficiency and high defect tolerance. The absorbing perovskite layer
is as a mixed electron-ion conductor that supports high rates of ion and charge
transport at room temperature, but the migration of mobile defects can lead to
degradation pathways. We combine experimental observations and drift-diffusion
modelling to demonstrate a new framework to interpret surface photovoltage
(SPV) measurements in perovskite systems and mixed electronic ionic conductors
more generally. We conclude that the SPV in mixed electronic ionic conductors
can be understood in terms of the change in electric potential at the surface
associated with changes in the net charge within the semiconductor system. We
show that by modifying the interfaces of perovskite bilayers, we may control
defect migration behaviour throughout the perovskite bulk. Our new framework
for SPV has broad implications for developing strategies to improve the
stability of perovskite devices by controlling defect accumulation at
interfaces. More generally, in mixed electronic conductors our framework
provides new insights into the behaviour of mobile defects and their
interaction with photoinduced charges, which are foundational to physical
mechanisms in memristivity, logic, impedance, sensors and energy storage.

<h3>Enhancement of synthetic magnetic field induced nonreciprocity via bound  states in continuum in dissipatively coupled systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
The nonreciprocal propagation of light typically requires use of materials
like ferrites or magneto-optical media with a strong magnetic bias or methods
based on material nonlinearities which require use of strong electromagnetic
fields. A simpler possibility to produce nonreciprocity is to use
spatio-temporal modulations to produce magnetic fields in synthetic dimensions.
In this paper we show that dissipatively coupled systems can lead to
considerable enhancement of nonreciprocity in synthetic fields. The enhancement
comes about from the existence of nearly nondecaying mode -bound state in
continuum (BIC) in dissipatively coupled systems. The dissipative coupling
occurs in a wide class of systems coupled via transmission lines, waveguides,
or nano fibers. The systems could be optical resonators or microscopic qubits.
Remarkably we find that for specific choice of the modulation amplitudes, the
transmission say in forward direction is completely extinguished whereas in the
backward direction it becomes maximum. The synthetic fields produce
transmission resonances which show significant line narrowing which owe their
origin to existence of BIC's in dissipative systems.

Strong electron-electron Coulomb interactions in materials can lead to a vast
range of exotic many-body quantum phenomena, including Mott metal-insulator
transitions, magnetic order, quantum spin liquids, and unconventional
superconductivity. These many-body phases are strongly dependent on band
occupation and can hence be controlled via the chemical potential. Flat
electronic bands in two-dimensional (2D) and layered materials such as the
kagome lattice, enhance strong electronic correlations. Although theoretically
predicted, correlated-electron phases in monolayer 2D metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) - which benefit from efficient synthesis protocols and tunable
properties - with a kagome structure have not yet been realised experimentally.
Here, we synthesise a 2D kagome MOF comprised of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene
molecules and copper atoms on an atomically thin insulator, monolayer hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) on Cu(111). Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and
spectroscopy reveal an electronic energy gap of ~200 meV in this MOF,
consistent with dynamical mean-field theory predictions of a Mott insulating
phase. By tuning the electron population of kagome bands, via either
template-induced (via local work function variations of the hBN/Cu(111)
substrate) or tip-induced (via the STM probe) gating, we are able to induce
Mott metal-insulator transitions in the MOF. These findings pave the way for
devices and technologies based on 2D MOFs and on electrostatic control of
many-body quantum phases therein.

Recent experimental results [Liu and Broer, Nat. Commun. 6 8334 (2015)]
reveal that light-responsive azo-doped liquid crystal polymers under
dual-wavelength illumination exhibit a significant reduction in density. This
reduction in density was attributed to dynamic trans-cis-trans isomerization
cycles. The light-induced isomerization kinetics suggest that the fraction of
isomers undergoing dynamic isomerization increases with the light sources'
intensity. However, experiments have shown that such an increase in intensity
does not result in a monotonic decrease in density. Further, it was observed
that there exists an optimal combination of the intensities of the
dual-wavelength illumination that results in a maximum density reduction. The
exact reason for the existence of such an optimal combination remains elusive.
In this work, we have performed atomistic simulations to confirm the hypothesis
that the density reduction is caused by the dynamic trans-cis-trans
isomerization cycles. Subsequently, the atomistic simulations are used to
decipher the underlying physics responsible for the counter-intuitive relation
between density reduction and intensities. Intensity variations are simulated
by varying the forward and backward isomerization probabilities. The
simulations show that an optimal combination of these two probabilities will
exhibit a maximum density reduction corroborating experimental observations.
Consequently, we discovered that a specific frequency of the dynamic
trans-cis-trans isomerization cycles would induce maximum distortion in the
polymer network resulting in significant density reduction.

The coupling of superconducting systems to mechanical resonators is an
emerging field, with wide reaching implications including high precision
sensing and metrology. Experimental signatures of this coupling have so far
been small, seldom and often reliant on high frequency AC electronics. To
overcome this limitation, in this work we consider a mechanical resonator
suspended between two superconducting contacts to form a suspended Josephson
junction in which the electronic normal- and super-currents can be coupled to
mechanical motion via the Lorentz force due to an external magnetic field. We
show both analytically and numerically that this electro-mechanical coupling
produces unprecedented mechanically-induced hysteresis loops in the junction's
DC I-V characteristic. Firstly, we unveil how this new hysteresis may be
exploited to access a huge mechanically-induced Shapiro-like voltage plateau,
extending over a current range comparable with the junction's critical current.
We then investigate a sudden mechanically-induced retrapping that occurs at
strong coupling. Our analytical treatment provides a clear explanation for the
effects above and allows us to derive simple relationships between the features
in the DC I-V characteristic and the resonance frequency and quality factor of
the mechanical resonator. We stress that our setup requires only DC current
bias and voltage measurements, allowing the activation and detection of
high-frequency mechanical oscillations in state of the art devices and without
the need of any AC equipment.

Magnetic solitons are promising for applications due to their intrinsic
properties such as small size, topological stability, ultralow power
manipulation and potentially ultrafast operations. To date, research has
focused on the manipulation of skyrmions, domain walls, and vortices by applied
currents. The discovery of new methods to control magnetic parameters, such as
the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) by strain, geometry
design, temperature gradients, and applied voltages promises new avenues for
energetically efficient manipulation of magnetic structures. The latter has
shown significant progress in 2d material-based technology. In this work, we
present a comprehensive study using numerical and analytical methods of the
stability and motion of different magnetic textures under the influence of DMI
gradients. Our results show that under the influence of linear DMI gradients,
N\'eel and Bloch-type skyrmions and radial vortex exhibit motion with finite
skyrmion Hall angle, while the circular vortex undergoes expulsion dynamics.
This work provides a deeper and crucial understanding of the stability and
gradient-driven dynamics of magnetic solitons, and paves the way for the design
of alternative low-power sources of magnetization manipulation in the emerging
field of 2d materials.

<br>
<br>
CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is an emerging layered ferroelectric material with a TC above
room temperature. When synthesized with Cu deficiencies (i.e.,
Cu1-xIn1+x/3P2S6), the material segregates into CIPS and In4/3P2S6 (IPS)
self-assembled heterostructures within the same single crystal. This
segregation results in significant in-plane and out-of-plane strains between
the CIPS and IPS phases as the volume fraction of CIPS (IPS) domains shrink
(grow) with decreasing Cu fraction. Here, we synthesized CIPS with varying
amounts of Cu (x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8 and 1) and measured the
strains between the CIPS and IPS phases through the evolution of the respective
Raman, infrared, and optical reflectance spectra. Density functional theory
calculations revealed vibrational modes unique to the CIPS and IPS phases,
which can be used to distinguish between the two phases through two-dimensional
Raman mapping. A comparison of the composition-dependent frequencies and
intensities of the CIPS and IPS Raman peaks showed interesting trends with
decreasing CIPS phase fraction (i.e., Cu/In ratio). Our data reveal red- and
blue-shifted Raman and infrared peak frequencies that we correlate to lattice
strains arising from the segregation of the material into CIPS and IPS chemical
domains. The strain is highest for a Cu/In ratio of 0.33 (Cu0.4In1.2P2S6),
which we attribute to equal and opposite strains exerted by the CIPS and IPS
phases on each other. In addition, bandgaps extracted from the optical
reflectance spectra revealed a decrease in values, with the lowest value (~ 2.3
eV) for Cu0.4In1.2P2S6.

a solid-vapor growth mechanism. To produce Al2O3-ZnAl2O4-ZnO nanostructure, we
conduct ZnO:C powder heating resulting in ZnO nanowires (NWs) growth on
sapphire substrate and ZnAl2O4 spinel layer at the interface. The nanostructure
was examined with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) method. Focused Ion Beam

<h3>An atomistically informed multiscale approach to the intrusion and  extrusion of water in hydrophobic nanopores</h3>

<br>
<br>
Understanding intrusion and extrusion in nanoporous materials is a
challenging multiscale problem of utmost importance for applications ranging
from energy storage and dissipation to water desalination and hydrophobic
gating in ion channels. Including atomistic details in simulations is required
to predict the overall behavior of such systems, because the statics and
dynamics of these processes depend sensitively on microscopic features of the
pore such as the surface hydrophobicity, geometry, and charge distribution and
on the composition of the liquid. On the other hand, the transitions between
the filled (intruded) and empty (extruded) states are rare events which often
require long simulation times difficult to achieve with standard atomistic
simulations. In this work, we explored the intrusion and extrusion processes by
a multiscale approach in which the atomistic details of the system, extracted
from molecular dynamics simulations, inform a simple Langevin model of water
intrusion/extrusion in the pore. We then used the Langevin simulations to
compute the transition times at different pressures, validating our
coarse-grained model by comparing it with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations. The proposed approach reproduces experimentally relevant features
such as the time and temperature dependence of the intrusion/extrusion cycles,
as well as specific details about the shape of the cycle. This approach also
drastically increases the timescales that can be simulated allowing to reduce
the gap between simulations and experiments and showing promise for more
complex systems.

<h3>Non-collinear Magnetic Atomic Cluster Expansion for Iron</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) provides a formally complete basis for the
local atomic environment. ACE is not limited to representing energies as a
function of atomic positions and chemical species, but can be generalized to
vectorial or tensorial properties and to incorporate further degrees of freedom
(DOF). This is crucial for magnetic materials with potential energy surfaces
that depend on atomic positions and atomic magnetic moments simultaneously. In
this work, we employ the ACE formalism to develop a non-collinear magnetic ACE
parametrization for the prototypical magnetic element Fe. The model is trained
on a broad range of collinear and non-collinear magnetic structures calculated
using spin density functional theory. We demonstrate that the non-collinear
magnetic ACE is able to reproduce not only ground state properties of various
magnetic phases of Fe but also the magnetic and lattice excitations that are
essential for a correct description of the finite temperature behavior and
properties of crystal defects.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the spin Hall effect in a simple tight-binding model
of stacked-kagome Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 with ferromagnetic ordering. We focus
on the two types of the spin Hall current: one flowing in the in-plane
direction with respect to the kagome lattice (in-plane spin Hall current), and
one flowing in the stacking direction (out-of-plane spin Hall current). We show
the spin Hall conductivities for those spin currents drastically change
depending on the direction of the magnetic moment. Especially, the out-of-plane
spin Hall current may induce surface spin accumulation, which are useful for
the perpendicular magnetization switching via spin-orbit torque.

Progress in superconducting device and detector technologies over the past
decade have realized practical applications in quantum computers, detectors for
far-IR telescopes, and optical communications. Superconducting thin film
materials, however, have remained largely unchanged, with aluminum still being
the material of choice for superconducting qubits, and Nb compounds for higher
frequency devices. $\mathrm{MgB}_2$, known for its highest $\mathrm{T}_c$ (39
K) among metallic superconductors, is a viable material for higher frequency
superconducting devices moving towards THz frequencies. However, difficulty in
synthesizing thin films have prevented implementation of $\mathrm{MgB}_2$
devices into the application base of superconducting electronics, despite
promising preliminary results for a number of applications. We have developed
smooth and uniform $\mathrm{MgB}_2$ films on 4-inch Si wafers by depositing
uniform Mg-B co-sputtered film, capping the film in situ to create a closed
environment, followed by an optimized post-annealing step. We further report
mature device fabrication processes and demonstrate test structures to measure
properties of the films. This includes resonators with internal Q factor over
$\mathrm{10}^4$ at 4.5 K and tunable high kinetic inductance (5-50 pH/$\square$
readily achieved in a 40 nm film), opening up the path for development of high
frequency and high temperature $\mathrm{MgB}_2$ microdevices.

<h3>Topological surface states hybridized with bulk states of Bi-doped  PbSb2Te4 revealed in quasiparticle interference</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological surface states of Bi-doped PbSb2Te4 [Pb(Bi0.20Sb0.80)2Te4] are
investigated through analyses of quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns
observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Interpretation of the experimental
QPI patterns in the reciprocal space is achieved by numerical QPI simulations
using two types of surface density of states produced by density functional
theory calculations or a kp surface state model. We found that the Dirac point
(DP) of the surface state appears in the bulk band gap of this material and,
with the energy being away from the DP, the isoenergy contour of the surface
state is substantially deformed or separated into segments due to hybridization
with bulk electronic states. These findings provide a more accurate picture of
topological surface states, especially at energies away from the DP, providing
valuable insight into the electronic properties of topological insulators.

<h3>Dirac half-semimetallicity and antiferromagnetism in graphene  nanoribbon/hexagonal boron nitride heterojunctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Half-metals have been envisioned as active components in spintronic devices
by virtue of their completely spin-polarized electrical currents. Actual
materials hosting half-metallic phases, however, remain scarce. Here, we
predict that recently fabricated heterojunctions of zigzag nanoribbons embedded
in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride are half-semimetallic, featuring
fully spin-polarized Dirac points at the Fermi level. The half-semimetallicity
originates from the transfer of charges from hexagonal boron nitride to the
embedded graphene nanoribbon. These charges give rise to opposite energy shifts
of the states residing at the two edges while preserving their intrinsic
antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. Upon doping, an
antiferromagnetic-to-ferrimagnetic phase transition occurs in these
heterojunctions, with the sign of the excess charge controlling the spatial
localization of the net magnetic moments. Our findings demonstrate that such
heterojunctions realize tunable one-dimensional conducting channels of
spin-polarized Dirac fermions that are seamlessly integrated into a
two-dimensional insulator, thus holding promise for the development of
carbon-based spintronics.

<h3>The Coulomb-Higgs phase transition of three-dimensional lattice  Abelian-Higgs gauge models with noncompact gauge variables and gauge fixing</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the critical behavior of three-dimensional (3D) lattice
Abelian-Higgs (AH) gauge models with noncompact gauge variables and
multicomponent complex scalar fields, along the transition line between the
Coulomb and Higgs phases. Previous works that focused on gauge-invariant
correlations provided evidence that, for a sufficiently large number of scalar
components, these transitions are continuous and associated with the stable
charged fixed point of the renormalization-group flow of the 3D AH field theory
(scalar electrodynamics), in which charged scalar matter is minimally coupled
with an electromagnetic field. Here we extend these studies by considering
gauge-dependent correlations of the gauge and matter fields, in the presence of
two different gauge fixings, the Lorenz and the axial gauge fixing. Our results
for N=25 are definitely consistent with the predictions of the AH field theory
and therefore provide additional evidence for the characterization of the 3D AH
transitions along the Coulomb-Higgs line as charged transitions in the AH
field-theory universality class. Moreover, our results give additional insights
on the role of the gauge fixing at charged transitions. In particular, we show
that scalar correlations are critical only if a hard Lorenz gauge fixing is
imposed.

<br>
<br>
Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) phenomenological approach we analyze
the bending-induced re-distribution of electric polarization and field, elastic
stresses and strains inside ultrathin layers of van der Waals ferrielectrics.
We consider a CuInP2S6 (CIPS) thin layer with fixed edges and suspended central
part, the bending of which is induced by external forces. The unique aspect of
CIPS is the existence of two ferrielectric states, FI1 and FI2, corresponding
to big and small polarization values, which arise due to the specific four-well
potential of the eighth-order LGD functional. When the CIPS layer is flat, the
single-domain FI1 state is stable in the central part of the layer, and the FI2
states are stable near the fixed edges. With an increase of the layer bending
below the critical value, the sizes of the FI2 states near the fixed edges
decreases, and the size of the FI1 region increases. When the bending exceeds
the critical value, the edge FI2 states disappear being substituted by the FI1
state, but they appear abruptly near the inflection regions and expand as the
bending increases. The bending-induced isostructural FI1-FI2 transition is
specific for the bended van der Waals ferrielectrics described by the eighth
(or higher) order LGD functional with consideration of linear and nonlinear
electrostriction couplings. The isostructural transition, which is revealed in
the vicinity of room temperature, can significantly reduce the coercive voltage
of ferroelectric polarization reversal in CIPS nanoflakes, allowing for the
curvature-engineering control of various flexible nanodevices.

Hydrophobic nanoporous materials can be intruded by water only by exerting an
external action, typically increasing pressure. For some materials, water
extrudes when the pressure is lowered again. Controlling intrusion/extrusion
hysteresis is central in a number of technological applications, including
materials for energy applications and for high performance liquid
chromatography, and experimental techniques, as liquid porosimetry, but is
still far from being understood. In this work, we consider water intrusion and
extrusion in common mesoporous materials grafted with hydrophobic chains,
showing that the macroscopic properties of the system are significantly
affected by subnanometric heterogeneities in the grafting. For example,
intrusion and extrusion pressures can vary more than 20 MPa depending on the
chain length and density of the grafting. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations reveal that local changes of radius and contact angle produced by
grafting heterogeneities can pin the interface during intrusion or facilitate
bubble nucleation in extrusion. These unprecedented microscopic insights can
directly impact the design of energy materials and chromatography columns, as
well as the interpretation of porosimetry results.

<br>
<br>
High strength steels are susceptible to H-induced failure, which is typically
caused by the presence of diffusible H in the microstructure. The diffusivity
of H in austenitic steels with fcc crystal structure is slow. The austenitic
steels are hence preferred for applications in the hydrogen-containing
atmospheres. However, the fcc structure of austenitic steels is often
stabilized by the addition of Ni, Mn or N, which are relatively expensive
alloying elements to use. Austenite can kinetically also be stabilized by using
C. Here, we present an approach applied to a commercial cold work tool steel,
where we use C to fully stabilize the fcc phase. This results in a
microstructure consisting of only austenite and an M7C3 carbide. An exposure to
H by cathodic hydrogen charging exhibited no significant influence on the
strength and ductility of the C stabilized austenitic steel. While this
material is only a prototype based on an existing alloy of different purpose,
it shows the potential for low-cost H-resistant steels based on C stabilized
austenite.

theoretical calculations. Lattice strain, crystalline size and dislocation
density have been estimated by Williamson-Hall and modified Williamson-Hall
methods. Thermal variation of resistivity [\r{ho}(T)] and thermopower [S(T)]
have been explained using Mott equation and density of states (DOS)
modification near the Fermi surface due to Co vancancy and embedded phases.

We investigate the formation of paired states of bosons in an optical
lattice, namely, pair superfluid (PSF) and pair supersolid (PSS) in the
presence of pair hopping as well as the next nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction
mimicking long-range forces. Both the zero and finite temperature phase
diagrams are obtained using the cluster mean field theory, which includes the
effect of correlations systematically. We also compute the low-energy
excitations which capture the characteristic features of such paired states and
their transitions. Apart from the gapless sound mode due to the PSF order, a
gapped mode also appears in the PSF phase, similar to the Higgs mode of the
usual atomic superfluid (ASF). The PSF to ASF transition exhibits an intriguing
behavior due to the existence of a `tri-critical' point, where the nature of
transition changes. As a consequence of the continuous PSF-ASF transition, the
gapped mode of both the phases becomes gapless at the critical point. For
sufficiently strong NNN interaction strength, a PSS phase appears with
coexisting pair superfluidity and stripe density order. The softening of the
roton mode as a precursor of density ordering and the appearance of a
low-energy gapped mode serve as robust features related to the formation of the
PSS phase. We also investigate the melting of PSF and PSS phases to normal
fluid at finite temperatures, particularly the melting pathway of PSS which
occurs in atleast two steps due to the coexisting orders. Finally, we discuss
the possibility of emulating such exotic phases in the ongoing cold atom
experiments.

Heat transfer through the interface between a metallic nanoparticle and an
electrolyte solution, has great importance in a number of applications, ranging
from nanoparticle-based cancer treatments to nanofluids and solar energy
conversion devices. However, the impact of surface charge and the dissolved
ions on heat transfer has been scarcely explored so far. In this study, we
compute the interface thermal conductance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic
charged gold nanoparticles immersed in an electrolyte using equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations. Compared with an uncharged nanoparticle, we
report a threefold increase of the Kapitza conductance for a nanoparticle
surface charge +2 e/nm2. This enhancement is shown to be approximately
independent of surface wettability, charge spatial distribution, and salt
concentration. This allows us to express the Kapitza conductance enhancement in
terms of surface charge density on a master curve. Finally, we interpret the
increase of the Kapitza conductance as a combined result of a shift in the
water density distribution toward the charged nanoparticle and an accumulation
of the counter-ions around the nanoparticle surface which increase the
Coulombic interaction between the liquid and the charged nanoparticle.

Kagome materials have emerged as a setting for emergent electronic phenomena
that encompass different aspects of symmetry and topology. It is debated
whether the XV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome family (where X is a rare earth element), a
recently discovered family of bilayer kagome metals, hosts a topologically
non-trivial ground state resulting from the opening of spin-orbit coupling
gaps. These states would carry a finite spin-Berry curvature, and topological
surface states. Here, we investigate the spin and electronic structure of the
XV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome family. We obtain evidence for a finite spin-Berry
curvature contribution at the center of the Brillouin zone, where the nearly
flat band detaches from the dispersing Dirac band because of spin-orbit
coupling. In addition, the spin-Berry curvature is further investigated in the
charge density wave regime of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, and it is found to be robust
against the onset of the temperature-driven ordered phase. Utilizing the
sensitivity of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to the spin and
orbital angular momentum, our work unveils the spin-Berry curvature of
topological kagome metals, and helps to define its spectroscopic fingerprint.

Density functional theory (DFT) is routinely employed in material science and
in quantum chemistry to simulate weakly correlated electronic systems.
Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been adopted to develop promising
functionals for the strongly correlated regime. DFT can be applied to quantum
spin models too, but functionals based on DL have not been developed yet. Here,
we investigate DL-based DFTs for random quantum Ising chains, both with
nearest-neighbor and up to next-nearest neighbor couplings. Our neural
functionals are trained and tested on data produced via the Jordan-Wigner
transformation, exact diagonalization, and tensor-network methods. An
economical gradient-descent optimization is used to find the ground-state
properties of previously unseen Hamiltonian instances. Notably, our non-local
functionals drastically improve upon the common local density approximations,
and they are designed to be scalable, allowing us to simulate chain sizes much
larger than those used for training. The prediction accuracy is analyzed,
paying attention to the spatial correlations of the learned functionals and to
the role of quantum criticality. Our findings indicate a suitable strategy to
extend the reach of other computational methods with a controllable accuracy.

<h3>Half unit cell shift defect induced helical states in Fe-based  chalcogenide superconductors</h3>

Recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy along crystalline domain-walls
associated with a half unit cell shift have revealed sub-gap density of states
that are expected to arise from helical Majorana modes. Such propagating
Majorana modes have been proposed to exist on the surface state of topological
materials similar to FeTe$_{\text{1-x}}$Se$_\text{x}$ (FTS) along line defects
where the superconducting order parameter (OP) is phase shifted by $\pi$. Here
we show that such a $\pi$ shift in theOP across the half unit-cell shift
domain-wall can occur in quite conventional tight-binding models of
superconducting FTS as a result of the $s_{\pm}$ pairing symmetry across
$\Gamma$ and M pockets of FTS. The resultant inter-pocket transmission between
$\Gamma$ and M pockets is found to be typically larger than the intra-pocket
transmissions. We confirm these conclusions with a calculation based on the
Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) formalism which shows that a $\pi$-shift across the
domain-wall is favored for a large range of model parameters for FTS. We
discuss parameter regimes where this mechanism might explain the STS
experiments as well as propose to test this explanation by searching for
evidence of large inter-pocket scattering.

<h3>Clusters of microparticles in distilled water: a kaleidoscope of  versions and paradoxes of nature (Review)</h3>

The presence of microparticles (clusters of micron size) of unknown origin in
the volume of water, including highly purified water (bidistilled, deionized),
has been repeatedly demonstrated by various methods of physical analysis.
Various assumptions have been made about the nature of these microparticles,
but none of them has become generally accepted. The review analyzes the
literature data and the results obtained by the authors using optical and
electron scanning microscopes. The composition and phase state of distilled
water deposits at the bottom of glassware after evaporation of free water are
considered. The structure of the microdispersed phase of distilled water and
the mechanism of phase transitions of its components in the process of natural
evaporation, the end products of which are gel-like water and sodium chloride
crystals, are proposed.

We use a random forest model to predict the critical cooling rate (RC) for
glass formation of various alloys from features of their constituent elements.
The random forest model was trained on a database that integrates multiple
sources of direct and indirect RC data for metallic glasses to expand the
directly measured RC database of less than 100 values to a training set of over
2,000 values. The model error on 5-fold cross validation is 0.66 orders of
magnitude in K/s. The error on leave out one group cross validation on alloy
system groups is 0.59 log units in K/s when the target alloy constituents
appear more than 500 times in training data. Using this model, we make
predictions for the set of compositions with melt-spun glasses in the database,
and for the full set of quaternary alloys that have constituents which appear
more than 500 times in training data. These predictions identify a number of
potential new bulk metallic glass (BMG) systems for future study, but the model
is most useful for identification of alloy systems likely to contain good glass
formers, rather than detailed discovery of bulk glass composition regions
within known glassy systems.

<h3>Thermodynamic cost for precision of general counting observables</h3>

We analytically derive universal bounds that describe the trade-off between
thermodynamic cost and precision in a sequence of events related to some
internal changes of an otherwise hidden physical system. The precision is
quantified by the fluctuations in either the number of events counted over time
or the times between successive events. Our results are valid for the same
broad class of nonequilibrium driven systems considered by the thermodynamic
uncertainty relation, but they extend to both time-symmetric and asymmetric
observables. We show how optimal precision saturating the bounds can be
achieved. For waiting time fluctuations of asymmetric observables, a phase
transition in the optimal configuration arises, where higher precision can be
achieved by combining several signals.
