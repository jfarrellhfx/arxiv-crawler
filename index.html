<h3>Chiral Spin Textures for Next-Generation Memory and Unconventional  Computing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15919" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15919</a>

The realization of chiral spin textures - comprising myriad distinct,
nanoscale arrangements of spins with topological properties - has established
pathways for engineering robust, energy-efficient and scalable elements for
non-volatile nanoelectronics. Particularly, current-induced manipulation of
spin textures in nanowire racetracks and tunnel junction based devices are
actively investigated for applications in memory, logic and unconventional
computing. In this article, we paint a background on the progress of spin
textures, as well as the relevant state-of-the-art techniques used for their
development. In particular, we clarify the competing energy landscape of chiral
spin textures, such as skyrmions and chiral domain walls, to tune their size,
density and zero-field stability. Next, we discuss the spin texture
phenomenology and their response to extrinsic factors arising from geometric
constraints, inter-wire interactions and thermal-electrical effects. Finally,
we reveal promising chiral spintronic memory and neuromorphic devices, and
discuss emerging material and device engineering opportunities.

<h3>Determination of zeta-potential of nanofluids based on electrolyte  solutions from the measurements by the methods of electrical spectroscopy and  laser correlation spectroscopy</h3>

The work discusses the problem of measurement of the zeta-potential for
electrolyte-based suspensions of nanoparticle. A theory is presented for the
effect of the diffuse electric double layer, including the interphase
(stagnant) layer, on the effective conductivity of such suspensions. The theory
is based on the method of compact groups of inhomogeneities applied to a model
system of hard-core-penetrable-shell particles embedded together with the base
liquid in a uniform host of the conductivity. The cores represent the
particles. The shells are electrically inhomogeneous in the radial direction,
their conductivity profile being a continuous function. This model is possible
to analyze rigorously in the static limit. The desired conductivity is found
from the integral relation which allows us to express the electrical
conductivity in the terms of the zeta-potential, thickness of the stagnant
layer, matrix molarity, etc. The theory reveals the existence of different
scenarios of behavior of the conductivity depending on the geometrical and
electrical parameters of the stagnant layer. It is shown that the functional
dependence between the thickness and zeta-potential can be obtained from the
rate of change of the conductivity with concentration for diluted suspensions;
this rate can be measured experimentally. It is pointed out that the
hydrodynamic radius of a nanoparticle can be obtained from the
Smoluchowski-Einstein diffusion coefficient, which can be measured by the
method of laser correlation spectroscopy. In order to find the zeta-potential,
it is necessary to simultaneously do a series of independent measurements: find
the slope of the conductivity and estimate the thickness of the stagnant layer.

<br>
<br>
Density functional theory based study of the pressure dependent physical
properties of binary SnS compound has been carried out. The computed elastic
constants reveal that SnS is mechanically stable and brittle under ambient
conditions. With increasing pressure, the compound becomes ductile. The
Poisson's ratio also indicates brittle-ductile transition with increasing
pressure. The hardness of SnS increases significantly with pressure. The
compound possesses elastic anisotropy. The ground state electronic band
structure is semiconducting with a small band gap which becomes metallic under
pressure. The band becomes more and more dispersive with the increase in
pressure while the electronic correlations decrease as pressure is raised. Both
the Debye temperature and the phonon thermal conductivity of SnS increase
sharply with pressure. The Melting temperature of the compound is low. Mixed
bonding characteristics are found with ionic and covalent contributions. SnS is
a good absorber of ultraviolet light. The reflectivity of the material
increases with the increase in pressure. The reflectivity is nonselective over
a wide spectral range. The low energy refractive index is high. All these
optical characteristics are useful for prospective optoelectronic device
applications. The optical anisotropy is low.

<h3>Jahn-Teller-driven Phase Segregation in Mn$_{x}$Co$_{3-x}$O$_{4}$ Spinel  Thin Films</h3>

Transition metal spinel oxides comprised of Earth-abundant Mn and Co have
long been explored for their use in catalytic reactions and energy storage.
However, understanding of functional properties can be challenging due to
differences in sample preparation and the ultimate structural properties of the
materials. Epitaxial thin film synthesis provides a novel means of producing
precisely-controlled materials to explore the variations reported in the
literature. In this work, Mn$_{x}$Co$_{3-x}$O$_{4}$ samples from x = 0 to x =
1.28 were synthesized through molecular beam epitaxy and characterized to
develop a material properties map as a function of stoichiometry. Films were
characterized via in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
scanning transmission electron microscopy, and polarized K-edge X-ray
absorption spectroscopy. Mn cations within this range were found to be
octahedrally coordinated, in line with an inverse spinel structure. Samples
largely show mixed Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ character with evidence of phase
segregation tendencies with increasing Mn content and increasing Mn$^{3+}$
formal charge. Phase segregation may occur due to structural incompatibility
between cubic and tetragonal crystal structures associated with Mn$^{4+}$ and
Jahn-Teller active Mn$^{3+}$ octahedra, respectively. Our results help to
explain the reported differences across samples in these promising materials
for renewable energy technologies.

<h3>Anisotropic optics and gravitational lensing of tilted Weyl fermions</h3>

We show that tilted Weyl semimetals with a spatially varying tilt of the Weyl
cones provide a platform for studying analogues to problems in anisotropic
optics as well as curved spacetime. Considering particular tilting profiles, we
numerically evaluate the time evolution of electronic wave packets and their
current densities. We demonstrate that electron trajectories in such systems
can be obtained from Fermat's principle in the presence of an inhomogeneous,
anisotropic effective refractive index. On the other hand, we show how the
electrons dynamics reveal gravitational features and use them to simulate
gravitational lensing around a synthetic black hole. These results bridge
optical and gravitational analogies in Weyl semimetals, suggesting novel
pathways for experimental solid-state electron optics.

<h3>Anomalously long lifetimes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids</h3>

A precise characterization of the recently discovered crossover to
hydrodynamic transport in electron liquids, and in particular of a conjectured
exotic tomographic transport regime, requires a full solution of the
Fermi-liquid collision integral at all temperatures beyond state-of-the-art
analytic leading-logarithmic approximations. We develop a general basis
expansion of the linearized collision integral applicable at all temperatures,
and employ this to determine the decay rates of Fermi surface perturbations in
two-dimensional electron liquids. In particular, we provide exhaustive data on
the decay rates for a new tomographic regime, in which parity-even Fermi
surface deformations decay rapidly but odd-parity modes are anomalously
long-lived, and which exists at fairly large temperatures $T \lesssim 0.1 T_F$,
putting this regime within the reach of current experiments.

<h3>The influence of anisotropy on the evolution of interfacial morphologies  in directional solidification: A phase-field study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15673" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15673</a>
<br>
<i>Fengyi Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
By adjusting the interface energy, curvature, and velocity, the anisotropy
plays an important role in the interaction between interfacial processes and
transport processes, determining the solidification structures. In this paper,
through the quantitative phase-field model, the influence of anisotropy on the
evolution of interfacial morphologies in directional solidification is
investigated. To represent different interfacial anisotropies, the
solidification processes with different preferred crystallographic orientations
are performed. Then the effect of anisotropy on morphological evolution is
discussed systematically. At the planar growth stage, the interfacial
anisotropy makes no difference in the transport processes and morphological
evolution. At the onset time of planar instability, the anisotropy determines
the detailed evolution by adjusting the interface stiffness. At the
planar-cellular-transition stage, with the influence of anisotropy, the
interfacial curvature decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}.
Hence, the solute concentration ahead of the interface increases from
{\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}, while the instantaneous velocity of
the interface decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}. At the
quasi-steady-state stage, the anisotropy determines the growth direction and
tip velocity of the primary dendrite, as well as the onset of sidebranches.

<h3>Dynamical phases transitions in periodically driven  Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a systematic study of the dynamical phase diagram of a
periodically driven BCS system as a function of drive strength and frequency.
Three different driving mechanism are considered and compared: oscillating
density of states, oscillating pairing interaction and oscillating external
paring field. We identify the locus in parameter space of parametric resonances
and four dynamical phases: Rabi-Higgs, gapless, synchronized Higgs and
time-crystal. We demonstrate that the main features of the phase diagram are
quite robust to different driving protocols and discuss the order of the
transitions. By mapping the BCS problem to a collection of nonlinear and
interacting classical oscillators, we shed light on the origin of
time-crsytalline phases and parametric resonances appearing for subgap
excitations.

<h3>Fast broadband cluster spin-glass dynamics in  PbFe$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$O$_{3}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15706</a>

<br>
<br>
PbFe$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$O$_{3}$ (PFN) is a relaxor ferroelectric (T$_{c}$
$\sim$ 400 K) consisting of disordered magnetic Fe$^{3+}$ (S=${5\over2}$,
L$\approx$0) ions resulting in a low temperature ``cluster glass" phase (W.
Kleemann $\textit{et al.}$ Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf{105}}$, 257202 (2010)). We
apply neutron scattering to investigate the dynamic magnetism of this phase in
a large single crystal which displays a low temperature spin glass transition
(T$_{g} \sim$ 15 K), but no observable spatially long-range antiferromagnetic
order. The static response in the cluster glass phase (sampled on the timescale
set by our resolution) is found to be characterized by an average magnetic spin
direction that lacks any preferred direction. The dynamics that drive this
phase are defined by a magnetic correlation length that gradually increases
with decreasing temperature. However, below $\sim$ 50 K the spatial
correlations gradually becoming more short range indicative of increasing
disorder on cooling, thereby unravelling magnetism, until the low temperature
glass phase sets in at T$_{g}$ $\sim$ 15 K. Neutron spectroscopy is used to
characterize the spin fluctuations in the cluster glass phase and are found to
be defined by a broadband of frequencies on the scale of $\sim$ THz, termed
here ``fast" fluctuations. The frequency bandwidth driving the magnetic
fluctuations mimics the correlation length and decreases until $\sim$ 50 K, and
then increases again until the glass transition. Through investigating the
low-energy acoustic phonons we find evidence of multiple distinct structural
regions which form the basis of the clusters, generating a significant amount
of local disorder. We suggest that random molecular fields originating from
conflicting interactions between clusters is important for the destruction of
magnetic order and the eventual formation of the cluster glass in PFN.

<h3>Magnetic Solitons due to interfacial chiral interactions</h3>

<br>

We study solitons in a zig-zag lattice of magnetic dipoles. The lattice
comprises two sublattices of parallel chains with magnetic dipoles at their
vertices. Due to orthogonal easy planes of rotation for dipoles belonging to
different sublattices, the total dipolar energy of this system is separable
into a sum of symmetric and chiral long-ranged interactions between the magnets
where the last takes the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling. For a specific
range of values of the offset between sublattices, the dipoles realize an
equilibrium magnetic state in the lattice plane, consisting of one chain
settled in an antiferromagnetic parallel configuration and the other in a
collinear ferromagnetic fashion. If the offset grows beyond this value, the
internal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya field stabilizes two Bloch domain walls at the
edges of the antiferromagnetic chain. The dynamics of these solitons is studied
by deriving the long-wavelength lagrangian density for the easy axis
antiferromagnet. We find that the chiral couplings between sublattices give
rise to an effective magnetic field that stabilizes the solitons in the
antiferromagnet. When the chains displace respect to each other, an emergent
Lorentz force accelerates the domain walls along the lattice.

<h3>Deterministic Localization of Strain-induced Single-photon Emitters in  Multilayer GaSe</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nanoscale strain has emerged as a powerful tool for controlling single-photon
emitters (SPEs) in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)(1,
2). However, quantum emitters in monolayer TMDCs are typically unstable in
ambient conditions. Multilayer two-dimensional (2D) TMDCs could be a solution,
but they suffer from low quantum efficiency, resulting in low brightness of the
SPEs. Here, we report the deterministic spatial localization of strain-induced
single-photon emitters in multilayer GaSe by nanopillar arrays. The
strain-controlled quantum confinement effect introduces well-isolated
sub-bandgap photoluminescence and corresponding suppression of the broad band
edge photoluminescence. Clear photon-antibunching behavior is observed from the
quantum dot-like GaSe sub-bandgap exciton emission at 3.5 Kelvin. The
strain-dependent confinement potential and the brightness are found to be
strongly correlated, suggesting a promising route for tuning and controlling
SPEs. The comprehensive investigations of strain-engineered GaSe SPEs provide a
solid foundation for the development of 2D devices for quantum photonic
technologies.

<h3>Coarsening, condensates and extremes in aggregation-fragmentation models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15742" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15742</a>
<br>
<i>Chandrashekar Iyer, Arghya Das, Mustansir Barma</i>
<br>
<br>
We use extreme value statistics to study the dynamics of coarsening in
aggregation-fragmentation models which form condensates in the steady state.
The dynamics is dominated by the formation of local condensates on a coarsening
length scale which grows in time in both the zero range process and conserved
mass aggregation model. The local condensate mass distribution exhibits
scaling, which implies anomalously large fluctuations, with mean and standard
deviation both proportional to the coarsening length. Remarkably, the state of
the system during coarsening is governed not by the steady state, but rather a
pre-asymptotic state in which the condensate mass fluctuates strongly.

<h3>Current-induced quasiparticle magnetic multipole moments</h3>

Magnetic ordering beyond the standard dipolar order has attracted significant
attention in recent years, but it remains an open question how to effectively
manipulate such nontrivial order parameters using external perturbations. In
this context, we present a theory for Cartesian magnetic multipole moments and
their currents created by electric currents based on a general gauge-invariant
formula for arbitrary-order spin magnetic multipole moments of Bloch wave
packets. As a concrete example, we point out that the low-energy quasiparticles
in phosphorene subject to a perpendicular electric field have a valley
structure that hosts magnetic octupole moments. The quasiparticle magnetic
octupole moments can be exhibited by an in-plane electric current and lead to
accumulation of staggered spin densities at the corners of a rectangular-shaped
sample. A current carrying the octupole moments can further be induced through
nonlinear response. Our work paves the way to systematically searching for and
utilizing quasiparticles with higher-order magnetic multipole moments in
crystal materials.

<h3>A general method for multiresolutional analysis of mesoscale features in  dark-field x-ray microscopy images</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dark-field x-ray microscopy utilizes Bragg diffraction to collect full-field
x-ray images of "mesoscale" structure of ordered materials. Information
regarding the structural heterogeneities and their physical implications is
gleaned through the quantitative analyses of these images. Namely, one must be
able to extract diffraction features that arise from lattice modulations or
inhomogeneities, quantify said features, and identify and track patterns in the
relevant quantitative properties in subsequent images. Due to the necessity to
track features with a wide array of shapes and length scales while maintaining
spatial resolution, wavelet transforms were chosen as a potent signal analysis
tool. In addition to addressing multiple length scales, this method can be used
in conjunction with other signal processing methods such as image binarization
for increased functionality. In this article, we demonstrate three effective
use of wavelet analyses pertaining to DFXM. We show how to extract and track
smooth linear features-which are diffraction manifestations of twin
boundaries-as the sample orientation changes as it is rotated about momentum
transfer. Secondly, we show that even the simplest wavelet transform, the Haar
transform, can be used to capture the primary features in DFXM images, over a
range of length scales in different regions of interest within a single image
enabling localized reconstruction. As a final application, we extend these
techniques to determine when a DFXM image is in focus.

<h3>Second to first order phase transition; coevolutionary versus structural  balance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15771" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15771</a>
<br>
<i>M. Ghanbarzadeh Noudehi, A. Kargaran, N. Azimi-Tafreshi, G. R. Jafari</i>
<br>
<br>
In social networks, the balance theory has been studied by considering either
the triple interactions between the links (structural balance) or the triple
interaction of nodes and links (coevolutionary balance). In the structural
balance theory, the links are not independent from each other, implying a
global effect of this term and it leads to a discontinuous phase transition in
the system's balanced states as a function of temperature. However, in the
coevolutionary balance the links only connect two local nodes and a continuous
phase transition emerges. In this paper, we consider a combination of both in
order to understand which of these types of interactions will identify the
stability of the network. We are interested to see how adjusting the robustness
of each term versus the other might affect the system to reach a balanced
state. We use statistical mechanics methods and the mean field theory and also
the Monte-Carlo numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of the order
parameters and the total energy of the system. We find the phase diagram of the
system which demonstrates the competition of these two terms at different
ratios against each other and different temperatures. The system shows a
tricritical point above which the phase transition switches from continuous to
discrete. Also the superiority of the local perspective is observed at low
temperatures and the global view will be the dominant term in determining the
stability of the system at higher temperatures.

<h3>The adiabatic sweep theorem for three-dimensional dipolar Bose gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15772</a>

The variational theorem for the scattering length in the presence of the
dipole-dipole interaction is developed. The theorem is applied to the spinless
dipolar Bose gas in three dimensions. We calculated analytically the long-range
tails of the single-particle momentum distribution and static structure factor,
and the pair distribution function at short distances. The momentum
distribution is inversely proportional to $q^4$ with the anisotropic prefactor.
In the absence of the dipole-dipole interaction, Tan's adiabatic sweep theorem
is reproduced as a particular case. For the homogeneous dilute Bose gas, all
the relations are calculated analytically.

<h3>Effect of Electromigration on Onset of Morphological Instability of a  Nanowire</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15797" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15797</a>

<i>Mikhail Khenner</i>
<br>
<br>
Morphological stability of a cylindrical nanowire on a substrate in the
applied electric field directed along a nanowire axis is studied for arbitrary
contact angles. Exact analytical solution is obtained for 90 degrees contact
angle and, assuming axisymmetric perturbations, for a free-standing wire. The
latter solution extends the 1965 result by Nichols and Mullins without
electromigration effect (F.A. Nichols and W.W. Mullins, ``Surface-(Interface-)
and volume-diffusion contributions to morphological changes driven by
capillarity", Trans. Metall. Soc. AIME 233, 1840-1848 (1965)). For general
contact angles the neutral stability is determined numerically. It is shown
that stronger applied electric field results in larger regions of instability
in the parameter space and in decrease of the most dangerous instability
wavelength; in a third-party experiments, it was demonstrated that the latter
gives rise to more dense arrays of nanonaprticles that emerge upon a wire
breakup.

<h3>Hidden Topological Transitions in Emergent Magnetic Monopole Lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15816" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15816</a>

<br>
<br>
Topological defects, called magnetic hedgehogs, realize emergent magnetic
monopoles, which are not allowed in the ordinary electromagnetism described by
Maxwell's equations. Such monopoles were experimentally discovered in magnets
in two different forms: tetrahedral $4Q$ and cubic $3Q$ hedgehog lattices. The
spin textures are modulated by the chemical composition, an applied magnetic
field, and temperature, leading to quantum transport and optical phenomena
through movement and pair annihilation of magnetic monopoles, but the
theoretical understanding remains elusive, especially in the regions where
different types of hedgehog lattices are competing. Here we propose a
theoretical model that can stabilize both tetrahedral and cubic hedgehog
lattices, and perform a thorough investigation of the phase diagram while
changing the interaction parameters, magnetic field, and temperature, by using
a recently developed method that delivers exact solutions in the thermodynamic
limit. We find that the model exhibits various types of topological transitions
with changes of the density of monopoles and antimonopoles, some of which are
accompanied by anomalies in the thermodynamic quantities, while the others are
hidden with less or no anomaly. We also find another hidden topological
transition with pair annihilation of two-dimensional vortices in the
three-dimensional system. These results not only provide useful information for
understanding the existing experimental data, but also challenge the
identification of hidden topological transitions and the exploration of
emergent electromagnetism in magnetic monopole lattices.

<h3>Explicit Demonstration of Geometric Frustration in Chiral Liquid  Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15832</a>
<br>
<i>Cheng Long, Jonathan V. Selinger</i>
<br>
<br>
Many solid materials and liquid crystals exhibit geometric frustration,
meaning that they have an ideal local structure that cannot fill up space. For
that reason, the global phase must be a compromise between the ideal local
structure and geometric constraints. As an explicit example of geometric
frustration, we consider a chiral liquid crystal confined in a long cylinder
with free boundaries. When the radius of the tube is sufficiently small, the
director field forms a double-twist configuration, which is the ideal local
structure. However, when the radius becomes larger (compared with the natural
twist of the liquid crystal), the double-twist structure cannot fill space, and
hence the director field must transform into some other chiral structure that
can fill space. This space-filling structure may be either (1) a cholesteric
phase with single twist, or (2) a set of double-twist regions separated by a
disclination, which can be regarded as the beginning of a blue phase. We
investigate these structures using theory and simulations, and show how the
relative free energies depend on the system size, the natural twist, and the
disclination energy. As another example, we also study a cholesteric liquid
crystal confined between two infinite parallel plates with free boundaries.

<h3>Sliding nanomechanical resonators</h3>

The motion of a vibrating object is determined by the way it is held. This
simple observation has long inspired string instrument makers to create new
sounds by devising elegant string clamping mechanisms, whereby the distance
between the clamping points is modulated as the string vibrates. At the
nanoscale, the simplest way to emulate this principle would be to controllably
make nanoresonators slide across their clamping points, which would effectively
modulate their vibrating length. Here, we report measurements of flexural
vibrations in nanomechanical resonators that reveal such a sliding motion.
Surprisingly, the resonant frequency of vibrations draws a loop as a tuning
gate voltage is cycled. This behavior indicates that sliding is accompanied by
a delayed frequency response of the resonators, making their dynamics richer

We study the properties of the upper critical field of superconductivity in
nodal-line semimetals in a continuous model, which has a nodal-line on the
$k_{z} = 0$ plane. Using the semiclassical Green's function method, we
calculate the upper critical field for the two limiting cases: the dirty limit
with many impurities and the clean limit with few impurities. The results show
the large anisotropy of the magnitude of the upper critical field and the
unusual temperature dependence. The obtained results are compared with recent
experimental data of PbTaSe$_{2}$.

The rare-earth triangular-lattice chalcogenide is a great platform for
exploring both spin liquids and novel magnetic orders with anisotropic spin
interactions and magnetic frustrations. Here, we report the thermodynamic and
neutron scattering measurements of rare-earth triangular-lattice chalcogenide
KErSe$_{2}$, using single-crystal samples. Our experiments revealed a
long-range stripe order below 0.2 K. Although the magnetic order was
three-dimensional, magnetic excitations exhibited negligible modulation along
the z direction, indicating very weak interlayer coupling. Furthermore,
magnetic excitation developed a well-defined spin-wave dispersion with a gap of
$\sim$0.03 meV at M points. Both the stripe order and spin-wave excitations
could be quantitatively understood from the anisotropic spin interactions of
the Er$^{3+}$ Kramers doublets.

<h3>Lattice dielectric properties of rutile $\mathrm{TiO}_2$:  First-principles anharmonic self-consistent phonon study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15873</a>
<br>
<i>Tomohito Amano, Tamio Yamazaki, Ryosuke Akashi, Terumasa Tadano, Shinji Tsuneyuki</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the lattice dielectric function of strongly anharmonic rutile
$\mathrm{TiO}_2$ from ab initio anharmonic lattice dynamics methods. Since an
accurate calculation of the $\Gamma$ point phonons is essential for determining
optical properties, we employ the modified self-consistent approach, including
third-order anharmonicity as well as fourth-order anharmonicity. The resulting
optical phonon frequencies and linewidths at the $\Gamma$ point much better
agree with experimental measurements than those from a perturbative approach.
We show that the four-phonon scattering process contributes as much as the
third-order anharmonic term to phonon linewidths. Furthermore, incorporating
the frequency dependence of phonon linewidth reveals that experimentally known
but unidentified peaks of the dielectric function are due to two-phonon
process. This work emphasizes the importance of a self-consistent approach in
predicting the optical properties of highly anharmonic materials.

The Hall scattering factor of Sc2CF2, Sc2CO2 and Sc2C(OH)2 is calculated
using Rode's iterative approach by solving the Boltzmann transport equation.
This is carried out in conjunction with calculations based on density
functional theory. The electrical transport in Sc2CF2, Sc2CO2, and Sc2C(OH)2 is
modelled by accounting for both elastic (acoustic and piezoelectric) and
inelastic (polar optical phonon) scattering. Polar optical phonon (POP)
scattering is the most significant mechanism in these MXenes. We observe that
there is a window of carrier concentration where Hall factor acts dramatically;
Sc2CF2 obtains an incredible high value of 2.49 while Sc2CO2 achieves a very
small value of approximately 0.5, and Sc2C(OH)2 achieves the so called ideal
value of 1. We propose in this paper that such Hall factor behaviour has
significant promise in the field of surface group identification in MXenes, an
issue that has long baffled researchers.

<h3>Numerical simulations of confined Brownian motion</h3>

Brownian motion is a central scientific paradigm. Recently, due to increasing
efforts and interests towards miniaturization and small-scale physics or
biology, the effects of confinement on such a motion have become a key topic of
investigation. Essentially,when confined near a wall, a particle moves much
slower than in the bulk due to friction at the boundaries. The mobility is
therefore locally hindered and space-dependent, which in turn leads to the
apparition of so-called multiplicative noises. Here, we present efficient,
broadrange and quantitative numerical simulations of a such a problem.
Specifically, we integrate the overdamped Langevin equation governing the
thermal dynamics of a negatively-buoyant spherical colloid within a viscous
fluid confined by rigid walls, including surface charges. From the produced
large set of long random trajectories, we perform a complete statistical
analysis and extract all the key quantities, such as the probability
distributions in displacements and their first moments. In particular, we
propose a convenient method to compute high-order cumulants by reducing
convergence problems, and employ it to characterize the inherent
non-Gaussianity of the process.

Clathrate hydrate is a naturally occurring ice-like solid which forms in
water phase under suitable temperature and pressure conditions, in the presence
of one or more hydrophobic molecules. It also forms inside the oil and gas
pipes leading to higher pumping cost, flow blockage and even catastrophic
accidents. Engineered surfaces with low hydrate adhesion can provide an
effective solution to this problem. Liquid impregnated surfaces is one such
example of engineered surfaces which has already shown tremendous potential in
reducing the nucleation and adhesion of solids. Here we report the design and
synthesis of liquid impregnated surfaces with extremely low hydrate adhesion
under the mixed environment of oil and water. The most challenging aspect of
designing these surfaces was to stabilize a lubricant layer simultaneously
under the water and oil. A detailed methodology to make such lubricant stable
surfaces from theoretical perspective was described and experimentally
validated for lubricant stability. Experimental measurements on such surfaces
showed extremely low hydrate accumulation and one order of magnitude or more
reduction in hydrate adhesion force.

<br>
<br>
To realize high-temperature operation of Si qubits, deep impurity levels with
large confinement energy, which are hardly thermally excited, have been
introduced into Si wafers. Group II-VI impurities S, Zn, and Se, which are
known to form deep levels, were introduced into the Si substrates by ion
implantation. These samples were analyzed for concentration-depth profiles,
energy level depths, and absence of defects. To introduce deep impurities into
the channel of Si transistors, the conditions to introduce the impurities were
found so that the concentration-depth profiles have maximum values at less than
50 nm from the Si surface. Then, the formation of the deep levels and absence
of defects were experimentally examined. By using the conditions to introduce
deep impurities into Si wafer obtained from the experiments, single-electron
transport at room temperature, high-temperature operation of qubit, and
room-temperature quantum magnetic sensors are promising.

<h3>Systematic study for two-dimensional $Z_2$ topological phase transitions  at high-symmetry points in all layer groups</h3>

<i>Ren Sasaki, Yutaro Tanaka, Shuichi Murakami</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct a general theory of $Z_2$ topological phase transitions in
two-dimensional systems with time-reversal symmetry. We investigate
possibilities of $Z_2$ topological phase transitions at band inversions at all
high-symmetry points in $k$-space in all the 80 layer groups. We exclude the
layer groups with inversion symmetry, because the $Z_2$ topological phase
transition is known to be associated with band inversions with exchange of
parities. Among the other layer groups we find 21 layer groups which can have
insulator-to-insulator transitions with band inversion, and this problem is
finally reduced to five point groups $C_3, C_4, C_6, S_4$, and $C_{3h}$. We
show how the change of the $Z_2$ topological invariant at a band inversion is
completely determined by the irreps of occupied and unoccupied bands at the
high-symmetry point. For example, in the case of $C_3$, we showed that the
$Z_2$ topological invariants change whenever the band inversion occurs between
two Kramers pairs whose $C_3$ eigenvalues are $\{e^{\pi i / 3}, e^{-\pi i /
3}\}$ and $\{-1, -1\}$. These results are not included in the theory of
symmetry-based indicators or topological quantum chemistry.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate three-body losses in a single-component Fermi
gas near a $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in the interacting, non-unitary regime.
We extend the cascade model introduced by Waseem et al. [Phys. Rev. A 99 052704
(2019)] to describe the elastic and inelastic collision processes. We find that
the loss behavior exhibits a $n^3$ and an anomalous $n^2$ dependence for a
ratio of elastic to inelastic collision rate larger and smaller than one,
respectively. The corresponding evolutions of the energy distribution show
collisional cooling or evolution toward low-energetic non-thermalized steady
states, respectively. These findings are in particular relevant for
understanding atom loss and energetic evolution of ultracold gases of fermionic
lithium atoms in their ground state.

We have performed Compton scattering measurements on as-grown and reduced
single crystals of the electron-doped T'-cuprate Pr1.3-xLa0.7CexCuO4 (x = 0.10)
to investigate the effect of reduction annealing on the electronic state. The
obtained results have revealed that the numbers of electrons in the O2p orbital
in the Zhang-Rice singlet band, the Cu3dx2-y2 orbital, and the Cu3d3z2-r2
orbital are increased by reduction annealing. The increase in the number of
Cu3d3z2-r2 electrons suggests the existence of Cu3d3z2-r2 holes in the as-grown
single crystal. This is spectroscopic evidence of local hole doping into the
Cu3d3z2-r2 orbital around the excess oxygen, as suggested by transport
measurements [T. Adachi et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 82, 063713 (2013)].

<h3>Charge fluctuation and charge-resolved entanglement in monitored quantum  circuit with U(1) symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>Hisanori Oshima, Yohei Fuji</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit consisting of Haar-random
unitary gates and projective measurements that conserve a total $U(1)$ charge
and thus have $U(1)$ symmetry. In addition to a measurement-induced
entanglement transition between a volume-law and an area-law entangled phase,
we find a phase transition between two phases characterized by bipartite charge
fluctuation growing with the subsystem size or staying constant. At this
charge-fluctuation transition, steady-state quantities obtained by evolving an
initial state with a definitive total charge exhibit critical scaling behaviors
akin to Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid theory for equilibrium critical quantum
systems with $U(1)$ symmetry, such as logarithmic scaling of bipartite charge
fluctuation, power-law decay of charge correlation functions, and logarithmic
scaling of charge-resolved entanglement whose coefficient becomes a universal
quadratic function in a flux parameter. These critical features, however, do
not persist below the transition in contrast to a recent prediction based on
replica field theory and mapping to a classical statistical mechanical model.

We investigate the unusual phase transitions in SrRuO$_{3}$ and
Sr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$Ru$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$O$_{3}$ (x=0,0.05 and 0.1) employing
x-ray diffraction, resistivity, magnetic studies and x-ray photoemission
spectroscopy. Our results show the compounds undergo crossover from $itinerant$
ferromagnetism to $localised$ ferromagnetism. The combined studies suggests Ru
and Cr to be in 4+ valence state. A Griffith phase and an enhancement in Curie
temperature (Tc) from 38 K to 107 K is observed with Cr doping. A shift in the
chemical potential towards the valence band is observed with Cr doping. In the
metallic samples, interestingly, a direct link between the resistivity and
orthorhombic strain is observed. Detailed studies in this direction will be
helpful to understand the nature of interactions and hence manoeuvre its
properties. In the non metallic samples, the resistivity is mainly governed by
disorder and electron-electron correlation effects. The value of the
resistivity for the 5% Cr doped sample suggests semi metallic behaviour.
Understanding its nature in detail using electron spectroscopic techniques
could unravel the possibility of its utility in high mobility transistors at
room temperature and its combined property with ferromagnetism will be helpful
in making spintronic devices.

<h3>Dynamically generated quadrupole polarization using Floquet adiabatic  evolution</h3>

<br>
<i>Gonzalo Camacho, Christoph Karrasch, Roman Rausch</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the $S=1$ quantum spin chain
subjected to a time-dependent external drive, where the driving frequency is
adiabatically decreased as a function of time (``Floquet adiabatic
evolution''). We show that when driving the rhombic anisotropy term (known as
the ``two-axis countertwisting'' in the context of squeezed spin states) of a
N\'eel antiferromagnet, we are able to induce an overall enhancement in the
quadrupole polarization, while at the same time suppressing the staggered
magnetization order. The system evolves into a new state with a net quadrupole
moment and antiferroquadrupolar correlations. This state remains stable at long
times once the driving frequency is kept constant. On the other hand, we find
that we cannot achieve a quadrupole polarization for the symmetry-protected
Haldane phase, which remains robust against such driving.

<h3>Spin and charge modulations of a half-filled extended Hubbard model</h3>

<br>
<i>LoÃ¯c Philoxene, Vu Hung Dao, Raymond FrÃ©sard</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce and analyze an extended Hubbard model, in which intersite
Coulomb interaction as well as a staggered local potential (SLP) are
considered, on the square lattice at half band filling, in the thermodynamic
limit. Using both Hartree-Fock approximation and Kotliar and Ruckenstein slave
boson formalism, we show that the model harbors charge order (CO) as well as
joint spin and charge modulations (SCO) at finite values of the SLP, while the
spin density wave (SDW) is stabilized for vanishing SLP, only. We determine
their phase boundaries and the variations of the order parameters in dependence
on the SLP, as well as on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions.
Domains of coexistence of CO and SCO phases, suitable for resistive switching
experiments, are unraveled. We show that the novel SCO systematically turns
into the more conventional SDW phase when the zero-SLP limit is taken. We also
discuss the nature of the different phase transitions, both at zero and finite
temperature. In the former case, no continuous CO to SDW (or SCO) phase
transition occurs. In contrast, a paramagnetic phase (PM), which is accompanied
with continuous phase transitions towards both spin or charge ordered phases,
sets in at finite temperature. A good quantitative agreement with numerical
simulations is demonstrated, and a comparison between the two used approaches
is performed.

<i>Maciej Fidrysiak</i>
<br>
<br>
We carry out a systematic study of collective spin- and charge excitations
for the canonical single-band Hubbard, $t$-$J$-$U$, and $t$-$J$ models of
high-temperature copper-oxide superconductors, both on electron- and hole-doped
side of the phase diagram. Recently developed variational wave function
approach, combined with the expansion in inverse number of fermionic flavors,
is employed. All three models exhibit a substantial electron-hole asymmetry of
magnetic excitations, with a robust paramagnon emerging for hole-doping, in
agreement with available resonant inelastic $x$-ray scattering data for the
cuprates. The $t$-$J$ model yields additional high-energy peak in the magnetic
spectrum that is not unambiguously identified in spectroscopy. For all
considered Hamiltonians, the dynamical charge susceptibility contains a
coherent mode for both hole- and electron doping, with overall bandwidth
renormalization controlled by the on-site Coulomb repulsion. Away from the
strong-coupling limit, the antiferromagnetic ordering tendency is more
pronounced on electron-doped side of the phase diagram.

One of the main features regarding thermally isolated systems is their
incapacity to relax, in general. We propose here an approach in linear response
theory where this aspect is avoided: by looking to a quite reasonable quantity
of interest, the time-averaged excess work, we show that the system recovers an
intrinsic relaxation time. The adiabatic process by which the system passes
through presents then the same mathematical properties of isothermal processes,
such as a natural extension to the slowly-varying regime and the same mechanism
of producing negative entropy production rate for rapid and weak processes. We
illustrate the result with the Landau-Zener model.

<h3>Local Dirac Synchronization on Networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Lucille Calmon, Ginestra Bianconi</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose Local Dirac Synchronization which uses the Dirac operator to
capture the dynamics of coupled nodes and links signals on an arbitrary
network. In Local Dirac Synchronization, the harmonic modes of the dynamics
oscillate freely while the other modes are interacting non-linearly, leading to
a collectively synchronized state when the coupling constant of the model is
increased. Here we discuss the motivation of the model and the resulting
collective behavior on uncorrelated random networks and fully connected
networks. Local Dirac Synchronization on these networks is characterized by
discontinuous transitions and the emergence of a rhythmic coherent phase. In
this rhythmic phase, one of the two complex order parameters oscillates in the
complex plane at a slow frequency (called emergent frequency) in the frame in
which the intrinsic frequencies have zero average. Extensive numerical results
on fully connected networks and sparse Poisson and scale-free networks are well
captured by our theoretical predictions, where for sparse uncorrelated networks
these predictions are obtained within the annealed approximation. These results
reveal the interplay between topology (Betti numbers and harmonic modes) and
non-linear dynamics and unveil how topology might play a role in the onset of
brain rhythms.

<br>
<br>
In this work we discuss particular effects that take place in systems of
quantum emitters coupled to two-dimensional bosonic topological insulators. For
a single emitter coupled to the Haldane model, we find a "fragile" quasibound
state that makes the emitter dynamics very sensitive to the model's parameters,
and gives rise to effective long-range interactions that break time-reversal
symmetry. We then discuss one-dimensional arrangements of emitters, emitter
line defects, and how the topology of the bath affects the effective polariton
models that appear in the weak-coupling regime when the emitters are spectrally
tuned to a bandgap. In the Harper-Hofstadter model we link the non-monotonic
character of the effective interactions to the Chern numbers of the surrounding
energy bands, while in the Haldane model we show that the effective models are
either gapless or not depending on the topology of the bath. Last, we discuss
how the presence of emitters forming an ordered array, an emitter superlattice,
can produce polariton models with non-trivial Chern numbers, and also modify
the topology of the photonic states in the bath.

Antiferromagnets have recently been propelled to the forefront of spintronics
by their high potential for revolutionizing memory technologies. For this,
understanding the formation and driving mechanisms of the domain structure is
paramount. In this work, we investigate the domain structure in a thin-film
canted antiferromagnet $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. We find that the internal
destressing fields driving the formation of domains do not follow the crystal
symmetry of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, but fluctuate due to substrate clamping. This
leads to an overall isotropic distribution of the N\'eel order with locally
varying effective anisotropy in antiferromagnetic thin films. Furthermore, we
show that the weak ferromagnetic nature of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ leads to a
qualitatively different dependence on magnetic field compared to collinear
antiferromagnets such as NiO. The insights gained from our work serve as a
foundation for further studies of electrical and optical manipulation of the
domain structure of antiferromagnetic thin films.

<h3>Evaporation of water and urea solution in a magnetic field; the role of  nuclear isomers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hypothesis. Ortho and para water are the two nuclear isomers where the
hydrogen protons align to give a total nuclear spin of 0 or 1.The equilibrium
ratio of 3:1 is established slowly in freshly evaporated water vapour and the
isomers then behave distinct gasses, with their own partial pressures.
Magnetic-field-induced ortho to para transformations are expected to alter the
evaporation rate.
Experiment. Evaporation from beakers of deionized water and a 6 M solution of
urea is monitored simultaneously for periods from 1 to 60 hours with and
without a 500 mT magnetic field, while logging the ambient temperature and
humidity. The balances with the two beakers are shielded in the same Perspex
container. Many runs have been conducted over a two-year period.
Findings. The evaporation rate of water is found to increase by 12 % of in
the field but that of water in urea solution decreases by 28 6 %. Two effects
are at play. One is dephasing of the Larmor precession of adjacent protons on a
water molecule in a field gradient, which tends to equalize the isomer
populations. The other is Lorentz stress on the moving charge dipole, which can
increase the proportion of the ortho isomer. From analysis of the time and
field dependence of the evaporation, we infer an ortho fraction of 39 % in
fresh vapour from water and 60 % in fresh vapour from urea.

We report gate-induced enhancement of intrinsic charge rectification without
p-n junctions in chiral semiconductor Te under magnetic field B. As gating
shifts the chemical potential to the valence band maximum of Te, the charge
rectification efficiency is enhanced hundredfold. By integrating model
calculations, we attribute the charge rectification to the B-induced asymmetry
of the chiral band structure. We also show that the carrier density subject to
this asymmetry is augmented by a saddle-point structure near the valence band
maximum, which further enhances the gate-tunable charge rectification together
with its improved switchability and thermal robustness.

<br>
<br>
Previous investigations of 4$H_b$-TaS$_{2-2x}$Se$_{2x}$ mainly focused on the
direct competition between superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW).
However, the superconductivity itself, although has been prominently enhanced
by isovalent Se substitution, has not been adequately investigated. Here, we
performed a detailed electrical transport measurement down to 0.1 K on a series
of 4$H_b$-TaS$_{2-2x}$Se$_{2x}$ single crystals. A systematic fitting of the
temperature-dependent resistance demonstrates that the decreased Debye
temperatures ($\Theta_{D}$) and higher electron-phonon coupling constants
($\lambda_{e-p}$) at the optimal Se doping content raise the superconducting
transition temperature ($T_c$). Additionally, we discovered that the
incorporation of Se diminishes the degree of anisotropy of the
superconductivity in the highly layered structure. More prominently, a
comprehensive analysis of the vortex liquid phase region reveals that the
optimally doped sample deviates from the canonical 2D Tinkham prediction but
favors a linear trend with the variation of the external magnetic field. These
findings emphasize the importance of interlayer interaction in this segregated
superconducting-Mott-insulating system.

We investigate the spatial correlations of microscopic stresses in soft
particulate gels, using 2D and 3D numerical simulations. We use a recently
developed theoretical framework predicting the analytical form of stress-stress
correlations in amorphous assemblies of athermal grains that acquire rigidity
under an external load. These correlations exhibit a pinch-point singularity in
Fourier space leading to long-range correlations and strong anisotropy in real
space, which are at the origin of force-chains in granular solids. Our analysis
for the model particulate gels at low particle volume fractions demonstrates
that stress-stress correlations in these soft materials have characteristics
very similar to those in granular solids and can be used to identify force
chains. We show that the stress-stress correlations can distinguish floppy from
rigid gel networks and the intensity patterns reflect changes in shear moduli
and network topology, due to the emergence of rigid structures during
solidification.

Visualizing atomic-orbital degrees of freedom is a frontier challenge in
scanned microscopy. Some types of orbital order are virtually imperceptible for
normal scattering technique because they do not reduce the overall crystal
lattice symmetry. A good example is dxz/dyz ({\pi},{\pi}) orbital order in
tetragonal lattices. For enhanced detectability, here we consider the
quasiparticle scattering interference (QPI) signature of such ({\pi},{\pi})
orbital order in both normal and superconducting phases. The theory reveals
that sublattice-specific QPI signatures generated by the orbital order should
emerge strongly in the superconducting phase. Sublattice-resolved QPI
visualization in superconducting CeCoIn5 then reveals two orthogonal QPI
patterns at lattice-substitutional impurity atoms. We analyze the energy
dependence of these two orthogonal QPI patterns and find the intensity peaked
near E=0, as predicted when such ({\pi}) orbital order is inte,{\pi}rtwined
with d-wave superconductivity. Sublattice-resolved superconductive QPI
techniques thus represent a new approach for study of hidden orbital order.

We show that the presence of anyons in the excitation spectrum of a
two-dimensional system can be inferred from nonlinear spectroscopic quantities.
In particular, we consider pump-probe spectroscopy, where a sample is
irradiated by two light pulses with an adjustable time delay between them. The
relevant response coefficient exhibits a universal form that originates from
the statistical phase acquired when anyons created by the first pulse braid
around those created by the second. This behaviour is shown to be qualitatively
unchanged by non-universal physics including non-statistical interactions and
small finite temperatures. In magnetic systems, the signal of interest can be
measured using currently available terahertz-domain probes, highlighting the
potential usefulness of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques in the search for
quantum spin liquids.

<h3>Black hole mirages: electron lensing and Berry curvature effects in  inhomogeneously tilted Weyl semimetals</h3>

We study electronic transport in Weyl semimetals with spatially varying nodal
tilt profiles. We find that the flow of electrons can be guided precisely by
judiciously chosen tilt profiles. In a wide regime of parameters, we show that
electron flow is described well by semiclassical equations of motion similar to
the ones governing gravitational attraction. This analogy provides a physically
transparent tool for designing tilt-tronic devices, such as electronic lenses.
The analogy to gravity circumvents the notoriously difficult full-fledged
description of inhomogeneous solids, but a comparison to microscopic lattice
simulations shows that it is only valid for trajectories sufficiently far from
analogue black holes. We finally comment on the Berry curvature-driven
transverse motion and relate the latter to spin precession physics.

<h3>Elastic traits of the extensible discrete worm-like chain model</h3>

Polymer models play the special role of elucidating the elementary features
describing the physics of long molecules and become essential to interpret the
measurements of their magnitudes. In this work the end-to-end distance of an
extensible discrete worm-like chain polymer as a function of the applied force
has been calculated both numerically and analytically, the latter as an
effective approximation. The numerical evaluation uses the Transfer Matrix
formalism to obtain an exact calculation of the partition function, while the
analytic derivations generalize the simple phenomenological formulas largely
used up to now. The obtained formulas are simple enough to be implemented in
the fit analysis of experimental data of semi-flexible extensible polymers,
with the result that the elastic parameters obtained are compatible with
previous measurements, and more, their accuracy strongly improves in a large
range of chain extensibility.

<h3>Thermal vestiges of avalanches in the driven random field Ising model</h3>

We investigate the non-equilibrium behavior of the $3d$ random field Ising
model at finite temperature, as an external field is increased through its
coercive field. We show by numerical simulations that the phenomenology of
avalanches -- which are sharply defined only at zero temperature -- also
persists over a significant range of finite temperatures. We analyse the main
differences between the thermal and zero-temperature systems, including an
excess of small avalanches in the thermal case, whose behaviour is consistent
with activated dynamical scaling. We also investigate the extent to which
individual avalanches at finite temperature can be traced back to parent
avalanches in the athermal system.

<h3>Pair-Kondo effect: a mechanism for time-reversal broken  superconductivity and finite-momentum pairing in UTe$_2$</h3>

<br>

An important open puzzle in the superconductivity of UTe$_2$ is the emergence
of time-reversal broken superconductivity from a non-magnetic normal state.
Breaking time-reversal symmetry in a single second-order superconducting
transition requires the existence of two degenerate superconducting order
parameters, which is not natural for orthorhombic UTe$_2$. Moreover,
experiments under pressure suggest that this superconductivity sets in at a
single transition temperature in a finite parameter window, in contrast to
splitting between the symmetry breaking temperatures expected for accidental
degenerate orders. Here we demonstrate that the thermodynamic phase diagram of
a triplet superconductor near a magnetic quantum phase transition can contain
an extended region, where time-reversal breaking superconductivity onsets in a
single, weakly first order transition. It arises due to coupling between
incipient magnetic order and magnetic moments of triplet pairs, which favors a
time-reversal broken superconducting state. A microscopic origin of this
coupling is identified as screening of magnetic moments by chiral Cooper pairs,
built out of two non-degenerate pairs - an extension of Kondo screening to
unconventional pairs. We discuss the experimental signatures of such a weakly
first order transition and the resulting phase diagram. Also, we demonstrate
the possibility of a finite-momentum pairing due to coupling of
superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, and discuss possible relations to the
pair- and charge- density waves, recently observed in UTe$_2$.

<h3>Fermi Surface Symmetric Mass Generation</h3>

Symmetric mass generation is a novel mechanism to give gapless fermions a
mass gap by non-perturbative interactions without generating any fermion
bilinear condensation. The previous studies of symmetric mass generation have
been limited to Dirac/Weyl/Majorana fermions with zero Fermi volume in the free
fermion limit. In this work, we generalize the concept of symmetric mass
generation to Fermi liquid with a finite Fermi volume and discuss how to gap
out the Fermi surfaces by interactions without breaking the U(1) loop group
symmetry or developing topological orders. We provide examples of Fermi surface
symmetric mass generation in both (1+1)D and (2+1)D Fermi liquid systems when
several Fermi surfaces together cancel the Fermi surface anomaly. However, the
U(1) loop group symmetry in these cases is still restrictive enough to rule out
all possible fermion bilinear gapping terms, such that a non-perturbative
interaction mechanism is the only way to gap out the Fermi surfaces. This
symmetric Fermi surface reconstruction is in contrast to the conventional
symmetry-breaking mechanism to gap the Fermi surfaces. As a side product, our
model provides a pristine 1D lattice regularization for the (1+1)D U(1)
symmetric chiral fermion model (e.g., the 3-4-5-0 model) by utilizing a lattice
translation symmetry as an emergent U(1) symmetry at low energy. This opens up
the opportunity for efficient numerical simulations of chiral fermions in their
own dimensions without introducing mirror fermions under the domain wall
fermion construction.
