<h3>Dynamical chiral magnetic current and instability in Weyl semimetals</h3>

Weyl semimetals realize massless relativistic fermions with two Weyl nodes
separated in energy and momentum space, whose low-energy physics is described
by Dirac fermions with an axial gauge constant. Here, we study their
electromagnetic linear responses based on the effective field theory and on the
chiral kinetic theory. Although the static chiral magnetic effect is canceled
by the Chern-Simons current under the Pauli-Villars regularization, a dynamical
magnetic field is found capable of driving an electric current along its
direction, with the total transported charge being independent of temperature
and chemical potential for a uniform field. We also incorporate dissipation in
the relaxation-time approximation and study collective excitations coupled with
Maxwell electromagnetic fields. Their dispersion relations at low frequency and
long wavelength are determined only by electric, chiral magnetic, and anomalous
Hall conductivities, which predict unstable modes leading to anisotropic
generation of electromagnetic waves oriented to the direction of Weyl node
separation.

<h3>Positivity bounds on effective field theories with spontaneously broken Lorentz invariance</h3>

We derive positivity bounds on EFT coefficients in theories where boosts are
spontaneously broken. We employ the analytic properties of the retarded Green's
function of conserved currents (or of the stress-energy tensor) and assume the
theory becomes conformal in the UV. The method is general and applicable to
both cosmology and condensed matter systems. As a concrete example, we look at
the EFT of conformal superfluids which describes the universal low-energy
dynamics of CFT's at large chemical potential and we derive inequalities on the
coefficients of the operators, in three dimensions, at NLO and NNLO.
