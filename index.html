<h3>Hydrodynamic properties of the perfect hard-sphere crystal: Microscopic  computations with Helfand moments</h3>

Within the framework of the local-equilibrium approach, the equilibrium and
nonequilibrium properties relevant to the hydrodynamics of the perfect
hard-sphere crystal are obtained with molecular dynamics simulations using the
Helfand moments associated with momentum and energy transports. Since this
crystal is face-centered cubic, the hydrodynamic properties we consider are the
hydrostatic pressure, the isothermal bulk modulus, the specific heat capacities
and their ratio, the three isothermal elastic constants
$(C_{11}^T,C_{12}^T,C_{44}^T)$, the heat conductivity, and the three
viscosities $(\eta_{11},\eta_{12},\eta_{44})$ (in Voigt's notations). These
properties are computed as a function of the particle density. The pressure and
the transport coefficients diverge near the close-packing density, as the
collision frequency per particle does.

<h3>"Tattered" membrane</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00752" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00752</a>
<br>

Ideal crystalline membranes, realized by graphene and other atomic
monolayers, exhibit rich physics - a universal anomalous elasticity of the
critical "flat" phase characterized by a negative Poisson ratio, universally
singular elastic moduli, order-from-disorder and a crumpling transition. We
formulate a generalized $D$-dimensional field theory, parameterized by an
$O(d)\times O(D)$ tensor field with an {\it energetic} longitudinal constraint.
For a soft constraint the resulting field theory describes a new class of a
fluctuating "tattered" membranes, exhibiting a nonzero density of topological
connectivity defects - slits, cracks and faults at an effective medium level.
For hard, infinite-coupling constraint, the model reproduces the conventional
crystalline membrane and its crumpling transition, and thereby demonstrates the
essence of the difference between an elastic membrane and conventional field
theories. Two additional fixed points emerge within the critical manifold, (i)
globally attractive, "isotropic" $O(d)\times O(D)$, and (ii) "transverse",
which in $D=2$ is the exact "dual" of the elastic membrane. Their properties
are obtained in general $D,d$ from the renormalization group and the
self-consistent screening analyses.

<h3>Quantifying Intuition: Bayesian Approach to Figures of Merit in EXAFS  Analysis of Magic Size Clusters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00763" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00763</a>
<br>
<i>Lucy Haddad, Diego Gianolio, David J. Dunstan, Andrei Sapelkina</i>
<br>
<br>
Analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield
local structural information in magic size clusters even when other structural
methods (such as X-ray diffraction) fail, but typically requires an initial
guess -- an atomistic model. Model comparison is thus one of the most crucial
steps in establishing atomic structure of nanoscale systems and relies
critically on the corresponding figures of merit (delivered by the data
analysis) to make a decision on the most suitable model of atomic arrangements.
However, none of the currently used statistical figures of merit take into
account such significant factor as parameter correlations. Here we show that
ignoring such correlations may result in a selection of an incorrect structural
model. We then report on a new metric based on Bayes theorem that addresses
this problem. We show that our new metric is superior to the currently used in
EXAFS analysis as it reliably yields correct structural models even in cases
when other statistical criteria may fail. We then demonstrate the utility of
the new figure of merit in comparison of structural models for CdS magic-size
clusters using EXAFS data.

<h3>Coupled spin-lattice dynamics from the tight-binding electronic  structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00765" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00765</a>
<br>
<i>Ramon Cardias, Simon Streib, Zhiwei Lu, Manuel Pereiro, Anders Bergman, Erik Sj√∂qvist, Cyrille Barreteau, Anna Delin, Olle Eriksson, Danny Thonig</i>
<br>
<br>
We developed a method which performs the coupled adiabatic spin and lattice
dynamics based on the tight-binding electronic structure model, where the
intrinsic magnetic field and ionic forces are calculated from the converged
self-consistent electronic structure at every time step. By doing so, this
method allows us to explore limits where the physics described by a
parameterized spin-lattice Hamiltonian is no longer accurate. We demonstrate
how the lattice dynamics is strongly influenced by the underlying magnetic
configuration, where disorder is able to induce significant lattice
distortions. The presented method requires significantly less computational
resources than ab initio methods, such as time-dependent density functional
theory (TD-DFT). Compared to parameterized Hamiltonian-based methods, it also
describes more accurately the dynamics of the coupled spin and lattice degrees
of freedom, which becomes important outside of the regime of small lattice and
spin fluctuations.

<h3>Rational design of oxide catalysts for OER with OC22</h3>

<br>
The efficiency of $H_2$ production via water electrolysis is typically
limited to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As such, significant
emphasis has been placed upon improving the rate of OER through the anode
catalyst. More recently, the Open Catalyst 2022 (OC22) has provided a large
dataset of density functional theory (DFT) calculated oxide catalysts for OER.
When coupled with state-of-the-art graph neural network models, total energy
predictions can be achieved with a mean absolute error as low as of 0.22 eV. In
this work, we demonstrate the full utility of the OC22 framework by
constructing a database of the total energy predictions for all slabs and OER
surface intermediates for the 3,989 oxide materials in the original OC22
dataset. This expansion includes all terminations of all facets up to a maximum
Miller index of 1 with adsorption configurations for the three OER
intermediates: $O^*$, $OH^*$ and a subset of $OOH^*$. We considered two
thermodynamic models to interpret surface energy: a "variant" model where
surface energy is a function of metal concentration and an "invariant" model
where surface energy is fixed at the equilibrium conditions for OER. We
validated the predicted overpotentials of these stable surfaces with quantities
from the experimental literature as well as our own DFT calculations. We then
constructed a screening framework to identify viable candidate anode catalysts
for OER by assessing the price, thermodynamic stability, resistance to
corrosion, surface stability, and overpotential. Finally we verified the
overpotentials and reaction energies of the final candidate catalysts using
DFT.

<h3>Electronic, Optical and Elastic Properties of Perovskite  CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3): Using First Principles Study</h3>

<br>
<br>
The structural, electronic, optical and elastic properties of perovskites of
the $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-phase family CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ (x = 0,
1, 2, 3) are analyzed by ab initio methods using GGA, SCAN and HSE06. It is
found that the lattice constants of CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ decrease with
decreasing anion size from I to Cl, and when passing from CsSnI$_3$ to
CsSnCl$_3$, the band gap width decreases slightly at the beginning and then
increases. The optical characteristics were evaluated and it was found that the
$\alpha$-, $\beta$-phase of CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ at $x=1$ has a wide absorption
range and high absorption coefficients compared to other Cl concentrations. The
elastic constants of $\alpha$-CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ perovskite have been
calculated and their bulk moduli, shear moduli, sound velocities and Debye
temperatures under pressure in the range from 0 to 30 GPa have been considered,
with the external pressure induction increasing in steps of 5 GPa. These
materials are found to be mechanically stable perovskites according to Born
stability criteria and low bulk moduli. Thus, we predict that perovskites of
the CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ family are good candidates for optical materials used
in solar cells.

<h3>Accelerating Electronic Stopping Power Predictions by 10 Million Times  with a Combination of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory and Machine  Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00787</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Knowing the rate at which particle radiation releases energy in a material,
the stopping power, is key to designing nuclear reactors, medical treatments,
semiconductor and quantum materials, and many other technologies. While the
nuclear contribution to stopping power, i.e., elastic scattering between atoms,
is well understood in the literature, the route for gathering data on the
electronic contribution has for decades remained costly and reliant on many
simplifying assumptions, including that materials are isotropic. We establish a
method that combines time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and
machine learning to reduce the time to assess new materials to mere hours on a
supercomputer and provides valuable data on how atomic details influence
electronic stopping. Our approach uses TDDFT to compute the electronic stopping
contributions to stopping power from first principles in several directions and
then machine learning to interpolate to other directions at rates 10 million
times higher. We demonstrate the combined approach in a study of proton
irradiation in aluminum and employ it to predict how the depth of maximum
energy deposition, the "Bragg Peak," varies depending on incident angle -- a
quantity otherwise inaccessible to modelers. The lack of any experimental
information requirement makes our method applicable to most materials, and its
speed makes it a prime candidate for enabling quantum-to-continuum models of
radiation damage. The prospect of reusing valuable TDDFT data for training the
model make our approach appealing for applications in the age of materials data
science.

<h3>Random-search efficiency in a bounded interval with spatially  heterogeneous diffusion coefficient</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00818</a>
<br>
<i>L. Menon Jr, M. A. F. dos Santos, C. Anteneodo</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider random walkers searching for a target in a bounded
one-dimensional heterogeneous environment, in the interval $[0,L]$, where
diffusion is described by a space-dependent diffusion coefficient $D(x)$.
Boundary conditions are absorbing at the position of the target (set at $x=0$)
and reflecting at the border $x=L$. We calculate and compare the estimates of
efficiency $\varepsilon_1=\langle 1/ t\rangle$ and $\varepsilon_2=1/\langle t
\rangle$. For the Stratonovich framework of the multiplicative random process,
both measures are analytically calculated for arbitrary $D(x)$. For other
interpretations of the stochastic integrals (e.g., It\^o and anti-It\^o), we
get general results for $\varepsilon_2$, while $\varepsilon_1$ is obtained for
particular forms of $D(x)$. The impact of the diffusivity profile on these
measures of efficiency is discussed. Symmetries and peculiar properties arise
when the search starts at the border ($x_0=L$), in particular, heterogeneity
spoils the efficiency of the search within the Stratonovich framework, while
for other interpretations the searcher can perform better in certain
heterogeneous diffusivity profiles.

<h3>Silicon Implantation and Annealing in $Œ≤$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: Role of  Ambient, Temperature, and Time</h3>

<br>
<br>
Optimizing thermal anneals of Si-implanted $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is critical
for low resistance contacts and selective area doping. We report the impact of
annealing ambient, temperature, and time on activation of room temperature
ion-implanted Si in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ at concentrations from 5x10$^{18}$ to
1x10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, demonstrating full activation (>80% activation,
mobilities >70 cm$^{2}$/Vs) with contact resistances below 0.29 $\Omega$-mm.
Homoepitaxial $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films, grown by plasma assisted MBE on
Fe-doped (010) substrates, were implanted at multiple energies to yield 100 nm
box profiles of 5x10$^{18}$, 5x10$^{19}$, and 1x10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. Anneals
were performed in a UHV-compatible quartz furnace at 1 bar with well-controlled
gas composition. To maintain $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ stability, $p_{O2}$ must be
greater than 10$^{-9}$ bar. Anneals up to $p_{O2}$ = 1 bar achieve full
activation at 5x10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, while 5x10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ must be
annealed with $p_{O2}$ <10$^{-4}$ bar and 1x10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ requires
$p_{O2}$ <10$^{-6}$ bar. Water vapor prevents activation and must be maintained
below 10$^{-8}$ bar. Activation is achieved for anneal temperatures as low as
850 {\deg}C with mobility increasing with anneal temperature up to 1050
{\deg}C, though Si diffusion has been reported above 950 {\deg}C. At 950
{\deg}C, activation is maximized between 5 and 20 minutes with longer times
resulting in decreased carrier activation (over-annealing). This over-annealing
is significant for concentrations above 5x10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ and occurs
rapidly at 1x10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. RBS (channeling) suggests damage recovery is
seeded from remnant aligned $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ that remains after
implantation; this conclusion is also supported by STEM showing retention of
the $\beta$-phase with inclusions that resemble the $\gamma$-phase.

<h3>Phonon-induced geometric chirality</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Chiral phonons conventionally describe circularly polarized lattice
vibrations that carry angular momentum and that represent a case of dynamic
chirality. Here, we demonstrate that linearly polarized phonons can also induce
geometric chirality in achiral crystals when excited nonlinearly with an
ultrashort laser pulse. We show that nonlinear phonon coupling can be used to
quasistatically displace the crystal structure along the eigenvectors of phonon
modes that reduce the symmetry of the lattice to that of the enantiomorphic
point groups characterizing chiral crystals. The structure can be switched
between the two enantiomers by reorienting the polarization of the laser pulse.
These linearly polarized chiral phonons enable the creation of chiral crystal
geometries on demand and offer a novel pathway towards engineering chiral
electronic states and optical properties.

<h3>Interfacial defect properties of high-entropy carbides: Stacking faults,  Shockley partial dislocations, and a new Evans-Polanyi-Semenov relation</h3>

<br>
<i>Samuel E. Daigle, Stefano Curtarolo, William G. Fahrenholtz, Jon-Paul Maria, Douglas E. Wolfe, Eva Zurek, Donald W. Brenner</i>
<br>
<br>
Using first principles calculations, {111} intrinsic stacking fault (ISF)
energies in Group IVB, VB, and VIB high-entropy transition metal carbides are
shown to be predictable from an optimized rule of mixtures based on the
properties of the single metal carbide constituents present near the stacking
fault. A composition-independent linear relationship is demonstrated between
the ISF energies and the unstable stacking fault (USF) energies along the
<112>{111} gamma surface slip path. Treating the ISF and USF energies as
analogous to the heat of reaction and transition state barrier in chemical
reactions, this linear relationship represents a new application of the
Evans-Polanyi-Semenov principle. Further, a full defect energy distribution can
be obtained from the predicted ISF energies with only the composition as an
input for the mixed early-transition metal carbides. Applying a model that
balances the elastic repulsion between partial dislocations with the
distribution of ISF energies, we show that Shockley partial edge dislocations
should remain bound for all valence electron concentration values up to about
9.6, even when the average stacking fault energy is negative.

<br>
<br>
The superconductor Nb$_3$Sn has a high critical temperature and high critical
field, widely used for high-field superconducting magnets. In this work we
investigate its microscopic electronic structure with $^{93}$Nb nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). The high-quality Nb$_3$Sn powder sample was studied
in both 3.2T and 7T magnetic fields in the temperature range from 1.5K to 300K.
From measurement of the spectrum and its theoretical analysis, we find evidence
for anisotropy despite its cubic crystal structure. This anisotropy is manifest
in alignment of powder grains under certain temperature and field cycling
conditions. The Knight shift and spin-lattice relaxation rate, $T_1^{-1}$, were
measured in the normal state. Additionally, $T_1^{-1}$ was measured in the
superconducting state and compared with BCS theory revealing a weak field
dependence, with an energy gap $\Delta(0)=2.0\pm0.08k_B T_c$ at 3.2T and
$\Delta(0)=1.73\pm0.08k_B T_c$ at 7T, indicating suppression of the order
parameter by magnetic field.

<h3>High-Temperature Effects for Transition State Calculations in Solids</h3>

Transition state calculation is a critical technique to understand and
predict versatile dynamical phenomena in solids. However, the transition state
results obtained at zero Kelvin are often utilized for prediction or
interpretation of dynamical processes at high temperatures, and the error bars
of such approximation are largely unknown. In this benchmark study, all the
major temperature effects including lattice expansion, lattice vibration,
electron excitation, and band-edge shift are evaluated with first-principles
calculations for defects diffusion in solids. With inclusion of these
temperature effects, the notable discrepancies between theoretical predictions
at zero Kelvin and the experimental diffusivities at high temperatures are
dramatically reduced. Particularly, we find that the lattice expansion and
lattice vibration are dominant factors lowering the defect formation energies
and hopping barriers at high temperatures, but the electron excitation exhibits
minor effects. In sharp contrast to typical assumption, the attempt frequency
with lattice expansion and vibration varies significantly with materials:
several THz for aluminum bulk but surprisingly over 500 THz for 4H-SiC. For
defects in semiconductors, the band-edge shift is also significant at high
temperatures and plays a vital role in the defect diffusion. We expect this
study would help accurately predict the dynamical processes at high
temperatures.

<h3>Crater Depth Prediction in Granular Collisions: A Uniaxial Compression  Model</h3>

Impact crater experiments in granular media traditionally involve loosely
packed sand targets. However, this study investigates granular impact craters
on both loosely and more tightly packed sand targets. We report granular vs.
granular experiments that consistently adhere to power-law scaling laws for
diameter as a function of impacting energy, similar to those reported by other
groups for their experiments utilizing both solid and granular projectiles. In
contrast, we observe significant deviations in the depth vs. energy power-law
predicted by previous models. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a
physical model of uniaxial compression that explains how depth saturates in
granular collisions. Furthermore, we present an energy balance alongside this
model that aligns well with our crater volume measurements and describes the
energy transfer mechanisms acting during crater formation. Central peak
formation also plays an essential role in better transferring vertical momentum
to horizontal degrees of freedom, resulting in shallow craters on compacted
sandbox targets. Our results reveal a depth-to-diameter aspect ratio of
approximately $\sim 1/5$, allowing us to interpret the shallowness of planetary
craters in light of the uniaxial compression mechanism proposed in this work.

We present a novel heterostructured approach to disentangle the mechanism of
electrical transport of the strongly correlated PrNiO3, by placing the
nickelate under the photoconductor CdS. This enables the injection of carriers
into PrNiO3 in a controlled way, which can be used to interrogate its intrinsic
transport mechanism. We find a non-volatile resistance decrease when
illuminating the system at temperatures below the PrNiO3 metal-insulator
transition. The photoinduced change becomes more volatile as the temperature
increases. These data help understand the intrinsic transport properties of the
nickelate-CdS bilayer. Together with data from a bare PrNiO3 film, we find that
the transport mechanism includes a combination of mechanisms including both
thermal activation and variable range hopping. At low temperatures without
photoinduced carriers the transport is governed by hopping, while at higher
temperatures and intense illumination the activation mechanism becomes
relevant. This work shows a new way to optically control the low-temperature
resistance of PrNiO3.

<h3>Planar Aerogel and Superfluid $^3$He, Structure and Transitions</h3>

Anisotropic aerogel possesses structure which exhibits a strong influence
over the composition and orientation of the order parameter of imbibed
superfluid $^3$He. Computational studies have identified stretched aerogel with
plane-like structures and compressed aerogel with nematic-like structures.
Studies of the B phase of superfluid $^3$He in stretched aerogel display an
enhanced nuclear magnetic susceptibility likely caused by Andreev bound states
near plane-like impurity sites. We report further details on the influence of
these planar structures on both magnetic and orbital orientation transitions.
The orbital orientation transitions appear in both the B and A phases of
stretched and compressed aerogels. These transitions result from a crossover of
the superfluid coherence length with long and short length scale structure with
the coherence length and are consequently magnetic field independent.
Additionally, the apparent temperature-independence of the susceptibility of
the B phase equal to that of the A phase in stretched aerogel, is in marked
contrast with the field dependence of the superfluid A to B phase transition,
indicating that it is a near-isentropic transition.

<br>
<br>
Manipulation of the valley degree of freedom provides a novel paradigm in
quantum information technology. Here, through first-principles calculations and
model analysis, we demonstrate that monolayer Cr$_2$COOH MXene is a promising
candidate material for valleytronics applications. We reveal that Cr$_2$COOH is
a ferromagnetic semiconductor and harbors valley features. Due to the
simultaneous breaking inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry, the
valleys are polarized spontaneously. Moreover, the valley polarization is
sizeable in both the valence and conduction bands, benefiting the observation
of the anomalous valley Hall effect. More remarkably, the valley splitting can
be effectively tuned by the magnetization direction, strain and ferroelectric
substrate. More interestingly, the ferroelectric substrate Sc$_2$CO$_2$ can not
only regulate the MAE, but also tune valley polarization state. Our findings
offer a practical way for realizing highly tunable valleys by multiferroic
couplings.

<h3>Floquet engineering in the presence of optically excited carriers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Floquet engineering provides an optical means to manipulate electronic
bandstructures, however, carriers excited by the pump field can lead to an
effective heating, and can obscure measurement of the band changes. A recent
demonstration of the effects of Floquet engineering on a coherent ensemble of
excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ proved particularly sensitive to non-adiabatic
effects, while still being able to accurately resolve bandstructure changes.
Here, we drive an AC-Stark effect in monolayer WS$_2$ using pulses with
constant fluence but varying pulse duration (from 25-235~fs). With shorter pump
pulses, the corresponding increase in peak intensity introduces additional
carriers via two-photon absorption, leading to additional decoherence and peak
broadening (which makes it difficult to resolve the AC-Stark shift). We use
multidimensional coherent spectroscopy to create a coherent ensemble of
excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ and measure the evolution of the coherence
throughout the duration of the Floquet pump pulse. Changes to the amplitude of
the macroscopic coherence quantifies the additional broadening. At the same
time, the evolution of the average phase allows the instantaneous changes to
the bandstructure to be quantified, and is not impacted by the additional
broadening. This approach to measuring the evolution of Floquet-Bloch states
demonstrates a means to quantify effective heating and non-adiabaticity caused
by excited carriers, while at the same time resolving the coherent evolution of
the bandstructure.

2-TIPS (Two Temperature induced phase separation) refers to the phase
separation phenomenon observed in mixtures of active and passive particles
which are modelled using scalar activity. The active particles are connected to
a thermostat at high temperature while the passive particles are connected to
the thermostat at low temperature and the relative temperature difference
between "hot" and "cold" particles is taken as the measure of the activity of
the non-equilibrium system. The study of such binary mixtures of hot and cold
particles under various kinds of confinement is an important problem in many
physical and biological processes. The nature and extent of phase separation
are heavily influenced by the geometry of confinement, activity, and density of
the non-equilibrium binary mixture. Investigating such 3D binary mixtures
confined by parallel walls, we observe that, the active and passive particles
phase separate, but the extent of phase separation is reduced compared to bulk
phase separation at high densities and enhanced at low densities. However, when
the binary mixture of active and passive particles is confined inside a
spherical cavity, the phase separation is radial for small radii of the
confining sphere and the extent of phase separation is higher compared to their
bulk counterparts. Confinement leads to interesting properties in the
passive(cold) region like enhanced layering and high compression in the
direction parallel to the confining wall. In 2D, both the bulk and confined
systems of the binary mixture show a significant decrement in the extent of
phase separation at higher densities. This observation is attributed to the
trapping of active particles inside the passive cluster, which increases with
density. similar phase co-existence.

<br>
We provide bulk transport evidence for twin-boundary pinning of vortices in
FeSe. We measure interlayer resistance in FeSe in magnetic fields and find
that, as the field is rotated in the $ab$ plane, the flux-flow resistivity is
suppressed when the field direction is parallel to twinning planes. The width
of the associated dip in the resistance vs in-plane field direction curve
varies as $T^{1/2}B^{-3/4}$, consistent with the creation of kinked vortices
near the parallel field geometry.

Two-dimensional (2D) magnets have transformative potential in spintronics
applications. In this study, we use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to accelerate
the discovery of novel 2D magnetic materials. Using data from the Materials
Project database and the Computational 2D materials database (C2DB), we train
three GNN architectures on a dataset of 1190 magnetic monolayers with energy
above the convex hull $E_{\text{hull}}$ less than 0.3 eV/atom. Our Crystal
Diffusion Variational Auto Encoder (CDVAE) generates around 11,000 material
candidates. Subsequent training on two Atomistic Line Graph Neural Networks
(ALIGNN) achieves a 93$\%$ accuracy in predicting magnetic monolayers and a
mean average error of 0.039 eV/atom for $E_{\text{hull}}$ predictions. After
narrowing down candidates based on magnetic likelihood and predicted energy,
and constraining the atom count in the monolayer to four or fewer, we
identified 158 candidates. These are validated using Density-Functional Theory
(DFT) to confirm their magnetic and energetic favorability resulting in 150
materials magnetic monolayer with $E_{\text{hull}} < 0.3$ eV/atom. Our
methodology offers a way to accelerate exploring and predicting potential 2D
magnetic materials, contributing to the ongoing computational and experimental
efforts aimed at the discovery of new 2D magnets.

We investigated the transport properties in a normal metal/ferromagnet/normal
metal/superconductor junction based on semi-Dirac materials with inverted
energy gap. With a scattering matrix approach, we show that the electron
transport in the junction is spin-valley-polarized due to the ferromagnetic
exchange energy. It is also shown that the Andreev reflection is strongly
suppressed, which is a clear experimental signal for the
spin-valley-polarization in semi-Dirac materials.

<br>

Twisted 2D layered materials have garnered a lot of attention recently as a
class of 2D materials whose interlayer interactions and electronic properties
are dictated by the relative rotation / twist angle between the adjacent
layers. In this work, we explore a prototype of such a twisted 2D system,
artificially stacked twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), where we probe the
changes in the interlayer interactions and electron-phonon scattering pathways
as the twist angle is varied from 0{\deg} to 30{\deg}, using Raman
spectroscopy. The long range Moir\'e potential of the superlattice gives rise
to additional intravalley and intervalley scattering of the electrons in TBLG
which have been investigated through their Raman signatures. The density
functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electronic band structure of the
TBLG superlattices was found to be in agreement with the resonant Raman
excitations across the van Hove singularities in the valence and conduction
bands predicted for TBLG due to hybridization of bands from the two layers. We
also observe that the relative rotation between the graphene layers has a
marked influence on the second order overtone and combination Raman modes
signalling a commensurate-incommensurate transition in TBLG as the twist angle
increases. This serves as a convenient and rapid characterization tool to
determine the degree of commensurability in TBLG systems.

<h3>Electronic properties and surface states of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Locally noncentrosymmetric CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ exhibits characteristic
two-phase unconventional $H$--$T$ superconducting phase diagram. The transition
from even- to odd-parity superconducting phase is supported by the P4/nmm
crystal structure and it can be induced by the external magnetic field. Dual
nature of the Ce $f$ electrons and competition between their itinerant and
localized nature can be important for its physical proprieties. The existing
electronic band structure in this material is still under debate. Energy scale
occurring in the system can be important for adequate theoretical description
of its supercomputing properties. In this paper, we discuss electronic band
structure obtained from {\it ab initio} calculations. We analyze electronic
surface states which can be compared with recently obtained angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurement (ARPES). Additionally, we present the
analyses of the hopping parameters obtained from the electronic band structure.
The As-Rh layers are characterized by much more significant hopping parameters
between atoms than these obtained for the Ce-Ce atoms. This suggests need of a
revision of the tight binding model necessary for adequate description of the
physical properties of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$.

<br>
<br>
Using first-principles techniques, we study the structural, magnetic and
electronic properties of (111)-oriented
(LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$$\vert$(SrMnO$_3$)$_{n}$ superlattices of varying thickness
($n=2,4,6$). We find that the properties of the thinnest superlattice ($n=2$)
are similar to the celebrated half-metallic ferromagnetic alloy
La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$, with quenched Jahn-Teller distortions. At
intermediate thickness ($n=4$), the $a^{-}a^{-}a^{-}$ tilting pattern
transitions to the $a^{-}a^{-}c^{+}$ tilting pattern, driven by the lattice
degrees of freedom in the LaMnO$_3$ region. The emergence of the Jahn-Teller
modes and the spatial extent needed for their development play a key role in
this structural transition. For the largest thickness considered ($n=6$), we
unveil an emergent separation of Jahn-Teller and volume-breathing orders in the
ground-state structure with the $a^{-}a^{-}c^{+}$ tilting pattern, whereas it
vanishes in the antiferromagnetic configurations. The ground state of all
superlattices is half-metallic ferromagnetic, not affected by the underlying
series of structural transitions. Overall, these results outline a
thickness-induced crossover between the physical properties of bulk
La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ and bulk LaMnO$_3$.

<h3>Auxiliary master equation approach to the Anderson-Holstein impurity  problem out of equilibrium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01095" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01095</a>
<br>
<i>D. Werner, R. ≈Ωitko, E. Arrigoni</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a method based on auxiliary master equation for solving the
problem of an impurity with local electron-electron and electron-phonon
interaction embedded between two conduction leads with a finite bias voltage.
The Anderson-Holstein Hamiltonian is transformed to a corresponding Lindblad
equation with a reduced set of sites providing an optimal approximation of the
hybridization function. The problem is solved in the superfermion
representation using configuration interaction for fermions and bosons. The
phonon basis is shifted and rotated with the intention of permitting a low
phonon basis cutoff even in the strong-coupling regime. We benchmark this
approach with the numerical renormalization group in equilibrium, finding
excellent agreement. We observe, however, that the rotation brings no advantage
beyond the bare shift. This is even more apparent out of equilibrium, where
issues in convergence with respect to the size of the phononic Hilbert space
occur only in the rotated basis. As an application of the method, we explore
the evolution of the phononic peak in the differential conductance spectra with
changing phonon frequency.

<h3>Gapped boundaries of fermionic topological orders and higher central  charges</h3>

<br>
<br>
We develop a test for the vanishing of higher central charges of a fermionic
topological order, which is a necessary condition for the existence of a gapped
boundary, purely in terms of the modular data of the super-modular tensor
category. More precisely, we test whether a given super-MTC has $c = 0$ mod
$\frac{1}{2}$, and, if so, whether the modular extension with $c =0$ mod $8$
has vanishing higher central charges. The test itself does not require an
explicit computation of the modular extensions and is easily carried out. We
apply this test to known examples of super-modular tensor categories. Since our
test allows us to obtain information about the chiral central charge of a
super-modular tensor category in terms of its modular data without direct
knowledge of its modular extensions, this can also be thought of as the first
step towards a fermionic analogue of the Gauss-Milgram formula.

<h3>Unified Hierarchical Relationship Between Thermodynamic Tradeoff  Relations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent years have witnessed a surge of discoveries in the studies of
thermodynamic inequalities: the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) and
the entropic bound (EB) provide a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) in
terms of nonequilibrium currents; the classical speed limit (CSL) expresses the
lower bound on the EP using the geometry of probability distributions; the
power-efficiency (PE) tradeoff dictates the maximum power achievable for a heat
engine given the level of its thermal efficiency. In this study, we show that
there exists a unified hierarchical structure encompassing all of these bounds,
with the fundamental inequality given by a novel extension of the TUR (XTUR)
that incorporates the most general range of current-like and state-dependent
observables. By selecting more specific observables, the TUR and the EB follow
from the XTUR, and the CSL and the PE tradeoff follow from the EB. Our
derivations cover both Langevin and Markov jump systems, with the first proof
of the EB for the Markov jump systems and a more generalized form of the CSL.
We also present concrete examples of the EB for the Markov jump systems and the
generalized CSL.

<h3>Dissimilar thermal transport properties in $Œ∫$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and  $Œ≤$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ revealed by machine-learning homogeneous nonequilibrium  molecular dynamics simulations</h3>

<br>
<br>
The lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) of Ga$_2$O$_3$ is an important
property due to the challenge in the thermal management of high-power devices.
We develop machine-learned neuroevolution potentials for single-crystalline
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and apply them to perform
homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to predict their
LTCs. The LTC of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ was determined to be 10.3 $\pm$ 0.2 W/(m
K), 19.9 $\pm$ 0.2 W/(m K), and 12.6 $\pm$ 0.2 W/(m K) along [100], [010], and
[001], respectively, aligning with previous experimental measurements. For the
first time, we predict the LTC of $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ along [100], [010], and
[001] to be 4.5 $\pm$ 0.0 W/(m K), 3.9 $\pm$ 0.0 W/(m K), and 4.0 $\pm$ 0.1
W/(m K), respectively, showing a nearly isotropic thermal transport property.
The reduced LTC of $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ versus $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ stems from
its restricted low-frequency phonons up to 5 THz. Furthermore, we find that the
$\beta$ phase exhibits a typical temperature dependence slightly stronger than
$\sim T^{-1}$, whereas the $\kappa$ phase shows a weaker temperature
dependence, ranging from $\sim T^{-0.5}$ to $\sim T^{-0.7}$.

<h3>First order phase transition in the few-body XY-models with surface  fields</h3>

We investigate the one-dimensional finite-size XY model with opposing surface
fields in the X direction. Exact solutions are obtained for the two-site and
three-site models, while numerical methods are employed for models with more
than three sites. Remarkably, first-order quantum phase transitions are
observed in this system. At the phase transition point, the energy gap closes
linearly, and the magnetization at each site undergoes a discontinuous jump.
Additionally, we identify a $Z_2$ symmetry that accompanies the phase
transition and its associated symmetry change. Notably, the first-order phase
transition in finite-size systems does not exhibit the conventional finite-size
rounding effect. On the contrary, there exists a counterintuitive finite-size
effect: the amplitude of the jump in magnetization at each site decreases as
the lattice size increases. Interestingly, lattices with an even number of
sites share a common phase boundary, while lattices with an odd number of sites
have a distinct phase boundary.

The modelling of heterogeneous and architected materials poses a significant
challenge, demanding advanced homogenisation techniques. However, the
complexity of this task can be considerably simplified through the application
of micropolar elasticity. Conversely, elastic foundation theory is widely
employed in fracture mechanics and the analysis of delamination propagation in
composite materials. This study aims to amalgamate these two frameworks,
enhancing the elastic foundation theory to accommodate materials exhibiting
micropolar behaviour. Specifically, we present a novel theory of elastic
foundation for micropolar materials, employing stress potentials formulation
and a unique normalisation approach. Closed-form solutions are derived for
stress and couple stress reactions inherent in such materials, along with the
associated restoring stiffness. The validity of the proposed theory is
established through verification using the double cantilever beam
configuration. Concluding our study, we elucidate the benefits and limitations
of the developed theory by quantifying the derived parameters for materials
known to exhibit micropolar behaviour. This integration of micropolar
elasticity into the elastic foundation theory not only enhances our
understanding of material responses but also provides a versatile framework for
the analysis of heterogeneous materials in various engineering applications.

We present a theory of weak localization (WL) in the presence of generic
spin-dependent fields, including any type of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman
fields, and non-homogeneous magnetic textures. We go beyond the usual diffusive
approximation, considering systems with arbitrary disorder, and obtain a
compact expression for the weak localization (WL) correction to the
conductivity in terms of the singlet-triplet polarization operator in momentum
space. The latter can be directly related to the solution of the quasiclassical
Eilenberger equation for superconducting systems. This formulation presents an
intuitive framework to explore how the interplay of various spin-dependent
fields drives weak (anti) localization. We apply our results to study in-plane
magnetoconductivity in systems with spin-orbit coupling, and in newly
discovered altermagnets. Our results enable straightforward calculation of the
WL conductivity at arbitrary disorder, which can be particularly useful for
interpreting experiments on high-mobility samples.

Colloidal particles can spontaneously self-assemble into ordered structures,
which not only can manipulate the propagation of light, but also vibration or
phonons. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we study the self-assembly of perfectly
aligned segment rod particles with lateral flat cutting. Under the help of
surface attractions, we find that particles with different cutting degree can
self-assemble into different crystal phases characterized by bond coordination
$z$ that varies from 3 to 6. Importantly, we identify a transformable
super-isostatic structures with \emph{pgg} symmetry and redundant bonds
($z=5$). We find that this structure can support either the soft bulk model or
soft edge model depending on its Poisson's ratio which can be tuned from
positive to negative by a uniform soft deformation. Importantly, the bulk soft
modes are associated with states of self-stress along the direction of zero
strain during the uniform soft deformation. This self-assembled transformable
super-isostatic structure may act as mechanical metamaterials with potential
application in micro-mechanical engineering.

Humans rely on multimodal perception to form representations of the world.
This implies that environmental stimuli must remain consistent and predictable
throughout their journey to our sensory organs. When it comes to vision,
electromagnetic waves are minimally affected when passing through air or glass
treated for chromatic aberrations. Similar conclusions can be drawn for hearing
and acoustic waves. However, tools that propagate elastic waves to our
cutaneous afferents tend to color tactual perception due to parasitic
mechanical attributes such as resonances and inertia. These issues are often
overlooked, despite their critical importance for haptic devices that aim to
faithfully render or record tactile interactions. Here, we investigate how to
optimize this mechanical transmission with sandwich structures made from rigid,
lightweight carbon fiber sheets arranged around a 3D-printed lattice core.
Through a comprehensive parametric evaluation, we demonstrate that this design
paradigm provides superior haptic transparency. Drawing an analogy with
topology optimization, our solution approaches a foreseeable technological
limit. This novel medium offers a practical way to create high-fidelity haptic
interfaces, opening new avenues for research on tool-mediated interactions.

<h3>Determination of the phonon sidebands in the photoluminescence spectrum  of semiconductor nanoclusters from ab initio calculations</h3>

<br>
<i>Peng Han, Gabriel Bester</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a theoretical approach based on (constrained) density functional
theory and the Franck-Condon approximation for the calculation of the
temperature dependent photoluminescence of nanostructures. The method is
computationally advantageous and only slightly more demanding than a standard
density functional theory calculation and includes transitions into multiphonon
final states (higher class transitions). We use the approach for Si and CdSe
colloidal nanoclusters (NCs) with up to 693 atoms and obtain very good
agreement with experiment which allows us to identify specific peaks and
explain their origin. Generally, breathing type modes are shown to dominate the
phonon replicas, while optical modes have significant contributions for CdSe
NCs and play a lesser role in Si NCs. We obtain significant anti-Stokes peak
starting at 140K for Si NC explaining the broadening observed in the
corresponding experiment. We also apply the method to small molecular-like
carbon structures (diamondoids), where electron-phonon coupling is typically
large, and find that multiphonon processes (up to class 4) are very relevant
and necessary to compare favorably with experiment. While it is crucial to
include these multiphonon states in the small diamondoids with few tens of
atoms, neglecting them in only marginally larger Si$_{87}$H$_{76}$ and
Cd$_{43}$Se$_{44}$H$^*_{76}$ (and larger) quantum dots represents a good
approximation.

Time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) nonlinear current response has been
theoretically proposed and experimentally confirmed recently. However, the role
of disorder scattering in the response, especially whether it contributes to
the $\sigma_{xx}$-independent term, has not been clarified. In this work, we
derive a general scaling law for this effect, which accounts for multiple
scattering sources. We show that the nonlinear conductivity is generally a
quartic function in $\sigma_{xx}$. Besides intrinsic contribution, extrinsic
contributions from scattering also enter the zeroth order term, and their
values can be comparable to or even larger than the intrinsic one. Terms beyond
zeroth order are all extrinsic. Cubic and quartic terms must involve skew
scattering and they signal competition between at least two scattering sources.
The behavior of zeroth order extrinsic terms is explicitly demonstrated in a
Dirac model. Our finding reveals the significant role of disorder scattering in
$\mathcal{T}$-odd nonlinear transport, and establishes a foundation for
analyzing experimental result.

The topic of the present lecture notes are two-species quantum mixtures
composed of a deeply degenerate Fermi gas and a second component, the latter
being fermionic or bosonic. A key ingredient is the possibility to tune the
$s$-wave interaction between the different species by means of magnetically
controlled Feshbach resonances, which allow us to investigate regimes of strong
interactions. In two case studies, we review our experiments on mixtures of
$^6$Li fermions with fermionic $^{40}$K or bosonic $^{41}$K atoms and on
mixtures of fermionic $^{161}$Dy with $^{40}$K atoms. We cover various topics
of fermionic quantum many-body physics, ranging from impurity physics and
quasiparticles over phase separation to the formation of ultracold molecules

Moisture-capturing hydrogels have emerged as attractive sorbent materials
capable of converting ambient humidity into liquid water. Recent works have
demonstrated exceptional water capture capabilities of hydrogels, while
simultaneously, exploring different strategies to accelerate water capture and
release. However, on the material level, an understanding of the intrinsic
transport properties of moisture-capturing hydrogels is currently missing,
which hinders their rational design. In this work, we combine absorption and
desorption experiments of macroscopic hydrogel samples in pure-vapor with
models of water diffusion in the hydrogels to demonstrate the first
measurements of the intrinsic water diffusion coefficient in hydrogel-salt
composites. Based on these insights, we pattern hydrogels with micropores to
significantly decrease the required absorption and desorption time by 19% and
72%, respectively, while reducing the total water capacity of the hydrogel by
only 4%. Thereby, we provide an effective strategy towards hydrogel material
optimization, with a particular significance in pure-vapor environments.

Despite being applied with success in many fields of materials science, Raman
spectroscopy is not yet determinant in the study of electroceramics. Recent
experimental and theoretical developments, however, should increase the
popularity of Raman spectroscopy in this class of materials. In this Review, we
outline the fields of application of Raman spectroscopy and microscopy in
various electroceramic systems, defining current key bottlenecks and explaining
promising recent developments. We focus our attention to recent experimental
developments, including coupling Raman spectroscopy with other methodologies,
and modelling approaches involving both the model-based data interpretation and
the ab initio calculation of realistic Raman spectra.

Electronic correlation effects are manifested in quantum materials when
either the onsite Coulomb repulsion is large or the electron kinetic energy is
small. The former is the dominant effect in the cuprate superconductors or
heavy fermion systems while the latter in twisted bilayer graphene or
geometrically frustrated metals. However, the simultaneous cooperation of both
effects in the same quantum material--the design principle to produce a
correlated topological flat bands pinned at the Fermi level--remains rare.
Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report the
observation of a flat band at the Fermi level in a 3$d$ pyrochlore metal
CuV$_2$S$_4$. From a combination of first-principles calculations and
slave-spin calculations, we understand the origin of this band to be a
destructive quantum-interference effect associated with the V pyrochlore
sublattice and further renormalization to the Fermi level by electron
interactions in the partially filled V $t_{2g}$ orbitals. As a result, we find
transport behavior that indicates a deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior as
well as a large Sommerfeld coefficient. Our work demonstrates the pathway into
correlated topology by constructing and pinning correlated flat bands near the
Fermi level out of a pure $d$-electron system by the combined cooperation of
local Coulomb interactions and geometric frustration in a pyrochlore lattice
system.

The Niobium surface is almost always covered by a native oxide layer which
greatly influences the performance of superconducting devices. Here we
investigate the highly stable Niobium oxide overlayer of Nb(110), which is
characterised by its distinctive nanocrystal structure as observed by scanning
tunnelling microscopy (STM). Our ab-initio density functional theory (DFT)
calculations show that a subtle reconstruction in the surface Niobium atoms
gives rise to rows of 4-fold coordinated oxygen separated by regions of 3-fold
coordinated oxygen. The 4-fold oxygen rows are determined to be the source of
the nanocrystal pattern observed in STM, and the two chemical states of oxygen
observed in core-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are ascribed to
the 3-fold and 4-fold oxygens. Furthermore, we find excellent agreement between
the DFT calculated electronic structure with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy
and valence XPS measurements.

<br>
Phosphorene, a well-studied 2D allotrope of phosphorus, features unique
properties such as widely tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility, and
remarkable intrinsic in-plane anisotropy. Utilizing these structural and
electronic properties, we investigate ultrafast electron dynamics and high
harmonic generation (HHG) from phosphorene subject to band structure
engineering through external strain, based on ab initio time-dependent
density-functional theory approach. We show that strong field processes in such
systems can be optimized and controlled by biaxial tensile and compressive
strain engineering, that results in electronic structure modification. While
-10% strain resulted in closing of band gap, 2% strain increased the gap by 22%
with respect to 0.9 eV in pristine phosphorene, consequently affecting the high
harmonic yield. With reduction of gap, by applying strain from 2% to -10%, the
valence band near $\Gamma-$point becomes more flat and discreet, resulting in
large electronic density of states and enhanced electronic excitation, which
reflects in their ultrafast sub-cycle dynamics under laser excitation.
Moreover, due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, harmonic yield with laser
polarization along the armchair (AC) direction is found to be higher than that
of the zigzag (ZZ) direction for all the strain cases. Nearly, an order of
magnitude enhancement of harmonic intensity is achieved for -10% strain along
AC direction. The current study expands the research possibilities of
phosphorene into a previously unexplored domain, indicating its potential for
future utilization in extreme-ultraviolet and attosecond nanophotonics, and
also for efficient table-top HHG sources.

The emergence of topological magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals
(vdW) magnetic materials promoted 2D heterostructures as key building-blocks of
devices for information technology based on topological concepts. Here, we
demonstrate the all-electric switching of the topological nature of individual
magnetic objects emerging in 2D vdW heterobillayers. We show from the first
principles that an external electric field modifies the vdW gap between CrTe
$_2$ and (Rh, Ti)Te$_2$ layers and alters the underlying magnetic interactions.
This enables switching between ferromagnetic skyrmions and meron pairs in the
CrTe$_2$/RhTe$_2$ heterobilayer while it enhances the stability of frustrated
antiferromagnetic merons in the CrTe$_2$/TiTe$_2$ heterobilayer. We envision
that the electrical engineering of distinct topological magnetic solitons in a
single device could pave the way for novel energy-efficient mechanisms to store
and transmit information with applications in spintronics.

<h3>Heating up quadruply quantized vortices: Splitting patterns and  dynamical transitions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Using holographic duality, we investigate the impact of finite temperature on
the instability and splitting patterns of quadruply quantized vortices,
providing the first-ever analysis in this context. Through linear stability
analysis, we reveal the occurrence of two consecutive dynamical transitions. At
a specific low temperature, the dominant unstable mode transitions from the
$2$-fold rotational symmetry mode to the $3$-fold one, followed by a transition
from the $3$-fold one to the $4$-fold one at a higher temperature. As the
temperature is increased, we also observe the $5$ and $6$-fold rotational
symmetry unstable modes get excited successively. Employing the full non-linear
numerical simulations, we further demonstrate that these two novel dynamical
transitions, along with the temperature-induced instabilities for the $5$ and
$6$-fold rotational symmetry modes, can be identified by examining the
resulting distinct splitting patterns, which offers a promising route for the
experimental verification in the cold atom gases.

<h3>Quasi Two-dimensional Vortex Matter in ThH$_{10}$ Superhydride</h3>

<br>
<br>
A comprehensive study of the vortex phases and vortex dynamics is presented
for a recently discovered high-temperature superconductor ThH$_{10}$ with
$\textit{T}$$_C$ = 153 K at 170 GPa. The obtained results strongly suggest a
quasi two-dimensional (2D) character of the vortex glass phase transition in
ThH$_{10}$. The activation energy yields a logarithmic dependence
$\textit{U}$$_0$ $\propto$ ln($\textit{H}$) on magnetic field in a low field
region and a power law dependence $\textit{U}$$_0$ ~ $\textit{H}$$^{-1}$ in a
high field region, signaling a crossover from 2D regime to 3D collective
pinning regime, respectively. Additionally, a pinning force field dependence
showcases dominance of surface-type pinning in the vicinity of
$\textit{T}$$_C$. Thermal activation energy ($\textit{U}$$_0$), derived within
thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) theory, takes very high values above
2$\times$10$^5$ K together with the Ginzburg number $\textit{Gi}$ = 0.039 -
0.085, which is lower only than those of BiSrCaCuO cuprates and 10-3-8 family
of iron based superconductor. This indicates the enormous role of thermal
fluctuations in the dynamics of the vortex lattice of superhydrides, the
physics of which is similar to the physics of unconventional high-temperature
superconductors.

<h3>Method of Mechanical Exfoliation of Bismuth with Micro-Trench Structures</h3>

<br>
<br>
The discovery of graphene led to a burst in search for 2D materials
originating from layered atomic crystals coupled by van der Waals force. While
bulk bismuth crystals share this layered crystal structure, unlike other group
V members of the periodic table, its interlayer bonds are stronger such that
traditional mechanical cleavage and exfoliation techniques have shown to be
inefficient. In this work, we present a novel mechanical cleavage method for
exfoliating bismuth by utilizing the stress concentration effect induced by
micro-trench SiO2 structures. As a result, the exfoliated bismuth flakes can
achieve thicknesses down to the sub-10 nm range which are analyzed by AFM and
Raman spectroscopy.

<h3>Engineering Photon-mediated Long-Range Spin Interactions in Mott  Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01339</a>
<br>
<i>Paul Fadler, Jiajun Li, Kai Phillip Schmidt, Martin Eckstein</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the potential to induce long-range spin interactions in a Mott
insulator via the quantum electromagnetic field of a cavity. The coupling
between light and spins is inherently non-linear, and occurs via multi-photon
processes like Raman scattering and two-photon absorption/emission with
electronically excited intermediate states. Based on this, two pathways are
elucidated: (i) In the absence of external driving, long-range interactions are
mediated by the exchange of at least two virtual cavity photons. We show that
these vacuum-mediated interactions can surpass local Heisenberg interactions in
mesoscopic setups such as sufficiently small split-ring resonators. (ii) In a
laser-driven cavity, interactions can be tailored through a hybrid scheme
involving both external laser photons and cavity photons. This offers a
versatile pathway for Floquet engineering of long-range interactions in
macroscopic systems. In general, the derivation of these interactions requires
careful consideration: Notably, we demonstrate that a simple phenomenological
approach, based on a spin-photon Hamiltonian that captures Raman and two-photon
processes with effective matrix elements, can be used only if the cavity is
resonantly driven. Outside of these narrow resonant regimes as well as for the
undriven case, a fourth-order series expansion within the underlying electronic
model is necessary, which we perform to obtain long-range four-spin
interactions in the half-filled Hubbard model.

<h3>The Universal Statistical Structure and Scaling Laws of Chaos and  Turbulence</h3>

<br>
<br>
Turbulence is a complex spatial and temporal structure created by the strong
non-linear dynamics of fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. Despite being an
ubiquitous phenomenon that has been studied for centuries, a full understanding
of turbulence remained a formidable challenge. Here, we introduce tools from
the fields of quantum chaos and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and present a
detailed analysis of image datasets generated from turbulence simulations of
incompressible and compressible fluid flows. Focusing on two observables: the
data Gram matrix and the single image distribution, we study both the local and
global eigenvalue statistics and compare them to classical chaos, uncorrelated
noise and natural images. We show that from the RMT perspective, the turbulence
Gram matrices lie in the same universality class as quantum chaotic rather than
integrable systems, and the data exhibits power-law scalings in the bulk of its
eigenvalues which are vastly different from uncorrelated classical chaos,
random data, natural images. Interestingly, we find that the single sample
distribution only appears as fully RMT chaotic, but deviates from chaos at
larger correlation lengths, as well as exhibiting different scaling properties.

<h3>Economical routes to size-specific assembly of self-closing structures</h3>

<br>
<br>
The push to harness self-assembly to create complex and functional nanoscale
materials has led to the development of a large class of synthetic crystals.
However, many applications require `self-limiting' assembly, which autonomously
terminates at a well-defined size and geometry. For example, structures such as
tubules, vesicles, or capsids can be designed to self-close at a particular
size, symmetry, and Gaussian curvature. But developing synthetic strategies for
self-limiting assembly has been challenging, in part because such structures
are prone to polymorphism that arises from thermal fluctuations of their local
curvature. Here, we introduce a strategy to eliminate polymorphism by
increasing the assembly complexity. We make triangular subunits using DNA
origami that have specific, valence-limited interactions and designed
curvature, and study their assembly into tubules with targeted width and
helicity. By assembling structures with as many as 16 distinct subunit types,
we demonstrate that our approach enables assembly with arbitrarily high
complexity. In the limit of single-subunit assembly, we find that thermal
fluctuations allow the system to access nearby, off-target states with varying
widths and helicities. By increasing the number of distinct components, we
reduce the density of off-target states, increasing the selectivity of a
user-specified target structure to nearly 100%. We further show that by
reducing the design constraints by targeting either the pitch or the width of
tubules, fewer subunits are needed to reach complete selectivity. Combining
experiments with theory, our results reveal an economical limit, which
determines the minimum number of subunit species that are required to create
arbitrary assembly sizes with full selectivity. In the future, this approach
could be extended to more complex self-limited structures, such as shells or
triply periodic surfaces.

<h3>Millimeter-scale exfoliation of hBN with tunable flake thickness</h3>

<br>
As a two-dimensional (2D) dielectric material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
is in high demand for applications in photonics, nonlinear optics, and
nanoelectronics. Unfortunately, the high-throughput preparation of
macroscopic-scale, high-quality hBN flakes with controlled thickness is an
ongoing challenge, limiting device fabrication and technological integration.
Here, we present a metal thin-film exfoliation method to prepare hBN flakes
with millimeter-scale dimension, near-unity yields, and tunable flake thickness
distribution from 1-7 layers, a substantial improvement over scotch tape
exfoliation. The single crystallinity and high quality of the exfoliated hBN
are demonstrated with optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation. We further explore a possible
mechanism for the effectiveness and selectivity based on thin-film residual
stress measurements, density functional theory calculations, and transmission
electron microscopy imaging of the deposited metal films. We find that the
magnitude of the residual tensile stress induced by thin film deposition plays
a key role in determining exfoliated flake thickness in a manner which closely
resembles 3D semiconductor spalling. Lastly, we demonstrate that our
exfoliated, large-area hBN flakes can be readily incorporated as encapsulating
layers for other 2D monolayers. Altogether, this method brings us one step
closer to the high throughput, mass production of hBN-based 2D photonic,
optoelectronic, and quantum devices.

Quantum fields in regions of extreme spacetime curvature give rise to a
wealth of effects, like Hawking radiation at the horizon of black holes. While
quantum field theory can only be studied theoretically in black holes, it can
be tested in controlled laboratory experiments. Typically, a fluid accelerating
from sub- to supersonic speed will create an effectively curved spacetime for
the acoustic field, with an apparent horizon where the speed of the fluid
equals the speed of sound. Here we create effective curved spacetimes with a
quantum fluid of light, with smooth and steep acoustic horizons and various
supersonic fluid speeds. We use a recently developed spectroscopy method to
measure the spectrum of acoustic excitations on these spacetimes, thus
observing negative energy modes in the supersonic regions. This demonstrates
the potential of quantum fluids of light for the study of field theories on
curved spacetimes.

<br>
<br>
Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are excited by femtosecond extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) transient gratings (TGs) in a room-temperature ferrimagnetic DyCo$_5$
alloy. TGs are generated by crossing a pair of EUV pulses from a free electron
laser (FEL) with the wavelength of 20.8\,nm matching the Co $M$-edge, resulting
in a SAW wavelength of $\Lambda=44$\,nm. Using the pump-probe transient grating
scheme in a reflection geometry the excited SAWs could be followed in the time
range of -10 to 100\,ps in the thin film. Coherent generation of TGs by
ultrafast EUV pulses allows to excite SAW in any material and to investigate
their couplings to other dynamics such as spin waves and orbital dynamics.

We consider the isochrone curves in first-passage percolation on a 2D square
lattice, i.e. the boundary of the set of points which can be reached in less
than a given time from a certain origin. The occurrence of an instantaneous
average shape is described in terms of its Fourier components, highlighting a
crossover between a diamond and a circular geometry as the noise level is
increased. Generally, these isochrones can be understood as fluctuating
interfaces with an inhomogeneous local width which reveals the underlying
lattice structure. We show that once these inhomogeneities have been taken into
account, the fluctuations fall into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality
class with very good accuracy, where they reproduce the Family-Vicsek Ansatz
with the expected exponents and the Tracy-Widom histogram for the local radial
fluctuations.

Discovering new materials that efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction and
evolution reactions is critical for facilitating the widespread adoption of
solid oxide fuel cell and electrolyzer (SOFC/SOEC) technologies. Here, we
develop machine learning (ML) models to predict perovskite catalytic properties
critical for SOFC/SOEC applications, including oxygen surface exchange, oxygen
diffusivity, and area specific resistance (ASR). The models are based on
trivial-to-calculate elemental features and are more accurate and dramatically
faster than the best models based on ab initio-derived features, potentially
eliminating the need for ab initio calculations in descriptor-based screening.
Our model of ASR enables temperature-dependent predictions, has well calibrated
uncertainty estimates and online accessibility. Use of temporal
cross-validation reveals our model to be effective at discovering new promising
materials prior to their initial discovery, demonstrating our model can make
meaningful predictions. Using the SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP)
approach, we provide detailed discussion of different approaches of model
featurization for ML property prediction. Finally, we use our model to screen
more than 19 million perovskites to develop a list of promising cheap,
earth-abundant, stable, and high performing materials, and find some top
materials contain mixtures of less-explored elements (e.g., K, Bi, Y, Ni, Cu)
worth exploring in more detail.

<br>
<br>
The flow of elliptical particles out of a 2-dimensional silo when extracted
with a conveyor belt is analyzed experimentally. The conveyor belt - placed
directly below the silo outlet - reduces the flow rate, increases the size of
the stagnant zone, and it has a very strong influence on the relative velocity
fluctuations as they strongly increase everywhere in the silo with decreasing
belt speed. In other words, instead of slower but smooth flow, flow reduction
by belt leads to intermittent flow. Interestingly, we show that this
intermittency correlates with a strong reduction of the orientational order of
the particles at the orifice region. Moreover, we observe that the average
orientation of the grains passing through the outlet is modified when they are
extracted with the belt, a feature that becomes more evident for large
orifices.

<br>
<br>
The essential building blocks of cuprate superconductors are two-dimensional
CuO$_2$ sheets interspersed with charge reservoir layers. In bilayer cuprates,
two closely spaced CuO$_2$ sheets are separated by a larger distance from the
subsequent pair in the next unit cell. In contrast to single-layer cuprates,
prior theoretical work on bilayer systems has predicted two distinct acoustic
plasmon bands for a given out-of-plane momentum transfer. Here we report random
phase approximation (RPA) calculations for bilayer systems which corroborate
the existence of two distinct plasmons bands. We find that the intensity of the
lower-energy band is negligibly small, whereas the higher-energy band carries
significant spectral weight. We also present resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering (RIXS) experiments at the O $K$-edge on the bilayer cuprate
Y$_{0.85}$Ca$_{0.15}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (Ca-YBCO), which show only one
dispersive plasmon branch, in agreement with the RPA calculations. In addition,
the RPA results indicate that the dispersion of the higher-energy plasmon band
in Ca-YBCO is not strictly acoustic, but exhibits a substantial energy gap of
approximately 250 meV at the two-dimensional Brillouin zone center.

Metal nanoclusters supported on oxide surfaces are widely-used catalysts that
boasts sharply enhanced activity over their bulk, especially for the coinage
metals: Au, Ag and Cu. These properties depend sensitively on the nanocluster
structure, which are challenging to model with density functional theory (DFT)
-- the workhorse modelling technique. Leveraging the recently developed SKZCAM
protocol, we perform the first ever benchmark study of coinage metal structures
on the MgO surface with coupled cluster theory [CCSD(T)] -- the gold-standard
modelling technique. We investigate a comprehensive range of DFT models
(exchange-correlation functional and dispersion correction) and our benchmarks
reveal that none of the investigated models can accurately describe this
system. We demonstrate that this arises from inadequate account of metal-metal
interactions in the nanocluster and propose a high-level correction which
provides reference accuracy at low cost. This forges a path towards studying
larger systems, which we highlight by benchmarking Au$_{20}$ on MgO, a
challenging system where DFT models have disagreed on its ground state
structure.
