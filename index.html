<h3>Optical tweezer generation using automated alignment and adaptive optics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00860</a>
<br>
<i>Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana, Karatzyna Krzyzanowska, Malcolm Boshier</i>
<p>Recent progress in quantum technologies with ultracold atoms has been
propelled by spatially fine-tuned control of lasers and diffraction-limited
imaging. The state-of-the-art precision of optical alignment to achieve this
fine-tuning is reaching the limits of manual control. Here, we show how to
automate this process. One of the elementary techniques of manual alignment of
optics is cross-walking of laser beams. Here, we generalize this technique to
multi-variable cross-walking. Mathematically, this is a variant of the
well-known Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm in convex optimization and
is closely related to the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Therefore, we refer to our
multi-variable cross-walking algorithm as the modified AM algorithm. While
cross-walking more than two variables manually is challenging, one can do this
easily for machine-controlled variables. We apply this algorithm to
mechanically align high numerical aperture (NA) objectives and show that we can
produce high-quality diffraction-limited tweezers and point spread functions
(PSF). After a rudimentary coarse alignment, the algorithm takes about 1 hour
to align the optics to produce high-quality tweezers. Moreover, we use the same
algorithm to optimize the shape of a deformable mirror along with the
mechanical variables and show that it can be used to correct for optical
aberrations produced, for example, by glass thickness when producing tweezers
and imaging point sources. The shape of the deformable mirror is parametrized
using the first 14 non-trivial Zernike polynomials, and the corresponding
coefficients are optimized together with the mechanical alignment variables. We
show PSF with a Strehl ratio close to 1 and tweezers with a Strehl ratio >0.8.
The algorithm demonstrates exceptional robustness, effectively operating in the
presence of significant mechanical fluctuations induced by a noisy environment.

<h3>Prediction of Magnetic State of UO2 within Hubbard-corrected  Density-Functional Theory: A self-consistent approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00864" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00864</a>
<br>
<i>Mahmoud Payami</i>
<p>The magnetic state of UO$_2$ was determined experimentally to be
anti-ferromagnetic. Starting from this experimental fact, researchers have
calculated other properties within the Hubbard-corrected density-functional
theory, DFT+U. Up to now, the Hubbard parameters for UO$_2$ were usually so
chosen that the calculations give good results for some experimental data.
Also, to our knowledge there exists no valid theoretical research report on the
energetically stable magnetic state of this system. In present work, employing
the new method which is based on density-functional perturbation theory, we
have determined self-consistently the Hubbard parameters and ground-state
energies for UO$_2$ crystal in both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic
configurations, and the calculated results show that UO$_2$ crystal
energetically favors an anti-ferromagnetic state with a small energy
difference. In all the calculations the PBE-sol approximation was used for the
exchange-correlation energy functional.

<h3>Thermal effects in an imbalanced dipolar fermionic superfluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00874" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00874</a>
<br>
<i>Subhanka Mal, Hiranmaya Mishra, Prasanta K. Panigrahi, Bimalendu Deb</i>
<p>We investigate the temperature effects in an imbalanced superfluid atomic
Fermi gas. We consider a bilayer system of two-component dipolar fermionic
atoms with one layer containing atoms of one component and the other layer the
atoms of other component with an imbalance between the populations of the two
components. This imbalance results in uniform and nonuniform superfluid phases
such as phase-separated BCS, Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO), Sarma and
normal Fermi liquid phases for different system parameters. Using the
mean-field BCS theory together with the superfluid mass-density criterion we
classify different phases in thermodynamic phase diagram. Our results indicate
that for a dipolar Fermi system the Sarma phase is stable for large imbalance
at finite temperature below the critical temperature, and the FFLO phase is
stable for intermediate imbalance on the BCS side of a BCS-BCE crossover. The
phase diagram in the temperature and population imbalance plane indicate three
Lifshitz points: one corresponding to coexistance of BCS, FFLO and normal Fermi
liquid phase while the other two correspond to the coexistance of the Sarma
phase, FFLO phase and normal Fermi phase for dipolar interactions.

<h3>On the area swept by a biased diffusion till its first-exit time:  Martingale approach and gambling opportunities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00895</a>
<br>
<i>Yonathan Sarmiento, Debraj Das, Édgar Roldán</i>
<p>Using martingale theory, we compute, in very few lines, exact analytical
expressions for various first-exit-time statistics associated with
one-dimensional biased diffusion. Examples include the distribution for the
first-exit time from an interval, moments for the first-exit site, and
functionals of the position, which involve memory and time integration. As a
key example, we compute analytically the mean area swept by a biased diffusion
until it escapes an interval that may be asymmetric and have arbitrary length.
The mean area allows us to derive the hitherto unexplored cross-correlation
function between the first-exit time and the first-exit site, which vanishes
only for exit problems from symmetric intervals. As a colophon, we explore
connections of our results with gambling, showing that betting on the
time-integrated value of a losing game it is possible to design a strategy that
leads to a net average win.

<h3>Precision-controlled ultrafast electron microscope platforms. A case  study: Multiple-order coherent phonon dynamics in 1T-TaSe$_2$ probed at 50  femtosecond - 10 femtometer scales</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00915</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoyi Sun, Joseph William, Sachin Sharma, Shriraj Kunjir, Dan Morris, Shen Zhao, Chong-Yu Ruan</i>
<p>We report on the first detailed beam test attesting the fundamental principle
behind the development of high-current-efficiency ultrafast electron microscope
systems where a radio-frequency cavity is incorporated as a condenser lens in
the beam delivery system. To allow the experiment to be carried out with a
sufficient resolution to probe the performance at the emittance floor, a new
cascade loop RF controller system is developed to reduce the RF noise floor.
Temporal resolution at 50 femtoseconds in full-width-at-half-maximum and
detection sensitivity better than 1% are demonstrated on exfoliated 1T-TaSe$_2$
layers where the multi-order edge-mode coherent phonon excitation is employed
as the standard candle to benchmark the performance. The high temporal
resolution and the significant visibility to very low dynamical contrast in
diffraction signals give strong support to the working principle of the
high-brightness beam delivery via phase-space manipulation in the electron
microscope system.

<h3>Interference of Two-Dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensates in  Micro-Gravity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00920" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00920</a>
<br>
<i>Tie-Fu Zhang, Hao Zhu, Wen-Kai Bai, Kai Liu, Yi-Hui Xing, Wu-Ming Liu</i>
<p>We investigate the interference of two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates
in micro-gravity, which influenced by the interaction strength, initial
momentum, gravitational potential and phase difference. We demonstrate that the
gravitational potential from the Earth can change the density distribution and
phase distribution of the condensate's wave function. As time evolves, a
portion of the gravitational potential energy of the microscopic particles can
be converted into kinetic energy, which changes the motion of the microscopic
particles, and leads to the varying of the density and phase distribution of
the wave function. Nevertheless, the influences of the Earth's gravity on the
wave function can be eliminated by the micro-gravity environment, which
confirmed by many micro-gravity cold atom experiments. Our results present the
influences of gravity and other parameters on interference of Bose-Einstein
condensates, which help us to reveal the intrinsic natures of the related
theoretical predictions and experimental phenomena. Furthermore, our work
builds a bridge between the related physical phenomena and our physical
intuition about the Bose-Einstein condensates in micro-gravity environment.

<h3>Hot electrons and electromagnetic effects in the broadband Au, Ag, and  Ag-Au nanocrystals: The UV, visible, and NIR plasmons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00944" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00944</a>
<br>
<i>Alina Muravitskaya, Artur Movsesyan, Oscar Avalos-Ovando, Veronica A. Bahamondes Lorca, Miguel A. Correa-Duarte, Lucas V. Besteiro, Tim Liedl, Peng Yu, Zhiming Wang, Gil Markovich, Alexander O. Govorov</i>
<p>Energetic and optical properties of plasmonic nanocrystals strongly depend on
their sizes, shapes, and composition. Whereas using plasmonic nanoparticles in
biotesting has become routine, applications of plasmonics in energy are still
early in development. Here, we investigate hot electron (HE) generation and
related electromagnetic effects in both mono- and bi-metallic nanorods (NRs)
and focus on one promising type of bi-metallic nanocrystals - core-shell Au-Ag
nanorods. The spectra of the NRs are broadband, highly tunable with their
geometry, and have few plasmon resonances. In this work, we provide a new
quantum formalism describing the HE generation in bi-metallic nanostructures.
Interestingly, we observe that the HE generation rate at the UV plasmon
resonance of Au-Ag NRs appears to be very high. These HEs are highly energetic
and suitable for carbon-fuel reactions. Simultaneously, the HE generation at
the longitudinal plasmon (L-plasmon) peaks, which can be tuned from the yellow
to near-IR, depends on the near-field and electromagnetic Mie effects, limiting
the HE efficiencies for the long and large NRs. These properties of the
L-plasmon relate to all kinds of NRs (Au, Ag, and Au-Ag). We also consider the
generation of the interband d-holes in Au and Ag, since the involvement of the
d-band is crucial for the energetic properties of UV plasmons. The proposed
formalism is an important development for the description of bi-metallic (or
tri-metallic, or more complex) nanostructures, and it paves the way to the
efficient application of the plasmonic HEs and hot holes in sensing,
nanotechnology, photocatalysis, and electrophotochemistry.

<h3>Approaching the forbidden phase transition in the Ising model, III:  Hidden frustration, continuous marginal phase transition, and the minimal  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00948</a>
<br>
<i>Weiguo Yin</i>
<p>The laws that govern the nature often set certain limits or bans. Approaching
those limits is a common paradigm of breakthroughs in human knowledge and
technological application, such as time slowing to a stop as one approaches the
speed of light, electrons flowing freely with no resistance as one approaches
the absolute zero, and an event horizon arising as one approaches a black hole.
A well-known ban concerning the statistical mechanics of cooperative phenomena,
such as ice melting into water, is the nonexistence of phase transition at
finite temperature in the Ising model with short-range interactions in one
dimension. Yet, little is known about whether this forbidden transition could
be approached arbitrarily closely at fixed finite temperature. To explore such
asymptoticity, the notion of marginal phase transition (MPT) was introduced
recently, and both the spontaneous MPT and the field-induced MPT were
discovered respectively in ladder and single-chain Ising models decorated with
geometric frustration. Here I push the limit down to the minimal single-chain
Ising model -- without geometric frustration -- in a magnetic field; then, a
hidden frustration is revealed to drive the first-order MPT with large latent
heat. Furthermore, as one approaches the zero field, MPT appears continuous
with no latent heat, displays abrupt change in sublattice magnetization and a
kink-like minimum in overall magnetization with temperature, and vanishes when
the field drops below a threshold. These findings deepen our understanding of
cooperative phenomena via the doubly forbidden and open new avenues to the
design and engineering of the Ising systems with the different types of MPT for
exploring exotic phenomena and low-dimensional device applications.

<h3>Possible Meissner effect near room temperature in copper-substituted  lead apatite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00999" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00999</a>
<br>
<i>Hongyang Wang, Yao Yao, Ke Shi, Yijing Zhao, Hao Wu, Zhixing Wu, Zhihui Geng, Shufeng Ye, Ning Chen</i>
<p>With copper-substituted lead apatite below room temperature, we observe
diamagnetic dc magnetization under magnetic field of 25 Oe with remarkable
bifurcation between zero-field-cooling and field-cooling measurements, and
under 200 Oe it changes to be paramagnetism. A glassy memory effect is found
during cooling. Typical hysteresis loops for superconductors are detected below
250 K, along with an asymmetry between forward and backward sweep of magnetic
field. Our experiment suggests at room temperature the Meissner effect is
possibly present in this material.

<h3>Quantum phase transitions in the alternating XY chain with three-site  interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01031" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01031</a>
<br>
<i>Kaiyuan Cao, Hao Fu, Xue Liu, Ming Zhong, Peiqing Tong</i>
<p>We investigate the quantum phase transition in the alternating XY chain with
the XZY+YZX type of three-spin interactions. We present the exact solution
derived by means of the Jordan-Wigner transformation and study the average
magnetization, spin correlations, and von Neumann entropy to establish the
phase diagram. By examining the nearest-neighbor transverse spin correlation,
we probe that in the phase with zero magnetization (ZM), the spins within a
supercell tend to point to opposite directions of the external field, but
between the nearest-neighbor supercells are distributed randomly. This is the
reason for the magnetization vanishing in the ZM phase under the alternating
hopping interaction. In addition, we also investigate the influence of the
three-site interaction, and find that the ZM phase is absent as the strength of
the three-site interaction increases. Our findings shed light on the complex
behavior of the alternating XY chain and provide valuable insights for future
studies.

<h3>Braiding and fusion of Majorana fermions in minimal Kitaev spin liquid  on a single hexagon with $5$ qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01051</a>
<br>
<i>Motohiko Ezawa</i>
<p>We investigate the minimal Kitaev spin liquid on a single hexagon with three
Ising-type exchange interactions proportional to $K_{x}$, $K_{y}$ and $K_{z}$.
In the limit $K_{z}=0$, we find 32-fold zero-energy states, leading to 10 free
Majorana fermions, and hence, 5 qubits are constructed. These qubits are
protected by particle-hole symmetry even for $K_{z}\neq 0$. Braiding of these
Majorana fermions is possible by temporally controlling a spin-correlation
Hamiltonian. In addition, the fusion is possible by measuring the spin
correlation. By switching on the Heisenberg interaction together with magnetic
field, only one zero-energy state persists, which can be used as an
initialization of qubits. Furthermore, it is shown that $3L+2$ qubits are
constructed on the Kitaev spin liquid model on connected $L$ hexagons. All the
processes of initialization, operation and readout of qubits are executable in
terms of spin operators.

<h3>Electron transfer channel in the sugar recognition system assembled on  nano gold particle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01087" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01087</a>
<br>
<i>Takayuki Goto, Takeshi Hashimoto, Kai Sato, Yukihiro Kitamoto, Takashi Hayashita, Satoshi Iguchi, Takahiko Sasaki, Dita Puspita Sari, Isao Watanabe</i>
<p>Existence of 1D spin diffusion in the electrochemical sugar recognition
system consisting of a nano-sized gold particle (GNP), a ruthenium complex and
a phenylboronic acid was investigated by NMR and muSR. When sugar molecules are
recognized by the phenylboronic site, the response of electrochemical
voltammetry of the Ru site changes, enabling the system to work as a sensitive
sugar-sensor. In this recognition process, the change in the electronic state
at the boron site caused by sugar must be transferred to the Ru site via alkyl
chains. We have utilized the muon-labelled electrons method and the proton NMR
to find out a channel of the electron transfer from the phenylboronic acid site
to the gold nano particle via the one dimensional alkyl chain. If this transfer
is driven by diffusive spin channel, characteristic field dependence is
expected in the longitudinal spin relaxation rate of muSR and 1H-NMR. We have
observed significant decrease in the spin relaxation rates with increasing
applied field. The result is discussed in terms of low dimensional spin
diffusion.

<h3>Efficient Magnon Injection and Detection via the Orbital Rashba  Edelstein Effect</h3>

<i>J.A. Mendoza-Rodarte, M. Cosset-Chéneau, B.J. van Wees, M.H.D. Guimarães</i>
<p>Orbital currents and accumulation provide a new avenue to boost spintronic
effects in nanodevices. Here we use interconversion effects between charge
current and orbital angular momentum to demonstrate a dramatic increase in the
magnon spin injection and detection efficiencies in nanodevices consisting of a
magnetic insulator contacted by Pt/CuOx electrodes. Moreover, we note distinct
variations in efficiency for magnon spin injection and detection, indicating a
disparity in the direct and inverse orbital Rashba Edelstein effect
efficiencies.

<h3>RKKY signals characterizing the topological phase transitions in Floquet  Dirac semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01111" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01111</a>
<br>
<i>Hou-Jian Duan, Shi-Ming Cai, Xing Wei, Yong-Chi Chen, Yong-Jia Wu, Ming-Xun Deng, Ruiqiang Wang, Mou Yang</i>
<p>Recently, the Floquet ${\rm Na_3Bi}$-type material has been proposed as an
ideal platform for realizing various phases, i.e., the spin-degenerate Dirac
semimetal (DSM) can be turned into the Weyl semimetal (WSM), and even to the
Weyl half-metal (WHM). Instead of the conventional electrical methods, we use
the RKKY interaction to characterize the topological phase transitions in this
paper. It is found that detecting the Ising term $J_I$ is feasible for
distinguishing the phase transition of DSM/WSM, since the emergence of $J_I$ is
induced by the broken spin degeneracy. For the case with impurities deposited
on $z$ axis (the line connecting the Weyl points), the Heisenberg term $J_H$
coexists with $J_I$ in the WSM, while $J_H$ is filtered out and only $J_I$
survives in the WHM. This magnetic filtering effect is a reflection of the
fully spin-polarized property (one spin band is in the WSM phase while the
other is gapped) of the WHM, and it can act a signal to capture the phase
transition of WSM/WHM. This signal can not be disturbed unless the direction of
the impurities greatly deviates from $z$ axis. Interestingly, as the impurities
are moved into the $x$-$y$ plane, there arises another signal (a dip structure
for $J_H$ at the phase boundary), which can also identify the phase transition
of WSM/WHM. Furthermore, we have verified that all magnetic signals are robust
to the term that breaks the electron-hole symmetry. Besides characterizing the
phase transitions, our results also suggest that the Floquet DSMs are power
platforms for controlling the magnetic interaction.

<p>The physics of driven collective modes in quantum materials underpin a number
of striking non-equilibrium functional responses, which include enhanced
magnetism, ferroelectricity and superconductivity. However, the coherent
coupling between multiple modes at once are difficult to capture by single-pump
probe (one-dimensional) spectroscopy, and often remain poorly understood. One
example is phonon-mediated amplification of Josephson plasmons in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, in which at least three normal modes of the solid are
coherently mixed as a source of enhanced superconductivity. Here, we go beyond
previous pump-probe experiments in this system and acquire two-dimensional
frequency maps using pairs of mutually delayed, carrier envelope phase stable
mid-infrared pump pulses, combined with measurements of the time-modulated
second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility. We find that the driven
zone-center phonons amplify coherent pairs of opposite-momentum Josephson
plasma polaritons, generating a squeezed state of interlayer phase
fluctuations. The squeezed state is a potentially important ingredient in the
microscopic physics of photo-induced superconductivity in this and other
materials.

<h3>First-passage time of a Brownian searcher with stochastic resetting to  random positions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01125" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01125</a>
<br>
<i>Vicenç Mendez, Rosa Flaquer-Galmés, Daniel Campos</i>
<p>We study the effect of a resetting point randomly distributed around the
origin on the mean first passage time of a Brownian searcher moving in one
dimension. We compare the search efficiency with that corresponding to reset to
the origin and find that the mean first passage time of the latter can be
larger or smaller than the distributed case, depending on whether the resetting
points are symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed. In particular, we prove
the existence of an optimal reset rate that minimizes the mean first-passage
time for distributed resetting to a finite interval if the target is located
outside this interval. When the target position belongs to the resetting
interval or it is infinite then no optimal reset rate exists, but there is an
optimal resetting interval width or resetting characteristic scale which
minimizes the mean first-passage time. We also show that the first-passage
density averaged over the resetting points depends on its first moment only. As
a consequence, there is an equivalent point such that the first-passage problem
with resetting to that point is statistically equivalent to the case of
distributed resetting. We end our study by analyzing the fluctuations of the
first-passage times for these cases. All our analytical results are verified
through numerical simulations.

<h3>Thermodynamic modeling using Extended UNIQUAC and COSMO-RS-ES models:  Case study of the cesium nitrate - water system over a large range of  temperatures</h3>

<p>A comparison of two thermodynamic models is presented using the water-cesium
nitrate system as case study. Both models were able to model the thermodynamic
properties such as the osmotic coefficient, vapor pressure, mean activity
coefficient and solubility with good accuracy. We show that it is possible to
reproduce the temperature dependency of the properties using a simple set of
parameters in the case of Extended UNIQUAC. Furthermore, COSMO-RS-ES is a
completely predictive model adjusted to data at 298.15 K, which is applied for
the first time to other temperatures.

<br>
<i>Setareh Medghalchi, Joscha Kortmann, Sang-Hyeok Lee, Ehsan Karimi, Ulrich Kerzel, Sandra Korte-Kerzel</i>
<p>Many properties of commonly used materials are driven by their
microstructure, which can be influenced by the composition and manufacturing
processes. To optimise future materials, understanding the microstructure is
critically important. Here, we present two novel approaches based on artificial
intelligence that allow the segmentation of the phases of a microstructure for
which simple numerical approaches, such as thresholding, are not applicable:
One is based on the nnU-Net neural network, and the other on generative
adversarial networks (GAN). Using large panoramic scanning electron microscopy
images of dual-phase steels as a case study, we demonstrate how both methods
effectively segment intricate microstructural details, including martensite,
ferrite, and damage sites, for subsequent analysis. Either method shows
substantial generalizability across a range of image sizes and conditions,
including heat-treated microstructures with different phase configurations. The
nnU-Net excels in mapping large image areas. Conversely, the GAN-based method
performs reliably on smaller images, providing greater step-by-step control and
flexibility over the segmentation process. This study highlights the benefits
of segmented microstructural data for various purposes, such as calculating
phase fractions, modelling material behaviour through finite element
simulation, and conducting geometrical analyses of damage sites and the local
properties of their surrounding microstructure.

<h3>Variational bounds and nonlinear stability of an active nematic  suspension</h3>

<i>Scott Weady</i>
<p>We use the entropy method to analyze the nonlinear dynamics and stability of
a continuum kinetic model of an active nematic suspension. From the time
evolution of the relative entropy -- an energy-like quantity in the kinetic
model -- we derive a variational bound on relative entropy fluctuations that
can be expressed in terms of orientational order parameters. From this bound we
show isotropic suspensions are nonlinearly stable for sufficiently low
activity, and derive upper bounds on spatiotemporal averages in the unstable
regime that are consistent with fully nonlinear simulations. This work
highlights the self-organizing role of activity in particle suspensions, and
places limits on how organized such systems can be.

<h3>Origin of zigzag antiferromagnetic orders in XPS3 (X= Fe, Ni) monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01203" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01203</a>
<br>
<i>Ping Li, Xueyang Li, Junsheng Feng, Jinyang Ni, Zhi-Xin Guo, Hongjun Xiang</i>
<p>Recently, two monolayer magnetic materials, i.e., FePS3 and NiPS3, have been
successfully fabricated. Despite that they have the same atomic structure, the
two monolayers exhibit distinct magnetic properties. FePS3 holds an
out-of-plane zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM-ZZ) structure, while NiPS3 exhibits
an in-plane AFM-ZZ structure. However, there is no theoretical model which can
properly describe its magnetic ground state due to the lack of a full
understanding of its magnetic interactions. Here, by combining the
first-principles calculations and the newly developed machine learning method,
we construct an exact spin Hamiltonian of the two magnetic materials. Different
from the previous studies which failed to fully consider the spin-orbit
coupling effect, we find that the AFM-ZZ ground state in FePS3 is stabilized by
competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third
nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, and combining single-ion anisotropy.
Whereas, the often ignored nearest-neighbor biquadratic exchange is responsible
for the in-plane AFM-ZZ ground state in NiPS3. We additionally calculate
spin-wave spectrum of AFM-ZZ structure in the two monolayers based on the exact
spin Hamiltonian, which can be directly verified by the experimental
investigation. Our work provides a theoretical framework for the origin of
AFM-ZZ ground state in two-dimensional materials.

<p>Rattling phonon modes are known to be origin of various anomalous physical
properties such as superconductivity, suppression of thermal conductivity,
enhancement of specific heat etc. By means of DFT+$U$ calculations we directly
show presence of the rattling mode in the quadruple perovskites
CuCu$_3$V$_4$O$_{12}$ and CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ and argue that this can
develop in others as well. It is demonstrated that Cu ions at $A$ sites vibrate
in the center of the icosahedral oxygen O$_{12}$ cages and the corresponding
potential has a complicated form with many local minima.

<i>Jingyu Yao, Haohao Sheng, Ruihan Zhang, Quansheng Wu, Hongming Weng, Xi Dai, Zhong Fang, Zhijun Wang</i>
<p>By systematic theoretical calculations, we have revealed an excitonic
insulator (EI) in a van der Waals layered compound $\rm{Ta_{2}Pd_{3}Te_5}$.
First-principles calculations show that the monolayer is a nearly zero-gap
semiconductor. Due to the like symmetry of the band-edge states, the 2D
polarization $\alpha_{2D}$ would be finite as the band gap goes to zero,
allowing for the EI state in the compound. Using the first-principles many-body
perturbation theory, the $GW$-BSE calculation shows that the exciton binding
energy $E_b$ is larger than the single-particle band gap $E_g$, indicating the
excitonic instability. Additionally, no structure instability is found in the
phonon spectrum of this material.

<h3>Twinning induced by elastic anisotropy in FCC crystals</h3>

<p>Dislocation slip and deformation twin are widely regarded as two important
mechanisms of active competition in the process of plastic deformation.
Calculating and comparing the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of two
deformation modes are the key to discussing the mechanical properties reflected
by different mechanisms in crystals. Here, the paper proposes a model to
predict the CRSS of discrete twins, resembling thin layers, using the elastic
anisotropy theory and a macroscopic energy perspective. In addition, the
directionality of deformation twinning is also verified. We investigated
twinning in FCC crystals to illustrate the methodology, and predicted the CRSS
of twinning under different variables such as temperature and strain rate, both
of which were in excellent agreement with experimental and other theory
results. It draws the conclusion that we can promote twinning nucleation by
applying shear stress along the <112> direction to reduce the interface energy
as a resistance term and increase the difference in strain energy for twinning
nucleation. This conclusion provides a guiding direction for exploring and
accurately predicting the conditions of twinning in FCC crystals in future.

<h3>Phase space maximal entropy random walk: Langevin-like ensemble of  physical trajectories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01239" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01239</a>
<br>
<i>Jarek Duda</i>
<p>As written by statistician George Box "All models are wrong, but some are
useful", standard diffusion derivation or Feynman path ensembles use
nonphysical nowhere differentiable trajectories of infinite kinetic energy -
what seems wrong, bringing question of differences if doing it more right this
article is focused on. To consider ensembles of more physical trajectories, we
can work in $(x,v)$ phase space like in Langevin equation with velocity
controlling spatial steps, here also controlled with spatial potential $V(x)$.
There will be discussed and compared 4 approaches to predict stationary
probability distributions: using Boltzmann ensemble of points in space (GRW -
generic random walk) or in phase space (psGRW), and analogously Boltzmann
ensemble of paths in space (MERW - maximal entropy random walk) and in phase
space (psMERW). They have qualitatively different predictions, hopefully
allowing to decide the most appropriate for various settings by distinguishing
them experimentally. Path ensembles have much stronger Anderson-like
localization exactly as in quantum ground state, proposed novel in phase space
has additionally increased density of velocity as in potential gradient,
decreased toward barrier. While MERW is thermodynamically in agreement with
quantum mechanics, psMERW suggests slight corrections from consideration of
more physical trajectories, which seem natural - reduced velocities toward
close barriers, increased down potential gradients.

<h3>Floquet topological phases with large winding number</h3>

<br>
<i>Kaiye Shi, Xiang Zhang, Wei Zhang</i>
<p>Recently, anomalous Floquet topological phases without static counterparts
have been observed in different systems, where periodically driven models are
realized to support a winding number of 1 and a pair of edge modes in each
quasienergy gap. Here, we focus on cold atomic gases in optical lattices and
propose a novel driving scheme that breaks rotation symmetry but maintains
inversion symmetry of the instantaneous Hamiltonian, and discover a novel type
of anomalous Floquet topological phase with winding number larger than 1. By
analyzing the condition of band touching under symmetry constraint, we map out
the phase diagram exactly by varying the driving parameters and discuss the
quasienergy spectra of typical topological phases, which can present multiple
pairs of edge modes within a single gap. Finally, we suggest to characterize
the topology of such phases by detecting the band inversion surfaces via quench
dynamics.

<h3>A DFT study of the structural and electronic properties of single and  double acceptor dopants in MX2 monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01251</a>
<br>
<i>Yuqiang Gao, Paul J. Kelly</i>
<p>Density functional theory calculations are used to systematically investigate
the structural and electronic properties of MX$_2$ transition metal
dichalcogenide monolayers with M = Cr, Mo, W and X = S, Se, Te that are doped
with single (V, Nb, Ta) and double (Ti, Zr, Hf) acceptor dopants on the M site
with local $D_{3h}$ symmetry in the dilute limit. Three impurity levels that
arise from intervalley scattering are found above the valence band maxima
(VBM): an orbitally doubly degenerate $e'$ level bound to the $K/K'$ VBM and a
singly degenerate $a'_1$ level bound to the $\Gamma$-point VBM. Replacing S
with Se or Te lowers the $\Gamma$ point VBM substantially with respect to the
$K/K'$ VBM bringing the $a'_1$ level down with it. The relative positions of
the impurity levels that determine the different structural and electronic
properties of the impurities in $p$-doped MX$_2$ monolayers can thus be tuned
by replacing S with Se or Te.
Single acceptors introduce a magnetic moment of 1$\, \mu_{\rm B}$ in all
MX$_2$ monolayers. Out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy energies as large as 10
meV/dopant atom are found thereby satisfying an essential condition for
long-range ferromagnetic ordering in two dimensions. For double acceptors in
MS$_2$ monolayers, both holes occupy the high-lying $a'_1$ level with opposite
spins so there is no magnetic moment; in MSe$_2$ and MTe$_2$ monolayers the
holes occupy the $e'$ level, a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion wins the competition
with exchange splitting resulting in the quenching of the magnetic moments.
Even when the JT distortion is disallowed, magnetic double acceptors have a
large in-plane magnetic anisotropy energy that is incompatible with long-range
magnetic ordering in two dimensions. ....

<h3>Modelling the mechanics of 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet using  numerical simulation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01266" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01266</a>
<br>
<i>Arpit Kumar Srivastava, Enric Pardo</i>
<p>High temperature REBCO superconducting tapes are very promising for
high-field magnets. Under high magnetic fields there are high
electro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large
screening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design
of these magnets is not straightforward. In addition, many contemporary designs
use insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional
axisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the
displacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a
large number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an an-isotropic bulk
hollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in
literature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following
configuration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and
we calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the
MEMEP model. As a case study, 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet, is taken and
simulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet
by including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike
previous work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused.
Effect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated
and compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field
strongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The
latter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations.
Additionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of
different material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly
reduces the mechanical stresses. The FE based model developed is efficient to
calculate the mechanical behaviour of any general superconductor magnet and its
devices.

<h3>Interaction dominated transport in 2D conductors: from degenerate to  partially-degenerate regime</h3>

<i>G. M. Gusev, A. D. Levin, E. B. Olshanetsky, Z. D. Kvon, V. M. Kovalev, M. V. Entin, N. N. Mikhailov</i>
<p>In this study, we investigate the conductivity of a two-dimensional (2D)
system in HgTe quantum well comprising two types of carriers with linear and
quadratic spectra, respectively. The interactions between the two-dimensional
Dirac holes and the heavy holes lead to the breakdown of Galilean invariance,
resulting in interaction-limited resistivity. Our exploration of the transport
properties spans from low temperatures, where both subsystems are fully
degenerate, to higher temperatures, where the Dirac holes remain degenerate
while the heavy holes follow Boltzmann statistics, creating a partially
degenerate regime. Through a developed theory, we successfully predict the
behavior of resistivity as $\rho\sim T^2$ and $\rho\sim T^{3}$ for the fully
degenerate and partially degenerate regimes, respectively, which is in
reasonable agreement with experimental observations. Notably, at elevated
temperatures, the interaction-limited resistivity surpasses the resistivity
caused by impurity scattering by a factor of 5-6. These findings imply that the
investigated system serves as a versatile experimental platform for exploring
various interaction-limited transport regimes in two component plasma.

<h3>An Out-of-Equilibrium 1D Particle System Undergoing Perfectly Plastic  Collisions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01279" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01279</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Fraiman</i>
<p>At time zero, there are $N$ identical point particles in the line (1D) which
are characterized by their positions and velocities. Both values are given
randomly and independently from each other, with arbitrary probability
densities. Each particle evolves at constant velocity until eventually they
meet. When this happens, a perfectly-plastic collision is produced, resulting
in a new particle composed by the sum of their masses and the weighted average
velocity.The merged particles evolve indistinguishably from the non-merged
ones, i.e. they move at constant velocity until a new plastic collision
eventually happens. As in any open system, the particles are not confined to
any region or reservoir, so as time progresses, they go on to infinity. From
this non-equilibrium process, the number of (now, non-identical) final
particles, $\tilde{X}_N$, the distribution of masses of these final particles
and the kinetic energy loss from all plastic collisions, is studied.
Counterintuitively, the way to achieve the number of final particles and each
of their masses does not need to rely on evolving the particle system; this
result can be obtained by simply considering the initial conditions. Moreover,
they can also be used to obtain an accurate approximation of the energy loss.
Finally, I will also present strong evidence for the validity of the following
conjecture: $\langle \tilde{X}_N \rangle=\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{1}{k}$ (which
behaves as $log(N)+\gamma$ for large $N$), additionally an explicit expression
for the variance will also be given.

<p>We use soft x-ray vector-ptychographic tomography to determine the
three-dimensional magnetization field in superparamagnetic nanoparticles
self-assembled at the liquid-liquid interface and reveal the magnetic order
induced by layered structure. The spins in individual nanoparticles become more
aligned with increasing number of layers, resulting in a larger net
magnetization. Our experimental results show a magnetic short-range order in
the monolayer due to the proliferation of thermally induced magnetic vortices
and a magnetic long-range order in the bilayer and trilayer, stemming from the
strengthened dipolar interactions that effectively suppress thermal
fluctuations. We also observe a screening effect of magnetic vortices and the
attractive interaction between the magnetic vortices with opposite topological
charges. Our work demonstrates the crucial role of layered structure in shaping
the magnetization of nanoparticle assemblies, providing new opportunities to
modulate these properties through strategic layer engineering.

<p>Strain engineering has quickly emerged as a viable option to modify the
electronic, optical and magnetic properties of 2D materials. However, it
remains challenging to arbitrarily control the strain. Here we show that by
creating atomically-flat surface nanostructures in hexagonal boron nitride, we
achieve an arbitrary on-chip control of both the strain distribution and
magnitude on high-quality molybdenum disulfide. The phonon and exciton
emissions are shown to vary in accordance with our strain field designs,
enabling us to write and draw any photoluminescence color image in a single
chip. Moreover, our strain engineering offers a powerful means to significantly
and controllably alter the strengths and energies of interlayer excitons at
room temperature. This method can be easily extended to other material systems
and offers a promise for functional excitonic devices.

<h3>Restart uncertainty relation for monitored quantum dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01307" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01307</a>
<br>
<i>Ruoyu Yin, Qingyuan Wang, Sabine Tornow, Eli Barkai</i>
<p>We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relationship within the context
of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the
concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum
computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies
have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken
to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the
sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances.
Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism
in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads
to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our
newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these
phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near
resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the
fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our
understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and
dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient
quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.

<h3>Hamiltonian Learning in Quantum Field Theories</h3>

<p>We discuss Hamiltonian learning in quantum field theories as a protocol for
systematically extracting the operator content and coupling constants of
effective field theory Hamiltonians from experimental data. Learning the
Hamiltonian for varying spatial measurement resolutions gives access to field
theories at different energy scales, and allows to learn a flow of Hamiltonians
reminiscent of the renormalization group. Our method, which we demonstrate in
both theoretical studies and available data from a quantum gas experiment,
promises new ways of addressing the emergence of quantum field theories in
quantum simulation experiments.

<h3>Emergence of unstable avoided crossing in the collective excitations of  spin-1 spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01310" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01310</a>
<br>
<i>Sanu Kumar Gangwar, Rajamanickam Ravisankar, Henrique Fabrelli, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj Kumar Mishra</i>
<p>We present the analytical and numerical results on the collective excitation
spectrum of quasi-one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensates. The collective excitation spectrum, using Bogoliubov-de-Gennes
theory, reveals the existence of a diverse range of phases in the SO and Rabi
($k_L-\Omega$) coupling plane. Based on eigenvalue of the excitation spectrum,
we categorize the $k_L-\Omega$ plane into three distinct regions. In region I,
a stable mode with phonon-like excitations is observed. In region IIa, single
and multi-band instabilities are noted with a gapped mode, while multi-band
instability accompanied by a gapless mode between low-lying and first excited
states is realized in region IIb, which also provides evidence of unstable
avoided crossing between low-lying and first excited modes The gap between
low-lying and first-excited states increases upon increasing the Rabi coupling
while decreases upon increase of SO coupling. Using eigenvector analysis, we
confirm the presence of the spin-dipole mode in the spin-like modes in Region
II. We corroborate the nature of the collective excitation through real-time
dynamical evolution of the ground state perturbed with the quench of the trap
using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii model. This analysis suggests the
presence of dynamical instability leading to the disappearance of the $0$-th
component of the condensate. In Region III, mainly encompassing $\Omega \sim 0$
and finite $k_L$, we observe phonon-like excitations in both the first excited
and the low-lying state. The eigenvectors in this region reveal alternative in-
and out-of-phase behaviours of the spin components. Numerical analysis reveals
the presence of a super stripe phase for small Rabi coupling in this region,
wherein the eigenvector indicates the presence of more complicated
spin-like-density mixed modes.
