<h3>Anisotropic acoustics in dipolar Fermi gases</h3>

We consider plane wave modes in ultracold, but not quantum degenerate,
dipolar Fermi gases in the hydrodynamic limit. Longitudinal waves present
anisotropies in both the speed of sound and their damping, and experience a
small, undulatory effect in their flow velocity. Two distinct types of shear
waves appear, a ``familiar" one, and another that is accompanied by nontrivial
density and temperature modulations. We propose these shear modes as an
experimental means to measure the viscosity coefficients, including their
anisotropies.

The dissipation function for a system is defined as the natural logarithm of
the ratio between probabilities of a trajectory and its time-reversed
trajectory, and its probability distribution follows a well-known relation
called the fluctuation theorem. Using the generic Langevin equations, we derive
the expressions of the dissipation function for passive and active systems. For
passive systems, the dissipation function depends only on the initial and the
final values of the dynamical variables of the system, not on the trajectory of
the system. Furthermore, it does not depend explicitly on the reactive or
dissipative coupling coefficients of the generic Langevin equations. In
addition, we study a 1D case numerically to verify the fluctuation theorem with
the form of the dissipation function we obtained. For active systems, we define
the work done by active forces along a trajectory. If the probability
distribution of the dynamical variables is symmetric under time reversal, in
both cases, the average rate of change of the dissipation function with
trajectory duration is nothing but the average entropy production rate of the
system and reservoir.

We present a simple 1-d stochastic model with two control parameters and a
surprisingly rich zoo of phase transitions. At each (discrete) site $x$ and
time $t$, there is an integer $n(x,t)$ that satisfies a linear interface
equation with added random noise. Depending on the control parameters, this
noise may or may not satisfy the detailed balance condition, so that the model
is -- for suitable initial conditions -- in the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) or in
the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In addition, there is also a
constraint $n(x,t) \geq 0$. Points $x$ where $n>0$ on one side and $n=0$ on the
other are called ``fronts". These fronts can be ``pushed" or ``pulled",
depending on the control parameters. For pulled fronts, the lateral spreading
is in the directed percolation (DP) universality class, while it is of a novel
type for pushed fronts, with yet another novel behavior in between. In the DP
case, the activity at each active site can in general be arbitrarily large, in
contrast to previous realizations of DP. Finally, we find two different types
of transitions when the interface detaches from the line $n=0$ (with $\langle
n(x,t)\rangle \to const$ on one side, and $\to \infty$ on the other), again
with new universality classes. We also discuss a mapping of this model to the
avalanche propagation in a directed Oslo rice pile model in specially prepared
backgrounds.

<h3>Emergent Spacetime in Quantum Lattice Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12548" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12548</a>

Many quantum lattice models have an emergent relativistic description in
their continuum limit. The celebrated example is graphene, whose continuum
limit is described by the Dirac equation on a Minkowski spacetime. Not only
does the continuum limit provide us with a dictionary of geometric observables
to describe the models with, but it also allows one to solve models that were
otherwise analytically intractable. In this thesis, we investigate novel
features of this relativistic description for a range of quantum lattice
models. In particular, we demonstrate how to generate emergent curved
spacetimes and identify observables at the lattice level which reveal this
emergent behaviour, allowing one to simulate relativistic effects in the
laboratory. We first study carbon nanotubes, a system with an edge, which
allows us to test the interesting feature of the Dirac equation that it allows
for bulk states with support on the edges of the system. We then study Kitaev's
honeycomb model which has a continuum limit describing Majorana spinors on a
Minkowski spacetime. We show how to generate a non-trivial metric in the
continuum limit of this model and how to observe the effects of this metric and
its corresponding curvature in the lattice observables, such as Majorana
correlators, Majorana zero modes and the spin densities. We also discuss how
lattice defects and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields at the lattice level can
generate chiral gauge fields in the continuum limit and we reveal their
adiabatic equivalence. Finally, we discuss a chiral modification of the 1D XY
model which makes the model interacting and introduces a non-trivial phase
diagram. We see that this generates a black hole metric in the continuum limit,
where the inside and outside of the black hole are in different phases. We then
demonstrate that by quenching this model we can simulate Hawking radiation.

<h3>Multilayer graphene with a superlattice potential</h3>

Bernal stacked bilayer graphene subject to a superlattice potential can
realize topological and stacked flat bands [1]. In the present work, we extend
the study of a superlattice potential on graphene heterostructures to trilayer
and quadrilayer graphene. Comparing Bernal- and chirally-stacked multilayers
reveals that the latter are more suitable for realizing stacks of many flat
bands. On the other hand, Bernal-stacked graphene heterostructures can realize
topological flat bands. Imposing two simultaneous superlattice potentials
enhances the viability of both regimes.

<h3>Stress anisotropy in polymer brushes and its effects on wetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12562" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12562</a>

Polymer brushes, coatings consisting of densely grafted macromolecules, have
been known to experience an intrinsic lateral compressive stress, originating
from chain elasticity and excluded volume interactions. This lateral stress
complicates a proper definition of the interface and, thereby, of the
interfacial tension. Moreover, its effect on wettability has remained unclear.
Here, we study the link between grafting-induced compressive lateral stress in
polymer brushes, interfacial tension, and brush wettability using
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. A central result is that the
liquid contact angle is independent of grafting density, which implies that the
strength of the compressive stress inside brush has no influence on the
wettability. Interestingly, though the interfacial tensions lack a proper
definition, the difference in interfacial tension between wet and dry brushes
is perfectly well-defined. We confirm explicitly from Young's law that this
difference offers an accurate description of the brush wettability. It is
demonstrated how these results can be explained from the fact that the
compressive stress appears "symmetrically" in wet and dry brushes. We discuss
our findings in the light of autophobic dewetting and point out the connection
to the Shuttleworth effect for wetting on elastomers.

<h3>Abelian Sandpiles on Cylinders</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study here a variant of the Abelian Sandpile Model, where the playground
is a cylinder of width $w$ and of circumference c. When c << w, we describe a
phenomenon which has not been observed in other geometries: the probability
distribution of avalanche sizes has a ladder structure, with the first step
consisting of avalanches of size up to w c/2 that are essentially equiprobable,
except for a small exponential tail of order about 10c. We explain this
phenomenon and describe subsequent steps.

<h3>Moment potentials for spectral density functional theory: Exploiting the  momentum distribution of the uniform electron gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12624" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12624</a>

In standard Kohn-Sham (KS) density-functional theory (DFT) the valence band
satellites in Ni and Pd are missing, the band widths in Ni and Na are too
large, and the formation of lower and upper Hubbard bands in SrVO$_3$ is not
described. These spectral features may be corrected by constructing the
spectral function from the first four spectral moments, which may be obtained
numerically efficiently within a \textit{moment-functional based spectral
density functional theory} (MFbSDFT). In order to obtain a suitable potential
for the second moment, one may use existing models of the uniform electron gas
(UEG). However, models for the third moment of the UEG are not yet available.
Therefore, we show that reproducing the momentum distribution of the UEG within
the two-pole approximation of the spectral function determines the third
moment, when the second moment is given. This allows us to find a model for the
second and third moment potentials, which reproduces the experimental spectra
of Ni, Pd, Na, and SrVO$_3$, and which is consistent with the second moment of
the UEG at low density. Additionally, we describe an efficient algorithm to
compute the spectral function from the first $2P$ spectral moment matrices,
which paves the way to increasing the accuracy of MFbSDFT by using more than 4
spectral moments.

<h3>Thermal Transport Imaging in the Quantum Hall Edge Channel</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12628</a>

Research focused on heat transport in the quantum Hall (QH) edge channel has
successfully addressed fundamental theoretical questions surrounding the QH
physics. However, the picture of the edge channel is complicated by the
phenomenon of energy dissipation out of the edge, and theories treating this
dissipation are lacking. More experimental data is also needed to determine the
coupling mechanism by which energy leaves the edge channel. We developed a
method to map the heat transport in the QH edge to study the dissipation of
heat. We locally heated the QH edge and locally detected the temperature
increase while continuously varying the distance between heater and
thermometer. We thereby obtained the thermal decay length of the edge state,
which we found to depend on magnetic field strength.

<h3>Observation of non-Hermitian corner states in non-reciprocal  topolectrical circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12637" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12637</a>

<br>
<br>
Exploring topological phases in non-Hermitian systems has attracted
significant recent attention. One intriguing question is how topological edge
states compete with the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we report the
experimental observation of corner states in a two-dimensional non-reciprocal
rhombus honeycomb electric circuit. The system is non-reciprocal and
non-Hermitian because the introduced capacitance between two nodes depends on
the current direction. The current-inversion negative impedance converters
(INIC) is employed to realize the non-reciprocal coupling in circuit. Skin
effect thus emerges due to the non-reciprocity and prevails in dragging the
corner state into the bulk. The non-Bloch winding number defined in generalized
Brillouin zone is adopted to characterize the topological phase transition.
Interestingly, we find that the non-Bloch Z2 Berry phase can serve as an
invariant to describe the non-Hermitian topology. By tuning the non-reciprocal
parameter, we observe unbalanced distribution of corner states emerging on two
acute angles of the rhombus lattice, with the localization length of the left
corner state increasing exponentially with the degree of non-reciprocity.

<h3>Dimensionality-confined superconductivity within SrNbO3-SrTiO3  heterostructures</h3>

Interfaces between transition-metal oxides are able to host two-dimensional
electron gases (2DEGs) and exhibit exotic quantum phenomena. Here we report the
observation of superconductivity below 230 mK for the heterostructure composed
of SrNbO3 (SNO) and SrTiO3 (STO). Different from some other counterparts with
two insulators, the metallic SNO provides a novel mechanism to form a quasi
2DEG by charge transfer from bulk towards interface under strain. The
superconductivity, residing within the strained SNO layer near the interface,
is contributed by an electron system with record-low carrier density. Notably,
although embedded in a normal metallic layer with a carrier density 4 to 5
orders higher, the electron system is still uniquely well-protected to retain
high mobility and lies deep in extreme quantum regime.

<h3>Velocity jump process with volume exclusions in a narrow channel</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12654" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12654</a>
<br>
<i>Gayani Tennakoon, Stephen W. Taylor</i>
<br>
<br>
This paper analyses the impact of collisions in a system of $N$ identical
hard-core particles driven according to a velocity jump process. The physical
space is essentially a channel in $\mathbb{R}$ with a probability of occupants
being able to pass each other. The system mimics what nature does, where
individuals pass one another in a narrow channel while making incidental
contact with those moving in the opposite direction. The passing probability
may depend on the particles' size and the channel's width. Starting from the
particle level model, we systematically derive a nonlinear transport equation
based on an asymptotic expansion. Under low-occupied fractions, numerical
solutions of both the kinetic model and the stochastic particle system are
compared well during biased and unbiased random velocity changes. Analysis of
the subpopulation motility within a large population exhibits the consequences
of volume exclusions and channel confinements on the travelling speeds.

<h3>Intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect and gate-switchable Berry curvature  sliding in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
Though the observation of quantum anomalous Hall effect and nonlocal
transport response reveals nontrivial band topology governed by the Berry
curvature in twisted bilayer graphene, some recent works reported nonlinear
Hall signals in graphene superlattices which are caused by the extrinsic
disorder scattering rather than the intrinsic Berry curvature dipole moment. In
this work, we report a Berry curvature dipole induced intrinsic nonlinear Hall
effect in high-quality twisted bilayer graphene devices. We also find that the
application of the displacement field substantially changes the direction and
amplitude of the nonlinear Hall voltages, as a result of a field-induced
sliding of the Berry curvature hotspots. Our work not only proves that the
Berry curvature dipole could play a dominant role in generating the intrinsic
nonlinear Hall signal in graphene superlattices with low disorder densities,
but also demonstrates twisted bilayer graphene to be a sensitive and
fine-tunable platform for second harmonic generation and rectification.

<h3>Anatomy of ultrafast quantitative magneto-acoustics in freestanding  nickel thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12673" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12673</a>
<br>
<i>Antonia Ghita, Tudor-Gabriel Mocioi, Alexey M. Lomonosov, Jiwan Kim, Oleksandr Kovalenko, Paolo Vavassori, Vasily V. Temnov</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the quantitative analysis of the ultrafast magneto-acoustic
experiment in a freestanding nickel thin film by Kim and Bigot [1] by applying
our recently proposed approach of magnetic and acoustic eigenmodes
decomposition by Vernik et al. [2]. We show that the application of our
modeling to the analysis of time-resolved reflectivity measurements allows for
the determination of amplitudes and lifetimes of standing perpendicular
acoustic phonon resonances with unprecedented accuracy. The acoustic damping is
found to scale as $\propto\omega^2$ for frequencies up to 80~GHz and the peak
amplitudes reach $10^{-3}$. The experimentally measured magnetization dynamics
for different orientations of an external magnetic field agrees well with
numerical solutions of magneto-elastically driven magnon harmonic oscillators.
Symmetry-based selection rules for magnon-phonon interactions predicted by our
modeling approach allow for the unambiguous discrimination between spatially
uniform and non-uniform modes, as confirmed by comparing the resonantly
enhanced magneto-elastic dynamics simultaneously measured on opposite sides of
the film. Moreover, the separation of time scales for (early) rising and (late)
decreasing precession amplitudes provide access to magnetic (Gilbert) and
acoustic damping parameters in a single measurement.

<h3>The exact susceptibility of spin-S transverse Ising chain with  next-nearest-neighbor interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12693" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12693</a>
<br>
<i>Kazuhiko Minami</i>
<br>
<br>
The zero-field susceptibility of spin-S transverse Ising chain with
next-nearest-neighbor interactions is obtained exactly. The susceptibility is
given in an explicit form for S=1/2, and expressed in terms of the eigenvectors
of the transfer matrix for general spin S. It is found that the low-temperature
limit is independent of spin S, and is divergent at the transition point.

<h3>Spin-to-charge conversion by spin pumping in sputtered polycrystalline  Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12697</a>

<br>
<br>
Topological materials are of high interest due to the promise to obtain low
power and fast memory devices based on efficient spin-orbit torque switching or
spin-orbit magnetic state read-out. In particular, sputtered polycrystalline
Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ is one of the materials with more potential for this purpose
since it is relatively easy to fabricate and has been reported to have a very
high spin Hall angle. We study the spin-to-charge conversion in
Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ using the spin pumping technique coming from the ferromagnetic
resonance in a contiguous permalloy thin film. We put a special emphasis on the
interfacial properties of the system. Our results show that the spin Hall angle
of Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ has an opposite sign to the one of Pt. The charge current
arising from the spin-to-charge conversion is, in contrast, lower than Pt by
more than one order of magnitude. We ascribe this to the interdiffusion of
Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ and permalloy and the changes in chemical composition produced
by this effect, which is an intrinsic characteristic of the system and is not
considered in many other studies.

<h3>Dissecting Quantum Phase Transition in the Transverse Ising Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12702" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12702</a>
<br>
<i>Yun-Tong Yang, Hong-Gang Luo</i>
<br>
<br>
Irrespective of the fact that a complete theoretical description of critical
phenomena in connection with phase transition has been well-established through
the renormalization group formalism, the understanding of the phase transition
itself remains incomplete. For example, the questions like why and how the
phase transition happens are still unclear. Here we provide a pattern picture
to dissect the quantum phase transition occurring in the transverse Ising model
for a finite lattice. After the validity of the pattern formulation obtained is
confirmed, the energy contributions of different patterns to the ground state
energy provide a sufficient detail to show why and how the phase transition
takes place. Furthermore, a histogram of patterns' occupancy calculated by the
projections of ground state wavefunction on the patterns also shows the
detailed process of the phase transition. Our results are not only fundamental
in understanding the mechanism of phase transition, but also of practical
interest in quantum simulation platforms.

<h3>Novel scaling law governing stock price dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12703" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12703</a>

<br>
<br>
A stock market is typically modeled as a complex system where the purchase,
holding or selling of individual stocks affects other stocks in nonlinear and
collaborative ways that cannot be always captured using succinct models. Such
complexity arises due to several latent and confounding factors, such as
variations in decision making because of incomplete information, and differing
short/long-term objectives of traders. While few emergent phenomena such as
seasonality and fractal behaviors in individual stock price data have been
reported, universal scaling laws that apply collectively to the market are
rare. In this paper, we consider the market-mode adjusted pairwise correlations
of returns over different time scales ($\tau$), $c_{i,j}(\tau)$, and discover
two such novel emergent phenomena: (i) the standard deviation of the
$c_{i,j}(\tau)$'s scales as $\tau^{-\lambda}$, for $\tau$ larger than a certain
return horizon, $\tau_0$, where $\lambda$ is the scaling exponent, (ii)
moreover, the scaled and zero-shifted distributions of the $c_{i,j}(\tau)$'s
are invariant of $\tau > \tau_0$. Our analysis of S\&P500 market data collected
over almost $20$ years ($2004-2020$) demonstrates that the twin scaling
property holds for each year and across $2$ decades (orders of magnitude) of
$\tau$. Moreover, we find that the scaling exponent $\lambda$ provides a
summary view of market volatility: in years marked by unprecedented financial
crises -- for example $2008$ and $2020$ -- values of $\lambda$ are
substantially higher. As for analytical modeling, we demonstrate that such
scaling behaviors observed in data cannot be explained by existing theoretical
frameworks such as the single- and multi-factor models. To close this gap, we
introduce a promising agent-based model -- inspired by literature on swarming
-- that displays more of the emergent behaviors exhibited by the real market
data.

<h3>Finite-temperature avalanches in 2D disordered Ising models</h3>

We study the qualitative and quantitative properties of the Barkhausen noise
emerging at finite temperatures in random Ising models. The random-bond Ising
Model is studied with a Wolff cluster Monte-Carlo algorithm to monitor the
avalanches generated by an external driving magnetic field. Satisfactory
power-law distributions are found which expand over five decades, with a
temperature-dependent critical exponent which matches the existing experimental
measurements. We also focus on a Ising system in which a finite fraction of
defects is quenched. Also the presence of defects proves able to induce a
critical response to a slowly oscillating magnetic field, though in this case
the critical exponent associated with the distributions obtained with different
defect fractions and temperatures seems to belong to the same universality
class, with a critical exponent equal to 1.

<h3>Anomalous dimensions of the Smoluchowski coagulation equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12714</a>
<br>
<i>J. Eggers, M. A. Fontelos</i>
<br>
<br>
The coagulation (or aggregation) equation was introduced by Smoluchowski in
1916 to describe the clumping together of colloidal particles through
diffusion, but has been used in many different contexts as diverse as physical
chemistry, chemical engineering, atmospheric physics, planetary science, and
economics. The effectiveness of clumping is described by a kernel $K(x,y)$,
which depends on the sizes of the colliding particles $x,y$. We consider
kernels $K = (xy)^{\gamma}$, but any homogeneous function can be treated using
our methods. For sufficiently effective clumping $1 \ge \gamma > 1/2$, the
coagulation equation produces an infinitely large cluster in finite time (a
process known as the gel transition). Using a combination of analytical methods
and numerics, we calculate the anomalous scaling dimensions of the main cluster
growth, calling into question results much used in the literature. Apart from
the solution branch which originates from the exactly solvable case $\gamma =
1$, we find a new branch of solutions near $\gamma = 1/2$, which violates
scaling relations widely believed to hold universal.

<br>
<br>
Kagome lattices host flat bands due to their frustrated lattice geometry,
which leads to destructive quantum interference of electron wave functions.
Here, we report imaging of the kagome flat band localization in real-space
using scanning tunneling microscopy. We identify both the Fe3Sn kagome lattice
layer and the Sn2 honeycomb layer with atomic resolution in kagome
antiferromagnet FeSn. On the Fe3Sn lattice, at the flat band energy determined
by the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, tunneling spectroscopy
detects an unusual state localized uniquely at the Fe kagome lattice network.
We further show that the vectorial in-plane magnetic field manipulates the
spatial anisotropy of the localization state within each kagome unit cell. Our
results are consistent with the real-space flat band localization in the
magnetic kagome lattice. We further discuss the magnetic tuning of flat band
localization under the spin-orbit coupled magnetic kagome lattice model.

<h3>Finite size effects on hinge states in three-dimensional second-order  topological insulators</h3>

We investigate the finite size effects of a three-dimensional second-order
topological insulator with fourfold rotational symmetry and time-reversal
symmetry. Starting from the effective Hamiltonian of the three-dimensional
second-order topological insulator, we derive the effective Hamiltonian of four
two-dimensional surface states with gaps derived by perturbative methods. Then,
the sign alternation of the mass term of the effective Hamiltonian on the
adjacent surface leads to the hinge state. In addition, we obtain the effective
Hamiltonian and its wave function of one-dimensional gapless hinge states with
semi-infinite boundary conditions based on the effective Hamiltonian of
two-dimensional surface states. In particular, we find that the hinge states on
the two sides of the same surface can couple to produce a finite energy gap.

Thermodynamic and kinetic properties of materials are usually thought of as
unconnected. Relating them is a conceptual challenge with many practical
benefits. Here, based on first principles, we derive a rigorous inequality
relating entropy and diffusion coefficients. It is universal and applicable to
equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium steady states. The relation can be used
to obtain useful bounds for the diffusion coefficient (normal or anomalous)
from the calculated thermodynamic entropy or, conversely, to estimate the
entropy based on measured diffusion coefficients. We demonstrate the validity
and usefulness of the relation through several examples. We discuss its broad
range of applications, in particular, for non-equilibrium systems.

Induced magnetic order in a topological insulator (TI) can be realized either
by depositing magnetic adatoms on the surface of a TI or engineering the
interface with epitaxial thin film or stacked assembly of two-dimensional (2D)
van der Waals (vdW) materials. Herein, we report the observation of spin-phonon
coupling in the otherwise non-magnetic TI Bi$_\mathrm{2}$Te$_\mathrm{3}$, due
to the proximity of FePS$_\mathrm{3}$ (an antiferromagnet (AFM), $T_\mathrm{N}$
$\sim$ 120 K), in a vdW heterostructure framework. Temperature-dependent Raman
spectroscopic studies reveal deviation from the usual phonon anharmonicity
at/below 60 K in the peak position (self-energy) and linewidth (lifetime) of
the characteristic phonon modes of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ (106 cm$^{-1}$ and 138
cm$^{-1}$) in the stacked heterostructure. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) formalism,
where the respective phonon frequencies of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ couple to phonons
of similar frequencies of FePS$_3$ in the AFM phase, has been adopted to
understand the origin of the hybrid magneto-elastic modes. At the same time,
the reduction of characteristic $T_\mathrm{N}$ of FePS$_3$ from 120 K in
isolated flakes to 65 K in the heterostructure, possibly due to the interfacial
strain, which leads to smaller Fe-S-Fe bond angles as corroborated by
computational studies using density functional theory (DFT). Besides, our data
suggest a double softening of phonon modes of Bi$_\mathrm{2}$Te$_\mathrm{3}$
(at 30 K and 60 K), which in turn, demonstrates Raman scattering as a possible
probe for delineating the magnetic ordering in bulk and surface of a hybrid
topological insulator.

<h3>Quantum Geometric Oscillations in Two-Dimensional Flat-Band Solids</h3>

Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered into
artificial superlattices that host flat bands with significant Berry curvature
and provide a favorable environment for the emergence of novel electron
dynamics. In particular, the Berry curvature can induce an oscillating
trajectory of an electron wave packet transverse to an applied static electric
field. Though analogous to Bloch oscillations, this novel oscillatory behavior
is driven entirely by quantum geometry in momentum space instead of band
dispersion. While the orbits of Bloch oscillations can be localized by
increasing field strength, the size of the geometric orbits saturates to a
nonzero plateau in the strong-field limit. In non-magnetic materials, the
geometric oscillations are even under inversion of the applied field, whereas
the Bloch oscillations are odd, a property that can be used to distinguish
these two co-existing effects.

Interplay between fermiology and electron correlation is crucial for
realizing exotic quantum phases. Transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) 1T-TaS2
has sparked a tremendous attention owing to its unique Mott-insulating phase
coexisting with the charge-density wave (CDW). However, how the fermiology and
electron correlation are associated with such properties has yet to be claried.
Here we demonstrate that monolayer 1T-NbTe2 is a new class of two-dimensional
TMD which has the star-of-David lattice similarly to bulk TaS2 and
isostructural monolayer NbSe2, but exhibits a metallic ground state with an
unusual lattice periodicity root19xroot19 characterized by the sparsely
occupied star-of-David lattice. By using angle-resolved photoemission and
scanning-tunneling spectroscopies in combination with first-principles
band-structure calculations, we found that the hidden Fermi-surface nesting and
associated CDW formation are a primary cause to realize this unique correlated
metallic state with no signature of Mott gap. The present result points to a
vital role of underlying fermiology to characterize the Mott phase of TMDs.

We investigate theoretically the superfluidity of a one-dimensional boson
system whose hopping energy is periodically modulated with a zero time average,
which results in the suppression of first-order single-particle hopping
processes. The dynamics of this flat band system is entirely driven by
correlations and described by exotic Hamiltonian and current operators. We
employ exact diagonalization and compare our results with those of the
conventional, undriven Bose-Hubbard system. We focus on the two main
manifestations of superfluidity, the Hess-Fairbank effect and the metastability
of supercurrents, with explicit inclusion of an impurity when relevant. Among
the novel superfluid features, we highlight the presence of a cat-like ground
state, with branches that have opposite crystal momentum but carry the same
flux-dependent current, and the essential role of the interference between the
collective components of the ground-state wave function. Calculation of the
dynamic form factor reveals the presence of an acoustic mode that guarantees
superfluidity in the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>A charge dependent long-ranged force drives tailored assembly of matter  in solution</h3>

The interaction between charged objects in solution is generally expected to
recapitulate two central principles of electromagnetics: (i) like-charged
objects repel, and (ii) they do so regardless of the sign of their electrical
charge. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the solvent plays a hitherto
unforeseen but crucial role in interparticle interactions, and importantly,
that interactions in the fluid phase can break charge-reversal symmetry. We
show that in aqueous solution, negatively charged particles can attract at long
range while positively charged particles repel. In solvents that exhibit an
inversion of the net molecular dipole at an interface, such as alcohols, we
find that the converse can be true: positively charged particles may attract
whereas negatives repel. The observations hold across a wide variety of surface
chemistries: from inorganic silica and polymeric particles to polyelectrolyte-
and polypeptide-coated surfaces in aqueous solution. A theory of interparticle
interactions that invokes solvation at an interface explains the observations.
Our study establishes a specific and unanticipated mechanism by which the
molecular solvent may give rise to a strong and long-ranged force in solution,
with immediate ramifications for a variety of particulate and molecular
processes including tailored self-assembly, gelation and crystallization, as
well as biomolecular condensation, coacervation and phase segregation. These
findings also shed light on the solvent-induced interfacial electrical
potential - an elusive quantity in electrochemistry and interface science
implicated in many natural and technological processes, such as atmospheric
chemical reactions, electrochemical energy storage and conversion, and the
conduction of ions across cell membranes.

<h3>Quadrupole partial orders and triple-$q$ states on the face-centered  cubic lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>Kazumasa Hattori, Takayuki Ishitobi, Hirokazu Tsunetsugu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study $\Gamma_3$ quadrupole orders in a face-centered cubic lattice. The
$\Gamma_3$ quadrupole moments under cubic symmetry possess a unique cubic
invariant in their free energy in the uniform ($q=0$) sector and the triple-q
sector for the X points $q=(2\pi,0,0),(0,2\pi,0)$, and $(0,0,2\pi)$.
Competition between this cubic anisotropy and anisotropic quadrupole-quadrupole
interactions causes a drastic impact on the phase diagram both in the ground
state and at finite temperatures. We show details about the model construction
and its properties, the phase diagram, and the mechanism of the various
triple-$q$ quadrupole orders reported in our preceding letter [J. Phys. Soc.
Jpn. 90, 43701 (2021), arXiv:2102.06346]. By using a mean-field approach, we
analyze a quadrupole exchange model that consists of a crystalline-electric
field scheme with the ground-state $\Gamma_3$ non-Kramers doublet and the
excited singlet $\Gamma_1$ state. We find various triple-$q$ orders in the
four-sublattice mean-field approximation. A few partial orders of quadrupoles
are stabilized in a wide range of parameter space at a higher transition
temperature than single-$q$ orders. With lowering the temperature, these
partial orders undergo phase transitions into further symmetry broken phases in
which nonvanishing quadrupole moments emerge at previously disordered sites.
The obtained phases in the mean-field approximation are investigated by a
phenomenological Landau theory, which clearly shows that the cubic invariant
plays an important role for stabilizing the triple-$q$ states. We also discuss
its implications for recent experiments in a few f- and d-electron compounds.

<h3>The Zoo of Non-Fourier Heat Conduction Models</h3>

The Fourier heat conduction model is valid for most macroscopic problems.
However, it fails when the wave nature of the heat propagation or time lags
become dominant and the memory or/and spatial non-local effects significant --
in ultrafast heating (pulsed laser heating and melting), rapid solidification
of liquid metals, processes in glassy polymers near the glass transition
temperature, in heat transfer at nanoscale, in heat transfer in a solid state
laser medium at the high pump density or under the ultra-short pulse duration,
in granular and porous materials including polysilicon, at extremely high
values of the heat flux, in heat transfer in biological tissues.
In common materials the relaxation time ranges from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-14}$
sec, however, it could be as high as 1 sec in the degenerate cores of aged
stars and its reported values in granular and biological objects varies up to
30 sec. The paper considers numerous non-Fourier heat conduction models that
incorporate time non-locality for materials with memory (hereditary materials,
including fractional hereditary materials) or/and spatial non-locality, i.e.
materials with non-homogeneous inner structure.

<br>
<i>Blagoje Oblak, Benoit Estienne</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider area-preserving deformations of the plane, acting on electronic
wavefunctions through "quantomorphisms" that change both the underlying metric
and the confining potential. We show that adiabatic sequences of such
transformations produce Berry phases that can be written in closed form in
terms of the many-body current and density, even in the presence of
interactions. For a large class of deformations that generalize squeezing and
shearing, the leading piece of the phase is a super-extensive Aharonov-Bohm
term (proportional to N$^2$ for N electrons) in the thermodynamic limit. Its
gauge-invariant subleading partner only measures the current, whose dominant
contribution to the phase stems from a jump at the edge in the limit of strong
magnetic fields. This results in a finite Berry curvature per unit area,
reminiscent of the Hall viscosity. We show that the latter is in fact included
in our formalism, bypassing its standard derivation on a torus and suggesting
realistic experimental setups for its observation in quantum simulators.

<br>
<br>
We observed a light-induced enhancement of the tunneling current propagating
through an array of parallel carbon chains anchored between gold nanoparticles
(NPs). In the presence of laser radiation characterized by a wavelength close
to the plasmon resonance of the NPs, the current-voltage characteristics of
carbon bundle tunnelling junctions demonstrate a pronounced asymmetry between
positive and negative bias values. Such an asymmetry is typical for a Schottky
junction, in general. The resistance of the tunnel junction decreases with the
increase of the optical pumping intensity. We associate the observed effect
with an injection of `hot' carriers created in Au NPs due to the decay of the
surface plasmons accompanied by the charge transfer to the carbon bundles. The
observed phenomenon can be used for non-resonant excitation of excitonic states
in low-dimensional carbon-based structures for single-photon emission, as well
as for photovoltaic applications.

<h3>Theory of superdiffusive spin transport in noncollinear magnetic  multilayers</h3>

<br>
Ultrafast demagnetization induced by femtosecond laser pulses in thin
metallic layers is caused by the outflow of spin-polarized hot electron
currents describable by the superdiffusive transport model. These
laser-generated spin currents can cross the interface into another magnetic
layer and give rise to magnetization dynamics in magnetic spin valves with
noncollinear magnetizations. To describe ultrafast transport and spin dynamics
in such nanostructures we develop here the superdiffusive theory for general
noncollinear magnetic multilayers. Specifically, we introduce an Al/Ni/Ru/Fe/Ru
multilayer system with noncollinear Ni and Fe magnetic moments and analyze how
the ultrafast demagnetization and spin-transfer torque depend on the
noncollinearity. We employ ab initio calculations to compute the spin- and
energy-dependent transmissions of hot electrons at the interfaces of the
multilayer. Taking into account multiple electron scattering at interfaces and
spin mixing in the spacer layer we find that the laser-induced demagnetization
of the Ni layer and magnetization change of the Fe layer strongly depend on the
angle between their magnetizations. Similarly, the spin-transfer torques on the
Ni and Fe layers and the total spin momentum absorbed in the Ni and Fe layer
are found to vary markedly with the amount of noncollinearity.
These results suggest that changing the amount of noncollinearity in magnetic
multilayers one can efficiently control the hot electron spin transport, which
may open a way toward achieving fast, laser-driven spintronic devices.

We consider solitonic excitations above the ground state of $F=1$ spin orbit
coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (SOBECs). The low energy properties of SOBECs
in any of the three branches of the single particle dispersion relation can be
described by suitable scalar nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equations which we
obtain using multiple-scale expansions. This enables us to examine a variety of
different configurations, such as dark solitons associated with higher energy
branches, as well as dark and bright solitons in the lowest branch. The lower
branch can exhibit a ``superstripe'' phase that also supports solitons. In all
cases, we provide explicit expressions for the NLS coefficients, and confirm
their validity with full numerical simulations of the SOBEC system including a
harmonic confining potential.

<br>
<br>
We consider a system of strongly interacting Bosons in two dimensions with
moat band dispersion which supports an infinitely degenerate energy minimum
along a closed contour in the Brillouin zone. The system has been theoretically
predicted to stabilize a chiral spin liquid (CSL) ground state. In the
thermodynamic limit and vanishing densities, $n\rightarrow 0$, chemical
potential, $\mu$, was shown to scale with $n$ as $\mu\sim n^2\log ^2n$. Here we
perform a Monte Carlo simulation to find the parametric window for particle
density, $n \lesssim \frac{k^2_0}{82 \pi}$, where $k_0$ is the linear size of
the moat (the radius for a circular moat), for which the scaling $\sim n^2\log
^2n$ in the equation of state of the CSL is preserved. We variationally show
that the CSL state is favorable in a interval beyond the obtained scale and
present a schematic phase diagram for the system. Our results offer some
density estimates for observing the low-density behavior of CSL in time of
flight experiments with a recently Floquet-engineered moat band system of
ultracold atoms in Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 213401 (2022), and for the recent
experiments on emergent excitonic topological order in imbalanced electron-hole
bilayers.

Liquids near the glass transition exhibit dynamical heterogeneity, i.e. local
relaxation rates fluctuate strongly over space and time. Here we introduce a
simple continuum model that allows for quantitative predictions for the
correlators describing these fluctuations. We find remarkable agreement of the
model predictions for the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$ with numerical
results for a binary hard-sphere (HARD) liquid and for a Kob-Andersen
Lennard-Jones (KALJ) mixture. We explain why the existence and position of the
peak of $\chi_4(t)$ provides no information about the lifetime $\tau_{\rm ex}$
of the heterogeneities. We show that $\chi_4(t)$ depends weakly on $\tau_{\rm
ex}$, but find a way to use this weak dependence to estimate $\tau_{\rm ex}$
from $\chi_4(t)$.

In contemporary physics, especially in condensed matter physics, fermionic
topological order and its protected edge modes are one of the most important
objects. In this work, we propose a systematic construction of the cylinder
partition corresponding to the fermionic or electric fractional quantum Hall
effect (FQHE) and a general mechanism to obtain the candidates of protected
edge modes. In our construction, when the underlying conformal field theory has
the $Z_{2}$ duality defect corresponding to the fermionic $Z_{2}$ electric
particle, we show that the FQH partition function has a fermionic T duality.
This duality is analogous to (hopefully the same as) the dualities in the dual
resonance models, typically known as supersymmetry and gives a renormalization
group (RG) theoretic understanding of topological phases. We also introduce a
modern understanding of the bulk topological degeneracies and the topological
entanglement entropy. This understanding is based on the traditional tunnel
problem and the recent conjecture of correspondence between bulk
renormalization group flow and boundary conformal field theory. Our formalism
gives an intuitive understanding of modern physics of topological ordered
systems in the traditional language of RG and fermionization.

<h3>Gaplessness protected by bulk-edge correspondence</h3>

After almost half a century of Laughlin's celebrated study of the
wavefunctions of integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, there have still
existed difficulties to prove whether the given wavefunction can describe
gapped phase or not in general. In this work, we show the FQH states
constructed from nonunitary conformal field theories (CFTs), such as Gaffiinian
and Haldane-Rezayi states have a difficulty gapping out under preserving
bulk-edge correspondence in the cylinder geometry. Contrary to the common
understandings of the condensed matter communities, the gaplessness for these
systems seems not to come from the negative conformal dimensions of nonunitary
CFTs in this setting at least directly. We propose the difficulty is coming
from the mismatch of monodromy charge and simple charge of underlying CFTs,
known as Galois shuffle. In the Haldane-Rezayi state, this corresponds to the
conjugate operation of the Neveu-Schwartz and Ramond sectors for unitary Weyl
fermion and symplectic fermion. In the Gaffinian state, besides Galois shuffle
structure, the anomalous conformal dimension of the $Z_{2}$ simple current
results in the cylinder partition functions outside of the existing local
quantum field theory. This indicates the existing gapless fractional quantum
Hall states have similar nonlocal structures, similar to deconfined quantum
criticality. Our work opens up a new paradigm which gives a criterion to
predict whether the candidate of topological ordered states are gapped or not,
and local or nonlocal, by revisiting the problem of anomaly and the duality of
symplectic and Dirac fermion.

In this work, we propose a modern view of the integer spin simple currents
which have played a central role in discrete torsion. We reintroduce them as
nonanomalous composite particles constructed from $Z_{N}$ parafermionic field
theories. These composite particles have an analogy with the Cooper pair in the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and can be interpreted as a typical example of
anyon condensation. Based on these $Z_{N}$ anomaly free composite particles, we
propose a systematic construction of the cylinder partition function of $Z_{N}$
fractional quantum Hall effects (FQHEs). One can expect realizations of a class
of general topological ordered systems by breaking the bulk-edge correspondence
of the bosonic parts of these FQH models. We also give a brief overview of
various phenomena in contemporary condensed matter physics, such as $SU(N)$
Haldane conjecture, general gapless and gapped topological order with respect
to the quantum anomaly of simple currents and bulk and boundary renormalization
group flow. Moreover, we point out an analogy with the FQHE and the 2d quantum
gravity coupled to matter, and propose a $Z_{N}$ generalization of
supersymmetry known as "fractional supersymmetry" in the composite
parafermionic theory and study its analogy with quark confinement. Our analysis
gives a simple but general understanding of the contemporary physics of
topological phases in the form of the partition functions derived from the
operator formalism.

Various phenomena (phase transformations, chemical reactions, and friction)
under high pressures in diamond anvil cell are strongly affected by fields of
all components of stress and plastic strain tensors. However, they could not be
measured. Even measured pressure distribution contains significant error. Here,
we suggest coupled experimental-analytical-computational approaches utilizing
synchrotron X-ray diffraction, to solve an inverse problem and find all these
fields and friction rules before, during, and after $\alpha$-$\omega$ phase
transformation in strongly plastically predeformed Zr. Due to advanced
characterization, the minimum pressure for the strain-induced $\alpha$-$\omega$
phase transformation is changed from 1.36 to 2.7 GPa. It is independent of the
compression-shear path. The theoretically predicted plastic strain-controlled
kinetic equation is verified and quantified. Obtained results open
opportunities for developing quantitative high-pressure/stress science,

in the weakly interacting regime while increasing electron correlations provoke
a novel topological quantum phase transition to a $D_4$-symmetric higher-order
topological superconducting state. The symmetry-protected Majorana corner modes
are numerically confirmed with the matrix-product-state technique. Our theory
paves the way for studying correlated higher-order topology with explicit

An electric toroidal dipole (ETD) moment is one of the fundamental dipole
moments as well as electric and magnetic ones. Although it directly couples to
neither an electric nor magnetic field due to its spatial inversion and
time-reversal parities, its ordered state leads to unconventional transverse
responses of the conjugate physical quantities. We here theoretically
investigate nonlinear transverse magnetic susceptibility under the ETD
ordering. By performing a self-consistent mean-field calculation for a five
$d$-orbital model under a tetragonal crystalline electric field and using the
nonlinear Kubo formula, we show that a third-order transverse magnetic
susceptibility corresponding to a uniform magnetization perpendicular to the
external magnetic field becomes nonzero once the ETD moment is ordered.
Moreover, we find that spin-orbital entanglement and a low-lying first excited
crystal-field level are important for realizing large transverse responses.

Parallel electric and magnetic fields applied to Weyl semimetals pump axial
charge via the axial anomaly until balanced by intervalley relaxation. The
resulting nonequilibrium steady state exhibits the chiral magnetic effect as
well as the anomalous Hall effect, which coupled with Maxwell's equations leads
to unstable electromagnetic waves at low frequency and long wavelength. Here,
we show that such chiral magnetic instability manifests itself as anomalous
reflectance of the surface of pumped Weyl semimetal. Depending on electric,
chiral magnetic, and anomalous Hall conductivities, the reflectance is found to
exceed unity in a finite range of frequency for a circularly polarized light
incident along the direction of Weyl node separation.

whole temperature domain. Using this for the intermediate temperature domain
where the transition from coherent to incoherent relaxation occurs, we find
that the slowest relaxation mode shows a first-order phase transition.
Associated with this transition, an unusual non-monotonic
temperature-dependence of the relaxation rate of this mode is also
demonstrated. Contrary to the popular belief, this non-monotony gives rise to a
peculiar but observable behavior where increasing temperature will not only
result in a smaller rate of the slowest relaxation mode but also may lead to a
slower decaying of the magnetization after some relaxing time. Additionally, it
is also shown that magnetization relaxation in this intermediate temperature
domain can only be accurately described by a bi- or tri-exponential form. The
physical reason underlying these features can be attributed to the role of the
quantum tunneling effect and different but comparative relaxation modes. A
simple experiment to confirm our findings on the first-order phase transition
and the non-monotony of the relaxation rate is accordingly proposed.

We examine the quantum tunneling of magnetization in molecular spin in weak
interaction with a bath subject to Redfield master equation. By designing a
microscopic model for a multilevel spin system using only a generic Hamiltonian
and applying stationary approximation for excited doublets/singlets, we derive
a key equation of motion for the quantum tunneling of magnetization process
which is applicable in the whole temperature domain. From this equation, we
find that in general three tunneling rates are needed to accurately describe
the quantum tunneling process. More importantly, behavior of the quantum
tunneling in the intermediate temperature domain where there exists a
transition between incoherent and coherent quantum tunneling is also unraveled
for the first time. Limiting cases at low and high temperature and/or low
magnetic field are also worked out where some popular well-known results are
reproduced. Last but not least, a new interpretation of the quantum tunneling
of magnetization is proposed where we reveal the similarity between this
relaxation process with a driven damped harmonic oscillator.

<br>
<br>
Suitable cluster definitions have allowed researchers to describe many
ordering transitions in spin systems as geometric phenomena related to
percolation. For spin glasses and some other systems with quenched disorder,
however, such a connection is missing to date. Using Monte Carlo simulations,
we study the percolation properties of several classes of clusters occurring in
the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin-glass model in two dimensions. The
Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Coniglio-Klein clusters originally defined for the
ferromagnetic problem do percolate at a temperature that remains non-zero in
the thermodynamic limit. On the Nishimori line, this location is accurately
predicted by an argument due to Yamaguchi. More relevant for the spin-glass
transition are clusters defined on the basis of the overlap of several
replicas. We show that various such cluster types have percolation thresholds
that shift to lower temperature by increasing the system size, in agreement
with the zero-temperature spin-glass transition in two dimensions. The overlap
is linked to the difference in density of the two largest clusters, thus
supporting a picture where the spin-glass transition corresponds to an emergent
density difference of the two largest clusters inside the percolating phase.

We examine the coherence/incoherence transition temperature of a generic
molecular spin. Our results demonstrates that a molecular spin with a high
coherence/incoherence transition temperature should possess a low spin number
and low axiality, or high spin number and high axiality. Interestingly, the
latter is better protected from the magnetic noises than the former and thus be
the best candidate for a robust electron-based molecular spin qubit/qudit. The
transition temperature can be further optimized if a large non-axial component
of the spin Hamiltonian exists.

<h3>E-beam-enhanced solid-state mechanical amorphization of alpha-quartz:  Reducing deformation barrier via localized excess electrons as mobile anions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Under hydrostatic pressure, alpha-quartz undergoes solid-state mechanical
amorphization wherein the interpenetration of SiO4 tetrahedra occurs and the
material loses crystallinity. This phase transformation requires a high
hydrostatic pressure of 14 GPa because the repulsive forces resulting from the
ionic nature of the Si-O bonds prevent the severe distortion of the atomic
configuration. Herein, we experimentally and computationally demonstrate that
e-beam irradiation changes the nature of the interatomic bonds in alpha-quartz
and enhances the solid-state mechanical amorphization at nanoscale.
Specifically, during in situ uniaxial compression, a larger permanent
deformation occurs in alpha-quartz micropillars compressed during e-beam
irradiation than in those without e-beam irradiation. Microstructural analysis
reveals that the large permanent deformation under e-beam irradiation
originates from the enhanced mechanical amorphization of alpha-quartz and the
subsequent viscoplastic deformation of the amorphized region. Further,
atomic-scale simulations suggest that the delocalized excess electrons
introduced by e-beam irradiation move to highly distorted atomic configurations
and alleviate the repulsive force, thus reducing the barrier to the solid-state
mechanical amorphization. These findings deepen our understanding of
electron-matter interactions and can be extended to new glass forming and
processing technologies at nano- and microscale.

Superconductors lacking both inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry
have been attracting much attention as a platform for exotic superconducting
phases and anomalous phenomena, including the superconducting diode effect.
Recent studies revealed intrinsic phases with this symmetry, named anapole
superconductivity and monopole superconductivity, which are $PT$-symmetric
superconducting states with and without Cooper pairs' total momentum,
respectively. To explore characteristic phenomena in these states, we calculate
and predict the superconducting piezoelectric effect and superconducting diode
effect. A close relationship with the finite-$q$ pairing, asymmetric Bogoliubov
spectrum, and quantum geometry is discussed. This study reveals the
piezoelectric and diode effects as potential probes to elucidate exotic
superconducting phases.

Representing crystal structures of materials to facilitate determining them
via neural networks is crucial for enabling machine-learning applications
involving crystal structure estimation. Among these applications, the inverse
design of materials can contribute to next-generation methods that explore
materials with desired properties without relying on luck or serendipity. We
propose neural structure fields (NeSF) as an accurate and practical approach
for representing crystal structures using neural networks. Inspired by the
concepts of vector fields in physics and implicit neural representations in
computer vision, the proposed NeSF considers a crystal structure as a
continuous field rather than as a discrete set of atoms. Unlike existing
grid-based discretized spatial representations, the NeSF overcomes the tradeoff
between spatial resolution and computational complexity and can represent any
crystal structure. To evaluate the NeSF, we propose an autoencoder of crystal
structures that can recover various crystal structures, such as those of
perovskite structure materials and cuprate superconductors. Extensive
quantitative results demonstrate the superior performance of the NeSF compared
with the existing grid-based approach.

<h3>Emergence symmetry protected topological phase in spatially tuned  measurement-only circuit</h3>

Topological phase transition induced by spatially-tuned single-site
measurement is investigated in a measurement-only circuit, in which three
different types of projective measurement operator. Specific spatial setting
and combination of commutation relations among three measurement operators
generate such a transition. In practice, symmetry protected topological (SPT)
phase is recovered on even sublattice by eliminating a projective measurement
disturbing the SPT via applying another spatially-tuned projective measurement
on odd sublattice. We further investigate the critical properties of the phase
transition and find that it has the same critical exponents with the
two-dimensional percolation transition.

<br>
The generation of localized magnetic field gradients by on-chip nanomagnets
is important for a variety of technological applications, in particular for
spin qubits. To advance beyond the empirical design of these nanomagnets, we
propose a systematic and general approach based on the micromagnetic
formulation of an optimal field gradient source. We study the different field
configurations that can be realized and find out quantitatively the most
suitable ferromagnetic layer geometries. Using micromagnetic simulations, we
then investigate the minimum requirements for reaching magnetic saturation in
these nanomagnets. In terms of either longitudinal or transverse field
gradient, the results provide an optimal solution for uniform, saturated
nanomagnets, where the magnetic material can be selected according to the
strength of the external fields that can be used.

<h3>Quasicrystalline Bose glass in the absence of (quasi)disorder</h3>

We study the low-temperature phases of interacting bosons on a
two-dimensional quasicrystalline lattice. By means of numerically exact Path
Integral Monte Carlo simulations, we show that for sufficiently weak
interactions the system is a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, which
develops density modulations for increasing filling factor. The simultaneous
occurrence of sizeable condensate fraction and density modulation can be
interpreted as the analogous, in a quasicrystalline lattice, of supersolid
phases occurring in conventional periodic lattices. For sufficiently large
interaction strength and particle density, global condensation is lost and
quantum exchanges are restricted to specific spatial regions. The emerging
quantum phase is therefore a Bose Glass, which here is stabilized in the
absence of any source of disorder or quasidisorder, purely as a result of the
interplay between quantum effects and quasicrystalline substrate. This finding
clearly indicates that (quasi)disorder is not essential to observe Bose Glass
physics. Our results are of interest for ongoing experiments on
(quasi)disorder-free quasicrystalline lattices.

<h3>Quantum anomalous Hall insulator of composite fermions in twisted  bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
Abstract We theoretically study the realization of quantum anomalous Hall
insulator (QAHI) of composite fermions (CFs) in the twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) system. We show that the moir\'e pattern in TBG is not only able to
provide a commensurate moir\'e superlattice, but also a tunable effective
periodic potential necessary for the realization, without the need of imposing
an additional superstructure as in the conventional GaAs system. These make the
TBG an ideal platform for realizing the QAHI of CFs. We establish the phase
diagram with respect to tunable experimental parameters based on the Dirac CF
theory. We find that the topological property of the system depends critically
on the orbital magnetic susceptibility of CFs, which is not specified in the
pristine Dirac CF theory. The experimental realization of QAHI of CFs would be
helpful for unveiling the magnetic property of CFs and clarifying the issue.

<h3>Efficient exciton generation in a semiconductor quantum dot-metal  nanoparticle composite structure using conventional chirped pulses</h3>

<i>Dionisis Stefanatos, Athanasios Smponias, Ioannis Thanopulos, Emmanuel Paspalakis</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a nanostructure consisting of a semiconductor quantum dot coupled
to a metal nanoparticle, and show with numerical simulations that the exciton
state of the quantum dot can be robustly generated from the ground state even
for small interparticle distances, using conventional chirped pulses with
Gaussian and hyperbolic secant envelopes. The asymmetry observed in the final
exciton population with respect to the chirp sign of the applied pulses is
explained using the nonlinear density matrix equations describing the system,
and is attributed to the real part of the parameter emerging from the
interaction between excitons in the quantum dot and plasmons in the metal
nanoparticle. The simplicity of the conventional chirped pulses, which can also
be easily implemented in the laboratory, make the proposed robust quantum
control scheme potentially useful for the implementation of ultrafast
nanoswitches and quantum information processing tasks with semiconductor
quantum dots.

<i>Daniel G. Allman, Parth Sabharwal, Kevin C. Wright</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on the impact of the extended geometry of a ring-dimple trap on
particle loss heating of a degenerate Fermi gas. When the Fermi level is
slightly greater than the depth of the dimple and a non-degenerate "halo" is
present, the overall heating rate is reduced relative to the case of a bare
ring. We find that the experimentally measured heating rates for the overfilled
dimple are in good agreement with a model of the hole-induced heating caused by
background gas collisions. This suppression of the heating rate can be helpful
for experimental studies of fermionic superfluids in the weak pairing limit,
where achieving and maintaining low temperatures over long time scales is
essential.

<h3>Oscillations in the radiative damping of plasma resonances in a gated  disk of 2D electron gas</h3>

We calculate the absorption spectra of a conductive disk in the presence of a
metal gate. In our analysis, we use the conductivity described by the Drude
model. We examine the frequency and line width of the absorption resonances
associated with the excited plasma waves. They are estimated both numerically
and analytically for the fundamental and axisymmetric plasma modes. The line
width is determined by the collisional and radiative losses. In high mobility
samples, the latter may dominate even when the resonant frequencies can be
described by a standard quasistatic approximation, i.e., neglecting
electromagnetic retardation. Placing a metal near the disk drastically affects
the radiative broadening of the line width due to the interference of
electromagnetic fields created by the disk and the metal charges. Bringing the
disk in close proximity to the gate makes the total field almost vanish. In
that case, the line width is defined solely by the collisional broadening. As
the disk is moved away from the gate, the line width first shows a reduction
since the plasmon transforms into plasmon-polariton, which is dressed with
undamped electromagnetic field surrounding the disk. Then it increases and
exhibits decaying oscillations, reaching the asymptotic value of the ungated
disk.

In this study, combined DFT, SCAPS-1D, and wxAMPS frameworks are used to
investigate the optimized designs of Cs2BiAgI6 double perovskite-based solar
cells. The first-principle calculation is employed to investigate the
structural stability, optical responses, and electronic contribution of the
constituent elements in Cs2BiAgI6 absorber material, where SCAPS-1D and wxAMPS
simulators are used to scrutinize different configurations of Cs2BiAgI6 solar
cells. Here, PCBM, ZnO, TiO2, C60, IGZO, SnO2, WS2, and CeO2 are used as ETL,
and Cu2O, CuSCN, CuSbS2, NiO, P3HT, PEDOT: PSS, Spiro-MeOTAD, CuI, CuO, V2O5,
CBTS, CFTS are used as HTL, and Au is used as a back contact. About ninety-six
combinations of Cs2BiAgI6-based solar cell structures are investigated, in
which eight sets of solar cell structures are identified as the most efficient
structures. Besides, holistic investigation on the effect of different factors
such as the thickness of different layers, series and shunt resistances,
temperature, capacitance, Mott-Schottky and generation-recombination rates, and
J-V (current-voltage density) and QE (quantum efficiency) characteristics is
performed. The results show CBTS as the best HTL for Cs2BiAgI6 with all eight
ETLs used in this work, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of
19.99%, 21.55%, 21.59%, 17.47%, 20.42%, 21.52%, 14.44%, 21.43% with PCBM, TiO2,
ZnO, C60, IGZO, SnO2, CeO2, WS2, respectively. The proposed strategy may pave
the way for further design optimization of lead-free double perovskite solar
cells.

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides host tightly-bound excitons, which
dominate their optoelectronic response even at room temperatures. Light beams
are often used to study these materials with the polarization - often termed as
the spin angular momentum of the light - providing the mechanism for exciting
excitonic states. Light beams, however, can also carry an orbital angular
momentum by creating helical structures of their phase front. In this work, we
consider a Laguerre-Gaussian beam possessing an orbital angular momentum in
addition to the spin angular momentum to create excitons in monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides. We derive optical selection rules that govern
the allowed transitions to various exciton series using symmetry arguments. Our
symmetry considerations show that we can create dark excitons using these
high-order optical beams opening up new avenues for creating long-lived dark
excitons with the potential of exploiting them in quantum information
processing and storage.

Alloys composed of several elements in roughly equimolar composition, often
referred to as high-entropy alloys, have long been of interest for their
thermodynamics and peculiar mechanical properties, and more recently for their
potential application in catalysis. They are a considerable challenge to
traditional atomistic modeling, and also to data-driven potentials that for the
most part have memory footprint, computational effort and data requirements
which scale poorly with the number of elements included. We apply a recently
proposed scheme to compress chemical information in a lower-dimensional space,
which reduces dramatically the cost of the model with negligible loss of
accuracy, to build a potential that can describe 25 d-block transition metals.
The model shows semi-quantitative accuracy for prototypical alloys, and is
remarkably stable when extrapolating to structures outside its training set. We
use this framework to study element segregation in a computational experiment
that simulates an equimolar alloy of all 25 elements, mimicking the seminal
experiments by Cantor et al., and use our observations on the short-range order
relations between the elements to define a data-driven set of Hume-Rothery
rules that can serve as guidance for alloy design. We conclude with a study of
three prototypical alloys, CoCrFeMnNi, CoCrFeMoNi and IrPdPtRhRu, determining
their stability and the short-range order behavior of their constituents.
