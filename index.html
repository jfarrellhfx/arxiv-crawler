<h3>Metastability for Kawasaki dynamics on the hexagonal lattice</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13573v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13573v1</a>

In this paper we analyze the metastable behavior for the Ising model that
evolves under Kawasaki dynamics on the hexagonal lattice $\mathbb{H}^2$ in the
limit of vanishing temperature. Let $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{H}^2$ a finite set
which we assume to be arbitrarily large. Particles perform simple exclusion on
$\Lambda$, but when they occupy neighboring sites they feel a binding energy
$-U<0$. Along each bond touching the boundary of $\Lambda$ from the outside to
the inside, particles are created with rate $\rho=e^{-\Delta\beta}$, while
along each bond from the inside to the outside, particles are annihilated with
rate 1, where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $\Delta>0$ is an activity
parameter. For the choice $\Delta\in{(U,\frac{3}{2}U)}$ we prove that the empty
(resp.\ full) hexagon is the unique metastable (resp.\ stable) state. We
determine the asymptotic properties of the transition time from the metastable
to the stable state and we give a description of the critical configurations.
We show how not only their size but also their shape varies depending on the
thermodynamical parameters. Moreover, we emphasize the role that the specific
lattice plays in the analysis of the metastable Kawasaki dynamics by comparing
the different behavior of this system with the corresponding system on the
square lattice.

Single photon emitters in solid-state crystals have received a lot of
attention as building blocks for numerous quantum technology applications.
Fluorescent defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) stand out due to their
high luminosity and robust operation at room temperature. The identical emitter
fabrication at pre-defined sites is still challenging, which hampers the
integration of these defects in optical systems and electro-optical devices.
Here, we demonstrate the localized fabrication of hBN emitter arrays by
electron beam irradiation using a standard scanning electron microscope with
deep sub-micron lateral precision. The emitters are created with a high yield
and a reproducible spectrum peaking at 575 nm. Our measurements of optically
detected magnetic resonance have not revealed any addressable spin states.
Using density functional theory, we attribute the experimentally observed
emission lines to carbon-related defects, which are activated by the electron
beam. Our scalable approach provides a promising pathway for fabricating room
temperature single photon emitters in integrated quantum devices.

Chaotic lattice models at high temperature are generically expected to
exhibit diffusive transport of all local conserved charges. Such diffusive
transport is usually associated with overdamped relaxation of the associated
currents. Here we show that by appropriately tuning the inter-particle
interactions, lattice models of chaotic fermions at infinite temperature can be
made to cross over from an overdamped regime of diffusion to an underdamped
regime of "hot band sound". We study a family of one-dimensional spinless
fermion chains with long-range density-density interactions, in which the
damping time of sound waves can be made arbitrarily long even as an effective
interaction strength is held fixed. Our results demonstrate that underdamped
sound waves of charge density can arise within a single band, far from
integrability, and at very high temperature.

The statistical properties of the dynamics of energy levels are investigated
in the case of two two-dimensional disordered quantum dot models with nearest
neighbor hopping subjected to external time-dependent perturbations. While in
the first model the external drivings are realized by a continuous variation of
the on-site energies, in the second one it is generated by deformations of a
parabolic potential. We concentrate on the distribution of the spacing,
velocity and curvature of the energy levels and on the statistics of the
avoided level crossings. Our findings show that for both models, albeit under
slightly different conditions, the statistical properties of the these
quantities are in good agreement with those predicted by Random Matrix Theory
(RMT) for the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic ensembles. We also
provide analytic results on the disorder and system size dependence of the
typical magnitudes of the velocities, curvatures of energy levels, and of the
gaps and the asymptotic slopes of the anticrossings. Our results can be
verified experimentally by measurements of single-particle energy spectra in
quantum dots.

<br>
The IR response of a backside illuminated type Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide
(YBCO) transition-edge bolometer (TEB) in a free-membrane configuration is
measured and analyzed. The analysis is based on a comprehensive equivalent
circuit model for the bolometer structure considering all the thermal
parameters of the device. The detector is made using a 450nm superconductive
YBCO thin film grown on about 100 um thick crystalline SrTiO3 (STO) substrate
using an optimized low cost Metal Organic Deposition (MOD) technique. The
backside illuminated structure provided a basis for freely utilizing different
IR absorber materials and structures on the backside of the bolometer in order
to get wide band high radiation absorption coefficient for the device, while
also avoiding any negative effect of the deposition of the absorber layer on
the YBCO thin film properties. The obtained analytical and experimental results
for the backside illuminated bolometer were also compared with the results of
the previously reported front-side illuminated bolometers.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13708v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13708v1</a>
<br>
<i>Aman Kumar, Vikram Tripathi</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ of a $J$-$K$
Kitaev-Heisenberg model and a Zeeman field in the $(111)$ direction in the
light of the recent debate surrounding the possible re-emergence of Ising
topological order (ITO) and half-quantized $\kappa_{xy}/T$ upon
field-suppression of long-range magnetic order in Kitaev materials. We use the
purification-based finite temperature Tensor Network approach making no prior
assumptions about the nature of the excitations: Majorana, visons or spin
waves. For purely Kitaev interactions and fields $h/K \gtrsim 0.02$ sufficient
to degrade ITO, the peak $\kappa_{xy}/T$ monotonously decreases from
half-quantization associated with lower fields - a behavior physically
consistent with vison fluctuation corrections and qualitatively different from
spin wave treatments. In the $J$-$K$ model (ferro-$K$ and antiferro-$J$) in the
vicinity of field-suppressed magnetic order, we found $\kappa_{xy}/T$ to be
significant, with peak magnitudes exceeding half-quantization followed by a
decrease with increasing $h.$ We thus conclude that half-quantized thermal Hall
effect, if observed in the vicinity of field suppressed magnetic order in our
model, is a fine-tuning effect and is not associated with a Majorana Hall state
with ITO.

<br>
<br>
We study the honeycomb lattice $t$-$J$ model using the fermionic tensor
network approach. By examining the ansatz with various unit cells, we discover
several different stripe states with different periods that compete strongly
with uniform states. At very small doping $\delta < 0.05$, we find almost
degenerate uniform $d$-wave superconducting ground states coexisting with
antiferromagnetic order. While at larger doping $\delta > 0.05$, the ground
state is an approximately half-filled stripe ordered state, and the stripe
period decreases with increasing hole doping $\delta$. Furthermore, the stripe
states with the lowest variational energy always display $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave
pairing symmetry.

<br>
<i>Cem Sevik, Jonas Bekaert, Milorad V. Milosevic</i>
<br>
<br>
We show the effect of Cl and S functionalization on the superconducting
properties of layered (bulk) and monolayer niobium carbide (Nb$_2$C) MXene
crystals, based on first-principles calculations combined with Eliashberg
theory. For the bulk layered Nb$_2$CCl$_2$, the calculated superconducting
transition temperature ($T_c$) is in very good agreement with the recently
measured value of 6 K. We show that $T_c$ is enhanced to 10 K for monolayer
Nb$_2$CCl$_2$, due to an increase in the density of states at the Fermi level,
and the corresponding electron-phonon coupling. We further demonstrate a
feasible gate-induced enhancement of $T_c$ up to 40 K for both bulk-layered and
monolayer Nb$_2$CCl$_2$ crystals. For the S-functionalized cases our
calculations reveal the importance of phonon softening in understanding their
superconducting properties. Finally, we predict that Nb$_3$C$_2$S$_2$ in
bulk-layered and monolayer form is potentially superconducting, with a $T_c$
around 30 K. Considering that Nb$_2$C is not superconducting in pristine form,
our findings promote functionalization as a pathway towards robust
superconductivity in MXenes.

<br>
<br>
A longstanding question in water research is the possibility that supercooled
liquid water can undergo a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLT) into high- and
low-density liquids. We used several complementary molecular simulation
techniques to evaluate the possibility of an LLT in an ab initio neural network
model of water trained on density functional theory calculations with the SCAN
exchange correlation functional. We conclusively show the existence of a
first-order LLT and an associated critical point in the SCAN description of
water, representing the first definitive computational evidence for an LLT in
water from first principles.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13603v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13603v1</a>
<br>
<i>Olivier Trpanier, Rmi N. Duchesne, Jrmie J. Boudreault, Ren Ct</i>
<br>
<br>
The topological nature of the band structure of a Weyl semimetal leads to a
number of unique transport and optical properties. For example, the description
of the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a Weyl semimetal with broken
time-reversal and inversion symmetry, for example, requires a modification of
the Maxwell equations by the axion field $\theta \left( \mathbf{r},t\right)
=2\mathbf{b}\cdot \mathbf{r}-2b_{0}t,$ where $2% \mathbf{b}$ is the separation
in wave vector space between two Weyl nodes of opposite chiralities and
$2\hslash b_{0}$ is their separation in energy. In this paper, we study
theoretically how the axion terms $b_{0}$ and $\bf{b}$ modify the frequency
behavior of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity angles $\theta_{K}\left( \omega
\right) $ and $\psi_{K}\left( \omega \right) $ in a Weyl semimetal. Both the
Faraday and Voigt configurations are considered since they provide different
information on the electronic transitions and plasmon excitation. We derive the
Kerr angles firstly without an external magnetic field where the rotation of
the polarization is only due to the axion terms and secondly in a strong
magnetic field where these terms compete with the gyration effect of the
magnetic field. In this latter case, we concentrate on the ultra-quantum limit
where the Fermi level lies in the chiral Landau level and the Kerr and
ellipticity angles have more complex frequency and magnetic field behaviors.

<br>
<br>
We have characterized an electron-irradiated Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x = 0.53)
single-crystal using two different experimental techniques: magneto-optic
measurements and microwave measurements. The crystal has been measured before
as well as after the 2.5 MeV electron irradiation process. After irradiation it
was annealed in a number of steps, between 90 deg C and 180 deg C, and measured
after each annealing step. Most microwave measurements were performed by means
of a copper cavity, taking advantage of the TE011 and TM110 modes, allowing for
the determination of the London penetration depths changes
{\delta}{\lambda}ab(T) and {\delta}{\lambda}c(T), i.e. perpendicular and
parallel to the sample c-axis. Appropriate equations, based on perturbation
theory, were derived to calculate the penetration depths changes
{\delta}{\lambda}ab and {\delta}{\lambda}c for a rectangular prism geometry.
The sample showed a full recovery of its Tc, however the observed behavior of
{\delta}{\lambda}c and {\delta}{\lambda}ab was not monotonic vs annealing
temperature, displaying a minimum of {\delta}{\lambda}c and {\delta}{\lambda}ab
at 120 deg C. This finding was confirmed by magneto-optic measurements, where
besides verifying the sample uniformity and the absence of visible defects, the
lower critical field Hc1 of the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 single-crystal was obtained and
the London penetration depth {\lambda}ab(0) was calculated.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13563v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13563v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Ternary half Heusler alloys are under intense investigations recently towards
achieving high thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT). Of particular interest is
the ZrNiPb based half Heusler (HH) alloy where an optimal value of ZT = 0.7 at
773 K has been achieved by co-doping Sn and Bi at Pb site. In this work, we
identify an excellent ZT of 1.3 in ZrNi1+xPb0.38Sn0.6Bi0.02 (x= 0.03, at 773 K)
composite alloy. This is achieved by synergistic modulation of electronic as
well as thermal properties via introduction of minor phase of full Heusler (FH)
in the HH matrix through compositional tuning approach. These Ni-rich
ZrNi1+xPb0.38Sn0.6Bi0.02 alloys were synthesized via Arc melting followed by
consolidation via Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). These alloys were characterized
by XRD and SEM that shows formation of nanocomposites comprising of HH matrix
phase and FH secondary minor phases. Enhancement in ZT is mainly attributed to
a synchronized increase in power factor and about 25% decrease in its thermal
conductivity. The thermoelectric compatibility factor (S) is also calculated
for all samples. The theoretically calculated thermoelectric device efficiency
of best performing sample ZrNi1.03Pb0.38Sn0.6Bi0.02 is estimated to be 13.6%.
Our results imply that controlled fine tuning in HH compounds through
compositional tuning approach would lead to novel off-stoichiometric HH phases
with enhanced ZT value for efficient thermoelectric device fabrication.

In the present work we propose a generalization of tunneling time in parity

tunneling time in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems and its relation
to spectral singularities is discussed.

We report the effects of passivation on the various properties like
electronic structure, structural stability and optical properties of CdTe in
the different nanostructure forms such as ultra-thin slabs, monolayers,
nanorods and nanotubes. Further, based on these properties, the self-healing
ability of each nanostructure has been predicted. The optical properties
suggest that all of the passivated and specific unpassivated nanostructures are

<br>
<br>
The Zener-Klein (ZK) interband tunneling in graphene layers (GLs) with the
lateral n-i-n and p-i-n junctions results in the nonlinear I-V characteristics
that can be used for the rectification and detection of the terahertz (THz)
signals. The transit time delay of the tunneling electrons and holes in the
depletion regions leads to the phase shift between the THz current and THz
voltage causing the negative dynamic conductance in a certain frequency range
and resulting in the so-called transit-time (TT) instability. The combination
of the ZK tunneling and the TT negative dynamic conductance enables resonant
THz detection and the amplification and generation of THz radiation. We propose
and evaluate the THz devices based on periodic cascade GL p-i-n structures
exhibiting the TT resonances (GPIN-TTDs). Such structures can serve as THz
amplifiers and, being placed in a Fabri-Perot cavity, or coupled to a THz
antenna or using a ring oscillator connection, as THz radiation sources.

<br>
The discovery of superconductivity in layered vanadium-based kagome metals
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$: K, Rb, Cs) has added a new family of materials to the
growing class of possible unconventional superconductors. However, the nature
of the superconducting pairing in these materials remains elusive. We present a
microscopic theoretical study of the leading superconducting instabilities on
the kagome lattice based on spin- and charge-fluctuation mediated Cooper
pairing. The applied methodology includes effects of both on-site and
nearest-neighbor repulsive Coulomb interactions. Near the upper van Hove
filling -- relevant for the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ materials -- we find a rich phase
diagram with several pairing symmetries being nearly degenerate. In particular,
while a substantial fraction of the phase diagram is occupied by a spin-singlet
order parameter transforming as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of
the point group, several nodal spin-triplet pairing states remain competitive.
We compute the band and interaction parameter-dependence of the hierarchy of
the leading superconducting instabilities, and determine the detailed momentum
dependence of the resulting preferred gap structures. Crucially, for moderate
values of the interaction parameters, the individual pairing states depend
strongly on momentum and exhibit multiple nodes on the Fermi surface. We
discuss the properties of these superconducting gap structures in light of
recent experimental developments of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ materials.

<br>
<br>
Macroscale chains have been proposed to give insight into the physics of
molecular polymer systems. Nevertheless, understanding the rheological response
of systems of quasi-one-dimensional semiflexible materials, such as bead-chain
packings, is currently a great challenge. We study the nonlinear rheology of
random assemblies of macroscale chains -- including steel bead chains and
cooked spaghetti -- under oscillatory shear. We show that a universal
transition from localized to wide shear zones occurs upon increasing the strain
amplitude, for a wide range of lengths, flexibilities, and other structural
parameters of the constituent elements. The critical strain amplitude coincides
with the onset of strain stiffening development in the system. We obtain
scaling laws for transition sharpness, shear-zone width, and stiffness
enhancement as a function of chain length. Our findings suggest that the
entanglements between the constituent elements strengthen when approaching the
critical strain amplitude and rapidly become long range, even spanning the
entire finite system for long enough chains. We show that the nonlinear
rheological response is governed by the interplay between increasing stored
elastic forces due to entanglements and increasing contribution of dissipation
with shear rate and interlocking between chains.

<br>
<br>
Coherent wave states such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), which
spontaneously form in an overpopulated magnon gas even at room temperature,
have considerable potential for wave-based computing and information processing
at microwave frequencies. The ability to control the transport properties of
magnon BECs plays an essential role for their practical use. Here, we
demonstrate spatio-temporal control of the BEC density distribution through the
excitation of magnon supercurrents in an inhomogeneously magnetized yttrium
iron garnet film. The BEC is created by microwave parametric pumping and probed
by Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. The desired magnetization profile
is prepared by heating the film with optical patterns projected onto its
surface using a phase-based wavefront modulation technique. Specifically, we
observe a pronounced spatially localized magnon accumulation caused by magnon
supercurrents flowing toward each other originating in two heated regions. This
accumulation effect increases the BEC lifetime due to the constant influx of
condensed magnons into the confinement region. The shown approach to manipulate
coherent waves provides an opportunity to extend the lifetime of freely
evolving magnon BECs, create dynamic magnon textures, and study the interaction
of magnon condensates formed in different regions of the sample.

The inverted band structure discovered in InAs/GaSb quantum well (QW) is
found to host the topological quantum spin Hall (QSH) states. A QSH insulator
hosts counterpropagating spin-polarized edge states that are protected by the
time-reversal symmetry. The latest experiment reported a robust quantized Hall
conductance arising from these QSH states that persists in an in-plane magnetic
field as strong as $12$ Tesla. Based on the result of this experiment, we
present here a precise calculation of the effective in-plane Lande-\textit{g}
factor. We based our calculations on the tight-binding Hamiltonian projected on
a square lattice that reproduces a slightly modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang
(BHZ) Hamiltonian. We also study the topological phase transitions
\textit{w.r.t.} a magnetic doping. At suitable doping, one type of spin states
penetrate to the bulk of the QW and the system also enters the Quantum
Anomalous Hall (QAH) state. We further confirm this through the calculations of
quantum Hall conductance which shows a plateau at $e^2/h$ rather than $2e^2/h$
at such a doping state. The paper predicts a certain range of controllable
parameters in an inverted QW for enabling a dissipationless charge transport
needed for spintronics application.

Single photon emitters in solid-state crystals have received a lot of
attention as building blocks for numerous quantum technology applications.
Fluorescent defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) stand out due to their
high luminosity and robust operation at room temperature. The identical emitter
fabrication at pre-defined sites is still challenging, which hampers the
integration of these defects in optical systems and electro-optical devices.
Here, we demonstrate the localized fabrication of hBN emitter arrays by
electron beam irradiation using a standard scanning electron microscope with
deep sub-micron lateral precision. The emitters are created with a high yield
and a reproducible spectrum peaking at 575 nm. Our measurements of optically
detected magnetic resonance have not revealed any addressable spin states.
Using density functional theory, we attribute the experimentally observed
emission lines to carbon-related defects, which are activated by the electron
beam. Our scalable approach provides a promising pathway for fabricating room
temperature single photon emitters in integrated quantum devices.
