<h3>Twist-Induced Hyperbolic Shear Metasurfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01775" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01775</a>

Following the discovery of moir\'e-driven superconductivity in twisted
graphene multilayers, twistronics has spurred a surge of interest in tailored
broken symmetries through angular rotations, enabling new properties from
electronics to photonics and phononics. Analogously, in monoclinic polar
crystals a nontrivial angle between non-degenerate dipolar phonon resonances
can naturally emerge due to asymmetries in their crystal lattice, and its
variations are associated with intriguing polaritonic phenomena, including
axial dispersion, i.e., a rotation of the optical axis with frequency, and
microscopic shear effects that result in asymmetric loss distributions. So far
these phenomena were restricted to specific mid-infrared frequencies, difficult
to access with conventional lasers, and fundamentally limited by the degree of
asymmetry and the strength of light-matter interactions available in natural
crystals. Here, we leverage twistronics to demonstrate giant axial dispersion
and loss asymmetry of hyperbolic waves in elastic metasurfaces, by tailoring
the angle between coupled pairs of anisotropic metasurfaces. We show extreme
control over elastic wave dispersion via the twist angle, and leverage the
resulting phenomena to demonstrate reflection-free negative refraction, as well
as the application of axial dispersion to achieve diffraction-free
non-destructive testing, whereby the angular direction of a hyperbolic probe
wave is encoded into its frequency. Our work welds the concepts of twistronics,
non-Hermiticity and extreme anisotropy, demonstrating the powerful
opportunities enabled by metasurfaces for tunable, highly directional surface
acoustic wave propagation, of great interest for applications ranging from
seismic mitigation to on-chip phononics and wireless communications, paving the
way towards their translation into emerging photonic and polaritonic
metasurface technologies.

Laser induced shift of atomic states due to the AC-Stark effect has played a
central role in cold-atom physics and facilitated their emergence as analog
quantum simulators. Here, we explore this phenomena in an atomically thin layer
of semiconductor MoSe$_2$, which we embedded in a heterostructure enabling
charge tunability. Shining an intense pump laser with a small detuning from the
material resonances, we generate a large population of virtual collective
excitations, and achieve a regime where interactions with this background
population is the leading contribution to the AC-Stark shift. Using this
technique we study how itinerant charges modify -- and dramatically enhance --
the interactions between optical excitations. In particular, our experiments
show that the interaction between attractive polarons could be two orders of
magnitude stronger than those between bare excitons.

<h3>The Ferris ferromagnetic resonance technique: principles and  applications</h3>

Measurements of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) are pivotal to modern magnetism
and spintronics. Recently, we reported on the Ferris FMR technique, which
relies on large-amplitude modulation of the externally applied magnetic field.
It was shown to benefit from high sensitivity while being broadband. The Ferris
FMR also expanded the resonance linewidth such that the sensitivity to spin
currents was enhanced as well. Eventually, the spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH)
was measurable even in wafer-level measurements that require low current
densities to reduce the Joule heating. Despite the various advantages, analysis
of the Ferris FMR response is limited to numerical modeling where the linewidth
depends on multiple factors such as the field modulation profile and the
magnetization saturation. Here, we describe in detail the basic principles of
operation of the Ferris FMR and discuss its applicability and engineering
considerations. We demonstrated these principles in a measurement of the
orbital Hall effect taking place in Cu, using an Au layer as the orbital to
spin current converter. This illustrates the potential of the Ferris FMR for
the future development of spintronics technology.

<h3>Emergence of collective self-oscillations in minimal lattice models with  feedback</h3>

<br>
<br>
The emergence of collective oscillations and synchronization is a widespread
phenomenon in complex systems. While widely studied in dynamical systems
theory, this phenomenon is not well understood in the context of
out-of-equilibrium phase transitions. Here we consider classical lattice
models, namely the Ising, the Blume-Capel and the Potts models, with a feedback
among the order and control parameters. With linear response theory we derive
low-dimensional dynamical systems for mean field cases that quantitatively
reproduce many-body stochastic simulations. In general, we find that the usual
equilibrium phase transitions are taken over by complex bifurcations where
self-oscillations emerge, a behavior that we illustrate by the feedback Landau
theory. For the case of the Ising model, we obtain that the bifurcation that
takes over the critical point is non-trivial in finite dimensions. We provide
numerical evidence that in 2D the most probable value of the amplitude follows
the Onsager law. We illustrate multi-stability for the case of discontinuously
emerging oscillations in the Blume-Capel model, whose tricritical point is
substituted by the Bautin bifurcation. For the Potts model with q = 3 colors we
highlight the appearance of two mirror stable limit cycles at a bifurcation
line and characterize the onset of chaotic oscillations that emerge at low
temperature through either the Feigenbaum cascade of period doubling or the
Aifraimovich-Shilnikov scenario of a torus destruction. We show that entropy
production singularities as a function of the temperature correspond to change
in the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Our results show that mean-field
behaviour can be described by the bifurcation theory of low-dimensional
dynamical systems, which paves the way for the definition of universality
classes of collective oscillations.

<h3>Emergent strong zero mode through local Floquet engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01835</a>

Periodically driven quantum systems host exotic phenomena which often do not
have any analog in undriven systems. Floquet prethermalization and dynamical
freezing of certain observables, via the emergence of conservation laws, are
realized by controlling the drive frequency. These dynamical regimes can be
leveraged to construct quantum memories and have potential applications in
quantum information processing. Solid state and cold atom experimental
architectures have opened avenues for implementing local Floquet engineering
which can achieve spatially modulated quantum control of states. Here, we
uncover the novel memory effects of local periodic driving in a nonintegrable
spin-half staggered Heisenberg chain. For a boundary-driven protocol at the
dynamical freezing frequency, we show the formation of an approximate strong
zero mode, a prethermal quasi-local operator, due to the emergence of a
discrete global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. This is captured by constructing an
accurate effective Floquet Hamiltonian using a higher-order partially resummed
Floquet-Magnus expansion. The lifetime of the boundary spin can be
exponentially enhanced by enlarging the set of suitably chosen driven sites. We
demonstrate that in the asymptotic limit, achieved by increasing the number of
driven sites, a strong zero mode emerges, where the lifetime of the boundary
spin grows exponentially with system size. The non-local processes in the
Floquet Hamiltonian play a pivotal role in the total freezing of the boundary
spin in the thermodynamic limit. The novel dynamics of the boundary spin is
accompanied by a rich structure of entanglement in the Floquet eigenstates
where specific bipartitions yield an area-law scaling while the entanglement
for random bipartitions scales as a volume-law.

<h3>The phase stability of large-size nanoparticle alloy catalysts at ab  initio quality using a nearsighted force-training approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01846" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01846</a>

CoPt nanoparticle catalysts are integral to commercial fuel cells. Such
systems are prohibitive to fully characterize with electronic structure
calculations. Machine-learned potentials offer a scalable solution; however,
such potentials are only reliable if representative training data can be
employed, which typically requires large electronic structure calculations.
Here, we use the nearsighted-force training approach to make high-fidelity
machine-learned predictions on large nanoparticles with $>$5,000 atoms using
only systematically generated small structures ranging from 38-168 atoms. The
resulting ensemble model shows good accuracy and transferability in describing
relative energetics for CoPt nanoparticles with various shapes, sizes and Co
compositions. It is found that the fcc(100) surface is more likely to form a
L1$_0$ ordered structure than the fcc(111) surface. The energy convex hull of
the icosahedron shows the most stable particles have Pt-rich skins and Co-rich
underlayers. Although the truncated octahedron is the most stable shape across
all sizes of Pt nanoparticles, a crossover to icosahedron exists due to a large
downshift of surface energy for CoPt nanoparticle alloys. The downshift can be
attributed to strain release on the icosahedron surface due to Co alloying. We
introduced a simple empirical model to describe the role of Co alloying in the
crossover for CoPt nanoparticles. With Monte-Carlo simulations we additionally
searched for the most stable atomic arrangement for a truncated octahedron with
equal Pt and Co compositions, and also we studied its order-disorder phase
transition. We validated the most stable configurations with a new highly
scalable density functional theory code called SPARC. Lastly, the
order-disorder phase transition for a CoPt nanoparticle exhibits a lower
transition temperature and a smoother transition, compared to the bulk CoPt
alloy.

<h3>Structurally Constrained Evolutionary Algorithm for the Discovery and  Design of Metastable Phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01873</a>
<br>
<i>Busheng Wang, Katerina P. Hilleke, Samad Hajinazar, Gilles Frapper, Eva Zurek</i>
<br>
<br>
Metastable materials are abundant in nature and technology, showcasing
remarkable properties that inspire innovative materials design. However,
traditional crystal structure prediction methods, which rely solely on
energetic factors to determine a structure's fitness, are not suitable for
predicting the vast number of potentially synthesizable phases that represent a
local minimum corresponding to a state in thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we
present a new approach for the prediction of metastable phases with specific
structural features, and interface this method with the XtalOpt evolutionary
algorithm. Our method relies on structural features that include the local
crystalline order (e.g., the coordination number or chemical environment), and
symmetry (e.g., Bravais lattice and space group) to filter the parent pool of
an evolutionary crystal structure search. The effectiveness of this approach is
benchmarked on three known metastable systems: XeN$_8$, with a two-dimensional
polymeric nitrogen sublattice, brookite TiO$_2$, and a high pressure BaH$_4$
phase that was recently characterized. Additionally, a newly predicted
metastable melaminate salt, $P$-1 WC$_{3}$N$_{6}$, was found to possess an
energy that is lower than two phases proposed in a recent computational study.
The method presented here could help in identifying the structures of compounds
that have already been synthesized, and developing new synthesis targets with
desired properties.

<h3>Phosphorescence and donor-acceptor pair recombination in  laboratory-grown diamonds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01878</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Intense "blue-green" phosphorescence is commonly observed in near colourless
lab-grown high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds following optical
excitation at or above the indirect bandgap. We have employed a holistic
combination of optically-excited time-resolved techniques (in addition to
standard spectroscopic characterisation techniques) to study the physics of
this long-lived phosphorescence and understand luminescence-related charge
transfer processes.
It is shown that the properties of the broad "blue-green" luminescence and
phosphorescence band can be fully explained by emission from neutral
substitutional nitrogen-boron donor-acceptor pairs
($\text{N}_\text{S}^0$...$\text{B}_\text{S}^0$) , once the configurational
change between charge states is considered, and both tunneling between defects
and thermal ionization of donors and acceptors is considered. Significant
concentrations of metastable $\text{N}_\text{S}^-$, are identified after
optical excitation at or above the indirect bandgap. $\text{N}_\text{S}^-$ is
much shallower ($\sim$0.2 eV) than previously thought and plays a key role in
resetting the $\text{N}_\text{S}^0$...$\text{B}_\text{S}^0$ donor-acceptor
pairs.

<h3>Two-dimensional Ising and Potts model with long-range bond disorder: a  renormalization group approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01887" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01887</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Chippari, Marco Picco, Raoul Santachiara</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we provide new analytic results on two-dimensional $q$-Potts
models ($q \geq 2$) in the presence of bond disorder correlations which decay
algebraically with distance with exponent $a$. In particular, our results are
valid for the long-range bond disordered Ising model ($q=2$). We implement a
renormalization group perturbative approach based on conformal perturbation
theory. We extend to the long-range case the RG scheme used in [V. Dotsenko,
Nucl. Phys. B 455 701 23] for the short-range disorder. Our approach is based
on a $2$-loop order double expansion in the positive parameters $(2-a)$ and
$(q-2)$. We will show that the Weinrib-Halperin conjecture for the long-range
thermal exponent can be violated for a non-Gaussian disorder. We compute the
central charges of the long-range fixed points finding a very good agreement
with numerical measurements.

<h3>A fully ab initio approach to inelastic atom-surface scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01892" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01892</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We introduce a universal and fully ab initio theory for inelastic scattering
of any atom from any surface, and apply the theory to helium scattering from
Nb(100). The key aspect making our approach universal is a direct
first-principles evaluation of the scattering atom-electron vertex. By
correcting misleading results from current state-of-the-art theories, this
fully ab initio approach will be critical in guiding and interpreting
experiments that adopt next-generation, non-destructive atomic beam scattering.

<h3>Excitations of quantum Ising chain CoNb2O6 in low transverse field:  quantitative description of bound states stabilized by off-diagonal exchange  and applied field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01948</a>
<br>
<i>Leonie Woodland, Izabella Lovas, M. Telling, D. Prabhakaran, Leon Balents, Radu Coldea</i>
<br>
<br>
We present experimental and theoretical evidence of novel bound state
formation in the low transverse field ordered phase of the
quasi-one-dimensional Ising-like material CoNb$_2$O$_6$. High resolution single
crystal inelastic neutron scattering measurements observe that small transverse
fields lead to a breakup of the spectrum into three parts, each evolving very
differently upon increasing field. We show that this can be naturally
understood starting from the excitations of the ordered phase of the transverse
field Ising model, domain wall quasiparticles (solitons). The transverse field
and a staggered off-diagonal exchange create one-soliton hopping terms with
opposite signs. This leads to a rich spectrum and a special field, when the
strengths of the off-diagonal exchange and transverse field match, at which
solitons become localized; the highest field investigated is very close to this
special regime. We solve this case analytically and find three two-soliton
continua, along with three novel bound states. We also present calculations
using exact diagonalization of a recently refined Hamiltonian model for
CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and using diagonalization of the two-soliton subspace, both of
which provide a quantitative agreement with the observed spectrum. The
theoretical two-soliton model qualitatively and quantitatively captures a
variety of non-trivial features in the observed spectrum, providing insight
into the underlying physics of bound state formation.

<h3>Controlled excitation of rotons in superfluid helium with an optical  centrifuge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01955</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander A. Milner, Valery Milner</i>
<br>
<br>
We experimentally demonstrate a controlled transfer of angular momentum to
roton pairs in superfluid helium. The control is executed with an optical
centrifuge and detected with coherent time- and frequency-resolved Raman
scattering. We show that the sign of the Raman shift, and hence the orientation
of the angular momentum transferred from the laser field to the rotons, is
dictated by the centrifuge. The magnitude of the shift reflects the two-roton
energy and indicates that the centrifuge-induced hot roton pairs are far from
the equilibrium with the colder quantum bath. The observed decay of the
coherent Raman signal suggests that the decoherence is governed by the
scattering on thermal rotons and phonons. The demonstrated method offers ways
of examining microscopic origins of superfluidity by controlling collective
excitations in superfluids.

<h3>Terahertz bolometric detectors based on graphene field-effect  transistors with the composite h-BN/black-P/h-BN gate layers using plasmonic  resonances</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01975" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01975</a>
<br>
<i>M. Ryzhii, V. Ryzhii, M. S. Shur, V. Mitin, C. Tang, T. Otsuji</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose and analyze the performance of terahertz (THz) room-temperature
bolometric detectors based on the graphene channel field-effect transistors
(GC-FET). These detectors comprise the gate barrier layer (BL) composed of the
lateral hexagonal-Boron Nitride black-Phosphorus/ hexagonal-Boron Nitride
(h-BN/b-P/h-BN) structure. The main part of the GC is encapsulated in h-BN,
whereas a short section of the GC is sandwiched between the b-P gate BL and the
h-BN bottom layer. The b-P gate BL serves as the window for the electron
thermionic current from the GC. The electron mobility in the GC section
encapsulated in h-BN can be fairly large. This might enable a strong resonant
plasmonic response of the GC-FET detectors despite relatively lower electron
mobility in the GC section covered by the b-P window BL. The narrow b-P window
diminishes the Peltier cooling and enhances the detector performance. The
proposed device structure and its operation principle promote elevated values
of the room-temperature GC-FET THz detector responsivity and other
characteristics, especially at the plasmonic resonances.

<h3>Thickness-dependent, tunable anomalous Hall effect in hydrogen-reduced  PdCoO$_2$ thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01979" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01979</a>
<br>
<i>Gaurab Rimal, Yiting Liu, Matthew Brahlek, Seongshik Oh</i>
<br>
<br>
It was recently reported that hydrogen-reduced PdCoO$_2$ films exhibit strong
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) with sign tunable anomalous Hall effect
(AHE). Here, we provide extensive thickness-dependent study of this system, and
show that the electronic and magnetic properties are strongly dependent on the
thickness and annealing conditions. Below a critical thickness of 25 nm, AHE
shows clear PMA with hysteresis, and its sign changes from positive to
negative, and back to positive as the annealing temperature increases from 100
$^\circ$C to 400 $^\circ$C. Beyond the critical thickness, both PMA and AHE
hysteresis disappear and the AHE sign remains positive regardless of the
annealing parameters. Our results show that PMA may have a large role on AHE
sign-tunability and that below the critical thickness, competition between
different AHE mechanisms drives this sign change.

<h3>Relativistic Stochastic Dynamics I: Langevin Equation from Observer's  Perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01982" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01982</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Two different versions of relativistic Langevin equation in generic curved
spacetime background are constructed, both are manifestly general covariant. It
is argued that, from the observer's point of view, the version which takes the
proper time of the Brownian particle as evolution parameter contains some
conceptual issues, while the one which makes use of the proper time of the
observer is more physically sound. The two versions of the relativistic
Langevin equation are connected by a reparametrization scheme. In spite of the
issues contained in the first version of the relativistic Langevin equation, it
still permits to extract the physical probability distributions of the Brownian
particles, as is shown by Monte Carlo simulation in the example case of
Brownian motion in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

<h3>Emergent superconductivity in doped ferroelectric hafnia</h3>

<br>
<i>Xu Duan, Shi Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconductivity and ferroelectricity,representing two distinct forms of
ordered states, are typically not found together in the same system, making it
even more difficult to create a connection between them. Here, supported by
first-principles calculations, we propose that Anderson-Blount's
ferroelectric-like metal can be manifested in electron-doped ferroelectric
Pca21 HfO2. In this system, polar phonons and consequently ferroelectricity are
not affected by the presence of itinerant electrons. We find that a nonpolar
optical phonon, being strongly coupled to doped electrons, can acquire a
pronounced electron-phonon coupling strength to activate conventional
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity. The displacements of polar oxygen
atoms in Pca21 HfO2 create a link between ferroelectricity and
superconductivity, enabling a tunable superconducting temperature ranging
approximately from 10 to 30 Kelvin. Owing to hafnia's compatibility with
silicon, we suggest HfO2-based ferroelectric superconductors present an
opportunity to construct high-performing hybrid integrated systems utilizing
switchable quantum states.

<br>
Advanced experimental measurements are crucial for driving theoretical
developments and unveiling novel phenomena in condensed matter and material
physics, which often suffer from the scarcity of facility resources and
increasing complexities. To address the limitations, we introduce a methodology
that combines machine learning with Bayesian optimal experimental design
(BOED), exemplified with x-ray photon fluctuation spectroscopy (XPFS)
measurements for spin fluctuations. Our method employs a neural network model
for large-scale spin dynamics simulations for precise distribution and utility
calculations in BOED. The capability of automatic differentiation from the
neural network model is further leveraged for more robust and accurate
parameter estimation. Our numerical benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of our method in guiding XPFS experiments, predicting model
parameters, and yielding more informative measurements within limited
experimental time. Although focusing on XPFS and spin fluctuations, our method
can be adapted to other experiments, facilitating more efficient data
collection and accelerating scientific discoveries.

<h3>Two types of zero Hall phenomena in few-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The van der Waals antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
represents a promising platform for exploring the layer-dependent magnetism and
topological states of matter. Despite the realization of several quantized
phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator
state, the recently observed discrepancies between magnetic and transport
properties have aroused controversies concerning the topological nature of
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ in the ground state. Here, we demonstrate the existence of two
distinct types of zero Hall phenomena in few-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. In addition
to the robust zero Hall plateau associated with the axion insulator state, an
unexpected zero Hall phenomenon also occurs in some odd-number-septuple layer
devices. Importantly, a statistical survey of the optical contrast in more than
200 MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ reveals that such accidental zero Hall phenomenon arises
from the reduction of effective thickness during fabrication process, a factor
that was rarely noticed in previous studies of 2D materials. Our finding not
only resolves the controversies on the relation between magnetism and anomalous
Hall effect in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, but also highlights the critical issues
concerning the fabrication and characterization of devices based on 2D
materials.

Unlike bilayers or a few layers thick materials, heterostructures are
designer materials formed by assembling different monolayers in any desired
sequence. As a result, while multilayer materials come with their intrinsic
properties, heterostructures can be tailor-made to suit specific applications.
Taking SiH-CdCl 2 as a representative system, we show the potential of
heterostructures for several applications, like piezoelectricity,
photocatalytic water splitting, and tunnel field effect transistor (TFET). Our
study confirms that the characteristics of the heterostructure mainly depend on
the potential difference between the constituent monolayers. From the vast
database of available layered materials, many such combinations with a suitable
potential difference are expected to have similar properties. Our work points
to a vast pool of assembled materials with multifunctionality, an excellent
asset for next-generation device applications.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a family of materials that have high
porosity and structural tunability and hold great potential in various
applications, many of which requiring a proper understanding of the thermal
transport properties. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important
role in characterizing the thermal transport properties of various materials.
However, due to the complexity of the structures, it is difficult to construct
accurate empirical interatomic potentials for reliable MD simulations of MOFs.
To this end, we develop a set of accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned
potentials for three typical MOFs, including MOF-5, HKUST-1, and ZIF-8, using
the neuroevolution potential approach as implemented in the GPUMD package, and
perform extensive MD simulations to study thermal transport in the three MOFs.
Although the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) values of the three MOFs are
all predicted to be smaller than 1 $\rm{W/(m\ K)}$ at room temperature, the
phonon mean free paths (MFPs) are found to reach the sub-micrometer scale in
the low-frequency region. As a consequence, the apparent LTC only converges to
the diffusive limit for micrometer single crystals, which means that the LTC is
heavily reduced in nanocrystalline MOFs. The sub-micrometer phonon MFPs are
also found to be correlated with a moderate temperature dependence of LTC
between those in typical crystalline and amorphous materials. Both the large
phonon MFPs and the moderate temperature dependence of LTC fundamentally change
our understanding of thermal transport in MOFs.

<br>
<br>
With their incomparable time-frequency accuracy, frequency combs have
significantly advanced precision spectroscopy, ultra-sensitive detection, and
atomic clocks. Traditional methods to create photonic, phononic, and magnonic
frequency combs hinge on material nonlinearities which are often weak,
necessitating high power densities to surpass their initiation thresholds,
which subsequently limits their applications. Here, we introduce a novel
nonlinear process to efficiently generate magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) by
exploiting exceptional points (EPs) in a coupled system comprising a
pump-induced magnon mode and a Kittel mode. Even without any cavity, our method
greatly improves the efficiency of nonlinear frequency conversion and achieves
optimal MFCs at low pump power. Additionally, our novel nonlinear process
enables excellent tunability of EPs using the polarization and power of the
pump, simplifying MFC generation and manipulation. Our work establishes a
synergistic relationship between non-Hermitian physics and MFCs, which is
advantages for coherent/quantum information processing and ultra-sensitive
detection.

We discover a class of spacetime symmetries unique to time-periodic systems,
which we term "mixing symmetry" due to its combination of space and time
coordinates in the symmetry transformation. We systematically enumerate the
symmetry groups, and classify the corresponding Floquet-Bloch band theories by
utilizing the winding number of quasi-energy. Moreover, we provide a
comprehensive scheme for the experimental realization of these symmetries. The
particle propagator exhibits an intriguing pattern that remains invariant even
under transformations mixing space and time coordinates. We anticipate that
this distinct feature can be observed in current cold atom experiments.

We theoretically investigate the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover in a two-dimensional Fermi gas with
the finite-range interaction by using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory.
Expanding the scattering phase shift in terms of the scattering length and
effective range, we discuss the effect of the finite-range interaction on the
pairing and thermodynamic properties. By solving the gap equation and the
number equation self-consistently, we numerically calculate the effective-range
dependence of the pairing gap, chemical potential, and pair size throughout the
BCS-BEC crossover. Our results would be useful for further understanding of
low-dimensional many-body problems.

Magnetic van der Waals heterostructures provide a unique platform to study
magnetism and spintronics device concepts in the two-dimensional limit. Here,
we report studies of exchange bias from the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr
acting on the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT). The orientation of the
exchange bias is along the in-plane easy axis of CrSBr, perpendicular to the
out-of-plane anisotropy of the FGT, inducing a strongly tilted magnetic
configuration in the FGT. Furthermore, the in-plane exchange bias provides
sufficient symmetry breaking to allow deterministic spin-orbit torque switching
of the FGT in CrSBr/FGT/Pt samples at zero applied magnetic field. A minimum
thickness of the CrSBr greater than 10 nm is needed to provide a non-zero
exchange bias at 30 K.

<h3>The conflict between self-interaction and updating passivity in the  evolution of cooperation</h3>

<br>
<i>Chaoqian Wang, Wenqiang Zhu, Attila Szolnoki</i>
<br>
<br>
In social dilemmas under weak selection, the capacity for a player to exhibit
updating passivity or interact with its own strategy can lead to conflicting
outcomes. The central question is which effect is stronger and how their
simultaneous presence influences the evolution of cooperation. We introduce a
model that considers both effects using different weight factors. We derive
theoretical solutions for the conditions of cooperation success and the
cooperation level under weak selection, scanning the complete parameter space.
When the weight factors are equally strong, the promoting effect of
self-interaction to cooperation surpasses the inhibitory effect of updating
passivity. Intriguingly, however, we identify non-monotonous
cooperation-supporting effects when the weight of updating passivity increases
more rapidly. Our findings are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations and
demonstrate robustness across various game types, including the prisoner's
dilemma, stag-hunt, and snowdrift games.

<br>
We present a theoretical study of electrical current fluctuations and
finite-frequency noise in a double quantum dot connected to two electron
reservoirs with the aim of deriving the Fano factor, the $\Delta T$-noise and
the cross-correlations. This allows one to highlight several interesting
features. Firstly the possibility of getting a significant reduction of current
noise and Fano factor either when the system is placed in a given operating
regime, or when a temperature gradient is applied between the two reservoirs,
resulting from the fact that a negative $\Delta T$-noise is generated. The
second feature is the sign change found in the cross-correlator between the two
reservoirs with increasing frequencies. This study clarifies the understanding
of the results obtained experimentally in such systems.

<h3>Critical behaviours of anisotropic XY ferromagnet in the presence of  random field</h3>

<br>
<br>
The anisotropic XY ferromagnet has been studied by Monte Carlo simulation in
a three dimensional simple cubic lattice. The increase in critical temperature
(ferro-para transition) has been noticed with increasing the strength of
anisotropy. The effects of random fields (both with full circular symmetry and
in angular window) on the critical temperature are investigated systematically
in the anisotropic XY ferromagnet in three dimensions. Reduction in the
critical temperature of anisotropic XY ferromagnet has been observed in the
presence of random field. The compensating field (the required amount of field
which preserves the critical temperature for isotropic XY ferromagnet) has been
studied as a function of the strength of anisotropy. The compensating field was
found to depend linearly on the strength of anisotropy. We have also studied
the effects of random field confined in the angular window and observed the
reduction of the critical temperature with increase of the angular extension.
The critical behaviours are formalized by the usual finite size analysis and
the estimation of critical exponents for the susceptibility and the specific
heat. .

<br>
Altermagnets are an emerging third elementary class of magnets. Unlike
ferromagnets, their distinct crystal symmetries inhibit magnetization while,
unlike antiferromagnets, they promote strong spin polarization in the band
structure. The corresponding unconventional mechanism of timereversal symmetry
breaking without magnetization in the electronic spectra has been regarded as a
primary signature of altermagnetism, but has not been experimentally visualized
to date. We directly observe strong time-reversal symmetry breaking in the band
structure of altermagnetic RuO$_2$ by detecting magnetic circular dichroism in
angle-resolved photoemission spectra. Our experimental results, supported by ab
initio calculations, establish the microscopic electronic-structure basis for a
family of novel phenomena and functionalities in fields ranging from
topological matter to spintronics, that are based on the unconventional
time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnets.

Solutions of macromolecules can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to
form droplets with ultra-low surface tension. Droplets with such low surface
tension wet and spread over common surfaces such as test tubes and microscope
slides, complicating \textit{in vitro} experiments. Development of an universal
super-repellent surface for macromolecular droplets has remained elusive
because their ultra-low surface tension requires low surface energies.
Furthermore, nonwetting of droplets containing proteins poses additional
challenges because the surface must remain inert to a wide range of chemistries
presented by the various amino-acid side-chains at the droplet surface. Here,
we present a method to coat microscope slides with a thin transparent hydrogel
that exhibits complete dewetting (contact angles $\theta\approx180^\circ)$ and
minimal pinning of phase-separated droplets in aqueous solution. The hydrogel
is based on a swollen matrix of chemically crosslinked polyethylene glycol
diacrylate of molecular weight 12 kDa (PEGDA), and can be prepared with basic
chemistry lab equipment. The PEGDA hydrogel is a powerful tool for \textit{in
vitro} studies of weak interactions, dynamics, and internal organization of
phase-separated droplets in aqueous solutions.

<h3>Tunable Bose-Einstein condensation and roton-like excitation spectra  with dipolar exciton-polaritons in crossed fields</h3>

<br>
<br>
We develop the many-body theory of dipolar exciton-polaritons in an optical
microcavity in crossed transverse electric and in-plane magnetic fields. Even
for relatively weak fields, we reveal the existence of two minima in the bare
lower-polariton dispersion, which give rise to the tuneable transition between
the polariton Bose-Einstein condensate and that of excitons, produced by the
competition between these minima. We predict that such dipolar condensate
exhibits a roton-maxon character of the excitation spectrum, never before
observed for polaritons. We show that upon the transition between the two
condensation regimes, the weak correlations in the polariton gas give way to
the intermediate interparticle correlations characteristic for excitons, and
that the transition is accompanied by a sharp quenching of photoluminescence as
the lifetime is increased by several orders of magnitude. While in the
polariton regime, the luminescence peak corresponding to the condensate is
shifted to a non-zero angle. The angular dependence of the two-photon decay
time in the Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment is calculated and used as a tool
to evidence the formation of the macroscopically-coherent state. Our proposal
opens opportunities towards manipulating the superfluid properties and
extended-range dipole-dipole correlations of exciton-polariton condensates.

of our derived formula for the random bond Ising model are further elucidated.

<br>

We present a novel analytical model for analysing the spectral
photoluminescence quantum yield of non-planar semiconductor thin films. This
model considers the escape probability of luminescence and is applied to
triple-cation perovskite thin films with a 1-Sun photoluminescence quantum
yield approaching 25%. By using our model, we can decouple the internal
radiative, external radiative, and non-radiative bi-molecular recombination
coefficients. Unlike other techniques that measure these coefficients
separately, our proposed method circumvents experimental uncertainties by
avoiding the need for multiple photoluminescence measurement techniques. We
validate our model by comparing the extracted implied open-circuit voltage,
effective luminescence escape probabilities, absorptivity, and absorption
coefficient with values obtained using established methods and found that our
results are consistent with previous findings. Next, we compare the implied
1-Sun radiative open-circuit voltage and radiative recombination current
obtained from our method with literature values. We then convert the implied
open-circuit voltage and implied radiative open-circuit voltage to the
injection-dependent apparent-effective and apparent-radiative carrier
lifetimes, which allow us to decouple the different recombination coefficients.
Using this lifetime analysis, we predict the efficiency losses due to each
recombination mechanism. Finally, by comparing several different thicknesses,
we conclude that the non-radiative bimolecular recombination is likely caused
by surface recombination. Our proposed analytical model provides a reliable
method for analysing the spectral photoluminescence quantum yield of
semiconductor thin films, which will facilitate further research into the
photovoltaic properties of these materials.

Bulk solid state synthesis of nitride materials usually leads to
thermodynamically stable, cation-ordered crystal structures, whereas thin film
synthesis tends to favor disordered, metastable phases. This dichotomy is
inconvenient both for basic materials discovery, where non-equilibrium thin
film synthesis methods can be useful to overcome reaction kinetic barriers, and
for practical technology applications where stable ground state structures are
sometimes required. Here, we explore the uncharted Mg-W-N chemical phase space,
using rapid thermal annealing to reconcile the differences between thin film
and bulk powder syntheses. Combinatorial co-sputtering synthesis from Mg and W
targets in a N$_2$ environment yielded cation-disordered Mg-W-N phases in the
rocksalt (0.1< Mg/(Mg+W) <0.9), and hexagonal boron nitride (0.7< Mg/(Mg+W)
<0.9) structure types. In contrast, bulk synthesis produced a cation-ordered
polymorph of MgWN$_2$ that consists of alternating layers of rocksalt-like
[MgN$_6$] octahedra and nickeline-like [WN$_6$] trigonal prisms (denoted
"rocksaline"). Thermodynamic calculations corroborate these observations,
showing rocksaline MgWN$_2$ is stable while other polymorphs are metastable. We
also show that rapid thermal annealing can convert disordered rocksalt films to
this cation-ordered polymorph near the MgWN$_2$ stoichiometry. Electronic
structure calculations suggest that this rocksalt-to-rocksaline structural
transformation should also drive a metallic-to-semiconductor transformation. In
addition to revealing three new phases (rocksalt MgWN$_2$ and Mg$_3$WN$_4$,
hexagonal boron nitride Mg$_3$WN$_4$, and rocksaline MgWN$_2$), these findings
highlight how rapid thermal annealing can control polymorphic transformations,
adding a new strategy for exploration of thermodynamic stability in uncharted
phase spaces.

Composite quasi-particles with emergent functionalities in spintronic and
quantum information science can be realized in correlated materials due to
entangled charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom. Here we show
that by reducing the lateral dimension of correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3
flakes to tens of nanometers, we can switch-off the bulk spin-orbit entangled
exciton in the near-infrared (1.47 eV) and activate visible-range (1.8 to 2.2
eV) transitions with charge-transfer character. These ultra-sharp lines (<120
ueV at 4.2 K) share the spin-correlated nature of the bulk exciton by
displaying a Neel temperature dependent linear polarization. Furthermore,
exciton photoluminescence lineshape analysis reveals a polaronic character via
coupling with at-least 3 phonon modes and a comb-like Stark effect through
discretization of charges in each layer. These findings augment the knowledge
on the many-body nature of excitonic quasi-particles in correlated
antiferromagnets and also establish the nanoscale platform as promising for
maturing integrated magneto-optic devices.

While topological phases have been extensively studied in amorphous systems
in recent years, it remains unclear whether the random nature of amorphous
materials can give rise to higher-order topological phases that have no
crystalline counterparts. Here we theoretically demonstrate the existence of
higher-order topological insulators in two-dimensional amorphous systems that
can host more than six corner modes, such as eight or twelve corner modes.
Although individual sample configuration lacks crystalline symmetry, we find
that an ensemble of all configurations exhibits an average crystalline symmetry
that provides protection for the new topological phases. To characterize the
topological phases, we construct two topological invariants. Even though the
bulk energy gap in the topological phase vanishes in the thermodynamic limit,
we show that the bulk states near zero energy are localized, as supported by
the level-spacing statistics. Our findings open an avenue for exploring average
symmetry protected higher-order topological phases in amorphous systems without
crystalline counterparts.

Machine learning (ML) enables the development of interatomic potentials that
promise the accuracy of first principles methods while retaining the low cost
and parallel efficiency of empirical potentials. While ML potentials
traditionally use atom-centered descriptors as inputs, different models such as
linear regression and neural networks can map these descriptors to atomic
energies and forces. This begs the question: what is the improvement in
accuracy due to model complexity irrespective of choice of descriptors? We
curate three datasets to investigate this question in terms of ab initio energy
and force errors: (1) solid and liquid silicon, (2) gallium nitride, and (3)
the superionic conductor LGPS. We further investigate how these errors affect
simulated properties with these models and verify if the improvement in fitting
errors corresponds to measurable improvement in property prediction. Since
linear and nonlinear regression models have different advantages and
disadvantages, the results presented herein help researchers choose models for
their particular application. By assessing different models, we observe
correlations between fitting quantity (e.g. atomic force) error and simulated
property error with respect to ab initio values. Such observations can be
repeated by other researchers to determine the level of accuracy, and hence
model complexity, needed for their particular systems of interest.

Binary uranium hydrides, UHx (x = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), with different
crystal symmetries are potentially interesting compounds for high-Tc
superconductivity and as hydrogen storage systems. In this work we have
explored the structural, elastic, mechanical, bonding, and thermophysical
properties of these systems under uniform pressure via density functional
theory based computations. Most of the results disclosed in this work are
novel. From the calculations of the cohesive energy and enthalpy of formation,
we have found that the titled compounds are chemically stable. The computed
elastic constants at different pressures ensure elastic stability. All the
binary hydrides are mechanically anisotropic. Pressure induced brittle-ductile
transition takes place under high pressure. The compounds are machinable with
the cubic {\alpha}-UH3-Pm-3n showing very high value of the machinability
index. All the compounds are fairly hard with cubic UH8 showing superhard
character. The Debye temperatures and acoustic velocities of these compounds
are high; the highest value is found for the cubic UH8. The melting
temperature, Gr\"uneisen parameter, minimal phonon thermal conductivity, and
the thermal expansion coefficient of these compounds have also been studied at
different pressures. All these parameters show excellent correspondence with
the estimated Debye temperature, elastic parameters and bonding
characteristics.

Exciton-polaritons are bosonic-like elementary excitations in semiconductors,
which have been recently shown to display large occupancy of topologically
protected polariton bound states in the continuum in suitably engineered
photonic lattices [Nature {\bf 605}, 447 (2022)], compatible with the
definition of polariton condensation. However, a full theoretical description
of such condensation mechanism that is based on a non equilibrium
Gross-Pitaevskii formulation is still missing. Given that the latter is well
known to account for polariton condensation in conventional semiconductor
microcavities, here we report on its multi-mode generalization, showing that it
allows to fully interpret the recent experimental findings in patterned
photonic lattices, including emission characteristics and condensation
thresholds. Beyond that, it is shown that the polariton condensation in these
systems is actually the result of an interplay between negative mass
confinement of polariton eigenstates (e.g., due to the photonic gap originated
from the periodic pattern in plane) and polariton losses. We are then able to
show that polariton condensation can also occur in gap-confined bright modes,
i.e., coupling of QW excitons to a dark photonic mode is not necessarily
required to achieve a macroscopic occupation with low population threshold.

We investigate the role of quantum fluctuations in the dynamics of a bosonic
Josephson junction in $D$ spatial dimensions, by using beyond mean-field
Gaussian corrections. We derive some key dynamical properties in a systematic
way for $D=3, 2, 1$. In particular, we compute the Josephson frequency in the
regime of low population imbalance. We also obtain the critical strength of the
macroscopic quantum self-trapping. Our results show that quantum corrections
increase the Josephson frequency in spatial dimensions $D=2$ and $D=3$, but
they decrease it in the $D=1$ case. The critical strength of macroscopic
quantum self-trapping is instead reduced by quantum fluctuations in $D=2$ and
$D=3$ cases, while it is enhanced in the $D=1$ configuration.

Self-healing slip pulses are major spatiotemporal failure modes of frictional
systems, featuring a characteristic size $L(t)$ and a propagation velocity
$c_{\rm p}(t)$ ($t$ is time). Here, we develop a theory of slip pulses in
realistic rate-and-state dependent frictional systems. We show that slip pulses
are intrinsically unsteady objects, yet their dynamical evolution is closely
related to their unstable steady-state counterparts. In particular, we show
that each point along the time-independent $L^{\mbox{{(0)}}}\!(\tau_{\rm
d})\!-\!c^{\mbox{{(0)}}}_{\rm p}\!(\tau_{\rm d})$ line, obtained from a family
of steady-state pulse solutions parameterized by the driving shear stress
$\tau_{\rm d}$, is unstable. Nevertheless, and remarkably, the
$c^{\mbox{{(0)}}}_{\rm p}[L^{\mbox{{(0)}}}]$ line is a dynamic attractor such
that the unsteady dynamics of slip pulses -- whether growing
($\dot{L}(t)\!>\!0$) or decaying ($\dot{L}(t)\!<\!0$) -- reside on the
steady-state line. The unsteady dynamics along the line are controlled by a
single slow unstable mode. The slow dynamics of growing pulses, manifested by
$\dot{L}(t)/c_{\rm p}(t)\!\ll\!1$, explain the existence of sustained pulses,
i.e.~pulses that propagate many times their characteristic size without
appreciably changing their properties. Our theoretical picture of unsteady
frictional slip pulses is quantitatively supported by large-scale, dynamic
boundary-integral method simulations.

Higher-order Weyl semimetals are a family of recently predicted topological
phases simultaneously showcasing unconventional properties derived from Weyl
points, such as chiral anomaly, and multidimensional topological phenomena
originating from higher-order topology. The higher-order Weyl semimetal phases,
with their higher-order topology arising from quantized dipole or quadrupole
bulk polarizations, have been demonstrated in phononics and circuits. Here, we
experimentally discover a class of higher-order Weyl semimetal phase in a
three-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC), exhibiting the concurrence of the
surface and hinge Fermi arcs from the nonzero Chern number and the nontrivial
generalized real Chern number, respectively, coined a real higher-order Weyl
PhC. Notably, the projected two-dimensional subsystem with kz = 0 is a real
Chern insulator, belonging to the Stiefel-Whitney class with real Bloch
wavefunctions, which is distinguished fundamentally from the Chern class with
complex Bloch wavefunctions. Our work offers an ideal photonic platform for
exploring potential applications and material properties associated with the
higher-order Weyl points and the Stiefel-Whitney class of topological phases.

<h3>New exact solutions for the evaporation flux density of a small droplet  on a flat horizontal substrate with a contact angle in the range of 135-180  degrees</h3>

Previously [arXiv:2103.15582v3], an expression was proposed for the
evaporation flux density of a small liquid droplet having the shape of an
axisymmetric spherical segment deposited on a horizontal substrate. The
dependence of the flux density on the polar angle was established for arbitrary
contact angles. This formula has the form of an integral and is rather
complicated for use in modeling algorithms. An approximate expression was
obtained for the evaporation flux density at small contact angles. However, the
question of which simplified formulas should be appropriate to apply in other
ranges of contact angles, for example, in the case of obtuse angles remains
open. In this paper, we propose new exact solutions for the set of discrete
"hydrophobic" contact angles. As an example, very simple exact expressions are
obtained explicitly for the evaporation flux density for droplets with contact
angles 135 and 150 degrees that do not contain integral dependencies. They can
also be used as approximate solutions for a narrow range of contact angles
around the specified values.

Studying the effect of mechanical perturbations on granular systems is
crucial for understanding soil stability, avalanches, and earthquakes. We
investigate a granular system as a laboratory proxy for fault gouge. When
subjected to a slow shear, granular materials typically exhibit a stress
overshoot before reaching a steady state. We find that short seismic pulses can
reset a granular system flowing in steady state so that the stress overshoot is
regenerated. This new feature is shown to determine the stability of the
granular system under different applied stresses in the wake of a perturbation
pulse and the resulting dynamics when it fails. Using an analytical
aging-rejuvenation model for describing the overshoot response, we show that
our laboratory-derived theoretical framework, can quantitatively explain data
from two fault slip events triggered by seismic waves.

<h3>Why shot noise does not generally detect pairing in mesoscopic  superconducting tunnel junctions</h3>

The shot noise in tunneling experiments reflects the Poissonian nature of the
tunneling process. The shot noise power is proportional to both the magnitude
of the current and the effective charge of the carrier. Shot-noise spectroscopy
thus enables - in principle - to determine the effective charge q of the charge
carriers that tunnel. This can be used to detect electron pairing in
superconductors: in the normal state, the noise corresponds to single electron
tunneling (q = 1e), while in the paired state, the noise corresponds to q = 2e,
because of Andreev reflections. Here, we use a newly developed amplifier to
reveal that in typical mesoscopic superconducting junctions, the shot noise
does not reflect the signatures of pairing and instead stays at a level
corresponding to q = 1e. We show that transparency can control the shot noise
and this q = 1e is due to the large number of tunneling channels with each
having very low transparency. At such transparencies, the shot noise in the
junction resembles that of a metallic instead of a superconducting tunnel
junction. Our results indicate that in typical mesoscopic superconducting
junctions one should expect q = 1e noise, and lead to design guidelines for
junctions that allow the detection of electron pairing.

The effect of ring stiffness and pressure on the glassy dynamics of a thermal
assembly of two-dimensional ring polymers is investigated using extensive
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. In all cases, dynamical slowing
down is observed with increasing pressure and thereby a phase space for
equilibrium dynamics is identified in the plane of obtained monomer density and
ring stiffness. When the rings are highly flexible, i.e. low ring stiffness,
glassiness sets in via crowding of crumpled polymers which take a globular
form. In contrast, at large ring stiffness, when the rings tend to have large
asphericity under compaction, we observe the emergence of local domains having
orientational ordering, at high pressures. Thus, our simulations highlight how
varying the deformability of rings leads to contrasting mechanisms in driving
the system towards the glassy regime.

Precise prediction of phase diagrams in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
is challenging due to the simultaneous need for long time scales, large length
scales and accurate interatomic potentials. We show that thermodynamic
integration (TI) from low-cost force fields to neural network potentials (NNPs)
trained using density-functional theory (DFT) enables rapid first-principles
prediction of the solid-liquid phase boundary in the model salt NaCl. We use
this technique to compare the accuracy of several DFT exchange-correlation
functionals for predicting the NaCl phase boundary, and find that the inclusion
of dispersion interactions is critical to obtain good agreement with
experiment. Importantly, our approach introduces a method to predict
solid-liquid phase boundaries for any material at an ab-initio level of
accuracy, with the majority of the computational cost at the level of classical
potentials.

The $Ta-Cu$ and $NbS{e}_{2}-Cu$ heterocontacts have been studied. For $Ta-Cu$
contacts the theoretical estimation of the value of $\delta$-functional barrier
at the boundary arising due to the mismatch of Fermi parameters of the
contacting metals was carried out and a good agreement between the calculation
and experiment was obtained. An expression for the estimation of the diameter
of the heterocontact on either side of the boundary is obtained. The magnitude
of the jump-like decrease in the excess current (and the superconducting gap)
due to the phase transition of the superconductor region near the point contact
into a spatially inhomogeneous state when the critical concentration of
nonequilibrium quasiparticles is reached has been determined. Obtained
dependence of the additive differential resistance on the offsets at the
contact arising after the phase transition, due to the excess charge of
quasiparticles and the associated reverse current (or additive voltage). In
$2H-NbS{{e}_{2}}$ there is a two-zone superconductivity character with $\sim$8
times different energy gap values. Under the influence of current injection of
nonequilibrium quasiparticles there is a sequential phase transition of the
layers adjacent to the point contact into a spatially inhomogeneous state with
a suppressed gap, which is accompanied by a step change in the slope of the
$I-V$ curve with a discrete increase in the differential resistance.

We have synthesized high-quality single crystal samples of the erbium-based
triangular lattice compound Ba3Er(BO3)3. Thermal and magnetic measurements
reveal large anisotropy and a possible phase transition at 100 mK. The
low-temperature magnetic heat capacity can be understood from the two Wyckoff
positions that the magnetic ions Er3+ occupy, which have distinct symmetry
properties and crystal field environments. A point charge calculation for the
crystal electric field levels is consistent with this understanding. Based on
symmetry analysis and classical simulation, we argue that Ba3Er(BO3)3 realizes
an interesting two-sublattice exchange physics, in which the honeycomb lattice
spins develop ferromagnetic correlations due to the additional spins at the
hexagon centers but eventually order antiferromagnetically. Additionally, our
results suggest that quantum fluctuations need to be considered in order to
fully explain the experimental observations.

<h3>Theory of hot-carrier generation in bimetallic plasmonic catalysts</h3>

Bimetallic nanoreactors in which a plasmonic metal is used to funnel solar
energy towards a catalytic metal have recently been studied experimentally, but
a detailed theoretical understanding of these systems is lacking. Here, we
present theoretical results of hot-carrier generation rates of different Au-Pd
nanoarchitectures. In particular, we study spherical core-shell nanoparticles
with a Au core and a Pd shell as well as antenna-reactor systems consisting of
a large Au nanoparticle with acts as antenna and a smaller Pd satellite
nanoparticle separated by a gap. In addition, we investigate an antenna-reactor
system in which the satellite is a core-shell nanoparticle. Hot-carrier
generation rates are obtained from an atomistic quantum-mechanical modelling
technique which combines a solution of Maxwell's equation with a tight-binding
description of the nanoparticle electronic structure. We find that
antenna-reactor systems exhibit significantly higher hot-carrier generation
rates in the catalytic material than the core-shell system as a result of
strong electric field enhancements associated with the gap between the antenna
and the satellite. For these systems, we also study the dependence of
hot-carrier generation rate on the size of the gap, the radius of the antenna
nanoparticle and the direction of light polarization. Our insights pave the way
towards a mechanistic understanding of hot-carrier generation in heterogeneous
nanostructures for photocatalysis and other energy conversion applications.

<h3>Performance of near-optimal protocols in weak processes</h3>

<br>
<i>Pierre Nazé</i>
<br>
<br>
A natural criticism of the universal optimal protocol of the irreversible
work found in the context of weak processes is its experimental difficulty to
be implementable due to its singular part. In this work, I propose as a partial
solution to this problem its continuous linear part as an acceptable
near-optimal protocol. This is based on the analysis of several examples of the
error committed to approximating the solution extended until its second order
in its continuous linear part. The result seems to be universal: depending
mainly on the ratio between switching time and waiting time $\tau/\tau_w$, the
error for sudden and slowly-varying processes is less than $1\%$, while for
$\tau\approx\tau_w$ it has a peak with an upper bound around $8\%$. Although
implementing Dirac deltas could be an experimental challenge, I present also
the error including those functions, where the results of these new
near-optimal protocols become slightly better.

Under the assumption that shape variations are energetically neutral and
system's rigidity can be neglected, pressure becomes the only mechanical
control parameter in equilibrium phase diagrams describing structural phase
transitions in solids. We show that the account of rigidity on the
corresponding 'coherent' or 'kinetic' phase diagrams can lead to the appearance
of critical points that do not exist in purely liquid systems. We develop a
general theory of such rigidity-induced critical points and illustrate the
results by applying them to geometrically nonlinear description of a zero
temperature equilibrium response of an isotropic solid undergoing a volumetric
phase transition.

Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) offer a versatile
platform for exploring band topology, correlated phases, and magnetic orders.
We study the correlated phases in twisted TMD homobilayers and their low energy
collective excitations, focusing on the effect of band topology on magnetism
and thermal stability. From Hartree-Fock theory of the continuum model, we
identify several magnetic and topological phases. By tuning the displacement
field, we find two phase transitions involving a change in topology and
magnetism respectively. We analyze the magnon spectrum, revealing the crucial
role of band topology in stabilizing 2D ferromagnetism by amplifying easy-axis
magnetic anisotropy, resulting in a large magnon gap of up to 7meV. As the
magnon gap is directly tied to the stability of the magnetic phase to thermal
fluctuations, our findings have several important experimental implications.

<h3>Efficient method to calculate energy spectra for analysing  magneto-oscillations</h3>

Magneto-oscillations in two-dimensional systems with spin-orbit interaction
are typically characterized by fast Shubnikov-de~Haas (SdH) oscillations and
slower spin-orbit-related beatings. The characterization of the full SdH
oscillatory behavior in systems with both spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman
coupling requires a time consuming diagonalization of large matrices for many
magnetic field values. By using the Poisson summation formula we can explicitly
separate the density of states into, fast and slow oscillations, which
determine the corresponding fast and slow parts of the magneto-oscillations. We
introduce an efficient scheme of partial diagonalization of our Hamiltonian,
where only states close to the Fermi energy are needed to obtain the SdH
oscillations, thus reducing the required computational time. This allows an
efficient method for fitting numerically the SdH data, using the inherent
separation of the fast and slow oscillations. We compare systems with only
Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and both Rashba and Dresselhaus SOI with,
and without, an in-plane magnetic field. The energy spectra are characterized
in terms of symmetries, which have direct and visible consequences in the
magneto-oscillations. To highlight the benefits of our methodology, we use it
to extract the spin-orbit parameters by fitting realistic transport data.

This theoretical research is devoted to study topological phase transitions
in a two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnetic lattice with unequal
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions for the two sublattices. With the help of a
first-order Green function formalism, we analyze the influence of magnon-magnon
interaction on the magnon band topology. It is found that the existence of the
antichiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can led to a tilting of the
renormalized magnon bands near the Dirac momenta. Then, the renormalized magnon
band gaps at Dirac points have different widths. Through changing the
temperature, we can observe the renormalized magnon band gap closing-reopening
phenomenon, which corresponds to the topological phase transition. Our results
show that the critical temperature of the topological phase transition is
related to the strength of the antichiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

<br>
High-field phase diagram of a chiral-lattice antiferromagnet Sr(TiO)Cu4(PO4)4
is studied by means of the ultrasound, dielectric, and magnetocaloric-effect
measurements. These experimental techniques reveal two new phase transitions at
high fields, which have not been resolved by the previous magnetization
experiments. Specifically, the c66 acoustic mode shows drastic changes with
hysteresis with applied fields along the c axis, indicating a strong
magneto-elastic coupling. Combined with the cluster mean-field theory, we
discuss the origins of these phase transitions. By considering the chiral-twist
effect of Cu4O12 cupola units, which is inherent to the chiral crystal
structure, the phase diagram is reasonably reproduced. The agreement between
the experiment and theory suggests that this material is a unique quasi
two-dimensional spin system with competing exchange interactions and chirality,
leading to the rich phase diagram.

Recent experiments have produced evidence for fractional quantum anomalous
Hall (FQAH) states at zero magnetic field in the semiconductor moir\'e
superlattice system $t$MoTe$_2$. Here we argue that a composite fermion
description, already a unifying framework for the phenomenology of 2d electron
gases at high magnetic fields, provides a similarly powerful perspective in
this new context, despite the absence of a magnetic field. To this end, we
present exact diagonalization evidence for composite Fermi liquid states at
zero magnetic field in $t$MoTe$_2$, at fillings $n=\frac{1}{2}$ and
$n=\frac{3}{4}$. We dub these non-Fermi liquid metals anomalous composite Fermi
liquids (ACFLs), and we argue that they play a central organizing role in the
FQAH phase diagram. We proceed to develop a long wavelength theory for this
ACFL state, which offers concrete experimental predictions upon doping the
composite Fermi sea, including a Jain sequence of FQAH states and a new type of
commensurability oscillations originating from the superlattice potential
intrinsic to the system.

We consider the quantum spin ice models in the planar pyrochlore lattice. The
models are obtained by perturbing the Ising model with different lattice
symmetry preserving quantum fluctuations. We map these models to a compact U(1)
lattice gauge theory and discuss its global symmetries which include the 1-form
U(1) global symmetry. Utilizing the higher form generalization of the
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and also the monopole effect in the compact lattice
gauge theory, we show that these models have "persistent" translation symmetry
breaking valence bond solid phase around the Ising limit even the perturbation
explicitly breaks all the spin rotation symmetry. We find the excitation in
this phase can be described by an abelian Higgs model with charge $\pm2$
monopoles, this model is recently found to have a mixed 't Hooft anomaly. The
one of the consequences of this anomaly is the domain wall in this phase may
support deconfined excitations on it, we explicitly construct a solvable domain
wall carries such anomaly. The spectrum of the excitations is also studied, we
find the spectral weight of the spectrum in the low energy sector along the
high symmetry momentum paths is strongly restricted by the 1-form global
symmetries. Specially, we show the spectrum directly measures on the domain
wall along $q_{2}=\pm q_1$ momentum paths.

Understanding and controlling the motion of superconducting vortices has been
a key issue in condensed matter physics and applied superconductivity. Here we
present a method for macroscopically manipulating the vortices based on
travelling wave flux pump to accurately output industrial-scale DC current into
high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets. DC magnetic fields are used to
adjust the polarity of the vortices and thus modulate the direction of the
output current, which demonstrates that the DC current of the flux pump
originates from the motional electromotive force ( e.m.f. ) other than the
induced e.m.f.. In addition, applying different strengths of DC fields can
modulate the magnitude of the output current. Further numerical simulation
suggests how the flux inside the superconducting tape is controlled by
different applied fields. We build a controlled flux flow model to correctly
explain the behavior of vortices controlled by the flux pump, and how the
motional e.m.f. is created by manipulating the vortices. Based on the method,
we achieve high precision regulation of output current using adaptive control
of the DC magnetic field, allowing the flux pump to output DC current just as
accurate as a typical commercial power supply. This work advances the technic
for macroscopic manipulation of vortices.

We report on the highly efficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) generation in

substrate. By conducting harmonic Hall measurement in
Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ (CoFeB)/SIO bilayers, we characterize two kinds of
the SOTs, i.e., dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike ones to find that the former is
much larger than the latter. By comparison with the Pt control sample with the
same CoFeB thickness, the observed DL SOT efficiency $\xi$$_{DL}$ of SIO
($\sim$0.32) is three times higher than that of Pt ($\sim$0.093). The
$\xi$$_{DL}$ is nearly constant as a function of the CoFeB thickness,
suggesting that the SIO plays a crucial role in the large SOT generation. These
results on the CoFeB/SIO bilayers highlight that the epitaxial SIO is promising
for low-current and reliable spin-orbit torque-controlled devices.

We study spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in Pt/ferrimagnetic insulator
Y$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ (YIG) bilayers by focusing on crystallinity,
magnetization, and interface roughness by controlling post-annealing
temperatures. The SMR in the Pt/YIG grown on Si substrate is comparable to that
grown on widely used Gd$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$O$_{12}$ substrate, indicating that the
large SMR can be achieved irrespective to the crystallinity. We deduced the
spin mixing conductance from the Pt thickness dependence of the SMR to find the
high interface quality of the optimized Pt/YIG grown on Si in terms of spin
current. We also clarified that the SMR correlates well with the magnetization,
the interface roughness, and carrier density. These findings highlight that
optimizing YIG properties is a key to control of magnetization by spin current,
leading to the development of low power consumption spintronic device based on

We use Monte Carlo simulations and tensor network methods to study a
classical monomer-dimer model on the square lattice with a hole (monomer)
fugacity $z$, an aligning dimer-dimer interaction $u$ that favors columnar
order, and an attractive dimer-dimer interaction $v$ between two adjacent
dimers that lie on the same principal axis of the lattice. The Monte Carlo
simulations of finite size systems rely on our grand-canonical generalization
of the dimer worm algorithm, while the tensor network computations are based on
a uniform matrix product ansatz for the eigenvector of the row-to-row transfer
matrix, which work directly in the thermodynamic limit. The phase diagram has
nematic, columnar order and fluid phases, and a nonzero temperature
multicritical point at which all three meet. For any fixed $v/u < \infty$, we
argue that this multicritical point continues to be located at a nonzero hole
fugacity $z_{\rm mc}(v/u) > 0$; our numerical results confirm this theoretical
expectation, but find that $z_{\rm mc}(v/u) \to 0$ very rapidly as $v/u \to
\infty$. Our numerical results also confirm the theoretical expectation that
the corresponding multicritical behavior is in the universality class of the
four-state Potts multicritical point on critical line of the two dimensional
Ashkin-Teller model.

Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has established that for cubic network
phases in diblock copolymer melts, the double-gyroid (DG) is thermodynamically
stable relative to the competitor double-diamond (DD) and double-primitive (DP)
phases, and exhibits a window of stability intermediate to the classical
lamellar and columnar phases. This competition is widely thought to be
controlled by "packing frustration" -- the incompatibility of uniformly filling
melts with a locally preferred chain packing motif. Here, we reassess the
thermodynamics of cubic network formation in strongly-segregated diblock melts,
based on a recently developed medial strong segregation theory ("mSST")
approach that directly connects the shape and thermodynamics of chain packing
environments to the medial geometry of tubular network surfaces. We first show
that medial packing significantly relaxes prior SST upper bounds on the free
energy of network phases, which we attribute to the spreading of terminal chain
ends within network nodal regions. Exploring geometric and thermodynamic
metrics of chain packing in network phases, we show that mSST reproduces
effects dependent on the elastic asymmetry of the blocks that are consistent
with SCFT at large $\chi N$. We then characterize geometric frustration in
terms of the spatially-variant distributions of local entropic and enthalpic
costs throughout the morphologies, extracted from mSST predictions. We find
that the DG morphology, due to its unique medial geometry in the nodal regions,
is stabilized by the incorporation of favorable, quasi-lamellar packing over
much of its morphology, motifs which are inaccessible to DD and DP morphologies
due to "interior corners" in their medial geometries. Finally, we use our
results to analyze "hot spots" of chain stretching and discuss implications for
network susceptibility to the uptake of guest molecules.

In this work, we study the thermalization between two bodies separated by a
vacuum gap by coupling the non-Fourier behavior of the materials with the
radiative heat transfer in the near-field. Unlike the diffusion-type
temperature profile, in non-Fourier materials, the temperature behaves as a
wave, changing the thermalization process. Due to the temperature profile
induced by the coupling with conduction, we show that the radiative heat flux
exchanged between the two bodies differs from the Fourier case, and exhibits
transient temperature effects at the onset of the thermalization process. These
results have important implications in nanoscale thermal management, near-field
solid-state cooling, and nanoscale energy conversion.

In sparse signal processing, this study investigates the effect of the global
shrinkage parameter $\tau$ of a horseshoe prior, one of the global-local
shrinkage prior, on the linear regression. Statistical mechanics methods are
employed to examine the accuracy of signal estimation. A phase diagram of
successful and failure of signal recovery in noise-less compressed sensing with
varying $\tau$ is discussed from the viewpoint of dynamic characterization of
the approximate message passing as a solving algorithm and static
characterization of the free-energy landscape. It is found that there exists a
parameter region where the approximate message passing algorithm can hardly
recover the true signal, even though the true signal is locally stable. The
analysis of the free-energy landscape also provides important insight into the
optimal choice of $\tau$.

<br>
<br>
A simple, reliable and field-free spin orbit torque (SOT)-induced
magnetization switching is a key ingredient for the development of the
electrical controllable spintronic devices. Recently, the SOT induced
deterministic switching of the CoPt single layer has attracts a lot of
interests, as it could simplifies the structure and add new flexibility in the
design of SOT devices, compared with the Ferromagnet/Heavy metal bilayer
counterparts. Unfortunately, under the field-free switching strategies used
nowadays, the switching of the CoPt layer is often partial, which sets a major
obstacle for the practical applications. In this study, by growing the CoPt on
vicinal substrates, we could achieve the full-scale (100% switching ratio)
field-free switching of the CoPt layer. We demonstrate that when grown on
vicinal substrates, the magnetic easy axis of the CoPt could be tilted from the
normal direction of the film plane; the strength of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya
interaction (DMI) would be also be tuned as well. Micromagnetic simulation
further reveal that the field-free switching stems from tilted magnetic
anisotropy induced by the vicinal substrate, while the enhancement of DMI help
reducing the critical switching current. In addition, we also found that the
vicinal substrates could also enhance the SOT efficiency. With such simple
structure, full-scale switching, tunable DMI and SOT efficiency, our results
provide a new knob for the design SOT-MRAM and future spintronic devices.

<br>
<br>
The effects of Ag15+ (120 MeV) swift heavy ion irradiation on the structural
and morphological properties of epitaxial La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 (LPCMO) thin
films was investigated by x-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
techniques. LPCMO films of thickness ~ 280 {\AA} were irradiated with an Ag15+
ion beam at different fluences of 1E11, 5E11, and 1E12 ions/cm2. XRD results
suggested the development of the tensile stress along the out-of-plane
direction of the LPCMO film upon ion irradiation which increased on increasing
the ion fluence. The morphology of the film also modified with the irradiation
and an increase in the fluence of the ion beam enhanced the in-plane
height-height correlation length scale (grain size) with a loss of the fractal
behaviour.

<br>
<br>
Identifying ordered phases and their underlying symmetries is the first and
most important step toward understanding the mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity; critical behaviors of ordered phases are expected to be
correlated with superconductivity. Efforts to find such ordered phases have
been focused on symmetry breaking in the pseudogap region while the Fermi
liquid-like metal region beyond the so-called critical doping $p_{c}$ has been
regarded as a trivial disordered state. Here, we used rotational anisotropy
second harmonic generation and uncovered a broken mirror symmetry in the Fermi
liquid-like phase in (Bi,Pb)$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ with $p =
0.205 > p_{c}$. By tracking the temperature evolution of the symmetry-breaking
response, we verify an order parameter-like behavior with the onset temperature
$T_{up}$ at which the strange metal to Fermi liquid-like-metal crossover takes
place. Complementary angle-resolved photoemission study showed that the
quasiparticle coherence between $\mathrm{CuO_{2}}$ bilayers is enhanced in
proportion to the symmetry-breaking response as a function of temperature,
indicating that the change in metallicity and symmetry breaking are linked.
These observations contradict the conventional quantum disordered scenario for
over-critical-doped cuprates and provide new insight into the nature of the
quantum critical point in cuprates.

<h3>Formation and mechanics of fire ant rafts as an active self-healing  membrane</h3>

<br>
<br>
The unique ability of fire ants to form a raft to survive flooding rain has
enchanted biologists as well as researchers in other disciplines. It has been
established during the last decade that an aggregation of fire ants exhibits
viscoelasticity with respect to external compression and shearing among
numerous unusual mechanical properties. In addition to clarifying that the
Cheerios effect is neither sufficient nor essential for the ant raft, we
perform the force-displacement and creep experiments on the ant raft and
concentrate on unearthing properties that derive from the unique combination of
self-healing and activeness of its constituent. Varying pull speed results in
distinct mechanical responses and fracture patterns, characteristic of ductile
and brittle material. By image processing, we count the number of ants that
actively participate in the stress-strain relation and determine their
orientation to map out the force chain. The latter information reveals that the
pull force expedites the alignment of fire ants, in analogy to the effect of an
electric field on liquid crystal polymers. In addition, the raft can be
tailored not to transversely deform in response to the axial strain. Without
resorting to specific geometry structures, this property of zero Poisson's
ratio is enabled by the active recruitment of ants from the top to bottom layer
to keep the raft from disintegrating. Furthermore, effective Young's modulus
can also be customized and is proportion to either the raft length or its
inverse, depending on whether the raft is in the elastic or plastic region.

<br>
<i>Chiranjit Mondal, Rasoul Ghadimi, Bohm-Jung Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the quantum valley Hall effect and related domain wall modes in
twisted bilayer graphene at a large commensurate angle. Due to the quantum
valley and sub-valley Hall effect, a small deviation from the commensurate
angle generates two-dimensional conducting network patterns composed of
one-dimensional domain wall conducting channels, which can induce non-Fermi
liquid transport behavior within an accessible temperature range. The domain
wall modes can be manipulated by using the layer shifting and external electric
fields which, in turn, leads to the sub-valley Haldane and Semenoff masses on
the domain wall modes. The large-angle twisted bilayer graphene and related
materials can be a new setup to harness the quantum valley and sub-valley Hall
effect with enhanced tunability.

<h3>Quantum Brownian Motion: A Review</h3>

<br>
<i>Aritra Ghosh, Malay Bandyopadhyay, Sushanta Dattagupta, Shamik Gupta</i>
<br>
<br>
We review in a pedagogic manner the topic of quantum Brownian motion, with an
emphasis on its thermodynamic aspects. For the sake of completeness, we begin
with the classical treatment of one-dimensional Brownian motion, discussing
correlation functions and fluctuation-dissipation relations. The
equation-of-motion approach, based on the Langevin equation, is mostly followed
throughout the paper. A microscopic derivation of the generalized Langevin
equation is outlined, based on the microscopic model of a heat bath as a
collection of a large number of independent classical harmonic oscillators. We
then consider a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of Brownian motion based on
the quantum Langevin equation, where the bath is modelled as a collection of
independent quantum harmonic oscillators. In the stationary state, we analyze
the quantum counterpart of energy equipartition theorem, which has generated a
considerable amount of interest in recent literature. The free energy, entropy
and third law of thermodynamics are discussed for the one-dimensional quantum
Brownian motion in a harmonic well. Following this, we explore some aspects of
dissipative diamagnetism in the context of two-dimensional quantum Brownian
motion. The role of an external magnetic field and confining potentials is
discussed. We then briefly outline the path-integral approach to thermodynamics
of a quantum Brownian particle. Finally, we devote a substantial part of the
review to discussing stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in the
context of classical and quantum Langevin equation.

Interactions between the different degrees of freedom form the basis of many
manifestations of intriguing physics in condensed matter. In this respect,
quantifying the dynamics of normal modes that themselves arise from these
interactions and how they interact with other excitations is of central
importance. Of the different types of coupling that are often important,
spin-lattice coupling is relevant to several sub-fields of condensed matter
physics; examples include spintronics, high-TC superconductivity, and
topological materials. While theories of materials where spin-lattice coupling
is relevant can sometimes be used to infer the magnitude and character of this
interaction, experimental approaches that can directly measure it are rare and
incomplete. Here we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to directly access the
spin-lattice coupling by measuring both ultrafast atomic motion and the
associated spin dynamics following the excitation of a coherent electromagnon
by an intense THz pulse in a multiferroic hexaferrite. Comparing the dynamics
of the two different components, one striking outcome is the different phase
shifts relative to the driving field. This phase shift provides insight into
the excitation process of such a coupled mode. This direct observation of
combined lattice and magnetization dynamics paves the way to access the
mode-selective spin-lattice coupling strength, which remains a missing
fundamental parameter for ultrafast control of magnetism and is relevant to a
wide variety of correlated electron physics.

<h3>Note on Angular Momentum of Phonons in Chiral Crystals</h3>

Phonon angular momentum in chiral materials has been widely studied in
spintronics and condensed matter physics. In chiral crystals, this is not the
conserved quantity in contrast to the pseudo-angular momentum. To highlight
this point and to understand the behavior of the angular momentum, we reexamine
phonon dispersion theory based on the irreducible representation of helix and
show the distinction of these angular momentum is originated from chirality.

<br>

We report the creation of dual-species Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of
$^{7}$Li and $^{133}$Cs. These BECs are formed in a bichromatic optical dipole
trap created with 1550-nm and 780-nm laser beams. During the production
process, an external magnetic field of 886~G is applied to adjust the
scattering lengths to $a_{\rm{Cs}} = 123a_0$, $a_{\rm{Li}} = 484a_0$, and
$a_{\rm{LiCs}} = 248a_0$. These scattering lengths allow for efficient
evaporation and sympathetic cooling. The dual-species BECs are typically
produced with $1.5\times 10^4$ Cs atoms and $6.0\times 10^3$ Li atoms. This
quantum degenerate mixture of Li and Cs provides an ideal platform for
exploring phenomena such as polarons and Efimov trimers, as well as for
creating ground-state LiCs molecules.

<h3>Front dynamics in the Harper model</h3>

The front dynamics in the Harper (or Aubry-Andr\'e) model (which has a
localization transition) is investigated using two different settings, particle
number front where the system is at zero temperature, and initially the
particle numbers differ on the two sides, and temperature front where the two
sides have different temperature initially. The two differently prepared half
systems are connected suddenly, and the following dynamics is investigated.
In the extended phase the dynamics is ballistic, similarly to the dynamics of
a pure system. At the critical point one find a power-law time dependence of
the particle number and the entanglement entropy of the zero temperature
setting. In the localized phases, the observables oscillates around an average
value, which is independent of the system size.
The dependence of the mutual information between neighbouring intervals at
the front is found to be logarithmic bought in the interval length and the
time. The prefactors of the logarithms of the time and interval length
dependence are equal up to the precision of the present numerical calculations.
The prefactors in the critical point are smaller than in the extended phase.

chromium ($^{53}$Cr) atoms, currently investigated in our lab, highlighting its
peculiar properties with respect to other Fermi mixtures nowadays available.
Finally, I summarize recent experimental progress achieved in producing and
characterizing this novel system, providing an outlook for future studies based
on ultracold $^6$Li-$^{53}$Cr Fermi mixtures.

<h3>How does a hyperuniform fluid freeze?</h3>

All phase transitions can be categorised into two different types: continuous
and discontinuous phase transitions. Discontinuous phase transitions are
normally accompanied with significant structural changes, and nearly all of
them have the kinetic pathway of nucleation and growth, if the system does not
suffer from glassy dynamics. Here, in a system of barrier-controlled reactive
particles, we find that the discontinuous freezing transition of a
non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluid into an absorbing state does not have the
kinetic pathway of nucleation and growth, and the transition is triggered by
long wavelength fluctuations. The transition rate decreases with increasing the
system size, which suggests that the metastable hyperuniform fluid is
kinetically stable in an infinitely large system. This challenges the common
understanding of metastability in discontinuous phase transitions. Moreover, we
find that the ``metastable yet kinetically stable'' hyperuniform fluid features
a new scaling in the structure factor $S(k \rightarrow 0) \sim k^{1.2}$ in 2D,
which is the third dynamic hyperuniform state in addition to the critical
hyperuniform state with $S(k \rightarrow 0) \sim k^{0.45}$ and the
non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluid with $S(k \rightarrow 0) \sim k^{2}$.

We have discovered a new phenomenon that inductance oscillates as a function
of the angle between an in-plane magnetic field and an electric current
direction in permalloy films, which we have named "the anisotropic
magneto-inductance (AML) effect". We have investigated the dependences of the
AML effect on the size and voltage. The length, frequency, and amplitude
dependences suggest that the AML effect should be evaluated in terms of
"inductivity". Inductors based on this AML effect have the potential to be
variable, on-chip, and one billion times smaller than the small commercial
inductor.

<br>
Stochastic p-Bit devices play a pivotal role in solving NP-hard problems,
neural network computing, and hardware accelerators for algorithms such as the
simulated annealing. In this work, we focus on Stochastic p-Bits based on
high-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (HB-MTJs) with identical stack structure
and cell geometry, but employing different spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching
schemes. We conducted a comparative study of their switching probability as a
function of pulse amplitude and width of the applied voltage. Through
experimental and theoretical investigations, we have observed that the Y-type
SOT-MTJs exhibit the gentlest dependence of the switching probability on the
external voltage. This characteristic indicates superior tunability in
randomness and enhanced robustness against external disturbances when Y-type
SOT-MTJs are employed as stochastic p-Bits. Furthermore, the random numbers
generated by these Y-type SOT-MTJs, following XOR pretreatment, have
successfully passed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
SP800-22 test. This comprehensive study demonstrates the high performance and
immense potential of Y-type SOT-MTJs for the implementation of stochastic
p-Bits.

The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
regime has helped to elucidate some of the key processes that lead to the
manipulation of magnetism on ultrafast timescales. However, as we show in this
paper, the recently introduced spectrally-resolved analysis of such data can
lead to surprising experimental observations, which might cause
misinterpretations. Therefore, an extended analysis of the EUV magneto-optics
is necessary. Via experimental determination of the dielectric tensor, we find
here that the non-equilibrium excitation in an ultrafast magnetization
experiment can cause a rotation of the off-diagonal element of the dielectric
tensor in the complex plane. In direct consequence, the commonly analyzed
magneto-optic asymmetry may show time-dependent behaviour that is not directly
connected to the magnetic properties of the sample. We showcase such critical
observations for the case of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in Ni, and give
guidelines for the future analysis of spectrally-resolved magneto-optical data
and its comparison with theory.

The optical intersite spin transfer (OISTR) effect was recently verified in
Fe$_{50}$Ni$_{50}$ using magneto-optical Kerr measurements in the extreme
ultraviolet range. However, one of the main experimental signatures analyzed in
this work, namely a magnetic moment increase at a specific energy in Ni, was
subsequently found also in pure Ni, where no transfer from one element to
another is possible. Hence, it is a much-discussed issue whether OISTR in FeNi
alloys is real and whether it can be verified experimentally or not. Here, we
present a comparative study of spin transfer in Fe$_{50}$Ni$_{50}$,
Fe$_{19}$Ni$_{81}$ and pure Ni. We conclusively show that an increase in the
magneto-optical signal is indeed insufficient to verify OISTR. However, we also
show how an extended data analysis overcomes this problem and allows to
unambiguously identify spin transfer effects. Concomitantly, our work solves
the long-standing riddle about the origin of delayed demagnetization behavior
of Ni in FeNi alloys.

The strong structure-property coupling in rare-earth nickelates has spurred
the realization of new quantum phases in rapid succession. Recently, topotactic
transformations have provided a new platform for the controlled creation of
oxygen vacancies and, therewith, for the exploitation of such coupling in
nickelates. Here, we report the emergence of oxygen vacancy ordering in
Pr$_{0.92}$Ca$_{0.08}$NiO$_{2.75}$ single crystals obtained via a topotactic
reduction of the perovskite phase Pr$_{0.92}$Ca$_{0.08}$NiO$_{3}$, using
CaH$_2$ as the reducing agent. We unveil a brownmillerite-like ordering pattern
of the vacancies by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy,
with Ni ions in alternating square-pyramidal and octahedral coordination along
the pseudocubic [100] direction. Furthermore, we find that the crystal
structure acquires a high level of internal strain, where wavelike modulations
of polyhedral tilts and rotations accommodate the large distortions around the
vacancy sites. Our results suggest that atomic-resolution electron microscopy
is a powerful method to locally resolve unconventional crystal structures that
result from the topotactic transformation of complex oxide materials.

nature of the inhomogeneous stripe state with a large isotope effect, we
highlight the structural features of cuprates (tilted CuO6 octahedra with
different orientation with respect to rock salt LaO layers), where sources of
charge and spin inhomogeneity can be hidden. We used the Anderson model with
the Jahn-Teller(JT) local cells, where it was shown in the Hartree Fock
approximation the charge inhomogeneity arises at any low doping concentration
$x$ and disappears when the doping level exceeds threshold concentration $x_c$,
at which a nonzero JT displacement (tilting) separate CuO$_6$ octahedron
becomes possible.

Driven-dissipative physics lie at the core of quantum optics. However, the
full interplay between a driven quantum many-body system and its environment
remains relatively unexplored in the solid state realm. In this work, we
inspect this interplay beyond the commonly employed stroboscopic Hamiltonian
picture based on the specific example of a driven superconductor. Using the
Shirley-Floquet and Keldysh formalisms as well as a generalization of the
notion of superconducting fitness to the driven case, we show how a drive which
anti-commutes with the superconducting gap operator generically induces an
unusual particle-hole structure in the spectral functions from the perspective
of the thermal bath. Concomitant with a driving frequency which is near
resonant with the intrinsic cutoff frequency of the underlying interaction,
this spectral structure can be harnessed to enhance the superconducting
transition temperature. Our work paves the way for further studies for
driven-dissipative engineering of exotic phases of matter in solid-state
systems.

Studies of mesoscopic structures have now become a leading and rapidly
evolving research field ranging from physics, chemistry, and mineralogy to life
sciences. The increasing miniaturization of devices with length scales of a few
nanometers is leading to radical changes not only in the realization of new
materials but also in shedding light on our understanding of the fundamental
laws of nature that govern the dynamics of systems at the mesoscopic scale. On
the basis of recent experimental results and previous theoretical research, we
investigate thermodynamic processes in small systems in Onsager's region. We
show that fundamental quantities such as the total entropy production, the
thermodynamic variables conjugate to the thermodynamic fluxes, and the
Glansdorff-Prigogine's dissipative variable may be quantized at the mesoscopic
scale. We establish the canonical commutation rules (ccr) valid at the
mesoscopic scale. The numerical value of the quantization constant is estimated
experimentally.

<br>
<br>
Crack growth in stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in 7xxx Al alloys is an
intermittent process, which generates successive crack arrest markings (CAMs)
visible on the fracture surface. It is conjectured that H is generated at the
crack tip during crack arrest, which then facilitates crack advancement through
hydrogen embrittlement. Here, nanoscale imaging by 4D-scanning-transmission
electron microscopy and atom probe tomography show that CAMs are produced by
oxidation at the arrested crack tip, matrix precipitates dissolve and solute
diffuse towards the growing CAM. Substantial homogenous residual strain remains
underneath the fracture surface, indicative of non-localized plastic activity.
Our study suggests that H induces crack propagation through decohesion.

Interfacing magnetism with superconductivity gives rise to a wonderful
playground for intertwining key degrees of freedom: Cooper pairs, spin, charge,
and spin-orbit interaction, from which emerge a wealth of exciting phenomena,
fundamental in the nascent field of superconducting spinorbitronics and
topological quantum technologies. Magnetic exchange interactions (MEI), being
isotropic or chiral such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI), are
vital in establishing the magnetic behavior at these interfaces as well as in
dictating not only complex transport phenomena, but also the manifestation of
topologically trivial or non-trivial objects as skyrmions, spirals,
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and Majorana modes. Here, we propose a methodology
enabling the extraction of the tensor of MEI from electronic structure
simulations accounting for superconductivity. We apply our scheme to the case
of a Mn layer deposited on Nb(110) surface and explore proximity-induced impact
on the MEI. Tuning the superconducting order parameter, we unveil potential
change of the magnetic order accompanied with chirality switching. Owing to its
simple formulation, our methodology can be readily implemented in
state-of-the-art frameworks capable of tackling superconductivity and
magnetism. Our findings opens intriguing exploration paths, where chirality and
magnetism can be engineered depending on the conducting nature of
magneto-superconducting interfaces. We thus foresee implications in the
simulations and prediction of topological superconducting bits as well as in
cryogenic superconducting hybrid devices involving magnetic units.

Interferometry is a vital tool for studying fundamental features in the
quantum Hall effect (QHE). For instance, Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference in a
quantum Hall interferometer can probe the wave-particle duality of electrons
and quasiparticles. Here, we report an unusual AB interference in a quantum
Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometer (FPI), whose Coulomb interactions were
suppressed with a grounded drain in the interior bulk of the FPI. In a
descending filling factor from $\nu =3$ to $\nu\approx5/3$, the magnetic field
periodicity, which corresponded to a single 'flux quantum,' agreed accurately
with the enclosed area of the FPI. However, in the filling range,
$\nu\approx5/3$ to ${\nu}=1$, the field periodicity increased markedly, apriori
suggesting a drastic shrinkage of the AB area. Moreover, the modulation gate
voltage periodicity decreased abruptly at this range. We attribute these
unexpected observations to a ubiquitous edge reconstruction, leading to
dynamical area changing with the field and a modified modulation gate-edge
capacitance. These results are reproducible and support future interference
experiments with a QHE-FPI.

<h3>Adsorption of CO and NO molecules on pristine, vacancy defected and  doped graphene-like GaN monolayer: A first-principles study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02915</a>
<br>

In order to study the novel gas detection or sensing applications of gallium
nitride monolayer (GaN-ML), we mainly focused on the structural, energetic,
electronic and magnetic properties of toxic gas molecules (CO, NO) adsorbed on
pristine, single vacancy (N-vacancy, Ga-vacancy) defected, and metals (Al, Fe,
Pd and Pt) doped GaN-ML using density functional theory (DFT-D2 method) in this
work. The calculations demonstrate that pristine GaN-ML is extremely
insensitive to CO and NO together with the existence of a weak physisorption
nature due to small adsorption energy, charge transfer, and long adsorption
distance. It is found that both N-vacancy defected GaN-ML and Fe-doped GaN-ML
can significantly increase the adsorption energy and charge transfer for CO.
The CO adsorption induces the metallic characteristics of N-vacancy GaN-ML to
be converted to the half-metallic characteristics together with 100% spin
polarization, and it also drastically changes the magnetic moment, implying
that N-vacancy GaN-ML exhibits excellent sensitivity to CO. However, Fe-doped
GaN-ML is not conducive to CO detection. Moreover, N-vacancy defected and
Pt-doped GaN-ML greatly improve the adsorption ability for NO compared to other
substrates, and the presence of stronger orbital hybridization suggests that
the interaction between them is chemisorption. Therefore, N-vacancy defected
GaN-ML and Pt-doped GaN-ML can serve as potential materials in future NO
sensing devices.

<h3>Superhydrophobicity of Auxetic Metamaterials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Superhydrophobic materials are often inspired by nature, whereas
metamaterials are engineered to have properties not usually found in naturally
occurring materials. In both cases, the key that unlocks their unique
properties is structure. Here, we show that a negative Poisson's ratio
(auxetic) mechanical metamaterial is capable of transforming into a unique type
of superhydrophobic material. When stretched its surface has the
counterintuitive property that it also expands in the orthogonal lateral
direction. We model the change in the solid surface fraction as strain is
applied and show it decreases as the space between solid elements of the
auxetic lattice expands. This results in a unique dependence of the
superhydrophobicity on strain. We construct experimental models illustrating
the relationship between different states of strain and superhydrophobicity as
the lattice structure transitions from an auxetic to a conventional (positive
Poisson's ratio) one. The principles we have discovered offer a new approach to
designing superhydrophobic materials for self-cleaning surfaces, droplet
transportation, droplet encapsulation and oil-water separation.

<h3>Accurate and efficient treatment of spin-orbit coupling via second  variation employing local orbitals</h3>

<br>
<br>
A new method is presented that allows for efficient evaluation of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) in density-functional theory calculations. In the so-called
second-variational scheme, where Kohn-Sham functions obtained in a
scalar-relativistic calculation are employed as a new basis for the
spin-orbit-coupled problem, we introduce a rich set of local orbitals as
additional basis functions. Also relativistic local orbitals can be used. The
method is implemented in the all-electron full-potential code \exciting. We
show that, for materials with strong SOC effects, this approach can reduce the
overall basis-set size and thus computational costs tremendously.

<h3>Boundary criticality via gauging finite subgroups: a case study on the  clock model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02976" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02976</a>

<br>
<br>
Gauging a finite Abelian normal subgroup $\Gamma$ of a nonanomalous 0-form
symmetry $G$ of a theory in $(d+1)$D spacetime can yield an unconventional
critical point if the original theory has a continuous transition where
$\Gamma$ is completely spontaneously broken and if $G$ is a nontrivial
extension of $G/\Gamma$ by $\Gamma$. The gauged theory has symmetry $G/\Gamma
\times \hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$, where $\hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$ is the $(d-1)$-form
dual symmetry of $\Gamma$, and a 't Hooft anomaly between them. Thus it can be
viewed as a boundary of a topological phase protected by $G/\Gamma \times
\hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$. The ordinary critical point, upon gauging, is mapped to
a deconfined quantum critical point between two ordinary symmetry-breaking
phases ($d =1$) or an unconventional quantum critical point between an ordinary
symmetry-breaking phase and a topologically ordered phase ($d\ge 2$) associated
with $G/\Gamma$ and $\hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$, respectively. Order parameters and
disorder parameters, before and after gauging, can be directly related. As a
concrete example, we gauge the $\mathbb{z}_2$ subgroup of $\mathbb{z}_4$
symmetry of a 4-state clock model on a 1D lattice and a 2D square lattice.
Since the symmetry of the clock model contains $D_8$, the dihedral group of
order 8, we also analyze the anomaly structure which is similar to that in the
compactified $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $\theta =\pi$ in $(3+1)$D and its mixed
gauge theory. The general case is also discussed.

<h3>Solid-Lubrication Performance of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ -- Effect of  Tribo-Chemistry and Exfoliation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Multi-layer Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ coatings have demonstrated an outstanding wear
performance with excellent durability due to beneficial tribo-layers formed.
However, the involved formation processes dependent on the tribological
conditions and coating thickness are yet to be fully explored. Therefore, we
spray-coated Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ multi-layer particles onto stainless steel
substrates to create coatings with two different thicknesses and tested their
solid lubrication performance with different normal loads (100 and 200 mN) and
sliding frequencies (1 and 2.4 Hz) using linear-reciprocating ball-on-disk
tribometry. We demonstrate that MXenes' tribological performance depends on
their initial state (delaminated few-layer vs. multi-layer particles), coating
thickness and sliding velocity. Specifically, the best behavior is observed for
thinner multi-layer coatings tested at the lower frequency. In contrast,
coatings made of delaminated few-layer MXene are not as effective as their
multi-layer counterparts. Our high-resolution interface characterization by
transmission electron microscopy revealed unambiguous differences regarding the
uniformity and chemistry of the formed tribo-layers as well as the degree of
tribo-induced MXenes' exfoliation. Atomistic insights into the exfoliation
process and molecular dynamic simulations quantitatively backed up our
experimental results regarding coating thickness and velocity dependency. This
ultimately demonstrates that MXenes' tribological performance is governed by
the underlying tribo-chemistry and their exfoliation ability during rubbing.

<h3>Berry-Curvature Engineering for Nonreciprocal Directional Dichroism in  Two-Dimensional Antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02998" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02998</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In two-dimensional antiferromagnets, we identify the mixed Berry curvature as
the geometrical origin of the nonreciprocal directional dichroism (NDD), which
refers to the difference in light absorption with the propagation direction
flipped. Such a Berry curvature is strongly tied to the uniaxial strain in
accordance with the symmetry constraint, leading to a highly tunable NDD, whose
sign and magnitude can be manipulated via the strain direction. As a concrete
example, we demonstrate such a phenomenon in a lattice model of MnBi2Te4. The
coupling between the mixed Berry curvature and strain also suggests the
magnetic quadrupole of the Bloch wave packet as the macroscopic order parameter
probed by the NDD in two dimensions, distinct from the multiferroic order P
times M or the spin toroidal and quadrupole order within a unit cell in
previous studies. Our work paves the way of the Berry-curvature engineering for
optical nonreciprocity in two-dimensional antiferromagnets.

<h3>Stockmayer supracolloidal magnetic polymers under the influence of an  applied magnetic field and a shear flow</h3>

<br>
<br>
The idea of creating magnetically controllable colloids whose rheological
properties can be finely tuned on the nano- or micro-scale has caused a lot of
experimental and theoretical effort. The latter resulted in systems whose
building blocks are ranging between single magnetic nanoparticles to complexes
of such nanoparticles bound together by various mechanisms. The binding can be
either chemical or physical, reversible or not. One way to create a system that
is physically bound is to let the precrosslinked supracolloidal magnetic
polymers (SMPs) to cluster due to both magnetic and Van-der-Waals-type forces.
The topology of the SMPs in this case can be used to tune both magnetic and
rheological properties of the resulting clusters as we show in this work. We
employ Molecular Dynamics computer simulations coupled with explicit solvent
modelled by Lattice-Boltzmann method in order to model the behaviour of the
clusters formed by chains, rings, X- and Y-shaped SMPs in a shear flow with
externally applied magnetic field. We find that the shear stabilises the shape
of the clusters not letting them extend in the direction of the field and
disintegrate. The clusters that show the highest response to an applied field
and higher shape stability are those made of Y- and X-like SMPs.

<h3>Controllable odd-frequency Cooper pairs in multi-superconductor  Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>Jorge Cayao, Pablo Burset, Yukio Tanaka</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors with
distinct phases and explore the formation of nonlocal or inter-superconductor
pair correlations. We find that the multiple superconductor nature offers an
additional degree of freedom that broadens the classification of pair
symmetries, enabling nonlocal even- and odd-frequency pairings that can be
highly controlled by the superconducting phases and the energy of the
superconductors. Specially, when the phase difference between two
superconductors is $\pi$, their associated nonlocal odd-frequency pairing is
the only type of inter-superconductor pair correlations. Finally, we show that
these nonlocal odd-frequency Cooper pairs dominate the nonlocal conductance via
crossed Andreev reflections, which constitutes a direct evidence of
odd-frequency pairing.

<h3>Hubbard parameters for programmable tweezer arrays</h3>

The experimental realization of Fermi-Hubbard tweezer arrays opens a new
stage for engineering fermionic matter, where programmable lattice geometries
and Hubbard model parameters are combined with single-site imaging. In order to
use these versatile experimental Fermi-Hubbard models as quantum simulators, it
is crucial to know the Hubbard parameters describing them. Here we develop
methods to calculate the Hubbard model parameters of arbitrary two-dimensional
lattice geometries: the tunneling $t$, on-site potential $V$, and interaction
$U$, for multiple bands and for both fermions and bosons. We show several
examples. One notable finding is that equally deep and separated tweezers
actually give spatially non-uniform Hubbard parameters, and we demonstrate
procedures to find trap configurations that equalize these parameters. More
generally, these procedures solve the inverse problem of calculating Hubbard
parameters: given desired Hubbard parameters, find trap configurations to
realize them. These methods will be critical tools for using tunnel-coupled
tweezer arrays.

<h3>Extraordinary Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Tunnel  Junctions with Antiperovskite Electrodes</h3>

Recent theoretical predictions and experimental demonstrations of a large
tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in antiferromagnetic (AFM) tunnel
junctions (AFMTJs) offer a new paradigm for information technologies where the
AFM N\`eel vector serves as a state variable. A large TMR is beneficial for the
applications. Here, we predict the emergence of an extraordinary TMR (ETMR)
effect in AFMTJs utilizing noncollinear AFM antiperovskite XNMn$_{3}$ (X = Ga,
Sn,...) electrodes and a perovskite oxide ATiO$_{3}$ (A = Sr, Ba,...) barrier
layer. The ETMR effect stems from the perfectly spin-polarized electronic
states in the AFM antiperovskites that can efficiently tunnel through the
low-decay-rate evanescent states of the perovskite oxide while preserving their
spin state. Using an GaNMn$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$/GaNMn$_{3}$ (001) AFMTJ as a
representative example, we demonstrate a giant TMR ratio exceeding $10^{4}$%
and originating from the ETMR effect. These results are promising for the
efficient detection and control of the N\`eel vector in AFM spintronics.

<h3>Magnetic field-induced partially polarized chiral spin liquid in a  transition-metal dichalcogenide Moiré system</h3>

<br>
<br>
As one of the most intriguing states of matter, the chiral spin liquid (CSL)
has attracted much scientific interest. On one hand, its existence and
mechanism in crystalline strongly correlated systems remain hotly debated. On
the other hand, strong correlation driven emergent phenomena can be realized in
twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers with a tremendously tunable
large length scale providing a new platform for the emergence of CSLs. We focus
on a strongly correlated model relevant to heterobilayer
$\textrm{WSe}_{2}/\textrm{MoSe}_{2}$ and investigate the Mott insulating phase
at half filling under an out-of-plane magnetic field. Considering both its
orbital and spin Zeeman effects we identify three conventionally ordered phases
including a $120^{\circ}$ Ne\'{e}l phase, a stripe phase and an up-up-down
phase. For intermediate fields an emergent quantum spin liquid phase is
identified with partial spin polarization. We further characterize the
topological nature of the quantum spin liquid as the $\nu$ = 1/2 Laughlin
chiral spin liquid through the topological entanglement spectrum and quantized
spin pumping under spin flux insertion. In addition, we map out the quantum
phase diagram for different twisted angles in an experimentally accessible
parameter regime.
