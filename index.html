<h3>Adhesive Release via Elasto-Osmotic Stress Driven Surface Instability</h3>

Recent studies demonstrated that an elastomer containing hygroscopic
inclusions absorbs moisture and swell. Here we show that a thin film of such an
elastomer bonded to a rigid substrate undergoes morphological instability upon
absorption of water, the wavelength of which increases linearly with its
thickness. As the driving force for such a morphological instability arises
from the difference of the chemical potential of water between its source and
that in the film, its development is slowed down as the salinity of the water
increases. Nonetheless, the wavelength of the fully developed morphology, but
not its amplitude, is independent of the salinity. We also demonstrate that if
a domed disk shaped adherent is attached to the hygro-elastomeric film before
moisture absorption, the elastic force generated during the morphological
transition is able to dislodge it completely without the need of any external
force. These patterns, once developed in pure water, is subdued when the
salinity of water increases or if it is exposed to dry air. They re-emerge when
the film is immersed in water again. Such an active response could be important
in fouling release when a ship coated with such a hygro-elastomer changes its
location during its long travel through sea, where salinity varies from place
to place.

<h3>Spontaneous Emulsification: Elucidation of the Local Processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11442" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11442</a>
<br>

Micro and/or Nano sized emulsions are formed when an organic liquid gently
comes in contact with water in the presence of a surfactant, where no external
agitation is required. Many years of research made it clear that the driving
force for spontaneous emulsification arises from the differences of the
chemical potentials of various components in the organic and aqueous phases,
which triggers diffusion coupled hydrodynamic fluctuation. While extraordinary
theoretical developments have taken place that attempted to describe these
processes within the scopes of equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
the local processes underlying the spontaneous emulsification, however, still
remain elusive. In this research, we investigate the local processes that
involve the transfer of surfactant as well as water from one phase to another
(i.e. water to oil), which results in the formation of water-in-oil emulsion in
the organic phase and, subsequently. Thes emulsions invert into oil-in-water
emulsion, rather abruptly, as they cross the phase boundary. Studies based on
UV spectroscopy and molecular dynamics indicate that these processes may
involve explosive events and subsequent assembly of the fragments to other
organized structures which are reminiscent of cusp catastrophe proposed earlier
by Dickinson. These processes lead to either to a strong or a weak fluctuation
of the component concentrations below the interface that also becomes evident
in the fast (athermal) diffusion of the emulsion droplets from the interfacial
region farther into the bulk water. These events can be arrested suitably with
polymeric additives.

<h3>Hydrodynamics of an odd active surfer in a chiral fluid</h3>

We theoretically and computationally study the low-Reynolds-number
hydrodynamics of a linear active microswimmer surfing on a compressible thin
fluid layer characterized by an odd viscosity. In the limit of small odd
viscosity compared to the even viscosities of the fluid layer, we obtain
analytical expressions for the self-induced flow field, which includes
non-reciprocal components due to the odd viscosity. On this basis, we fully
analyze the behavior of a single linear swimmer, finding that it follows a
circular path, the radius of which is, to leading order, inversely proportional
to the magnitude of the odd viscosity. In addition, we show that a pair of
swimmers exhibits a wealth of two-body dynamics that depends on the initial
relative orientation angles as well as on the propulsion mechanism adopted by
each swimmer. In particular, the pusher-pusher and pusher-puller-type swimmer
pairs exhibit a generic spiral motion, while the puller-puller pair is found to
either co-rotate in the steady state along a circular trajectory or exhibit a
more complex chaotic behavior resulting from the interplay between hydrodynamic
and steric interactions. Our theoretical predictions may pave the way toward a
better understanding of active transport in active chiral fluids with odd
viscosity, and may find potential applications in the quantitative
microrheological characterization of odd-viscous fluids.

<h3>Effective one-band models for the 1D cuprate  Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+δ}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11905" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11905</a>
<br>
<i>Adrian E. Feiguin, Christian Helman, Armando A. Aligia</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a multiband Hubbard model $H_m$ for Cu and O orbitals in
Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ similar to the tree-band model for
two-dimensional (2D) cuprates. The hopping parameters are obtained from
maximally localized Wannier functions derived from \textit{ab initio}
calculations. Using the cell perturbation method, we derive both a generalized
$t-J$ model $H_{tJ}$ and a one-band Hubbard model $H_{H}$ to describe the
low-energy physics of the system. $H_{tJ}$ has the advantage of having a
smaller relevant Hilbert space, facilitating numerical calculations, while
additional terms should be included in $H_{H}$ to accurately describe the
multi-band physics of $H_m$. Using $H_{tJ}$ and DMRG, we calculate the
wave-vector resolved photoemission and discuss the relevant features in
comparison with recent experiments. In agreement with previous calculations, we
find that the addition of an attractive nearest-neighbor interaction of the
order of the nearest-neighbor hopping shifts weight from the $3 k_F$ to the
holon-folding branch. Kinetic effects also contribute to this process.

<h3>Force Dipole Interactions in Tubular Fluid Membranes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12061</a>
<br>
<i>Samyak Jain, Rickmoy Samanta</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct viscous fluid flow sourced by a force dipole embedded in a
cylindrical fluid membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. We find
analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin
tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics
of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a
mutually perpendicular dipole pair generically move together along helical
geodesics. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational
symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and
transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic
hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from
flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact
direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the
angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this
feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially
situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact
angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the
dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for
non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in
nature, as well as in-vitro experiments (25).

<h3>Modulation of skyrmionic magnetic textures in two-dimensional vdW  materials and their heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11335" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11335</a>

<i>Xiaoyan Yao, Di Hu, Shuai Dong</i>

The intrinsic magnetism observed in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW)
materials provides a unique opportunity for exploring the 2D topological
magnetic textures, in particular skyrmionic magnetic textures (SMTs) including
skyrmion and its topological equivalents. Since the experimental discovery of
skyrmions in the 2D vdW materials and their heterostructures, a critical
challenge lies in the control of these SMTs to translate their intriguing
features into spintronic applications. Here, we review the recent experimental
and theoretical progresses on the modulations of SMTs in 2D vdW monolayer
materials and their heterostructures. Besides well-established basic modulation
factors including temperature, magnetic field and sample thickness, we present
the experimental realization of mobility and transition driven by electric
current, and the theoretical prediction of diverse magnetoelectric modulations
by electric field. Considering the 2D character of vdW layered materials,
strain and stacking style are also efficient approaches to tune the magnetic
textures.

<h3>Superconductivity in Monolayer WTe$_2$ from repulsive interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11345" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11345</a>
<br>
<i>Ammar Jahin, Yuxuan Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconductivity has been experimentally observed in monolayer WTe2, which
in-plane field measurements suggested are of spin-triplet nature. Furthermore,
it has been proposed that with a $p$-wave pairing, the material is a
second-order topological superconductor with a pair of Majorana zero modes at
the corners of a finite sample. We show that for a repulsive on-site
interaction and sizable Fermi surfaces, the desired p-wave state arises
naturally due to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, and indeed a finite
superconducting sample hosts corner Majorana zero modes. We study the behavior
of the critical temperature in response to external in-plane magnetic fields.
We find an enhancement to the critical temperature that depends on the
direction of the magnetic field, which can be directly verified experimentally.

<h3>Ultraconfined plasmons in atomically thin crystalline silver  nanostructures</h3>

<br>
The ability to confine light down to atomic scales is critical for the
development of applications in optoelectronics and optical sensing as well as
for the exploration of nanoscale quantum phenomena. Plasmons in metallic
nanostructures can achieve this type of confinement, although fabrication
imperfections down to the subnanometer scale hinder actual developments. Here,
we demonstrate narrow plasmons in atomically thin crystalline silver
nanostructures fabricated by prepatterning silicon substrates and epitaxially
depositing silver films of just a few atomic layers in thickness. Combined with
on-demand lateral shaping, this procedure allows for an unprecedented control
over optical field confinement in the near-infrared spectral region.
Specifically, we observe fundamental and higher-order plasmons featuring
extreme spatial confinement and high-quality factors that reflect the
crystallinity of the metal. Our approach holds potential for the design and
exploitation of atomic-scale nanoplasmonic devices in optoelectronics, sensing,
and quantum-physics applications.

<h3>Impact of clustering of substitutional impurities on quasiparticle  lifetimes and localization</h3>

<br>
<i>Jack G. Nedell, Michael Vogl, Gregory A. Fiete</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the observation and prediction of clustering behavior for
impurities substituted into the host lattice of a real material, and the
dramatic impact this can have on electronic properties, we develop a simple
approach to describe such an effect via the electron self-energy. We employ a
disorder averaged T-matrix expansion taken to second order, which we modify to
include a clustering probability parameter. This approach circumvents the need
for specific cluster probability distributions, simplifying greatly the
analysis of clustered impurities. To gain analytical insights, we study a
nearest-neighbor square lattice tight-binding Hamiltonian with clustered
impurity substitutions to investigate clustering of off-diagonal hopping
impurities. We find that our T-matrix approach is in excellent agreement with
exact numerical results from a tight-binding computation performed with the
KWANT package. We observe a variety of interesting impurity clustering-induced
effects in the self-energy such as the suppression of quasi-particle lifetimes
at certain momenta and an increase in localization, as indicated by the inverse
participation ratio. The KWANT results are reproduced in our modified T-matrix
approach. In addition, our method allows for a full analytical treatment of
clustering effects which can aid in physical insight.

<h3>NiSi: New venue for antiferromagnetic spintronics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Envisaging antiferromagnetic spintronics pivots on two key criteria of high
transition temperature and tuning of underlying magnetic order using
straightforward application of magnetic field or electric current. Here, we
show that NiSi metal can provide suitable new platform in this quest. First,
our study unveils high temperature antiferromagnetism in single crystal NiSi
with $T_{N} \geq 700$ K. Antiferromagnetic order in NiSi is accompanied by the
non-centrosymmetric magnetic character with small ferromagnetic component in
a-c plane. Second, we find that NiSi manifests distinct magnetic and electronic
hysteresis responses to field applications due to the disparity in two moment
directions. While magnetic hysteresis is characterized by one-step switching
between ferromagnetic states of uncompensated moment, electronic behavior is
ascribed to metamagnetic switching phenomena between non-collinear spin
configurations. Importantly, the switching behaviors persist to high
temperature. The properties underscore the importance of NiSi in the pursuit of
antiferromagnetic spintronics.

<h3>Closed vortex state in 3D mesoscopic superconducting films under an  applied transport current</h3>

<i>Leonardo Rodrigues Cadorim, Lucas Veneziani de Toledo, Wilson Aires Ortiz, Jorge Berger, Edson Sardella</i>
<br>
<br>
By using the full 3D generalized time dependent Ginzbug-Landau equation we
study a long superconducting film of finite width and thickness under an
applied transport current. We show that, for sufficiently large thickness, the
vortices and the antivortices become curved before they annihilate each other.
As they approach the center of the sample, their ends combine, producing a
single closed vortex. We also determine the critical values of the thickness
for which the closed vortex sets in for different values of the Ginzburg-Ladau
parameter. Finally, we propose a model of how to detect a closed vortex
experimentally.

<h3>Bias sputtering of granular $\text{L1}_0$-FePt films with hexagonal  boron nitride grain boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11411" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11411</a>
<br>
<i>Chengchao Xu, B.S.D.Ch.S Varaprasad, David E. Laughlin, Jian-Gang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we present an experimental study of $\text{L1}_0$-FePt
granular films with crystalline/amorphous boron nitride (BN) grain boundary
materials for heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). It is found that an
adequate RF substrate bias yields the formation of hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) nanosheets in grain boundaries, facilitating the columnar growth of FePt
grains during sputtering at high temperatures. The h-BN monolayers conform to
the side surfaces of columnar FePt grains, completely encircling individual
FePt grains. The resulting core-shell FePt/h-BN nanostructures appear to be
highly promising for HAMR application. The high thermal stability of h-BN grain
boundaries allows the deposition temperature to be as high as 800oC such that
high order parameters of FePt $\text{L1}_0$ phase have been obtained. For the
fabricated FePt/h-BN thin film, excellent granular microstructure with FePt
grains of 6.5nm in diameter and 11.5nm in height has been achieved along with
good magnetic hysteresis properties.

<h3>Hyperfine interactions in open-shell planar $sp^2$-carbon nanostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11422" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11422</a>
<br>
<i>Sanghita Sengupta, Thomas Frederiksen, Geza Giedke</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate hyperfine interaction (HFI) using density-functional theory
for several open-shell planar $sp^2$-carbon nanostructures displaying $\pi$
magnetism. Our prototype structures include both benzenoid ([$n$]triangulenes
and a graphene nanoribbon) as well as non-benzenoid (indene, fluorene, and
indene[2,1-b]fluorene) molecules. Our results obtained with ORCA indicate that
isotropic Fermi contact and anisotropic dipolar terms contribute in comparable
strength, rendering the HFI markedly anisotropic. We find that the magnitude of
HFI in these molecules can reach more than 100 MHz, thereby opening up the
possibility of experimental detection via methods such as electron spin
resonance-scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). Additionally, we use
empirical models based on $\pi$-spin polarization at carbon sites to provide
generic $sp^2$ HFI fit parameters for these classes of molecules using methods
such as ORCA, SIESTA and mean-field Hubbard (MFH) models that successfully
describe the Fermi contact and dipolar contributions for $^{13}$C and $^{1}$H
nuclei. These fit parameters allow to obtain hyperfine tensors for large
systems where existing methodology is not suitable or computationally too
expensive. As an example, we show how HFI scales with system size in
[$n$]triangulenes for large $n$ using MFH. We also discuss some implications of
HFI for electron-spin decoherence and for coherent nuclear dynamics.

<h3>Charge Dynamics in Complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11432</a>
<br>
<i>Rishabh Jha, Jan C. Louw</i>
<br>
<br>
It is known that the large-$q$ Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) dot thermalizes under
rather general dynamical protocols. We consider a chain of such dots coupled
together, allowing for $r/2$ body hopping of particles between the nearest
neighbors. We develop a rather general analytical framework for this setup and
present the methodology as well as the results required to study the dynamics
of such a chain. This allows one to study general dynamical protocols such as
quenches and ramps. We find that to leading order in $1/q$, the physics of the
diffusive case $r>2$ is effectively the same as the kinetic case $r=2$,
assuming $r=\mathcal{O}(q^0)$. Given a quench from a disconnected to a
connected chain, we obtain a discrete wave equation for charge transport at
leading order in $1/q$. Analytically this yields a slow charge transport, which
would only change significantly over times scales of the order $q$. In
contrast, the Green's function change over a time scale $q^0$. As such, in the
limit $q\rightarrow \infty$, effectively the local charge density becomes
constant. Moreover, we give a general proof by contradiction showing that this
chain does not instantaneously thermalize and comment on the various limits
where it possibly can.

<h3>Wrinkling composite sheets</h3>

<br>
<i>Marc Suñé, Cristóbal Arratia, A. F. Bonfils, Dominic Vella, J. S. Wettlaufer</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the buckling shape and critical compression of confined
inhomogeneous composite sheets lying on a liquid foundation. The buckling modes
are controlled by the bending stiffness of the sheet, the density of the
substrate, and the size and the spatially dependent elastic coefficients of the
sheet. We solve the (linearized) F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an equations describing
the mechanical equilibrium of a sheet when its bending stiffness varies
parallel to the direction of confinement. The case of a homogeneous bending
stiffness exhibits a degeneracy of wrinkled states for certain sizes of the
confined sheet. This degeneracy disappears for spatially dependent elastic
coefficients. Medium length sheets buckle similarly to their homogeneous
counterparts, whereas the wrinkled states in large length sheets localize the
bending energy towards the soft regions of the sheet.

<h3>Magnetic and singlet phases in the three-dimensional periodic Anderson  Model</h3>

Heavy fermion materials are compounds in which localized $f$-orbitals
hybridize with delocalized $d$ ones, leading to quasiparticles with large
renormalized masses. The presence of strongly correlated $f$-electrons at the
Fermi level may also lead to long-range order, such as magnetism, or
unconventional superconductivity. From a theoretical point of view, the
``standard model'' for heavy fermion compounds is the Periodic Anderson Model
(PAM). Despite being extensively scrutinized, its thermodynamic properties in
three-dimensional lattices have not been carefully addressed by unbiased
methodologies. Here we investigate the 3D PAM employing state-of-the-art finite
temperature auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We present the
behavior of the kinetic energy, the entropy, the specific heat, and the double
occupancy as functions of the temperature and the hybridization strength. From
these quantities, and by the analysis of the spin-spin correlation functions,
we investigate the occurrence of magnetic phase transitions at finite
temperatures, and determine the phase diagram of the model, including the
behavior of the N\'eel temperature as a function of the external parameters.

<h3>Topological monopole's gauge field induced anomalous Hall effect in  artificial honeycomb lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11506</a>

<br>
<br>
Vortex magnetic structure in artificial honeycomb lattice provides a unique
platform to explore emergent properties due to the additional Berry phase
curvature imparted by chiral magnetization to circulating electrons via direct
interaction. We argue that while the perpendicularly-aligned magnetic component
leads to the quantized flux of monopole at the center of the Berry sphere, the
in-plane vortex circulation of magnetization gives rise to unexpected
non-trivial topological Berry phase due to the gauge field transformation. The
unprecedented effect signifies the importance of vector potential in
multiply-connected geometrical systems. Experimental confirmations to proposed
hypotheses are obtained from Hall resistance measurements on permalloy
honeycomb lattice. Investigation of the topological gauge transformation due to
the in-plane chirality reveals anomalous quasi-oscillatory behavior in Hall
resistance $R_{xy}$ as function of perpendicular field. The oscillatory nature
of $R_{xy}$ is owed to the fluctuation in equilibrium current as a function of
Fermi wave-vector $k_F$, envisaged under the proposed new formulation in this
article. Our synergistic approach suggests that artificially tunable
nanostructured material provides new vista to the exploration of topological
phenomena of strong fundamental importance.

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with conventional bulk ferromagnets
separated by a nonmagnetic insulating layer are key building blocks in
spintronics for magnetic sensors and memory. A radically different approach of
using atomically-thin van der Waals (vdW) materials in MTJs is expected to
boost their figure of merit, the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), while
relaxing the lattice-matching requirements from the epitaxial growth and
supporting high-quality integration of dissimilar materials with
atomically-sharp interfaces. We report TMR up to 192% at 10 K in all-vdW
Fe3GeTe2/GaSe/Fe3GeTe2 MTJs. Remarkably, instead of the usual insulating
spacer, this large TMR is realized with a vdW semiconductor GaSe. Integration
of two-dimensional ferromagnets in semiconductor-based vdW junctions offers
gate-tunability, bias dependence, magnetic proximity effects, and
spin-dependent optical-selection rules. We demonstrate that not just the
magnitude, but also the TMR sign is tuned by the applied bias or the
semiconductor thickness, enabling modulation of highly spin-polarized carriers
in vdW semiconductors.

The second magnetization peak (SMP) appears in most superconductors and is
crucial for the understanding of vortex physics as well as the application.
Although it is well known that the SMP is related to the type and quantity of
disorder/defects, the mechanism has not been universally understood. In this
work, we selected three stoichiometric superconducting
RbCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ single crystals with identical superconducting
critical temperature $T_c$ $\sim$ 31 K and similar self-field critical current
density $J_c$, but with different amounts of disorder/defects, to study the SMP
effect. It is found that only the sample S2 with a moderate disorder/defects
shows a significant SMP effect. The evolution of the normalized pinning force
density $f_p$ demonstrates that the dominant pinning mechanism changes from
weak pinning at low temperatures to strong pinning at high temperatures. The
microstructure study for sample S2 reveals some expanded Ca$_2$F$_2$ layers and
dislocation defects in RbFe$_2$As$_2$ layers. The normalized magnetic
relaxation results indicate that the SMP is strongly associated with the
elastic to plastic (E-P) vortex transition. As temperature increases, the SMP
gradually evolves into a step-like shape and then becomes a sharp peak near the
irreversibility field similar to what is usually observed in low-temperature
superconductors. Our findings connect the low field SMP of high-temperature
superconductors and the high field peak of low-temperature superconductors,
revealing the possible universal origin related to the E-P phase transition.

Although many years have passed since the discovery of
high-critical-temperature (high-$T_c$) superconducting materials, the
underlying mechanism is still unknown. The B1g phonon anomaly in high-Tc
cuprate superconductors has long been studied; however, the correlation between
the B1g phonon anomaly and superconductivity has yet to be clarified. In the
present study, we successfully reproduced the B1g phonon anomaly in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) using an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulation and temperature-dependent effective potential (TDEP) method. The Ag
phonon by Ba atoms shows a more severe anomaly than the B1g phonon at low
temperatures. Our analysis of the phonon anomaly and the temperature-dependent
phonon dispersion indicated that decoupling between thermal phenomena and
electron transport at low temperatures leads to layer-by-layer thermal
decoupling in YBCO. Electronically and thermally isolated Ba atoms in YBCO are
responsible for the thermal decoupling. The analytic study of the thermal
dcoupling revealed that Planckian dissipation expressing linear-T resistivity
is another expression of the Fermi liquid of the CuO$_2$ plane. The Uemura plot
of the relationship between Tc and the Fermi temperature, as well as the
superconducting dome in YBCO, is explained rigorously and quantitatively. Our
findings not only present a new paradigm for understanding high-Tc
superconductivity but also imply that the spontaneous formation of
low-temperature layers in materials can lead to revolutionary changes in the
thermal issues of industrial fields.

<br>
<br>
Superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and critical current density (Jc)
are two key factors that are not only crucial for probing high-temperature
superconducting mechanisms, but also for practical applications. The simple
crystal structure of FeSe is very favorable for the fabrication of thin films
and wires, but its application is limited by the relatively low Tc and small
Jc. A previous study has found that the Tc of FeSe can be significantly
enhanced over 40 K by using the protonation method. Here, we present a
systematic study of Jc and vortex properties of H+-intercalated FeSe (Hx-FeSe)
single crystals. The value of Jc for Hx-FeSe single crystal is significantly
enhanced, exceeding 1.3*10^6 A/cm2 at 4 K, which is more than two orders of
magnitude larger than 1.1*10^4 A/cm2 of pristine FeSe. The vortex pinning
mechanism of Hx-FeSe is found to be surface pinning, which is different from
the dominant strong point-like pinning in pristine FeSe. Moreover, the
systematic study of the vortex phase transition and the underlying mechanism
provides a wealth of information for the vortex phase diagram of Hx-FeSe single
crystal. Our results confirm that the introduction of H+ intercalations into
FeSe not only enhances the Tc, but also significantly increases the value of
Jc, which is favorable for practical applications.

<br>
<br>
We have studied the magnetic properties of pressure-induced ferromagnet
Ca2RuO4 to reveal the uniqueness of the 4d-electron ferromagnetism in the
quasi-two-dimensional conductor. The magnetic parameters have been estimated
from the paramagnetic susceptibility and the magnetisation process under
pressure up to 2 GPa. The parameters can well be interpreted on the basis of
the self-consistent renormalization theory of spin fluctuation for 3D-itinerant
ferromagnet. Nevertheless, the metallic Ca2RuO4 shows quite strong anisotropy
not only in the conductivity but also in the magnetisation process. Such the
strong anisotropy is rare for an itinerant ferromagnet and is a unique
characteristic of the 4d electron system Ca2RuO4.

<h3>Differentiated roles of Lifshitz transition on thermodynamics and  superconductivity in La2-xSrxCuO4</h3>

<br>
<br>
The effect of Lifshitz transition on thermodynamics and superconductivity in
hole-doped cuprates has been heavily debated but remains an open question. In
particular, an observed peak of electronic specific heat is proposed to
originate from fluctuations of a putative quantum critical point p* (e.g. the
termination of pseudogap at zero temperature), which is close to, but
distinguishable from the Lifshitz transition in La-based cuprates. Here, we
report an in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of
three-dimensional Fermi surfaces in La2-xSrxCuO4 thin films(x = 0.06 - 0.35).
With accurate kz dispersion quantification, the Lifshitz transition is
determined to happen within a finite range around x = 0.21. Normal state
electronic specific heat, calculated from spectroscopy-derived band parameters,
agrees with previous thermodynamic microcalorimetry measurements. The account
of the specific heat maximum by underlying band structures excludes the need
for additionally dominant contribution from the quantum fluctuations at p*. A
d-wave superconducting gap smoothly across the Lifshitz transition demonstrates
the insensitivity of superconductivity to the dramatic density of states
enhancement.

${\gamma}$-GeSe is a new type of layered bulk material that was recently
successfully synthesized. By means of density functional theory
first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the physical
properties of two dimensional (2D) few-layer ${\gamma}$-GeSe. It is found that
few-layer ${\gamma}$-GeSe are semiconductors with band gaps decreasing with
increasing layer number; and 2D ${\gamma}$-GeSe with layer number n ${\ge}$ 2
are ferroelectric with rather low transition barriers, consistent with the
sliding ferroelectric mechanism. Particularly, Zeeman-type spin splitting is
observed at the top of valence band, which can be switched by the ferroelectric
reversal; furthermore, their negative piezoelectricity also enables the
regulation of spin splitting by strain. Finally, high carrier mobility and
excellent optical absorption were also revealed. These intriguing properties
make 2D few-layer ${\gamma}$-GeSe be promising in spintronic and optoelectric
applications.

Using a comprehensive structure search and high-throughput first-principles
calculations of 1483 compounds, this study presents the phase diagram of
Lu-H-N. The formation energy landscape of Lu-H-N was derived and utilized to
assess the thermodynamic stability of compounds. Results indicate that there
are no stable Lu-H-N ternary structures in this system, but metastable ternary
structures, such as Lu20H2N17 (C2/m), Lu2H2N (P3-m1), were observed with small
Ehull (< 100 meV/atom). Moreover, applying hydrostatic pressure up to 10 GPa
causes the energy convex hull of the Lu-H-N to shift its shape and stabilizes
binary phases such as LuN9 and Lu10H21. Additionally, interstitial empty sites
in LuH2 were noted, which may explain the formation of Lu10H21 and LuH3-xNy. To
provide a basis for comparison, X-ray diffraction patterns and electronic
structures of some compounds are also presented.

<h3>Intrinsic Magnon Orbital Hall Effect in Honeycomb Antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11687" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11687</a>
<br>
<i>Gyungchoon Go, Daehyeon An, Hyun-Woo Lee, Se Kwon Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the transport of magnon orbitals in a honeycomb
antiferromagnet. We find that the magnon orbital Berry curvature is finite even
without spin-orbit coupling and thus the resultant magnon orbital Hall effect
is an intrinsic property of the honeycomb antiferromagnet rooted only in the
exchange interaction and the lattice structure. Due to the intrinsic nature of
the magnon orbital Hall effect, the magnon orbital Nernst conductivity is
estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than the predicted values of the
magnon spin Nernst conductivity that requires finite spin-orbit coupling. For
the experimental detection of the predicted magnon orbital Hall effect, we
invoke the magnetoelectric effect that couples the magnon orbital and the
electric polarization, which allows us to detect the magnon orbital
accumulation through the local voltage measurement. Our results pave a way for
a deeper understanding of the topological transport of the magnon orbitals and
also its utilization for low-power magnon-based orbitronics, namely magnon
orbitronics.

<h3>Helitronics for classical and unconventional computing</h3>

Magnetic textures are promising candidates for unconventional computing due
to their non-linear dynamics. We propose to investigate the rich variety of
seemingly trivial lamellar magnetic phases, e.g., helical, spiral, stripy
phase, or other one-dimensional soliton lattices. These are the natural stray
field-free ground states of almost every magnet. The order parameters of these
phases may be of potential interest for both classical and unconventional
computing, which we refer to as helitronics. For the particular case of a
chiral magnet and its helical phase, we use micromagnetic simulations to
demonstrate the working principles of all-electrical (i) classical binary
memory cells and (ii) memristor and neuron cells, based on the orientation of
the helical stripes.

<h3>Neural networks trained on synthetically generated crystals can extract  structural information from ICSD powder X-ray diffractograms</h3>

<br>
<i>Henrik Schopmans, Patrick Reiser, Pascal Friederich</i>
<br>
<br>
Machine learning techniques have successfully been used to extract structural
information such as the crystal space group from powder X-ray diffractograms.
However, training directly on simulated diffractograms from databases such as
the ICSD is challenging due to its limited size, class-inhomogeneity, and bias
toward certain structure types. We propose an alternative approach of
generating synthetic crystals with random coordinates by using the symmetry
operations of each space group. Based on this approach, we demonstrate online
training of deep ResNet-like models on up to a few million unique on-the-fly
generated synthetic diffractograms per hour. For our chosen task of space group
classification, we achieved a test accuracy of 79.9% on unseen ICSD structure
types from most space groups. This surpasses the 56.1% accuracy of the current
state-of-the-art approach of training on ICSD crystals directly. Our results
demonstrate that synthetically generated crystals can be used to extract
structural information from ICSD powder diffractograms, which makes it possible
to apply very large state-of-the-art machine learning models in the area of
powder X-ray diffraction. We further show first steps toward applying our
methodology to experimental data, where automated XRD data analysis is crucial,
especially in high-throughput settings. While we focused on the prediction of
the space group, our approach has the potential to be extended to related tasks
in the future.

<h3>Inducing or suppressing the anisotropy in multilayers based on CoFeB</h3>

<br>
<br>
Controlling the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is of practical interest to a
wide variety of applications. We study Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ single films
grown on various crystalline orientations of LiNbO$_3$ substrates and on
oxidized silicon. We identify the annealing conditions that are appropriate to
induce or suppress uniaxial anisotropy. Anisotropy fields can be increased by
annealing up to 11 mT when using substrates with anisotropic surfaces. They can
be decreased to below 1 mT when using isotropic surfaces. In the first case,
the observed increase of the anisotropy originates from the biaxial strain in
the film caused by the anisotropic thermal contraction of the substrate when
back at room temperature after strain relaxation during annealing. In the
second case, anisotropy is progressively removed by applying successive
orthogonal fields that are assumed to progressively suppress any chemical
ordering within the magnetic film. The method can be applied to CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB
synthetic antiferromagnets but the tuning of the anisotropy comes with a
decrease of the interlayer exchange coupling and a drastic change of the
exchange stiffness.

<h3>Robust microphase separation through chemical reaction networks</h3>

The interaction of phase-separating systems with chemical reactions is of
great interest in various contexts, from biology to material science. In
biology, phase separation is thought to be the driving force behind the
formation of biomolecular condensates, i.e. organelles without a membrane that
are associated with cellular metabolism, stress response, and development. RNA,
proteins, and small molecules participating in the formation of condensates are
also involved in a variety of biochemical reactions: how do the chemical
reaction dynamics influence the process of phase separation? Here we are
interested in finding chemical reactions that can arrest the growth of
condensates, generating stable spatial patterns of finite size (microphase
separation), in contrast with the otherwise spontaneous (unstable) growth of
condensates. We consider a classical continuum model for phase separation
coupled to a chemical reaction network (CRN), and we seek conditions for the
emergence of stable oscillations of the solution in space. Given reaction
dynamics with uncertain rate constants, but known structure, we derive easily
computable conditions to assess whether microphase separation is impossible,
possible for some parameter values, or robustly guaranteed for all parameter
values within given bounds. Our results establish a framework to evaluate which
classes of CRNs favor the emergence of condensates with finite size, a question
that is broadly relevant to understanding and engineering life.

We study angular momentum radiation from electrically-biased chiral single
molecular junctions using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. Using
single and double helical chains as examples, we make connections between the
ability of a chiral molecule to emit photons with angular momentum to the
geometrical factors of the molecule. We point out that the mechanism studied
here does not involve the magnetic dipole momentum. Rather, it relies on
inelastic transitions between scattering states originated from two electrodes
with different chiral properties and chemical potentials. Thus, the required
time-reversal symmetry breaking is provided by nonequilibrium electron
transport.

<h3>Hybrid Topological Superconductivity and Hinge Majorana Flat Band in  Type-II Dirac Semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Yue Xie, Zhijun Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Type-II Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have a distinct Fermi surface topology, which
allows them to host novel topological superconductivity (TSC) different from
type-I DSMs. By performing a low-energy analysis on a generic DSM model, we
introduce an inherited pairing through band hybridization, which describes the
second-order TSC. In a type-II DSM model, it is a two-dimensional~(2D)
first-order time-reversal invariant topological superconductor for the $k_z =
0/\pi$ slice, whereas for the $k_z$ slices other than 0 or $\pi$, they belong
to 2D second-order topological superconductors. Our analysis reveals a Majorana
flat band on the $z$-directed hinge of the type-II DSM, which penetrates
through the whole hinge Brillouin zone. These higher-order hinge modes are
protected by $C_{4v}$ symmetry and can even host strong stability against
finite $C_{4z}$ rotation symmetry-breaking order. We suggest that experimental
realization of these findings can be achieved in transition metal
dichalcogenides.

<h3>Kondo enhancement of current induced spin accumulation in a quantum dot</h3>

<br>
<br>
Weak spin-orbit coupling produces very limited current induced spin
accumulation in semiconductor nanostructures. We demonstrate a possibility to
increase parametrically the spin polarization using the Kondo effect. As a
model object we consider a quantum dot side coupled to a quantum wire taking
into account the spin dependent electron tunneling from the wire to the dot.
Using the nonequilibrium Green's functions, we show that the many body
correlations between the quantum dot and the quantum wire can increase the
current induced spin accumulation at low temperatures by almost two orders of
magnitude for the moderate system parameters. The enhancement is related to the
Kondo peak formation in the density of states and the spin instability due to
the strong Coulomb interaction. This effect may be useful to electrically
manipulate the localized electron spins in quantum dots for their quantum
applications.

<br>
<br>
The question of macroscopic occupation and spontaneous emergence of coherence
for exciton ensembles has gained renewed attention due to the rise of van der
Waals heterostructures made of atomically thin semiconductors. The hosted
interlayer excitons exhibit nanosecond lifetimes, long enough to allow for
excitonic thermalization in time. Several experimental studies reported
signatures of macroscopic occupation effects at elevated exciton densities.
With respect to theory, excitons are composite particles formed by fermionic
constituents, and a general theoretical argument for a bosonic thermalization
of an exciton gas beyond the linear regime is still missing. Here, we derive an
equation for the phonon mediated thermalization at densities above the
classical limit, and identify which conditions favor the thermalization of
fermionic or bosonic character, respectively. In cases where acoustic,
quasielastic phonon scattering dominates the dynamics, our theory suggests that
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) excitons might be bosonic enough to show
bosonic thermalization behaviour and decreasing dephasing for increasing
exciton densities. This can be interpreted as a signature of an emerging
coherence in the exciton ground state, and agrees well with the experimentally
observed features, such as a decreasing linewidth for increasing densities.

<br>
<br>
We studied magnetic states and phase transitions in the van der Waals
antiferromagnet VBr3 by specific heat and magnetization measurements of single
crystals in high magnetic fields and by ab initio density functional theory
calculations focused on exchange interactions. The magnetization behavior
resembles Ising antiferromagnets with magnetic moments kept in the out-of-plane
direction by strong uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The out-of-plane
magnetic field induces a spin-flip metamagnetic transition, which is of
first-order type at low temperatures while at higher temperatures the
transition becomes continuous. The first-order and continuous transition
segments in the field-temperature phase diagram meet at a tricritical point at
= 12 K. The magnetization response to the in-plane field manifests a continuous
spin-flop transition, which at 2 K terminates at a field mu0Hc = 27 T that can
serve as an estimate of the anisotropy field in VBr3. The magnetization curves
above the metamagnetic transition saturate at the same value of magnetic moment
musat = 1.2 muB/f.u., which is much smaller than the spin-only (S = 1) moment
of the V3+ ion. The reduced moment can be explained by the existence of a
significant orbital magnetic moment antiparallel to the spin. The orbital
moment is a key ingredient of a mechanism responsible for the observed large
anisotropy. The exact energy evaluation of possible magnetic orders
unambiguously shows that the magnetic ground state of VBr3 is the intralayer
zigzag antiferromagnetic order that renders the antiferromagnetic ground state
significantly more stable against the spin-flip transition than the other
options. The calculations also predict that a minimal distortion of the Br ion
sublattice causes a radical change of the orbital occupation in the ground
state, connected with the formation of the orbital moment and the stability of
magnetic order.

Exceptional points (EPs) of non-Hermitian (NH) systems have recently
attracted increasing attention due to their rich phenomenology and intriguing
applications. Compared to the predominantly studied second-order EPs,
higher-order EPs have been assumed to play a much less prominent role since
they generically require the tuning of more parameters. Here we experimentally
simulate two-dimensional topological NH band structures using single-photon
interferometry, and observe topologically stable third-order EPs obtained by
tuning only two real parameters in the presence of symmetry. Focusing on
two-dimensional NH system, we demonstrate on two types of third-order EPs,
respectively protected by parity-time symmetry and chiral symmetry, and
four-fold degeneracies, composed by the non-defective two-fold degeneracies and
second-order EPs. Our work reveals the abundant and conceptually richer
higher-order EPs protected by symmetries, and offers a versatile platform for
further research on topological NH systems.

We have designed a passive spintronic diode based on a single skyrmion
stabilized in a magnetic tunnel junction and studied its dynamics induced by
voltage-controlled anisotropy (VCMA) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(VDMI). We have demonstrated that the sensitivity (rectified voltage over input
microwave power) with realistic physical parameters and geometry can be larger
than 10 kV/W which is one order of magnitude better than diodes employing a
uniform ferromagnetic state. Our numerical and analytical results on the VCMA
and VDMI-driven resonant excitation of skyrmions beyond the linear regime
reveal a frequency dependence on the amplitude and no efficient parametric
resonance. Skyrmions with a smaller radius produced higher sensitivities,
demonstrating the efficient scalability of skyrmion-based spintronic diodes.
These results pave the way for designing passive ultra-sensitive and energy
efficient skyrmion-based microwave detectors.

<br>
In functionally graded materials (FGMs) fabricated using directed energy
deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM), cracks may form due to
interdendritic stress during solidification, the formation of intermetallics,
or the buildup of residual stresses. This study builds on our previously
proposed concept of three-alloy FGM system feasibility diagrams for the
identification of gradient pathways that avoid deleterious phases in FGMs by
also considering solidification cracking. Here, five solidification cracking
criteria were integrated into the feasibility diagrams, and equilibrium
simulations were carried out based on Scheil results (termed Scheil-equilibrium
simulation) to predict phase formation below the solidus temperature
considering solidification microsegregation. The new feasibility diagrams were
applied to four previously studied FGM systems, and the newly proposed approach
predicted high crack susceptibility, detrimental phase formation, or
interdendritic BCC phase formation in the experimentally observed cracking
region. This demonstrates the utility of the proposed framework for crack
prediction in the design of future FGMs gradient pathways.

Ultrafast charge separation after photoexcitation is a common phenomenon in
various van-der-Waals (vdW) heterostructures with great relevance for future
applications in light harvesting and detection. Theoretical understanding of
this phenomenon converges towards a coherent mechanism through charge transfer
states accompanied by energy dissipation into strongly coupled phonons. The
detailed microscopic pathways are material specific as they sensitively depend
on the band structures of the individual layers, the relative band alignment in
the heterostructure, the twist angle between the layers, and interlayer
interactions resulting in hybridization. We used time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy combined with tight binding and density functional
theory electronic structure calculations to investigate ultrafast charge
separation and recombination in WS2-graphene vdW heterostructures. We identify
several avoided crossings in the band structure and discuss their relevance for
ultrafast charge transfer. We relate our own observations to existing
theoretical models and propose a unified picture for ultrafast charge transfer
in vdW heterostructures where band alignment and twist angle emerge as the most
important control parameters.

We report the detailed analysis of temperature dependent neutron diffraction
pattern of the Cr$_2$CoAl inverse Heusler alloy and unveil the magnetic
structure up to the phase transition as well as its fully compensated
ferrimagnetic nature. The Rietveld refinement of the diffraction pattern using
the space group I$\bar4${\it m}2 confirm the inverse tetragonal structure over
the large temperature range from 100~K to 900~K. The refinement of the magnetic
phase considering the wave vector $k=$ (0, 0, 0) reveals the ferrimagnetic
nature of the sample below 730$\pm$5~K. This transition temperature is obtained
from empirical power law fitting of the variation in the ordered net magnetic
moment and intensity of (110) peak as a function of temperature. The spin
configuration of the microscopic magnetic structure suggests the nearly fully
compensated ferrimagnetic behavior where the magnetic moments of Cr2 are
antiparallel with respect to the Cr1, and Co moments. Moreover, the observed
anomaly in the thermal expansion and lattice parameters at 730$\pm$5~K suggest
that the distortion in crystal structure may play an important role in the
magnetic phase transition.

We study the time evolution of a single qubit when coupling to a bath, within
the framework of projection operator method. Employing the so-called modified
Redfield theory which also treats the energy conserving interaction
non-perturbatively, we are able to study the regime beyond the scope of the
usual approach. The reduced equations of motion for the qubit are derived in a
idealistic system where both the bath and the interactions are modeled by
Gaussian distributed random matrices. In strong decoherence regime, a simple
relation between the bath correlation function and decoherence process induced
by energy conserving interaction is found. It implies that energy conserving
interaction slows down the relaxation process, which leads to a zeno freezing
if it is sufficiently strong.Furthermore, our results are also confirmed in
numerical simulations.

The sesquioxide, Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$, has been a material of intense interest in
recent years due to reports of an anomalous giant magnetodielectric effect and
emergent mixed crystal field-phonon (vibronic) excitations below a putative
antiferromagnetic transition at T$_{N}$ = 6.2 K. The claim of long-range
magnetic order in this material is based on heat capacity and
temperature-dependent susceptibility measurements; however, multiple neutron
diffraction studies have been unable to distinguish any magnetic Bragg peaks.
In this article, we present the results of a comprehensive investigation of the
low-temperature phase in symmetry-broken polycrystalline Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$ using
a combination of magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, neutron diffraction,
triple-axis and time-of-flight (TOF) inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and
muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR). Our measurements and subsequent analysis confirm
that the transition at T$_{N}$ can be associated with the ordering of moments
on the Ce$^{3+}$ site. Both a spontaneous magnetic order observed with $\mu$SR
and a dispersive spin-wave spectrum observed with inelastic neutron scattering
suggest a model wherein planar dipoles order antiferromagnetically. Notable
inconsistencies between $\mu$SR and neutron scattering data within the dipole
picture provide strong evidence for the ordering of higher-order moments.

A single material achieving multiple topological phases can provide potential
application for topological spintronics, whereas the candidate materials are
very limited. Here, we report the structure, physical properties, and possible
emergence of multiple topological phases in the newly discovered, air-stable
EuCuBi single crystal. EuCuBi crystallizes in a hexagonal space group P63/mmc
(No. 194) in ZrBeSi-type structure with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state
below TN = 11.2 K. There is a competition between AFM and ferromagnetic (FM)
interactions below TN revealed by electrical resistivity and magnetic
susceptibility measurements. With the increasing magnetic field, EuCuBi evolves
from the AFM ground state with a small amount of FM component, going through
two possible metamagnetic phases, finally reaches the field-induced FM phase.
Based on the first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the Dirac,
Weyl, and possible mirror Chern insulator can be achieved in EuCuBi by tuning
the temperature and applying magnetic field, making EuCuBi a promising
candidate for exploring multiple topological phases.

Synthesis remains a challenge for advancing materials science. A key focus of
this challenge is how to enable selective synthesis, particularly as it
pertains to metastable materials. This perspective addresses the question: how
can ``spectator'' elements, such as those found in double ion exchange
(metathesis) reactions, enable selective materials synthesis? By observing
reaction pathways as they happen (\emph{in situ}) and calculating their
energetics using modern computational thermodynamics, we observe transient,
crystalline intermediates that suggest that many reactions attain a local
thermodynamic equilibrium dictated by local chemical potentials far before
achieving a global equilibrium set by the average composition. Using this
knowledge, one can thermodynamically ``shortcut'' unfavorable intermediates by
including additional elements beyond those of the desired target, providing
access to a greater number of intermediates with advantageous energetics and
selective phase nucleation. Ultimately, data-driven modeling that unites
first-principles approaches with experimental insights will refine the accuracy
of emerging predictive retrosynthetic models for complex materials synthesis.

In the framework of the theory of Dunkl-deformed bosons, Bose-Einstein
condensation of two and three-dimensional Dunkl-boson gases confined in the
one-dimensional gravitational field is investigated. Using the semi-classical
approximation method, we calculate the expressions of the Dunkl-critical
temperature $T_{c}^{D}$, the ground state population $\frac{N_{0}^{D}}{N}$ and
the Dunkl-mean energy and Dunkl-specific heat functions. Further numerical
calculation shows that the condensation temperature ratio
$\frac{T_{c}^{D}}{T_{c}^{B}}$ increases with the increasing Wigner parameter.

Nonreciprocal phenomena in the normal state are well established and key to
many commercial applications. In contrast, superconducting analogs, such as the
superconducting diode effect (SDE), are only starting to be experimentally
explored and pose significant challenges to their theoretical understanding. In
this work we put forth a phenomenological picture of the SDE based on the
generalized Ginzburg-Landau free energy, which includes a Lifshitz invariant as
the hallmark of noncentrosymmetric helical phase of the finite-momentum Cooper
pairs. We reveal that such a Lifshitz invariant drives the SDE in
quasi-two-dimensional systems in an applied magnetic field and cannot be
removed by a gauge transformation, due to the inherently inhomogeneous magnetic
response. For a thin film, the SDE scales with the square of its thickness and
nonlinearly with the strength of the in-plane magnetic field. We derive an
explicit formula that relates the SDE at small magnetic fields to the strength
of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, g-factor, and Fermi energy. For a
noncentrosymmetric Josephson junction, we self-consistently obtain generalized
anharmonic current-phase relation which support the SDE. The transparency of
our approach, which agrees well with experimentally-measured SDE, offers an
important method to study nonreciprocal phenomena, central to superconducting
spintronics and topological superconductivity.

In our previous work [R. Fantoni, Int. J. Mod. Phys. C, {\bf 29}, 1850064
(2018)] we studied, through a computer experiment, a one-component fermion
plasma on a sphere at finite, non-zero, temperature. We extracted thermodynamic
properties like the kinetic and internal energy per particle and structural
properties like the radial distribution function, and produced some snapshots
of the paths to study their shapes. Here we revisit such a study giving some
more theoretical details explaining the paths shape anisotropic conformation
due to the inhomogeneity in the polar angle of the variance of the random walk
diffusion from the kinetic action.

The Kondo effect, deriving from a local magnetic impurity mediating
electron-electron interactions, constitutes a flourishing basis for
understanding a large variety of intricate many-body problems. Its experimental
implementation in tunable circuits has made possible important advances through
well-controlled investigations. However, these have mostly concerned transport
properties, whereas thermodynamic observations - notably the fundamental
measurement of the spin of the Kondo impurity - remain elusive in test-bed
circuits. Here, with a novel combination of a "charge" Kondo circuit with a
charge sensor, we directly observe the state of the impurity and its
progressive screening. We establish the universal renormalization flow from a
single free spin to a screened singlet, the associated reduction in the
magnetization, and the relationship between scaling Kondo temperature and
microscopic parameters. In our device, a Kondo pseudospin is realized by two
degenerate charge states of a metallic island, which we measure with a
non-invasive, capacitively coupled charge sensor. Such pseudospin probe of an
engineered Kondo system opens the way to the thermodynamic investigation of
many exotic quantum states, including the clear observation of Majorana zero
modes through their fractional entropy.

We investigate, using experiments and numerical simulations, the distortions
and the alignment of skyrmions in the liquid crystal under external flows for a
range of average flow velocities. The simulations are based on the Landau-de
Gennes $Q$ tensor theory both for isolated as well as for systems with many
skyrmions. We found striking flow-driven elongation of an isolated skyrmion and
flow alignment of skyrmions in the many-skyrmion system, both of which are also
observed in the experiments. In the simulations, particular attention was given
to the dissipation rate and to the various dissipation channels for a single
skyrmion under external flow. This analysis provides insight on the observed
scaling regime of the elongation of isolated flowing skyrmions and revealed a
surprising plastic response at very short times, which may be relevant in
applications based on the alignment of soft structures such as liquid crystal
skyrmions.

This proceeding discusses the impact of XUV/X-ray irradiation on materials,
and how their response is affected by temperature, size, and structure. When
materials are exposed to intense XUV/X-ray irradiation, they undergo a series
of processes ultimately leading to observable structure modification and
damage. These effects were studied with a hybrid simulation tool XTANT-3. The
code combines several methods in one interconnected model: the photon
absorption and electron cascades are simulated with transport Monte Carlo;
nonequilibrium kinetics of slow electrons (in the valence and the bottom of the
conduction band) is traced with the Boltzmann equation; modeling evolution of
the electronic structure and interatomic potential is done with the
transferable tight binding method; and the response of the atomic system is
simulated with the molecular dynamics. Combining these methods enabled the
tracing of the essential effects of irradiation. This brief review summarizes
the recent results obtained with this simulation tool.

Most granular packings possess shear moduli ($G$) that increase with the
applied external pressure, and bulk moduli ($B$) that increase or remain
constant with pressure. This paper presents "tessellated" granular
metamaterials for which both $G$ and the ratio $G/B$ decrease with increasing
pressure. The granular metamaterials are made from flexible tessellations
forming a ring of closed cells, each containing a small number of solid
particles. For under-constrained tessellations, the dominant contributions to
$G$ and $B$ are the particle-particle and particle-cell interactions. With
specific particle configurations in the cells, we limit the number of possible
particle rearrangements to achieve decreasing $G$ as we increase the pressure
difference between the inside and outside of the tessellation, leading to $G/B
\ll 1$ at large pressures. We further study tessellated granular metamaterials
with cells containing a single particle and many particles to determine the
variables that control the mechanical response of particle-filled tessellations
as a function of pressure.
