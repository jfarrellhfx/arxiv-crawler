<h3>Field theories of active particle systems and their entropy production</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11906</a>

<br>
<br>
Active particles that translate chemical energy into self-propulsion can
maintain a far-from-equilibrium steady state and perform work. The entropy
production measures how far from equilibrium such a particle system operates
and serves as a proxy for the work performed. Field theory offers a promising
route to calculating entropy production, as it allows for many interacting
particles to be considered simultaneously. Approximate field theories obtained
by coarse-graining or smoothing that draw on additive noise can capture
densities and correlations well, but they generally ignore the microscopic
particle nature of the constituents, thereby producing spurious results for the
entropy production. As an alternative we demonstrate how to use Doi-Peliti
field theories, which capture the microscopic dynamics, including reactions and
interactions with external and pair potentials. Such field theories are in
principle exact, while offering a systematic approximation scheme, in the form
of diagrammatics. We demonstrate how to construct them from a Fokker-Planck
equation (FPE) of the single-particle dynamics and show how to calculate
entropy production of active matter from first principles. This framework is
easily extended to include interaction. We use it to derive exact, compact and
efficient general expressions for the entropy production for a vast range of
interacting particle systems. These expressions are independent of the
underlying field theory and can be interpreted as the spatial average of the
local entropy production. They are readily applicable to numerical and
experimental data. In general, any pair interaction draws at most on the three
point, equal time density and an n-point interaction on the (2n-1)-point
density. We illustrate the technique in a number of exact, tractable examples,
including some with pair-interaction.

<h3>Finite-size scaling and double-crossover critical behavior in  two-dimensional incompressible polar active fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12025" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12025</a>

We study the order-disorder transition in two-dimensional incompressible
systems of motile particles with alignment interactions through extensive
numerical simulations of the incompressible Toner-Tu (ITT) field theory and a
detailed finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis. The transition looks continuous in
the explored parameter space, but the effective susceptibility exponent
$\gamma/\nu$ and the dynamic exponent $z$ exhibit a strong, non-monotonic
variation on the system size in the form of double crossovers. At small sizes,
mean-field exponents are observed for the homogeneous $k=0$ mode whereas
spatial fluctuations follow Gaussian statistics. A first crossover marks the
departure from this regime to one where the system behaves like the equilibrium
XY model with long-ranged dipolar interaction and vortex excitations. At larger
sizes, scaling deviates from the dipolar XY behavior and a second crossover is
observed, to presumably the asymptotic ITT universality class. At this
crossover to genuinely off-equilibrium behavior, advection comes in to expedite
transport of fluctuations, suppress large-scale fluctuations and help stabilize
long-range order. We obtain estimates and bounds of the universal Binder
cumulant and exponents of the ITT class. We propose a reduced hydrodynamic
theory, previously overlooked, that quantitatively describes the first scaling
regime. By providing a relatively comprehensive numerical picture and a novel
analytical description, our results help elucidate finite-size effects in
critical active matter systems, which have been argued to be relevant for
understanding scale-free behavior in real flocks or swarms.

<h3>Dynamics of Motility-Induced clusters: coarsening beyond Ostwald  ripening</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the dynamics of clusters of Active Brownian Disks generated by
Motility-Induced Phase Separation, by applying an algorithm that we devised to
track cluster trajectories. We identify an aggregation mechanism that goes
beyond Ostwald ripening but also yields $z=3$. Active clusters of mass $M$
self-propel with enhanced diffusivity $D\sim$ Pe$^2/\sqrt{M}$. Their fast
motion drives aggregation into large fractal structures, which are patchworks
of diverse hexatic orders, and coexist with regular, orientationally uniform,
smaller ones. To bring out the impact of activity, we perform a comparative
study of a passive system that evidences major differences with the active
case.

We use a recently developed high-resolution coherent probe spectroscopy
method to investigate the dispersion of collective excitations of a polaritonic
quantum fluid. We measure the dispersion relation with high energy and
wavenumber resolution, which allows us to determine the speed of sound in the
fluid and to evidence the contribution of an excitonic reservoir. We report on
the generation of collective excitations at negative energies, on the ghost
branch of the dispersion curve. Precursors of dynamical instabilities are also
identified. Our methods open the way to the precise study of quantum
hydrodynamics of quantum fluids of light.

<h3>The 3D narrow capture problem for traps with semipermeable interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12472</a>
<br>
<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we analyze the narrow capture problem for a single Brownian
particle diffusing in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain containing a set
of small, spherical traps. The boundary surface of each trap is taken to be a
semipermeable membrane. That is, the continuous flux across the interface is
proportional to an associated jump discontinuity in the probability density.
The constant of proportionality is identified with the permeability $\kappa$.
In addition, we allow for discontinuities in the diffusivity and chemical
potential across each interface; the latter introduces a directional bias. We
also assume that the particle can be absorbed (captured) within the interior of
each trap at some Poisson rate $\gamma$. In the small-trap limit, we use
matched asymptotics and Green's function methods to calculate the splitting
probabilities and unconditional MFPT to be absorbed by one of the traps.
However, the details of the analysis depend on how various parameters scale
with the characteristic trap radius $\epsilon$. Under the scalings
$\gamma=O(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $\kappa=O(1/\epsilon)$, we show that the
semipermeable membrane reduces the effective capacitance $\calC$ of each
spherical trap compared to the standard example of totally absorbing traps.
Finally, we consider the unidirectional limit in which each interface only
allows particles to flow into a trap. The traps then act as partially absorbing
surfaces with a constant reaction rate $\kappa$. Combining asymptotic analysis
with the encounter-based formulation of partially reactive surfaces, we show
how a generalized surface absorption mechanism (non-Markovian) can be analyzed
in terms of the capacitances $\calC$. We thus establish that a wide range of
narrow capture problems can be characterized in terms of the effective
capacitances of the traps.

<h3>Impurity-induced pairing in two-dimensional Fermi gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12495" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12495</a>
<br>
<i>Ruipeng Li, Jonas von Milczewski, Atac Imamoglu, Rafał Ołdziejewski, Richard Schmidt</i>
<br>
<br>
We study induced pairing between two identical fermions mediated by an
attractively interacting quantum impurity in two-dimensional systems. Based on
a Stochastic Variational Method (SVM), we investigate the influence of
confinement and finite interaction range effects on the mass ratio beyond which
the ground state of the quantum three-body problem undergoes a transition from
a composite bosonic trimer to an unbound dimer-fermion state. We find that
confinement as well as a finite interaction range can greatly enhance trimer
stability, bringing it within reach of experimental implementations such as
found in ultracold atom systems. In the context of solid-state physics our
solution of the confined three-body problem shows that exciton-mediated
interactions can become so dominant that they can even overcome detrimental
Coulomb repulsion between electrons in atomically-thin semiconductors. Our work
thus paves the way towards a universal understanding of boson-induced pairing
across various fermionic systems at finite density, and opens perspectives
towards realizing novel forms of electron pairing beyond the conventional
paradigm of Cooper pair formation.

<h3>Higher-group symmetry in finite gauge theory and stabilizer codes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11764" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11764</a>

<i>Maissam Barkeshli, Yu-An Chen, Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi</i>

A large class of gapped phases of matter can be described by topological
finite group gauge theories. In this paper, we derive the $d$-group global
symmetry and its 't Hooft anomaly for topological finite group gauge theories
in $(d+1)$ space-time dimensions, including non-Abelian gauge groups and
Dijkgraaf-Witten twists. We focus on the 1-form symmetry generated by
invertible (Abelian) magnetic defects and the higher-form symmetries generated
by invertible topological defects decorated with lower dimensional gauged
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We show that due to a
generalization of the Witten effect and charge-flux attachment, the 1-form
symmetry generated by the magnetic defects mixes with other symmetries into a
higher group. We describe such higher-group symmetry in various lattice model
examples. We discuss several applications, including the classification of
fermionic SPT phases in (3+1)D for general fermionic symmetry groups, where we
also derive a simpler formula for the $[O_5] \in H^5(BG, U(1))$ obstruction
than has appeared in previous work. We also show how the $d$-group symmetry is
related to fault-tolerant non-Pauli logical gates and a refined Clifford
hierarchy in stabilizer codes. We construct new logical gates in stabilizer
codes using the $d$-group symmetry, such as the control-Z gate in (3+1)D
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code.

Phonons play a crucial role in many properties of solid state systems, such
as thermal and electrical conductivity, neutron scattering and associated
effects or superconductivity. Hence, it is expected that topological phonons
will also lead to rich and unconventional physics and the search of materials
hosting topological phonons becomes a priority in the field. In electronic
crystalline materials, a large part of the topological properties of Bloch
states can be indicated by their symmetry eigenvalues in reciprocal space. This
has been adapted to the high-throughput calculations of topological materials,
and more than half of the stoichiometric materials on the databases are found
to be topological insulators or semi-metals. Based on the existing phonon
materials databases, here we have performed the first catalogue of topological
phonon bands for more than ten thousand three-dimensional crystalline
materials. Using topological quantum chemistry, we calculate the band
representations, compatibility relations, and band topologies of each isolated
set of phonon bands for the materials in the phonon databases. We have also
calculated the real space invariants for all the topologically trivial bands
and classified them as atomic and obstructed atomic bands. In particular,
surface phonon modes (dispersion) are calculated on different cleavage planes
for all the materials. Remarkably, we select more than one thousand "ideal"
non-trivial phonon materials to fascinate the future experimental studies. All
the data-sets obtained in the the high-throughput calculations are used to
build a Topological Phonon Database.

<h3>Superconductivity in monolayer and few-layer graphene: II. Topological  edge states and Chern numbers</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the emergence of electronic edge states in superconducting (SC)
monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer graphene for both spin-singlet and
spin-triplet SC order parameters. We focus mostly on the gapped chiral $p+ip'$-
and $d+id'$-wave SC states that show a non-zero Chern number and a
corresponding number of edge states. For the $p+ip'$-wave state, we observe a
rich Chern phase diagram when tuning the chemical potential and the SC order
parameter amplitudes, which depends strongly on the number of layers and their
stacking, and is also modified by trigonal warping. At small parameter values
we observe a region whose Chern number is unique to rhombohedrally stacked
graphene, and is independent of the number of layers. Our results can be
understood in relation not only to the SC order parameter winding as expected,
but also to the normal state band structure. This observation establishes the
importance of the normal state characteristics for understanding the topology
in SC graphene systems.

<h3>Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST) transition with spherical iron  particles coated by adsorbed brush polymer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11807" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11807</a>
<br>
<i>Georges Bossis, Yan Grasselli, Olga Volkova</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we explore the rheology of very concentrated (0.55<$\Phi$<0.67)
suspensions of carbonyl iron (CI) particles coated by a small polymer. A strong
DST is observed in a large range of volume fraction presenting some
specificities relatively to other systems. In particular, in a given range of
volume fraction, the DST transition appears suddenly without being preceded by
shear thickening. The presence of a frictional network of particles is
confirmed by a simultaneous measurement of the electric resistance of the
suspension and of the rheological curve. Using the Wyart-Cates model we show
that, increasing the volume fraction, the fraction of frictional contacts grows
more and more quickly with the stress that disagrees with the prediction of
computer simulations. The same kind of behavior is observed in the presence of
a magnetic field with, in addition, a very strong increase of the viscosity
with the magnetic field before the transition. We interpret this behavior by
the interpenetration of the polymer layer under the effect of the shear
stress-and of the magnetic stress-followed by the expulsion of the polymer out
of the surfaces. Besides we point that, above the DST transition, we do not
observe a jamming in the range of volume fraction whereas it is predicted by
the W-C model. Based on the fact that in the absence of shear flow, the polymer
should come back to the surface and destroy the frictional contacts we can
predict an asymptotic non-zero shear rate and reproduce the experimental
behavior.

<h3>Topological field-effect transistor with quantized ON/OFF conductance of  helical/chiral dislocation states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11837" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11837</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Topology is a key ingredient driving the emergence of quantum devices.
Topological field-effect transistor (TFET) has been proposed to outperform the
conventional FET by replacing the ON state with topology-protected quantized
conductance, while the OFF state remains the same normal insulating
characteristics and hence bears similar drawbacks. Here, we demonstrate a
proof-of-concept TFET having both ON and OFF quantized conductance, by
switching between helical and chiral topological screw dislocation (SD) states
in three-dimensional topological insulators. A pair of SDs are configured with
one acting as channel and the other as gate controlled by local magnetic field.
A reversible field-switching is achieved with the ON and OFF conductance of
$2e^2/h$ and $e^2/h$, respectively, as shown by tight-binding quantum transport
calculations. Furthermore, BaBiO$_3$ is shown as a candidate material having
the desired topological SD states, based on first-principles calculations. Our
findings open a new route to high-fidelity topological quantum devices.

<h3>Time-dependent condensation of bosonic potassium</h3>

<i>Anton Kabelac, Georg Wolschin</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the time-dependent formation of Bose--Einstein condensates
(BECs) in potassium vapours based on a previously derived exactly solvable
nonlinear boson diffusion equation (NBDE). Thermalization following a sudden
energy quench from an initial temperature $T_\mathrm{i}$ to a final temperature
$T_\mathrm{f}$ below the critical value and BEC formation are accounted for
using closed-form analytical solutions of the NBDE. The time-dependent
condensate fraction is compared with available $^{39}$K data for various
scattering lengths.

<h3>An exact formula for the variance of linear statistics in the  one-dimensional jellium mode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11850</a>
<br>
<i>Ana Flack, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the jellium model of $N$ particles on a line confined in an
external harmonic potential and with a pairwise one-dimensional Coulomb
repulsion of strength $\alpha > 0$. Using a Coulomb gas method, we study the
statistics of $s = (1/N) \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$ where $f(x)$, in principle, is an
arbitrary smooth function. While the mean of $s$ is easy to compute, the
variance is nontrivial due to the long-range Coulomb interactions. In this
paper we demonstrate that the fluctuations around this mean are Gaussian with a
variance ${\rm Var}(s) \approx b/N^3$ for large $N$. We provide an exact
compact formula for the constant $b = 1/(4\alpha) \int_{-2 \alpha}^{2\alpha}
[f'(x)]^2\, dx$. In addition, we also calculate the full large deviation
function characterising the tails of the full distribution ${\cal P}(s,N)$ for
several different examples of $f(x)$. Our analytical predictions are confirmed
by numerical simulations.

<h3>Effects of physical and chemical pressure on charge density wave  transitions in LaAg1-xAuxSb2 single crystals</h3>

<i>Li Xiang, Dominic H. Ryan, Paul C. Canfield, Sergey L. Bud'ko</i>
<br>
<br>
The structural characterization and electrical transport measurements at
ambient and applied pressures of the compounds of the La(Ag1-xAux)Sb2 family
are presented. Up to two charge density wave (CDW) transitions could be
detected upon cooling from room temperature and an equivalence of the effects
of chemical and physical pressure on the CDW ordering temperatures was observed
with the unit cell volume being a salient structural parameter. As such
La(Ag1-xAux)Sb2 is a rare example of a non-cubic system that exhibits good
agreement between the effects of applied, physical, pressure and changes in
unit cell volume from steric changes induced by isovalent substitution.
Additionally, for La(Ag0.54Au0.46)Sb2 anomalies in low temperature electrical
transport were observed in the pressure range where the lower charge density
wave is completely suppressed.

<h3>Dual-stage structural response to quenching charge order in magnetite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11894</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The Verwey transition in magnetite (Fe3O4 ) is the prototypical
metal-insulator transition and has eluded a comprehensive explanation for
decades. A major element of the challenge is the complex interplay between
charge order and lattice distortions. Here we use ultrafast electron
diffraction (UED) to disentangle the roles of charge order and lattice
distortions by tracking the transient structural evolution after charge order
is melted via ultrafast photoexcitation. A dual stage response is observed in
which X3, X1, and Delta5 type structural distortions occur on markedly
different timescales of 0.7 to 3.2 ps and longer than 3.2 ps. We propose that
these distinct timescales arise because X3 type distortions strongly couple to
the trimeron charge order, whereas the Delta5-distortions are more strongly
associated with monoclinic to cubic distortions of the overall lattice. Our
work aids in clarifying the charge lattice interplay using UED method and
illustrates the disentanglement of the complex phases in magnetite.

<h3>The structure of thin boron nanowires predicted using evolutionary  computations</h3>

<i>Tomasz Tarkowski, Nevill Gonzalez Szwacki</i>
<br>
<br>
This work describes the implementation of a genetic algorithm-based strategy
combined with first-principles computations for identifying the structure of
the most stable boron 1D structures. We focus our attention on the structure of
ultrathin 1D boron structures given the lack of previous experimental and
theoretical work on this topic. Our methodology yields reasonable structural
candidates for further optimizations at the DFT level with tighter convergence
criteria. The simulations involved 1D structures with up to 8 atoms per unit
cell. We have identified four main groups of structures: flat nanowires
(monatomic-height stripes) with triangular or triangular and "square" motifs,
stripes with larger holes, nanowires with an open tubular shape, and regular
nanowires. The diameter-dependent structural changes are discussed.

<h3>Melting, Reentrant Ordering and Peak Effect for Wigner Crystals with  Quenched and Thermal Disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11911" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11911</a>
<br>
<i>C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider simulations of Wigner crystals interacting with random quenched
disorder in the presence of thermal fluctuations. When quenched disorder is
absent, there is a well defined melting temperature determined by the
proliferation of topological defects, while for zero temperature, there is a
critical quenched disorder strength above which topological defects
proliferate. When both thermal and quenched disorder are present, these effects
compete, and the thermal fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of the
quenched disorder, leading to a reentrant ordered phase in agreement with the
predictions of Nelson [Phys. Rev. B 27, 2902 (1983)]. The onset of the
reentrant phase can be deduced based on changes in the transport response,
where the reentrant ordering appears as an increase in the mobility or the
occurrence of a depinning transition. We also find that when the system is in
the ordered state and thermally melts, there is an increase in the effective
damping or pinning. This produces a drop in the electron mobility that is
similar to the peak effect phenomenon found in superconducting vortices, where
thermal effects soften the lattice or break down its elasticity, allowing the
particles to better adjust their positions to take full advantage of the
quenched disorder.

<h3>Universal entanglement and correlation measure in two-dimensional  conformal field theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11952</a>
<br>
<i>Chao Yin, Zhenhuan Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the amount of entanglement shared by two intervals in the ground
state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), quantified by an
entanglement measure $\mathcal{E}$ based on the computable cross norm (CCNR)
criterion. Unlike negativity or mutual information, we show that $\mathcal{E}$
has a universal expression even for two disjoint intervals, which depends only
on the geometry, the central charge c, and the thermal partition function of
the CFT. We prove this universal expression in the replica approach, where the
Riemann surface for calculating $\mathcal{E}$ at each order n is always a torus
topologically. By analytic continuation, result of n=1/2 gives the value of
$\mathcal{E}$. Furthermore, the results of other values of n also yield
meaningful conclusions: The n=1 result gives a general formula for the
two-interval purity, which enables us to calculate the Renyi-2 N-partite
information for N<=4 intervals; while the $n=\infty$ result bounds the
correlation function of the two intervals. We verify our findings numerically
in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, whose ground state is described by the Luttinger
liquid.

Atomic-scale characterization of spin textures in solids is essential for
understanding and tuning properties of magnetic materials and devices. While
high-energy electrons are employed for atomic-scale imaging of materials, they
are insensitive to the spin textures. In general, the magnetic contribution to
the phase of high-energy electron wave is weaker than the electrostatic
potential by a factor of three or more orders of magnitude. Via accurate phase
retrieval through electron ptychography, here we show that the magnetic phase
can be directly separated from the electrostatic one, opening the door to
atomic-resolution characterization of spin textures in magnetic materials and
devices.

Quantum critical points associated with charge density wave (CDW) and phonon
softening are considered broadly as a route to enhance superconductivity. In
this work, the effects of anomalous soft phonon instabilities on
superconductivity are studied based on a recently developed theoretical
framework that accounts for phonon damping and softening within the
Migdal-Eliashberg theory. Model calculations show that the phonon softening in
the form of a sharp dip in the phonon dispersion relation, either acoustic or
optical (including the case of Kohn-type anomalies typically associated with
CDW), can cause a manifold increase of the electron-phonon coupling constant
$\lambda$. This, under certain conditions, which are consistent with the
concept of optimal frequency introduced by Bergmann and Rainer, can produce a
large increase of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. In summary,
our results suggest the possibility of reaching high-temperature
superconductivity by exploiting soft phonon anomalies restricted in momentum.

Multiphysics problems such as multicomponent diffusion, phase transformations
in multiphase systems and alloy solidification involve numerical solution of a
coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical
solutions of these PDEs using mesh-based methods require spatiotemporal
discretization of these equations. Hence, the numerical solutions are often
sensitive to discretization parameters and may have inaccuracies (resulting
from grid-based approximations). Moreover, choice of finer mesh for higher
accuracy make these methods computationally expensive. Neural network-based PDE
solvers are emerging as robust alternatives to conventional numerical methods
because these use machine learnable structures that are grid-independent, fast
and accurate. However, neural network based solvers require large amount of
training data, thus affecting their generalizabilty and scalability. These
concerns become more acute for coupled systems of time-dependent PDEs. To
address these issues, we develop a new neural network based framework that uses
encoder-decoder based conditional Generative Adversarial Networks with ConvLSTM
layers to solve a system of Cahn-Hilliard equations. These equations govern
microstructural evolution of a ternary alloy undergoing spinodal decomposition
when quenched inside a three-phase miscibility gap. We show that the trained
models are mesh and scale-independent, thereby warranting application as
effective neural operators.

<h3>Transport properties of polydisperse hard sphere fluid: Effect of  distribution shape and mass scaling</h3>

A model polydisperse fluid represents many real fluids such as colloidal
suspensions and polymer solutions. In this study, considering a concentrated
size-polydisperse hard sphere fluid with size derived from two different
distribution functions, namely, uniform and Gaussian and explore the effect of
polydispersity and mass scaling on the transport properties in general. A
simple analytical solution based on the Boltzmann transport equation is also
presented (together with the solution using Chapman-Enskog (CE) method) using
which various transport coefficients are obtained. The central idea of our
approach is the realization that, in polydisperse system, the collision
scattering cross section is proportional to a random variable \textit{z} which
is equal to the sum of two random variables $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_j$
(representing particle diameters), and the distribution of \textit{z} can be
written as the convolution of the two distributions $P(\sigma_i)$ and
$P(\sigma_j)$. The obtained transport coefficients are expressed as explicit
function of polydispersity index, $\delta$, and their dependence on the nature
of particle size distribution is explored. It is observed that in the low
polydispersity limit, the transport coefficients are found to be insensitive to
the type of size distribution functions considered. The analytical results (for
diffusion coefficients and thermal conductivity) obtained using Chapman-Enskog
method and our simple analytical approach agrees well with the simulation.
However, for shear viscosity, our analyical approach agress for $\delta \le
20\%$, while it agrees upto $\delta \approx 40\%$ with the result obtained
using CE-method (in the limit $\delta \rightarrow 0$). Interestingly, the
effect of scaling mass (i.e., mass proportional to the particle size and thus a
random variable) produces no significant qualitative difference.

Machine-learning methods are nowadays of common use in the field of material
science. For example, they can aid in optimizing the physicochemical properties
of new materials, or help in the characterization of highly complex chemical
compounds. An especially challenging problem arises in the modeling of
chemically disordered solid solutions, for which some properties depend on the
distribution of chemical species in the crystal lattice. This is the case of
defect properties of uranium-plutonium mixed oxides nuclear fuels. The number
of possible configurations is so high that the problem becomes intractable if
treated with direct sampling. We thus propose a machine learning approach,
based on generative modeling, to optimize the exploration of this large
configuration space. A probabilistic, semi-supervised approach using Mixture
Density Network is applied to estimate the concentration of thermal defects in
(U, Pu)O2. We show that this method, based on the prediction of the density of
states of formation energy of a defect, is computationally much more
cost-efficient compared to other approaches available in the literature.

Catalysis, the acceleration of chemical reactions by molecules that are not
consumed in the process, is essential to living organisms but currently absent
in physical systems that aspire to emulate biological functionalities with
artificial components. Here we demonstrate how to design a catalyst using
spherical building blocks interacting via programmable potentials, and show
that a minimal catalyst design, a rigid dimer, can accelerate a ubiquitous
elementary reaction, the cleaving of a bond. By combining coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations and theory, and by comparing the mean reaction
time in the presence and absence of the catalyst, we derive geometrical and
physical constraints for its design and determine the reaction conditions under
which catalysis emerges in the system. The framework and design rules that we
introduce are general and can be applied to experimental systems on a wide
range of scales, from micron size DNA-coated colloids to centimeter size
magnetic handshake materials, opening the door to the realization of
self-regulated artificial systems with bio-inspired functionalities.

Non-reciprocal charge transport in supercurrent diodes (SDs) polarized
growing interest in the last few years for its potential applications in
superconducting electronics (SCE). So far, SD effects have been reported in
complex hybrid superconductor/semiconductor structures or metallic systems
subject to moderate magnetic fields, thus showing a limited potentiality for
practical applications in SCE. Here, we report the design and the realization
of a monolithic SD by exploiting a Dayem bridge-based superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID). Our structure allows reaching rectification
efficiencies ($\eta$) up to about 6%. Moreover, the absolute value and the
polarity of $\eta$ can be selected on demand by the modulation of an external
magnetic flux or by a gate voltage, thereby guaranteeing high versatility and
improved switching speed. Furthermore, our SD operates in a wide range of
temperatures up to about the 70% of the superconducting critical temperature of
the titanium film composing the interferometer. Our SD can find extended
applications in SCE by operating in synergy with widespread superconducting
technologies, such as nanocryotrons, rapid single flux quanta (RSFQs) and
memories.

In this study, we experimentally study the dried pattern droplets of coffee
with and without sugar. We statistically analyze the rough surface formed after
the stain becomes dried. The amount of sugar is controlled by the mass $m$.
Along with the formation of the coffee ring, we discuss the Marangoni effect,
in the system, and also analyzed the statistics of the cracks. For large enough
$m$ values, the exponents approach to the ones for the Gaussian free field
(GFF) (the loop fractal dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, loop and gyration radius
distribution exponents $\tau_l=\frac{7}{3}$ and $\tau_r=3$ respectively). Using
the multifractal analysis (MA) for the mass configuration of the dried pattern,
we numerically show that, the mass-fractal dimension is $1.76\pm 0.04$ for the
case without sugar, which decreases increasing the sugar. This is explained by
the fact that the droplet becomes more hydrophilic, resulting in more sparse
spatial patterns, in agreement compatible with the contact angle analysis.

In time-resolved pump-probe vibrational spectroscopy the internal stretch
mode of polar molecules is utilized as a key observable to characterize the
ultrafast dynamics of adsorbates on surfaces. The adsorbates non-adiabatic
intermode couplings are the commonly accepted mechanisms behind the observed
transient frequency shifts. Here, we study the CO/Pd(111) system with a robust
theoretical framework that includes electron-hole pair excitations and
electron-mediated coupling between the vibrational modes. A mechanism is
revealed that screens the electron-phonon interaction and originates a
blueshift under ultrafast non-equilibrium conditions. The results are explained
in terms of the abrupt change in the density of states around the Fermi level,
and are instrumental for understanding dynamics at multi-component surfaces
involving localized and standard $s$ or $p$ states.

<br>
Homophily, the tendency of humans to attract each other when sharing similar
features, traits, or opinions has been identified as one of the main driving
forces behind the formation of structured societies. Here we ask to what extent
homophily can explain the formation of social groups, particularly their size
distribution. We propose a spin-glass-inspired framework of self-assembly,
where opinions are represented as multidimensional spins that dynamically
self-assemble into groups; individuals within a group tend to share similar
opinions (intra-group homophily), and opinions between individuals belonging to
different groups tend to be different (inter-group heterophily). We compute the
associated non-trivial phase diagram by solving a self-consistency equation for
'magnetization' (combined average opinion). Below a critical temperature, there
exist two stable phases: one ordered with non-zero magnetization and large
clusters, the other disordered with zero magnetization and no clusters. The
system exhibits a first-order transition to the disordered phase. We
analytically derive the group-size distribution that successfully matches
empirical group-size distributions from online communities.

In pump-probe spectroscopy, two laser pulses are employed to garner dynamical
information from the sample of interest. The pump initiates the optical process
by exciting a portion of the sample from the electronic ground state to an
accessible electronic excited state, an exciton. Thereafter, the probe
interacts with the already excited sample. The change in the absorbance after
pump provides information on transitions between the excited states and their
dynamics. In this work we study these exciton-exciton transitions by means of
an ab initio real time propagation scheme based on dynamical Berry phase
formulation. The results are then analyzed taking advantage of a Fermi-golden
rule approach formulated in the excitonic basis-set and in terms of the
symmetries of the excitonic states. Using bulk LiF and 2D hBN as two prototype
materials, we discuss the selection rules for transitions involving strongly
bound Frenkel excitons, for which the hydrogen model cannot be used.

<br>
The ferrimagnets, such as GdxFeCo(1-x), can produce ultrafast magnetic
switching and oscillation due to the strong exchange field. The two-sublattices
macrospin model has been widely used to explain the experimental results.
However, it fails in describing the spatial nonuniform magnetic dynamics which
gives rises to many important phenomenons such as the domain walls and
skyrmions. Here we develop the two-dimensional atomistic model and provide a
torque analysis method to study the ferrimagnetic oscillation. Under the
spin-transfer torque, the magnetization oscillates in the exchange mode or the
flipped exchange mode. When the Gd composition is increased, the exchange mode
firstly disappears, and then appears again as the magnetization compensation
point is reached. We show that these results can only be explained by analyzing
the spatial distribution of magnetization and effective fields. In particular,
when the sample is small, a spatial nonuniform oscillation is also observed in
the square film. Our work reveals the importance of spatial magnetic
distributions in understanding the ferrimagnetic dynamics. The method developed
in this paper provides an important tool to gain a deeper understanding of
ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets. The observed ultrafast dynamics can also
stimulate the development of THz oscillators.

The theory of disordered elastic systems is one of the most powerful
frameworks to asses the physics of multiple systems that span from ferromagnets
to migrating biological cells. In this formalism, one assumes that the system
can be described with a displacement field. This field can represent an
interface position, the deformation of a vortex lattice or charge density waves
in semiconductor devices, among others. By construction, this field is
univalued and 'smooth', and, even if experimental realisations of it can be far
from this description, the consequences of these approximations have not been
yet fully explored. We present a new observable to measure the roughness of
displacement fields that can be beyond the elastic limit and can contain
overhangs and other defects. Our observable represents a stepping stone towards
the construction of a general theory for interfaces.

Fabrication of new types of superconductors with novel physical properties
has always been a major thread in the research of superconducting materials. An
example is the enormous interests generated by the cascade of correlated
topological quantum states in the newly discovered vanadium-based kagome
superconductors AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, and Cs) with a Z2 topological band structure.
Here we report the successful fabrication of single-crystals of titanium-based
kagome metal CsTi3Bi5 and the observation of superconductivity and electronic
nematicity. The onset of the superconducting transition temperature Tc is
around 4.8 K. In sharp contrast to the charge density wave superconductor
AV3Sb5, we find that the kagome superconductor CsTi3Bi5 preserves translation
symmetry, but breaks rotational symmetry and exhibits an electronic nematicity.
The angular-dependent magnetoresistivity shows a remarkable two-fold rotational
symmetry as the magnetic field rotates in the kagome plane. The scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopic imaging detect rotational-symmetry
breaking C2 quasiparticle interference patterns (QPI) at low energies,
providing further microscopic evidence for electronic nematicity. Combined with
first-principle calculations, we find that the nematic QPI is orbital-selective
and dominated by the Ti dxz and dyz orbitals, possibly originating from the
intriguing orbital bond nematic order. Our findings in the new "135" material
CsTi3Bi5 provide new directions for exploring the multi-orbital correlation
effect and the role of orbital or bond order in the electron liquid crystal
phases evidenced by the symmetry breaking states in kagome superconductors.

We experimentally investigated the role of boundary confinements in shear
thickening suspensions. Unexpected rheological responses were observed across
multiple length scales under highly confined geometries. The flow curves were
found to equilibrate at a very slow rate, and appeared S-shaped in steady
states. By combining shear rheological characterizations with boundary stress
microscopy (BSM), we observed sustained local stress oscillations in confined
suspensions. The stress heterogeneities were induced by concentrated
high-stress clusters that traveled stably along the flow direction. We show
that the growth and relaxation of these particle clusters contributed to the
non-monotonic flow curves, and mitigated the fluctuations of global shear rate.
By comparing the flow properties under different system sizes, we uncovered how
boundary confinements effectively determined both the rheological and
statistical responses of dense suspensions to shear thickening transitions.

The combination of wide-band gap semiconductors like zinc oxide (ZnO) and
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is a promising strategy to tune optoelectronic
properties of GQDs and to develop new functionalities. Here we report on a
theoretical design of not-yet-synthesized hybrid materials composed of ZnO
clusters surrounded by carbon moieties, hereinafter referred to as ZnO-embedded
graphene quantum dots. Their structure and light absorption properties are
presented, with an in-depth analysis of the nature of the photoexcited states.
The stability of the (ZnO)nC96-2n system with n=1, 3, 4, 7, 12 and 27 is
investigated by estimating cohesive energy and performing vibrational mode
analysis. A strong dependence of the structural and optoelectronic properties
of the hybrid material on the amount of ZnO pairs is revealed and discussed. A
strong light absorption and unexpected enhancement of Raman modes related to
the vibrations in carbon moiety are observed for highly symmetric (ZnO)27C42
system that makes it an ideal study subject. Complementary excited state
analysis, charge density difference (CDD) analysis and interfragment charge
transfer analysis enabled reaching deep insights into the nature of the excited
states. A dominating contribution of doubly degenerate locally excited states
in broadband light absorption by (ZnO)27C42 is identified. The present results
are helpful to elucidate the nature of the fundamental internal mechanisms
underlying the light absorption in ZnO-embedded graphene quantum dots, thereby
providing a scientific background for future experimental study of
low-dimensional metal-oxygen-carbon materials family.

We measure the thermalization dynamics of a lattice Bose gas that is Stark
localized by a parabolic potential. A non-equilibrium thermal density
distribution is created by quickly removing an optical barrier. The resulting
spatio-temporal dynamics are resolved using Mardia's $B$ statistic, which is a
measure sensitive to the shape of the entire density distribution. We conclude
that equilibrium is achieved for all lattice potential depths that we sample,
including the strongly interacting and localized regime. However,
thermalization is slow and non-exponential, requiring up to 500 tunneling
times. We show that the Hubbard $U$ term is not responsible for thermalization
via comparison to an exact diagonalization calculation, and we rule out
equilibration driven by lattice-light heating by varying the laser wavelength.
The thermalization timescale is comparable to the next-nearest-neighbor
tunneling time, which suggests that a continuum, strongly interacting theory
may be needed to understand equlibration in this system.

We analyze the singular value decomposition (SVD) and SVD entropy of Cantor
fractals produced by the Kronecker product. Our primary results show that SVD
entropy is a measure of image ``complexity dimension" that is invariant under
the number of Kronecker-product self-iterations (i.e., fractal order). SVD
entropy is therefore similar to the fractal Hausdorff complexity dimension but
suitable for characterizing fractal wave phenomena. Our field-based
normalization (Renyi entropy index = 1) illustrates the uncommon step-shaped
and cluster-patterned distributions of the fractal singular values and their
SVD entropy. As a modal measure of complexity, SVD entropy has uses for a
variety of wireless communication, free-space optical, and remote sensing
applications.

We employ the diffusing transcription factors model for numerical simulation

pathways to regulate transcription: it is shown that the transcriptional
activity profile can be regulated and controlled by either acting on the chain
structural properties, or on external factors, such as the number of
transcription factors. Additionally, comparisons between GRO-seq experimental
data and large scale numerical simulation of entire chromosomes from the human

provides reliable and statistically significant predictions for transcription
across different cell-lines.

Recently, the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between
magnetic impurities has been extensively studied for characterizing the surface
states of topological materials. In this paper, we investigate the RKKY
interaction solely mediated by a single surface band of WSMs, distinguished
from previous literatures where surface states have to couple with bulk states
(or other surface states of different spins) to generate nonzero magnetic
interaction. The interaction here is controlled by two mechanisms: the
finite-region effect of the surface states in momentum space and the bending
effect of the surface band. We analyze the decays and oscillations of the RKKY
interaction numerically and analytically. The anisotropy of the magnetic
interaction is revealed by considering different arrangements of the
impurities. Specially, for impurities placed along the direction perpendicular
to the Weyl points splitting, the surface contributions always decay much more
slowly with impurity distance than that of bulk states. For each mechanism,
different magnetic signals are extracted from the RKKY interaction to capture
the dispersive nature of the surface states. We further discuss the competition
of the two mechanisms, which results in more complex decaying behaviors for the
RKKY interaction. In addition, we find that the former mechanism together with
the finite Fermi energy would result in an interesting oscillation with
battering pattern. Compared to the surface states of WSMs used in previous
literatures, the model here is more practical and is helpful for the deeper
understanding of the surface magnetic properties in WSMs.

Applying an electric field to polarisable colloidal particles, whose
permittivity differs from that of the dispersing medium, generates induced
dipoles that promote the formation of string-like clusters and ultimately alter
the fluid mechanical and rheological properties. Complex systems of this kind,
whose electric-field-induced rheology can be manipulated between that of
viscous and elastic materials, are referred to as electrorheological fluids. By
dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamics of self-assembly
of dielectric nanocubes upon application of an electric field. Switching the
field on induces in-particle dipoles and, at sufficiently large field
intensity, leads to stringlike clusters of variable length across a spectrum of
volume fractions. The kinetics of switching from the isotropic to the
string-like state suggests the existence of two mechanisms, the first related
to the nucleation of chains and the second to the competition between further
merging and separation. We characterise the transient unsteady state by
following the chain length distribution and analysing the probability of
transition of nanocubes from one chain to another over time. Additionally, we
employ passive microrheology to gain an insight into the effect of the electric
field on the viscoelastic response of our model fluid. Not only do we observe
that it becomes more viscoelastic in the presence of the field, but also that
its viscoelasticity assumes an anisotropic signature, with both viscous and
elastic moduli in planes perpendicular to the external field being larger than
those along it.

The static and the dynamic properties of a size-polydisperse model ionic
liquid is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, size of the
anions is derived from a Gaussian distribution while keeping cation size fixed,
resulting in a system that closely corresponds to IL mixtures with a common
cation. We systematically explore the behavior of thermodynamic transition
temperatures, spatial ordering of ions and the resulting screening behavior as
a function of polydispersity index, $\delta$. We observe a non-monotonic
dependence of transition temperatures on $\delta$, and this non-monotonic
behaviour is also reflected in other properties such as screening length.
Furthermore, from the radial distribution function analysis it is found that,
upon varying $\delta$, the spatial ordering of cations is affected, while no
such changes is seen for anion. On the other hand, the analysis of ion motion
through mean-square displacement show that for all $\delta$ values considered
both inertial and diffusive regimes are observed (as expected in the liquid
state). However, in contrast to neutral counterpart, the overall relaxation
time of the polydisperse IL system increases (and hence decreasing diffusion
coefficient) with increasing $\delta$.

We present a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance
(ESR) study of rare-earth titanates derived from the spin-1/2 Mott insulator
YTiO$_3$. Measurements of single-crystalline samples of (Y,Ca,La)TiO$_3$ in a
wide range of isovalent substitution (La) and hole doping (Ca) reveal several
unusual features in the paramagnetic state of these materials. $^{89}$Y NMR
demonstrates a clear discrepancy between the static and dynamic local magnetic
susceptibilities, with deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior far above the Curie
temperature $T_C$. No significant changes are observed close to $T_C$, but a
suppression of fluctuations is detected in the NMR spin-lattice relaxation time
at temperatures of about $3\times T_C$. Additionally, the nuclear spin-spin
relaxation rate shows an unusual peak in dependence on temperature for all
samples. ESR of the unpaired Ti electron shows broad resonance lines at all
temperatures and substitution/doping levels, which we find to be caused by
short electronic spin-lattice relaxation times. We model the relaxation as an
Orbach process that involves a low-lying electronic excited state, which
enables the determination of the excited-state gap from the temperature
dependence of the ESR linewidths. We ascribe the small gap to Jahn-Teller
splitting of the two lower Ti $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The value of the gap closely
follows $T_C$ and is consistent with the temperatures at which deviations from
Curie-Weiss fluctuations are observed in NMR. These results provide insight
into the interplay between orbital and spin degrees of freedom in rare-earth
titanates and indicate that full orbital degeneracy lifting is associated with
ferromagnetic order.

<h3>Dynamics of lattice random walk within regions composed of different  media and interfaces</h3>

<i>Debraj Das, Luca Giuggioli</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the lattice random walk dynamics in a heterogeneous space of two
media separated by an interface and having different diffusivity and bias.
Depending on the position of the interface, there exist two exclusive ways to
model the dynamics: (1) Type A dynamics whereby the interface is placed between
two lattice points, and (2) Type B dynamics whereby the interface is placed on
a lattice point. For both types, we obtain exact results for the
one-dimensional generating function of the Green's function or propagator for
the composite system in unbounded domain as well as domains confined with
reflecting, absorbing, and mixed boundaries. For the case with reflecting
confinement in the absence of bias, the steady-state probability shows a
step-like behavior for the Type A dynamics, while it is uniform for the Type B
dynamics. We also derive explicit expressions for the first-passage probability
and the mean first-passage time, and compare the hitting time dependence to a
single target. Finally, considering the continuous-space continuous-time limit
of the propagator, we obtain the boundary conditions at the interface. At the
interface, while the flux is the same, the probability density is discontinuous
for Type A and is continuous for Type B. For the latter we derive a generalized
version of the so-called leather boundary condition in the appropriate limit.

We discuss the codimension-1 defects of (2+1)D bosonic topological phases,
where the defects can support fermionic degrees of freedom. We refer to such
defects as fermionic defects, and introduce a certain subclass of invertible
fermionic defects called "gauged Gu-Wen SPT defects" that can shift
self-statistics of anyons. We derive a canonical form of a general fermionic
invertible defect, in terms of the fusion of a gauged Gu-Wen SPT defect and a
bosonic invertible defect decoupled from fermions on the defect. We then derive
the fusion rule of generic invertible fermionic defects. The gauged Gu-Wen SPT
defects give rise to interesting logical gates of stabilizer codes in the
presence of additional ancilla fermions. For example, we find a realization of
the CZ logical gate on the (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code stacked with a
(2+1)D ancilla trivial atomic insulator. We also investigate a gapped fermionic
interface between (2+1)D bosonic topological phases realized on the boundary of
the (3+1)D Walker-Wang model. In that case, the gapped interface can shift the
chiral central charge of the (2+1)D phase. Among these fermionic interfaces, we
study an interesting example where the (3+1)D phase has a spatial reflection
symmetry, and the fermionic interface is supported on a reflection plane that
interpolates a (2+1)D surface topological order and its orientation-reversal.
We construct a (3+1)D exactly solvable Hamiltonian realizing this setup, and
find that the model generates the $\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of the (3+1)D
invertible phase with spatial reflection symmetry and fermion parity on the
reflection plane. We make contact with an effective field theory, known in
literature as the exotic invertible phase with spacetime higher-group symmetry.

<h3>Generation of out-of-plane polarized spin current by spin swapping</h3>

<br>
<br>
The generation of spin currents and their application to the manipulation of
magnetic states is fundamental to spintronics. Of particular interest are
chiral antiferromagnets that exhibit properties typical of ferromagnetic
materials even though they have negligible magnetization. Here, we report the
generation of a robust spin current with both in-plane and out-of-plane spin
polarization in epitaxial thin films of the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn in
proximity to permalloy thin layers. By employing temperature-dependent
spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we find that the chiral antiferromagnetic
structure of Mn3Sn is responsible for an in-plane polarized spin current that
is generated from the interior of the Mn3Sn layer and whose temperature
dependence follows that of this layer's antiferromagnetic order. On the other
hand, the out-of-plane spin polarized spin current is unrelated to the chiral
antiferromagnetic structure and is instead the result of scattering from the
Mn3Sn/permalloy interface. We substantiate the later conclusion by performing
studies with several other non-magnetic metals all of which are found to
exhibit out-of-plane polarized spin currents arising from the spin swapping
effect.

<h3>Contact Resistance Study of Various Metal Electrodes with CVD Graphene</h3>

In this study, the contact resistance of various metals to chemical vapour
deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene is investigated. Transfer length method
(TLM) structures with varying widths and separation between contacts have been
fabricated and electrically characterized in ambient air and vacuum condition.
Electrical contacts are made with five metals: gold, nickel, nickel/gold,
palladium and platinum/gold. The lowest value of 92 {\Omega}{\mu}m is observed
for the contact resistance between graphene and gold, extracted from back-gated
devices at an applied back-gate bias of -40 V. Measurements carried out under
vacuum show larger contact resistance values when compared with measurements
carried out in ambient conditions. Post processing annealing at 450{\deg}C for
1 hour in argon-95% / hydrogen-5% atmosphere results in lowering the contact
resistance value which is attributed to the enhancement of the adhesion between
metal and graphene. The results presented in this work provide an overview for
potential contact engineering for high performance graphene-based electronic
devices.

<h3>Non-conservation of the valley density and its implications for the  observation of the valley Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12428</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Kazantsev, Amelia Mills, Eoin O'Neill, Giovanni Vignale, Alessandro Principi</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the conservation of the valley density in a multi-valley
insulator is broken in an unexpected way by an electric field, such as the one
that is used to drive the valley Hall effect. This observation explains how a
fully gapped insulator (i.e., one without edge states that cross the Fermi
level) can support a valley Hall current in the bulk and yet show no valley
density accumulation at the edges. If the insulator is not fully gapped, either
because there are edge states crossing the Fermi level or because carriers are
introduced in the conduction or valence band, then valley density accumulation
at the edges is possible, paving the way to a direct observation of the valley
Hall effect. However, the magnitude of the accumulation depends crucially on
the inclusion of the anomalous electric field term in the continuity equation
that relates valley current and density.

<h3>Insulating Phase in Two-dimensional Josephson-Junction Arrays  Investigated by Nonlinear Transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12435" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12435</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroki Ikegami, Yasunobu Nakamura</i>
<br>
<br>
We present experimental investigations of transport properties in the
insulating phase of two-dimensional Josephson-junction arrays (JJAs) by
systematically changing the ratio of Josephson energy $E_\mathrm{J}$ and
charging energy $E_\mathrm{C}$. The observed temperature dependence of
resistance indicates that the JJAs do not show a sharp phase transition but
exhibit a gradual crossover to the insulating phase. At low temperatures, the
current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics become nonlinear as described by
$I=cV+bV^a$ ($a$, $b$, and $c$ are temperature dependent coefficients). This
nonlinear behavior is understood in terms of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism by taking into account the
influence of a finite-range cutoff of the logarithmic interaction between
Cooper pairs. From the analysis of the nonlinearity, we deduce the crossover
temperature to the insulating phase and determine the phase diagram in the
insulating side as a function of $E_\mathrm{J} /E_\mathrm{C}$. We also show
that, at very low temperatures, the $I$-$V$ characteristics continuously
develop into the negative differential conductance caused by coherent
single-Cooper-pair tunneling.

<br>
<br>
Heusler alloys based magnetic tunnel junctions can potentially provide high
magnetoresistance, small damping and fast switching. Here junctions with
Co2FeAl as a ferromagnetic electrode are fabricated by room temperature
sputtering on Si/SiO2 substrates. The doping of Boron in Co2FeAl is found to
have a large positive impact on the structural, magnetic and transport
properties of the junctions, with a reduced interfacial roughness and
substantial improved tunneling magnetoresistance. A two-level magnetoresistance
is also observed in samples annealed at low temperature, which is believed to
be related to the memristive effect of the tunnel barrier with impurities.

<h3>Staircase penetration of magnetic flux into a superconducting flat ring</h3>

<br>
<i>Leonid Burlachkov, Nikita Fuzailov</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyzed the distribution of the Meissner shielding currents in a flat
superconducting ring and quantitatively described the penetration of magnetic
avalanches (dendrites) inside it. Using a recurrent procedure, the external
field $H_{ext}$, in which a perforating (rim crossing) avalanche appears, is
calculated. A staircase dependence of the mean field trapped inside a ring,
$\left\langle H\right\rangle$, vs. $H_{ext}$, is comprehensively described. A
staircase slope appears to be a universal function of a ring shape (rim width
to ring diameter ratio). The heat released by a penetrating dendrite grows
linearly with each next perforation. Flux pinning, if present, modifies a
staircase dependence and makes steps smaller. Our theoretical results are in a
good accordance with the experimental data.

<h3>Elastocaloric signatures of symmetric and antisymmetric strain-tuning of  quadrupolar and magnetic phases in DyB2C2</h3>

<br>
<br>
The adiabatic elastocaloric effect measures the temperature change of given
systems with strain and probes the entropic landscape in the temperature-strain
space. In this study we demonstrate that the DC bias strain-dependence of AC
elastocaloric effect can be used to decompose the latter into contributions
from symmetric (rotation-symmetry-preserving) and antisymmetric
(rotation-symmetry-breaking) strains, using a tetragonal f-electron system
DyB2C2--whose antiferroquadrupolar order locally breaks four-fold rotational
site symmetries while globally remaining tetragonal--as a showcase example. We
capture the strain evolution of the quadrupolar and magnetic phase transitions
in the system using both singularities in the elastocaloric coefficient and its
jump at the transitions, and the latter we show follows a modified Ehrenfest
relation. We find that antisymmetric strain couples to the underlying order
parameter in a bi-quadratic manner in the antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) phase but
in a linear-quadratic manner in the canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) phase; the
contrast is attributed to a preserved (broken) tetragonal symmetry in the AFQ
(CAFM) phase, respectively. The broken tetragonal symmetry in the CAFM phase is
further supported by elastocaloric strain-hysteresis and observation of two
sets of domains with mutually perpendicular principal axes in optical
birefringence. Additionally, when the quadrupolar moments are ordered in a
staggered fashion, we uncover an elastocaloric response that reflects a
quadratic increase of entropy with antisymmetric strain, analogous to the role
magnetic field plays for Ising antiferromagnets by promoting pseudospin flips.
Our results show that AC elastocaloric effect is a compact and incisive
thermodynamic probe into the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and
strain, which can potentially be applied to broader classes of quantum
materials.

We study binary atomic boson-fermion mixtures confined in one dimensional box
potentials by few-body theory with contact interactions and mean-field
many-body theory with density-density interactions. A variety of correlations
and structures arise as the inter- and intra- species interactions are tuned.
Both few-body and many-body results show that miscible phase and three-chunk
phase separation are directly observable in the density profiles. Meanwhile,
two-chunk phase separation can be inferred from the few-body correlations and
many-body density profiles. We present phase diagrams of selected types of
atomic mixtures to show where different structures survive. The few-body
analysis demonstrates that two-body correlation functions can reveal
information relevant to the results from many-body calculations or experiments.
From the many-body density profiles in the phase-separation regime, we extract
the healing lengths of each species and explain the scaling behavior by an
energy-competition argument.

Despite their recent success, machine learning (ML) models such as graph
neural networks (GNNs), suffer from drawbacks such as the need for large
training datasets and poor performance for unseen cases. In this work, we use
transfer learning (TL) approaches to circumvent the need for retraining with
large datasets. We apply TL to an existing ML framework, trained to predict
multiple crack propagation and stress evolution in brittle materials under
Mode-I loading. The new framework, ACCelerated Universal fRAcTure Emulator
(ACCURATE), is generalized to a variety of crack problems by using a sequence
of TL update steps including (i) arbitrary crack lengths, (ii) arbitrary crack
orientations, (iii) square domains, (iv) horizontal domains, and (v) shear
loadings. We show that using small training datasets of 20 simulations for each
TL update step, ACCURATE achieved high prediction accuracy in Mode-I and
Mode-II stress intensity factors, and crack paths for these problems. %case
studies (i) - (iv). We demonstrate ACCURATE's ability to predict crack growth
and stress evolution with high accuracy for unseen cases involving the
combination of new boundary dimensions with arbitrary crack lengths and crack
orientations in both tensile and shear loading. We also demonstrate
significantly accelerated simulation times of up to 2 orders of magnitude
faster (200x) compared to an XFEM-based fracture model. The ACCURATE framework
provides a universal computational fracture mechanics model that can be easily
modified or extended in future work.

<h3>Renewal equations for single-particle diffusion through a semipermeable  interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12460" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12460</a>

<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
Diffusion through semipermeable interfaces has a wide range of applications,
ranging from molecular transport through biological membranes to reverse
osmosis for water purification using artificial membranes. At the
single-particle level, one-dimensional diffusion through a barrier with
constant permeability $\kappa_0$ can be modeled in terms of so-called snapping
out Brownian motion (BM). The latter sews together successive rounds of
partially reflecting BMs that are restricted to either the left or right of the
barrier. Each round is killed (absorbed) at the barrier when its Brownian local
time exceeds an exponential random variable parameterized by $\kappa_0$. A new
round is then immediately started in either direction with equal probability.
It has recently been shown that the probability density for snapping out BM
satisfies a renewal equation that relates the full density to the probability
densities of partially reflected BM on either side of the barrier. Moreover,
generalized versions of the renewal equation can be constructed that
incorporate non-Markovian, encounter-based models of absorption. In this paper
we extend the renewal theory of snapping out BM to single-particle diffusion in
bounded domains and higher spatial dimensions. We also consider an example of
an asymmetric interface in which the directional switching after each
absorption event is biased. Finally, we show how to incorporate an
encounter-based model of absorption for single-particle diffusion through a
spherically symmetric interface. We find that, even when the same non-Markovian
model of absorption applies on either side of the interface, the resulting
permeability is an asymmetric time-dependent function with memory. Moreover,
the permeability functions tend to be heavy-tailed.

<h3>Diffusion with stochastic resetting screened by a semipermeable  interface</h3>

In this paper we consider the diffusive search for a bounded target $\Omega
\in \R^d$ with its boundary $\partial \Omega$ totally absorbing. We assume that
the target is surrounded by a semipermeable interface given by the closed
surface $\partial \calM$ with $\Omega \subset \calM\subset \R^d$. That is, the
interface totally surrounds the target and thus partially screens the diffusive
search process. We also assume that the position of the diffusing particle
(searcher) randomly resets to its initial position $\x_0$ according to a
Poisson process with a resetting rate $r$. The location $\x_0$ is taken to be
outside the interface, $\x_0\in \calM^c$, which means that resetting does not
occur when the particle is within the interior of $\partial \calM$. Hence, the
semipermeable interface also screens out the effects of resetting. We first
solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for diffusion on the half-line $x\in
[0,\infty)$ with an absorbing boundary at $x=0$, a semipermeable barrier at
$x=L$, and stochastic resetting to $x_0>L$ for all $x>L$. We calculate the mean
first passage time (MFPT) to be absorbed by the target and explore its behavior
as a function of the permeability $\kappa_0$ of the interface and its spatial
position $L$. We then perform the analogous calculations for a
three-dimensional (3D) spherically symmetric interface and target, and show
that the MFPT exhibits the same qualitative behavior as the 1D case. Finally,
we introduce a stochastic single-particle realization of the search process
based on a generalization of so-called snapping out BM. The latter sews
together successive rounds of reflecting Brownian motion on either side of the
interface. The main challenge is establishing that the probability density
generated by the snapping out BM satisfies the permeable boundary conditions at
the interface. We show how this can be achieved using renewal theory.

The recent discovery of nematic liquid crystals with polar order
(ferroelectric nematic) has created immense interest. Despite intensive
research, several physical properties of this liquid crystal are yet to be
investigated and understood. Here, we report experimental studies on the
birefringence and exoelectric coefficient of a polar nematic (NF) liquid
crystal. Our experiments reveal that the splay uctuations in uence the
birefringence several degrees above the nonpolar (N) to polar-nematic (NF)
phase transition temperature and the heat capacity exponent obtained from the
tilt angle uctuations is close to the value reported in adiabatic scanning
calorimetry measurements. The exoelectric coefficient of the nonpolar nematic
phase shows a power-law dependence on temperature. Our experimental results
indicate the possible contribution of growing polar domains to the exoelectric
coefficient as the temperature is decreased.

In this work we study the recently developed parametrized partition function
formulation and show how we can infer the thermodynamic properties of fermions
based on numerical simulation of bosons and distinguishable particles at
various temperatures. In particular, we show that in the three dimensional
space defined by energy, temperature and the parameter characterizing
parametrized partition function, we can map the energies of bosons and
distinguishable particles to fermionic energies through constant-energy
contours. We apply this idea to both noninteracting and interacting Fermi
systems and show it is possible to infer the fermionic energies at all
temperatures, thus providing a practical and efficient approach to obtain
thermodynamic properties of large fermion systems with numerical simulation. As
an example, we present energies for up to 50 noninteracting fermions and up to
20 interacting fermions at all temperatures and show good agreement with the
analytical result for noninteracting case.
