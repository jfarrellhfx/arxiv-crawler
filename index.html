<h3>Proximity-induced charge density wave in a metallic system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12928" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12928</a>

Non-local quasiparticles in correlated quantum materials can exhibit the
proximity effect. For instance, in metal superconductor hybrid systems, the
leaking of cooper pairs to the metallic region induces superconducting
correlations in a standard metal. This paper explores the proximity effects of
charge density wave (CDW) on metal using the attractive Hubbard model, which
harbors CDW state at half-filling. Our fully self-consistent calculations
demonstrate that periodic charge modulations develop in a metal due to the
tunneling of finite momentum particle-hole pairs from the CDW region. Upon
doping the normal region, the commensurate CDW changes to an incommensurate one
by incorporating regular phase shifts. Furthermore, the induced CDW produces a
soft gap in the density of states and thus can be detected in tunneling
experiments. We discuss our results in light of recent reports of such
proximity-induced charge order in different two-dimensional heterostructures.

<h3>Collective dynamics and phase transition of active matter in presence of  orientation adapters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13035" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13035</a>

In this work, the orientation adapter, a species of active particles that
adapt their direction of motion from the other active particles, is introduced.
The orientation adapters exist besides the usual Vicsek-like particles; both
are self-driven, however, follow different interaction rules. We have studied
the dynamics in high speed of the particles keeping dissimilar speeds for these
different species. The effect of orientation adapters on the collective
behaviour of the system is explored in this model. The orientational
order-disorder phase transition is mainly studied in such systems. First, for
equal density of both species, when the adapter speed $v_a=1.2v_0$ and usual
particles speed $v_0=1.0$, both adapters and the usual particles form dense
travelling bands and move in the same direction. Near the transition point,
such bands appear and disappear over time, giving rise to the co-existence of
two phases. The adapters and the usual particles both undergo a discontinuous
transition. The nature of the transition is further confirmed by the existence
of hysteresis in the order parameter under a continuously varying noise field.
However, when the adapter velocity becomes much higher than the usual SPPs $v_a
\approx 7v_0$, the formation of travelling bands disappears from the system,
and the transition becomes continuous. The density ratio is also varied,
keeping the velocities constant, and the phase transition is studied. For a
high adapter velocity with $v_a=10v_0$, the continuous transition is found with
low-density values of the adapters. The critical exponents related to the
continuous transition are also determined.

The electricity-free nature of passive radiative cooling technologies is
highly attractive in pursuing sustainable development. However, current cooling
materials are often static, which makes it difficult to cope with the varying
needs of all-weather and year-round thermal comfort management. Herein, we
demonstrate an electrospinning thermoplastic polyurethane (Es-TPU) membrane,
whose optical properties can be adjusted by simple mechanical stretching to
induce a dynamic adjustment of its thermal management function. The excellent
mechanical properties of the Es-TPU membrane allow to tune its cooling and
heating powers of 118.25 W/m2 and 220.34 W/m2, respectively. In its cooling
state (0% strain), the Es-TPU membrane shows a high and angular-independent
reflectance of 96.0% in the 0.2-2.5 {\mu}m wavelength range and infrared
emissivity (93.3%) in the atmospheric transparency window (8-13 {\mu}m),
reaching a cooling effect of 10 {\deg}C at midday. The excellent mechanical
properties of the Es-TPU membrane allows the continuous adjustment of
reflectivity which can be reduced to 61% ({\Delta}R = 35.0%) when the strain is
80%, leading to a net temperature increase of 9.5 {\deg}C. The strong haze,
hydrophobicity and outstanding aging resistance exhibited by this scalable
membrane hold high promise for achieving uniform illumination with tunable
strength and efficient thermal management in practical application scenarios.

Quantifying and controlling the coherent dynamics and couplings of optically
active excitations in solids is of paramount importance in fundamental research
in condensed matter optics and for their prospective optoelectronic
applications in quantum technologies. Here, we perform ultrafast coherent
nonlinear spectroscopy of a charge-tunable MoSe$_2$ monolayer. The experiments
show that the homogeneous and inhomogeneous line width and the population decay
of exciton complexes hosted by this material can be directly tuned by an
applied gate bias, which governs the Fermi level and therefore the free carrier
density. By performing two-dimensional spectroscopy, we also show that the same
bias-tuning approach permits us to control the coherent coupling strength
between charged and neutral exciton complexes.

<h3>Long-range Velocity Correlations from Active Dopants</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13131" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13131</a>
<br>
<i>Leila Abbaspour, Rituparno Mandal, Peter Sollich, Stefan Klumpp</i>
<br>
<br>
One of the most remarkable observations in dense active matter systems is the
appearance of long-range velocity correlations without any explicit aligning
interaction (of e.g.\ Vicsek type). Here we show that this kind of long range
velocity correlation can also be generated in a dense athermal passive system
by the inclusion of a very small fraction of active Brownian particles. We
develop a continuum theory to explain the emergence of velocity correlations
generated via such active dopants. We validate the predictions for the effects
of magnitude and persistence time of the active force and the area fractions of
active or passive particles using extensive Brownian dynamics simulation of a
canonical active-passive mixture. Our work decouples the roles that density and
activity play in generating long range velocity correlations in such exotic
non-equilibrium steady states.

<h3>Quantum $z=2$ Lifshitz criticality in interacting topological chains</h3>

<br>
We consider Lifshitz criticality (LC) with dynamical critical exponent $z=2$
in the interacting topological chain. We report that interactions have crucial
effects on Lifshitz criticality. We find that repulsive interaction derives the
system to a conformal-invariant criticality and the low-energy excitations are
gapless bosons. We also show that the attractive interaction stabilizes the
$z=2$ LC and excitations are almost free fermions carrying quadratic
dispersion. The stability originates from the strong infrared quantum
fluctuations compensating for the classical relevant perturbation. We perform
numerical simulations to confirm the theoretical predictions and consider
universal behaviors of quantum critical phases. The work paves the way to study
interacting one-dimensional LCs and offers insights into low-dimensional
quantum criticality.

<h3>Quantum theory of the Intrinsic Orbital Magnetoelectric Effect in  itinerant electron systems at finite temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13248" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13248</a>
<br>
<i>Koki Shinada, Akira Kofuji, Robert Peters</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetization can be induced by an electric field in systems without
inversion symmetry $\mathcal{P}$ and time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$. This
phenomenon is called the magnetoelectric (ME) effect. The spin ME effect has
been actively studied in multiferroics. The orbital ME effect also exists and
has been mainly discussed in topological insulators at zero temperature. In
this paper, we study the intrinsic orbital ME response in metals at finite
temperature using the Kubo formula. The intrinsic response originates from the
Fermi sea and does not depend on the dissipation. Especially in systems with
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the extrinsic orbital ME effect becomes zero, and the
intrinsic ME effect is dominant. We apply the response tensor obtained in this
work to a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric model Hamiltonian with antiferromagnetic
loop current order demonstrating that the intrinsic ME effect is enhanced
around the Dirac points.

<h3>Interaction of One-Dimensional Quantum Droplets with Potential Wells and  Barriers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13367" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13367</a>
<br>
<i>Argha Debnath, Ayan Khan, Boris Malomed</i>
<br>
<br>
We address static and dynamical properties of one-dimensional (1D) quantum
droplets (QDs) under the action of local potentials in the form of narrow wells
and barriers. The QDs are governed by the 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation
including the mean-field cubic repulsive term and the beyond-mean-field
attractive quadratic one. In the case of the well represented by the
delta-functional potential, three exact stable solutions are found for
localized states pinned to the well. The Thomas-Fermi approximation for the
well and the adiabatic approximation for the collision of the QD with the
barrier are developed too. Collisions of incident QDs with the wells and
barriers are analyzed in detail by means of systematic simulations. Outcomes,
such as fission of the moving QD into transmitted, reflected, and trapped
fragments, are identified in relevant parameter planes. In particular, a
counter-intuitive effect of partial or full rebound of the incident QD from the
potential well is studied in detail and qualitatively explained.

<h3>The yielding of granular matter is marginally stable and critical</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13569" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13569</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The mechanical yield of dense granular materials is a fascinating rheological
phenomenon, beyond which stress no longer increases with strain at a
sufficiently large deformation. Understanding the behavior of mechanical
responses associated with yielding is a fundamental goal in granular physics,
and other related fields including glassy physics, material sciences,
geophysics, and active matter biophysics. However, despite nearly half a
century of theoretical efforts, the nature of yielding in amorphous solids
remains largely elusive compared to its crystalline counterpart. Here, we
experimentally investigate the mechanical responses of two-dimensional
bidisperse jammed disks subjected to volume-invariant pure shear, focusing on
the behavior of yielding. We show that the microscopic mechanical and
geometrical features of configurations under shear can be characterized by two
critical exponents of weak-force and small-gap distributions originally
proposed for the isotropic jamming transition. We find that the yielding
transition satisfies the condition of marginal mechanical stability through a
scaling relationship between the two exponents, and after yielding global
instability emerges. The criticality of yielding is revealed by a significant
peak of susceptibility that quantifies the fluctuation of a glass overlap order
parameter. Moreover, we find a distinct transition before yielding, which is
associated with the onset of structural anisotropy.

<h3>Evanescent Gels: Competition Between Sticker Dynamics and Single Chain  Relaxation</h3>

Solutions of polymer chains are modelled using non-equilibrium Brownian
dynamics simulations, with physically associative beads which form reversible
crosslinks to establish a system-spanning physical gel network. Rheological
properties such as zero-shear viscosity and relaxation modulus are investigated
systematically as functions of polymer concentration and binding energy between
associative sites. It is shown that a system-spanning network can form
regardless of binding energy at sufficiently high concentration. However, the
contribution to the stress sustained by this physical network can decay faster
than other relaxation processes, even single chain relaxations. If the polymer
relaxation time scales overlap with short-lived associations, the mechanical
response of a gel becomes "evanescent", decaying before it can be rheologically
observed, even though the network is instantaneously mechanically rigid. In our
simulations, the concentration of elastically active chains and the dynamic
modulii are computed independently. This makes it possible to combine
structural and rheological information to identify the concentration at which
the sol-gel transition occurs as a function of binding energy. Further, it is
shown that the competition of scales between the dissociation time and the
single-polymer relaxation time determines if the gel is in the evanescent
regime.

<h3>The three-body scattering hypervolume of identical fermions in one  dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13685</a>
<br>
<i>Zipeng Wang, Shina Tan</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the zero-energy collision of three identical spin-polarized fermions
with short-range interactions in one dimension. We derive the asymptotic
expansions of the three-body wave function when the three fermions are far
apart or one pair and the third fermion are far apart, and the three-body
scattering hypervolume $D_F$ appears in the coefficients of such expansions. If
the two-body interaction is attractive and supports two-body bound states,
$D_F$ acquires a negative imaginary part related to the amplitudes of the
outgoing waves describing the departure of the resultant bound pair and the
remaining free fermion. For weak interaction potentials, we derive an
approximate formula of the hypervolume by using the Born expansion. For the
square-barrier and the square-well potentials and the Gaussian potential, we
solve the three-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation to compute $D_F$ numerically. We
also calculate the shifts of energy and of pressure of spin-polarized
one-dimensional Fermi gases due to a nonzero $D_F$ and the three-body
recombination rate in one dimension.

<h3>Interplay between Brownian and hydrodynamic tracer diffusion in  suspensions of swimming microorganisms</h3>

The general problem of tracer diffusion in non-equilibrium baths is important
in a wide range of systems, from the cellular level to geographical
lengthscales. In this paper, we revisit the archetypical example of such a
system: a collection of small passive particles immersed in a dilute suspension
of non-interacting dipolar microswimmers, representing bacteria or algae. In
particular, we consider the interplay between thermal (Brownian) diffusion and
hydrodynamic (active) diffusion due to the persistent advection of tracers by
microswimmer flow fields. Previously, it has been argued that even a moderate
amount of Brownian diffusion is sufficient to significantly reduce the
persistence time of tracer advection, leading to a significantly reduced value
of the effective active diffusion coefficient $D_A$ compared to the
non-Brownian case. Here, we show by large-scale simulations and kinetic theory
that this effect is in fact only practically relevant for microswimmers that
effectively remain stationary while still stirring up the surrounding fluid,
so-called \emph{shakers}. In contrast, for moderate and high values of the
swimming speed $v_s$, relevant for biological microswimmer suspensions, the
effect of Brownian motion on $D_A$ is negligible, leading to the effects of
advection by microswimmers and Brownian motion being additive. This conclusion
contrasts with previous results from the literature, and encourages a
reinterpretation of recent experimental measurements of $D_A$ for tracer
particles of varying size in bacterial suspensions.

<h3>Effects of the self-propulsion parity on the efficiency of a  fuel-consuming active heat engine</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13870" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13870</a>
<br>
<i>Yongjae Oh, Yongjoo Baek</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a thermodynamically consistent, analytically tractable model of
steady-state active heat engines driven by both temperature difference and a
constant chemical driving. While the engine follows the dynamics of the Active
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Particle, its self-propulsion stems from the mechanochemical
coupling with the fuel consumption dynamics, allowing for both even- and
odd-parity self-propulsion forces. Using the standard methods of stochastic
thermodynamics, we show that the entropy production of the engine satisfies the
conventional Clausius relation, based on which we define the efficiency of the
model that is bounded from above by the second law of thermodynamics. Using
this framework, we obtain exact expressions for the efficiency at maximum
power. The results show that the engine performance has a nonmonotonic
dependence on the magnitude of the chemical driving, and that the even-parity
(odd-parity) engines perform better when the size of the engine is smaller
(larger) than the persistence length of the active particle. We also discuss
the existence of a tighter upper bound on the efficiency of the odd-parity
engines stemming from the detailed structure of the entropy production.

<h3>Hydrodynamic instabilities in a 2-D sheet of microswimmers embedded in a  3-D fluid</h3>

A collection of microswimmers immersed in an incompressible fluid is
characterised by strong interactions due to the long-range nature of the
hydrodynamic fields generated by individual organisms. As a result, suspensions
of rear-actuated `pusher' swimmers such as bacteria exhibit a collective motion
state often referred to as `bacterial turbulence', characterised by large-scale
chaotic flows. The onset of collective motion in pusher suspensions is
classically understood within the framework of mean-field kinetic theories for
dipolar swimmers. In bulk 2-D and 3-D, the theory predicts that the instability
leading to bacterial turbulence is due to mutual swimmer reorientation and sets
in at the largest length scale available to the suspension. Here, we construct
a similar kinetic theory for the case of a dipolar microswimmer suspension
confined to a two-dimensional plane embedded in a three-dimensional
incompressible fluid. This setting qualitatively mimics the effect of swimming
close to a two-dimensional interface. We show that the in-plane flow fields are
effectively compressible in spite of the incompressibility of the 3-D bulk
fluid. We analyse stability of the homogeneous and isotropic state, and find
two types of instability that are qualitatively different from the bulk,
three-dimensional case: First, we show that the analogue of the orientational
pusher instability leading to bacterial turbulence in bulk systems instead
occurs at the smallest length-scale available to the system. Second, an
instability associated with density variations arises in puller suspensions as
a generic consequence of the effective in-plane compressibility. Given these
qualitative differences with respect to the standard bulk setting we conclude
that confinement can have a crucial role in determining the collective
behaviour of microswimmer suspensions.

<h3>Close encounters of the sticky kind: Brownian motion at absorbing  boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13986</a>

<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>

Encounter-based models of diffusion provide a probabilistic framework for
analyzing the effects of a partially absorbing reactive surface, in which the
probability of absorption depends upon the amount of surface-particle contact
time. Prior to absorption, the surface is typically assumed to act as a totally
reflecting boundary, which means that the contact time is determined by a
Brownian functional known as the boundary local time. In this paper we develop
a class of encounter-based models that deal with absorption at sticky
boundaries. Sticky boundaries occur in a diverse range of applications,
including cell biology, colloidal physics, active matter, finance, and human
crowd dynamics. We begin by constructing a one-dimensional encounter-based
model of sticky Brownian motion (BM), which is based on the zero-range limit of
non-sticky BM with a short-range attractive potential well near the origin. In
this limit, the boundary-contact time is given by the amount of time
(occupation time) that the particle spends at the origin. We calculate the
joint probability density or propagator for the particle position and the
occupation time, and then identify an absorption event as the first time that
the occupation time crosses a randomly generated threshold. Different models of
absorption correspond to different choices for the random threshold probability
distribution. We illustrate the theory by considering diffusion in a finite
interval with a partially absorbing sticky boundary at one end. We show how
various quantities of interest depend on moments of the random threshold
distribution. Finally, we determine how sticky BM can be obtained by taking a
particular diffusion limit of a sticky run-and-tumble particle (RTP). The
diffusion limit is well-defined provided that the velocity of the RTP is biased
and spatially varying within a boundary layer around the origin.

The performance of electron energy-loss spectrometers can often be limited by
their electron-optical aberrations. Due to recent developments in high
energy-resolution and momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS), there is renewed interest in optimizing the performance of such
spectrometers. For example, the "{\omega}-q" mode of momentum-resolved EELS,
which uses a small convergence angle and requires aligning diffraction spots
with a slot aperture, presents a challenge for realigning the spectrometer
after adjusting the projection lenses. Automated and robust alignment can
greatly benefit such a process. The first step towards this goal is automatic
and quantitative measurement of spectrometer aberrations. Here we demonstrate
the measurement of geometric aberrations and distortions in EELS within a
monochromated scanning transmission electron microscope(STEM). To better
understand the results, we present a wave mechanical simulation of the
experiment. Using the measured aberration and distortion coefficients as inputs
to the simulation, we find a good match between the simulation and experiment,
verifying the approach used in the simulation, allowing us to assess the
accuracy of the measurements. Understanding the errors and inaccuracies in the
procedure can guide further progress in aberration measurement and correction
for new spectrometer developments.

<h3>Range and strength of mechanical interactions of force dipoles in  elastic fiber networks</h3>

Mechanical forces generated by myosin II molecular motors drive diverse
cellular processes, most notably shape change, division and locomotion. These
forces may be transmitted over long range through the cytoskeletal medium - a
disordered, viscoelastic network of biopolymers. The resulting cell size scale
force chains can in principle mediate mechanical interactions between distant
actomyosin units, leading to self-organized structural order in the cell
cytoskeleton. To investigate this process, we model the actin cytoskeleton on a
percolated fiber lattice network, where fibers are modeled as linear elastic
elements that can both bend and stretch, whereas myosin motors exert
contractile force dipoles. We quantify the range and heterogeneity of force
transmission in these networks in response to a force dipole, showing how these
depend on varying bond dilution and fiber bending-to-stretching stiffness
ratio. By analyzing clusters of nodes connected to highly strained bonds, as
well as the decay rate of strain energy with distance from the force dipole, we
show that long-range force transmission is screened out by fiber bending in
diluted networks. We further characterize the difference in the propagation of
tensile and compressive forces. This leads to a dependence of the mechanical
interaction between a pair of force dipoles on their mutual separation and
orientation. In more homogeneous networks, the interaction between force
dipoles recapitulates the power law dependence on separation distance predicted
by continuum elasticity theory, while in diluted networks, the interactions are
short-ranged and fluctuate strongly with local network configurations.
Altogether, our work suggests that elastic interactions between force dipoles
in disordered, fibrous media can act as an organizing principle in biological
materials.

<h3>Individual bias and fluctuations in collective decision making: from  algorithms to Hamiltonians</h3>

In this paper, we reconsider the spin model suggested recently to understand
some features of collective decision making among higher organisms [A.T.
Hartnett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 038701]. Within the model, the
state of an agent $i$ is described by the pair of variables corresponding to
its opinion $S_i=\pm 1$ and a bias $\omega_i$ towards any of the opposing
values of $S_i$. Collective decision making is interpreted as an approach to
the equilibrium state within the non-linear voter model subject to a social
pressure and a probabilistic algorithm. Here, we push such physical analogy
further and give the statistical physics interpretation of the model,
describing it in terms of the Hamiltonian of interaction and looking for the
equilibrium state via explicit calculation of its partition function. We show
that depending on the assumptions about the nature of social interactions two
different Hamiltonians can be formulated, which can be solved with different
methods. In such an interpretation the temperature serves as a measure of
fluctuations, not considered before in the original model. We find exact
solutions for the thermodynamics of the model on the complete graph. The
general analytical predictions are confirmed using individual-based
simulations. The simulations allow us also to study the impact of system size
and initial conditions in the collective decision making in finite-sized
systems, in particular with respect to convergence to metastable states.

Realization of large and highly tunable second-order nonlinear optical (NLO)
responses, e.g., second-harmonic generation (SHG) and bulk photovoltaic effect
(BPVE), is critical for developing modern optical and optoelectronic devices.
Very recently, the two-dimensional van der Waals ferroelectric NbOX2 (X = Cl,
Br or I) are discovered to exhibit unusually large and anisotropic SHG.
However, the physical origin and possible tunability of NLO responses in NbOX2
remain to be unclear. In this article, we reveal that the large SHG in NbOCl2
is dominated by the synergy between large transition dipole moment and
band-nesting-induced large intensity of electron-hole pairs. Remarkably, the
NbOCl2 can exhibit dramatically different strain-dependent BPVE under different
polarized light, originating from the interesting light-polarization-dependent
orbital transition. Importantly, we successfully achieve a reversible
ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric phase transition via controlling ambient
temperature or external pressure, accompanied by the greatly tunable NLO
responses. Furthermore, we discover that the evolutions of SHG and BPVE in
NbOX2 with variable X obey different rules. Our study provides a deep
understanding on the novel NLO physics in NbOX2 and establishes great
external-field tunability for device applications.

The duality between electric and magnetic dipoles in electromagnetism only
partly applies to condensed matter. In particular, the elementary excitations
of the magnetic and ferroelectric orders, namely magnons and ferrons,
respectively, have received asymmetric attention from the condensed matter
community in the past. In this perspective, we introduce and summarize the
current state of the budding field of "ferronics" and speculate about its

<h3>The Isotope Effect and Critical Magnetic Fields of Superconducting  YH$_{6}$: A Migdal-Eliashberg Theory Approach</h3>

<br>
<br>
The emergence of near-ambient temperature superconductivity under pressure in
the metal hydride systems has motivated a desire to further understand such
remarkable properties, specifically critical magnetic fields. YH$_6$ is
suggested to be a departure from conventional superconductivity, due to
apparent anomalous behavior. Using density functional calculations in
conjunction with Migdal-Eliashberg theory we show that in YH$_6$ the critical
temperature and the isotope effect under pressure, as well as the high critical
fields, are consistent with strong-coupling conventional superconductivity; a
property anticipated to extend to other related systems. Furthermore, the
strong-coupling corrections occur to the expected BCS values for the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter ($\kappa_{1}(T)$), London penetration depth
($\lambda_{L}(T)$), electromagnetic coherence length ($\xi(T)$), and the energy
gap ($\Delta_{0}$).

This work examines challenges associated with the accuracy of machine-learned
force fields (MLFFs) for bulk solid and liquid phases of d-block elements. In
exhaustive detail, we contrast the performance of force, energy, and stress
predictions across the transition metals for two leading MLFF models: a
kernel-based atomic cluster expansion method implemented using Gaussian
processes (FLARE), and an equivariant message-passing neural network (NequIP).
Early transition metals present higher relative errors and are more difficult
to learn relative to late platinum- and coinage-group elements, and this trend
persists across model architectures. The underlying physical and chemical
differences in the complexity of interatomic interactions for different metals
are revealed via comparison of the performance of representations with
different many-body order and angular resolution. This work illustrates
challenges in capturing intricate properties of metallic bonding with currently
leading MLFFs and provides a reference data set for transition metals, aimed at
benchmarking and development of emerging machine-learned approximations.

A strongly-correlated insulator, samarium mono-sulfide (SmS), presents not
only the pressure-induced insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) with the color
change from black to golden-yellow but also current-induced IMT (CIMT) with
negative resistance. To clarify the origin of the CIMT of SmS, the electronic
structure change has been investigated by optical reflectivity and
angle-integrated photoelectron spectra by applying an electric current. At
lower temperatures than about 100 K, where the nonlinear $V$-$I$ curve has been
observed, the carrier density rapidly increases, accompanied by decreasing
relaxation time of carriers with increasing current. Then, the direct gap size
increases, and the mean valence changes from Sm$^{2+}$-dominant SmS to the
mixed-valent one with increasing current. These results suggest that the CIMT
originates from increasing the Sm $4f$-$5d$ hybridization intensity induced by
the applied current.

<br>
<br>
Localized interlayer excitons (LIXs) in two-dimensional moir\'e superlattices
exhibit sharp and dense emission peaks, making them promising as highly tunable
single-photon sources. However, the fundamental nature of these LIXs is still
elusive. Here, we show the donor-acceptor pair (DAP) mechanism as one of the
origins of these excitonic peaks. Numerical simulation results of the DAP model
agree with the experimental photoluminescence spectra of LIX in the moir\'e
MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer. In particular, we find that the emission
energy-lifetime correlation and the nonmonotonic power dependence of the
lifetime agree well with the DAP IX model. Our results provide insight into the
physical mechanism of LIX formation in moir\'e heterostructures and pave new
directions for engineering interlayer exciton properties in moir\'e
superlattices.

<br>
<br>
We use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to study Josephson tunneling between two
weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), which compose spin-1 bosons.
We show that a rotating magnetic field on one side can produce a phase
difference across the junction, resulting in an oscillatory tunneling spin
current. Besides numerical calculation, we derive analytical results in two
extreme cases, namely the low- and high-frequency limits: In the low-frequency
limit (magnetic field rotates adiabatically), a non-abelian geometric phase
arises and leads to the oscillatory spin current. By sharp contrast, the
physics is intrinsically different in the high-frequency limit, where an
average Zeeman energy difference leads to an oscillatory spin current. This
proposed apparatus should be promising for the future experimental search of
spin superfluidity.

Real-space self-interaction corrected (time-dependent) density functional
theory has been used to investigate the ground-state electronic structure and
optical absorption profiles of a series of linear oligomers inspired by the
natural product telomestatin. Length-dependent development of plasmonic
excitations in the UV region is seen in the neutral species which is augmented
by polaron-type absorption in the IR when the chains are doped with an
additional electron/hole. Combined with a lack of absorption in the visible
region this suggests these oligomers as good candidates for applications such
as transparent antennae in dye-sensitised solar energy collection materials.

<br>
TiSe2 has received much attention among the transition metals chalcogenides
because of its thrilling physical properties concerning atypical resistivity
behavior, emerging of charge density wave (CDW) state, induced
superconductivity etc. Here, we report discovery of new feature of TiSe2,
namely, observation of resistive switching in voltage biased point contacts
(PCs) based on TiSe2 and its derivatives doped by S and Cu (TiSeS, CuxTiSe2).
The switching is taking place between a low resistive mainly metallic-type
state and a high resistive semiconducting-type state by applying bias voltage
(usually below 0.5V), while reverse switching takes place by applying voltage
of opposite polarity (usually below 0.5V). The difference in resistance between
these two states can reach up to two orders of magnitude at the room
temperature. The origin of the effect can be attributed to the variation of
stoichiometry in PC core due to drift/displacement of Se/Ti vacancies under
high electric field. Additionally, we demonstrated, that heating takes place in
PC core, which can facilitate the electric field induced effect. At the same
time, we did not found any evidence for CDW spectral features in our PC spectra
for TiSe2. The observed resistive switching allows to propose TiSe2 and their
derivatives as the promising materials, e.g., for non-volatile resistive random
access memory (ReRAM) engineering.

The real Chern insulator state, featuring nontrivial real Chern number and
second-order boundary modes, has been revealed in a few two-dimensional
systems. The concept can be extended to three dimensions (3D), but a proper
material realization is still lacking. Here, based on first-principles
calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify the recently synthesized
bulk ${\gamma}$-graphyne as a 3D real Chern insulator. Its nontrivial bulk
topology leads to topological hinge modes spreading across the 1D edge
Brillouin zone. Under compression of the interlayer distance, the system can
undergo a topological phase transition into a real nodal-line semimetal, which
hosts three bulk nodal rings and topological boundary modes on both surfaces
and hinges. We also develop a minimal model which captures essential physics of
the system.

<br>
We analyze the performance of the least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator (Lasso) for the linear model when the number of regressors $N$ grows
larger keeping the true support size $d$ finite, i.e., the ultra-sparse case.
The result is based on a novel treatment of the non-rigorous replica method in
statistical physics, which has been applied only to problem settings where $N$
,$d$ and the number of observations $M$ tend to infinity at the same rate. Our
analysis makes it possible to assess the average performance of Lasso with
Gaussian sensing matrices without assumptions on the scaling of $N$ and $M$,
the noise distribution, and the profile of the true signal. Under mild
conditions on the noise distribution, the analysis also offers a lower bound on
the sample complexity necessary for partial and perfect support recovery when
$M$ diverges as $M = O(\log N)$. The obtained bound for perfect support
recovery is a generalization of that given in previous literature, which only
considers the case of Gaussian noise and diverging $d$. Extensive numerical
experiments strongly support our analysis.

Rydberg atom arrays offer promising platforms for quantum simulation of
correlated quantum matter and raise great interests. Here we propose a novel
stripe-lattice model with Raman superarray of Rydberg atoms to realize
fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) phase. We implement two types of
Rydberg states, arranged in a supperarray configuration and with Raman-assisted
dipole-exchange couplings, to realize a minimal QAH model for hard-core bosons
populated into a topological flat band with large bulk gap under proper tunable
experimental condition. With this the FQAH phase can be further achieved and
probed feasibly. In particular, we propose a novel quench protocol to probe the
fractionalized excitations by measuring the correlated quench dynamics featured
by fractional charge tunneling between bulk and chiral edge modes in the open
boundary.

<br>
<br>
We use ab initio calculations and theoretical analysis to investigate the
influence of in-plane strain field on valley drifts and Berry curvatures in the
monolayer MoSi$_2$N$_4$, a prototypical septuple atomic layered two-dimensional
material. The low energy electron and hole valleys drift far off the K/K' point
under uniaxial strains. The direction and strength of valley drift strongly
depend on the nature of the charge carrier and uniaxial strain with a more
substantial response along the zigzag path. Our findings are governed by the
interplay between microscopic orbital contribution and symmetry lowering. The
changing geometric properties of Bloch states affect the Berry curvatures and
circular dichroism. Specifically, Berry curvature dipole is significantly
enhanced under the tensile strain along armchair and zigzag directions.
Meanwhile, the particle-hole asymmetry arising from non-equivalent electron and
hole valley drifts relax the selection rules, thus reducing the degree of
circular polarization up to ~0.98. Therefore, strain engineering of valley
physics in the monolayer MoSi$_2$N$_4$ is of prime importance for
valleytronics.

<br>
<br>
Ferromagnetic ground states have often been overlooked in comparison to
seemingly more interesting antiferromagnetic ground states. However, both the
physical and mathematical structure of ferromagnetic ground states are
particularly rich. We show that the highly degenerate and highly entangled
ground states of the ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model are scale
invariant, originating from spontaneous symmetry breaking from ${\rm SU}(3)$ to
${\rm U}(1)\times {\rm U}(1)$ with two type-B Goldstone modes. The ground state
degeneracies are characterized as the Fibonacci-Lucas sequences -- an ancient
mathematical gem, under open and periodic boundary conditions, with the
residual entropy being non-zero. This implies that the ground state
degeneracies for this model are asymptotically the golden spiral. In addition,
sequences of degenerate ground states generated from highest and generalized
highest weight states are constructed to establish that the entanglement
entropy scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit,
with the prefactor being half the number of type-B Goldstone modes. The latter
in turn is identified to be the fractal dimension.

<h3>Correlation between phase stiffness and condensation energy across the  non-Fermi to Fermi-liquid crossover in the Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model on  a lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
We construct and analyze a lattice generalization of the
Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, where spinful fermions experience on-site,
random, all-to-all interactions with an Einstein bosonic mode, and random
intersite coherent hopping. We obtain the exact self-consistent numerical
solution of the model at mean-field level, and analytical approximations, for
all values of fermion-boson coupling and hopping, under the spin-singlet ansatz
and at particle-hole symmetry, both in the normal and superconducting states,
thus tracing the entire phase diagram. In the normal state, the competition
between hopping and coupling leads to crossovers between Fermi-liquid and
non-Fermi liquid states, as reflected by the fermionic and bosonic spectral
functions and the normal-state entropy. We calculate the finite phase stiffness
of the superconducting state through the equilibrium electromagnetic response.
Furthermore, we study the critical temperature $T_c$, as well as the spectral
functions, the quasiparticle weight, the gap, and the condensation energy in
the superconducting state. At weak coupling, we retrieve a disordered
generalization of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. At strong coupling,
asymptotically $T_c$ saturates but the stiffness decreases, which suggests
strong superconducting fluctuations. $T_c$ is maximum in the single-dot limit,
while the stiffness peaks exactly at the crossover between non-Fermi liquid and
Fermi-liquid phases. We discover that the quasiparticle weight, the stiffness,
and the condensation energy, are all correlated as a function of coupling,
reminiscent of the correlations observed in high-temperature cuprate
superconductors.

analyze the entire crossover from BCS/weak-coupling to Eliashberg/strong
coupling superconductivity, as a function of fermion-boson interaction strength
and hopping parameter. Cooper pairs of sharp Fermi-liquid quasiparticles at
weak coupling evolve into pairing of fully incoherent fermions in the non-Fermi
liquid regime. The crossovers leave observable traces in the critical
temperature, the zero-temperature and zero-energy gap, the entropy, and the
phase stiffness.

As primarily an electronic observable, the room-temperature thermopower $S$
in cuprates provides possibilities for a quantitative assessment of the Hubbard
model. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we demonstrate agreement between
Hubbard model calculations and experimentally measured room-temperature $S$
across multiple cuprate families, both qualitatively in terms of the doping
dependence and quantitatively in terms of magnitude. We observe an upturn in
$S$ with decreasing temperatures, which possesses a slope comparable to that
observed experimentally in cuprates. From our calculations, the doping at which
$S$ changes sign occurs in close proximity to a vanishing temperature
dependence of the chemical potential at fixed density. Our results emphasize
the importance of interaction effects in the systematic assessment of the
thermopower $S$ in cuprates.

Altermagnetism is a magnetic phase with highly anisotropic spin-splitting of
particular symmetries but zero net magnetization and offers a promising
platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. We study Cooper
pairing in an altermagnetic metal in proximity to conventional $s$-wave
superconductors. Remarkably, we find that the Cooper pairs induced in the
altermagnet acquire a finite momentum, despite the \textit{zero} net
magnetization in the system. Such Cooper-pair momentum is strongly dependent on
the direction of Cooper-pair propagation and exhibits unusual symmetric
patterns. It gives rise to oscillations of the order parameter with the doping
in the altermagnet and/or with the distance from the superconductor, which
depend on the junction orientation. These manifest as 0-$\pi$ transitions in
planar Josephson junctions as a function of doping, junction length or
orientation. Furthermore, we find that in junctions parallel to the crystalline
axis, the superconducting transport is dominated by Cooper pairs moving at
large oblique angles away from the junction direction, an effect not seen in
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems. We discuss the implementation of
our predictions in the candidate material RuO$_{2}$.

Hopfions are localized and topologically non-trivial magnetic configurations
that have received considerable attention in recent years. Through a
micromagnetic approach, we analyze the scattering of spin waves by magnetic
hopfions. We show that the spin waves experience an emergent electromagnetic
field related to the topological properties of the hopfion. We find that spin
waves propagating along the hopfion symmetry axis are deflected by the magnetic
texture, which acts as a convergent or divergent lens, depending on the spin
wave propagation direction. The effect differs for spin waves propagating along
the plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis. In the last case, they respond
with a skew scattering and a closely related Aharonov-Bohm effect. This allows
probing the existence of a magnetic hopfion by magnonic holography.

<h3>Diffusion of oxygen vacancies formed at the anatase (101) surface: An  activation-relaxation technique study</h3>

<br>

TiO2 is a technologically important material. In particular, its anatase
polymorph plays a major role in photocatalysis, which can also accommodate
charged and neutral vacancies. There is, however, scant theoretical work on the
vacancy charge and associated diffusion from surface to subsurface and bulk in
the literature. Here, we aim to understand +2 charge and neutral vacancy
diffusion on anatase (101) surface using 72 and 216 atoms surface slabs
employing a semi-local density functional and the Hubbard model. The
activation-relaxation technique nouveau (ARTn) coupled with Quantum Espresso is
used to investigate the activated mechanisms responsible for the diffusion of
oxygen vacancies. The small slab model over-stabilizes the +2 charged topmost
surface vacancy, which is attributed to the strong Coulomb repulsion between
vacancy and neighboring Ti+4 ions. The larger slab allows atoms to relax
parallel to the surface, decreasing the +2 charged topmost surface vacancy
stability. The calculated surface-to-subsurface barriers for the +2 charged
vacancy and diffusion of the neutral vacancy on a slab of 216 atoms are 0.82 eV
and 0.52 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the bulk vacancy prefers to migrate
toward the subsurface with relatively low activation barriers 0.19 eV and 0.27
eV and the reverse process has to overcome 0.38 eV and 0.40 eV barriers for the
+2 charged and the neutral vacancies. This explains the experimentally observed
high concentration of vacancies at the subsurface sites rather than in the
bulk, and the dynamic diffusion of vacancies from the bulk to the subsurface
and from the subsurface to the bulk is highly likely on the surface of anatase
(101). Finally, we provide a plausible explanation for the origin of recently
observed subsurface-to-surface diffusion of oxygen vacancy from the calculated
results.

The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) refers to that an extensive number of
eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system are localized in open boundaries. Here we
predict a universal phenomenon that with local particle-hole(-like) symmetry
(PHS) the skin modes must be equally distributed on different boundaries,
manifesting a novel nonlocalization of the local PHS, which is unique to
non-Hermitian systems. We develop a generic theory for the emergent nonlocal
symmetry-protected NHSE by connecting the non-Hermitian system to an extended
Hermitian Hamiltonian in a quadruplicate Hilbert space, which maps the skin
modes to the topological zero modes and the PHS to an emergent nonlocal
symmetry in the perspective of many body physics. The predicted NHSE is robust
against perturbations. We propose optical Raman lattice models to observe the
predicted phenomena in all physical dimensions, which are accessible with
cold-atom experiments.

Topological band theory establishes a standardized framework for classifying
different types of topological matters. Recent investigations have shown that
hyperbolic lattices in non-Euclidean space can also be characterized by
hyperbolic Bloch theorem. This theory promotes the investigation of hyperbolic
band topology, where hyperbolic topological band insulators protected by first
Chern numbers have been proposed. Here, we report a new finding on the
construction of hyperbolic topological band insulators with a vanished first
Chern number but a non-trivial second Chern number. Our model possesses the
non-abelian translational symmetry of {8,8} hyperbolic tiling. By engineering
intercell couplings and onsite potentials of sublattices in each unit cell, the
non-trivial bandgaps with quantized second Chern numbers can appear. In
experiments, we fabricate two types of finite hyperbolic circuit networks with

Intrinsic exchange bias up to 12.6 kOe is observed in
NixCoyFe3-x-yO4(111)/{\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) (0<=x+y<=3) epitaxial thin films
where 0.15<=y<=2. An interfacial layer of rock-salt structure emerges between
NixCoyFe3-x-yO4 thin films and {\alpha}-Al2O3 substrates and is proposed as the
antiferromagnetic layer unidirectionally coupled with ferrimagnetic
NixCoyFe3-x-yO4. In NiCo2O4(111)/{\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) films, results of
reflection high energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
X-ray reflectometry, and polarized neutron reflectometry support that the
interfacial layer is antiferromagnetic NixCo1-xO (0.32<=x<=0.49) of rock-salt
structure; the interfacial layer and exchange bias can be controlled by growth
oxygen pressure revealing the key role of oxygen in the mechanism of the
interfacial reconstruction. This work establishes a family of intrinsic
exchange bias materials with great tunability by stoichiometry and growth
parameters and emphasizes the strategy of interface engineering in controlling
material functionalities.

<h3>Microscopic mechanism of ultrashort-pulse laser ablation of metals: a  molecular dynamics study incorporating electronic entropy effects</h3>

The microscopic mechanism of metal ablation induced by ultrashort laser pulse
irradiation is investigated. A two-temperature model scheme combined with
molecular dynamics (TTM-MD) is developed to incorporate electronic entropy
effects into the simulation of metal ablation while satisfying the energy
conservation law. Simulation with the TTM-MD scheme reveals that ultrashort
laser pulse irradiation near the ablation threshold causes high-energy ion
emission and sub-nanometer depth ablation, as observed experimentally, due to
the electronic entropy effect. It is also shown that the electronic entropy
effect is also significant in spallation.

To probe the peculiar excitations spinons and magnetic monopoles in the
quantum spin ice candidate Pr2Zr2O7, we studied the low-temperature thermal
Hall conductivity (\k{appa}xy) and thermal conductivity (\k{appa}xx) of
Pr2Zr2O7 single crystal with magnetic fields applied along the [111] axis. The
magnetic field dependencies of \k{appa}xx suggest the roles of magnetic
excitations in thermal conductivity, that is, the emergent magnetic monopoles
can transport heat at T > 1.4 K and spinons mainly scatter phonons at lower
temperatures. The finite \k{appa}xy was observed at low fields of several Tesla
and was discussed to be related to the magnetic excitations, including magnetic
monopoles as well as spinons.

By harvesting a wider range of the solar spectrum, intermediate band solar
cells (IBSCs) can achieve efficiencies 50% higher than conventional
single-junction solar cells. For this, additional requirements are imposed to
the light-absorbing semiconductor, which must contain a collection of in-gap
levels, called intermediate band (IB), optically coupled to but thermally
decoupled from the valence and conduction bands (VB and CB).
Quantum-dot-in-perovskite (QDiP) solids, where inorganic quantum dots (QDs) are
embedded in a halide perovskite matrix, have been recently suggested as a
promising material platform for developing IBSCs. In this work, QDiP solids
with excellent morphological and structural quality and strong absorption and
emission related to the presence of in-gap QD levels are synthesized. With
them, QDiP-based IBSCs are fabricated and, by means of temperature-dependent
photocurrent measurements, it is shown that the IB is strongly thermally
decoupled from the valence and conduction bands. The activation energy of the
IB$\rightarrow$CB thermal escape of electrons is measured to be 204 meV,
resulting in the mitigation of this detrimental process even under
room-temperature operation, thus fulfilling the first mandatory requisite to
enable high-efficiency IBSCs.

The competition between magnetic order and Kondo effect is essential for the
rich physics of heavy fermion systems. Nevertheless, how such competition is
manifested in the quasiparticle bands in a real periodic lattice remains
elusive in spectroscopic experiments. Here we report a high-resolution
photoemission study of the antiferromagnetic Kondo lattice system CeCoGe3 with
a high TN1 of 21K. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive 4f band at the
Fermi level near the Z point, arisingfrom moderate Kondo effect. The intensity
of this heavy 4f band exhibits a logarithmic increase with lowering temperature
and begins to deviate from this Kondo-like behavior below 25 K, just above TN1,
and eventually ceases to grow below 12 K. Our work provides direct
spectroscopic evidence for the competition between magnetic order and the Kondo
effect in a Kondo lattice system with local-moment antiferromagnetism,
indicating a distinct scenario for the microscopic coexistence and competition
of these phenomena, which might be related to the real-space modulation.

Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are emergent non-equilibrium phases of
periodically driven many-body systems, with potential applications ranging from
quantum computing to sensing and metrology. There has been significant recent
interest in understanding mechanisms leading to DTC formation and a search for
novel DTC phases beyond subharmonic entrainment. Here, we report observation of
multiple DTC phases in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) based on coupled
graphene and silicon nitride membranes. We confirm the time-crystalline nature
of these symmetry broken phases by establishing their many-body characters,
long-range time and spatial order, and rigidity against parameter fluctuation
or noise. Furthermore, we employ controlled mechanical strain to drive the
transitions between phases with different symmetries, thereby mapping the
emergent time-crystalline phase diagram. Overall, our work takes a step towards
establishing time crystals as a system with complexity rivaling that of solid
state crystals.

Using first-principles electronic structure calculations, we have extensively
studied the electronic and magnetic properties of alkali sodium superoxide
(NaO2) in comparison with that of potassium superoxide (KO2) both at high and
low temperatures. These properties of these superoxides are governed by the
unpaired electron donated by the alkali atoms Na and K to the O atoms forming
dimers. This unpaired electron is the source of orbital fluctuations in the
O-{\pi}* manifold for both cases. In order to reduce this orbital fluctuation,
both go through several structural phase transitions. In these plethora of
structures, the O2- dimers undergo rotation, leading to a complex linking of
its orbital degrees of freedom with its spin degrees of freedom. Hence the
magnetic properties are found to be controlled by this unpaired electron vary
as the orientations of these O2 - dimers change. Due to the change in the
orientations of O2- dimers, the alkali ion cages around the O2 - dimers change
from square in the pyrite phase to rhombus and rectangle for the orthorhombic
phase for NaO2 and square in the tetragonal phase to parallelogram in the
monoclinic phase for KO2 on the plane cutting through the dimers. The band
structures of NaO2 in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase and KO2 in the
monoclinic phase show that the lifting of degeneracy in the O-{\pi}* manifold
is due to the redefined electrostatic interaction between the K/Na cages and
the O2 - dimers. This, inaddition to electron correlation among the localized
O-{\pi}* electrons, establishes complete orbital ordering (OO) in turn drives
metal-insulator transition (MIT) in both the systems. Furthermore, K doping for
Na in NaO2 also results in correlation-induced MIT, predicted to take place at
a temperature higher than that in NaO2. This opens up the possibility of MIT in
Rb/Cs-doped NaO2 at even higher temperatures.

Identifying the magnetic state of materials is of great interest in a wide
range of applications, but direct identification is not always straightforward
due to limitations in neutron scattering experiments. In this work, we present
a machine-learning approach using decision-tree algorithms to identify
magnetism from the spin-integrated excitation spectrum, such as the density of
states. The dataset was generated by Hartree-Fock mean-field calculations of
candidate antiferromagnetic orders on a Wannier Hamiltonian, extracted from
first-principle calculations targeting \boo. Our machine learning model was
trained using various types of spectral data, including local density of
states, momentum-resolved density of states at high-symmetry points, and the
lowest excitation energies from the Fermi level. Although the density of states
shows good performance for machine learning, the broadening method had a
significant impact on the model's performance. We improved the model's
performance by designing the excitation energy as a feature for machine
learning, resulting in excellent classification of antiferromagnetic order,
even for test samples generated by different methods from the training samples
used for machine learning.

Quantum simulations of the Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) at commensurate filling
can follow spreading of correlations after a sudden quench for times long
enough to estimate their propagation velocities. In this work we perform tensor
network simulation of the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) ramp from the Mott towards
the superfluid phase in the square lattice BHM and demonstrate that even
relatively short ramp/quench times allow one to test the power laws predicted
by the KZ mechanism (KZM). They can be verified for the correlation length and
the excitation energy but the most reliable test is based on the KZM scaling
hypothesis for the single particle correlation function: the correlation
functions for different quench times evaluated at the same scaled time collapse
to the same scaling function of the scaled distance. The scaling of the space
and time variables is done according to the KZ power laws.

Composite materials with 3D architectures are desirable in a variety of
applications for the capability of tailoring their properties to meet multiple
functional requirements. By the arrangement of materials' internal components,
structure design is of great significance in tuning the properties of the
composites. However, most of the composite structures are proposed by empirical
designs following existing patterns. Hindered by the complexity of 3D
structures, it is hard to extract customized structures with multiple desired
properties from large design space. Here we report a multi-objective driven
Wasserstein generative adversarial network (MDWGAN) to implement inverse
designs of 3D composite structures according to given geometrical, structural
and mechanical requirements. Our framework consists a GAN based network which
generates 3D composite structures possessing with similar geometrical and
structural features to the target dataset. Besides, multiple objectives are
introduced to our framework for the control of mechanical property and isotropy
of the composites. Real time calculation of the properties in training
iterations is achieved by an accurate surrogate model. We constructed a small
and concise dataset to illustrate our framework. With multiple objectives
combined by their weight, and the 3D-GAN act as a soft constraint, our
framework is proved to be capable of tuning the properties of the generated
composites in multiple aspects, while keeping the selected features of
different kinds of structures. The feasibility on small dataset and potential
scalability on objectives of other properties make our work a novel, effective
approach to provide fast, experience free composite structure designs for
various functional materials.

<h3>Elementary models of 3D topological insulators with chiral symmetry</h3>

We construct a set of lattice models of non-interacting topological
insulators with chiral symmetry in three dimensions. We build a model of the
topological insulators in the class AIII by coupling lower dimensional models
of $\mathbb{Z}$ classes. By coupling the two AIII models related by
time-reversal symmetry we construct other chiral symmetric topological
insulators that may also possess additional symmetries (the time-reversal
and/or particle-hole).
There are two different chiral symmetry operators for the coupled model, that
correspond to two distinct ways of defining the sublattices. The integer
topological invariant (the winding number) in case of weak coupling can be
either the sum or difference of indices of the basic building blocks, dependent
on the preserved chiral symmetry operator. The value of the topological index
in case of weak coupling is determined by the chiral symmetry only and does not
depend on the presence of other symmetries. For $\mathbb{Z}$ topological
classes AIII, DIII, and CI with chiral symmetry are topologically equivalent,
it implies that a smooth transition between the classes can be achieved if it
connects the topological sectors with the same winding number. We demonstrate
this explicitly by proving that the gapless surface states remain robust in
$\mathbb{Z}$ classes as long as the chiral symmetry is preserved, and the
coupling does not close the gap in the bulk. By studying the surface states in
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classes, we show that class CII and AII are
distinct, and can not be adiabatically connected.

The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the
large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom
coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here we seek to
incorporate historical data and update and refine it using experimental
feedback by employing error-correction learning (ECL). We thus learn from prior
datasets and then adapt the model to differences in synthesis and
characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. We then apply
this strategy to discovering thermoelectric materials where we prioritize
synthesis at temperatures < 300{\deg}C. We document a previously unreported
chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, finding that the best
candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power
factor more than 2x that of PbSe. Our investigations show that our closed-loop
experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an
optimized material by as much as 3x compared to high-throughput searches
powered by state-of-the-art machine learning models. We also observe that this
improvement is dependent on the accuracy of prior in a manner that exhibits
diminishing returns, and after a certain accuracy is reached, it is factors
associated with experimental pathways that dictate the trends.

Hubbard-corrected density functional theory, denoted by DFT+U method, was
developed to enable correct prediction of insulating properties for
strongly-correlated electron systems. UO$_2$ is an example having O-$2p$,
U-$6d$, and U-$5f$ incomplete electronic shells. Usually, researchers apply the
Hubbard correction only to the localized incomplete $5f$ electrons of U atoms
and succeed to predict insulating property and good geometric properties by
tweaking the Hubbard-U parameter. However, it turned out that in such a way it
was impossible to obtain reasonable values for both geometry and electronic
band-gap at the same time. In this work, we show that it is possible to produce
good values for those properties just by applying and tuning the Hubbard
corrections to all incomplete shells of O-$2p$, U-$6d$, and U-$5f$.

NiMn is a collinear antiferromagnet with high magneto crystalline anisotropy
($K_2=-9.7\times10^5\;\text{J m}^{-3}$). Through magnetic annealing of NiMn
with excess Ni, strongly pinned magnetic moments emerge due to an imbalance in
the distribution of Ni in the antiferromagnetic Mn-sublattices. The results are
explained with a model of magnetic-field-biased diffusion, supported by ab
initio calculations. Another observation is the oxidation of Mn at the surface,
causing an enrichment of Ni in the sub-surface region. This leads to an
additional ferromagnetic response appearing in the magnetization measurements,
which can be removed by surface polishing.

Density functional theory calculations with the hybrid

metallic behavior is observed. Further increase of the sp3 carbon content
induces a reopening of the bandgap, showing a reentrant semiconducting behavior
in this class of materials.

the collective excitations, the condensate fraction, the depletion, the

The isotopic mass of constituent elements of materials has a well-known
effect on the energy of vibrational modes. By means of monochromated scanning
transmission electron microscopy we have experimentally studied the phonon
bandstructure of hexagonal BN, where a phonon band gap appears between in-plane
optical phonon modes and the lower energy part of the phonon spectrum. The size
of the phonon band gap can be manipulated by the isotopic mass of the boron.
While in $^{11}$BN the phonon band gap is about 7 meV wide, in $^{10}$BN the
gap nearly closes, being an order of magnitude smaller (below 0.5 meV). This
opens exciting options for manipulating terahertz wave propagation through
isotopically structured devices having otherwise no interfaces between
chemically distinct components.

The beneficial role of noise in learning is nowadays a consolidated concept
in the field of artificial neural networks. The training-with-noise algorithm
proposed by Gardner and collaborators is an emblematic example of a noise
injection procedure in recurrent networks. We show how adding structure into
noisy training data can substantially improve memory performance, allowing to
approach perfect classification and maximal basins of attraction. We also prove
that the so-called unlearning rule coincides with the training-with-noise
algorithm when noise is maximal and data are fixed points of the network
dynamics. Moreover, a sampling scheme for optimal noisy data is proposed and
implemented to outperform both the training-with-noise and the unlearning
procedures.

In this paper, we present evidence for a liquid-like phase in systems of many
interacting Bosons at intermediate densities. The interacting Bose gas has been
studied extensively in the low and high density regimes, in which interactions
do not play a physically significant role, and the system behaves similarly to
the ideal quantum gas. Instead, we will turn our attention to the intermediate
density regime, and report evidence that the system enters a strongly
correlated phase where its behavior is markedly different from that of the
ideal quantum gas. To do so, we use the Simplified approach to the Bose gas,
which was introduced by Lieb in 1963 and recently found to provide very
accurate predictions for many-Boson systems at all densities. Using this tool,
we will compute predictions for the radial distribution function, structure
factor, condensate fraction and momentum distribution, and show that they are
consistent with liquid-type behavior.

Knitting turns yarn, a 1D material, into a 2D fabric that is flexible,
durable [1], and can be patterned to adopt a wide range of 3D geometries [2].
Like other mechanical metamaterials [3], the elasticity of knitted fabrics is
an emergent property of the local stitch topology and pattern that cannot
solely be attributed to the yarn itself. Thus, knitting can be viewed as an
additive manufacturing technique that allows for stitch-by-stitch programming
of elastic properties and has applications in many fields ranging from soft
robotics [4-6] and wearable electronics [7,8] to engineered tissue[9] and
architected materials [10,11]. However, predicting these mechanical properties
based on the stitch type remains elusive. Here we untangle the relationship
between changes in stitch topology and emergent elasticity in several types of
knitted fabrics. We combine experiment and simulation to construct a
constitutive model for the nonlinear bulk response of these fabrics. This model
serves as a basis for composite fabrics with bespoke mechanical properties,
which crucially do not depend on the constituent yarn.

In this work, we show that a buckled honeycomb lattice can host a
boundary-obstructed topological superconductor (BOTS) in the presence of f-wave
spin-triplet pairing (fSTP). The underlying buckled structure allows for the
manipulation of both chemical potential and sublattice potential using a double
gate setup. Although a finite sublattice potential can stabilize the fSTP with
a possible higher-order band topology, because it also breaks the relevant
symmetry, the stability of the corner modes is not guaranteed. Here we show
that the fSTP on the honeycomb lattice gives BOTS under nonzero sublattice
potential, thus the corner modes can survive as long as the boundary is gapped.
Also, by examining the large sublattice potential limit where the honeycomb
lattice can be decomposed into two triangular lattices, we show that the
boundary modes in the normal state are the quintessential ingredient leading to
the BOTS. Thus the effective boundary Hamiltonian becomes nothing but the
Hamiltonian for Kitaev chains, which eventually gives the corner modes of the
BOTS.

Engineering the coupling between fundamental quantum excitations is at the
heart of quantum science and technologies. A significant case is the creation
of quantum light sources in which coupling between single photons and phonons
can be controlled and harnessed to enable quantum information transduction.
Here, we report the deterministic creation of quantum emitters featuring highly
tunable coupling between excitons and phonons. The quantum emitters are formed
in strain-induced quantum dots created in homobilayer semiconductor WSe2. The
colocalization of quantum confined interlayer excitons and THz interlayer
breathing mode phonons, which directly modulate the exciton energy, leads to a
uniquely strong phonon coupling to single-photon emission. The single-photon
spectrum of interlayer exciton emission features a single-photon purity >83%
and multiple phonon replicas, each heralding the creation of a phonon Fock
state in the quantum emitter. Owing to the vertical dipole moment of the
interlayer exciton, the phonon-photon interaction is electrically tunable in a
wide range, promising to reach the strong coupling regime. Our result
demonstrates a new type of solid-state quantum excitonic-optomechanical system
at the atomic interface that emits flying photonic qubits coupled with
stationary phonons, which could be exploited for quantum transduction and
interconnection.

Orowan strengthening is a primary way of strengthening metallic materials.The
effect of temperature on the Orowan strengthening mechanism is still debatable
in the present day.In this study,the effect of temperature on the Orowan
strengthening mechanism is systematically investigated,a thermal activation
Orowan strengthening mechanism is developed,and the corresponding Orowan stress
is deduced.The results indicate that the obstacle scales substantially affect
the thermal activation-based dislocation that bypasses the precipitates
processes.In small obstacle scales,the thermal activation contribution to
Orowan stress cannot be ignored;while in large obstacle scales,the thermal
activation contribution can be ignored even at high temperatures.In addition to
temperature, the effects of shear modulus,strain rate, and dislocation density
are investigated on Orowan stress.This work not only provides new insight into
the Orowan strengthening mechanism but also aids in the development of new
high-temperature structural materials.

The electrocaloric effect (ECE) offers a promising alternative to the
traditional gas compressing refrigeration due to its high efficiency and
environmental friendliness. The unusual negative electrocaloric effect refers
to the adiabatic temperature drops due to application of electric field, in
contrast with the normal (positive) ECE, and provides ways to improve the
electrocaloric efficiency in refrigeration cycles. However, negative ECE is
unusual and requires a clear understanding of microscopic mechanisms. Here, we
found unexpected and extensive negative ECE in nonpolar orthorhombic,
tetragonal, and cubic phases of halide and oxide perovskite at wide range of
temperature by means of first-principle-based large scale Monte Carlo methods.
Such unexpected negative ECE originates from the octahedral tilting related
entropy change rather than the polarization entropy change under the
application of electric field. Furthermore, a giant negative ECE with
temperature change of 8.6 K is found at room temperature. This giant and
extensive negative ECE in perovskite opens up new horizon in the research of
caloric effects and broadens the electrocaloric refrigeration ways with high
efficiency.

<h3>Robustness of Half-Integer Quantized Hall Conductivity in a Disordered  Dirac Semimetal with Parity Anomaly</h3>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional Dirac semimetals with a single massless Dirac cone can
exhibit the parity anomaly. Usually, such a kind of anomalous topological
semimetallic phase in real materials is unstable where any amount of disorder
can drive it into a diffusive metal and destroy the half-integer quantized Hall
conductivity as an indicator of parity anomaly. Here, based on low-energy
effective model, we propose an anisotropic Dirac semimetal which explicitly
breaks time-reversal symmetry and carries a half-integer quantized Hall
conductivity. This topological semimetallic phase can be realized on a deformed
honeycomb lattice subjected to a magnetic flux. Moreover, we establish the
disorder correction to the Hall conductivity. The results show that the
influence of disorder can be strongly suppressed and thereby the
half-quantization of Hall conductivity can exist in a wide region of disorder
and even strong disorder. The robustness of anisotropic topological Dirac
semimetal against disorder make it an exciting platform to investigate the
parity anomaly phenomena.

We develop the interface tool $\verb|wan2respack|$, which connects
$\verb|RESPACK|$ (software that derives the low-energy effective Hamiltonians
of solids) with $\verb|Wannier90|$ (software that constructs Wannier
functions). $\verb|wan2respack|$ converts the Wannier functions obtained by
$\verb|Wannier90|$ into those used in $\verb|RESPACK|$, which is then used to
derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonians of solids. In this paper, we
explain the basic usage of $\verb|wan2respack|$ and show its application to
standard compounds of correlated materials, namely, the correlated metal
SrVO$_3$ and the high-$T_{c}$ superconductor La$_2$CuO$_4$. Furthermore, we
compare the low-energy effective Hamiltonians of these compounds using Wannier
functions obtained by $\verb|Wannier90|$ and those obtained by
$\verb|RESPACK|$. We confirm that both types of Wannier functions give the same
Hamiltonians. This benchmark comparison demonstrates that $\verb|wan2respack|$
correctly converts Wannier functions in the $\verb|Wannier90|$ format into
those in the $\verb|RESPACK|$ format.

We introduce a computational method to optimize target physical properties in
the full configuration space regarding atomic composition, chemical
stoichiometry, and crystal structure. The approach combines the universal
potential of the crystal graph neural network and Bayesian optimization. The
proposed approach effectively obtains the crystal structure with the strongest
atomic cohesion from all possible crystals. Several new crystals with high
atomic cohesion are identified and confirmed by density functional theory for
thermodynamic and dynamic stability. Our method introduces a novel approach to
inverse materials design with additional functional properties for practical
applications.

While Bi-based layered supercell (LSC) compounds
[Bi$_n$O$_{n+\delta}$]-[$M$O$_2$] ($M$ = Mn, Mn/Al, Mn/Fe, or Mn/Ni; $n=2, 3$)
are a group of prospective candidates, all of the reported compounds are
insulators. Here, we report on the synthesis of two novel metallic LSC
compounds [Bi$_{n}$O$_{n+\delta}$]-[RhO$_2$] ($n=2, 3$) by pulsed laser
deposition and subsequent annealing. With tuning the thickness of the
sublattice from Bi$_2$O$_{2+\delta}$ to Bi$_3$O$_{3+\delta}$, a
dimensionality-dependent electrical transport is revealed from a conventional
metallic transport in $n=2$ to a localized transport in $n=3$. Our successful
growth will be an important step for further exploring novel layered oxide

<h3>The One-dimensional Chiral Anomaly and its Disorder Response</h3>

<br>
<br>
The realization of chiral anomaly in condensed matter physics has attracted
tremendous interest in exploring unexpected phenomena of quantum field theory.
Recent studies of chiral anomaly have been limited to three spatial dimensions.
Here, we show that one-dimensional (1D) chiral anomaly can be realized in a
paradigmatic generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where a single
gapless Dirac cone occurs. We reveal that such 1D chiral anomaly leads to the
half-integer quantization of topological Thouless pump and the anomalous
dynamics of chiral displacement. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of 1D
chiral anomaly with respect to two typical types of disorder, i.e., on-site
disorder and bond disorder. The results show that the on-site disorder tends to
smear the gapless Dirac cone. However, we propose a strategy to stabilize the
half-integer quantization, facilitating its experimental detection.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bond disorder causes a crossover with
disorder-enhanced topological charge pumping, driving the system into a
topological Anderson insulator phase.

The valley-contrasting geometric features of electronic wave functions
manifested in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment have profound
consequences on magnetotransport properties in both three- and two-dimensional
systems. Although the importance of employing
beyond-relaxation-time-approximation methods and intervalley scatterings in
collision integral has been confirmed in three dimensions, they have been
widely overlooked in previous studies on two-dimensional multi-valley systems.
Here, we revisit the issue of weak-field magnetoresistance in two-dimensional
multi-valley systems with broken inversion symmetry. We provide an exact
solution to the Boltzmann equation and demonstrate that the inclusion of
in-scattering terms in the collision integral can change the sign of the
magnetoresistance in high-density regime. With an initial valley polarization,
we also predict an orbital magnetic moment-induced intrinsic contribution to
Hall conductivity in the time-reversal-broken situation, which is consistently
negative, and in contrast to the anomalous Hall term, it does not depend on the
polarization sign. Depending on which valley has the excess charge, our
calculations show that a completely various behavior is exhibited in the
magnetoresistance which can be considered as a valley-polarization probe in the
experiment.

<h3>Simulation of dislocation slip and twin propagation in Mg through  coupling crystal plasticity and phase field models</h3>

<br>
<br>
A numerical strategy to simulate plastic deformation in Mg alloys including
dislocation slip and twin propagation is presented. Dislocation slip is
included through a crystal plasticity model which is solved using the finite
element method while twin propagation is taken into account by means of a phase
field model which is solved using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. The
coupled crystal plasticity and phase field equations were solved using
different discretizations of the simulation domain using the same time step for
both of them. The numerical strategy was used to simulate the deformation in
compression of a Mg micro-pillar along the $[10\bar{1}0]$ direction. The
stress-strain curve predicted by the model as well as the dominant deformation
mechanisms were in agreement with the experimental data in the literature and
demonstrate the viability of the strategy to take explicitly into account twin
propagation during the simulation of plastic deformation of Mg alloys. Finally,
an example of slip/twin interaction in polycrystals was simulated to show the
capabilities of the model.

<br>

The problem of understanding fundamental physical constants was discussed in
particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. Here, I show that a new insight
comes from condensed matter physics and liquid physics in particular:
fundamental constants have a bio-friendly window constrained by bio-friendly
viscosity and diffusion setting the motion in essential life processes in and
across cells. I also show that bounds on viscosity, diffusion and the
fundamental velocity gradient in a biochemical machine can all be varied while
keeping the fine-structure constant and the proton-to-electron mass ratio
intact, with no implication for the production of heavy nuclei in stars. This
leads to a conjecture of multiple tuning and an evolutionary mechanism.

The magnetism-controllable band topology renders magnetic topological
materials as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation
electronic devices. Here we first construct three datasets allowing
ascertaining the evolutions of topological states (with all enforced band
crossings identified) using symmetry-indicators in the 1651 magnetic space
groups. We then perform high-throughput investigations based on 1267
stoichiometric magnetic materials ever-experimentally synthesized and the three
datasets to reveal a hierarchy of topological states by symmetry-breaking,
along all ergodic and continuous paths of symmetry-breaking (preserving the
translation symmetry) from the parent magnetic space group to the trivial
group. The results are expected to aid experimentalists in selecting feasible
and appropriate means to tune topological states towards realistic applications
in new paradigm of memory device by topological state switching.

We study repulsive two-component Bose mixtures with equal populations and
confined in a finite-size box through path-integral Monte Carlo simulations.
For different values of the $s$-wave scattering length of the interspecies
potential, we calculate the local population imbalance in a region of fixed
volume inside the box at different temperatures. We find two different
behaviors: for phase-separated states at $T=0$, thermal effects induce a
diffusion process which reduces the local imbalance whereas, for miscible
states at $T=0$, a maximum in the local population imbalance appears at a
certain temperature, below the critical one. We show that this intriguing
behavior is strongly related to the bunching effect associated with the
Bose-Einstein statistics of the particles in the mixture and to an unexpected
behavior of the cross pair distribution function not reported before.

The evolution of the physical properties of two-dimensional material from
monolayer limit to the bulk reveals unique consequences from dimension
confinement and provides a distinct tuning knob for applications. Monolayer
1T'-phase transition metal dichalcogenides (1T'-TMDs) with ubiquitous quantum
spin Hall (QSH) states are ideal two-dimensional building blocks of various
three-dimensional topological phases. However, the stacking geometry was
previously limited to the bulk 1T'-WTe2 type. Here, we introduce the novel
2M-TMDs consisting of translationally stacked 1T'-monolayers as promising
material platforms with tunable inverted bandgaps and interlayer coupling. By
performing advanced polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy as well as first-principles calculations on the electronic
structure of 2M-TMDs, we revealed a topology hierarchy: 2M-WSe2, MoS2, and
MoSe2 are weak topological insulators (WTIs), whereas 2M-WS2 is a strong
topological insulator (STI). Further demonstration of topological phase
transitions by tunning interlayer distance indicates that band inversion
amplitude and interlayer coupling jointly determine different topological
states in 2M-TMDs. We propose that 2M-TMDs are parent compounds of various
exotic phases including topological superconductors and promise great
application potentials in quantum electronics due to their flexibility in
patterning with two-dimensional materials.

A stronger interlayer magnetic coupling (ILMC) can open up new opportunities
in spintronics devices for Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT), a demonstrated
two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) material with high Currie temperature.
Here we observe an extraordinary ILMC spike in F5GT, jumping from 1.15 to 12.79
meV/f.u, by applying a 3% in-plane strain. This spike is mainly ascribed to a
significant increase in the magnetic moment of the Fe5 ion. Moreover, the
applied in-plane strain can also significantly enhance the magnetic anisotropy
energy (MAE) of the system, triggering the transition between the in/off-plane
configurations in multi-layer F5GT.

<h3>Out-of-equilibrium spherical model with correlated noise: critical  phenomena, long-range correlation, and hyperuniformity</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-equilibrium noises, such as 1/f noise, often have long-range
spatio-temporal correlations. How do such correlations affect the critical
phenomena? To answer this question, we consider a spherical model driven by
non-equilibrium correlated noise that does not satisfy the detailed balance.
The correlation of the noise in the Fourier space is represented as
$D(\boldsymbol{q},\omega) =|\boldsymbol{q}|^{-2\rho}|\omega|^{-2\theta}$, where
$\boldsymbol{q}$ denotes the wave vector, and $\omega$ denotes the frequency.
In most previous studies, the values of $\rho$ and $\theta$ have been limited
to $0<\rho<d/2$ and $0<\theta<1/2$, where the noise correlation decreases
algebraically and monotonically in real space. For $\rho<0$ or $\theta<0$, on
the contrary, $D(\boldsymbol{q},\omega)$ vanishes for small $|\boldsymbol{q}|$
or $|\omega|$, namely, the fluctuation of the noise in large spatial-temporal
scale is highly suppressed. Here we also consider the latter case, partially
motivated by recent numerical simulations of particle systems driven by the
center of mass conserving dynamics, the fluctuation of which is highly
suppressed on the large spatial scale. When $\rho=\theta=0$, our model reduces
to the equilibrium model, where the standard Ising universality class is
observed. On the contrary, when $\rho\neq 0$ or $\theta\neq 0$, we find
different universality classes, for which the critical exponents vary depending
on $\rho$ and $\theta$. We also discuss that the fluctuation of the conserved
order parameter exhibits the power-low correlation or hyperuniformity even well
above the critical point.

We experimentally measure the osmotic pressures of linear polymers and
three-, four-, and eight-arm star polymers in a good solvent via membrane
osmometry. These results reveal that the osmotic equations of state in the star
polymer solutions are universally described by the same scaling function that
describes linear polymer solutions. This universality is achieved by canceling
increasing overlap concentrations and decreasing osmotic pressure, owing to the
increased arm number. We further clarify the molar mass and arm number
dependencies of the gyration radius and interpenetration factor, ensuring
universality in star polymer solutions.

<h3>A deep learning approach to the measurement of long-lived memory kernels  from Generalised Langevin Dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Memory effects are ubiquitous in a wide variety of complex physical
phenomena, ranging from glassy dynamics and metamaterials to climate models.
The Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) provides a rigorous way to describe
memory effects via the so-called memory kernel in an integro-differential
equation. However, the memory kernel is often unknown, and accurately
predicting or measuring it via e.g. a numerical inverse Laplace transform
remains a herculean task. Here we describe a novel method using deep neural
networks (DNNs) to measure memory kernels from dynamical data. As
proof-of-principle, we focus on the notoriously long-lived memory effects of
glassy systems, which have proved a major challenge to existing methods.
Specifically, we learn a training set generated with the Mode-Coupling Theory
(MCT) of hard spheres. Our DNNs are remarkably robust against noise, in
contrast to conventional techniques which require ensemble averaging over many
independent trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate that a network trained on
data generated from analytic theory (hard-sphere MCT) generalises well to data
from simulations of a different system (Brownian Weeks-Chandler-Andersen
particles). We provide a general pipeline, KernelLearner, for training networks
to extract memory kernels from any non-Markovian system described by a GLE. The
success of our DNN method applied to glassy systems suggests deep learning can
play an important role in the study of dynamical systems that exhibit memory
effects.

By imaginary-time evolution with Hamiltonian, an arbitrary state arrives in
the system's ground state. In this work, we conjecture that this dynamics can
be simulated by measurement-only circuit (MoC), where each projective
measurement is set in a suitable way. Based on terms in the Hamiltonian and
ratios of their parameters (coefficients), we propose a guiding principle for
the choice of the measured operators called stabilizers and also the
probability of projective measurement in the MoC. In order to examine and
verify this conjecture of the parameter ratio and probability ratio
correspondence, we study a generalized (1+1)-D $Z_2$ lattice gauge-Higgs model,
whose phase diagram is very rich including symmetry-protected topological
phase, phase of spontaneous breaking of higher-form symmetry, etc. We find that
the MoC constructed by the guiding principle reproduces phase diagram very
similar to that of the ground state of the gauge-Higgs Hamiltonian. The present
work indicates that the MoC can be broadly used to produce interesting phases
of matter, which are difficult to be simulated by ordinary Hamiltonian systems.

In this paper, we investigate the XY model in the presence of an additional
potential term that independently tunes the vortex fugacity. By increasing the
strength of this term and thereby the vortex chemical potential $\mu$, we
observe significant changes in the phase diagram with the emergence of a normal
vortex-antivortex lattice as well as a superconducting vortex-antivortex
crystal (supersolid) phase. We examine the transition lines between these two
phases and the conventional non-crystalline one as a function of both the
temperature and the chemical potential. Our findings suggest the possibility of
a peculiar tricritical point where second-order, first-order, and
infinite-order transition lines meet. We discuss the differences between the
present phase diagram and previous results for two-dimensional Coulomb gas
models. Our study provides important insights into the behaviour of the
modified XY model and opens up new possibilities for investigating the
underlying physics of unconventional phase transitions.

<h3>Searching for iron nanoparticles with a general-purpose Gaussian  approximation potential</h3>

<i>Richard Jana, Miguel A. Caro</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a general-purpose machine learning Gaussian approximation
potential (GAP) for iron that is applicable to all bulk crystal structures
found experimentally under diverse thermodynamic conditions, as well as
surfaces and nanoparticles (NPs). By studying its phase diagram, we show that
our GAP remains stable at extreme conditions, including those found in the
Earth's core. The new GAP is particularly accurate for the description of NPs.
We use it to identify new low-energy NPs, whose stability is verified by
performing density functional theory calculations on the GAP structures. Many
of these NPs are lower in energy than those previously available in the
literature up to $N_\text{atoms}=100$. We further extend the convex hull of
available stable structures to $N_\text{atoms}=200$. For these NPs, we study
characteristic surface atomic motifs using data clustering and low-dimensional
embedding techniques. With a few exceptions, e.g., at magic numbers
$N_\text{atoms}=59$, $65$, $76$ and $78$, we find that iron tends to form
irregularly shaped NPs without a dominant surface character or characteristic
atomic motif, and no reminiscence of crystalline features. We hypothesize that
the observed disorder stems from an intricate balance and competition between
the stable bulk motif formation, with bcc structure, and the stable surface
motif formation, with fcc structure. We expect these results to improve our
understanding of the fundamental properties and structure of low-dimensional
forms of iron, and to facilitate future work in the field of iron-based
catalysis.

Trimers are chains formed by two lattice edges, and therefore three monomers.
We consider trimers placed on the square lattice, the edges belonging to the
same trimer are either colinear, forming a straight rod with unitary
statistical weight, or perpendicular, a statistical weight $\omega$ being
associated to these angular trimers. The thermodynamic properties of this model
are studied in the full lattice limit, where all lattice sites are occupied by
monomers belonging to trimers. In particular, we use transfer matrix techniques
to estimate the entropy of the system as a function of $\omega$. The entropy
$s(\omega)$ is a maximum at $\omega=1$ and our results are compared to earlier
studies in the literature for straight trimers ($\omega=0$), angular trimers
($\omega \to \infty$) and for mixtures of equiprobable straight and angular
trimers ($\omega=1$).

<br>
In modern electronics based on conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
technology, the logic state of a device is controlled by a gate voltage (VG).
The applied VG changes the density of charge carriers flowing through a small
(nanoscale-size) device constriction, and this effect sets the logic state of
the device. The superconducting equivalent of such effect had remained unknown
until recently, when it has been shown that a VG can tune the superconducting
current (supercurrent) flowing through a nanoconstriction in a metallic
superconductor. This gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) effect has raised great
interest because it can lead to superconducting logics like CMOS logics, but
with lower energy dissipation. The mechanism underlying the GCS, however,
remains under debate. Here, after reviewing the mechanisms proposed to explain
the GCS effect, we determine the material and device parameters that mainly
affect a GCS, based on the studies reported to date. Our analysis suggests that
some mechanisms are only relevant for specific experiments, and it reveals the
importance of parameters like structural disorder and surface properties for a
GCS. We also propose studies that can answer the remaining open questions on
the GCS effect, which is key to control such effect for its future
technological applications.

In the ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, colossal
magnetoresistance (CMR) arises below $T_\mathrm{c}=78$ K due to the interplay
of magnetism and topological nodal-line fermiology. The Berry curvature
associated with the topological nodal-line is expected to produce an anomalous
Nernst effect. Here, we present sizable anomalous Nernst signal in
Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ below $T_\mathrm{c}$. In the low-magnetic-field region where
CMR is most apparent, the scaling ratio between the Nernst signal and
magnetization is significantly enhanced compared to that in conventional
magnetic materials. The enhanced Nernst effect and CMR likely share the same
mechanisms, which are closely linked to the nodal-line topology.

There is a plethora of 1-dimensional advected systems with an absorbing
boundary: the Toom model of anchored interfaces, the directed exclusion process
where in addition to diffusion particles and holes can jump over their right
neighbor, simple diffusion with advection, and Oslo sandpiles. All these models
share a roughness exponent of $\zeta=1/4$, while the dynamic exponent $z$
varies, depending on the observable. We show that for the first three models
$z=1$, $z=2$, and $z=1/2$ are realized, depending on the observable. The Oslo
model is apart with a conjectured dynamic exponent of $z=10/7$. Since the
height in the latter is the gradient of the position of a disordered elastic
string, this shows that $\zeta =5/4$ for a driven elastic string at depinning.

<h3>Scanning qubit probe of edge states in a topological insulator</h3>

<i>Nicolas Delnour, Alexei Bissonnette, Hichem Eleuch, Richard MacKenzie, Michael Hilke</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we propose a novel qubit-based sensor with the ability to
characterize topological edge states in low-dimensional systems. A composite
system is studied, consisting of a qubit coupled to a topologically nontrivial
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain between semi-infinite lead channels. This qubit
probe utilizes decoherence dynamics which, under a weak-coupling framework, are
related to the environment's local density of states. Qubit decoherence rate
measurements along a sample therefore provide the means to extract edge state
profiles. The environment's influence on the qubit's subspace is captured by an
effective projective treatment, leading to an analytical decoherence rate
expression. We demonstrate that the scanning qubit probe identifies and yields
a complete spatial characterization of the topological edge states within the
composite system.

The centrosymmetric halide perovskites undergo a continuous phase transition
from a normal insulator to a topological insulator at the critical value of
strain. Contrarily, in noncentrosymmetric halide perovskites, this phase
transition is discontinuous. The noncentrosymmetry does not stabilize the
gapless state, causing a discontinuity in the bandgap. We have employed the
density functional theory and Slater-Koster formalism-based tight-binding
Hamiltonian studies to understand the evolution of band topology under the
compressive strain in the halide perovskites. Our study shows that both cubic
and pseudocubic FAPbI$_3$ undergo a Pb $\textit{s-p}$ band inversion at
$\gamma$ (V/V$_0$) = 0.76 and 0.73, respectively. The cubic perovskite shows
the surface state at $\overline{M}$, whereas, the pseudocubic structure shows
two conducting states in the neighbourhood of $\overline{M}$, unlike the
conventional topological insulator. The Pb-Pb second nearest neighbor
interactions determine this topological phase transition. Alongside, we have
modeled mixed cation halide perovskites Cs$_x$MA$_{1-x}$PbI$_3$ (\textit{x} =
0.25, 0.5 and 0.75) to study their topological properties.
Cs$_{0.5}$MA$_{0.5}$PbI$_3$ shows non-trivial topology at $\gamma$ = 0.74. In
addition, we have checked the structural stability of different strained
configurations using ab \textit{initio} molecular dynamics at operational
temperature. Their structural stability under compression strengthens the
experimental relevance.

<br>
<br>
PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ is considered as one of the rare candidate materials for a
three-dimensional quantum spin liquid (QSL). This assessment was based on the
results of various magnetic experiments, performed mainly on polycrystalline
material. More recent measurements on single crystals revealed an even more
exotic behavior, yielding ferroelectric order below $T_{\text{FE}}\approx
1\,\text{K}$, accompanied by distinct lattice distortions, and a somewhat
modified magnetic response which is still consistent with a QSL. Here we report
on low-temperature measurements of various thermodynamic, magnetic and
dielectric properties of single crystalline PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ in magnetic fields
$B\leq 14.5\,\text{T}$. The combination of these various probes allows us to
construct a detailed $B$-$T$ phase diagram including a ferroelectric phase for
$B \leq$ $8\,\text{T}$ and a $B$-induced magnetic phase at $B \geq$
$11\,\text{T}$. These phases are preceded by or coincide with a structural
transition from a cubic high-temperature phase into a distorted non-cubic
low-temperature state. The phase diagram discloses two quantum critical points
(QCPs) in the accessible field range, a ferroelectric QCP at $B_{c1}$ =
$7.9\,\text{T}$ and a magnetic QCP at $B_{c2}$ = $11\,\text{T}$. Field-induced
lattice distortions, observed in the state at $T>$ $1\,\text{K}$ and which are
assigned to the effect of spin-orbit interaction of the Cu$^{2+}$-ions, are
considered as the key mechanism by which the magnetic field couples to the
dielectric degrees of freedom in this material.

<h3>Bioabsorbable WE43 Mg alloy wires modified by continuous plasma  electrolytic oxidation for implant applications. Part II: degradation and  biological performance</h3>

<br>
<br>
The corrosion, mechanical degradation and biological performance of
cold-drawn WE43 Mg wires were analyzed as a function of thermo-mechanical
processing and the presence of a protective oxide layer created by continuous
plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO). It was found that the corrosion properties
of the non-surface-treated wire could be optimized by means of thermal
treatment within certain limits, but the corrosion rate remained very high.
Hence, strength and ductility of these wires vanished after 24 h of immersion
in simulated body fluid at 37$^\circ$C and, as a result of that rather quick
degradation, direct tests did not show any MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell
attachment on the surface of the Mg wires. In contrast, surface modification of
the annealed WE43 Mg wires by a continuous PEO process led to the formation of
a homogeneous oxide layer of $\approx$ 8$\mu$m and significantly improved the
corrosion resistance and hence the biocompatibility of the WE43 Mg wires. It
was found that a dense layer of Ca/P was formed at the early stages of
degradation on top of the Mg(OH)2 layer and hindered the diffusion of the
Cl-ions which dissolve Mg(OH)2 and accelerate the corrosion of Mg alloys. As a
result, pitting corrosion was suppressed and the strength of the Mg wires was
above 100 MPa after 96 h of immersion in simulated body fluid at 37$^\circ$C.
Moreover, many cells were able to attach on the surface of the PEO
surface-modified wires during cell culture testing. These results demonstrate
the potential of thin Mg wires surface-modified by continuous PEO in terms of
mechanical, degradation and biological performance for bioabsorbable wire-based
devices.

A phase field model for ductile fracture considering Hencky strain and finite
J2 plasticity is presented using the nonlocal operator method. A variational
derivation of J2 plasticity at finite strain with a phase field model is
performed. The method includes a logarithmic strain tensor and an exponential
mapping in the plasticity evolution. A spectral decomposition based algorithm
for computing the first and second order derivatives of the composite matrix
function is implemented. A consistent tangential stiffness matrix is derived
and used in Newton-Raphson iterations. Several numerical examples are performed
to validate the method, including notched single-edged plates with brittle
fracture or ductile fracture and necking of a bar with/without phase field
model.

<h3>Triclinic metamaterials by tristable origami with reprogrammable  frustration</h3>

<br>
<br>
Geometrical frustration induced anisotropy and inhomogeneity are explored to
achieve unique properties of metamaterials that set them apart from
conventional materials. According to Neumann's principle, to achieve
anisotropic responses, the material unit cell should possess less symmetry.
Based on such guidelines, we present a triclinic metamaterial system of minimal
symmetry, which is originated from a Trimorph origami pattern with a simple and
insightful geometry: a basic unit cell with four tilted panels and four
corresponding creases. The intrinsic geometry of the Trimorph origami, with its
changing tilting angles, dictates a folding motion that varies the primitive
vectors of the unit cell, couples the shear and normal strains of its extrinsic
bulk, and leads to an unusual Poisson's effect. Such effect, associated to
reversible auxeticity in the changing triclinic frame, is observed
experimentally, and predicted theoretically by elegant math formulae. The
nonlinearities of the folding motions allow the unit cell to display three
robust stable states, connected through snapping instabilities. When the
tristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resembles linear and point
defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration. The frustration is
reprogrammable into distinct stable and inhomogeneous states by arbitrarily
selecting the location of a single or multiple point defects. The Trimorph
origami demonstrates the possibility of creating origami metamaterials with
symmetries that were hitherto non-existent, leading to triclinic metamaterials
with tunable anisotropy for potential applications such as wave propagation
control and compliant microrobots.

<h3>Synthesis of a Semiconducting 2D Material for Novel Strong PUFs</h3>

The exponentially growing number of interconnected devices in the Internet of
Things poses an increasing amount of challenges to the field of cyber security
and encryption. For authenticated use and communication, each device must
securely store and apply secret keys without giving a potential attacker the
possibility to access them neither by software nor hardware attacks. In 2002,
the concept of Physical Unclonable Function emerged to counteract the inherent
threats, associated with this trend. Physical disordered systems are excited by
external stimuli and can thereby be uniquely identified. 2D materials have
profoundly different characteristics when isolated from their bulk form to few-
or monolayers. Transition metal dichalcogenides represent a potential PUF
candidate since, unlike graphene, they feature a bandgap and are thus
semiconducting. Furthermore, a random percolation network can be formed from
them, which is expected to possess an electrical response that is uniquely
identifiable yet unpredictable. This work has built the foundation for
implementing a PUF consisting of a TMD, namely tungsten disulfide. The material
has been synthesized using chemical vapor deposition in the close proximity
approach. In order to fabricate a large-scale inter-connected surface
consisting of WS2, the growth parameters are selected and enclosed by a
preliminary trial and error optimization and ultimately optimized by Design of
Experiments. This yields a potentially available PUF area of several
millimeters, which was then patterned and contacted with initial trials.

<h3>Large ordered moment with strong easy-plane anisotropy and vortex-domain  pattern in the kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report the structural and magnetic properties of high-quality bulk single
crystals of the kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn. The dependence of magnetisation on
the magnitude and orientation of the external field reveals strong easy-plane
type uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, which shows a monotonous increase from
$K_1=-0.99\times 10^6 J/m^3$ at 300\,K to $-1.23\times10^6 J/m^3$ at 2\,K. Our
\textit{ab initio} electronic structure calculations yield the value of total
magnetic moment of about 6.9 $\mu_B$/f.u. and a magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy density of 0.406\,meV/f.u. ($1.16\times10^6 J/m^3$) both being in good
agreement with the experimental values. The self-consistent DFT computations
for the components of the spin/orbital moments indicate that the small
difference between the saturation magnetisations measured along and
perpendicular to the kagome layers results from the subtle balance between the
Fe and Sn spin/orbital moments on the different sites. In zero field, magnetic
force microscopy reveals micrometer-scale magnetic vortices with weakly pinned
cores that vanish at $\sim$3\,T applied perpendicular to the kagome plane. Our
micromagnetic simulations, using the experimentally determined value of
anisotropy, well reproduce the observed vortex-domain structure. The present
study, in comparison with the easy-axis ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, shows that
varying the stacking of kagome layers provides an efficient control over
magnetic anisotropy in this family of Fe-based kagome magnets.

<h3>Suppression of one-dimensional weak localization by band asymmetry</h3>

We investigate disorder-induced localization in metals that break
time-reversal and inversion symmetries through their energy dispersion,
$\epsilon_{k}\neq\epsilon_{-k}$, but lack Berry phases. In the perturbative
regime of disorder, we show that weak localization is suppressed due to a
mismatch of the Fermi velocities of left and right movers. To substantiate this
analytical result, we perform quench numerics on chains shorter than the
Anderson localization length -- the latter computed and verified to be finite
using the recursive Green's function method -- and find a sharp rise in the
saturation value of the participation ratio due to band asymmetry, indicating a
tendency to delocalize.

<h3>SQUID current sensors with an integrated thermally actuated input  current limiter</h3>

<i>Rainer KÃ¶rber, Patryk Krzysteczko, Monique Klemm, Tianhao Liu, Jan-Hendrik Storm, JÃ¶rn Beyer</i>
<br>
<br>
The development of SQUID current sensors with a thermally actuated input
current limiter (TCL) integrated into the input circuit of the sensor is
presented. The TCL is based on an unshunted Josephson Junction (JJ) series
array, around which meanders a galvanically isolated, but tightly, thermally
coupled, resistive heater element. By applying a current to the heater, the JJ
critical currents can be reduced or completely suppressed, while the other
on-chip SQUID circuit elements remain unaffected. The functional parameters of
the TCL are determined by direct transport measurements and by static and
dynamic flux coupling tests via the input circuit. In liquid Helium, a heater
power, which reliably suppresses the critical current of the JJ array to zero,
of $\sim$1.5 mW was needed, with the TCL normal state resistance being at 500
$\Omega$. In this configuration, typical TCL switching times below 10 $\mu$s
were observed in the direct transport measurements.
The TCL can be used to temporarily or even permanently disable malfunctioning
channels in multichannel SQUID magnetometer systems, when feedback into their
otherwise superconducting input circuits is not possible. In doing so,
significant signal distortions in neighbouring channels from screening currents
in these input circuits are avoided. Furthermore, by completely suppressing and
restoring the TCL critical current, dc offset currents in the superconducting
input circuits can be prevented. This is relevant, for instance, in SQUID-based
spin precession experiments on hyperpolarized noble gases, in which even dc
currents of a few $\mu$A in the input circuit can lead to significant magnetic
field distortions in the adjacent sample region contributing to the transverse
spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_{2}$

<br>
<br>
We analyze an analog of the $t$-$J$-$U$ model as applied to the description
of a single moir\'e flat band of twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer. To take into account
the correlation effects induced by a significant strength of the Coulomb
repulsion, we use the Gutzwiller approach and compare it with the results
obtained by the Hartree-Fock method. We discuss in detail the graduate
appearance of a two dome structure of the superconducting state in the phase
diagram by systematically increasing the Coulomb repulsion integral, $U$. The
two superconducting domes residing on both sides of a Mott insulating state can
be reproduced for a realistic parameter range in agreement with the available
experimental data. According to our analysis the paired state has a highly
unconventional character with a mixed $d+id$ (singlet) and $p-ip$ (triplet)
symmetry. Both components of the mixed paired state are of comparable
amplitudes. However, as shown here, a transition between pure singlet and pure
triplet pairing should be possible in the considered system by tuning the gate
voltage, which controls the magnitude of the valley-dependent spin-splitting in
the system.

We present our studies on polycrystalline samples of fluorine doped LaMnO3
(LaMnO3-yFy). LaMnO2.5F0.5 exhibits remarkable magnetic and electrical
properties. It shows ferromagnetic and metallic behavior with a high Curie
temperature of ~ 239 K and a high magnetoresistance of -64. This drastic change
in magnetic properties in comparison to pure LaMnO3 is ascribed to the presence
of mixed-valence Mn ions driven by the F-doping at the O-sites, which enables
double exchange (DE) in LMOF. Furthermore, the resistivity data exhibits two
resistivity peaks at 239 K and 213 K, respectively. Our results point towards
the possibility of multiple double exchange hopping paths of two distinct
resistances existing simultaneously in the sample below 213 K.

This paper studies thermal transport in nanoporous silicon with a significant
specific surface area. First, the equilibrium molecular dynamics approach was
used to obtain the dependence of thermal conductivity on a specific surface
area. Then, a modified phonon transport kinetic theory-based approach was
developed to analyze thermal conductivity. Two models were used to evaluate the
phonon mean free path in the porous materials. The first model approximates the
dependence of the mean free path only with the specific surface area, and the
second one investigates the dependence of the mean free path variation with the
porosity in the peculiar case of a highly porous matrix. Both models
approximate molecular dynamics data well for the smaller porosity values, while
the first model fails for large porosities. The second model matches well with
molecular dynamics simulations for all considered ranges of the porosities.
This work illustrates that the phonon mean free path dependence with the
porosity/volume fraction of composite materials is essential for describing
thermal transport in systems with significant surface-to-volume fractions.

<br>
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states arise as sub-gap excitations of a magnetic
impurity in a superconducting host. Taking into account the quantum nature of
the impurity spin in a single-site approximation, we study the spectral
properties of the YSR excitations of a system of magnetic impurity in a
spin-split superconductor, i.e. a superconductor in proximity to a
ferromagnetic insulator at zero external magnetic fields. The YSR excitations
of this system exhibit a robust spin-polarization that is protected from
fluctuations and environmental noise by the exchange field of the ferromagnetic
insulator, which can be as large as a few Tesla. We compare the results of this
quantum approach to the classical approach, which conventionally predicts fully
polarized YSR excitations even in the absence of exchange and external magnetic
field. Turning on a small magnetic field, we show the latter splits the YSR
excitations in the regime where the impurity is strongly coupled to the
superconductor, whilst the classical approach predicts no such splitting. The
studied system can potentially be realized in a tunnel junction connected to a
quantum dot in proximity to a spin-split superconductor.

<h3>Topological or not? A unified pattern description in the one-dimensional  anisotropic quantum XY model with a transverse field</h3>

The nature of phase transitions involving the questions why and how phase
transitions take place has not been sufficiently touched in the literature. In
contrast, the current attention to certain extent still focus on the
description of critical phenomena and the classification of the associated
phase transition along with the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm, where the key
issue is to identify phenomenologically order parameters and related
symmetries. This brings the question to topological phase transitions (TPTs),
where no obvious order parameter and the broken symmetry are identified. Here
we present a unified pattern description of the second-order quantum phase
transition (QPT) and TPT, both involved in the one-dimensional anisotropic
quantum XY model in a transverse field, which contains the transverse Ising
model (TIM) as a limit case. Away from the TIM, the XY model enters the
ferromagnetic phase (marked by a second-order QPT or a direct TPT) as
increasing ferromagentic exchange coupling, a series of TPTs occur, which are
absent in the TIM. The TPTs behave like the first-order QPTs. In the isotropic
and large exchange coupling cases, the ground state of the XY model is
dominated by two topologically different vortices along positive and negative
direction of the transverse field. We confirm the above conclusion by analyzing
the energy contributions of the patterns to the ground state and calculating
the ground state pattern occupations of the XY model. The results have been
obtained in a unified and self-evident way and answer the questions why and how
the QPT and TPTs take place in the XY model.

Heat rectifiers would facilitate energy management operations such as
cooling, or energy harvesting, but devices of practical interest are still
missing. Understanding heat rectification at a fundamental level is key to help
us find or design such devices. The match or mismatch of the phonon band
spectrum of device segments for forward or reverse temperature bias of the
thermal baths at device boundaries, was proposed as the mechanism behind
rectification. However no explicit, theoretical relation derived from first
principles had been found so far between heat fluxes and spectral matching. We
study heat rectification in a minimalistic chain of two coupled ions. The
fluxes and rectification can be calculated analytically. We propose a
definition of the matching that sets an upper bound for the heat flux. In a
regime where the device rectifies optimally, matching and flux ratios for
forward and reverse configurations are found to be proportional. The results
can be extended to a system of N particles in arbitrary traps with
nearest-neighbor linear interactions.

We propose and study a theoretical model of insulators which show de Haas-van
Alphen oscillations as well as periodic dependence of the magnetization on
inverse temperature. The insulating behavior is due to the Coulomb interaction
driven hybridization of fermions at the crossing point of their energy bands.
We show that the leading contribution to the oscillations at small magnetic
fields is due to the oscillatory dependence of the hybridization gap on the
magnetic field. In order to see this the hybridization is derived from a
self-consistent non-linear equation. We show that the amplitude of the de
Haas-van Alphen is periodic in inverse temperature with a period defined by a
combination of the hybridization gap and magnetic field. Moreover, we predicted
that the amplitude must vanish at a particular field proportional to the
hybridization gap.

systems, superlattices, or thermal metamaterials. It became a challenge to
orient among the models, mainly due to their various thermodynamic backgrounds
and possible compatibility issues. Additionally, in light of the recent
findings on the field of non-Fourier heat conduction, it is not even
straightforward how to interpret and utilize a non-Fourier heat equation,
primarily when one aims to thermally design the material structure to construct
the new generation of thermal metamaterials. Adding that numerous modeling
strategies can be found in the literature accompanying different
interpretations even for the same heat equation makes it even more difficult to
orient ourselves and find a comprehensive picture of this field of research.
Therefore, this review aims to ease the orientation among advanced heat
equations beyond Fourier by discussing properties concerning their possible
practical applications in light of experiments. We start from the simplest
model with basic principles and notions, then proceed toward the more complex
models related to coupled phenomena such as ballistic heat conduction. We do
not enter the often complicated technical details of each thermodynamic
framework but do not aim to compare each approach. However, we still briefly
present their background to highlight their origin and the limitations acting
on the models. Additionally, the field of non-Fourier heat conduction has
become quite segmented, and that paper also aims to provide a common ground, a
comprehensive mutual understanding of the basics of each model, together with
what phenomenon they can be applied to.

Recent work has demonstrated that MoB$_2$, transforming to the same structure
as MgB$_2$ ($P6/mmm$), superconducts at temperatures above 30 K near 100 GPa
[C. Pei $et$ $al$. Natl. Sci. Rev., nwad034 (2023)], and Nb-substitution in
MoB$_2$ stabilizes the $P6/mmm$ structure down to ambient pressure [A. C. Hire
$et$ $al$. Phys. Rev. B 106, 174515 (2022)]. The current work explores the high
pressure superconducting behavior of Nb-substituted MoB$_2$
(Nb$_{0.25}$Mo$_{0.75}$B$_2$). High pressure x-ray diffraction measurements
show that the sample remains in the ambient pressure $P6/mmm$ structure to at
least 160 GPa. Electrical resistivity measurements demonstrate that from an
ambient pressure $T_c$ of 8 K (confirmed by specific heat to be a bulk effect),
the critical temperature is suppressed to 4 K at 50 GPa, before gradually
rising to 5.5 K at 170 GPa. The critical temperature at high pressure is thus
significantly lower than that found in MoB$_2$ under pressure (30 K), revealing
that Nb-substitution results in a strong suppression of the superconducting
critical temperature. Our calculations indeed find a reduced electron-phonon
coupling in Nb$_{0.25}$Mo$_{0.75}$B$_2$, but do not account fully for the
observed suppression, which may also arise from enhanced spin fluctuations.

Microgels are soft microparticles that often exhibit thermoresponsiveness and
feature a transformation at a critical temperature, referred to as the volume
phase transition temperature. The question of whether this transformation
occurs as a smooth or as a discontinuous one is still a matter of debate. This
question can be addressed by studying individual microgels trapped in optical
tweezers. For this aim, composite particles were obtained by decorating pNIPAM
microgels with iron oxide nanocubes. These composites become self-heating when
illuminated by the infrared trapping laser, featuring Hot Brownian Motion
within the trap. Above a certain laser power, a single decorated microgel
features a volume phase transition that is discontinuous, while the usual
continuous sigmoidal-like dependence is recovered after averaging over
different microgels. The collective sigmoidal behavior enables the application
of a power-to-temperature calibration and provides the effective drag
coefficient of the self-heating microgels, thus establishing these composite
particles as potential micro-thermometers and micro-heaters. Moreover, the
self-heating microgels also exhibit an unexpected and intriguing bistability
behavior above the critical temperature, probably due to partial collapses of
the microgel. These results set the stage for further studies and the
development of applications based on the Hot Brownian Motion of soft particles.

The Maxwell-Boltzmann ideal gas model is known to be the simplest model that
is considered in classical statistical physics and thermodynamics to describe
gas behavior. However, classical approach can no longer be rigorously valid if
quantum effect becomes significant. In this work, we consider a study of
corrections to the Maxwell-Boltzmann ideal gas model related to quantum size
effect by using an approach based on the concept of quantum phase space. A
canonical quantum partition function is deduced in order to obtain all
thermodynamics properties. A corrected state equation for ideal gas and
expressions of thermodynamic state functions such as internal energy, entropy
and free energy are deduced. The corrections are expected to be particularly
useful to describe the deviation from classical behavior of a Maxwell-Boltzmann
gas at low temperature and in confined space. The properties of classical ideal
gas are obtained as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.

<h3>Collective Quantum Approach to Surface Plasmon Resonance Effect</h3>

In this research we present a theory of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
effect based on the dual length-scale driven damped collective quantum
oscillations of the spill-out electrons in plasmonic material surface. The
metallic electron excitations are modeled using the Hermitian effective
Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system, whereas, the spill-out electron excitations are
modeled via the damped non-Hermitian effective Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system
adapted appropriately at the metal-vacuum interface. It is shows that, when
driven by external field, the system behaves like the driven damped oscillator
in wavenumber domain, quite analogous to the driven damped mechanical
oscillation in frequency domain, leading to the collective surface spill-out
electron excitation resonance. In this model the resonance occurs when the
wavenumber of the driving pseudoforce matches that of the surface plasmon
excitations which can be either due to single-electrons or collective effects.
Current theory of SPR is based on longitudinal electrostatic excitations of the
surface electrons, instead of the polariton excitation parallel to the
metal-dielectric or metal-vacuum surface. Current theory may also be extended
to use for the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in nanometer sized
metallic surfaces in non-planar geometry. A new equation of state (EoS) for the
plasmon electron number density in quantum plasmas is obtained which limits the
plasmonic effects in high-density low-temperature electron gas regime, due to
small transition probability of electrons to the plasmon energy band.

<h3>Observation of ballistic-diffusive thermal transport in GaN transistors  using thermoreflectance thermal imaging</h3>

To develop effective thermal management strategies for GaN transistors, it is
essential to accurately predict the device junction temperature. Since the
width of the heat generation in the devices is comparable to phonon mean free
paths of GaN, phonon ballistic transport exists and can significantly affect
the heat transport process, which necessitates a thorough understanding of the
influence of the phonon ballistic effects in GaN transistors. In this paper,
the ballistic-diffusive phonon transport in GaN-on-SiC devices is examined by
measuring the hotspot temperature using the thermoreflectance thermal imaging
TTI combined with the hybrid phonon Monte Carlo-diffusion simulations. A series
of Au heaters are fabricated on the top of the GaN layer to quantitatively
mimic the different heat source distributions during device operation. The
experimental and simulation results show a good consistency and both indicate
that the phonon ballistic effects can significantly increase the hotspot
temperature. With the size of the heat source decreasing, the errors of
Fourier's law-based predictions increase, which emphasizes the necessity to
carefully consider the phonon ballistic transport in device thermal
simulations.

<h3>Challenging the LÃ©vy Flight Foraging Hypothesis -A Joint Monte Carlo  and Numerical PDE Approach</h3>

For a L\'evy process on the flat torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ with power law jump
length distribution $\sim |x|^{-2-2\alpha}$ for $0<\alpha<1$, Monte Carlo and
finite difference methods for inverting the fractional Laplacian are employed
to confirm recently obtained leading order analytic results for the mean
stopping time $u_\epsilon$ to a circular target of radius $0 <\epsilon \ll 1$.
The Monte Carlo simulations of the L\'evy process rely on a rejection sampling
algorithm to sample from a power law distribution, while the finite difference
method numerically solves the nonlocal exterior problem $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}
u_\epsilon = -1$ with $u_\epsilon = 0$ inside the target. Our results confirm
that the mean stopping time indeed scales as $O(\epsilon^{2\alpha-2})$, in
stark contrast to the well-known $O(|\log\epsilon|)$ scaling of the Brownian
narrow escape time. For a sufficiently small target size, this difference in
scaling implies that a L\'evy search strategy may in fact be (significantly)
slower than a Brownian search strategy.

Recently a two-dimensional chiral fluid was experimentally demonstrated. It
was obtained from cubic-shaped hematite colloidal particles placed in a
rotating magnetic field. Here we look at building blocks of that fluid, by
analyzing short hematite chain behavior in a rotating magnetic field. We find
equilibrium structures of chains in static magnetic fields and observe chain
dynamics in rotating magnetic fields. We find and experimentally verify that
there are three planar motion regimes and one where the cube chain goes out of
the plane of the rotating magnetic field. In this regime we observe interesting
dynamics -- the chain rotates slower than the rotating magnetic field. In order
to catch up with the magnetic field, it rolls on an edge and through rotation
in the third dimension catches up with the magnetic field. The same dynamics is
also observable for a single cube when gravitational effects are explicitly
taken into account.

<h3>Helmholtz Thermodynamics Beyond Hamiltonians: Including Walls, Pressure  and Heat Flow</h3>

<br>
<br>
For 1D Hamiltonian systems with periodic solutions, Helmholtz formalism
provides a tantalizing interpretation of classical thermodynamics, based on
time integrals of purely mechanical quantities and without need of statistical
description. Here we extend this approach to include heat flux and pressure at
the walls, thereby enabling it to describe actual thermodynamic
transformations, such as isothermal compressions and expansions. The presence
of hard walls, which gives rise to non zero pressure, is justified by means of
the virial theorem, while the heat fluxes are introduced as quasi-static limits
of suitably thermostatted Hamiltonians. Particular attention is paid to
generalizing the minimalist cases of the harmonic oscillator and elastic
bouncer, which afford clear physical interpretations. With such extensions, a
complete picture of thermodynamics emerges, amenable to cyclic transformations
capable of producing mechanical work from heat, like the Carnot cycle.

One-dimensional movement of interacting particles is a challenging problem
where the correlation between particles induces non-trivial collective effects.
In contrast to the single-file diffusion case, the pure ballistic single file
movement of particles has received less attention. Here, the ballistic file
diffusion of hard disks is studied using an addaptative continuum Monte Carlo
numerical scheme. Dynamics is studied as a function of the size of the
particles, the system size and the number of particles. The mean square
displacement presents three regimes corresponding to independent motion,
collective motion and finite size effects. These regimes and the crossover
times between them are analyzed and presented in analogy with the ones observed
for the single-file diffusion problem.

The engineering of quantum materials requires the development of tools able
to address various synthesis and characterization challenges. These include the
establishment and refinement of growth methods, material manipulation, and
defect engineering. Material modification at the atomic level will be a key
enabling factor for the engineering of quantum materials where desired
phenomena are critically determined by local atomic structures. Successful use
of scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEMs) for atomic scale material
manipulation has opened the door for a transformed view of what can be
accomplished using electron-beam-based strategies. However, serious obstacles
exist on the pathway from possibility to practical reality. One such obstacle
is the in situ delivery of atomized material in the STEM to the region of
interest for further fabrication processes. Here, we present progress on this
front with a view toward performing synthesis (deposition and growth) processes
in a scanning transmission electron microscope. An in situ thermal deposition
platform is presented, tested, and deposition and growth processes are
demonstrated. In particular, we show that isolated Sn atoms can be evaporated
from a filament and caught on the nearby sample, demonstrating atomized
material delivery. This platform, and future variations, are envisioned to
facilitate real-time atomic resolution imaging of growth processes and open new
pathways toward atomic fabrication.

Finding new ways to tune the behaviour of thermoresponsive microgels in bulk
and at interfaces is key to achieve a deeper understanding and control of these
smart materials. We studied the ionic specificity of a Keggin polyoxometalate
(POM) on positively charged pNIPAM microgels. In bulk, we observed an inversion
of charge and further dehydration in their already collapsed state. At
water/air interfaces, we found a reduction of the microgel diameter and a
collapse of the portion immersed in the water subphase at $10^{-5}$ M. Above
the microgel collapsing temperature, the diameter at the interface did not
change but the portion immersed in the subphase collapsed even more. The
restructuring of the pNIPAM polymeric network by the POM was observed by EDS
mapping and XPS. This restructuring improved the ability of the microgel
monolayers to perform as soft colloidal lithography masks by improving their
resistance to plasma etching.

Topological kagome systems have been a topic of great interest in condensed
matter physics due totheir unique electronic properties. The vanadium-based
kagome materials are particularly intrigu-ing since they exhibit exotic
phenomena such as charge density wave (CDW) and
unconventionalsuperconductivity. The origin of these electronic instabilities
is not fully understood, and the re-cent discovery of a charge density wave in
ScV6Sn6provides a new avenue for investigation. In thiswork, we investigate the
electronic structure of the novel kagome metal ScV6Sn6using angle
resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM), and first-principlesdensity functional theory calculations. Our analysis
reveals for the first time the temperature-dependent band changes of ScV6Sn6and
identifies a new band that exhibits a strong signatureof a structure with CDW
below the critical temperature. Further analysis revealed that this newband is
due to the surface kagome layer of the CDW structure. In addition, a Lifshitz
transition isidentified in the ARPES spectra that is related to the saddle
point moving across the Fermi levelat the critical temperature for the CDW
formation. This result shows the CDW behavior may alsobe related to nesting of
the saddle point, similar to related materials. However, no energy gap is
observed at the Fermi level and thus the CDW is not a typical Fermi surface
nesting scenario. These results provide new insights into the underlying
physics of the CDW in the kagome materials and could have implications for the
development of materials with new functionality.

<h3>Topological Andreev Rectification</h3>

We develop the theory of an Andreev junction, which provides a method to
probe the intrinsic topology of the Fermi sea of a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG). An Andreev junction is a Josephson $\pi$ junction proximitizing a
ballistic 2DEG, and exhibits low-energy Andreev bound states that propagate
$\textit{along}$ the junction. It has been shown that measuring the nonlocal
Landauer conductance due to these Andreev modes in a narrow linear junction
leads to a topological Andreev rectification (TAR) effect characterized by a
quantized conductance that is sensitive to the Euler characteristic $\chi_F$ of
the 2DEG Fermi sea. Here we expand on that analysis and consider more realistic
device geometries that go beyond the narrow linear junction and fully adiabatic
limits considered earlier. Wider junctions exhibit additional Andreev modes
that contribute to the transport and degrade the quantization of the
conductance. Nonetheless, we show that an appropriately defined
$\textit{rectified conductance}$ remains robustly quantized provided large
momentum scattering is suppressed. We verify and demonstrate these predictions
by performing extensive numerical simulations of realistic device geometries.
We introduce a simple model system that demonstrates the robustness of the
rectified conductance for wide linear junctions as well as point contacts, even
when the nonlocal conductance is not quantized. Motivated by recent
experimental advances, we model devices in specific materials, including InAs
quantum wells, as well as monolayer and bilayer graphene. These studies
indicate that for sufficiently ballistic samples observation of the TAR effect
should be within experimental reach.
