<h3>Investigation on Machine Learning Based Approaches for Estimating the  Critical Temperature of Superconductors</h3>

Superconductors have been among the most fascinating substances, as the
fundamental concept of superconductivity as well as the correlation of critical
temperature and superconductive materials have been the focus of extensive
investigation since their discovery. However, superconductors at normal
temperatures have yet to be identified. Additionally, there are still many
unknown factors and gaps of understanding regarding this unique phenomenon,
particularly the connection between superconductivity and the fundamental
criteria to estimate the critical temperature. To bridge the gap, numerous
machine learning techniques have been established to estimate critical
temperatures as it is extremely challenging to determine. Furthermore, the need
for a sophisticated and feasible method for determining the temperature range
that goes beyond the scope of the standard empirical formula appears to be
strongly emphasized by various machine-learning approaches. This paper uses a
stacking machine learning approach to train itself on the complex
characteristics of superconductive materials in order to accurately predict
critical temperatures. In comparison to other previous accessible research
investigations, this model demonstrated a promising performance with an RMSE of
9.68 and an R2 score of 0.922. The findings presented here could be a viable
technique to shed new insight on the efficient implementation of the stacking
ensemble method with hyperparameter optimization (HPO).

Twist-bend (Ntb) and ferroelectric (NF) nematic liquid crystals exhibit
several novel effects and new physical properties. The question of what happens
in binary mixtures is interesting as a matter of curiosity and pure science.
Here, we report experimental studies on the phase diagram and some physical
properties of binary mixtures of the above-mentioned nematic liquid crystals.
Both N-Ntb and N-NF phase transition temperatures and the corresponding
enthalpies decrease significantly and eventually, these transitions disappear
in some intermediate compositions. Temperature dependent birefringence above
the N-Ntb phase transition temperature shows critical behaviour, and the
critical range of the tilt fluctuations becomes wider in the mixtures. The
magnitudes and the temperature dependence of the splay elastic constant of the
mixtures' high-temperature nematic (N) phase strikingly differ from that of the
pristine twist-bend and ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals. The study shows
that Ntb and NF liquid crystals are incompatible.

We review the recent advances and current challenges in the field of strong
spin-orbit coupled Kitaev materials, with a particular emphasis on the physics
beyond the exactly-solvable Kitaev spin liquid point. To that end, we give a
comprehensive overview of the most relevant exchange interactions in $d^5$ and
$d^7$ iridates and similar compounds, an exposition of their microscopic
origin, and a systematic attempt to map out the most interesting correlated
regimes of the multi-dimensional parameter space, guided by powerful symmetry
and duality transformations as well as by insights from wide-ranging analytical
and numerical studies. We also survey recent exciting results on quasi-1D
models and discuss their relevance to higher-dimensional models. Finally, we
highlight some of the key questions in the field as well as future directions.

<h3>Large $N$ theory of critical Fermi surfaces III: Cyclotron Resonance and  Quantum Oscillation</h3>

Kohn's theorem places strong constraints on the cyclotron response of Fermi
liquids. Recent observations of a doping dependence in the cyclotron mass of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (Legros et al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 195110 (2022)) are
therefore surprising because the cyclotron mass can only be renormalized by
large momentum umklapp interactions which are not expected to vary
significantly with doping. We show that a version of Kohn's theorem continues
to apply to disorder-free non-Fermi liquids with a critical boson near zero
momentum. However, marginal Fermi liquids arising from a spatially random
Yukawa coupling between the electrons and bosons do give rise to significant
corrections to the cyclotron mass which we compute. This is the same theory
which yields linear-in-temperature resistivity and other properties of strange
metals at zero fields (Patel et al., arXiv:2203.04990).

<h3>Quasispins of vacancy defects in Ising chains with nearest- and  next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01959</a>
<br>
<i>Shijun Sun, Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by frustrated magnets and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials,
we study the magnetic properties of 1D Ising chains with nearest-neighbour (NN)
and weaker next-to-nearest neighbour (NNN) interactions in the presence of
vacancy defects. The effect of a vacancy on the magnetic susceptibility of a
spin chain is two-fold: it reduces the length of the chain by an effective
''vacancy size'' and may also act as a free spin, a ''quasispin'', with a
Curie-type $\chi_\text{quasi}=\langle S^2\rangle/T$ contribution to the
susceptibility. In chains with antiferromagnetic short-range order, the
susceptibility of vacancy-free chains is exponentially suppressed at low
temperatures, and quasispins dominate the effect of impurities on the chains'
magnetic properties. For chains with antiferromagnetic NN interactions, the
quasispin matches the value $\langle S^2\rangle=1$ of the Ising spins in the
chain for ferromagnetic NNN interactions and vanishes for antiferromagnetic NNN
interactions. For chains with ferromagnetic short-range order, quasispin
effects are insignificant due to exponentially large low-temperature
susceptibilities, and the dominant effect of a vacancy is effectively changing
the length of the chain.

<h3>Semi-classical theory of bipolaronic superconductivity in a  bond-modulated electron-phonon model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01961</a>
<br>
<i>Kyung-Su Kim, Zhaoyu Han, John Sous</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the transition temperature $T_c$ of bipolaronic superconductivity
in a bond Peierls, also known as, Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (bond-SSH) model where
the electron hoppings are modulated by bond phonons. Using a semi-classical
instanton approximation justifiable in the adiabatic limit of slow phonons, we
find that the bipolaron mass is only weakly enhanced, in contrast to the
typical large mass enhancement found in standard (Holstein) electron-phonon
models. Specifically, in the strong-coupling limit, the bipolarons can freely
slide within a degenerate manifold rather than become self-trapped. A gas of
these bipolarons can undergo a superfluid transition at a critical temperature
for which we derive an upper bound. We find that this bound is exponentially
larger than that in the Holstein model. Our study may provide an analytical
understanding of the mechanism behind the high-$T_c$ bipolaronic
superconductivity numerically observed in [Phys. Rev. X 13, 011010 (2023)].

<h3>Signature of Criticality in Angular Momentum Resolved Entanglement of  Scalar Fields in $d>1$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01964</a>
<br>
<i>Mrinal Kanti Sarkar, Saranyo Moitra, Rajdeep Sensarma</i>
<br>
<br>
The scaling of entanglement entropy with subsystem size fails to distinguish
between gapped and gapless ground state of a scalar field theory in $d>1$
dimensions. We show that the scaling of angular momentum resolved entanglement
entropy $S_\ell$ with the subsystem radius $R$ can clearly distinguish between
these states. For a massless theory with momentum cut-off $\Lambda$, $S_\ell
\sim \ln [\Lambda R/\ell]$ for $\Lambda R \gg \ell$, while $S_\ell \sim R^0$
for the massive theory. In contrast, for a free Fermi gas with Fermi wave
vector $k_F$, $S_\ell \sim \ln [k_F R]$ for $k_F R \gg \ell$. We show how this
leads to an ``area-log'' scaling of total entanglement entropy of Fermions,
while the extra factor of $\ell$ leads to a leading area law even for massless
Bosons.

<h3>Can Majorana zero modes in quantum Hall edges survive edge  reconstruction?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01980" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01980</a>
<br>
<i>Kishore Iyer, Amulya Ratnakar, Sumathi Rao, Sourin Das</i>
<br>
<br>
Parafermion zero modes can be trapped in the domain walls of quantum Hall
edges proximitized by superconductors and ferromagnets. The $\nu = 1/3$
fractional quantum Hall side strip arising due to edge reconstruction of a $\nu
= 1$ edge doubles the number of topological sectors such that each of them is
$Z_{2} \times Z_{2}$ degenerate. The many-body spectrum displays a $4\pi$
Josephson periodicity, with the states in each $Z_{2}$ being energetically
decoupled. Signatures of the new states appear in the fractional Josephson
current when the edge velocities are taken to be different.

<h3>Metastability and dynamics in remanent states of square artificial spin  ice with long-range dipole interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01985" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01985</a>
<br>
<i>G. M. Wysin</i>
<br>
<br>
After removal of an applied magnetic field, artificial square spin ice can be
left in a metastable remanent state, with nonzero residual magnetization and
excess energy above the ground state. Using a model of magnetic islands with
dipoles of fixed magnitude and local anisotropies, the remanent states are
precisely determined here, including all long-range dipole interactions. Small
deviations away from remanent states are analyzed and the frequencies of modes
of oscillation are determined. Some modes reach zero frequency at high symmetry
wave vectors, such that the stability limits are found, as determined by the
local anisotropy strength relative to the dipolar coupling strength.

<h3>Accelerated Organic Crystal Structure Prediction with Genetic Algorithms  and Machine Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01993" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01993</a>
<br>
<i>Amit Kadan, Kevin Ryczko, Andrew Wildman, Rodrigo Wang, Adrian Roitberg, Takeshi Yamazaki</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a high-throughput, end-to-end pipeline for organic crystal
structure prediction (CSP) -- the problem of identifying the stable crystal
structures that will form from a given molecule based only on its molecular
composition. Our tool uses Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) to allow for
efficient screening and structural relaxations of generated crystal candidates.
Our pipeline consists of two distinct stages -- random search, whereby crystal
candidates are randomly generated and screened, and optimization, where a
genetic algorithm (GA) optimizes this screened population. We assess the
performance of each stage of our pipeline on 21 targets taken from the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre's CSP blind tests. We show that random
search alone yields matches for $\approx50\%$ of candidates. We then validate
the potential of our full pipeline, making use of the GA to optimize the
Root-Mean-Square Distance (RMSD) between crystal candidates and the
experimentally derived structure. With this approach, we are able to find
matches for $\approx80\%$ of candidates with 10-100 times smaller initial
population sizes than when using random search. Lastly, we run our full
pipeline with an ANI model that is trained on a small dataset of molecules
extracted from crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database,
generating $\approx60\%$ of targets. By leveraging ML models trained to predict
energies at the DFT level, our pipeline has the potential to approach the
accuracy of $\textit{ab initio}$ methods, while being as efficient as solutions
based on empirical force-fields.

<h3>Andreev spin-noise detector</h3>

<br>

<br>
We investigate the possibility to employ magnetic Josephson junctions as
magnetic-noise detectors. To illustrate our idea, we consider a system
consisting of a quantum dot coupled to superconducting leads in the presence of
an external magnetic field. Under appropriate assumptions, we relate the noise
in the Josephson current to magnetization noise. At the magnetic field driven
$0-\pi$ transition the junction sensitivity as magnetic noise detector is
strongly enhanced and it diverges in the zero temperature limit. Moreover, we
demonstrate that, if also dot energy is affected by fluctuations, only the
magnetic noise channel contributes to Josephson current noise response when the
quantum dot is tuned in resonance with superconducting leads.

<h3>Unconventional Metallic Magnetism: Non-analyticity and Sign-changing  Behavior of Orbital Magnetization in ABC Trilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01996</a>
<br>
<i>Mainak Das, Chunli Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
We study an unique form of metallic ferromagnetism in which orbital moments
surpasses the role of spin moments in shaping the overall magnetization. This
system emerges naturally upon doping a topologically non-trivial Chern band in
the recently identified quarter metal phase of rhombohedral trilayer graphene.
Our comprehensive scan of the density-interlayer potential parameter space
reveals an unexpected landscape of orbital magnetization marked by two sign
changes and a line of singularities. The sign change originates from an intense
Berry curvature concentrated close to the band-edge, and the singularity arises
from a topological Lifshitz transition that transform a simply connected Fermi
sea into an annular Fermi sea. Importantly, these variations occur while the
groundstate order-parameter (i.e.~valley and spin polarization) remains
unchanged. This unconventional relationship between the order parameter and
magnetization markedly contrasts traditional spin ferromagnets, where spin
magnetization is simply proportional to the groundstate spin polarization via
the gyromagnetic ratio. We compute energy and magnetization curves as functions
of collective valley rotation to shed light on magnetization dynamics and to
expand the Stoner-Wohlfarth magnetization reversal model. We provide
predictions on the magnetic coercive field that can be readily tested in
experiments. Our results challenge established perceptions of magnetism,
emphasising the important role of orbital moments in two-dimensional materials
such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, and in turn, expand our
understanding and potential manipulation of magnetic behaviors in these
systems.

<h3>The correlated insulators of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene at  zero and one quantum of magnetic flux: a tight-binding study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01997" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01997</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, Tobias Stauber</i>
<br>
<br>
Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has become one of the prominent
topics in Condensed Matter during the last few years, however, fully atomistic
studies of the interacting physics are missing. In this work, we study the
correlated insulator states of MATBG in the setting of a tight-binding model,
under a perpendicular magnetic field of $0$ and $26.5$ T, corresponding to zero
and one quantum of magnetic flux per unit cell. At zero field and for dopings
of two holes ($\nu=-2$) or two electrons ($\nu=+2$) per unit cell, the Kramers
intervalley coherent (KIVC) order is the ground state at the Hartree-Fock
level, although it is stabilized by a different mechanism to that in continuum
model. At charge neutrality, the spin polarized state is competitive with the
KIVC due to the on-site Hubbard energy. We obtain a strongly electron-hole
asymmetric phase diagram with robust insulators for electron filling and metals
for negative filling. In the presence of magnetic flux, we predict an insulator
with Chern number $-2$ for $\nu=-2$, a spin polarized state at charge
neutrality and competing insulators with Chern numbers $+2$ and $0$ at
$\nu=+2$. The stability of the $\nu=+2$ insulators is determined by the
screening environment, allowing for the possibility of observing a topological
phase transition.

<h3>Real-time two-axis control of a spin qubit</h3>

<br>
<br>
Optimal control of qubits requires the ability to adapt continuously to their
ever-changing environment. We demonstrate a real-time control protocol for a
two-electron singlet-triplet qubit with two fluctuating Hamiltonian parameters.
Our approach leverages single-shot readout classification and dynamic waveform
generation, allowing full Hamiltonian estimation to dynamically stabilize and
optimize the qubit performance. Powered by a field-programmable gate array
(FPGA), the quantum control electronics estimates the Overhauser field gradient
between the two electrons in real time, enabling controlled Overhauser-driven
spin rotations and thus bypassing the need for micromagnets or nuclear
polarization protocols. It also estimates the exchange interaction between the
two electrons and adjusts their detuning, resulting in extended coherence of
Hadamard rotations when correcting for fluctuations of both qubit axes. Our
study emphasizes the critical role of feedback in enhancing the performance and
stability of quantum devices affected by quasistatic noise. Feedback will play
an essential role in improving performance in various qubit implementations
that go beyond spin qubits, helping realize the full potential of quantum
devices for quantum technology applications.

<h3>Thermal pure matrix product state in two dimensions: tracking thermal  equilibrium from paramagnet down to the Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02015" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02015</a>
<br>
<i>Matthias Gohlke, Atsushi Iwaki, Chisa Hotta</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the matrix product state (MPS) provides a thermal quantum pure
state (TPQ) representation in equilibrium in two spatial dimensions over the
whole temperature range. We use the Kitaev honeycomb model as a prominent
example hosting a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state to target the two
specific-heat peaks previously solved nearly exactly using the free Majorana
fermionic description. Starting from the high-temperature random state, our
TPQ-MPS wrapping the cylinder precisely reproduces these peaks, showing that
the quantum many-body description based on spins can still capture the emergent
itinerant Majorana fermions in a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge field. The truncation
process efficiently discards the high-energy states, eventually reaching the
long-range entangled topological state.

<h3>A Compact Model of Threshold Switching Devices for Efficient Circuit  Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02017" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02017</a>
<br>
<i>Mohamad Moner Al Chawa, Daniel Bedau, Ahmet S. Demirkol, James W. Reiner, Derek A. Stewart, Michael K. Grobis, Ronald Tetzlaff</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we present a new compact model of threshold switching devices
which is suitable for efficient circuit-level simulations. First, a macro
model, based on a compact transistor based circuit, was implemented in LTSPICE.
Then, a descriptive model was extracted and implemented in MATLAB, which is
based on the macro model. This macro model was extended to develop a physical
model that describes the processes that occur during the threshold switching.
The physical model derived comprises a delay structure with few electrical
components adjacent to the second junction. The delay model incorporates an
internal state variable, which is crucial to transform the descriptive model
into a compact model and to parameterize it in terms of electrical parameters
that represent the component's behavior. Finally, we applied our model by
fitting measured i-v data of an OTS device manufactured by Western Digital
Research.

<h3>Classical derivation of Bose-Einstein statistics</h3>

<br>
<br>
When its temperature is low enough, the motion of any stable classical
mechanical system is a superposition of {\em quasi}-independent harmonic
oscillations of its normal modes, which are standing waves if the system is a
crystal or a bounded continuous medium. Without invoking quantum mechanics I
prove that, at thermal equilibrium, the observed distribution of energy among
these oscillations is a Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with an unknown
constant $h_?$ in place of Planck's constant, $h$. I identify characteristics
of the classical independent-oscillator Hamiltonian that make my derivation of
the Bose-Einstein distribution possible, and I point out that other classical
physical systems, such as an ideal gas, have Hamiltonians that can be
transformed canonically into forms with these characteristics. If ${h_?=h}$,
among the implications of this work are that (i) there is no discrepancy
between the experimentally-observed spectrum of a blackbody and what should be
expected if light was a mechanical wave in a bounded medium; (ii) there is no
discrepancy between the experimentally-observed temperature dependence of a
crystal's heat capacity and what should be expected of classical lattice waves;
and (iii) when a cluster of massive particles is cold enough, the classical
expectation should be that almost all of its vibrational energy is possessed by
its lowest-frequency normal mode. Therefore, below a certain temperature, all
but one of its degrees of freedom are almost inactive and it is a Bose-Einstein
condensate.

<h3>Microscopic Gyration with Dissipative Coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02085" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02085</a>
<br>
<i>Soham Dutta, Arnab Saha</i>
<br>
<br>
Microscopic gyrators, including Brownian gyrators (BGs), require anisotropic
fluctuations to perform gyration. It produces a finite current, driving the
system out of equilibrium. In a typical BG set-up with an isotropic colloidal
particle, the anisotropy sets in by the coupling among space dimensions via an
externally applied anisotropic potential confining the particle and the
difference between the temperatures along various space dimensions. The
coupling is conservative. Here, contrary to a typical BG, first we consider an
over-damped, anisotropic colloidal particle (a Brownian ellipsoid), trapped in
an isotropic harmonic potential in two dimensions (2D). The space dimensions
are coupled by the difference between the longitudinal and transverse
frictional drags experienced by the ellipsoid, together with a finite tilt in
its orientation due to its chirality. The coupling is dissipative. They are
intrinsic properties of the particle. We have shown that this dissipative
coupling can generate enough anisotropic fluctuations to perform a steady-state
gyration in the Brownian scale. Next, going beyond BG, we have considered an
inertial, granular, chiral ellipsoid in 2D, subjected to athermal, anisotropic
fluctuations. There is no trapping force confining the granular ellipsoid.
However, the coupling between the velocity components of the granular ellipsoid
is still dissipative. We have shown that being assisted by the dissipative
coupling and the anisotropic fluctuations, the inertial, granular ellipsoid can
also perform gyration in 2D. We have also shown that the dominant contribution
towards the gyrating frequency can be attributed to the Coriolis force acting
on the granular ellipsoid. Hence, the gyrator in the granular scale is also a
tiny autonomous machine that generates a directed motion (gyration) from
fluctuations. Although there are fundamental differences between the two.

<h3>Optimal lattice depth on lifetime of D-band ultracold atoms in a  triangular optical lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a flexible and effective platform for
quantum precision measurement, and the lifetime of high-band atoms is an
essential parameter for the performance of quantum sensors. In this work, we
investigate the relationship between the lattice depth and the lifetime of
D-band atoms in a triangular optical lattice and show that there is an optimal
lattice depth for the maximum lifetime. After loading the Bose Einstein
condensate into D-band of optical lattice by shortcut method, we observe the
atomic distribution in quasi-momentum space for the different evolution time,
and measure the atomic lifetime at D-band with different lattice depths. The
lifetime is maximized at an optimal lattice depth, where the overlaps between
the wave function of D-band and other bands (mainly S-band) are minimized.
Additionally, we discuss the influence of atomic temperature on lifetime. These
experimental results are in agreement with our numerical simulations. This work
paves the way to improve coherence properties of optical lattices, and
contributes to the implications for the development of quantum precision
measurement, quantum communication, and quantum computing.

<h3>Effect of Pb addition on microstructure, transport properties and the  critical current density in a polycrystalline FeSe0.5Te0.5</h3>

<br>
<i>Shiv J. Singh, Ryszard Diduszko, Przemysław Iwanowski, Tomasz Cetner, Andrzej Wisniewski, Andrzej Morawski</i>
<br>
<br>
We have investigated the effects of lead (Pb) additions (x) up to 40 wt.% (x
= 0-0.4) on the structure, electrical properties, and magnetic properties of
FeSe0.5Te0.5 superconductor. The samples were prepared by the solid-state
reaction method and characterized by various techniques. The parent compound (x
= 0) showed the onset temperature Tc onset of 15 K, and zero-resistance
temperature, Tc offset of 12 K. The addition of Pb enhances the metallic
characteristics of FeSe0.5Te0.5, but both Tc onset and Tc offset are decreased
to the lower temperature with the broadened transition width. The Tc onset is
nearly the same (10.3 K) at higher additions, such as x = 0.3 and 0.4, but zero
resistivity is not observed up to 7 K. Microstructural analysis and transport
studies suggest that for x > 0.05, Pb additions weakened the coupling between
grains and suppressed the superconducting percolation, leading to a broad
transition. More importantly, the inclusion of a relatively small amount of Pb
(x = 0.05) increased the critical current density, Jc, in the entire magnetic
field, which might be attributable to better phase uniformity as well as good
grain connectivity.

<br>
<br>
The joint effects of Kekul\'e lattice distortions and Rashba-type spin-orbit
coupling on the electronic properties of graphene are explored. We modeled the
position dependence of the Rashba energy term in a manner that allows its
seamless integration into the scheme introduced by Gamayun et al.[New J. Phys.
20, 023016 (2018)] to describe graphene with Kekul\'e lattice distortion.
Particularly for the Kekul\'e-Y texture, the effective low energy Dirac
Hamiltonian contains a new spin-valley locking term, in addition to the
well-known Rashba-induced momentum-pseudospin and spin-pseudospin couplings,
and the Kekul\'e-induced momentum-valley coupling term. We report on the
low-energy band structure and Landau level spectra of Rashba-spin-orbit-coupled
Kek-Y graphene, and propose an experimental scheme to discern between the
presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Kek-Y lattice distortion, and both,
based on doping-dependent magnetotransport measurements.

We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous
dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary
transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly
constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the
Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides,
Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose
expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these
consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a
nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin
models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for
Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy
diagrams.

Modulation of thermal conductivity has become a hotspot in the field of heat
conduction. A novel strategy based on targeted phonon excitation has been
recently proposed for efficient and reversible modulation of thermal
conductivity. In this article, the effectiveness of that strategy is further
evaluated on hexagonal boron nitride through ab initio methods. Results
indicate that thermal conductivity can be increased from 885 W m-1 K-1 to 1151
W m-1 K-1 or decreased to 356 W m-1 K-1, thereby broadening the scope of
applicability of this strategy.

<h3>First-principle study of spin transport property in  $L1_0$-FePd(001)/graphene heterojunction</h3>

<br>
In our previous work, we synthesized a metal/2D material heterointerface
consisting of $L1_0$-ordered iron-palladium (FePd) and graphene (Gr) called
FePd(001)/Gr. This system has been explored by both experimental measurements
and theoretical calculations. In this study, we focus on a heterojunction
composed of FePd and multilayer graphene referred to as
FePd(001)/$m$-Gr/FePd(001), where $m$ represents the number of graphene layers.
We perform first-principles calculations to predict their spin-dependent
transport properties. The quantitative calculations of spin-resolved
conductance and magnetoresistance (MR) ratio (150-200%) suggest that the
proposed structure can function as a magnetic tunnel junction in spintronics
applications. We also find that an increase in $m$ not only reduces conductance
but also changes transport properties from the tunneling behavior to the
graphite $\pi$-band-like behavior. Furthermore, we examine the impact of
lateral displacements (sliding) at the interface and find that the spin
transport properties remain robust despite these changes; this is the advantage
of two-dimensional material hetero-interfaces over traditional insulating
barrier layers such as MgO.

We propose that the spin pumping effect is a valuable probe to non-Fermi
liquid (NFL) metals in correlated electron systems. In a bilayer structure
composed of a NFL metal and a ferromagnetic insulator subjected to ac magnetic
field, the precessing spins in the FI inject spin current into the NFL metal,
which modulates the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) as a backaction. For NFL
metals in the vicinity of a quantum critical point, the FMR modulation shows
power-law scaling with the frequency and the temperature, which is closely
related to the quantum critical behavior and reflects the non-quasiparticle
nature of spin relaxation in NFL metals.

We report the quantum transport properties of the $\alpha$-Sn films grown on
CdTe (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. The $\alpha$-Sn films are
doped with phosphorus to tune the Fermi level and access the bulk state. Clear
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations can be observed below 30 K and a nontrivial
Berry phase has been confirmed. A nearly spherical Fermi surface has been
demonstrated by angle-dependent oscillation frequencies. In addition, the sign
of negative magnetoresistance which is attributed to the chiral anomaly has
also been observed. These results provide strong evidence of the
three-dimensional Dirac semimetal phase in $\alpha$-Sn.

The functionality of atomic quantum emitters is intrinsically linked to their
host lattice coordination. Structural distortions that spontaneously break the
lattice symmetry strongly impact their optical emission properties and
spin-photon interface. Here we report on the direct imaging of charge
state-dependent symmetry breaking of two prototypical atomic quantum emitters
in mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM). By substrate chemical gating
different charge states of sulfur vacancies (Vac$_\text{S}$) and substitutional
rhenium dopants (Re$_\text{Mo}$) can be stabilized. Vac$_\text{S}^{-1}$ as well
as Re$_\text{Mo}^{0}$ and Re$_\text{Mo}^{-1}$ exhibit local lattice distortions
and symmetry-broken defect orbitals attributed to a Jahn-Teller effect (JTE)
and pseudo-JTE, respectively. By mapping the electronic and geometric structure
of single point defects, we disentangle the effects of spatial averaging,
charge multistability, configurational dynamics, and external perturbations
that often mask the presence of local symmetry breaking.

Comprehending nonequilibrium electron-phonon dynamics at the microscopic
level and at the short time scales is one of the main goals in condensed matter
physics. Effective temperature models and time-dependent Boltzmann equations
are standard techniques for exploring and understanding nonequilibrium state
and the corresponding scattering channels. However, these methods consider only
the time evolution of carrier occupation function, while the self-consistent
phonon dressing in each time instant coming from the nonequilibrium population
is ignored, which makes them less suitable for studying ultrafast phenomena
where softening of the phonon modes plays an active role. Here, we combine
ab-initio time-dependent Boltzmann equations and many-body phonon self-energy
calculations to investigate the full momentum- and mode-resolved nonadiabatic
phonon renormalization picture in the MoS$_2$ monolayer under nonequilibrium
conditions. Our results show that the nonequilibrium state of photoexcited
MoS$_2$ is governed by multi-valley topology of valence and conduction bands
that brings about characteristic anisotropic electron-phonon thermalization
paths and the corresponding phonon renormalization of strongly-coupled modes
around high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. As the carrier population is
thermalized towards its equilibrium state, we track in time the evolution of
the remarkable phonon anomalies induced by nonequilibrium and the overall
enhancement of the phonon relaxation rates. This work shows potential
guidelines to tailor the electron-phonon relaxation channels and control the
phonon dynamics under extreme photoexcited conditions.

We discuss the instability of uniform superconducting states that contain the
pairing correlations belonging to the odd-frequency symmetry class. The
instability originates from the paramagnetic response of odd-frequency Cooper
pairs and is considerable at finite temperatures. As a result, the pair
potential varies discontinuously at the transition temperature when the
amplitude of the odd-frequency pairing correlation functions is sufficiently
large. The discontinuous transition to the superconducting phase is a general
feature of superconductors that include odd-frequency Cooper pairs.

A semi-Markov process method for obtaining general counting statistics for
open quantum systems is extended to the scenario of resetting. The simultaneous
presence of random resets and wave function collapses means that the quantum
jump trajectories are no longer semi-Markov. However, focusing on trajectories
and using simple probability formulas, general counting statistics can still be
constructed from reset-free statistics. An exact tilted matrix equation is also
obtained. The inputs of these methods are the survival distributions and
waiting-time density distributions instead of quantum operators. In addition, a
continuous-time cloning algorithm is introduced to simulate the large-deviation
properties of open quantum systems. Several quantum optics systems are used to
demonstrate these results.

Wet chemistry C-S-H precipitation experiments were performed under controlled
conditions of solution supersaturation in the presence and absence of gluconate
and three hexitol molecules. Characterization of the precipitates with SAXS and
cryo-TEM experiments confirmed the presence of a multi-step nucleation pathway.
Induction times for the formation of the amorphous C-S-H spheroids were
determined from light transmittance. Analysis of those data with the classical
nucleation theory revealed a significant increase of the kinetic prefactor in
the same order as the complexation constants of calcium and silicate with each
of the organics. Finally, two distinct precipitation regimes of the C-S-H
amorphous precursor were identified: i) a nucleation regime at low saturation
indexes (SI) and ii) a spinodal nucleation regime at high SI where the free
energy barrier to the phase transition is found to be of the order of the
kinetic energy or less.

We will study a class of system composed of interacting quantum dots (QDs)
placed in contact with a hot and cold thermal baths subjected to a
non-conservative driving worksource. Despite their simplicity, these models
showcase an intricate array of phenomena, including pump and heat engine
regimes as well as a discontinuous phase transition. We will look at three
distinctive topologies: a minimal and beyond minimal (homogeneous and
heterogeneous interaction structures). The former case is represented by stark
different networks ("all-to-all" interactions and only a central interacting to
its neighbors) and present exact solutions, whereas homogeneous and
heterogeneous structures have been analyzed by numerical simulations. We find
that the topology plays a major role on the thermodynamic performance if the
individual energies of the quantum dots are small, in part due to the presence
of first-order phase-transitions. If the individual energies are large, the
topology is not important and results are well-described by a system with
all-to-all interactions.

<h3>Disorder-Induced Phase Transitions in Three-Dimensional Chiral  Second-Order Topological Insulator</h3>

Topological insulators have been extended to higher-order versions that
possess topological hinge or corner states in lower dimensions. However, their
robustness against disorder is still unclear. Here, we theoretically
investigate the phase transitions of three-dimensional (3D) chiral second-order
topological insulator (SOTI) in the presence of disorders. Our results show
that, by increasing disorder strength, the nonzero densities of states of side
surface and bulk emerge at critical disorder strengths of $W_{S}$ and $W_{B}$,
respectively. The spectral function indicates that the bulk gap is only closed
at one of the $R_{4z}\mathcal{T}$-invariant points, i.e., $\Gamma_{3}$. The
closing of side surface gap or bulk gap is ascribed to the significant decrease
of the elastic mean free time of quasi-particles. Because of the localization
of side surface states, we find that the 3D chiral SOTI is robust at an
averaged quantized conductance of $2e^{2}/h$ with disorder strength up to
$W_{B}$. When the disorder strength is beyond $W_{B}$, the 3D chiral SOTI is
then successively driven into two phases, i.e., diffusive metallic phase and
Anderson insulating phase. Furthermore, an averaged conductance plateau of
$e^{2}/h$ emerges in the diffusive metallic phase.

Co-existence of phase segregation and \emph{interconversion} or
\emph{isomerization} reaction among molecular species leads to fascinating
structure formation in biological and chemical world. Using Monte Carlo
simulations of the prototype Ising model, we explore the chemical kinetics of
such a system consisting of a binary mixture of \emph{isomers}. Our results
reveal that even though the two concerned processes are individually Arrhenius
in nature, the Arrhenius behavior of the \emph{isomerization} reaction gets
significantly disrupted due to an interplay of the nonconserved dynamics of the
reaction and the conserved diffusive dynamics of phase segregation. The
approach used here can be potentially adapted to understand reaction kinetics
of more complex reactions.

<h3>Topological Mott insulator in odd-integer filled Anderson lattice model  with Hatsugai-Kohmoto interactions</h3>

Recently, quantum anomalous Hall state at odd integer filling in moir\'e
stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ has been convincingly interpreted as a topological
Mott insulator state appearing due to strong interactions in {\it band} basis
[arXiv:2210.11486]. In this work, we aim to analyze the formation of a
topological Mott insulator due to interactions in {\it orbital} basis instead,
being more natural for systems where interactions originate from the character
of $f$ or $d$ orbitals rather than band flatness. For that reason, we study an
odd-integer filled Anderson lattice model incorporating odd-parity
hybridization between orbitals with different degrees of correlations
introduced in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto spirit. We demonstrate that a topological
Mott insulating state can be realized in a considered model only when weak
intra- and inter-orbital correlations involving dispersive states are taken
into account. Interestingly, we find that all topological transitions between
trivial and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological Mott insulating phases are not
accompanied by a spectral gap closing, consistently with a phenomenon called
{\it first-order topological transition}. Instead, they are signaled by a kink
developed in spectral function at one of the time reversal invariant momenta.
We believe that our approach can provide insightful phenomenology of
topological Mott insulators in spin-orbit coupled $f$ or $d$ electron systems.

Mexican-hat-shaped quartic dispersion manifests itself in certain families of
single-layer twodimensional hexagonal crystals such as compounds of groups
III-VI and groups IV-V as well as elemental crystals of group V. Quartic band
forms the valence band edge in various of these structures, and some of the
experimentally confirmed structures are GaS, GaSe, InSe, SnSb and blue
phosphorene. Here, we numerically investigate strictly-one-dimensional (1D) and
quasi-one dimensional (Q1D) nanoribbons with quartic dispersion and
systematically study the effects of Anderson disorder on their transport
properties with the help of a minimal tight-binding model and Landauer
formalism. We compare the analytical expression for the scaling function with
simulation data to deduce about the domains of diffusion and localization
regimes. In 1D, it is shown that conductance drops dramatically at the quartic
band edge compared to a quadratic band. As for the Q1D nanoribbons, a set of
singularities emerge close to the band edge, which suppress conductance and
lead to short mean-free-paths and localization lengths. Interestingly, wider
nanoribbons can have shorter mean-free-paths because of denser singularities.
However, the localization lengths do not necessarily follow the same trend. The
results display the peculiar effects of quartic dispersion on transport in
disordered systems.

A study on the optimization of ambient temperature growth and superconducting
properties of Ti-V alloy thin films grown on SiO2-coated Si substrate is
reported here. These films have been synthesized by co-sputtering of Ti and V
targets, and films having different Ti concentrations were deposited to get the
optimized critical temperature (TC) of thin films close to the bulk value. The
maximum TC of 5.2 K has been obtained in the Ti40V60 composition, which is
further increased to 6.2 K when a 10 nm thick Ti underlayer is added below the
Ti-V film. GIXRD measurements confirm the formation of Ti-V alloys in the
desired crystal structure. The upper critical field (HC2) of the thin films has
been estimated with the help of magnetotransport measurements. The utility of
Ti-V alloy thin films in superconducting radiation detection applications is
ascertained.

We study the temperature evolution of quasiparticles in the correlated metal
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our angle resolved photoemission data show that quasiparticles
persist up to temperatures above 200~K, far beyond the Fermi liquid regime.
Extracting the quasiparticle self-energy we demonstrate that the quasiparticle
residue $Z$ increases with increasing temperature. Quasiparticles eventually
disappear on approaching the bad metal state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ not by losing
weight but via excessive broadening from super-Planckian scattering. We further
show that the Fermi surface of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ - defined as the loci where the
spectral function peaks - deflates with increasing temperature. These findings
are in semi-quantitative agreement with dynamical mean field theory
calculations.

We study the intrinsic spin Hall effect of a Dirac Hamiltonian system with
ferromagnetic exchange coupling, a minimal model combining relativistic
spin-orbit interaction and ferromagnetism. The energy bands of the Dirac
Hamiltonian are split after introducing a Stoner-type ferromagnetic ordering
which breaks the spherical symmetry of pristine Dirac model. The totally
antisymmetric spin Hall conductivity (SHC) tensor becomes axially anisotropic
along the direction of external electric field. Interestingly, the anisotropy
does not vanish in the asymptotic limit of zero magnetization. We show that the
ferromagnetic ordering breaks the spin degeneracy of the eigenfunctions and
modifies the selection rules of the interband transitions for the intrinsic
spin Hall effect. The difference in the selection rule between the pristine and
the ferromagnetic Dirac phases causes the anisotropy of the SHC, resulting in a
discontinuity of the SHC as the magnetization, directed orthogonal to the
electric field, is reduced to zero in the ferromagnetic Dirac phase and enters
the pristine Dirac phase.

Soft composite solids are made of dispersed inclusions within soft matrices.
They are ubiquitous in nature and form the basis of many biological tissues. In
the field of materials science, synthetic soft composites are promising
candidates for constructing various engineering devices due to their highly
programmable features. However, when the volume fraction of inclusions
increases, predicting the mechanical properties of these materials poses a
significant challenge for the classical theories in composite mechanics. The
difficulty arises from the inherently disordered, multi-scale interactions
between the inclusions and matrix. To address this challenge, we conducted
systematic investigations on the mechanics of densely-filled soft elastomers
containing stiff microspheres. We experimentally demonstrated how the
strain-stiffening response of the soft composites is governed by the critical
scalings in the vicinity of a continuous phase transition, which depend on both
the elasticity of the elastomer matrix and the particles. The critical points
signify a shear-jamming transition of the included particles in the absence of
matrix elasticity. The proposed criticality framework quantitatively predicts
diverse mechanical responses observed in experiments across a wide range of
material parameters. The findings uncover a novel design paradigm of composite
mechanics that relies on engineering the jamming-criticality of the embedded
inclusions.

We study the interplay of lattice, spin and orbital degrees of freedom in a

surface. The atomic structure of the Te monolayer is determined by scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) and quantitative low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED-IV). Using spin- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)
and density functional theory (DFT), we observe a Te-Au interface state with
highly anisotropic Rashba-type spin-orbit splitting at the X point of the
Brillouin zone. Based on a profound symmetry and tight-binding analysis, we
show how in-plane square lattice symmetry and broken inversion symmetry at the
Te-Au interface together enforce a remarkably anisotropic orbital Rashba effect
which strongly modulates the spin splitting.

The behavior of the topological index, characterizing the properties of
superconducting phases of quasi-two-dimensional systems with nontrivial
topology, is investigated depending on the temperature and parameters of the
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. For this purpose, a method of calculating
the topological index, based on a self-consistent functional-integral theory,
is proposed. The method makes it possible to take into account thermal
fluctuations and study the behavior of the topological index as a function of
temperature and Hamiltonian parameters. The chiral d+id superconducting phase
of a quasi-two-dimensional model with effective attraction between the
electrons located at the nearest sites of a triangular lattice is considered.
It is shown that the characteristic features in the energy dependence of the
self-energy part, which arise when thermal fluctuations are taken into account,
have a structure that does not lead to a change in the topological properties
of the system. It is found that thermal fluctuations, as well as an increase in
effective attraction in this system, contribute to the expansion of the
temperature region, in which the value of the topological index is close to the
integer C1=-2.

Quantum links can interconnect qubit registers and are therefore essential in
networked quantum computing. Semiconductor quantum dot qubits have seen
significant progress in the high-fidelity operation of small qubit registers
but establishing a compelling quantum link remains a challenge. Here, we show
that a spin qubit can be shuttled through multiple quantum dots while
preserving its quantum information. Remarkably, we achieve these results using
hole spin qubits in germanium, despite the presence of strong spin-orbit
interaction. We accomplish the shuttling of spin basis states over effective
lengths beyond 300 $\mu$m and demonstrate the coherent shuttling of
superposition states over effective lengths corresponding to 9 $\mu$m, which we
can extend to 49 $\mu$m by incorporating dynamical decoupling. These findings
indicate qubit shuttling as an effective approach to route qubits within
registers and to establish quantum links between registers.

<h3>S-wave pairing in a two-orbital t-J model on triangular lattice:  possible application to Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O</h3>

Recently room temperature superconductor was claimed in
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O (also known as LK-99) with $x\in (0.9,1.1)$.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the conduction
electrons are from the doped Cu atoms with valence close to $d^{9}$. Motivated
by this picture, we build a two-orbital Hubbard model on a triangular lattice
formed by the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals with total hole density (summed
over spin and orbital) $n=1-p$. When $p=0$, the system is in a Mott insulator
within this model. When $p>0$, we derive a $t-J$ model and perform a
self-consistent slave boson mean field calculation. Interestingly we find a
s-wave pairing in contrast to the one-orbital t-J model which favors $d+id$
pairing. S wave pairing should be more robust to disorder and may lead to high
Tc superconductor with sufficiently large values of $t$ and $J$. However, the
DFT calculations predict a very small value of $t$ and then the $T_c$ is
expected to be small. If LK99 is really a high Tc superconductor, ingredients
beyond the current model are needed. We conjecture that the doped Cu atoms may
distort the original lattice and form local clusters with smaller Cu -Cu
distance and thus larger values of $t$ and $J$. Within these clusters, we may
locally apply our t-J model calculation and expect high Tc s-wave
superconductor. Then the superconducting islands couple together, which may
eventually become a global superconductor, an insulator or even an anomalous
metal depending on sample details.

Superconductivity often emerges as a dome around a quantum critical point
(QCP) where long-range order is suppressed to zero temperature. So far, this
has been mostly studied in magnetically ordered materials. By contrast, the
interplay between charge order and superconductivity at a QCP is not fully
understood. Here, we present resistance measurements proving that a dome of
superconductivity surrounds the charge-density-wave (CDW) QCP in pristine
samples of 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ tuned with hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, we use
quantum oscillation measurements to show that the superconductivity sets in at
a Lifshitz transition in the electronic band structure. We use density
functional theory to identify the Fermi pockets enabling superconductivity:
large electron and hole pockets connected by the CDW wave vector $\vec{Q}$
which emerge upon partial suppression of the zero-pressure CDW gap. Hence, we
conclude that superconductivity is of interband type enabled by the presence of
hole and electron bands connected by the CDW $\vec{Q}$ vector. Earlier
calculations show that interband interactions are repulsive, which suggests
that unconventional s$_{\pm}$ superconductivity is realised in TiSe$_2$ -
similar to the iron pnictides. These results highlight the importance of
Lifshitz transitions in realising unconventional superconductivity and help
understand its interaction with CDW order in numerous materials.

The lone-pair s states of germanium, tin, and lead underlie many of the
unconventional properties of the inorganic metal halide perovskites. Dynamic
stereochemical expression of the lone pairs is well established for perovskites
based on all three metals, but previously only the germanium perovskites were
thought to express the lone pair crystallographically. In this work, we use
advanced first-principles calculations with a hybrid functional and spin-orbit
coupling to predict stable monoclinic polar phases of $\mathrm{CsSnI}_3$ and
$\mathrm{CsSnBr}_3$, which exhibit a ferroelectric distortion driven by
stereochemical expression of the tin lone pair. We also predict similar
metastable ferroelectric phases of $\mathrm{CsPbI}_3$ and $\mathrm{CsPbBr}_3$.
In addition to ferroelectricity, these phases exhibit the Rashba effect. Spin
splitting in both the conduction and valence bands suggests that nanostructures
based on these phases could host bright ground-state excitons. Finally, we
discuss paths toward experimental realization of these phases via electric
fields and tensile strain.

We have found that surface superstructures made of "monolayer alloys" of Tl
and Pb on Si(111), having giant Rashba effect, produce non-reciprocal
spin-polarized photocurrent via circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) by
obliquely shining circularly polarized near-infrared (IR) light. CPGE is here
caused by injection of in-plane spin into spin-split surface-state bands, which
is observed only on Tl-Pb alloy layers, but not on single-element Tl nor Pb
layers. In the Tl-Pb monolayer alloys, despite their monatomic thickness, the
magnitude of CPGE is comparable to or even larger than the cases of many other
spin-split thin-film materials. The data analysis has provided the relative
permittivity $\epsilon^{\ast}$ of the monolayer alloys to be $\sim$ 1.0, which
is because the monolayer exists at a transition region between the vacuum and
the substrate. The present result opens the possibility that we can optically
manipulate spins of electrons even on monolayer materials.
