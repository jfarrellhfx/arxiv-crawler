<h3>Modern computational studies of the glass transition</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02206v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02206v1</a>

The physics of the glass transition and amorphous materials continues to
attract the attention of a wide research community after decades of effort.
Supercooled liquids and glasses have been studied numerically since the advent
of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations in the last century. Computer
studies have greatly enhanced both experimental discoveries and theoretical
developments and constitute an active and continually expanding research field.
Our goal in this review is to provide a modern perspective on this area. We
describe the need to go beyond canonical methods to attack a problem that is
notoriously difficult in terms of time scales, length scales, and physical
observables. We first summarise recent algorithmic developments to achieve
enhanced sampling and faster equilibration using replica exchange methods,
cluster and swap Monte Carlo algorithms, and other techniques. We then review
some major recent advances afforded by these novel tools regarding the
statistical mechanical description of the liquid-to-glass transition as well as
the mechanical, vibrational and thermal properties of the glassy solid. We
finally describe some important challenges for future research.

<h3>Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory and current fluctuations in active lattice gases</h3>

We study the current large deviations for a lattice model of interacting
active particles displaying a motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To do
this, we first derive the exact fluctuating hydrodynamics of the model in the
large system limit. On top of the usual Gaussian noise terms the theory also
presents Poissonian noise terms, that we fully account for. We find a dynamical
phase transition between flat density profiles and sharply phase-separated
traveling waves, and we derive the associated phase diagram together with the
large deviation function for all phases, including the one displaying MIPS. We
show how the results can be obtained using methods similar to those of
equilibrium phase separation, in spite of the nonequilibrium nature of the
problem.

<h3>Superconducting diode in a field-free superconductor/magnetic-dot nanostructure</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02078v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02078v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
A strong superconducting diode effect (SDE) is revealed in a thin
superconducting film periodically nanostructured with magnetic dots. The SDE is
caused by the current-activated dissipation mitigated by vortex-antivortex
pairs (VAPs), which periodically nucleate under the dots, move and annihilate
in the superconductor - eventually driving the system to the high-resistive
state. Inversing the polarity of the applied current destimulates the
nucleation of VAPs, the system remains superconducting up to far larger
currents, leading to the pronounced diodic response. Our dissipative
Ginzburg-Landau simulations detail the involved processes, and provide reliable
geometric and parametric ranges for the experimental realization of such a
non-volatile superconducting diode, which operates in absence of any applied
magnetic field while being fluxonic by design.
