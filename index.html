<h3>Hydrodynamic equations for a U(N) invariant superfluid</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02613" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02613</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yi-Cai Zhang, Shizhong Zhang</i>
<p>In this paper, we develop the appropriate set of hydrodynamic equations in a
U(N) invariant superfluid that couple the dynamics of superflow and
magnetization. In the special case when both the superfluid and normal
velocities are zero, the hydrodynamic equations reduce to a generalized version
of Landau-Lifshitz equation for ferromagnetism with U(N) symmetry. When both
velocities are non-zero, there appears couplings between the superflow and
magnetization dynamics, and the superfluid velocity no longer satisfies the
irrotational condition. On the other hand, the magnitude of magnetization is no
longer a constant of motion as was the case for the standard Landau-Lifshitz
theory. In comparison with the simple superfluid, the first sound and second
sounds are modified by a non-zero magnetization through various thermodynamic
functions. For U(2) invariant superfluid, we get both (zero-) sound wave and a
spin wave at zero temperature. It is found that the dispersion of spin wave is
always quadratic, which is consistent with detailed microscopic analysis. In
the Appendix, we show that the hydrodynamic equation for a U(N) invariant
superfluid can be obtained from the general hydrodynamic equation with
arbitrary internal symmetries.

<h3>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite  number of universality classes</h3>

</p><i>Shoko Ii, Ko Okumura</i>
<p>The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of
critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent
development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality
class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily
phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly
close analogy with critical phenomena, but this version remarkably reveals the
existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key
for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in
which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air
into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a
universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.

<h3>Thermodynamics of Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with exceptional  points</h3>

</p><i>D. Michel Pino, Yigal Meir, Ramón Aguado</i>
<p>We present an analytical formulation of the thermodynamics, free energy and
entropy, of any generic Bogoliubov de Genes model which develops exceptional
point (EP) bifurcations in its complex spectrum when coupled to reservoirs. We
apply our formalism to a non-Hermitian Josephson junction where, despite recent
claims, the supercurrent does not exhibit any divergences at EPs. The entropy,
on the contrary, shows a universal jump of $1/2\log 2$ which can be linked to
the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at EPs. Our method allows us to
obtain precise analytical boundaries for the temperatures at which such
Majorana entropy steps appear. We propose a generalized Maxwell relation
linking supercurrents and entropy which could pave the way towards the direct
experimental observation of such steps in e.g. quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev
chains.

<h3>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two  dimensions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tyler Ellison, Meng Cheng</i>
<p>The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is
well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated
from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the
environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological
orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying
mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their
(emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and
the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way
connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish
mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no
ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on
topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and
"classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main
examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise.
We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute
the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our
examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on
anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to
a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically
gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by
transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state
topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for
which the braiding relations may be degenerate.

<h3>Altermagnetism imaged and controlled down to the nanoscale</h3>

<p>Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a broad
spectrum of fundamental research and practical device applications. The key
principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal ($\cal{T}$) symmetry, which
in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the
presence of a net-magnetization also imposes severe limitations on
compatibility with other prominent phases ranging from superconductors to
topological insulators, as well as on spintronic device scalability. Recently,
altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to this restriction, since it
shares the enabling $\cal{T}$-symmetry breaking characteristic of
ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing
net-magnetization. To date, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from
spatially averaged probes. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale imaging and control
of altermagnetic ordering ranging from nanoscale vortices to domain walls to
microscale single-domain states in MnTe. We combine the $\cal{T}$-symmetry
breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism with magnetic linear
dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy, to achieve detailed imaging of
the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A rich variety of spin configurations
can be imposed using microstructure patterning or thermal cycling in magnetic
fields. The demonstrated detection and control of altermagnetism paves the way
for future research ranging from ultra-scalable digital and neuromorphic
spintronic devices, to the interplay of altermagnetism with non-dissipative
superconducting or topological phases.

<p>The high ionic conducting sodium superionic conductor Na3Zr2Si2PO12 -NaI
composites have been prepared successfully via solid state reaction route. As
the NaI content increases, the ionic conductivity significantly changes. The
composites with 4% NaI show a maximum ionic conductivity of ~ 3 x 10-4

<h3>Confusion concerning the extrapolated endpoint. When will it ever end?</h3>

<p>In their landmark paper on ``the Brownian motion analog of the well-known
Milne problem in radiative transfer theory'' [\textit{J Stat Phys} 25 (1981)
569--82], Burschka and Titulaer reported: ``The value we find for this `Milne
extrapolation length' is, in the appropriate dimensionless units, approximately
twice the value found in the radiative transfer problem.'' In a study
[\textit{J Stat Phys} 65 (1991) 1217--33] dealing with the absorption by a
black sphere of particles executing a Rayleigh flight (randomly directed
displacements of equal length), the same quantity was found to be about half as
small as the benchmark reslt. The first discrepancy is shown to result from the
disparity of the two length scales; the second, from the zero variance of the
jump lengths. It is stressed that, though all random walk models lead, by
virtue of the central limit theorem, to the diffusion equation, they do not all
lead to the same boundary condition. Some relevent publications from the past
overlooked by Ziff are recalled.

<h3>Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation in Atomistic Machine Learning</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02461" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02461</a>

</p><i>Jin Dai, Santosh Adhikari, Mingjian Wen</i>
<p>Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex
problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences.
Broadly speaking, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt
to learn essential physics and chemistry from a large amount of data.
Consequently, because of the lack of physical or chemical principles in the
functional form, the reliability of the predictions is oftentimes not
guaranteed, particularly for data far out of distribution. It is critical to
quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and understand how the
uncertainty propagates to downstream chemical and materials applications.
Herein, we review and categorize existing uncertainty quantification (UQ)
methods for atomistic ML under a united framework of probabilistic modeling
with the aim of elucidating the similarities and differences between them. We
also discuss performance metrics to evaluate the calibration, precision,
accuracy, and efficiency of the UQ methods and techniques for model
recalibration. In addition, we discuss uncertainty propagation (UP) in widely
used simulation techniques in chemical and materials science, such as molecular
dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We also provide remarks on the challenges
and future opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.

<h3>Markov State Model Approach to Simulate Self-Assembly</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02467</a>
<br>
</p><i>Anthony Trubiano, Michael F. Hagan</i>
<p>Computational modeling of assembly is challenging for many systems because
their timescales vastly exceed those accessible to simulations. This article
describes the MultiMSM, which is a general framework that uses Markov state
models (MSMs) to enable simulating self-assembly and self-organization on
timescales that are orders of magnitude longer than those accessible to brute
force dynamics simulations. In contrast to previous MSM approaches to
simulating assembly, the framework describes simultaneous assembly of many
clusters and the consequent depletion of free subunits or other small
oligomers. The algorithm accounts for changes in transition rates as
concentrations of monomers and intermediates evolve over the course of the
reaction. Using two model systems, we show that the MultiMSM accurately
predicts the concentrations of the full ensemble of intermediates on the long
timescales required for reactions to reach equilibrium. Importantly, after
constructing a MultiMSM for one system concentration, a wide range of other
concentrations can be simulated without any further sampling. This capability
allows for orders of magnitude additional speed up. In addition, the method
enables highly efficient calculation of quantities such as free energy
profiles, nucleation timescales, flux along the ensemble of assembly pathways,
and entropy production rates. Identifying contributions of individual
transitions to entropy production rates reveals sources of kinetic traps. The
method is broadly applicable to systems with equilibrium or nonequilibrium
dynamics, and is trivially parallelizable and thus highly scalable.

<h3>Chemical disorder effects on the Gilbert damping of FeCo alloys</h3>

</p><i>Zhiwei Lu, I. P. Miranda, Simon Streib, Qichen Xu, Rajgowrav Cheenikundil, Manuel Pereiro, Erik Sjöqvist, Olle Eriksson, Anders Bergman, Danny Thonig, Anna Delin</i>
<p>The impact of the local chemical environment on the Gilbert damping in the
binary alloy Fe$_{100-x}$Co$_{x}$ is investigated, using computations based on
density functional theory. By varying the alloy composition x as well as Fe/Co
atom positions we reveal that the effective damping of the alloy is highly
sensitive to the nearest neighbor environment, especially to the amount of Co
and the average distance between Co-Co atoms at nearest neighbor sites. Both
lead to a significant local increase (up to an order of magnitude) of the
effective Gilbert damping, originating mainly from variations of the density of
states at the Fermi energy. In a global perspective (i.e., making a
configuration average for a real material), those differences in damping are
masked by statistical averages. When low-temperature explicit atomistic
dynamics simulations are performed, the impact of short-range disorder on local
dynamics is observed to also alter the overall relaxation rate. Our results
illustrate the possibility of local chemical engineering of the Gilbert
damping, which may stimulate the study of new ways to tune and control
materials aiming for spintronics applications.

<h3>Role of the constriction angle on the clogging by bridging of  suspensions of particles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02505</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nathan Vani, Sacha Escudier, Deok-Hoon Jeong, Alban Sauret</i>
<p>Confined flows of particles can lead to clogging, and therefore failure, of
various fluidic systems across many applications. As a result, design
guidelines need to be developed to ensure that clogging is prevented or at
least delayed. In this Letter, we investigate the influence of the angle of
reduction in the cross-section of the channel on the bridging of semi-dilute
and dense non-Brownian suspensions of spherical particles. We observe a
decrease of the clogging probability with the reduction of the constriction
angle. This effect is more pronounced for dense suspensions close to the
maximum packing fraction where particles are in contact in contrast to
semi-dilute suspensions. We rationalize this difference in terms of arch
selection. We describe the role of the constriction angle and the flow profile,
providing insights into the distinct behavior of semi-dilute and dense
suspensions.

<h3>Helical close-packing of anisotropic tubes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02514" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02514</a>
<br>
</p><i>Benjamin R. Greenvall, Gregory M. Grason</i>
<p>Helically close-packed states of filaments are common in natural and
engineered material systems, ranging from nanoscopic biomolecules to
macroscopic structural components. While the simplest models of helical
close-packing, described by the ideal rope model, neglect anisotropy
perpendicular to the backbone, physical filaments are often quite far from
circular in their cross-section. Here, we consider an anisotropic
generalization of the ideal rope model and show that cross-section anisotropy
has a strongly non-linear impact on the helical close-packing configurations of
helical filaments. We show that the topology and composition of the
close-packing landscape depends on the cross-sectional aspect ratio and is
characterized by several distinct states of self-contact. We characterize the
local density of these distinct states based on the notion of confinement
within a 'virtual' cylindrical capillary, and show that states of optimal
density vary strongly with the degree of anisotropy. While isotropic filaments
are densest in a straight configuration, any measure of anisotropy leads to
helicity of the maximal density state. We show the maximally dense states
exhibit a sequence of transitions in helical geometry and cross-sectional tilt
with increasing anisotropy, from spiral tape to spiral screw packings.
Furthermore, we show that maximal capillary density saturates in a lower bound
for volume fraction of $\pi/4$ in the large-anisotropy, spiral-screw limit.
While cross-sectional anisotropy is well-known to impact the mechanical
properties of filaments, our study shows its strong effects to shape the
configuration space and packing efficiency of this elementary material motif.

<h3>Defect-Assisted Domain Nucleation Drives Unique Exchange Bias Phenomena  in $\bf{MnBi_2Te_4}$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shiqi Yang, Xiaolong Xu, Yuchen Gao, Roger Guzman, Pingfan Gu, Huan Wang, Yuan Huang, Wu Zhou, Tianlong Xia, Yu Ye</i>
<p>The study of the mechanism of exchange bias phenomena and the achievement of
its efficient control are of great importance, as it promotes the revelation of
unique exchange interactions and the development of exotic applications.
However, it is challenging due to the elusive interface between magnetic
phases. In this study, we report an unprecedented exchange bias phenomenon
observed in ultrathin uncompensated antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. The
magnitude and direction of the exchange field can be intentionally controlled
by designing a magnetic field sweep protocol without a field cooling process.
The combined experimental and theoretical simulation results indicate that the
spin-flip process assisted by the ubiquitous defect-induced pinning domain
sites with varying inner exchange interactions might give rise to the emergence
and robustness of this peculiar exchange bias. The temperature and thickness
dependence of the exchange bias phenomena are systematically investigated for
further study and exploitation of its unique properties. This mechanism hold
promise for highly tunable exchange bias in prevalent magnetic systems by
engineering the properties of domain structures, and also offers promising
avenues for the design of spintronic devices combing its topology based on
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.

</p><i>Andrew J. Baish, Benjamin P. Vollmayr-Lee</i>
<p>We consider classical, interacting particles coupled to a thermal reservoir
and subject to a local, time-varying potential while undergoing hops on a
lattice. We impose detailed balance on the hopping rates and map the dynamics
to the Fock space Doi representation, from which we derive the Jarzynski and
Crooks relations. Here the local potential serves to drive the system far from
equilibrium and to provide the work. Next, we utilize the coherent state
representation to map the system to a Doi-Peliti field theory and take the
continuum limit. We demonstrate that time reversal in this field theory takes
the form of a gauge-like transformation which leaves the action invariant up to
a generated work term. The time-reversal symmetry leads to a fundamental
identity, from which we are able to derive the Jarzynski and Crooks relations,
as well as a far-from-equilibrium generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation
relation.

<h3>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from  symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat  state</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</i>
<p>We propose measurement-producing hierarchy emerging among correlated states
by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from
symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and
apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that
generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem
of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces
Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem
composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The
symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT
cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the
efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only
for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical
simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the
symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements
applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.

<h3>High entropy effect on thermoelectric properties of nonequilibrium cubic  phase of AgBiSe2-2xSxTex with x = 0-0.6</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Asato Seshita, Aichi Yamashita, Takayoshi Katase, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi</i>
<p>Silver bismuth diselenide (AgBiSe2) has much attention as an efficient
thermoelectric material due to its low thermal conductivity. However, AgBiSe2
exhibits multiple crystal structural transitions with temperature, and high
thermoelectric performance was realized only in high-temperature cubic phase.
We previously reported the stabilization of cubic phase in AgBiSe2-2xSxTex with
x = 0.6-0.8 at room temperature by high-entropy-alloy (HEA) approach. The cubic
HE-type AgBiSe0.8S0.6Te0.6 achieved a high ZT value of 0.8 at 748 K. In this
paper, we succeeded in stabilizing the cubic phase in AgBiSe2-2xSxTex with x =
0-0.6 by ice-quenching method, and investigated the HE effect on the
thermoelectric properties. Cubic AgBiSe2-2xSxTex exhibited n-type conductivity
from 300 K to 10 K. We found that electronic conductivity was largely increased
around room temperature with increasing the amount of S and Te, although
carrier concentration showed almost the same values. The S and Te substitutions
induced the variation of band structure, resulting in the carrier mobility
enhancement. Furthermore, thermal conducutivity showed reduction tendency with
increasing the amount of S and Te due to enhancement of phonon scattering.
Simultaneous electronic conductivity increase and thermal conductivity
reduction resulted in the systematic improvement of the ZT values for HE-type
cubic AgBiSe2-2xSxTex.

<p>Thermoelectric materials can achieve direct energy conversion between
electricity and heat, thus can be applied to waste heat harvesting and
solid-state cooling. The discovery of new thermoelectric materials is mainly
based on experiments and first-principles calculations. However, these methods
are usually expensive and time-consuming. Recently, the prediction of
properties via machine learning has emerged as a popular method in materials
science. Herein, we firstly did first-principles high-throughput calculations
for a large number of chalcogenides and built a thermoelectric database
containing 796 compounds. Many novel and promising thermoelectric materials
were discovered. Then, we trained four ensemble learning models and two deep
learning models to distinguish the promising thermoelectric materials from the
others for n type and p type doping, respectively. All the presented models
achieve classification accuracy higher than 85% and area under the curve (AUC)
higher than 0.9. Especially, the M3GNet model for n type data achieve accuracy,
precision and recall all higher than 90%. Our works demonstrate a very
efficient way of combining machine learning prediction and first-principles
high-throughput calculations together to accelerate the discovery of advanced
thermoelectric materials.

</p><i>Asif Iqbal Bhatti, David Tingaud, M. Seydou, Sylvain Queyreau</i>
<p>This study delves into bcc HfNbTaTiZr refractory high entropy alloys,
focusing on the $\frac{1}{2}\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocation core
structures. While traditional observations in pure elements often revealed
compact dislocation cores, our investigation reveals variability, including
instances of compact, split, or degenerate cores. Building upon the current
understanding of dislocation behavior, we propose that this observed
variability may be intricately linked to the presence of chemical short-range
order within the alloy. The unique composition of HfNbTaTiZr, between bcc and
hcp elements, introduces a dynamic interplay influencing the dislocation core
structure. In light of these findings, we discuss the implications for
plasticity mechanisms in high entropy alloys. The presence of varied
dislocation core structures suggests a complex interplay between local phases
and short-range ordering, influencing the material's response to external
stresses. This challenges the conventional understanding of
dislocation-mediated plasticity and opens avenues for tailoring the mechanical
properties of refractory alloys through the controlled manipulation of
short-range order.

<p>We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the
existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological
crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation
symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the
system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline
symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of
higher- order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus
generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by
concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence
of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline
insulators to include latent symmetries.

frequency breaks the symmetry of the states. The effect can be extremely strong
due to the interplay between the force and the quantum fluctuations resulting
from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal bath. The force changes the
rates of the fluctuation-induced walk over the quantum states of the
oscillator. If the number of the states is large, the effect accumulates to an
exponentially large factor in the rate of switching between the vibrational
states. We find the factor and analyze it in the limiting cases. We show that
in the zero-temperature limit the extra force breaks the detailed balance,
leading to a nonperturbatively strong increase of the switching rate.

<p>While the currents of the defocusing Ablowitz-Ladik chain are unambiguously
defined, no explicit formulas for their densities have been obtained yet. We
close this gap. As a consequence, we also complete the argument which

<h3>Chain-length-dependent correlated molecular motion in polymers</h3>

</p><i>Matthew Reynolds, Daniel L. Baker, Peter D. Olmsted, Johan Mattsson</i>
<p>We show how dynamic heterogeneities (DH), a hallmark of glass-forming
materials, depend on chain flexibility and chain length in polymers. For highly
flexible polymers, a relatively large number of monomers ($N_c\sim500$) undergo
correlated motion at the glass transition temperature $T_g$, independent of
molecular weight ($M$). In contrast, less flexible polymers show a complex
$N_c(M)$ behaviour divided into three regimes, consistent with observation in
both $T_g(M)$ and chain conformational structure. For short oligomers
($\lesssim$ 2 Kuhn steps), a transition from mainly $\it{inter}$molecular
correlations and $N_c\sim 200$, to strongly $\it{intra}$molecular correlations
and $N_c< 50$ (roughly the molecular size) is observed; for longer chains,
$N_c$ increases weakly, before saturating. For poly(methyl methacrylate), a
remarkable similarity is found between $N_c(M)$ and the $M$-dependent ratio of
the activation barriers of the structural ($\alpha$) and secondary ($\beta$)
relaxations. Our results suggest a link between the DH length-scale and the
number of $\beta$ relaxation events jointly-activated to facilitate the
$\alpha$ relaxation.

<p>Nonvolatile optical manipulation of material properties on demand is a highly
sought-after feature in the advancement of future optoelectronic applications.
While the discovery of such metastable transition in various materials holds
good promise for achieving this goal, their practical implementation is still
in the nascent stage. Here, we unravel the nature of the ultrafast
laser-induced hidden state in 1T-TaS2 by systematically characterizing the
electronic structure evolution throughout the reversible transition cycle. We
identify it as a mixed-stacking state involving two similarly low-energy
interlayer orders, which is manifested as the charge density wave phase
disruption. Furthermore, our comparative experiments utilizing the single-pulse
writing, pulse-train erasing and pulse-pair control explicitly reveal the
distinct mechanism of the bidirectional transformations -- the ultrafast
formation of the hidden state is initiated by a coherent phonon which triggers
a competition of interlayer stacking orders, while its recovery to the initial
state is governed by the progressive domain coarsening. Our work highlights the
deterministic role of the competing interlayer orders in the nonvolatile phase
transition in the layered material 1T-TaS2, and promises the coherent control
of the phase transition and switching speed. More importantly, these results
establish all-optical engineering of stacking orders in low-dimensional
materials as a viable strategy for achieving desirable nonvolatile electronic
devices.

</p><i>Ke Li, Hong-Fang Song, Yu-Liang Sun, Hao-Jie Xu, Fuqiang Wang</i>
<p>Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy
proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions,
shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong
interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold
$^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a
function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external
magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at
small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A
universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed
between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in
physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in
nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly
interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.

<p>Quasi-static hysteresis loops of spherical and spheroidal magnetite
nanoparticles with semi-axes ratio a/b = 1.5 and 2.0 with different types of
combined magnetic anisotropy are calculated using numerical simulation. For
particles of each type the critical diameters Dcr are determined so, that above
Dcr the magnetization curling becomes the easiest mode of particle
magnetization reversal. Hysteresis loops are calculated both for single-domain
nanoparticles in the diameter range Dcr < D < Dc, and for vortex particles with
diameters D > Dc, where Dc is the single-domain diameter. The results obtained
are compared with the usual hysteresis loops of particles with diameters D <
Dcr. Hysteresis loops of dilute oriented assemblies are studied for various
angles of the external magnetic field relative to the particle symmetry axis.
For the corresponding randomly oriented assemblies the hysteresis loops are
obtained by averaging over this angle. It is shown that the magnetization
reversal of nanoparticles studied occurs through the nucleation of the curling
mode, which can be accompanied by the formation of various vortices in finite
intervals of the external magnetic field. The remanent magnetization and
coercive force of oriented and non-oriented dilute assemblies of magnetite
nanoparticles with different aspect ratios are determined as the functions of
the transverse particle diameter.

<h3>Crystal rotation during alloy heating</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Zhida Liang, Emad Maawad, Florian Pyczak</i>
<p>Over past decades, high energy X-ray diffraction techniques at synchrotron
beamline offer us the unique possibility to follow concomitantly some
mechanisms on the grain level in metallic materials. Crystal rotation, as one
important factor for the crystal orientation distribution, usually influences
the anisotropic properties of materials. Crystal rotation has been visualized
in deformation, recrystallization, and chemical reaction processes. In this
study, we firstly visualized an unexpected crystal rotation during heating up
of superalloys as well by in situ 3DXRD scanning microscopy which has not been
previously reported yet. The crystal rotation was found to be related to the
locked-in first order residual strain relief during the annealing treatment. In
addition, intermittent dynamic, i.e., some individual diffraction spots from
Debye-Scherrer rings appearing, disappearing, and reappearing, occurred in this
study which has ever been thought to be caused by subgrain formation in
deformation experiments. However, by residual strain analysis coupled with
finite element simulation, we found that the intermittent dynamic is married
with thermal expansion, crystal distortion, and crystal rotation as well. This
finding opens a new world for deeply understanding the residual strain relief
during materials, particularly metal, heating.

<h3>The Griffiths phase and beyond: A large deviations study of the magnetic  susceptibility of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model</h3>

</p><i>Lambert Münster, Alexander K. Hartmann, Martin Weigel</i>
<p>The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the
ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the
actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large
fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare,
long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in
response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional
bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is
expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo
algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is
extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of
the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility
distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through
the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the
zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory
as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting
differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the
fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the
magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.

<h3>Vacancies making jerky flow in complex alloys</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Li Wang, Zihan You, Fanqi Zhong, Alan Cocks, Florian Pyczak</i>
<p>Longevity of materials, especially alloys, is crucial for enhancing the
sustainability and efficiency of various applications, including gas turbines.
Jerky flow, also known as dynamic strain aging effect, can indeed have a
significant impact on the fatigue life of high-temperature components in gas
turbines. In general, three jerky flow types, i.e., A, B and C, existed in
superalloys. Type A and B, occurring at low temperature, were proved to be
caused by interstitial elements, such as carbon. However, Type C serration at
high temperature has not been verified directly and remains unresolved, which
was unanimously agreed it is caused by the interaction between solute elements
and dislocations. In this study, our new discovery challenged this mainstream
axiom. We proposed that vacancies play a dominant role in inducing jerky flow
instead of solute atoms. By transmission electron microscopy, we observed
directly that dislocations are pinned by vacancy-type dislocation loops (PDLs)
or dipoles. Our findings suggest that vacancies located at dislocation jogs are
primarily responsible for pinning and unpinning of superlattice dislocations.
As dislocations move and interact with vacancies, PDLs or dipoles are left
behind in their path. This pinning and unpinning process is repeated as
successive dislocations encounter the newly formed PDLs or dipoles, leading to
the recurring fluctuations in the stress, i.e., serrated flow. Additionally,
antisite defects created by Co, Cr and Ti sitting on Ni positions is postulated
to facilitate vacancy formation and migration towards dislocations via nearest
neighbor jumps. This study provides a new avenue to show how future alloy
design can improve the fatigue life of superalloys in extreme environments.

<h3>On the spontaneous magnetization of two-dimensional ferromagnets</h3>

<br>
</p><i>D. Pescia, A. Vindigni</i>
<p>Ferromagnetism is typically discussed in terms of the exchange interaction
and magnetic anisotropies. Yet real samples are inevitably affected by the
magnetostatic dipole-dipole interaction. Because of this interaction, a theorem
(R.B. Griffiths, Free Energy of interacting magnetic dipoles, Phys. Rev. 176,
655 (1968)) forbids a spontaneous magnetization in, nota bene,
three-dimensional bodies. Here we discuss perpendicularly and in-plane
magnetized ferromagnetic bodies in the shape of a slab of finite thickness. In
perpendicularly magnetized slabs, magnetic domains are energetically favored
when the lateral size is sufficiently large, i.e. there is no spontaneous
magnetization. For in-plane magnetization, instead, spontaneous magnetization
is possible below a critical thickness which, in real thin films, could be as
small as few monolayers. At this critical thickness, we predict a genuine phase
transition to a multi-domain state. These results have implications for
two-dimensional ferromagnetism.

<h3>Nanostructured BiVO4 Photoanodes Fabricated by Vanadium-infused  Interaction for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</h3>

<p>Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as a highly prospective material for
photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, current
limitations with this material lie in the difficulties in producing stable and
continuous BiVO4 layers with efficient carrier transfer kinetics, thereby
impeding its widespread application in water splitting processes. This study
introduces a new fabrication approach that yields continuous, monoclinic
nanostructured BiVO4 films, paving the way for their use as photoanodes in
efficient PEC water oxidation for hydrogen production under solar light
conditions. The fabrication involves the intercalation of vanadium (V) ions
into Bi2O3 films at 450oC. Upon interaction with V ions, the film undergoes a
transformation from tetragonal Bi2O3 to monoclinic scheelite BiVO4. This
synthesis method enables the fabrication of single monoclinic phase BiVO4 films
with thicknesses up to 270 nm. The engineered monoclinic BiVO4 film, devoid of
any pinholes that could cause carrier loss, exhibits a robust photocurrent of
1.0 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE in a neutral electrolyte, without requiring additional
modifications or doping. Moreover, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a
cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) co-catalyst into the BiVO4 photoanode significantly
enhances the lifetime of photogenerated holes by a factor of nine, resulting in
a further elevation of the photocurrent to 2.9 mA/cm2. This remarkable PEC
enhancement can be attributed to the surface state passivation by the Co-Pi
co-catalyst. Our fabrication approach opens up a new facile route for producing
large-scale, highly efficient BiVO4 photoanodes for PEC water splitting
technology.

<h3>Renormalized and iterative formalism of the Andreev levels within large  multi-parametric space</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Xian-Peng Zhang</i>
<p>We attain a renormalized and iterative expression of the Andreev level in a
quantum-dot Josephson junction, which is bound to have significant implications
due to several significant advantages. The renormalized form of the Andreev
level not only allows us to extend beyond the limitations of small tunnel
coupling, quantum dot energy, magnetic field, and mean-field Coulomb
interaction but also enables the capturing of subgap levels that leak out of
the superconducting gap into the continuous spectrum. Furthermore, the
iterative form of the Andreev level provides an intuitive understanding of the
spin-split and superconducting proximity effects of the superconducting leads.
We find a singlet-doublet quantum phase transition (QPT) in the ground state
due to the intricate competition between the superconducting and spin-split
proximity effects, that differs from the typical QPT arising from the
competition between the superconducting proximity effect (favoring singlet
phase) and the quantum dot Coulomb interaction (favoring doublet phase). This
QPT has a diverse phase diagram owing to the spin-split proximity effects which
favors the doublet phase akin to the quantum-dot Coulomb interaction but can be
also enhanced by the tunneling coupling like the superconducting proximity
effect. Unlike the typical QPT, where tunnel coupling prefers singlet ground
state, this novel QPT enables strong tunnel coupling to suppress the singlet
ground state via the spin-split proximity effect, allowing a
singlet-doublet-singlet transition with increasing tunnel coupling. Our
renormalized and iterative formalism of the Andreev level is crucial for the
electrostatic gate, external flux, and magnetic field modulations of the
Andreev qubits.

</p><i>Mohit Chaudhary, Hans-Christian Weissker</i>
<p>The localized surface-plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of coinage-metal clusters
and nanoparticles provide the basis for a great number of applications, the
conception and necessary optimization of which require precise theoretical
description and understanding. However, for the size range from clusters of a
few atoms through nanoparticles of a few nanometers, where quantum effects and
atomistic structure play a significant role, none of the methods employed to
date has been able to provide high-quality spectra for all sizes. The main
problem is the description of the filled shells of d electrons which influence
the optical response decisively. In the present work we show that the DFT+U
method, employed with real-time time-dependent density-functional theory
calculations (RT-TDDFT), provides spectra in good agreement with experiment for
silver clusters ranging from 4 to 923 atoms, the latter representing a
nanoparticle with a diameter of 3 nm. Both the electron-hole-type discrete
spectra of the smallest clusters and the broad plasmon resonances of the larger
sizes are obtained. All calculations have been carried out using the same value
of the effective U parameter that has been found to provide good results in
bulk silver. The agreement with experiment for all sizes shows that the U
parameter is surprisingly transferable. Our results open the pathway for TDDFT
calculations of many practically relevant systems including clusters coupled to
bio-molecules or to other nano-objects.

<p>Proton-transfer type molecular ferroelectrics hold great application
potential due to their large spontaneous polarizations, high Curie
temperatures, and small switching fields. However, it is puzzling that
preparation of quasi-2D films with macroscopic ferroelectric behaviors has only
been reported in few molecular ferroelectrics. To resolve this puzzle, we
studied the effect of microstructures on macroscopic ferroelectric properties
of 5,6-Dichloro-2-methylbenzimidazole (DC-MBI) films grown using
low-temperature deposition followed by restrained crystallization (LDRC)
method. We revealed a competition between dense spherulites and porous
microstructures containing randomly oriented nanograins in as-grown films.
Post-growth annealing at moderate temperature promotes the formation of
spherulites which leads to macroscopic ferroelectric polarization switching.
These results highlight microstructure density as a critical factor for
macroscopic ferroelectric properties, potentially resolving the puzzle for
absence of macroscopic ferroelectric behavior in molecules ferroelectric films.
We expect the approach for enhancing microstructure density offered in this
work to greatly advance fabrication of quasi-2D molecular ferroelectrics films
and to unlock their potential in device applications.

</p><i>Homa Ghaiedi, Luis Carlos Pinzon Herrera, Saja Alshafeay, Leonard Harris, Jorge Almodovar, Karthik Nayani</i>
<p>Collagen is a key component of the extracellular matrix and well-oriented
domains of collagen are relevant for mimicking the local cell environment in
vitro. While there has been significant attention directed towards the
alignment of collagen, formation of large-scale oriented domains remains a key
challenge. Type I collagen self-assembles to form liquid crystalline (LC)
mesophases in acidic conditions at concentrations above 100 mg/ml. The LC
mesophase provides an efficient platform for large-scale alignment and
patterning of collagen coated substrates. However, there exist challenges
related to solubilizing and processing of collagen at such high concentrations
in order to replicate the native extra cellular matrix (ECM). In this
contribution, we report on centimeter-scale alignment in collagen-coated glass
substrates using solutions that are well below the LC-forming concentrations.
Importantly, we are also able to extend this method to create a mimic of the
native ECM via macroscopic 3-D collagen hydrogels with programmed anisotropy
within them. We explain the formation of these uniform domains via
shear-induced and magnetically-induced liquid crystallinity of the collagen
solutions. We show that the orientation, spreading and aspect ratio of Human
Schwann Cells (HSCs) all are strongly coupled with the alignment of the
collagen substrate/hydrogel. We use a simple Metroplis-based model to reveal
that a critical magnetic field strength exists for a given concentration of
collagen, exceeding which, macroscopic alignment is permissible- enabling
guidance for future studies on alignment of collagen at high concentrations.

</p><i>Maximilian Black, Mehdi Asadi, Parsa Darman, Finja Schillmöller, Sara Darbari, Nahid Talebi</i>
<p>Lead halide perovskites have emerged as platforms for exciton-polaritonic
studies at room temperature thanks to their excellent photoluminescence
efficiency and synthetic versatility. In this work we find proof of strong
exciton-photon coupling in cavities formed by the layered crystals themselves,
a phenomenon known as self-hybridization effect. We use multi-layers of high
quality Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites in their 2D crystalline form, benefitting
from their quantum-well excitonic resonances and the strong Fabry-Perot cavity
modes resulting from the total-internal-reflection at their smooth surfaces.
Optical spectroscopy reveals bending of the cavity modes typical for
exciton-polariton formation, and photoluminescence spectroscopy shows thickness
dependent splitting of the excitonic resonance. Strikingly, local optical
excitation with energy below the excitonic resonance of the flakes in
photoluminescence measurements unveils coupling of light to in-plane
polaritonic modes with directed propagation. These exciton-polaritons exhibit
high coupling efficiencies and extremely low loss propagation mechanisms which
is confirmed by finite difference time domain simulations. We therefore prove
that mesoscopic 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites flakes represent an effective
but simple system to study the rich physics of exciton-polaritons at room
temperature.

<h3>Raman signatures of the strong intra- and inter-molecular charge  oscillations in bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene (BEDT-TTF)  \k{appa}-phase salts</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Alberto Girlando</i>
<p>First principle calculations of the Raman intensities of a (BEDT-TTF)^+_2
centrosymmetric dimer lead to a full reconsideration of the assignment of the
three C=C stretching phonons in \k{appa}-phase BEDT-TTF salts. In contrast with
previous interpretation, it is found that the presence of the out-of-phase
coupling of the antisymmetric external C=C stretching mode has also to be taken
into account. This mode, infrared-active for a single BEDT-TTF molecule,
implies a strong intra-molecular charge oscillation along BEDT-TTF long
molecular axis. In the consequent reassignment of the C=C spectral region, a
very broad band appearing in the cross polarized Raman spectra is interpreted
as due to inter -dimer electron-molecular vibration (e-mv) coupling, to be
contrasted with the well known intra-dimer e-mv coupling that induces very
strong infrared absorptions. Analysis of the data in term of a properly
developed e-mv scheme yields an evaluation of the Hubbard parameters relevant
to the so-called effective dimer model often used to interpret the physical
properties of \k{appa}-BEDT-TTF salts. Finally the Raman spectra of an
asymmetric (BEDT-TTF)^{+0.6} (BEDT-TTF)^{+0.4} dimer have been calculated in
order to interpret the Raman spectra of the intriguing charge-ordered (CO),
ferroelectric phase of \k{appa}-(BEDT-TTF)_2 Hg(SCN)_2 Cl. It turns out that in
the asymmetric dimer the strong intra-dimer the e-mv induced infrared C=C
stretching absorption should appear with huge intensity also in Raman. The
absence of such band in the spectra of \k{appa}-(BEDT-TTF)_2 Hg(SCN)_2 Cl
ferroelectric phase gives clear alternative indications about the possible CO
pattern in such a phase.

</p><i>Asmaul Smitha Rashid, Le Yi, Nitin Samarth, Régis Mélin, Morteza Kayyalha</i>
<p>We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene
three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of
resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion
regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point
beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with
maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this
transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a
model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the
nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion
to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic
phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid
components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used
to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the
$\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These
nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting
$\pi$ qubits.

<p>We have used a combination of linear response time-domain THz spectroscopy
(TDTS) and high-field non-linear THz spectroscopy to separately probe the
electronic momentum and energy relaxation rates respectively of the Dirac
semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$. We find, consistent with prior measurements, that
Cd$_3$As$_2$ has an enormous nonlinearities in the THz frequency range. We
extract the momentum relaxation rate of Cd$_3$As$_2$ using Drude fits to the
optical conductivity. We also conduct THz range 2D coherent spectroscopy. The
dominant response is a pump-probe signal, which allow us to separately extract
the energy relaxation rate. We find that the rate of energy relaxation
decreases down to the lowest measured temperatures. We connect this to
Cd$_3$As$_2$ anomalous lattice dynamics, evidence for which is found in its low
thermal conductivity and soft phonons in Raman scattering. The lack of a peak
in the energy relaxation rate as a function of T can be connected to the linear
in T dependence of the current relaxation e.g. the phonon scattering is elastic
down to the lowest measured temperatures approximately 120 K.

<h3>The influence of dark excitons on the electroabsorption spectrum of  polyacetylene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jaspal Singh Bola, Ryan M. Stolley, Prashanna Poudel, Joel S. Miller, Christoph Boheme, Z. Valy Vardeny</i>
<p>This study revisits the electroabsorption (EA) spectrum of polyacetylene, as
functions of the electric field strength, isomerization degree, and light
polarization states. The EA spectrum of $cis$-$(CH)_x$ reveals an oscillatory
feature that follows the Stark shift-related first derivative of the materials
absorption spectrum that contains v(0-1) and v(0-2) sidebands of the excited
$C=C$ stretching vibration that agrees well with the Raman spectrum. EA
spectrum of $trans $-$(CH)_x$ does not match the first derivative of the
materials absorption spectrum, and the phonon sideband frequency does not agree
with the RS spectrum. EA spectrum of $trans $-$(CH)_x$ reveals a band below the
first allowed $1B_u$ exciton. We interpret this feature as due to the electric
field activated even-parity dark (forbidden) exciton, namely $mA_g$ ($m >1$),
showing that the nonluminescent $trans $-$(CH)_x$ is due to the reverse order
of the excited states, where a dark $mA_g$ exciton lies below the allowed
$1B_u$ exciton. This agrees with the unusual phonon sideband in $trans
$-$(CH)_x$ absorption, since the excited state attenuation caused by the fast
internal conversion from $1B_u$ to $mA_g$ influences the apparent frequency
that determines the phonon sideband. Consequently, from the EA and RS spectra
we estimate the $1B_u$ lifetime in $trans $-$(CH)_x$ to be $\sim 30$ fs.
Integrated EA spectrum of $trans $-$(CH)_x$ shows a traditional Huang-Rhys type
series with a relaxation parameter, $S \sim 0.5$. This indicates that the EA
spectrum of the $trans $ isomer is also determined by a Stark shift related to
the first derivative of the absorption spectrum, but preferentially for the
longest chains in the films chain lengths distribution. This is due to the
$N^3$ response of the non-linear susceptibility, $\chi^{(3)}$ ($\sim$EA),
dependence on the chain length having $N$ monomers.

<p>We demonstrate and verify the in-situ addition of a collecting lens for
electroluminescence experiments to an existing scanning tunneling microscope.
We fabricate a simple clip-on lens that we reversibly attach at the sample
plate via regular sample transfer tools to collimate the light emitted from a
plasmonic tunneling junction to the viewport ordinarily used for optical
access. The proximity of the lens to the tunneling junction allows us to
exploit the full numerical aperture which helps us achieve good collection
efficiencies, demonstrating the quick turnaround of converting an existing
setup with optical access into a practical scanning luminescence microscope. We
verify the function of the clip-on lens by measuring the bias dependent plasmon
of Au, Ag, and spatial luminescence maps.

<h3>Coherent Transfer of Lattice Entropy via Extreme Nonlinear Phononics in  Metal Halide Perovskites</h3>

</p><i>Z. Liu, Y. Shi, T. Jiang, L. Luo, C. Huang, M. Mootz, Z. Song, Y. Yan, Y. Yao, J. Zhao, J. Wang</i>
<p>Entropy transfer in metal halide perovskites, characterized by significant
lattice anharmonicity and low stiffness, underlies the remarkable properties
observed in their optoelectronic applications, ranging from solar cells to
lasers. The conventional view of this transfer involves stochastic processes
occurring within a thermal bath of phonons, where lattice arrangement and
energy flow from higher to lower frequency modes. Here we unveil a
comprehensive chronological sequence detailing a conceptually distinct,
coherent transfer of entropy in a prototypical perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$Pbl$_3$.
The terahertz periodic modulation imposes vibrational coherence into electronic
states, leading to the emergence of mixed (vibronic) quantum beat between
approximately 3 THz and 0.3 THz. We highlight a well-structured, bi-directional
time-frequency transfer of these diverse phonon modes, each developing at
different times and transitioning from high to low frequencies from 3 to 0.3
THz, before reversing direction and ascending to around 0.8 THz.
First-principles molecular dynamics simulations disentangle a complex web of
coherent phononic coupling pathways and identify the salient roles of the
initial modes in shaping entropy evolution at later stages. Capitalizing on
coherent entropy transfer and dynamic anharmonicity presents a compelling
opportunity to exceed the fundamental thermodynamic (Shockley-Queisser) limit
of photoconversion efficiency and to pioneer novel optoelectronic
functionalities.

<h3>Sokoban percolation on the Bethe lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03072</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ofek Lauber Bonomo, Itamar Shitrit, Shlomi Reuveni</i>
<p>`With persistence, a drop of water hollows out the stone' goes the ancient
Greek proverb. Yet, canonical percolation models do not account for
interactions between a moving tracer and its environment. Recently, we have
introduced the Sokoban model, which differs from this convention by allowing a
tracer to push single obstacles that block its path. To test how this newfound
ability affects percolation, we hereby consider a Bethe lattice on which
obstacles are scattered randomly and ask for the probability that the Sokoban
percolates through this lattice, i.e., escapes to infinity. We present an exact
solution to this problem and determine the escape probability as a function of
obstacle density. Similar to regular percolation, we show that the escape
probability undergoes a second-order phase transition. We exactly determine the
critical obstacle density at which this transition occurs and show that it is
higher than that of a tracer without obstacle-pushing abilities. Our findings
assert that pushing facilitates percolation on the Bethe lattice, as
intuitively expected. This result, however, sharply contrasts with our previous
findings on the 2D square lattice. There, the Sokoban cannot escape
$\unicode{x2013}$ not even at densities well below the percolation threshold.
We discuss the reasons behind this striking difference, which calls for a
deeper and better understanding of percolation in the presence of tracer-media
interactions.

<h3>Bayesian optimization for stable properties amid processing fluctuations  in sputter deposition</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ankit Shrivastava, Matias Kalaswad, Joyce O. Custer, David P. Adams, Habib N. Najm</i>
<p>We introduce a Bayesian optimization approach to guide the sputter deposition
of molybdenum thin films, aiming to achieve desired residual stress and sheet
resistance while minimizing susceptibility to stochastic fluctuations during
deposition. Thin films are pivotal in numerous technologies, including
semiconductors and optical devices, where their properties are critical.
Sputter deposition parameters, such as deposition power, vacuum chamber
pressure, and working distance, influence physical properties like residual
stress and resistance. Excessive stress and high resistance can impair device
performance, necessitating the selection of optimal process parameters.
Furthermore, these parameters should ensure the consistency and reliability of
thin film properties, assisting in the reproducibility of the devices. However,
exploring the multidimensional design space for process optimization is
expensive. Bayesian optimization is ideal for optimizing inputs/parameters of
general black-box functions without reliance on gradient information. We
utilize Bayesian optimization to optimize deposition power and pressure using a
custom-built objective function incorporating observed stress and resistance
data. Additionally, we integrate prior knowledge of stress variation with
pressure into the objective function to prioritize films least affected by
stochastic variations. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization
effectively explores the design space and identifies optimal parameter
combinations meeting desired stress and resistance specifications.

<p>We report an experimental study of quantum point contacts defined in a
high-quality strained germanium quantum well with layered electric gates. At
zero magnetic field, we observe quantized conductance plateaus in units of
2$e^2/h$. Bias-spectroscopy measurements reveal that the energy spacing between
successive one-dimensional subbands ranges from 1.5 to 5\,meV as a consequence
of the small effective mass of the holes and the narrow gate constrictions. At
finite magnetic fields perpendicular to the device plane, the edges of the
conductance plateaus get splitted due to the Zeeman effect and Land\'{e} $g$
factors are estimated to be $\sim6.6$ for the holes in the germanium quantum
well. We demonstrate that all quantum point contacts in the same device have
comparable performances, indicating a reliable and reproducible device
fabrication process. Thus, our work lays a foundation for investigating
multiple forefronts of physics in germanium-based quantum devices that require
quantum point contacts as a building block.

<h3>Calculated Unconventional Superconductivity via Charge Fluctuations in  Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yuan Tian, Sergey Y. Savrasov</i>
<p>Electrons on Kagome lattice exhibit a wealth of features including Dirac
points, van Hove singularities and flatbands. When the Fermi level is placed at
the van Hove saddle point, the Fermi surface is perfectly nested and a rich
variety of electronic instabilities is known to occur. The material realization
of such scenario is a recently discovered Kagome system CsV3Sb5 whose
superconductivity near charge-density wave instability at low temperatures
points to an unconventional, non-electron-phonon, pairing mechanism. Here we
use a recently developed combination of density functional theory with momentum
and frequency-resolved self-energies deduced from the so-called
fluctuational-exchange-type random phase approximation to study charge
fluctuation mediated pairing tendencies in CsV3Sb5. Based on our numerical
diagonalization of the BCS gap equation, two competing solutions emerge from
these calculations with A_{1g} (anisotropic s-wave-like) and B_{2g}
(d_{x2-y2},d_{xy}-like) symmetries of the superconducting order parameter. Our
evaluated Eliashberg spectral functions {\alpha}2F({\omega}) are purely due to
electronic correlations; they were found to be strongly peaked in the vicinity
of frequency 7 meV that sets the scale of charge fluctuations. The
superconducting coupling constants for the leading pairing channels are
estimated as a function of the nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction V, a
well-known prime parameter of the extended Hubbard model. They were found in
the range of 0.2-0.4 depending on V. We evaluate the superconducting T_{c}
close to the values that are observed experimentally that point to the charge
fluctuations to provide a substantial contribution to the pairing mechanism in
CsV3Sb5.

<p>We provide an overview of experiments exploring resonances in the collision
of ultracold clouds of atoms. Using a laser-based accelerator that capitalizes
on the energy resolution provided by the ultracold atomic setting, we unveil
resonance phenomena such as Feshbach and shape resonances in their
quintessential form by literally photographing the halo of outgoing scattered
atoms. We exploit the tunability of magnetic Feshbach resonances to instigate
an interplay between scattering resonances. By experimentally recording the
scattering in a parameter space spanned by collision energy and magnetic field,
we capture the imprint of the $S$-matrix pole flow in the complex energy plane.
After revisiting experiments that place a Feshbach resonance in the proximity
of a shape resonance and an anti-bound state, respectively, we discuss the
possibility of using $S$-matrix pole interplay between two Feshbach resonances
to create a bound-state-in-the-continuum.

</p><i>Fei Yen, Lei Meng, Tian Gao, Sixia Hu</i>
<p>The different types of magnetism arise mainly from how electrons move and
interact with each other. In this work, we show how protons (H$^+$) also
exhibit magnetic behavior. We measured the magnetic susceptibility of the
ammonium halides and identified pronounced increases at 232 K, 233 K and 243 K
for NH$_4$I, NH$_4$Br and NH$_4$Cl, respectively, which all coincide to the
geometric ordering of its ammonium cations. With extensive literature
establishing the fact that the ammonium cations exhibit rotational motion even
towards the lowest temperatures, we take into account that the orbital motion
of the protons carries a magnetic moment and find it to be larger than that of
the paired electrons. Consequently, the structural phase transitions are
magnetically-driven as the system attempts to lift 8-fold energy degeneracies
of the proton orbitals via Jahn-Teller distortions. Our findings identify that
NH$_4$$^+$ cations are capable of comprising magnetism which appears to be
ubiquitous in ammonia-based molecular solids.

<p>Crystal Orbital Overlap Population (COOP) is one of the effective tools for

from a first principles all-electron calculation with numeric atom-centered
orbitals. The chemical-bonding analysis using the developed code was
demonstrated for F2 and Si. Furthermore, we applied the method to analyze the
chemical-bonding changes associated with a Li intercalation in three
representative layered materials: graphite, MoS2, and ZrNCl, because of their
great industrial importance, particularly for the applications in battery and
superconducting materials. The COOP analysis provided some insights for
understanding the intercalation mechanism and the stability of the intercalated

<p>We unveil the existence of two-particle bound state in the continuum (BIC) in
a one-dimensional interacting nonreciprocal lattice with a generalized boundary
condition. By applying the Bethe-ansatz method, we can exactly solve the
wavefunction and eigenvalue of the bound state in the continuum band, which
enable us to precisely determine the phase diagrams of BIC. Our results
demonstrate that the non-reciprocal hopping can delocalize the bound state and
thus shrink the region of BIC. By analyzing the wavefunction, we identify the
existence of two types of BICs with different spatial distributions and
analytically derive the corresponding threshold values for the breakdown of
BICs. The BIC with similar properties is also found to exist in another system
with an impurity potential.

<h3>Magnetoelectric Coupling Based on Protons in Ammonium Sulfate</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03171" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03171</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lei Meng, Chen He, Fei Yen</i>
<p>Most ferroelectric crystals have their own set of unique characteristics and
ammonium sulfate (NH$_4$)$_2$SO$_4$ is no exception. We report on two
previously unidentified features in ammonium sulfate: 1) that there are at
least two successive transitions instead of one occurring at the Curie
temperature $T$$_C$ = 223 K according to dielectric constant measurements; and
2) pronounced step-like anomalies are found in the magnetic susceptibility
exactly at $T$$_C$. To explain these results, we take into account that there
exists a previously unidentified linear coupling between the magnetic and
electric dipole moments of the NH$_4$$^+$ tetrahedra due to their rapid
reorientations and distorted geometry, respectively. The magnetic moments are
small, 0.0016 $\mu$$_B$ for every $C$$_3$ reorientation which involve three
protons (H$^+$) undergoing orbital motion. Nevertheless, short-range
correlations exist in the paraelectric phase because the magnetic moments are
restricted to only point along 14 possible orientations due to the symmetry and
periodic nature of the potential wells. At $T$$_C$, $C$$_2$ reorientations
(involving four protons) are no longer energetically feasible so the reduction
in the degrees of freedom to 8 further enhances the effect of the magnetic
interactions. This triggers long-range ordering of the orbital moments in an
antiferromagnetic configuration along the $ab$-plane, which via
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, end up canting slightly toward the $c$-axis
direction. Since there exists two types of inequivalent NH$_4$$^+$ groups that
reorient at different frequencies with temperature and do not have the same
degree of distortion, the emerging polar phase is ferrielectric.

<p>We use molecular dynamics simulations to study coarsening dynamics in achiral
banana-shaped bent-core liquid crystals following a quench from the high
concentration polar smectic (SmX) phase to lower concentrations that favor the
exotic twist-bend (TB) phase. Our novel result is the identification of an
intermediate splay-bend state emerging prior to the eventual TB phase. The
latter coarsens via the annihilation of {\it beta lines} which are analogous to
string defects in nematic liquid crystals. Our findings are relevant for a
large class of chiral systems assembled from achiral entities.

<p>Materials potentially hosting Kitaev spin-liquid states are considered
crucial for realizing topological quantum computing. However, the intricate
nature of spin interactions within these materials complicates the precise
measurement of low-energy spin excitations indicative of fractionalized
excitations. Using Na$_{2}$Co$_2$TeO$_{6}$ as an example, we study these
low-energy spin excitations using the time-resolved resonant elastic x-ray
scattering (tr-REXS). Our observations unveil remarkably slow spin dynamics at
the magnetic peak, whose recovery timescale is several nanoseconds. This
timescale aligns with the extrapolated spin gap of $\sim$ 1 $\mu$eV, obtained
by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in the thermodynamic
limit. The consistency demonstrates the efficacy of tr-REXS in discerning
low-energy spin gaps inaccessible to conventional spectroscopic techniques.

<p>We investigate the loss of spatial coherence of one-dimensional bosonic gases
in optical lattices illuminated by a near-resonant excitation laser. Because
the atoms recoil in a random direction after each spontaneous emission, the
atomic momentum distribution progressively broadens. Equivalently, the spatial
correlation function (the Fourier-conjugate quantity of the momentum
distribution) progressively narrows down as more photons are scattered. Here we
measure the correlation function of the matter field for fixed distances
corresponding to nearest-neighbor (n-n) and next-nearest-neighbor (n-n-n) sites
of the optical lattice as a function of time, hereafter called n-n and n-n-n
correlators. For strongly interacting lattice gases, we find that the n-n
correlator $C_1$ decays as a power-law at long times, $C_1\propto
1/t^{\alpha}$, in stark contrast with the exponential decay expected for
independent particles. The power-law decay reflects a non-trivial dissipative
many-body dynamics, where interactions change drastically the interplay between
fluorescence destroying spatial coherence, and coherent tunnelling between
neighboring sites restoring spatial coherence at short distances. The observed
decay exponent $\alpha \approx 0.54(6) $ is in good agreement with the
prediction $\alpha=1/2$ from a dissipative Bose-Hubbard model accounting for
the fluorescence-induced decoherence. Furthermore, we find that the n-n
correlator $C_1$ controls the n-n-n correlator $C_2$ through the relation $C_2
\approx C_1^2$, also in accordance with the dissipative Bose-Hubbard model.

<p>Brownian motion is of central importance for understanding diffusive
transport in biology, chemistry, and physics. For spherical particles, the
theory was developed by Einstein, whereas a theoretical description of the
motion of spheroids was given by F. Perrin. Here, we report the systematic
verification of Perrin's theory 90 years after its publication. To this end, we
synthesized oblate and prolate core-shell spheroids with different aspect
ratios and tracked their three-dimensional diffusive motion in high dilution
using confocal fluorescence microscopy. The experimental data for the
dependence of translational and rotational diffusion on aspect ratio are in
excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. The crossover dynamics
from anisotropic to isotropic diffusion as a hallmark for translation rotation
coupling are also found as predicted. This verifies Perrin's theory as a
cornerstone for understanding diffusive transport and underlines the excellent
suitability of the particle system for testing more detailed theory.

<h3>Distance between two manifolds, topological phase transitions and  scaling laws</h3>

<br>
</p><i>ZhaoXiang Fang, Ming Gong, Guang-Can Guo, Yongxu Fu, Long Xiong</i>
<p>Topological phases are generally characterized by topological invariants
denoted by integer numbers. However, different topological systems often
require different topological invariants to measure, such as geometric phases,
topological orders, winding numbers, etc. Moreover, geometric phases and its
associated definitions usually fail at critical points. Therefore, it's
challenging to predict what would occur during the transformation between two
different topological phases. To address these issues, in this work, we propose
a general definition based on fidelity and trace distance from quantum
information theory: manifold distance. This definition does not rely on the
berry connection of the manifolds but rather on the information of the two
manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measure different
topological systems (including traditional band topology models, non-Hermitian
systems, and topological order models, etc.) and exhibit some universal laws
during the transformation between two topological phases. Our research
demonstrates that when the properties of two manifolds are identical, the
distance and associated higher-order derivatives between them can smoothly
transition to each other. However, for two different topological manifolds, the
higher-order derivatives exhibit various divergent behaviors near the critical
points. For subsequent studies, we expect the method to be generalized to
real-space or non-lattice models, in order to facilitate the study of a wider
range of physical platforms such as open systems and many-body localization.

</p><i>Bartosz Barzdajn, Christopher P Race</i>
<p>Understanding the nature of irradiation damage often requires a multi-scale
and multi-physics approach, i.e. it requires a significant amount of
information from experiments, simulations and phenomenological models. This
paper focuses on the initial stages of irradiation damage, namely
neutron-induced displacement cascades in zirconium, as nuclear-grade zirconium
alloys are widely used in fuel assemblies. We provide results of large-scale
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on existing inter-atomic potentials
and the two-temperature model to include the effect of electron-phonon
coupling. Our data can be used directly in higher scale methods. Furthermore,
we analysed summary statistics associated with defect production, such as the
number of defects produced, their distribution and the size of clusters. As a
result, we have developed a generative model of collision cascades. The model
is hierarchical, as well as stochastic, i.e. it includes the variance of the
considered features. This development had three main objectives: to establish a
sufficient descriptor of a cascade, to develop an interpolator of data obtained
from high-fidelity simulations, and to demonstrate that the statistical model
of the data can generate representative distributions of primary irradiation
defects. The results can be used to generate synthetic inputs for longer
length- and time-scale models, as well as to build fast approximations relating
dose, damage and irradiation conditions.

<p>Nonlocal order parameters capture the presence of correlated fluctuations
between specific degrees of freedom, in otherwise disordered quantum matter.
Here we provide a further example of their fundamental role, deriving the
ground state phase diagram of the filling one extended Bose Hubbard model
exclusively in terms of their ordering. By means of a density matrix
renormalization group numerical analysis, we show that besides the (even)
parity order characteristic of the Mott insulating phase, and the string order
non vanishing in the Haldane insulator, the recently proposed odd parity order
completes the picture, becoming nonvanishing at the transition from the normal
superfluid to the paired superfluid phase. The above three nonlocal parameters
capture all the distinct phases, including the density wave phase which local
order is seen as the simultaneous presence of correlated fluctuations in
different channels. They provide a unique tool for the experimental observation
of the full phase diagram of strongly correlated quantum matter, by means of
local density measurements.

<h3>Molecular dynamics simulations of the defect evolution in tungsten on  successive collision cascades</h3>

</p><i>Utkarsh Bhardwaj, Manoj Warrier</i>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of successive collision cascades within
the same simulation domain were performed using two different inter-atomic
potentials (IAP) in tungsten, one EAM based and the other a `quantum accurate'
machine learning potential, SNAP. The micro-structural changes are analyzed as
a function of displacements per atom (dpa) up-to irradiation dose of 3 dpa.
Five simulations are carried out at primary knock-on atom (PKA) energies of 20
keV and 50 keV for observing stochastic differences in the evolution of damage.
Results for the variation of the number of defects, number of defect clusters,
their size and morphology distribution are compared for the two energies and
two IAPs, up-to irradiation doses of 1-3 dpa.
It is seen that for a given IAP, the number density of defect clusters as a
function of dpa does not depend on the energy of the PKA used in the
simulations implying that, like dpa, it could be a good measure of material
property changes in irradiated materials. In contrast, the defect sizes depend
strongly on the energy of the PKA. It is also seen that the micro-structure
resulting from the EAM potential was mostly composed of <1 1 1> and <1 0 0>
dislocations, while that from the SNAP potential was mostly composed of small,
sessile, C15 ring like structures with a smattering of smaller <1 1 1>
dislocations and very few <1 0 0> dislocations. The significant disagreement
between the two IAPs with regard to defect morphology can be used for
validation by comparing against the experimental results of dislocation types,
density and size distributions.

system on the surface of TI nanowires with polygonal cross-sectional shape
adopts the corresponding polygonal shape. In a constant transverse magnetic
field, such an electronic system exhibits rich properties as different facets
of the polygon experience different values of the magnetic field due to the
changing magnetic field projection between facets. We investigate the energy
spectrum and transport properties of nanowires where we consider three
different polygonal shapes, all showing distinct properties visible in the
energy spectrum and transport properties. Here we propose that the wire
conductance can be used to differentiate between cross-sectional shapes of the
nanowire by rotating the magnetic field around the wire. Distinguishing between
the different shapes also works in the presence of impurities as long as
conductance steps are discernible, thus revealing the sub-band structure.

<p>Photo stimulated luminescent materials are one of the most attractive
alternatives for next generation optical information storage technologies.
However, there are still some challenges in regulating appropriate energy
levels in luminescent materials for optical information storage. Herein, a
green emission nanophosphor Zn2SiO4: Cr3+, Mn2+ with the trap depth of 1.05 eV,
fulfilling the requirements for optical information storage, was fabricated for
the first time through the solution combustion method and subsequent heat
treatment at 1000 degree centigrade for 2h. The crystal structure,
micromorphology, photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE),
and afterglow properties of Zn2SiO4: xCr3+, yMn2+ were studied systematically.
By applying the strategy of trap depth engineering, high trap density with
proper trap depth was observed when Cr3+ ions were introduced into Zn2SiO4:
Mn2+. Thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve analysis through the initial rise (IR)
method was conducted to gain some insight into the information of traps. As
proof of application, information storage was experimentally achieved by
choosing 275 nm illumination for information writing and 980 nm NIR excitation
for information reading. The results indicate that Zn2SiO4: Cr3+, Mn2+ phosphor
holds promise for potential applications in the field of optical information
storage.

<h3>A method for quantifying the generalization capabilities of generative  models for solving Ising models</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Qunlong Ma, Zhi Ma, Ming Gao</i>
<p>For Ising models with complex energy landscapes, whether the ground state can
be found by neural networks depends heavily on the Hamming distance between the
training datasets and the ground state. Despite the fact that various recently
proposed generative models have shown good performance in solving Ising models,
there is no adequate discussion on how to quantify their generalization
capabilities. Here we design a Hamming distance regularizer in the framework of
a class of generative models, variational autoregressive networks (VAN), to
quantify the generalization capabilities of various network architectures
combined with VAN. The regularizer can control the size of the overlaps between
the ground state and the training datasets generated by networks, which,
together with the success rates of finding the ground state, form a
quantitative metric to quantify their generalization capabilities. We conduct
numerical experiments on several prototypical network architectures combined
with VAN, including feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks,
and graph neural networks, to quantify their generalization capabilities when
solving Ising models. Moreover, considering the fact that the quantification of
the generalization capabilities of networks on small-scale problems can be used
to predict their relative performance on large-scale problems, our method is of
great significance for assisting in the Neural Architecture Search field of
searching for the optimal network architectures when solving large-scale Ising
models.

<p>Investigating the off-diagonal components of the conductivity and
thermoelectric tensor of materials hosting complex antiferromagnetic structures
has become a viable method to reveal the effects of topology and chirality on
the electronic transport in these systems. In this respect, Mn$_5$Si$_3$ is an
interesting metallic compound that exhibits several antiferromagnetic phases
below 100 K with different collinear and noncollinear arrangements of Mn
magnetic moments. Previous investigations have shown that the transitions
between the various phases give rise to large changes of the anomalous Hall
effect. Here, we report measurements of the anomalous Nernst effect of
Mn$_5$Si$_3$ single crystals. Below 25 K we observe a sign change of the
zero-field Nernst signal with a concomitant decrease of the Hall signal and a
gradual reduction of the remanent magnetization which we attribute to a subtle
rearrangement of the magnetic moment configuration at low temperatures.

<p>A single layer ferromagnetic film magnetized in the plane of an ac current
flow, exhibits a characteristic Hall voltage with harmonic and second harmonic
components, which is attributed to the presence of spin currents with
polarization non-collinear with the magnetization. A set of 30 nm thick
permalloy (Py) films used in this study are deposited at an oblique angle with
respect to the substrate plane which induces an in-plane easy axis in the
magnetization of the initial nucleating layers of the films which is distinct
from the overall bulk magnetic properties of the film. This unusual magnetic
texture provides a platform for the direct detection of inverse spin Hall
effect in Hall bar shaped macroscopic devices at room temperatures which we
denote as Anomalous Inverse Spin Hall Effect (AISHE). Control samples
fabricated by normal deposition of permalloy with slow rotation of substrate
shows significant reduction of the harmonic Hall signal that further
substantiates the model. The analysis of the second harmonic Hall signal
corroborates the presence of spin-orbit torque arising from the unconventional
spin-currents in the single-layer ferromagnets.

<p>Van der Waals assembly allows for the creation of Josephson junctions in an
atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) flakes that are twisted relative
to each other. In a narrow range of angles close to $45^\circ$, the junction
exhibits a regime where time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken and
it can be used to encode an inherently protected qubit called flowermon. In
this work we investigate the physics emerging when two such junctions are
integrated in a SQuID circuit threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the
flowermon qubit regime is maintained up to a finite critical value of the
magnetic field and, under appropriate conditions, it is protected against both
charge and flux noise. For larger external fluxes, the interplay between the
inherent twisted d-wave nature of the order parameter and the external magnetic
flux enables the implementation of different artificial atoms, including a
flux-biased protected qubit and a supersymmetric quantum circuit.

chalcogenide conductors in Li$_2$BMQ$_4$ (2114, B = Ca, Sr and Ba; M = Si, Ge

thermodynamically and kinetically stable sulfides and selenides in this new
system exhibit ultralow Li$^+$ ion migration activation energy (0.16 eV ~ 0.56
eV) and considerable bandgaps varying between ~ 2 eV and 3.5 eV. We have
successfully synthesized Li$_2$BaSnS$_4$ and Li$_2$SrSiS$_4$, and they exhibit
excellent moisture stability through H$_2$S gas measurements. Electrochemical
impedance measurements indicate 2114 systems show the typical features of solid
ionic conductors, with a room-temperature Li$^+$ conductivity close to
5$\times$10$^{-4}$ mS/cm aligning with our molecular dynamics simulations.
Furthermore, we have theoretically investigated the substitution of Cl$^-$ at
S$^{2-}$ site. The doped compounds display significantly higher conductivity,
with an increase of about three orders of magnitude (up to a maximum of 0.72
mS/cm) compared to the undoped compounds. These findings offer valuable
insights for the further exploration of potential chalcogenide solid
electrolyte materials with robust air stability and enhanced ionic conductivity

<p>The smooth emergence of shear elasticity is an hallmark of the liquid to
glass transition. In a liquid, viscous stresses arise from local structural
rearrangements. In the solid, Eshelby has shown that stresses around an
inclusion decay as a power law $r^{-D}$, where $D$ is the dimension of the
system. We study glass-forming hard sphere fluids by simulation and observe the
emergence of the unscreened power-law Eshelby pattern in the stress
correlations of the isotropic liquid state. By a detailed tensorial analysis,
we show that the fluctuating force field, viz.~the divergence of the stress
field, relaxes to zero with time in all states, while the shear stress
correlations develop spatial power-law structures inside regions that grow with
longitudinal and transverse sound speeds; we observe the predicted exponents
$r^{-D}$ and $r^{-D-2}$. In Brownian systems, shear stresses relax diffusively
within these regions, with the diffusion coefficient determined by the shear
modulus and the friction coefficient.

<p>We present a thorough investigation of the physical properties and
superconductivity of the binary intermetallic V2Ga5. Electrical resistivity and
specific heat measurements show that V2Ga5 enters its superconducting state
below Tsc = 3.5 K, with a critical field of Hc2,perp c(Hc2,para c) = 6.5(4.1)
kOe. With H perp c, the peak effect was observed in resistivity measurements,
indicating the ultrahigh quality of the single crystal studied. The resistivity
measurements under high pressure reveal that the Tsc is suppressed linearly
with pressure and reaches absolute zero around 20 GPa. Specific heat and muon
spin relaxation measurements both indicate that the two-gap s-wave model best
describes the superconductivity of V2Ga5. The spectra obtained from
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements suggest that two
superconducting gaps open at the Fermi surface around the Z and {\Gamma}
points. These results are verified by first-principles band structure
calculations. We therefore conclude that V2Ga5 is a phonon-mediated two-gap
s-wave superconductor

<p>We give a detailed and self-contained description of a recently developed
theoretical and numerical method for the simulation of three identical bosonic
alkali-metal atoms near a Feshbach resonance, where the Efimov effect is
induced. The method is based on a direct construction of the off-shell two-body
transition matrix from exact eigenfunctions of the embedded two-body
Hamiltonians, obtained using realistic parameterizations of the interaction
potentials which accurately reproduce the molecular energy levels. The
transition matrix is then inserted into the appropriate three-body integral
equations, which may be efficiently solved on a computer. We focus especially
on the power of our method in including rigorously the effects of multichannel
physics on the three-body problem, which are usually accounted for only by
various approximations. We demonstrate the method for ${}^7$Li, where we
recently showed that a correct inclusion of this multichannel physics resolves
the long-standing disagreement between theory and experiment regarding the
Efimovian three-body parameter. We analyze the Efimovian enhancement of the
three-body recombination rate on both sides of the Feshbach resonance,
revealing strong sensitivity to the spin structure of the model thus indicating
the prevalence of three-body spin-exchange physics. Finally, we discuss an
extension of our methodology to the calculation of three-body bound-state
energies.

<p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers the possibility to observe and control
the motion of few or individual atoms, enabling the realization of various
quantum technological tasks such as quantum-enhanced metrology or quantum
simulation of strongly-correlated matter. A core limitation of these
experiments lies in the mode structure of the cavity field, which is hard-coded
in the shape and geometry of the mirrors. As a result, most applications of
cavity QED trade spatial resolution for enhanced sensitivity. Here, we propose
and demonstrate a cavity-microscope device capable of controlling in space and
time the coupling between atoms and light in a single-mode high-finesse cavity,
reaching a spatial resolution an order-of-magnitude lower than the cavity mode
waist. This is achieved through local Floquet engineering of the atomic level
structure, imprinting a corresponding atom-field coupling. We illustrate this
capability by engineering micrometer-scale coupling, using cavity-assisted
atomic measurements and optimization. Our system forms an optical device with a
single optical axis and has the same footprint and complexity as a standard
Fabry-Perot cavity or confocal lens pair, and can be used for any atomic
species. This technique opens a wide range of perspectives from ultra-fast,
cavity-enhanced mid-circuit readout to the quantum simulation of fully

<p>In this work, we introduce a predictive approach for determining fracture
nucleation in thermosets based on shortest paths (SPs) of the network topology.
This method enumerates SP sets in networks with periodic boundary conditions,
with applications to both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. We find that
network fracture is most likely to nucleate on the first (shortest) SP and the
strain at nucleation is linearly correlated with the topological path length.
Subsequent fracture events are dictated by the instantaneous SP of partially
broken networks. We further quantify the length scale dependence of SP
distributions, introducing a means of bridging simulated and experimental
fracture profiles.

intense interest in academia and industry, and continues to do so. Despite its
deceivingly simple chemical composition, the ferroelectric physics supported by
HfO$_2$ is remarkably complex, arguably rivaling that of perovskite
ferroelectrics. Computational investigations, especially those utilizing
first-principles density functional theory (DFT), have significantly advanced
our understanding of the nature of ferroelectricity in these thin films. In
this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of the computational efforts to
understand ferroelectric hafnia, comparing various metastable polar phases and
examining the critical factors necessary for their stabilization. The intricate
nature of HfO$_2$ is intimately related to the complex interplay among diverse
structural polymorphs, dopants and their charge-compensating oxygen vacancies,
and unconventional switching mechanisms of domains and domain walls, which can
sometimes yield conflicting theoretical predictions and
theoretical-experimental discrepancies. We also discuss opportunities enabled

go beyond DFT modeling, probing the dynamical properties of ferroelectric

</p><i>Hongbin Wu, Jin Lan</i>
<p>A vortex, a circulating flow around a void, is one of the basic topological
phenomena in nature. Here we show that vortices generally emerge in spin wave
travelling upon topologically nontrivial magnetic texture, due to the
transverse precession of spin wave about the background magnetization. The
winding number of each spin wave vortex is equivalent to sign of the local
topological density of magnetic texture at the vortex core, and all winding
numbers add up as twice the topological number of the magnetic texture. Based
on the charts of spin wave vortices, the magnetization profile of the magnetic
texture is reversely constructed, and a universal relation for the magnon
topological Hall angle is theoretically proposed and numerically confirmed in
vast types of magnetic textures. The simple connection between dynamic and
static magnetizations, promotes spin wave vortex as a powerful tool to reveal
the topology of the underlying magnetic texture.

<p>We theoretically investigate the transport properties of Josephson junctions
composed of superconductor/minimally twisted bilayer graphene/superconductor
structures. In the presence of an out-of-plane electric field, the low energy
physics is best described by a network of chiral domain-wall states. Depending
on system parameters, they lead to the emergence of zig-zag or pseudo-Landau
level modes with distinct transport characteristics. Specifically, we find
zig-zag modes feature linear dispersion of Andreev bound states, resulting in a
$4\pi$-periodic Josephson current. In contrast, pseudo-Landau level modes
exhibit flat Andreev bound states and, consequently, a vanishing bulk Josephson
current. Interestingly, edge states can give rise to $4\pi$-periodic Josephson
response in the pseudo-Landau level regime. We also discuss experimental
signatures of such responses.

<p>A detailed understanding of the material properties that affect the splitting
between the two low-lying valley states in Si/SiGe heterostructures will be
increasingly important as the number of spin qubits is increased. Scanning gate
microscopy has been proposed as a method to measure the spatial variation of
the valley splitting as a tip-induced dot is moved around in the plane of the
Si quantum well. We develop a simulation using an electrostatic model of the
scanning gate microscope tip and the overlapping gate structure combined with
an approximate solution to the three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation
in the device stack. Using this simulation, we show that a tip-induced quantum
dot formed near source and drain electrodes can be adiabatically moved to a
region far from the gate electrodes. We argue that by spatially translating the
tip-induced dot across a defect in the Si/SiGe interface, changes in valley
splitting can be detected.

</p><i>Yasuhiro Utsumi</i>
<p>We perform network analysis of a system described by the master equation to
estimate the lower bound of the steady-state current noise, starting from the
level 2.5 large deviation function and using the graph theory approach. When
the transition rates are uniform, and the system is driven to a non-equilibrium
steady state by unidirectional transitions, we derive a noise lower bound,
which accounts for fluctuations of sojourn times at all states and is expressed
using mesh currents. This bound is applied to the uncertainty in the
signal-to-noise ratio of the fluctuating computation time of a schematic
Brownian computation plus reset process described by a graph containing one
cycle. Unlike the mixed and pseudo-entropy bounds that increase logarithmically
with the length of the intended computation path, this bound depends on the
number of extraneous predecessors and thus captures the logical
irreversibility.

</p><i>Eric Nilsson, Ulf Gran, Johannes Hofmann</i>
<p>Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on
quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay
rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems,
however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed "odd-parity" modes).
Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of
relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this
method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with
screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle
modes beyond the asymptotic low temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature,
thus covering the temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the
existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a
comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum.
In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates
extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.1T_F$; (ii) there is only a small
number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining
modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling; (iii) the ratio between the odd-
and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, not
just temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation
mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the
nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge
a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.

that the electronic structure can be modified using staggered exchange fields

Additionally, spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity are investigated

similar function is also attained entirely by the bandgap light due to the
substrate photovoltaic effect. Moreover, an all-optical way to imprint and
recover graphene magnetoresistance by light is reported as well as magnetic
control of graphene transconductance. These findings extend photoferroelectric
control in 2D structures to new a magnetic dimension and advance wireless
operation for sensors and field-effect transistors.

<p>Controlling microstructure in fusion-based metal additive manufacturing (AM)
remains a challenge due to numerous parameters directly impacting
solidification conditions. Multiprincipal element alloys (MPEAs) offer a vast
compositional design space for microstructural engineering due to their
chemical complexity and exceptional properties. Here, we establish a novel
alloy design paradigm in MPEAs for AM using the FeMnCoCr system. By exploiting
the decreasing phase stability with increasing Mn content, we achieve notable
grain refinement and breakdown of columnar grain growth. We combine
thermodynamic modeling, operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction, multiscale
microstructural characterization, and mechanical testing to gain insight into
the solidification physics and its ramifications on the resulting
microstructure. This work paves way for tailoring grain sizes through targeted
manipulation of phase stability, thereby advancing microstructure control in
AM.

<p>Large language models (LLMs) such as generative pretrained transformers
(GPTs) have shown potential for various commercial applications, but their
applicability for materials design remains underexplored. In this article, we
introduce AtomGPT, a model specifically developed for materials design based on
transformer architectures, to demonstrate the capability for both atomistic
property prediction and structure generation. We show that a combination of
chemical and structural text descriptions can efficiently predict material
properties with accuracy comparable to graph neural network models, including
formation energies, electronic bandgaps from two different methods and
superconducting transition temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
AtomGPT can generate atomic structures for tasks such as designing new
superconductors, with the predictions validated through density functional
theory calculations. This work paves the way for leveraging LLMs in forward and
inverse materials design, offering an efficient approach to the discovery and
optimization of materials.
