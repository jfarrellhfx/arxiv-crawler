<h3>$d$-mon: transmon with strong anharmonicity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02547" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02547</a>

We propose a novel qubit architecture based on a planar $c$-axis Josephson
junction between a thin flake $d$-wave superconductor ($d$SC), such as a
high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$, and a conventional $s$-wave
superconductor. When operated in the transmon regime the device -- that we call
``$d$-mon'' -- becomes insensitive to offset charge fluctuations and,
importantly, exhibits at the same time energy level spectrum with strong
anharmonicity that is widely tunable through the device geometry and applied
magnetic flux. Crucially, unlike previous qubit designs based on $d$-wave
superconductors the proposed device operates in a regime where quasiparticles
are fully gapped and can be therefore expected to achieve long coherence times.

<h3>Dynamic Phases and Combing Effects for Elongated Particles Moving Over  Quenched Disorder</h3>

We consider a two-dimensional system of elongated particles driven over a
random quenched disorder landscape. For varied pinning site density, external
drive magnitude, and particle elongation, we find a wide variety of dynamic
phases, including random structures, stripe or combed phases with nematic
order, and clogged states. The different regimes can be identified by examining
nematic ordering, cluster size, number of pinned particles, and transverse
diffusion. In some regimes we find that the pinning can enhance the particle
alignment, producing a nonmonotonic signature in the nematic ordering with a
maximum at a particular combination of pinning density and drive. The optimal
nematic occurs when a sufficient number of particles can be pinned, generating
a local shear and leading to what we call a combing effect. At high drives, the
combing effect is reduced when the number of pinned particles decreases. For
stronger pinning, the particles form a heterogeneous clustered or clogged state
that depins into a fluctuating state with high diffusion.

<h3>Maximal entropy random walks on tree-like graphs with a single entropic  trap: critical behavior and finite size effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02611" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02611</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
It is known that maximal entropy random walks on graphs tend to get localized
in the vicinity of nodes with a large degree. Here we revisit the simplest toy
model of such a localization - a regular tree of degree $p$ with one special
node ("root") which has a degree different from all others. We present an
in-depth study of the behavior of maximal entropy random walk at exactly at the
localization transition. We study walks starting from the root on both infinite
trees and finite locally-tree-like regular random graphs (RRG). For the
infinite tree we prove that the probability distribution function of the walker
is a step function with the position of the shock moving away from the root
with constant velocity $v=(p-2)/p$ and find the width and asymptotic shape of
the distribution in the vicinity of the shock. For a finite RRG we show that
critical slowdown takes place and the time (trajectory length) needed to reach
the equilibrium distribution is of order $\sqrt{N}$ instead of $\log_{p-1}N$
away from the transition. We calculate the exact value of equilibrium
distribution and relaxation time, as well as the shape of slowly relaxing
modes.

<h3>Nature of even and odd magic angles in helical twisted trilayer graphene</h3>

Helical twisted trilayer graphene exhibits zero-energy flat bands with large
degeneracy in the chiral limit. The flat bands emerge at a discrete set of
magic twist angles and feature properties intrinsically distinct from those
realized in twisted bilayer graphene. Their degeneracy and the associated band
Chern numbers depend on the parity of the magic angles. Two degenerate flat
bands with Chern numbers $C_A=2$ and $C_B=-1$ arise at odd magic angles,
whereas even magic angles display four flat bands, with Chern number
$C_{A/B}=\pm1$, together with a Dirac cone crossing at zero energy. All bands
are sublattice polarized. We demonstrate the structure behind these flat bands
and obtain analytical expressions for the wavefunctions in all cases. Each
magic angle is identified with the vanishing of a zero-mode wavefunction at
high-symmetry position and momentum. The whole analytical structure results
from whether the vanishing is linear or quadratic for the, respectively, odd
and even magic angle. The $C_{3z}$ and $C_{2y}T$ symmetries are shown to play a
key role in establishing the flat bands. In contrast, the particle-hole
symmetry is not essential, except from gapping out the crossing Dirac cone at
even magic angles.

<h3>Spectral properties of disordered Ising superconductors with singlet and  triplet pairing in in-plane magnetic fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02646" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02646</a>

<br>
We study the spectral properties of disordered superconductors with Ising
spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) subjected to in-plane magnetic fields. In addition
to the conventional singlet pairing, we also consider the recently proposed
equal-spin triplet pairing, which couples to the singlet at finite in-plane
magnetic fields. While both singlet and triplet order parameters are immune to
intravalley scattering, they are significantly affected by intervalley
scattering. In the realistic regime of strong ISOC, we find that the properties
of the superconductor are well described by a simple formula reminiscent of the
well-known Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory, but with a modified self-consistency
condition. Our results enable straightforward self-consistent calculation of
singlet and triplet order parameters and the density of states of disordered
Ising superconductors, which can be particularly useful for interpreting recent
tunneling spectroscopy experiments in these systems. We also investigate the
high-energy features in the density of states, the so-called mirage gaps, and
discuss how they are modified by triplet pairing.

<h3>Enhancing variational Monte Carlo using a programmable quantum simulator</h3>

Programmable quantum simulators based on Rydberg atom arrays are a
fast-emerging quantum platform, bringing together long coherence times,
high-fidelity operations, and large numbers of interacting qubits
deterministically arranged in flexible geometries. Today's Rydberg array
devices are demonstrating their utility as quantum simulators for studying
phases and phase transitions in quantum matter. In this paper, we show that
unprocessed and imperfect experimental projective measurement data can be used
to enhance in silico simulations of quantum matter, by improving the
performance of variational Monte Carlo simulations. As an example, we focus on
data spanning the disordered-to-checkerboard transition in a $16 \times 16$
square lattice array [S. Ebadi et al. Nature 595, 227 (2021)] and employ
data-enhanced variational Monte Carlo to train powerful autoregressive
wavefunction ans\"atze based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We observe
universal improvements in the convergence times of our simulations with this
hybrid training scheme. Notably, we also find that pre-training with
experimental data enables relatively simple RNN ans\"atze to accurately capture
phases of matter that are not learned with a purely variational training
approach. Our work highlights the promise of hybrid quantum--classical
approaches for large-scale simulation of quantum many-body systems, combining
autoregressive language models with experimental data from existing quantum
devices.

<h3>Observation of Fractionally Quantized Anomalous Hall Effect</h3>

The integer quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a lattice analog of the
quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field. This striking transport phenomenon
occurs in electronic systems with topologically nontrivial bands and
spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Discovery of its putative
fractional counterpart in the presence of strong electron correlations, i.e.,
the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, would open a new chapter
in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the direct observation of both
integer and fractional QAH effects in electrical measurements on twisted
bilayer MoTe$_2$. At zero magnetic field, near filling factor $\nu = -1$ (one
hole per moir\'e unit cell) we see an extended integer QAH plateau in the Hall
resistance $R_\text{xy}$ that is quantized to $h/e^2 \pm 0.1 \%$ while the
longitudinal resistance $R_\text{xx}$ vanishes. Remarkably, at $\nu=-2/3$ and
$-3/5$ we see plateau features in $R_\text{xy}$ at $3h/2e^2 \pm 1\%$ and
$5h/3e^2 \pm 3\%$, respectively, while $R_\text{xx}$ remains small. All these
features shift linearly in an applied magnetic field with slopes matching the
corresponding Chern numbers $-1$, $-2/3$, and $-3/5$, precisely as expected for
integer and fractional QAH states. In addition, at zero magnetic field,
$R_\text{xy}$ is approximately $2h/e^2$ near half filling ($\nu = -1/2$) and
varies linearly as $\nu$ is tuned. This behavior resembles that of the
composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled lowest Landau level of a
two-dimensional electron gas at high magnetic field. Direct observation of the
FQAH and associated effects paves the way for researching charge
fractionalization and anyonic statistics at zero magnetic field.

<h3>Vortex Lattices in Strongly Confined Quantum Droplets</h3>

Bose mixture quantum droplets display a fascinating stability that relies on
quantum fluctuations to prevent collapse driven by mean-field effects. Most
droplet research focuses on untrapped or weakly trapped scenarios, where the
droplets exhibit a liquid-like flat density profile. When weakly trapped
droplets rotate, they usually respond through center-of-mass motion or
splitting instability. Here, we study rapidly rotating droplets in the strong
external confinement limit where the external potential prevents splitting and
the center-of-mass excitation. We find that quantum droplets form a triangular
vortex lattice as in single-component repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates
(BEC), but the overall density follows the analytical Thomas-Fermi profile
obtained from a cubic equation. We observe three significant differences
between rapidly rotating droplets and repulsive BECs. First, the vortex core
size changes markedly at finite density, visible in numerically obtained
density profiles. We analytically estimate the vortex core sizes from the
droplets' coherence length and find good agreement with the numerical results.
Second, the change in the density profile gives a slight but observable
distortion to the lattice, which agrees with the distortion expected due to
nonuniform superfluid density. Lastly, unlike a repulsive BEC, which expands
substantially as the rotation frequency approaches the trapping frequency,
rapidly rotating droplets show only a fractional change in their size. We argue
that this last point can be used to create clouds with lower filling factors,
which may facilitate reaching the elusive strongly correlated regime.

<h3>Soliton motion induced along ferromagnetic skyrmion chains in chiral  thin nanotracks</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using atomistic magnetic simulations we investigate the soliton motion along
a pinned skyrmion chain containing an interstitial skyrmion. We find that the
soliton can exhibit stable motion along the chain without a skyrmion Hall
effect for an extended range of drives. Under a constant drive the solitons
have a constant velocity. We also measure the skyrmion velocity-current curves
and identify the signatures of different phases including a pinned phase,
stable soliton motion, and quasi-free motion at higher drives where all of the
skyrmions depin from the pinning centers and move along the rigid wall. In the
quasi-free motion regime, the velocity is oscillatory due to the motion of the
skyrmions over the pinning sites. For increasing pinning strength, the onset of
soliton motion shifts to higher values of current density. We also find that
for stronger pinning, the characteristic velocity-current shape is affected by
the annihilation of single or multiple skyrmions in the drive interval over
which the soliton motion occurs. Our results indicate that stable skyrmion
soliton motion is possible and could be useful for technological applications.

<h3>Kinetics of Li transport in vanadium-based disordered rocksalt  structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02725</a>

Disordered rocksalt Li-excess (DRX) compounds have emerged as promising new
cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, as they can consist solely of
resource-abundant metals and eliminate the need for cobalt or nickel. A deeper
understanding of the lithium-ion transport kinetics in DRX compounds is
essential for enhancing their rate performance. This study employs
first-principles calculations, cluster expansion techniques, and kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations to investigate the Li+ transport properties in DRX Li2-xVO3,
where 0 <= x <= 1. Our findings underscore (i) the necessity of accounting for
both tetrahedral and octahedral Li occupancy when predicting the transport
properties in DRX materials, (ii) the factors influencing the variation in the
diffusion coefficients with Li content in Li2-xVO3, and (iii) the impact of Li+
correlated motion on the kinetics of Li+ transport. We reveal that the relative
stability of tetrahedral and octahedral Li determines the number of active
sites within the percolation network, subsequently affecting the Li+ transport
properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the wide site-energy distribution
causes correlated motion in Li2-xVO3, which hinders Li+ transport. Although our
study focuses on Li2-xVO3 as a model system, the insights gained apply to all
DRX materials, given their inherently broader site-energy distributions.

Periodically driven (Floquet) systems can exhibit new possibilities beyond
what can be obtained in equilibrium. Both in Floquet systems and in the related
problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic
distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical
operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some
local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a
locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then
classify non-interacting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing
that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy
equivalence.

<h3>The role of Coulomb interaction on the electronic properties of  monolayer NiX$_2$ (X = S, Se): A DFT+U+V study</h3>

The electronic structure of Nickel dichalcogenides, NiS$_2$ and NiSe$_2$, in
monolayer form, is studied employing first-principles methods. We assess the
importance of band ordering, covalency and Coulomb interactions in the ground
state of these systems. Hybrid functional results are compared with standard
functionals and also with Hubbard-corrected functionals to systematically
address the role of electronic interactions and localization. We found that
mean-field correlation realized by intersite Hubbard interactions are directly
linked to the magnitude of the energy band gap, giving compelling evidence for
the presence of a charge transfer insulating phase in these materials.

<h3>Critical exponents and fluctuations at BEC in a 2D harmonically trapped  ideal gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02744" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02744</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The critical properties displayed by an ideal 2D Bose gas trapped in a
harmonic potential are determined and characterized in an exact numerical
fashion. Beyond thermodynamics, addressed in terms of the global pressure and
volume which are the appropriate variables of a fluid confined in a non-uniform
harmonic potential, the density-density correlation function is also calculated
and the corresponding correlation length is found. Evaluation of all these
quantities as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is approached manifest its
critical continuous phase transition character. The divergence of the
correlation length as the critical temperature is reached, unveils the expected
spatial scale invariance proper of a critical transition. The logarithmic
singularities of this transition are traced back to the non-analytic behavior
of the thermodynamic variables at vanishing chemical potential, which is the
onset of BEC. The critical exponents associated with the ideal BEC transition
in the 2D inhomogeneous fluid reveals its own universality class.

<h3>Probing charge order of monolayer NbSe$_2$ within a bulk crystal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides can exhibit markedly
different electronic properties compared to their bulk counterparts. In the
case of NbSe$_2$, the question of whether its charge density wave (CDW) phase
is enhanced in the monolayer limit has been the subject of intense debate,
primarily due to the difficulty of decoupling this order from its environment.
Here, we address this challenge by using a misfit crystal that comprises
NbSe$_2$ monolayers separated by SnSe rock-salt spacers, a structure that
allows us to investigate a monolayer crystal embedded in a bulk matrix. We
establish an effective monolayer electronic behavior of the misfit crystal by
studying its transport properties and visualizing its electronic structure by
angle-resolved photoemission measurements. We then investigate the emergence of
the CDW by tracking the temperature dependence of its collective modes. Our
findings reveal a nearly sixfold enhancement in the CDW transition temperature,
providing compelling evidence for the profound impact of dimensionality on
charge order formation in NbSe$_2$.

<h3>Quasiparticle and Transport Properties of Disordered Bilayer Graphene</h3>

In recent experimental and theoretical studies of graphene, disorder
scattering processes have been suggested to play an important role in its
electronic and transport properties. In the preceding paper, it has been shown
that the nonperturbative momentum-space Lanczos method is able to accurately
describe all the multiple impurity scattering events and account for the
quasiparticle and transport properties of disordered monolayer graphene. In the
present study, we expand the range of applicability of this recursive method by
numerically investigating the quasiparticle and transport properties of
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene in the presence of scalar Anderson disorder.
The results are further compared with the findings of the same system using a
self-consistent Born approximation, as well as the central findings in the
preceding paper for monolayer graphene. It is found that in both systems,
proper inclusions of all the scattering events are needed in order to reliably
capture the role of disorder via multiple impurity scattering. In particular,
the quasiparticle residue is shown to decrease sharply near the charge
neutrality point, suggesting that the system is either a marginal Fermi liquid
or a non-Fermi liquid. Furthermore, we reveal the dependences of the transport
properties of disordered bilayer graphene on the carrier density and
temperature, and explore the role of interlayer scattering at varying
strengths. Our findings help to provide some new angles into the quasiparticle
and transport properties of disordered bilayer graphene.

<br>
The Ce$^{3+}$ pseudospin-1/2 degrees of freedom in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ possess
both dipolar and octupolar character which enables the possibility of novel
quantum spin liquid ground states in this material. Here we report new muon
spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements on single crystal samples
of Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ in zero magnetic field and in magnetic fields directed
along the $[1,\bar{1},0]$ and $[1,1,1]$ crystallographic directions, and for
magnetic fields directed both longitudinal and transverse to the direction of
muon polarization. Our zero-field results show no signs of magnetic ordering or
spin freezing, consistent with earlier zero-field $\mu$SR measurements on a
powder sample of Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, and also with the expectations for a
quantum spin ice. However, we measure a more gentle relaxation rate for
Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ in zero-field at low temperatures than was previously
reported. This difference in relaxation rate is likely due to the low
oxidation, and correspondingly, the high stoichiometry of our single crystal
samples. Longitudinal field measurements confirm that the magnetic dipole
moments in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ remain dynamic at $T = 0.1$ $\mathrm{K}$. For both
$[1,\bar{1},0]$ and $[1,1,1]$ magnetic fields, our $\mu$SR Knight shift
measurements show a field-induced leveling off of the magnetic susceptibility
at low temperature which is qualitatively consistent with corresponding
calculations using the numerical-linked-cluster method in combination with
recent estimates for the nearest-neighbour exchange parameters of
Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$

Semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit high mobility,
strong spin-orbit coupling, and large effective masses, which simultaneously
leads to a rich wealth of Landau quantizations and inherently strong electronic
interactions. However, in spite of their extensively explored Landau levels
(LL) structure, probing electron correlations in the fractionally filled LL
regime has not been possible due to the difficulty of reaching the quantum
limit. Here, we report evidence for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states at
filling fractions 4/5 and 2/5 in the lowest LL of bilayer MoS$_{2}$, manifested
in fractionally quantized transverse conductance plateaus accompanied by
longitudinal resistance minima. We further show that the observed FQH states
result from and sensitively depend on the dielectric and gate screening of the
Coulomb interactions. Our findings establish a new FQH experimental platform
which are a scarce resource: it is tunable by Coulomb-screening engineering and
as such, is the missing link between atomically thin graphene and
semiconducting quantum wells.

Contraction and expansion of skyrmions in ferromagnetic films are
investigated. In centrosymmetric systems, the dynamics of a collapsing skyrmion
is driven by dissipation. The collapse time has a minimum on the damping
constant. In systems with broken inversion symmetry, the evolution of skyrmions
toward equilibrium size is driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
Expressions describing the time dependence of the skyrmion size are derived and
their implications for skyrmion-based information processing are discussed.

<h3>Analytical results for a spin-orbit coupled atom held in a non-Hermitian  double well under synchronous combined modulation</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a simple method of synchronous combined modulations to generate
the exact analytic solutions for a spin-orbit (SO) coupled ultracold atom held
in a non-Hermitian double-well potential. Based on the obtained analytical
solutions, we mainly study the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry of this
system and the system stability for both balanced and unbalanced gain-loss
between two wells. Under balanced gain and loss, the effect of the proportional
constants between synchronous combined modulations and the SO-coupling strength
on the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking is revealed analytically. Surprisingly,
we find when the Zeeman field is present, the stable spin-flipping tunneling
between two wells can not occur in the non-Hermitian SO-coupled ultracold
atomic system, but the stable spin-conserving tunneling can be performed. Under
unbalanced gain and loss, the unique set of parameter conditions that can cause
the system to stabilize is found. The results may provide a possibility for the
exact control of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking and quantum spin dynamics in
a non-Hermitian SO-coupled system.

The metal-hydride-based topochemical reduction process has produced novel
thermodynamically unstable phases across various transition metal oxide series
with unusual crystal structures and non-trivial ground states. Here, by such an
oxygen (de-) intercalation method we synthesis a novel samarium nickelate with
ordered nickel valences associated with tri-component coordination
configurations. This structure, with a formula of Sm$_{9}$Ni$_{9}$O$_{22}$ as
revealed by four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, emerges
from the intricate planes of {303}$_{\text{pc}}$ ordered apical oxygen
vacancies. X-ray spectroscopy measurements and ab-initio calculations show the
coexistence of square-planar, pyramidal and octahedral Ni sites with mono-, bi-
and tri-valences. It leads to an intense orbital polarization, charge-ordering,
and a ground state with a strong electron localization marked by the
disappearance of ligand-hole configuration at low-temperature. This new
nickelate compound provides another example of previously inaccessible
materials enabled by topotactic transformations and presents a unique platform
where mixed Ni valence can give rise to exotic phenomena.

Different dynamical states ranging from coherent, incoherent to chimera,
multichimera, and related transitions are addressed in a globally coupled
nonlinear continuum chemical oscillator system by implementing a modified
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Besides dynamical identifications of observed
states using standard qualitative metrics, we systematically acquire
nonequilibrium thermodynamic characterizations of these states obtained via
coupling parameters. The nonconservative work profiles in collective dynamics
qualitatively reflect the time-integrated concentration of the activator, and
the majority of the nonconservative work contributes to the entropy production
over the spatial dimension. It is illustrated that the evolution of spatial
entropy production and semigrand Gibbs free energy profiles associated with
each state are connected yet completely out of phase, and these thermodynamic
signatures are extensively elaborated to shed light on the exclusiveness and
similarities of these states. Moreover, a relationship between the proper
nonequilibrium thermodynamic potential and the variance of activator
concentration is established by exhibiting both quantitative and qualitative
similarities between a Fano factor-like entity, derived from the activator
concentration, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence associated with the
transition from a nonequilibrium homogeneous state to an inhomogeneous state.
Quantifying the thermodynamic costs for collective dynamical states would aid
in efficiently controlling, manipulating, and sustaining such states to explore
the real-world relevance and applications of these states.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we consider the dynamics of charge imbalance resolved
negativity after a local joining quench. We first study the local joining
quench by applying the CFT approach. We calculate the quench dynamics of
charged logarithmic negativity. By using the Fourier transformation, we obtain
the charge imbalance resolved negativity. Then the total negativity can be
recovered from the charged imbalance resolved ones. We test our CFT predictions
in the lattice model numerically. Finally, we explain our results based on the
quasi-particle picture.

Metal hydrides are promising candidates for hydrogen storage applications.
From a materials discovery perspective, an accurate, efficient computational
workflow is urgently required that can rapidly analyze/predict thermodynamic
properties of these materials. The authors have recently introduced a
thermodynamic property calculation framework based on the lattice reverse Monte
Carlo (RMC) method. Here the approach is extended to metal hydrides, which
exhibit significant volume expansion, strong interaction between hydrogen and
the host atoms, lattice strain, and a phase transition. We apply the technique
to the nickel hydride (NiH_x) system by calculating the
pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) isotherm and constructing its phase
diagram. An attractive feature of our approach is that the entire phase diagram
can be accurately constructed in few minutes by considering <10 configurations.
In contrast, a popular technique based on grand canonical Monte Carlo would
require sampling of several million configurations. The computational workflow
presented paves the way for the approach to be used in future for wider
materials search and discovery.

<h3>Improving realistic material property prediction using domain adaptation  based machine learning</h3>

Materials property prediction models are usually evaluated using random
splitting of datasets into training and test datasets, which not only leads to
over-estimated performance due to inherent redundancy, typically existent in
material datasets, but also deviate away from the common practice of materials
scientists: they are usually interested in predicting properties for a known
subset of related out-of-distribution (OOD) materials rather than a universally
distributed samples. Feeding such target material formulas/structures to the
machine learning models should improve the prediction performance while most
current machine learning (ML) models neglect this information. Here we propose
to use domain adaptation (DA) to enhance current ML models for property
prediction and evaluate their performance improvements in a set of five
realistic application scenarios. Our systematic benchmark studies show that
there exist DA models that can significantly improve the OOD test set
prediction performance while standard ML models and most of the other DAs
cannot improve or even deteriorate the performance. Our benchmark datasets and
DA code can be freely accessed at https://github.com/Little-Cheryl/MatDA.

<h3>Modulating Spin Current Induced Effective Damping in $β-W/Py$  Heterostructures by a Systematic Variation in Resistivity of the Sputtered  Deposited $β-W$ films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02939" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02939</a>

<br>
<br>
Utilizing the spin-induced pumping from a ferromagnet (FM) into a heavy metal
(HM) under the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) condition, we report an
enhancement in effective damping in $\beta$- W/Py bilayers by systematically
varying resistivity ($\rho_{W}$) of $\beta$-W films. Different resistivity
ranging from 100 $\mu\Omega$-cm to 1400 $\mu\Omega$-cm with a thickness of 8 nm
can be achieved by varying the argon pressure ($P_{Ar}$) during the growth by
the method of sputtering. The coefficient of effective damping $\alpha_{eff}$
is observed to increase from 0.010 to 0.025 with $\rho_{W}$, which can be
modulated by $P_{Ar}$. We observe a modest dependence of $\alpha_{eff}$ on the
sputtering power ($p_{S}$) while keeping the $P_{Ar}$ constant. $\alpha_{eff}$
dependence on both $P_{Ar}$ and $p_{S}$ suggests that there exists a strong
correlation between $\alpha_{eff}$ and $\rho_{W}$. It is thus possible to
utilize $\rho_{W}$ as a tuning parameter to regulate the $\alpha_{eff}$, which
can be advantageous for faster magnetization dynamics switching. The thickness
dependence study of Py in the aforementioned bilayers manifests a higher spin
mixing conductance ($g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{eff}$) which suggests a strong
spin pumping from Py into the $\beta$-W layer. The effective spin current
($J_{S(eff)}$) is also evaluated by considering the spin-back flow in this
process. Intrinsic spin mixing conductance ($g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{W}$) and
spin diffusion length ($\lambda_{SD}$) of $\beta$-W are additionally
investigated using thickness variations in $\beta$-W. Furthermore, the
low-temperature study in $\beta$-W/Py reveals an intriguing temperature
dependence in $\alpha_{eff}$ which is quite different from $\alpha_{b}$ of
single Py layer and the enhancement in $\alpha_{eff}$ at low temperature can be
attributed to the spin-induced pumping from Py layer into $\beta$-W.

Colloidal crystals are used to understand fundamentals of atomic
rearrangements in condensed matter and build complex metamaterials with unique
functionalities. Simulations predict a multitude of self-assembled crystal
structures from anisotropic colloids, but these shapes have been challenging to
fabricate. Here, we use two-photon lithography to fabricate Archimedean
truncated tetrahedrons and self-assemble them under quasi-2D confinement. Under
a small gravitational potential, these particles self-assemble into a hexatic
phase, which has not yet been observed or reported for this shape. Under
additional gravitational potential, the hexatic phase transitions into a
quasi-diamond two-unit basis. In-situ imaging reveal this phase transition is
initiated by an out-of-plane rotation of a particle at a crystalline defect and
causes a chain reaction of neighboring particle rotations. Our results provide
a framework of studying different structures from hard-particle self-assembly
and demonstrates the ability to use confinement to induce unusual phases.

<br>
High-temperature superconductivity has been observed in binary hydrides such
as LaH10 at pressures above 150 GPa. Hydrogen cage structures have been
identified as a common motif beneficial for high critical temperatures Tc.
Efforts are now focused on finding hydride high-temperature superconductors at
lower pressures. We present evidence for high-temperature superconductivity in
binary La4H23 with A15-type structure featuring hydrogen cages at a pressure of
P = 95 GPa. We synthesise La4H23 from a lanthanum film capped with a palladium
catalyst promoting the dissociation of hydrogen. In resistance measurements, we
observe superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc = 90 K. In X-ray
diffraction on the same sample, we identify the A15-type cubic body centred
structure of the lanthanum sublattice. From comparison with earlier XRD and
structure prediction studies, we identify this phase with La4H23. Our study
reinforces the concept of hydrogen cages for high-temperature
superconductivity.

<h3>Maximally-Localized Exciton Wannier Functions for Solids</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonah B. Haber, Diana Y. Qiu, Felipe H. da Jornada, Jeffrey B. Neaton</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a maximally-localized Wannier function representation of Bloch
excitons, two-particle correlated electron-hole excitations, in crystalline
solids, where the excitons are maximally-localized with respect to an average
electron-hole coordinate in real space. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate
this representation in the case of low-energy spin-singlet and triplet excitons
in LiF, computed using the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We
visualize the resulting maximally-localized exciton Wannier functions (MLXWFs)
in real space, detail the convergence of the exciton Wannier spreads, and
demonstrate how Wannier-Fourier interpolation can be leveraged to obtain
exciton energies and states at arbitrary exciton crystal momenta in the
Brillouin zone. We further introduce an approach to treat the long-range
dipolar coupling between singlet MLXWFs and discuss it in depth. The MLXWF
representation sheds light on the fundamental nature of excitons and paves the
way towards Wannier-based post-processing of excitonic properties, enabling the
construction of ab initio exciton tight-binding models, efficient interpolation
of the exciton-phonon vertex, the computation of Berry curvature associated
with exciton bands, and beyond.

<br>
<br>
We present a comprehensive study of Wigner crystals across a broad range of
filling factors for system sizes up to 162 holes employing Hartree-Fock theory
and explicitly correlated wave function approaches. While we find broad
agreement with the behavior observed in experiments and classical Monte Carlo
simulations, we highlight the fact that the Hartree-Fock energy landscape
appears to be remarkably complex, with many competing states, both ordered and
disordered, separated by energies of a fraction of $\sim$ 1 meV/hole. We
explicitly demonstrate that these states are truly metastable by performing a
stability analysis at the Hartree-Fock level. Correlated wave function methods
reveal correlation energies that are very small, but are large enough to tip
the balance of state ordering found at the Hartree-Fock level.

<h3>Excitons in layered metal halide perovskites: an effective mass  description of polaronic, dielectric and quantum confinement effects</h3>

<br>
<i>Jose L. Movilla, Josep Planelles, Juan I. Climente</i>
<br>
<br>
A theoretical model for excitons confined in layered metal halide perovskites
is presented. The model accounts for polaronic effects, dielectric and quantum
confinement by means of effective mass theory, image charges and Haken
potentials. We use it to describe the band edge exciton of MAPbI$_3$ structures
surrounded by organic ligands. It is shown that the quasi-2D quantum and
dielectric confinement of layered perovskites squeezes the exciton radius, and
this in turn enhances polaronic effects as compared to 3D structures. The
strong polaronic effects boost the binding energies and radiative recombination
probabilities, which allows one to match experimental data in related systems.
The thickness dependence of Coulomb polarization and self-energy potentials is
in fair agreement with sophisticated atomistic models.

<br>
<br>
Metal halide perovskites are a promising class of materials for semiconductor
spintronics. Here we report a systematic investigation of coherent spin
precession, spin dephasing and spin relaxation of electrons and holes in two
hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites MA0.3FA0.7PbI3 and MA0.3FA0.7Pb0.5Sn0.5I3
using time-resolved Faraday rotation spectroscopy. With applied in-plane
magnetic fields, we observe robust Larmor spin precession of electrons and
holes that persists hundreds of picoseconds. The spin dephasing and relaxation
processes are likely sensitive to the defect levels. Temperature-dependent
measurements give further insights into the spin relaxation channels. The
extracted electron Land\'e g-factors (3.75 and 4.36) are the biggest among the
reported values in inorganic or hybrid perovskites. Both the electron and hole
g-factors shift dramatically with the temperature, which we propose to
originate from thermal lattice vibration effects on the band structure. These
results lay the foundation for further design and use of lead- and tin-based
perovskites for spintronic applications.

<h3>Non-Fermi Liquid Behavior of the $t$-$J$ Model in the Strange Metal  Phase: $U(1)$ Gauge Theory with Local Constraints</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03074" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03074</a>
<br>
<i>Xi Luo, Long Liang, Yue Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
We use the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) method to quantize the $t$-$J$
model in the $U(1)$ gauge slave boson representation. While the temporal
component of the gauge field plays a role of a Lagrange multiplier to enforce
the no double occupancy constraint, the spatial components do that to enforce
the zero counterflow constraint of the spinon and holon currents. The BRST
quantization guarantees the gauge invariance of the theory and removes the
redundant gauge degrees of freedom by proper gauge fixing conditions while the
no double occupancy and zero counterflow constraints are exactly retained.
Furthermore, Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field
with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly
coupled slave boson model, most of whose physical observables can be calculated
by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation theory. We focus on the
properties of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron
momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and their
non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy measurements for the cuprate materials. We also study the
responses of the strange metal state to the external electromagnetic fields.
The non-Fermi liquid anomalies observed in cuprates are captured by our
calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as
temperature raises and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to
positive when the dopant concentration varies from the optimal doping one to
underdoping one when the temperature $T>T^*$.

<h3>Quasiparticle Andreev reflection in the Laughlin fractions of the  fractional quantum Hall effect</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Andreev reflection occurs in a normal metal-superconductor junction, when an
electron on the normal side can only be transmitted as a Cooper pair in the
superconductor, with the reflection of a hole on the normal side. A similar
phenomenon can occur in strongly correlated systems, in particular in the
fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), as the system quasiparticles have a
charge $e/m$ different from the electron charge. We study theoretically a setup
involving two quantum point contacts (QPC) in the FQHE where Andreev reflection
occurs, as charges $e/m$ impinging on the second QPC can only be transmitted as
charges $e$, with the reflection of holes of charge $e (1-m)/m $. Using the
bosonization formalism, and out-of-equilibrium Keldysh Green function
techniques, we provide a full analytical calculation of the current
correlations at the outputs of the QPC, both at zero and finite temperature.
The ratio between the auto- and cross-correlations of the output currents is a
direct manifestation of Andreev reflection. Our results agree with recent
experimental observations, and give precious information on the temperature
dependence of this ratio.

<h3>Ferromagnetic half levitation of LK-99-like synthetic samples</h3>

<i>Kaizhen Guo, Yuan Li, Shuang Jia</i>
<br>
<br>
We successfully synthesized polycrystalline LK-99-like ceramic samples with a
solid-state-sintering method. Powder X-ray diffraction shows that the main
contents are $\mathrm{Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O}$ and $\mathrm{Cu_2S}$, consistent
with recent reports [arXiv:2307.12037; arXiv:2308.01192]. In some small flaky
fragments, we successfully observed ``half levitation'' atop a
$\mathrm{Nd_2Fe_{14}B}$ magnet. Using magnetization measurements on such small
pieces, as well as on a large piece which does not exhibit the half levitation,
we show that the samples ubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft
ferromagnetic components. We argue that, together with the pronounced shape
anisotropy of the small fragments, the soft ferromagnetism is sufficient to
explain the observed half levitation in strong vertical magnetic fields. Our
measurements do not indicate the presence of the Meissner effect, nor zero
resistance, in our samples, leading us to believe that our samples do not
exhibit superconductivity.

<h3>Anatomy of spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals</h3>

The spin Hall effect in nonmagnetic materials has been intensively studied
and became one of the most crucial spin-charge conversion mechanism in
spintronics. However, the spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals has been
less investigated and remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the spin
Hall effect in representative ferromagnetic alloy by using first-principles
calculations. We first clarify the spin Hall effect into three different types
including conventional (CSHE), spin anomalous (SAHE) and magnetic spin Hall
effect (MSHE) and then calculate the corresponding spin Hall conductivity and
spin Hall angle for (Fe, Co, Ni)Pt, NiFe and CoFe alloy. We find the above
three spin Hall mechanisms do coexist in ferromagnetic metals. Particularly,
for Pt-based ferromagnetic alloy, a sizable conventional and magnetic spin Hall
angles comparable to that of Pt have been predicted. The remarkable
unconventional spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metal may enrich the
spin-charge conversion phenomena. For instance, the spin current generated by
remarkable MSHE with out-of-plane spin-polarization should be helpful for
field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization through spin-orbit torque
effect. This work may stimulate future studies on the spin Hall effect in
ferromagnetic metals and pave their promising applications for spin-charge
conversion devices in spintronics.

<br>
Classical models of spin-lattice coupling are at present unable to accurately
reproduce results for numerous properties of ferromagnetic materials, such as
heat transport coefficients or the sudden collapse of the magnetic moment in
hcp-Fe under pressure. This inability has been attributed to the absence of a
proper treatment of effects that are inherently quantum mechanical in nature,
notably spin-orbit coupling. This paper introduces a time-dependent,
non-collinear tight binding model, complete with spin-orbit coupling and vector
Stoner exchange terms, that is capable of simulating the Einstein-de Haas
effect in a ferromagnetic $\textrm{Fe}_{15}$ cluster. The tight binding model
is used to investigate the adiabaticity timescales that determine the response
of the orbital and spin angular momenta to a rotating, externally applied $B$
field, and we show that the qualitative behaviours of our simulations can be
extrapolated to realistic timescales by use of the adiabatic theorem. An
analysis of the trends in the torque contributions with respect to the field
strength demonstrates that SOC is necessary to observe a transfer of angular
momentum from the electrons to the nuclei at experimentally realistic $B$
fields. The simulations presented in this paper demonstrate the Einstein-de
Haas effect from first principles using a Fe cluster.

<br>
<br>
There has been an increasing research focus on quantum algorithms for
condensed matter systems recently, particularly on calculating energy band
structures. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm, the powered full quantum
eigensolver(P-FQE), by using the exponentiation of operators of the full
quantum eigensolver(FQE). This leads to an exponential increase in the success
probability of measuring the target state in certain circumstances where the
number of generating elements involved in the exponentiation of operators
exhibit a log polynomial dependence on the number of orbitals. Furthermore, we
conduct numerical calculations for band structure determination of the twisted
double-layer graphene. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and
robustness of the P-FQE algorithm using superconducting quantum computers for
graphene and Weyl semimetal. One significant advantage of our algorithm is its
ability to reduce the requirements of extremely high-performance hardware,
making it more suitable for energy spectra determination on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

<br>

We explain the appearance of magic angle flat bands and fractional Chern
insulators in twisted K-valley homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides by
mapping their continuum model to a Landau level problem. Our approach relies on
an adiabatic approximation for the quantum mechanics of valence band holes in a
layer-pseudospin field that is valid for sufficiently small twist angles and on
a lowest Landau level approximation that is valid for sufficiently large twist
angles. It simply explains why the quantum geometry of the lowest moir\'e
miniband is close to ideal at the flat-band twist angle, predicts that flat
bands occur only when the valley-dependent moir\'e potential is sufficiently
strong compared to the interlayer tunneling amplitude, and provides a powerful
starting point for the study of interactions.

<h3>Superconductivity near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in the high-entropy  alloy superconductor (ScZrNb)$_{1-x}$(RhPd)$_x$ with a CsCl-type lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>Sylwia Gutowska, Alicja Kawala, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha</i>
<br>
<br>
Theoretical analysis of the electronic structure of the high-entropy-type
superconductor (ScZrNb)$_{1-x}$(RhPd)$_x$, $x \in (0.35, 0.45)$ is presented.
The studied material is a partially ordered CsCl-type structure, with two
sublattices, randomly occupied by Sc, Zr, Nb (first sublattice) and Nb, Rh, and
Pd (second sublattice). Calculations were done using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker
method with the coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and take into
account the substitutional disorder. Our total energy calculations confirm the
preference for the partially ordered structure over the fully random {\it
bcc}-type one. Electronic densities of states $N(E)$, dispersion relations, and
McMillan-Hopfield parameters $\eta$ (electronic contribution to electron-phonon
coupling) are studied as a function of composition. The computed increasing
trends in $N(E_F)$ and $\eta$ with $x$ are opposite to what we expected based
on the experimental results, where the decrease in the critical temperature
with increasing $x$ was found. Very strong electron scattering due to disorder
is observed, as the electronic dispersion relations are strongly smeared. As a
result, the computed electronic lifetimes $\tau$ are very short, leading to a
small mean-free path of electrons of the order of interatomic distance, which
puts (ScZrNb)$_{1-x}$(RhPd)$_x$ near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit. The trend in
$\tau(x)$ is similar to the trend observed experimentally in $T_c(x)$,
suggesting that disorder may be the factor that influences $T_c$ in this series
of alloys.

Incorporating plasmonic metal nanostructures into the semiconductor compounds
in the form of core-shell offers a new route to improving the performance of
photodetectors. Herein, we have reported the development of a high-performance
photodetector based on Cu2NiSnS4 (CNTS) nanocrystals (NCs) and Au/CNTS
core-shell structures (complex or others, instead NC), for the first time, as a
proof-of-concept experiment using the colloidal hot-injection method. The
photoactive Au/CNTS core-shell NCs exhibit enhanced optical absorption, carrier
extraction efficiency, and improved photo-sensing performance. It is depicted
that using this Au/CNTS core-shell/graphene-based photodetector, there is a
significant increment in optoelectronic responses compared to using a pristine
CNTS/graphene-based photodetector. The maximum responsivity, detectivity, and
external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.2 $\times 10^{3}$ AW$^{-1}$, 6.2$\times
10^{11}$ Jones, and 3.8$\times 10^{5}$ \% were measured at an illumination
power density of 318.5 $\mu$Wcm-2. Importantly, this enhanced optoelectronic
performance is mainly due to the plasmonic-induced resonance energy transfer
(PIRET) effect of core Au; carrier density is significantly increased between
the Au core and CNTS shell. Further, the device using Au/CNTS exhibits a fast
response/recovery time of 2.58/11.14 sec and excellent operational reliability.
These results enlighten a new era in the fabrication and development of
plasmonic core-shell nanostructures-based visible photo-sensing devices for

<h3>Breakdown of Chiral Edge Modes in Topological Magnon Insulators</h3>

Topological magnon insulators (TMI) are ordered magnets supporting chiral
edge magnon excitations. These edge states are envisioned to serve as
topologically protected information channels in low-loss magnonic devices. The
standard description of TMI is based on linear spin-wave theory (LSWT), which
approximates magnons as free non-interacting particles. However, magnon
excitations of TMI are genuinely interacting even at zero temperature, calling
into question descriptions based on LSWT alone. Here we perform a detailed
non-linear spin-wave analysis to investigate the stability of chiral edge
magnons. We identify three general breakdown mechanisms: (1) The edge magnon
couples to itself, generating a finite lifetime that can be large enough to
lead to a spectral annihilation of the chiral state; (2) The edge magnon
hybridizes with the extended bulk magnons and, as a consequence, delocalizes
away from the edge; (3) Due to a bulk-magnon mediated edge-to-edge coupling,
the chiral magnons at opposite edges hybridize. We argue that, in general,
these breakdown mechanisms may invalidate predictions based on LSWT and violate
the notion of topological protection. We discuss strategies how the breakdown
of chiral edge magnons can be avoided, e.g. via the application of large
magnetic fields. Our results highlight a challenge for the realization of
chiral edge states in TMI and in other bosonic topological systems without
particle number conservation.

<i>Johan Andberger, Lorenzo Graziotto, Luca Sacchi, Mattias Beck, Giacomo Scalari, Jérôme Faist</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate terahertz chiral metamaterial cavities that break
time-reversal symmetry by coupling the degenerate linearly polarized modes of
two orthogonal sets of nano-antenna arrays using the inter-Landau level
transition of a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field,
realizing normalized light-matter coupling rates up to
$\Omega_R/\omega_{\mathrm{cav}} = 0.78$. The deep sub-wavelength confinement
and gap of the nano-antennas means that the ultra-strong coupling regime can be
reached even with a very small number of carriers, making it viable to be used
with a variety of 2D materials, including graphene. In addition it possesses a
non-degenerate chiral ground state that can be used to study the effect of
circularly polarized electromagnetic quantum fluctuations by means of
weakly-perturbing magneto-transport measurements.

It was recently shown that dry active matter may form rotating vortices
around circular obstacles. However, is lacking of a systematic study in the
literature. Here, we study how two such structures interact mainly as a
function of the shortest distance between the obstacles. We find that, like the
observations of vortex formation in wet active matter, both vortices can
synchronize their rotations in either opposite or in the same direction; we
call such regimes antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, respectively. We show
that, for the antiferromagnetic case, both vortices keep their motion
correlated by exchanging particles through the region in between them,
similarly to a cog; on the other hand, for the ferromagnetic regime, the
particle exchange takes place above and below the vortices, as two opposite
particle currents appear, similarly to a belt wrapped around both and, driving
them through their edges.

Based on the first principle calculations, we investigate the geometry and
the electronic structures of the room temperature superconductor lead apatite
with and without the Cu doped. Our calculations found that without the Cu
doping the lead apatite crystal is an insulator with a flat band above the
Fermi lever. Furthermore, our results indicate that by introducing the O1
vacancies would results in the disappear of the flat bands in the undopped
crystal. While the Cu is doped forming the LK-99, there exist the ultra-flat
bands crossing the Fermi level induced by the doped Cu atoms, which is due to
the hybridization between the d states of the Cu atoms and the p states of the
fully occupied 1/4 occupied O1 atoms. Moreover, we point out that the
hybridization maybe the key for the realization of the room temperature
superconductivity for the LK-99, and a possible solutions method to improve the
quality of the superconductivity is proposed. Our work provides a foundation
for the future studies on the unique electronic and the superconductivity
properties of the LK-99 crystal.

<br>
<br>
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) moir\'e superlattices, owing to the
moir\'e flatbands and strong correlation, can host periodic electron crystals
and fascinating correlated physics. The TMDC heterojunctions in the type-II
alignment also enable long-lived interlayer excitons that are promising for
correlated bosonic states, while the interaction is dictated by the asymmetry
of the heterojunction. Here we demonstrate a new excitonic state, quadrupolar
exciton, in a symmetric WSe2-WS2-WSe2 trilayer moir\'e superlattice. The
quadrupolar excitons exhibit a quadratic dependence on the electric field,
distinctively different from the linear Stark shift of the dipolar excitons in
heterobilayers. This quadrupolar exciton stems from the hybridization of WSe2
valence moir\'e flatbands. The same mechanism also gives rise to an interlayer
Mott insulator state, in which the two WSe2 layers share one hole laterally
confined in one moir\'e unit cell. In contrast, the hole occupation probability
in each layer can be continuously tuned via an out-of-plane electric field,
reaching 100% in the top or bottom WSe2 under a large electric field,
accompanying the transition from quadrupolar excitons to dipolar excitons. Our
work demonstrates a trilayer moir\'e system as a new exciting playground for
realizing novel correlated states and engineering quantum phase transitions.

<br>
<br>
We use co-sputtering to directly synthesize thin films of the A15 phase
intermetallic compound Ta3Sb, which has been predicted to have a giant spin
Hall conductivity. We identify a large window of Ta:Sb flux ratio that
stabilizes single-phase A15 Ta3Sb. Composition analyses of these films show a
Ta:Sb atomic ratio of 4:1, which is consistent with the known Ta-Sb phase
diagram. The spin Hall conductivity of thin film Ta3Sb is -3400+/-400 (hbar/2e)
S/cm and the spin-orbit torque efficiency is -0.6+/-0.1 at 20 K, as determined
from harmonic Hall measurements of Ta3Sb/permalloy bilayer structures. These
giant values make Ta3Sb a promising material for efficient charge-to-spin
conversion in spintronic applications. Large field-like spin-orbit effective
fields that are independent of the ferromagnetic layer thickness have also been
measured in the Ta3Sb/permalloy bilayers. We attribute the field-like
spin-orbit effective field to the Rashba effect at the interface.

<br>
<br>
Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are essential components of
optoelectronic devices and various materials have been explored for highly
efficient TCOs having a combination of high transmittance and low sheet
resistance. Here, we focus on a misfit thermoelectric oxide
[Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] and fabricate the transparent low-layered
crystals by a mechanical tape-peeling method using the single-crystalline
samples. From the transmittance measurement, we find that the thickness of
low-layered samples is several orders of hundred nanometers, which is
comparable with the estimation from the scanning electron microscopy images.
Compared to the previous results on the polycrystalline and $c$-axis oriented
transparent films, the electrical resistivity is reduced owing to the
single-crystalline nature. The figure of merit for the transparent conducting
materials in the present low-layered samples is then evaluated to be higher
than the values in the previous reports. The present results on the low-layered
single-crystalline [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] may offer a unique class
of multi-functional transparent thermoelectric oxides.

<i>Srishti Pal, Arnab Seth, Anzar Ali, Yogesh Singh, D. V. S. Muthu, Subhro Bhattacharjee, A. K. Sood</i>
<br>
<br>
We report low-temperature Raman signatures of the Heisenberg quantum magnet
Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, showing clear anomalies in phonon mode frequencies and
linewidths below $\sim$100 K. This crossover temperature lies in between the
Jahn-Teller (JT) temperature scale ($>$ room temperature) and the temperature
scale associated with the spin exchange interactions ($<$ 12 K). Our
experimental observation is well captured by a novel secondary JT transition
associated with a cooperative reorientation of the orbitals giving rise to
anomalies in the temperature dependence of Raman frequencies and linewidths.
Such orbital reorganisation, in turn, affects the spin-spin exchange
interactions that decide the fate of the magnet at lower temperatures and hence
provide important clues to understand the energetics of the possible lower
temperature quantum paramagnetic phase.

<br>
<br>
We study the interaction between two charge regulating spherical macroions
with dielectric interior and dissociable surface groups immersed in a
monovalent electrolyte solution. The charge dissociation is modelled via the
Frumkin-Fowler-Guggenheim isotherm, which allows for multiple adsorption
equilibrium states. The interactions are derived from the solutions of the
mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann type theory with charge regulation boundary
conditions. For a range of conditions we find symmetry breaking transitions
from symmetric to asymmetric charge distribution exhibiting annealed charge
patchiness, which results in like-charge attraction even in a univalent
electrolyte -- thus fundamentally modifying the nature of electrostatic
interactions in charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions.

<br>
<i>Isaac Soltero, David A. Ruiz-Tijerina</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the energies and optical spectra of excitons in twisted bilayers of
anisotropic van der Waals semiconductors exhibiting moir\'e patterns, taking
phosphorene as a case study. Following the electronic Hamiltonian introduced by
us in [Phys. Rev. B 105, 235421 (2022)], and leveraging the scale separation
between the moir\'e lengthscale and the exciton Bohr radii, we introduce a
continuous model for excitons that incorporates the spatial variation of their
binding energies. Our zone-folding calculations reveal a dimensionality
crossover for the exciton states, driven by the combined dispersion- and
moir\'e potential anisotropies, from quantum-dot-like (0D) lattices at twist
angles $\theta<\theta_*$, to quantum-wire-like (1D) arrays at
$\theta>\theta_*$, with crossover angle $\theta_*=4^\circ$. We identify clear
signatures of this dimensionality crossover in the twist angle dependence of
the excitonic absorption spectra, which allows experimental verification of our
theoretical results through standard optical measurements. Our results
establish two-dimensional anisotropic moir\'e semiconductors as versatile
solid-state platforms for exploring bosonic correlations across different
dimensionalities.

We derive exciton-spin interactions from a microscopic correlated model that
captures important aspects of the physics of charge-transfer (CT) insulators to
address magnetism associated with exciton creation. We present a minimal model
consisting of coupled clusters of transition metal d and ligand p orbitals that
captures the essential features of the local atomic and electronic structure.
First, we identify the lowest-energy state and optically allowed excited states
within a cluster by applying the molecular orbital picture to the ligand p
orbitals. Then, we derive the effective interactions between two clusters
mediated by intercluster hoppings, which include exciton-spin couplings. The
interplay of the correlations and the spatial structure of the CT exciton leads
to strong magnetic exchange couplings with spatial anisotropy. Finally, we
calculate an optical excitation spectrum in our effective model to obtain
insights into magnetic sidebands optically observed in magnetic materials. We
demonstrate that the spin-flip excitation due to the strongly enhanced local
spin interactions around the exciton gives rise to the magnetic sidebands.

<br>
<br>
Physical vapor high-temperature deposition of CdTe thin films is one of the
main methods for preparing high-efficiency CdTe solar cells, but
high-temperature deposition also has an impact on the internal structure of the
film. The difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the substrate
and CdTe leads to the generation of internal stress in the CdTe thin film
during the cooling process. In this work, we prepared thin films with different
substrate temperatures using a homemade GVD device, and observed by SEM that
the crystallization quality of the film gradually improved with the increase of
substrate temperature, but accompanied by the shift of XRD peak position. We
calculated the internal stress situation of the film by the shift amount, and
the possible causes of stress generation were speculated by the results of TEM
and SAED to be the combined effects of the different thermal expansion
coefficients between the substrate and the film and the stacking fault defects
inside the film.

We demonstrate that parametrically excited eigenmodes in nearby nanomagnets
can be coupled to each other. Both positive (in-phase) and negative
(anti-phase) couplings can be realized by a combination of appropriately chosen
geometry and excitation field frequency. The oscillations are sufficiently
stable against thermal fluctuations. The phase relation between field-coupled
nanomagnets shows a hysteretic behavior with the phase relation being locked
over a wide frequency range. We envision that this computational study lays the
groundwork to use field-coupled nanomagnets as parametrons as building blocks
of logic devices, neuromorphic systems or Ising machines.

We introduce a supersymmetric lattice fermion model that contains both
fermion pairing and the interacting Nicolai model. This model possesses a
single control parameter, $g$, introduced through the anticommutator of the
supersymmetry generators (supercharge), and it is shown that supersymmetry is
broken in both finite and infinite systems as long as $g$ is finite.
Additionally, the single-mode approximation is employed to establish an upper
bound on the dispersion relation of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermions,
demonstrating their gaplessness. Finally, it is shown, through numerical and
analytic calculations, that the anticipated extensive ground-state degeneracy
and a zero-energy flat band does not occur for generic values of the parameter
$g$.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate indirect electric-field control of ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) in devices that integrate the low-loss, molecule-based, room-temperature
ferrimagnet vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]$_{x \sim 2}$) mechanically
coupled to PMN-PT piezoelectric transducers. Upon straining the V[TCNE]$_x$
films, the FMR frequency is tuned by more than 6 times the resonant linewidth
with no change in Gilbert damping for samples with $\alpha = 6.5 \times
10^{-5}$. We show this tuning effect is due to a strain-dependent magnetic
anisotropy in the films and find the magnetoelastic coefficient $|\lambda_S|
\sim (1 - 4.4)$ ppm, backed by theoretical predictions from DFT calculations
and magnetoelastic theory. Noting the rapidly expanding application space for
strain-tuned FMR, we define a new metric for magnetostrictive materials,
$\textit{magnetostrictive agility}$, given by the ratio of the magnetoelastic
coefficient to the FMR linewidth. This agility allows for a direct comparison
between magnetostrictive materials in terms of their comparative efficacy for
magnetoelectric applications requiring ultra-low loss magnetic resonance
modulated by strain. With this metric, we show V[TCNE]$_x$ is competitive with
other magnetostrictive materials including YIG and Terfenol-D. This combination
of ultra-narrow linewidth and magnetostriction in a system that can be directly
integrated into functional devices without requiring heterogeneous integration
in a thin-film geometry promises unprecedented functionality for electric-field
tuned microwave devices ranging from low-power, compact filters and circulators
to emerging applications in quantum information science and technology.

The second law of thermodynamics posits that in closed macroscopic systems
the rate of entropy production must be positive. However, small systems can
exhibit negative entropy production over short timescales, seemingly in
contradiction with this law. The fluctuation theorem quantitatively connects
these two limits, predicting that entropy producing trajectories become
exponentially dominant as the system size and measurement time are increased.
Here we explore the predictions of the fluctuation theorem for a fluid of
point-vortices, where the long-range interactions and existence of negative
absolute temperature states provide an intriguing test bed for the theorem. Our
results suggest that while the theorem broadly holds even at negative absolute
temperatures, the long-range interactions inherent to the vortex matter lead to
anomalously large entropy production over short time intervals. The predictions
of the fluctuation theorem are only fully recovered when sufficient noise is
introduced to the dynamics to overwhelm the vortex-vortex interactions.

The Cu-$3d$ states in the high-$T_c$ cuprates are often described as a single
band of $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, with the other four $3d$ states having about 2
to 3 eV higher energy due to the lower-than-octahedral crystal field at the
copper sites. However, excitations to these higher energy states observed with
RIXS show indications of strong coupling to doped holes in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$
band. This relaunches a decades-old question of the possible role of the
orbital degrees of freedom that once motivated Bednorz and M\"uller to search
for superconductivity in these systems. Here we explore a direction different
from the Jahn-Teller electron-phonon coupling considered by Bednorz and
M\"uller, namely the interaction between holes mediated by $dd$ excitations.

Hydrogen is a crucial source of green energy and has been extensively studied
for its potential usage in fuel cells. The advent of two-dimensional crystals
(2DCs) has taken hydrogen research to new heights, enabling it to tunnel
through layers of 2DCs or be transported within voids between the layers, as
demonstrated in recent experiments by Geim's group. In this study, we
investigate how the composition and stacking of transition-metal dichalcogenide
(TMDC) layers influence the transport and self-diffusion coefficients (D) of
hydrogen atoms using well-tempered metadynamics simulations. Our findings show
that modifying either the transition metal or the chalcogen atoms significantly
affects the free energy barriers (Delta F) and, consequently, the
self-diffusion of hydrogen atoms between the 2DC layers. In the Hh polytype (2H
stacking), MoSe2 exhibits the lowest Delta F, while WS2 has the highest,
resulting in the largest D for the former system. Additionally, hydrogen atoms
inside the RhM (or 3R) polytype encounter more than twice lower energy barriers
and, thus, much higher diffusivity compared to those within the most stable Hh
stacking. These findings are particularly significant when investigating
twisted layers or homo- or heterostructures, as different stacking areas may
dominate over others, potentially leading to directional transport and
interesting materials for ion or atom sieving.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the quantum transport of the heat and the charge through a
quantum dot (QD) coupled to fermionic contacts under the influence of time
modulation of temperatures. We derive within the nonequilibrium Keldysh Green's
function (NEGF) formalism, exact formulas for the charge, heat currents and the
dissipation power by employing the concept of gravitational field firstly
introduced by Luttinger in the sixties. The gravitational field, entering into
the system Hamiltonian and being coupled to the energies stored in the
contacts, plays a similar role as the electrostatic potential that is coupled
to the charge density. We extend the original idea of Luttinger to correctly
handle the dynamical transport driven under a time-modulated (ac) temperature,
by coupling the gravitational field to not only the contact energy but also to
half of the energy stored in the tunneling barriers connecting the QD to the
contacts. The validity of our formalism is supported in that it satisfies the
Onsager reciprocity relations and also reproduces the dynamics obtained from
the scattering theory for noninteracting cases. Our formalism provides a
systematical procedure to obtain general expressions for the charge and heat
currents in the linear response regime solely in terms of the retarded and
advanced components of the interacting QD NEGFs by a help of the charge
conservation and some sum rules. In order to demonstrate the utility of our
formalism, we apply it to the noninteracting and interacting QD junctions and
interpret the charge and heat transports in terms of the equivalent quantum RC
circuits. Via a systematic consideration of the effect of the Coulomb
interaction under the ac drive of temperature, our formalism reveals that the
interaction can modify the response for charging and energy relaxation with a
significant different temperature dependence.

Two-dimensional (2D) half-metallic materials are highly desirable for
nanoscale spintronic applications. Here, we propose a new mechanism that can
achieve half-metallicity in 2D ferromagnetic (FM) material with two-layer
magnetic atoms by electric field tuning. We use a concrete example of
experimentally synthesized CrSBr monolayer to illustrate our proposal through
the first-principle calculations. It is found that the half-metal can be
achieved in CrSBr within appropriate electric field range, and the
corresponding amplitude of electric field intensity is available in experiment.
Janus monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2S_2BrI}$ is constructed, which possesses built-in
electric field due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry. However,
$\mathrm{Cr_2S_2BrI}$ without and with applied external electric field is
always a FM semiconductor. A possible memory device is also proposed based on
CrSBr monolayer. Our works will stimulate the application of 2D FM CrSBr in
future spintronic nanodevices.

<br>
<br>
Shape asymmetry is the most abundant in nature and attracted great interest
in recent research. It is well known that a free ellipsoidal Brownian particle
exhibits anisotropic diffusion for short times which changes to isotropic at
long times. We have further expanded this concept to incorporate active
ellipsoidal particles characterized by an initial self-propelled velocity. In
our previous study\cite{ghosh2022persistence}, we derived the analytical
expressions and simulation results of the persistence probability of an active
anisotropic particle without any external potential and with an external
harmonic potential. This paper provides analytical and simulation results of
diffusion coefficients of an active ellipsoidal particle. In comparison to a
passive particle, we demonstrate that the long-term diffusion coefficient of an
active particle is influenced by both the magnitude of the propulsion velocity
and the rotational diffusion coefficient. We have also studied the
approximations of different results for diffusion coefficients in $t\ll
D_\theta^{-1}$ time-scale. We investigated diffusion dynamics for the free
particle as well as the particle in a harmonic trap, and the particle subject
to a constant field force. Additionally, we have studied the scaled average
velocity of an ellipsoidal active particle in different force fields. Using
analytical methods, we demonstrate that the presence of external forces leads
to a modification of the long-time diffusion coefficient compared to that of a
free particle.

<br>
An electronic structure and magnetic properties analysis of the recently
proposed Cu-doped lead apatite is performed. We confirm that electronic
structures of differently Cu-substituted structures are characterized by
localized molecular Cu-O bands at or near the Fermi level. The Cu substitutions
can happen at both Pb1 and Pb2 sites, leading to metallic and semiconducting
states differently. The electronic states in these bands are highly unstable
magnetically and form clusters of rigidly ferromagnetically coupled magnetic
moments on Cu and neighboring oxygen atoms with a total moment of about 1
$\mu$B. Our calculations revealed the absence of the long-range magnetic order
between these Cu-O clusters, creating the spin glass type of system. The
inclusion of quantum spin fluctuations confirms the stability of such magnetic
Cu-O clusters.

Description of the total energy of a many-electron system, $E$, as a function
of the total number of electrons $N_\textrm{tot}$ (integer or fractional) is of
great importance in atomic and molecular physics, theoretical chemistry and
materials science. Equally significant is the correct dependence of the energy
on the spin of the system, $S_\textrm{tot}$. In this Letter we extend previous
work, allowing both $N_\textrm{tot}$ and $S_\textrm{tot}$ to vary continuously,
taking on both integer and fractional values, rigorously considering systems
with arbitrary values of $N_\textrm{tot}$ and of the equilibrium spin. We
describe the ground state of a finite, many-electron system by an ensemble of
pure states, and characterize the dependence of the energy and the
spin-densities on both $N_\textrm{tot}$ and $S_\textrm{tot}$. Our findings
generalize the piecewise-linearity principle of Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 1691
(1982) and the flat-plane condition of Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 066403 (2009). We
find that the ensemble ground state consists of four pure states at most,
provided that the absolute value of the spin is smaller or equal to its
equilibrium value, for a given $N_\textrm{tot}$. As a result, a degeneracy in
the ensemble ground-state occurs, such that the total energy and the density
are unique, but the spin-densities are not. Moreover, we find a new type of a
derivative discontinuity, which manifests in the case of spin variation at
constant $N_\textrm{tot}$, as a jump in the Kohn-Sham potential at the edges of
the variation range. Our findings serve as a basis for development of advanced
approximations in density functional theory and other many-electron methods.

<h3>How to enhance anomalous Hall effects in magnetic Weyl semimetal  Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$?</h3>

Large spin-orbit coupling, kagome lattice, nontrivial topological band
structure with inverted bands anti-crossings, and Weyl nodes are essential
ingredients, ideally required to obtain maximal anomalous Hall effect (AHE) are
simultaneously present in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. It is a leading platform to show
large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and giant anomalous Hall
angle (AHA) simultaneously at low fields. The giant AHE in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is
robust against small-scale doping-related chemical potential changes. In this
work, we unveil a selective and co-chemical doping route to maximize AHEs in
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. To begin with, in Co$_3$Sn$_{2-x}$In$_x$S$_2$, we brought
the chemical potential at the hotspot of Berry curvature along with a maximum
of asymmetric impurity scattering in high mobility region. As a result at
x=0.05, we found a significant enhancement of AHA (95%) and AHC (190%) from the
synergistic enhancement of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms from modified
Berry curvature of gaped nodal lines. Later, with anticipation of further
improvements in AHE, we grew hole-co-doped
Co$_{3-y}$Fe$_y$Sn$_{2-x}$In$_x$S$_2$ crystals, where we found rather a
suppression of AHEs. The role of dopants in giving extrinsic effects or band
broadening can be better understood when chemical potential does not change
after doping. By simultaneous and equal co-doping with electrons and holes in
Co$_{3-y-z}$Fe$_y$Ni$_z$Sn$_2$S$_2$, we kept the chemical potential unchanged.
Henceforth, we found a significant enhancement in intrinsic AHC $\sim$116% due
to the disorder broadenings in kagome bands

Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and
it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong
technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of high
dimensional integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network
techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these
technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into
``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, the exact hydrogenoid
atomic orbitals and orbitals for chemical bonds. Our method provides a path for
building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been
accessible with previous technology.

Realization of non-Abelian anyons in topological phases is a crucial step
toward topological quantum computation. We propose a scheme to realize a
non-Abelian quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in a three-component Bose gas with
contact interaction on optical Kagome lattices. In the strong coupling regime,
the system is described by an effective spin-1 model with two- and three-body
interactions between neighboring spins. By mapping out the phase diagram via
variational Monte Carlo method, we find a non-Abelian chiral spin liquid phase
in which the Ising-type anyons obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. The
gapless chiral edge states can be detected by measuring the spin-spin
correlation from atomic population. Furthermore, an interesting Z2 QSL phase is
observed exhibiting both topological order and lattice symmetry breaking order.
Our scheme can be implemented in cold quantum gases of bosonic atoms.

<br>
<br>
The rheology of molecular brushes remains challenging to control due to the
multiple length scales and relaxation processes involved and the lack of direct
observation of molecular conformation during flow. We use molecular dynamics
simulations to determine the shear thinning of unentangled bottlebrush polymers
with varying architecture, from linear chains to combs, to densely grafted
bottlebrushes, to star-like and star polymers. We find shear thinning exponents
in line with theoretical and experimental results and characterize the shape
and orientation of bottlebrushes in steady-state flow. Many shape parameters
derived from the gyration tensor show molecular alignment with the flow for all
systems. Yet, the orientation of individual bonds is what most strongly
correlates with the architecture-dependent shear-thinning exponents. In densely
grafted bottlebrushes, the packing of side chains prevents alignment with the
flow, causing a reduction in shear thinning. The molecular insight from our
simulations is useful to tune the architecture of bottlebrushes to control
their rheology.

<br>
<br>
Porous electrodes were developed using laser powder bed fusion of Inconel 718
lattice structures and electrodeposition of a porous nickel catalytic layer.
Laser energy densities of 83-333 J/m were used to fabricate 500 um thick
electrodes made of body centered cubic unit cells of 200-500 um and strut
thicknesses of 100-200 um. Unit cells of 500 um and strut thickness of 200 um
were identified as optimum. Despite small changes in feature sizes by the
energy input, the porosity of more than 50 percent and pore size of 100 um did
not change. Nickel electrodeposition created a network of submicrometer pores.
The electrodes' electrochemical efficiency was assessed by analysing
hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) in a three-electrode setup. For
HER, a much larger maximum current density of -372 mA/cm2 at a less negative
potential of -0.4 V vs RHE (potential against reversible hydrogen electrode)
was produced in the nickel-coated samples, as compared to -240 mA/cm2 at -0.6 V
in the bare one, indicating superior performance of the coated sample. For OER,
however, both bare and nickel-coated electrodes similarly showed a maximum
current density of 350 mA/cm2 at 1.8 V vs RHE due to performance trade-offs
arising from sample composition and structure.

The report of synthesis of modified Lead apatite (LK-99) with evidence of
superconductivity at more than boiling water temperature has steered the whole
scientific community. There have been several failures to reproduce
superconductivity in LK-99 including partial successes. Here, we have continued
our efforts to synthesize phase pure LK-99 with improved precursors. The
process has been followed as suggested by Sukbae Lee et. al., [1,2]. The phase
purity of each precursor is evidenced by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and
well fitted by Rietveld refinement. The PXRD confirms the synthesis of phase
pure polycrystalline LK-99 with apatite structure. The freshly synthesized
sample does not show any signature of superconductivity levitation on a magnet
(diamagnetism). The magnetization measurements on SQUID also show that LK-99 is
diamagnetic at 280 K, there is no sign of superconductivity in LK-99 at room
temperature. Moreover, we have also performed first principle calculations to
investigate the electronic band structure of the LK-99 near Fermi level. Our
study verifies that the Cu doped lead apatite (LK-99) has bands crossing at
Fermi level, indicating generation of strong correlation in the system.

Starting from Halperin multilayer systems we develop a hierarchical scheme
that generates, bosonic and fermionic, single-layer quantum Hall states (or
vacua) of arbitrary filling factor. Our scheme allows for the insertion of
quasiparticle excitations with either Abelian or non-Abelian statistics and
quantum numbers that depend on the nature of the original vacuum. Most
importantly, it reveals a fusion mechanism for quasielectrons and
magnetoexcitons that generalizes ideas about particle fractionalization
introduced in Commun. Phys. 5, 171 (2022) for the case of Laughlin fluids. In
addition, in the second quantization representation, we uncover the inherent
topological quantum order characterizing these vacua. In particular, we
illustrate the methodology by constructing generalized composite (generalized
Read) operators for the non-Abelian Pfaffian and Hafnian quantum fluid states.

Expanding the library of self-assembled superstructures provides insight into
the behavior of atomic crystals and supports the development of materials with
mesoscale order. Here we build upon recent findings of soft matter
quasicrystals and report a quasicrystalline binary nanocrystal superlattice
that exhibits correlations in the form of partial matching rules reducing
tiling disorder. We determine a three-dimensional structure model through
electron tomography and direct imaging of surface topography. The 12-fold
rotational symmetry of the quasicrystal is broken in sub-layers, forming a
random tiling of rectangles, large triangles, and small triangles with 6-fold
symmetry. We analyze the geometry of the experimental tiling and discuss
factors relevant for the stabilization of the quasicrystal. Our joint
experimental-computational study demonstrates the power of nanocrystal
superlattice engineering and further narrows the gap between the richness of
crystal structures found with atoms and in soft matter assemblies.

<h3>Phase separation in tilings of a bounded region of the plane</h3>

Given a finite set of two-dimensional tile types, the field concerned with
covering the plane with tiles of these types only has a long history, having
enjoyed great prominence in the last six to seven decades, not only as a topic
of recreational mathematics but mainly as a topic of scientific interest. Much
of this interest has revolved around fundamental geometrical problems such as
minimizing the variety of tile types to be used, and also around important
applications in areas such as crystallography and others concerned with various
atomic- and molecular-scale phenomena. All applications are of course confined
to finite regions, but in many cases they refer back directly to progress in
tiling the whole plane. Tilings of bounded regions of the plane have also been
actively studied, but in general the additional complications imposed by the
boundary conditions tend to constrain progress to mostly indirect results, such
as recurrence relations. Here we study the tiling of rectangular regions of the
plane by squares, dominoes, and straight tetraminoes. For this set of tile
types, not even recurrence relations seem to be available. Our approach is to
seek to characterize this system through some of the fundamental quantities of
statistical physics. We do this on two parallel tracks, one fully analytical
for a special case, the other based on the Wang-Landau method for state-density
estimation. Given a simple Hamiltonian based solely on tile contacts, we have
found either approach to lead to illuminating depictions of entropy,
temperature, and above all phase separation. The notion of phase separation, in
this context, refers to keeping track of how many tiles of each type are used
in each of the many possibilities. We have found that this helps bind together
different aspects of the system in question and conjecture that future
applications will benefit from the possibilities it affords.

<h3>Oxide layer formation prevents deteriorating ion migration in  thermoelectric Cu$_2$Se during operation in air</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cu$_2$Se is a mixed ionic-electronic conductor with outstanding
thermoelectric performance originally envisioned for space missions.
Applications were discontinued due to material instability, where elemental Cu
grows at the electrode interfaces during operation in vacuum. Here, we show
that when Cu$_2$Se is operating in air, formation of an oxide surface layer
suppresses Cu$^+$ migration along the current direction. In operando X-ray
scattering and electrical resistivity measurements quantify Cu$^+$ migration
through refinement of atomic occupancies and phase composition analysis. Cu
deposition can be prevented during operation in air, irrespective of a critical
voltage, if the thermal gradient is applied along the current direction.
Maximum entropy electron density analysis provides experimental evidence that
Cu$^+$ migration pathways under thermal and electrical gradients differ
substantially from equilibrium diffusion. The study establishes new promise for
inexpensive sustainable Cu$_2$Se in thermoelectric applications, and it
underscores the importance of atomistic insight into materials during
thermoelectric operating conditions.

We study the appearance of first-order dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) as
`intermittent' co-existing phases in the fluctuations of random walks on
graphs. We show that the diverging time scale leading to critical behaviour is
the waiting time to jump from one phase to another. This time scale is crucial
for observing the system's relaxation to stationarity and demonstrate
ergodicity of the system at criticality. We illustrate these results through
three analytical examples which provide insights into random walks exploring
random graphs.

<br>
<br>
Capitalizing on recent work, that clarifies the consistent use of
bosonization-debosonization methods to study Kondo-type quantum impurity models
even in non-equilibrium settings, we revisit the compactification procedure of
the two-channel Kondo model (by which it is rewritten more compactly using the
single-channel version of the model and exploiting separation and duality
between spin and charge) and uncover some hidden approximations that could
limit its range of validity. This complements and extends, for two or any even
number of channels, beyond previous work on the Toulouse limit of these models,
and reinforces the need for the use of an extended framework in these
calculations. We carry out a number of exact comparisons between the different
models, and show that keeping track of the, so called, consistency factors
leads to full agreement between the compactified and original version of the
model.

Thin layers of orthorhombic uranium ({\alpha}-U) have been grown onto
buffered sapphire substrates by d.c. magnetron sputtering, resulting in the
discovery of new epitaxial matches to Ti(00.1) and Zr(00.1) surfaces. These
systems have been characterised by X-ray diffraction and reflectivity and the
optimal deposition temperatures have been determined. More advanced structural
characterisation of the known Nb(110) and W(110) buffered {\alpha}-U systems
has also been carried out, showing that past reports of the domain structures
of the U layers are incomplete. The ability of this low symmetry structure to
form crystalline matches across a range of crystallographic templates
highlights the complexity of U metal epitaxy and points naturally toward
studies of the low temperature electronic properties of {\alpha}-U as a
function of epitaxial strain.

The presence of electron correlations in a system with topological order can
lead to exotic ground states. Considering single crystals of LaAgSb2 which has
a square net crystal structure, one finds multiple charge density wave
transitions (CDW) as the temperature is lowered. We find large planar Hall
(PHE) signals in the CDW phase, which are still finite in the high temperature
phase though they change sign. Optimising the structure within first-principles
calculations, one finds an unusual chiral metallic phase. This is because as
the temperature is lowered, the separation between the Ag/Sb atoms on different
layers decreases, leading to stronger repulsions between electrons associated
with atoms on different layers. This leads to successive layers sliding with
respect to each other, thereby stabilising a chiral structure in which
inversion symmetry is also broken. The large Berry curvature associated with
the low-temperature structure explains the low temperature PHE. At high
temperature, the PHE arises from the changes induced in the anisotropic Dirac
cone in presence a magnetic field. Our work represents a route towards
detecting and understanding the mechanism in a correlation driven topological
transition through electron transport measurements, complemented by ab-initio
electronic structure calculations.

Following up on the systematic compactification of the two-channel Kondo
model (and its multi-channel extensions; see companion paper I) and the
demonstration of its validity over the past proposal of compactification, we
resort to a study of scaling using Anderson's simple poor man's procedure to
carry out a comparative study of these two and the original model. By doing so
we unveil a universal agreement among the three models in how they flow upon
scaling, and suggest what are the general limits of such a concordance. In this
way we further elucidate the conditions under which the standard
simplifications implicit in many bosonization-based mappings (particularly of
quantum impurity models) can be used reliably, and when the consistent
bosonization-debosonization approach is needed.

We show that unconstrained asymmetric dissolving solids floating in a fluid
can move rectilinearly as a result of attached density currents which occur
along their inclined surfaces. Solids in the form of boats composed of
centimeter-scale sugar and salt slabs attached to a buoy are observed to move
rapidly in water with speeds up to 5 mm/s determined by the inclination angle
and orientation of the dissolving surfaces. While symmetric boats drift slowly,
asymmetric boats are observed to accelerate rapidly along a line before
reaching a terminal velocity when their drag matches the thrust generated by
dissolution. By visualizing the flow around the body, we show that the boat
velocity is always directed opposite to the horizontal component of the density
current. We derive the thrust acting on the body from its measured kinematics,
and show that the propulsion mechanism is consistent with the unbalanced
momentum generated by the attached density current. We obtain an analytical
formula for the body speed depending on geometry and material properties, and
show that it captures the observed trends reasonably. Our analysis shows that
the gravity current sets the scale of the body speed consistent with our
observations, and we estimate that speeds can grow slowly as the cube-root of
the length of the inclined dissolving surface. The dynamics of dissolving
solids demonstrated here applies equally well to solids undergoing phase
change, and may enhance the drift of melting icebergs, besides unraveling a
primal strategy by which to achieve locomotion in active matter.

<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical study of dolerophanite Cu$_2$OSO$_4$, a layered
kagome-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ magnetic insulator that can be described either
as a system of chains coupled through dimers or as a kagome lattice where every
third spin is replaced by a ferromagnetic spin dimer. Building on insights from
ab initio calculations, classical numerical minimizations, and semiclassical
expansions, we arrive at a minimal microscopic description that accounts for
the experimental data reported so far, including the nature of the magnetic
order, the reported spin length, and the observed anisotropy. The latter arises
by a peculiar competition between the antisymmetric (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) and
the symmetric part of the exchange anisotropy, which gives rise to a two-step
re-orientation process involving two successive continuous phase transitions.
Our work uncovers mechanisms stabilizing canted ferrimagnetic order in kagome
systems, and highlights strong magnetic anisotropy in the presence if
dissimilar magnetic orbitals on crystallographically nonequivalent Cu sites. We
also show how these anisotropy terms affect the spin-wave spectrum and how they
can be tracked experimentally.

We report the single crystal growth and characterization of EuIn$_2$, a
magnetic topological semimetal candidate according to our density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. We present results from electrical resistance,
magnetization, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray resonant magnetic scattering
(XRMS) measurements. We observe three magnetic transitions at
$T_{\text{N}1}\sim 14.2~$K, $T_{\text{N}2}\sim12.8~$K and $T_{\text{N}3}\sim
11~$K, signatures of which are consistently seen in anisotropic temperature
dependent magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistance data. M\"ossbauer
spectroscopy measurements on ground crystals suggest an incommensurate
sinusoidally modulated magnetic structure below the transition at
$T_{\text{N}1}\sim 14~$K, followed by the appearance of higher harmonics in the
modulation on further cooling roughly below $T_{\text{N}2}\sim13~$K, before the
moment distribution squaring up below the lowest transition around
$T_{\text{N}3}\sim 11~$K. XRMS measurements showed the appearance of magnetic
Bragg peaks below $T_{\text{N}1}\sim14~$K, with a propagation vector of
$\bm{\tau}$ $=(\tau_h,\bar{\tau}_h,0)$, with $\tau_h$varying with temperature,
and showing a jump at $T_{\text{N}3}\sim11$~K. The temperature dependence of
$\tau_h$ between $\sim11$~K and $14$~K shows incommensurate values consistent
with the M\"{o}ssbauer data. XRMS data indicate that $\tau_h$ remains
incommensurate at low temperatures and locks into $\tau_h=0.3443(1)$.

We carry out a field-theoretical renormalization group procedure based on the
Callan-Symanzik equation to calculate the detailed flow for the (multi)
two-channel Kondo model and its compactified versions. In doing so, we go
beyond the universal terms in the beta function we obtained using poor man's
scaling (see companion paper II) and culminate our analysis of how the
compactified versions of the model fare against the original one. Among other
results, we explore the large-channel-number limit and also extend our
considerations to the finite temperature crossover region. Moreover, we gain
insights into the contradistinction between the consistent vs. conventional
bosonization-debosonization formalisms, thereby advancing our understanding on
multiple fronts. In particular, we make use of renormalization-flow arguments
to further justify the consistent refermionization of the parallel Kondo
interaction we presented earlier (see companion paper I).

The report of near-ambient superconductivity in nitrogen-doped lutetium
hydrides could represent an epochal discovery, awaited for more than a century,
possibly leading to inconceivable scientific and technological implications.
However, after months since the first report, clear experimental and
theoretical confirmations are yet to come: The initially proposed compound
structure fails to explain the superconducting behavior, calling for a shift in
perspective. By means of machine-learning-accelerated force-field molecular
dynamics, we explore the formation of H2 molecules in nitrogen-doped lutetium
hydride, demonstrating the active role of nitrogen in stabilizing this phase.
Our density functional theory calculations show that the presence of hydrogen
molecules leads to a dynamically stable structure, characterized by a
superconducting phase requiring no applied pressure, although the predicted
temperatures are still much lower than room temperature. We believe that the
possibility to stabilize hydrogen in molecular form represents a new route to
explore disordered phases in hydrides and their transport properties at near
ambient conditions.

Can topography be used to control bacteria accumulation? We address this
question in the model system of smooth-swimming and run-and-tumble
\textit{Escherichia coli} swimming near a sinusoidal surface, and show that the
accumulation of bacteria is determined by the characteristic curvature of the
surface. For low curvatures, cells swim along the surface due to steric
alignment and are ejected from the surface when they reach the peak of the
sinusoid. Increasing curvature enhances this effect and reduces the density of
bacteria in the curved surface. However, for curvatures larger than
$\kappa^*\approx 0.3 \mu m^{-1}$, bacteria become trapped in the valleys, where
they can remain for long periods of time. Minimal simulations considering only
steric interactions with the surface reproduce these results and give insights
into the physical mechanisms defining the critical curvature, which is found to
scale with the inverse of the bacterial length. We show that for curvatures
larger than $\kappa^*$, the otherwise stable alignment with the wall becomes
unstable while the stable orientation is now perpendicular to the wall, thus
predicting accurately the onset of trapping at the valleys.

Dynamical many-body freezing occurs in periodic transverse field-driven
integrable quantum spin systems. Under resonance conditions, quantum dynamics
causes practically infinite hysteresis in the drive response, maintaining its
starting value. We find similar resonant freezing in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
(LMG) model. In the LMG, the resonance conditions in the driving field
suppresses the heating postulated by the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis
(ETH) by inducing Dynamical Many Body Localization, or DMBL. This is in
contrast to Many Body Localization (MBL), which requires disorder to suppress
ETH. DMBL has been validated by the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) of the
quasi-stationary Floquet modes. Similarly to the TFIM, the LMG exhibits
high-frequency localization only at the resonances. IPR localization in the LMG
deteriorates with an inverse system size law at lower frequencies, which
indicates heating to infinite temperature. Furthermore, adiabatically
increasing frequency and amplitude from low values raises the Floquet state IPR
in the LMG from nearly zero to unity, indicating a phase crossover. This
occurrence enables a future technique to construct an MBL engine in clean
systems that can be cycled by adjusting drive parameters only.

<h3>Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter</h3>

<br>
<br>
Active matter describes systems whose constituents convert energy from their
surroundings into directed motion, such as bacteria or catalytic colloids. We
unravel a remarkable direct link between the dynamics and thermodynamics for
suspensions of such active particles: The thermodynamic equivalent of
irreversibility is the swim pressure. Like in the famous fluctuation theorems
of stochastic thermodynamics, irreversibility is defined as the log-ratio of
the probabilities to observe a given set of particle trajectories and their
time reverses. Our discovery is thus similar in spirit to what is known for
passive systems, for which those fluctuation theorems relate the
irreversibility to the thermodynamic entropy. It is based on numerical
simulations and on analytical arguments for the limits of low particle density
and/or high activity in the paradigmatic model of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
particles.

Materials acceleration platforms (MAPs) combine automation and artificial
intelligence to accelerate the discovery of molecules and materials. They have
potential to play a role in addressing complex societal problems such as
climate change. Solar chemicals and fuels generation via heterogeneous CO2
photo(thermal)catalysis is a relatively unexplored process that holds potential
for contributing towards an environmentally and economically sustainable
future, and therefore a very promising application for MAP science and
engineering. Here, we present a brief overview of how design and innovation in
heterogeneous CO2 photo(thermal)catalysis, from materials discovery to
engineering and scale-up, could benefit from MAPs. We discuss relevant design
and performance descriptors and the level of automation of state-of-the-art
experimental techniques, and we review examples of artificial intelligence in
data analysis. Based on these precedents, we finally propose a MAP outline for
autonomous and accelerated discoveries in the emerging field of solar chemicals
and fuels sourced from CO2 photo(thermal)catalysis.

<br>
<i>Sourav Roy, C.D. Santagelo</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a framework to understand the mechanics of metamaterial sheets on
curved surfaces. Here we have constructed a continuum elastic theory of
mechanical metamaterials by introducing an auxiliary, scalar gauge-like field
that absorbs the strain along the soft mode and projects out the stiff ones. We
propose a general form of the elastic energy of a mechanism based metamaterial
sheet and specialize to the cases of dilational metamaterials and shear
metamaterials conforming to positively and negatively curved substrates in the
F\"{o}ppl-Von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n limit of small strains. We perform numerical
simulations of these systems and obtain good agreement with our analytical
predictions. This work provides a framework that can be easily extended to
explore non-linear soft modes in metamaterial elasticity in future.

An interface connecting two distinct conformal field theories hosts rich
critical behaviors. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of
such critical interface theories for probing the underlying universality. As
inspired by holographic perspectives, we demonstrate vital features of various
entanglement measures regarding such interfaces based on several paradigmatic
lattice models. Crucially, for two subsystems adjacent at the interface, the
mutual information and the reflected entropy exhibit identical leading
logarithmic scaling, giving an effective interface central charge that takes
the same value as the smaller central charge of the two conformal field
theories. Our work demonstrates that the entanglement measure offers a powerful
tool to explore the rich physics in critical interface theories.

<h3>Half-quantum flux in spin-triplet superconducting rings with bias  current</h3>

<br>
<br>
Effects of a bias electric current have been theoretically investigated in a
spin-triplet superconducting ring in a magnetic field. Based on the
Ginzburg-Landau theory, we show that the bias current can stabilize a
half-quantum-flux (HQF) state via couplings to the Zeeman field and the
dipole-type spin-orbit interaction, the latter becoming active when the field
is tilted from the ring axis. The emergence of the HQF state is reflected as a
field-induced half-quantum-shift in the Little-Parks (LP) oscillation in the
critical current. Possible relevance to recent LP experiments is also
discussed.

We present analytic expressions for the density of states and its consistent
derivation for the two-dimensional Qi-Wu-Zhang (QWZ) Hamiltonian, a generic
model for the Chern topological insulators of class A. This density of states
is expressed in terms of elliptical integrals. We discuss and plot special
cases of the dispersion relations and the corresponding densities of states.
Spectral moments are also presented. The exact formulae ought to be useful in
determining physical properties of the non-interacting Chern insulators and
within the dynamical mean-field theory for interacting fermions with the QWZ
Hamiltonian in the non-interacting limit.

Acoustic traps use forces exerted by sound waves to confine and transport
small objects. The dynamics of an object moving in the force landscape of an
acoustic trap can be significantly influenced by the inertia of the surrounding
fluid medium. These inertial effects can be observed by setting a trapped
object in oscillation and tracking it as it relaxes back to mechanical
equilibrium in its trap. Large deviations from Stokesian dynamics during this
process can be explained quantitatively by accounting for boundary-layer
effects in the fluid. The measured oscillations of a perturbed particle then
can be used not only to calibrate the trap but also to characterize the
particle.

Two-dimensional (2D) ferrovalley semiconductor (FVSC) with spontaneous valley
polarization offers an exciting material platform for probing Berry phase
physics. How FVSC can be incorporated in valleytronic device applications,
however, remain an open question. Here we generalize the concept of
metal/semiconductor (MS) contact into the realm of valleytronics. We propose
the concept of half-valley Ohmic contact in FVSC/graphene heterostructures
where the two valleys of FVSC separately forms Ohmic and Schottky contacts with
the those of graphene, thus allowing current to be valley-selectively injected
through the `Ohmic' valley while being blocked in the `Schottky' valley. We
develop a theory of \emph{contact-limited valley-contrasting current injection}
and demonstrate such transport mechanism can produce gate-tunable
valley-polarized injection current across a FVSC/graphene contact. Using
RuCl$_2$/graphene heterostructure as a proof of concept, we illustrate a device
concept of valleytronic barristor in whcih high valley polarization efficiency,
accompanied by a sizable current on/off ratio, can be achieved under
experimentally achievable electrostatic gating conditions. These findings
uncover contact-limited valley-contrasting current injection as an efficient
mechanism for valley polarization manipulation, and reveals the potential of
valleytronic MS contact as a functional building block of valleytronic device
technology.

<h3>Buzdin, Shapiro and Chimera Steps in $\varphi_0$ Josephson Junctions</h3>

<br>
The unique resonance and locking phenomena in the
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction under
external electromagnetic radiation are demonstrated when not just the electric
but also the magnetic component of external radiation is taken into account.
Due to the coupling of superconductivity and magnetism in this system, the
magnetic moment precession of the ferromagnetic layer caused by the magnetic
component of external radiation can lock the Josephson oscillations, which
results in the appearance of the particular type of steps in the
current-voltage characteristics, completely different from the well known
Shapiro steps. We call these steps the Buzdin steps in the case when the system
is driven only by the magnetic component and the chimera steps in the case when
both magnetic and electric components are present. Unlike the Shapiro steps
where the magnetization remains constant along the step, here it is changing
though the system is locked. The spin-orbit coupling substantially contributes
to the amplitude, i.e., the size of these steps. Dramatic changes in their
amplitudes are also observed at frequencies near the ferromagnetic resonance.
Combinations of the Josephson and Kittel ferromagnetic resonances together with
different types of locking pronounced in dynamics and current-voltage
characteristics make the physics of this system very interesting and open up a
series of novel applications.

<h3>Static disorder in soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy:  theory and application to ion-bombarded InAs(110)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most
ubiquitous characterization techniques utilized in the field of condensed
matter physics. The resulting spectral intensity consists of a coherent and
incoherent part, whose relative contribution is governed by atomic disorder,
where thermal contribution is expressed in terms of the Debye-Waller factor
(DWF). In this work, we present a soft-X-ray study on the sputter-induced
disorder of InAs(110) surface. We define a new quantity, referred to as the
coherence factor FC, which is the analogue of the DWF, extended to static
disorder. We show that FC alone can be used to quantify the depletion of
coherent intensity with increasing disorder, and, in combination with the DWF,
allows considerations of thermal and static disorder effects on the same
footing. Our study also unveils an intriguing finding: as disorder increases,
the ARPES intensity of quantum well states originating from the conduction band
depletes more rapidly compared to the valence bands. This difference can be
attributed to the predominance of quasi-elastic defect scattering and the
difference in phase space available for such scattering for conduction-band
(CB) and valence-band (VB) initial states. Specifically, the absence of empty
states well below the Fermi energy (EF) hinders the quasi-elastic scattering of
the VB states, while their abundance in vicinity of EF enhances the scattering
rate of the CB states. Additionally, we observe no noticeable increase in
broadening of the VB dispersions as the sputter-induced disorder increases.
This observation aligns with the notion that valence initial states are less
likely to experience the quasi-elastic defect scattering, which would shorten
their lifetime, and with the random uncorrelated nature of the defects
introduced by the ion sputtering.

<h3>Inhomogeneous high temperature melting and decoupling of charge density  waves in spin-triplet superconductor UTe2</h3>

<br>

Periodic spatial modulations of the superfluid density, or pair density
waves, have now been widely detected in unconventional superconductors, either
as the primary or the secondary states accompanying charge density waves.
Understanding how these density waves emerge, or conversely get suppressed by
external parameters, provides an important insight into their nature. Here we
use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study the evolution
of density waves in the heavy fermion spin-triplet superconductor UTe2 as a
function of temperature and magnetic field. We discover that charge
modulations, composed of three different wave vectors gradually weaken but
persist to a surprisingly high temperature T_CDW ~ 10-12 K. By tracking the
local amplitude of modulations, we find that these modulations become spatially
inhomogeneous, and form patches that shrink in size with higher temperature or
with applied magnetic field. Interestingly, one of the density wave vectors
along the mirror symmetry has a slightly different temperature onset, thus
revealing an unexpected decoupling of the three-component CDW state.
Importantly, T_CDW determined from our work matches closely to the temperature
scale believed to be related to magnetic fluctuations, providing the first
possible connection between density waves observed by surface probes and bulk
measurements. Combined with magnetic field sensitivity of the modulations, this
could point towards an important role of spin fluctuations or short-range
magnetic order in the formation of the primary charge density wave.

<h3>Phase transitions in self-gravitating systems and bacterial populations  surrounding a central body</h3>

We study the nature of phase transitions in a self-gravitating classical gas
in the presence of a central body. The central body can mimic a black hole at
the center of a galaxy or a rocky core (protoplanet) in the context of
planetary formation. In the chemotaxis of bacterial populations, sharing formal
analogies with self-gravitating systems, the central body can be a supply of
``food'' (chemoattractant). We consider both microcanonical (fixed energy) and
canonical (fixed temperature) descriptions and study the inequivalence of
statistical ensembles. At high energies (resp. high temperatures), the system
is in a ``gaseous'' phase and at low energies (resp. low temperatures) it is in
a condensed phase with a ``cusp-halo'' structure, where the cusp corresponds to
the rapid increase of the density of the gas at the contact with the central
body. For a fixed density $\rho_{*}$ of the central body, we show the existence
of two critical points in the phase diagram, one in each ensemble, depending on
the core radius $R_{*}$: for small radii $R_{*}<R_{*}^{\rm MCP}$, there exist
both microcanonical and canonical phase transitions (that are zeroth and first
order); for intermediate radii $R_{*}^{\rm MCP}<R_{*}<R_{*}^{\rm CCP}$, only
canonical phase transitions are present; and for large radii $R_{*}>R_{*}^{\rm
CCP}$, there is no phase transition at all. We study how the nature of these
phase transitions changes as a function of the dimension of space. We also
discuss the analogies and the differences with phase transitions in the
self-gravitating Fermi gas [P.H. Chavanis, Phys. Rev. E 65, 056123 (2002)].

We characterize the equilibrium properties of a model of $y$ coupled binary
perceptrons in the teacher-student scenario, subject to a suitable learning
rule, with an explicit ferromagnetic coupling proportional to the Hamming
distance between the students' weights. In contrast to recent works, we analyze
a more general setting in which a thermal noise is present that affects the
generalization performance of each student. Specifically, in the presence of a
nonzero temperature, which assigns nonzero probability to configurations that
misclassify samples with respect to the teacher's prescription, we find that
the coupling of replicas leads to a shift of the phase diagram to smaller
values of $\alpha$: This suggests that the free energy landscape gets smoother
around the solution with good generalization (i.e., the teacher) at a fixed
fraction of reviewed examples, which allows local update algorithms such as
Simulated Annealing to reach the solution before the dynamics gets frozen.
Finally, from a learning perspective, these results suggest that more students
(in this case, with the same amount of data) are able to learn the same rule
when coupled together with a smaller amount of data.

Recent density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on copper-doped lead
apatite $\text{Pb}_9\text{Cu}(\text{PO}_4)_6\text{O}$ indicated various
interesting band structure properties in the close vicinity to the Fermi
surface including symmetry-enforced band crossings, narrow bands, and van-Hove
singularities. These studies assume a regular arrangement of the dopant, such
that the space group (SG) 176 (P6$\text{}_3$/m) is reduced to SG 143 (P3). We
construct tight-binding models for this space group with two and four bands. A
first analysis of these models show excellent agreement with the key features
of the DFT results. We show that the symmetry enforced band crossings at
$\Gamma$ and $A$ are double Weyl points, implying Chern bands for $k_z\neq
0,\pi$. We map out the distribution of Berry curvature and quantum metric and
discuss their relation to the orbital character. For a specific set of
parameters we find a singular flat band.

A topological 'Thouless' pump represents the quantised motion of particles in
response to a slow, cyclic modulation of external control parameters. The
Thouless pump, like the quantum Hall effect, is of fundamental interest in
physics because it links physically measurable quantities, such as particle
currents, to geometric properties of the experimental system, which can be
robust against perturbations and thus technologically useful. So far,
experiments probing the interplay between topology and inter-particle
interactions have remained relatively scarce. Here we observe a Thouless-type
charge pump in which the particle current and its directionality inherently
rely on the presence of strong interactions. Experimentally, we utilise
fermionic atoms in a dynamical superlattice which traces a pump trajectory that
remains trivial in the non-interacting limit. Remarkably, the transferred
charge in the interacting system is half of its usual value in the
non-interacting case, in agreement with matrix-product-state simulations. Our
experiments suggest that Thouless charge pumps are promising platforms to gain
insights into interaction-driven topological transitions and topological
quantum matter.
