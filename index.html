<h3>Comparing individual-based models of collective movements: active  particles versus active cells</h3>

Collectively coordinated cell migration plays a role in tissue embryogenesis,
cancer, homeostasis and healing. To study these processes, different cell-based
modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular
automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or
extended detailed cell shape contours. In the spirit of what Osborne et al. did
for cellular tissue structure simulation models, we here compare five
simulation models of collective cell motion, chosen to be representative in
increasing order of included detail. They are Vicsek-Gr\'egoire particles,
Szab\'o-like particles, active particles with a Voronoi tesselation, the active
cellular Potts model, and active multiparticle cells. We examine how these
models compare when applied to the same biological problem, and what
differences in behaviour are due to different model assumptions and
abstractions. For that purpose, we use a benchmark that discriminates between
complex material flow models, and that can be experimentally approached using
cell cultures: the flow within a channel around a circular obstacle, that is,
the geometry Stokes used in his historical 1851 experiment. For each model we
explain how to best implement it; vary cell density, attraction force and
alignment interaction; draw the resulting maps of velocity, density and
deformation fields; and eventually discuss its respective advantages and
limitations. We thus provide a recommendation on how to select a model to
answer a given question, and we examine whether models of active particles and
active cells display similar collective effects.

We show that for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) away from charge
neutrality, although quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations suffer from the sign
problem, the computational complexity is at most polynomial at certain integer
fillings. For even integer fillings, this polynomial complexity survives even
if an extra inter-valley attractive interaction is introduced, on top of
Coulomb repulsions. This observation allows us to simulate magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene and to obtain accurate phase diagram and dynamical properties.
At the chiral limit and filling $\nu=1$, the simulations reveal a thermodynamic
transition separating metallic state and a $C=1$ correlated Chern insulator --
topological Mott insulator (TMI) -- and the pseudogap spectrum slightly above
the transition temperature. The ground state excitation spectra of the TMI
exhibit a spin-valley U(4) Goldstone mode and a time reversal restoring
excitonic gap smaller than the single particle gap. These results are
qualitatively consistent with the recent experimental findings at zero-field
and $\nu=1$ filling in $h$-BN nonaligned TBG.

Optical measurements under externally applied stresses allow us to study the
materials' electronic structure by comparing the pressure evolution of optical
peaks obtained from experiments and theoretical calculations. We examine the
stress-induced changes in electronic structure for the thermodynamically stable
1T polytype of selected MX2 compounds (M=Hf, Zr, Sn; X=S, Se), using the
density functional theory. We demonstrate that considered 1T-MX2 materials are
semiconducting with indirect character of the band gap, irrespective to the
employed pressure as predicted using modified Becke-Johnson potential. We
determine energies of direct interband transitions between bands extrema and in
band-nesting regions close to Fermi level. Generally, the studied transitions
are optically active, exhibiting in-plane polarization of light. Finally, we
quantify their energy trends under external hydrostatic, uniaxial, and biaxial
stresses by determining the linear pressure coefficients. Generally, negative
pressure coefficients are obtained implying the narrowing of the band gap. The
semiconducting-to-metal transition are predicted under hydrostatic pressure. We
discuss these trends in terms of orbital composition of involved electronic
bands. In addition, we demonstrate that the measured pressure coefficients of
HfS2 and HfSe2 absorption edges are in perfect agreement with our predictions.
Comprehensive and easy-to-interpret tables containing the optical features are
provided to form the basis for assignation of optical peaks in future
measurements.

<h3>1/4 is the new 1/2: Interaction-induced Quantum Anomalous and Spin Hall  Mott Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11486" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11486</a>

We introduce interactions into two general models for quantum spin Hall
physics. Although the traditional picture is that such physics appears when the
two lower spinful bands are occupied, that is, half-filling, we show that in
the presence of strong interactions, the quarter-filled state instead exhibits
the quantum spin Hall effect with spin Chern number $C_s=1$. A topological Mott
insulator is the underlying cause lying outside the standard $\mathbb Z_2$
topological classification. An intermediate interacting regime that exhibits a
quantum anomalous Hall effect emerges when the lower band is `flat' so that the
interaction is large compared to the bandwidth but remains comparable to or
smaller than the topological gap. This state transitions to the quantum spin
Hall effect once the interactions are sufficiently large. We show that this
intermediate regime is consistent with the simultaneous observation in
transition metal dichalcogenide moir{\'e} materials of a quantum anomalous Hall
phase at quarter filling and a quantum spin Hall effect at half-filling. The
valley coherence seen experimentally can be captured in a bi-layer extension of
our results.

<h3>Moiré-of-moiré low-energy effective theory of twisted trilayer  graphene</h3>

Stacking three monolayers of graphene with a twist generally produces two
moir\'e patterns. A moir\'e of moir\'e structure then emerges at larger
distance where the three layers periodically realign. We devise here an
effective low-energy theory to describe the spectrum at distances larger than
the moir\'e lengthscale. In each valley of the underlying graphene, the theory
comprises one Dirac cone at the ${\bf \Gamma}_M$ point of the moir\'e Brillouin
zone and two weakly gapped points at ${\bf K}_M$ and ${\bf K}'_M$. The
velocities and small gaps exhibit a spatial dependence in the
moir\'e-of-moir\'e unit cell, entailing a non-abelian connection potential
which ensures gauge invariance. The resulting model is numerically solved and a
fully connected spectrum is obtained, which is protected by the combination of
time-reversal and twofold-rotation symmetries.

<h3>A setup for direct measurement of the adiabatic temperature change in  magnetocaloric materials</h3>

In order to find a highly efficient, environment-friendly magnetic
refrigerant, direct measurements of the adiabatic temperature change $\Delta
T_{adb}$ is required. Here, in this work, a simple setup for the $\Delta
T_{adb}$ measurement is presented. Using a permanent magnet Halbach array with
a maximum magnetic field of $1.8$ T and a rate of magnetic field change of $5$
T/s, accurate determination of $\Delta T_{adb}$ is possible in this system. The
operating temperature range of the system is from $100$ K to $400$ K, designed
for the characterization of materials with potential for room temperature
magnetic refrigeration applications. Using the setup, the $\Delta T_{adb}$ of a
first-order and a second-order compound have been studied. Results from the
direct measurement for the first-order compound have been compared with $\Delta
T_{adb}$ calculated from the temperature and magnetic field dependent specific
heat data. By comparing results from direct and indirect measurements, it is
concluded that for a reliable characterization of the magnetocaloric effect,
direct measurement of $\Delta T_{adb}$ should be adopted.

<h3>Real-space entanglement spectra of projected fractional quantum Hall  states using Monte Carlo methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11514" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11514</a>

Real-space entanglement spectrum (RSES) of a quantum Hall (QH) wavefunction
gives a natural route to infer the nature of its edge excitations. Computation
of RSES becomes expensive with an increase in the number of particles and
included Landau levels (LL). RSES can be efficiently computed using Monte Carlo
(MC) methods for trial states that can be written as products of determinants
such as the composite fermion (CF) and parton states. This computational
efficiency also applies to the RSES of lowest Landau level (LLL) projected CF
and parton states; however, LLL projection to be used here requires
approximations that generalize the Jain Kamilla (JK) projection. This work is a
careful study of how this approximation should be made. We identify the
approximation closest in spirit to JK projection and perform tests of the
approximations involved in the projection by comparing the MC results with the
RSES obtained from computationally expensive but exact methods. We present the
techniques and use them to calculate the exact RSES of the exact LLL projected
bosonic Jain $2/3$ state in bipartition of systems of sizes up to $N=24$ on the
sphere. For the lowest few angular momentum sectors of the RSES, we present
evidence to show that MC results closely match the exact spectra. We also
discuss other plausible projection schemes. We also calculate the exact RSES of
the unprojected fermionic Jain $2/5$ state obtained from the exact
diagonalization of the Trugman-Kivelson Hamiltonian in the two lowest LLs on
the sphere. By comparing with the RSES of the unprojected $2/5$ state from
Monte Carlo methods, we show that the latter is practically exact.

<h3>Ab initio Canonical Sampling based on Variational Inference</h3>

Finite temperature calculations, based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations, are a powerful tool able to predict material properties that
cannot be deduced from ground state calculations. However, the high
computational cost of AIMD limits its applicability for large or complex
systems. To circumvent this limitation we introduce a new method named Machine
Learning Assisted Canonical Sampling (MLACS), which accelerates the sampling of
the Born--Oppenheimer potential surface in the canonical ensemble. Based on a
self-consistent variational procedure, the method iteratively trains a Machine
Learning Interatomic Potential to generate configurations that approximate the
canonical distribution of positions associated with the ab initio potential
energy. By proving the reliability of the method on anharmonic systems, we show
that the method is able to reproduce the results of AIMD with an ab initio
accuracy at a fraction of its computational cost.

<h3>Kinetics of transformation, border of metastable miscibility gap in  Fe-Cr alloy and limit of Cr solubility in iron at 858 K</h3>

The study was aimed at determination of the position of the Fe-rich border of
the metastable miscibility gap (MMG) and of the solubility limit of Cr in iron
at 858 K. Towards this end a Fe73.7Cr26.3 alloy was isothermally annealed at
858 K in vacuum up to 8144 hours and M\"ossbauer spectra were recorded at room
temperature after every step of the annealing. Three spectral parameters viz.
the average hyperfine field, <B>, the average isomer shift, <IS>, and the
probability of the atomic configuration with no Cr atoms in the two-shell
vicinity of the probe Fe atoms, P(0,0), gave evidence that the transformation
process takes place in two stages. All three parameters could have been well
described in terms of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov equation, yielding
kinetics parameters. The first stage, associated with the phase decomposition,
proceeded much faster than the second stage, associated with the alpha-to-sigma
phase transformation. The most reliable estimation of the position of the MMG
and that of the value of the Cr solubility limit was obtained from the
annealing time dependence of <B>, namely 24.5 at.% Cr for the former and 20.3
at.% Cr for the latter. A comparison of these figures with the recent phase
diagrams pertinent to Fe-Cr system was done.

<h3>Shape Effect on Interaction Dynamics of Tetrahedral Nanoplastics and  Cell Membrane</h3>

Cellular uptake of nanoplastics is instrumental in their environmental
accumulation and transfers to humans through the food chain. Despite extensive
studies using spherical plastic nanoparticles, the influence of the
morphological characteristics of environmentally released nanoplastics is
understudied. Using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, we modeled
the interaction between hydrophobic nanotetrahedra and a cell membrane,
featuring high shape anisotropy and large surface curvature seen for
environmental nanoplastics. We observe robust uptake of nanotetrahedra with
sharp vertices and edges by the lipid membrane. Two local energy minimum
configurations of nanotetrahedra embedded in the membrane bilayer were
identified for particles of large sizes. Further analysis of particle dynamics
within the membrane shows that the two interaction states exhibit distinct
translational and rotational dynamics in the directions normal and parallel to
the plane of the membrane. The membrane confinement significantly arrests the
out-of-plane motion, resulting in caged translation and subdiffusive rotation.
While the in-plane diffusion remains Brownian, we find that the translational
and rotational modes decouple from each other as nanotetrahedra size increases.
The rotational diffusion decreases by a greater extent compared to the
translational diffusion, deviating from the continuum theory predictions. These
results provide fundamental insight into the shape effect on the nanoparticle
dynamics in crowded lipid membranes.

<h3>Effect of local stress on accurate modeling of bacterial outer membranes  using all-atom molecular dynamics</h3>

Biological membranes are fundamental components of living organisms that play
an undeniable role in their survival. Molecular dynamics (MD) serves as an
essential computational tool for studying biomembranes on molecular and
atomistic scales. The status quo of MD simulations of biomembranes studies a
nanometer-sized membrane patch periodically extended under periodic boundary
conditions (PBC). In nature, membranes are usually composed of different lipids
in their two layers (referred to as leaflets). This compositional asymmetry
imposes a fixed ratio of lipid numbers between the two leaflets in a
periodically constrained membrane, which needs to be set appropriately. The
widely adopted methods of defining leaflet lipid ratio suffer from the lack of
control over the mechanical tension of each leaflet, which could significantly
influence research findings. In this study, we investigate the role of
membrane-building protocol and the resulting initial stress state on the
interaction between small molecules and asymmetric membranes. We model the
outer membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria using two different building
protocols and probe their interactions with the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal
(PQS). Our results show that differential stress could shift the position of
free energy minimum for the PQS molecule between the two leaflets of the
asymmetric membrane. This work provides critical insights into the relationship
between the initial per-leaflet tension and the spontaneous intercalation of
PQS.

<h3>Real space representation of topological system: twisted bilayer  graphene as an example</h3>

We construct a Wannier basis for twisted bilayer graphene that is projected
only from the Bloch functions of the twisted bilayer flat bands. The $C_3$ and
$C_{2} \mathcal{T}$ symmetries act locally on the Wannier functions while the
Wannier function charge density is strongly peaked at the triangular sites and
becomes fully sublattice-polarized in the chiral limit. The Wannier functions
have a power-law tail, due to the topological obstruction, but most of the
charge density is concentrated within one unit cell so that the on-site local
Coulomb interaction is much larger than the further neighbor interactions and
in general the Hamiltonian parameters may be accurately estimated from a modest
number of Wannier functions. One exception is the momentum space components of
the single-particle Hamiltonian, where because of the topological obstruction
convergence is non-uniform across the Brillouin zone. We observe, however, that
mixed position and momentum space representations may be used to avoid this
difficulty in the context of quantum embedding methods. Our work provides a new
route to study systems with topological obstructions and paves the way for the
future investigation of correlated states in twisted bilayer graphene,
including studies of non-integer fillings and temperature dependence.

<h3>Increased localization of Majorana modes in antiferromagnetic chains on  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11587" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11587</a>

<br>
<br>
Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems are a key platform for
custom-designed topological superconductors. Ideally, the ends of a
one-dimensional MSH structure will host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs), the
fundamental unit of topological quantum computing. However, some of the
experiments with ferromagnetic chains show a more complicated picture. Due to
tiny gap sizes and hence long coherence lengths MZMs might hybridize and lose
their topological protection. Recent experiments on a niobium surface have
shown that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains may be engineered,
with the magnetic order depending on the crystallographic direction of the
chain. While ferromagnetic chains are well understood, antiferromagnetic chains
are less so. Here we study two models inspired by the niobium surface: a
minimal model to elucidate the general topological properties of
antiferromagnetic chains, and an extended model to more closely simulate a real
system by mimicking the proximity effect. We find that in general for
antiferromagnetic chains the topological gap is larger than for ferromagnetic
ones and thus coherence lengths are shorter for antiferromagnetic chains,
yielding more pronounced localization of MZMs in these chains. While
topological phases for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains both
depend on the magnetic moment of the adatoms and the chemical potential, we
find that antiferromagnetic chains also have a strong dependence on the
magnitude of Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the surface.

<h3>Canonical Nonlinearity for Coupled Linear Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11609" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11609</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
For classical discrete system under constant composition, typically reffered
to as substitutional alloys, correspondence between interatomic many-body
interactions and structure in thermodynamic equilibrium exhibit profound,
complicated nonlinearity (canonical nonlinearity). Our recent studies clarify
that the nonlinearity can be reasonablly described both by specially-introduced
vector field on configuration space and by corresponding diverngence on
statistical manifold, where they are bridged through stochastic thermodynamics.
These studies indicate that to understand the conservation and upper bound for
nonlinearity, thermodynamic behavior for the ideally-introduced linear system
(LS) plays significant role. Moreover, any practical alloy system can be
constructed through proper coupling of the LSs. Following these ideas, we here
investigate behavior of the nonlinearity for coupled LS (CLS), through the
special vector field. We show the basic concepts of CLS based on
alpha-geometry, and construct CLSs that individually mimic simple effects of
e.g., atomic vacancy and layered alloy compounds. We also propose
indentifycation of many-body interactions for nonlinearity among multiple LSs
in the extention of the concept of dynamic mode decomposition, which cannot be
simply explained by superpositions of pairwise interactions for constituent
LSs.

<h3>Stochastic methods for slip prediction in a sheared granular system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11614" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11614</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We consider a sheared granular system experiencing intermittent dynamics of
stick-slip type via discrete element simulations. The considered setup consists
of a two-dimensional system of soft frictional particles sandwiched between
solid walls, one of which is exposed to a shearing force. The slip events are
detected using stochastic state space models applied to various measures
describing the system. We show that the measures describing the forces between
the particles provide earlier detection of an upcoming slip event than the
measures based solely on the wall movement. By comparing the detection times
obtained from the considered measures, we observe that a typical slip event
starts with a local change in the force network. However, some local changes do
not spread globally over the force network. For the changes that become global,
we find a sharp critical value for their size. If the size of a global change
exceeds the critical value, then it triggers a slip event; if it does not, then
a much weaker micro-slip follows. Quantification of the changes in the force
network is made possible by formulating clear and precise measures describing
their static and dynamic properties.

<h3>A new quasi-one-dimensional transition metal chalcogenide semiconductor  (Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The discovery of new low-dimensional transition metal chalcogenides is
contributing to the already prosperous family of these materials. In this
study, needle-shaped single crystals of a new quasi-one-dimensional material
(Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$ were grown by chemical vapor transport, and the
structure was solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). The new
structure has one-dimensional (Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)$_n$ chains along the [101]
direction, with two I$^-$ ions per formula unit directly bonded to Nb$^{5+}$.
The other two I$^-$ ions are loosely coordinated and intercalate between the
chains. Individual chains are chiral, and stack along the $b$ axis in opposing
directions, giving space group $P2_1/c$. The phase purity and crystal structure
was verified by powder XRD. Density functional theory calculations show
(Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$ to be a semiconductor with a direct band gap of
around 0.6 eV. Resistivity measurements of bulk crystals and micro-patterned
devices demonstrate that (Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$ has an activation energy
of around 0.1 eV, and no anomaly or transition was seen upon cooling.
(Nb$_4$Se$_{15}$I$_2$)I$_2$ does not undergo structural phase transformation
from room temperature down to 8.2 K, based on cryogenic temperature single
crystal XRD. This compound represents a well-characterized and valence-precise
member of a diverse family of anisotropic transition metal chalcogenides.

<h3>Anomalous scaling law for thermoelectric transport of 2D-confined  electrons in an organic molecular system</h3>

Confined electrons in low dimensions host desirable material functions for
downscaled electronics as well as advanced energy technologies.
Thermoelectricity is a most fascinating example, since the dimensionality
modifies the electron density of states dramatically, leading to enhanced
thermopower as experimentally examined in artificial two-dimensional (2D)
structures. However, it is still an open question whether such an enhanced
thermopower in low dimensions is realized in layered materials with strong 2D
characters such as cuprates. Here, we report unusual enhancement of the
thermopower in the layered organic compound $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$, where
BEDT-TTF stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene. We find that the
slope in the Jonker plot (thermopower $S$ vs. logarithm of electrical
conductivity $\log\sigma$) for $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ is significantly
larger than that of conventional semiconductors. Moreover, the large slope is
also seen in the related layered salt, demonstrating the impact of the
2D-confined carriers in the layered organics on thermoelectricity.

<h3>Topological pump of $SU(Q)$ quantum chain and Diophantine equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11646" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11646</a>

<br>
<br>
A topological pump of the $SU(Q)$ quantum chain is proposed associated with a
current due to a local $[U(1)]^{\otimes Q}$ gauge invariance of colored
fermions. The $SU(Q)$ invariant dimer phases are characterized by the $Z_Q$
Berry phases as a topological order parameter with a $d$-dimensional twist
space ($d=Q-1$) as a synthetic Brillouin zone. By inclusion of the symmetry
breaking perturbation specified by a rational parameter $\Phi=P/Q$, the pump,
that encloses around the phase boundary, is characterized by the $Q$ Chern
numbers associated with the currents due to uniform infinitesimal twists. The
analysis of the systems under the open/periodic/twisted boundary conditions
clarifies the bulk-edge correspondence of the pump where the large gauge
transformation generated by the center of mass (CoM) plays a central role. An
explicit formula for the Chern number is given by using the Diophanine
equation. Numerical demonstration by the exact diagonalization and the DMRG for
finite systems ($Q=3,4$ and $5$) have been presented to confirm the general
discussions for low energy spectra, edge states, CoM's, Chern numbers and the
bulk-edge correspondence. A modified Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type argument for the
general $SU(Q)$ quantum chain is also mentioned.

Accurate decomposition of the mixed Mn oxidation states is highly important
for characterizing the electronic structures, charge transfer, and redox
centers for electronic, electrocatalytic, and energy storage materials that
contain Mn. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) measurements of the Mn L2,3 edges are widely used for this
purpose. To date, although the measurement of the Mn L2,3 edges is
straightforward given the sample is prepared properly, an accurate
decomposition of the mix valence states of Mn remains non-trivial. For both
EELS and XAS, 2+, 3+, 4+ reference spectra need to be taken on the same
instrument/beamline and preferably in the same experimental session because the
instrumental resolution and the energy axis offset could vary from one session
to another. To circumvent this hurdle, in this study, we adopted a deep
learning approach and developed a calibration-free and reference-free method to
decompose the oxidation state of Mn L2,3 edges for both EELS and XAS. To
synthesize physics-informed and ground-truth labeled training datasets, we
created a forward model that takes into account plural scattering,
instrumentation broadening, noise, and energy axis offset. With that, we
created a 1.2 million-spectrum database with a three-element oxidation state
composition label. The library includes a sufficient variety of data including
both EELS and XAS spectra. By training on this large database, our
convolutional neural network achieves 85% accuracy on the validation dataset.
We tested the model and found it is robust against noise (down to PSNR of 10)
and plural scattering (up to t/{\lambda} = 1). We further validated the model
against spectral data that were not used in training.

A comparative study of the electrical and optical properties has been done on
3d-doped TiO$_2$. Ti$_{1-x}$M$_x$O$_2$ (M= Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn)
powder and its corresponding pellets, with doping concentration $x= 0.05$. The
samples were prepared using the solid-state route. Optical and electrical
measurements have been performed for all prepared samples and interestingly, it
is observed that due to external pressure (i.e. strain) both the properties
change significantly. A rigorous theoretical calculation has also been carried
out to verify the experimental band gap obtained from optical absorption
spectroscopy. In case of pellet sample band gap decreases as compared to the
powder sample due to variation of pressure inside the structures. Role of
doping has also been investigated both in pellet and powder forms and we found
that the band gap decreases as the atomic number of dopants increases. A
cross-over behavior is seen in pellet samples on doping with Ni, Cu and Zn
(i.e. band gap increases with an increase in the atomic number of dopant).
Electrical resistivity measurements have been carried out for both pellet and
powder samples and it is found that in the case of strained samples the value
of resistivity is smaller while in the case of strain-free samples it is quite
large. We believe that the present study suggests a novel approach for tuning
the electrical and optical properties of semiconducting oxides either from
doping or from applied pressure (or strain).

The addition of artificial pinning centers has led to an impressive increase
in critical current density ($J_{\rm c}$) in a superconductor, enabling
record-breaking all-superconducting magnets and other applications. $J_{\rm c}$
has reached $\sim 0.2$-$0.3$ $J_{\rm d}$, where $J_{\rm d}$ is the depairing
current density, and the numerical factor depends on the pinning optimization.
By modifying $\lambda$ and/or $\xi$, the penetration depth and coherence
length, respectively, we can increase $J_{\rm d}$. For
(Y$_{0.77}$Gd$_{0.23}$)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ ((Y,Gd)123) we achieve this by
controlling the carrier density, which is related to $\lambda$ and $\xi$. We
also tune $\lambda$ and $\xi$ by controlling the chemical pressure in the
Fe-based superconductors, BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ films. The variation of
$\lambda$ and $\xi$ leads to an intrinsic improvement of $J_{\rm c}$, via
$J_{\rm d}$, obtaining extremely high values of $J_{\rm c}$ of $130$ MA/cm$^2$
and $8.0$ MA/cm$^2$ at $4.2$ K, consistent with an enhancement of $J_{\rm d}$
of a factor of $2$ for both incoherent nanoparticle-doped (Y,Gd)123 coated
conductors (CCs) and BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ films, showing that this new
material design is useful to achieving high critical current densities for a
wide array of superconductors. The remarkably high vortex-pinning force in
combination with this thermodynamic and pinning optimization route for the
(Y,Gd)123 CCs reached $\sim 3.17$ TN/m$^3$ at $4.2$ K and 18 T (${\bf
H}\parallel c$), the highest values ever reported in any superconductor.

<i>D. M. Gokhfeld, S. V. Semenov, M. I. Petrov, I. V. Nemtsev, D. A. Balaev</i>
<br>
<br>
A misalignment of anisotropic crystallites causes small values of anisotropy
and decreases the critical current density of textured polycrystalline
superconductors. To relate the crystallite misalignment and out-plane
anisotropy, the magnetic properties of the textured Bi2223 polycrystalline
superconductor were investigated. A distribution of orientation angles of
crystallites was determined using different data: scanning electron microscopy
images and hysteresis magnetization loops when an external magnetic field was
applied at different angles with respect to the texturing plane of the sample.
It was demonstrated that the standard deviation of the distribution and the
magnetic disorder angle of crystallites in textured samples can be determined
from the magnetization data in perpendicular directions. These data may be
either the irreversible magnetization measured for two different orientations
of the sample or the simultaneously measured magnetization projections parallel
and perpendicular to the magnetic field.

<br>
We demonstrate that the photo-electron counting rate, $P^{(2)}$, measured in
two electron coincidence spectroscopy (2$e$-ARPES) experiments, provides
unprecedented insight into the nature of topological superconductivity. In
particular, we show that the spin dependence of $P^{(2)}$ allows one to detect
superconducting spin-triplet correlations that are induced in a topological
superconductor even in the absence of an associated triplet superconducting
order parameter. This ability to detect spin-triplet correlations allows one to
distinguish between two recently proposed scenarios for the microscopic origin
of topological superconductivity in FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$. Finally, we show
that $P^{(2)}$ exhibits a characteristic intensity maximum that can be employed
to detect topological phase transitions.

<h3>Beyond ab initio reaction simulator: an application to GaN metalorganic  vapor phase epitaxy</h3>

<br>
<br>
To develop a quantitative reaction simulator, data assimilation was performed
using high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) data applied to
GaN metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy system. Incorporating ab initio knowledge
into the optimization successfully reproduces not only the concentration of
CH$_4$ (an impurity precursor) as an objective variable but also known reaction
pathways. The simulation results show significant production of GaH$_3$, a
precursor of GaN, which has been difficult to detect in TOF-MS experiments. Our
proposed approach is expected to be applicable to other applied physics fields
that require quantitative prediction that goes beyond ab initio reaction rates.

<h3>Flow of lubricated granular material on an inclined plane</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have studied the gravity driven flow of spherical shaped, millimetric
sized granular material coated with aspherical, micron-sized, near frictionless
lubricant particles. Experiments were performed on an inclined plane using two
different sized particles for varying concentrations of the lubricant. The
particle volumetric flow rate exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with increasing
lubricant concentration. It shows an increase at lower lubricant concentration
followed by a decrease at higher lubricant concentration. The lubricant
particles adhere to the granular particle surface thereby reducing the
inter-particle friction. However, presence of lubricant particles at higher
concentration damps out inter-particle collision thereby reducing the
interparticle momentum transfer. Non-monotonicity in the observed behavior is
then conjectured to arise due to competing effects of inter-particle friction
and inter-particle collision. The present work and the overall observed
behavior therein provides a simple experimental system to characterize the
effects of added lubricant material in pharmaceutical and other relevant
industrial applications.

Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum spin systems is an
emergent topic of modern condensed matter physics. Quantum dynamics can be
described by particle-like carriers of information, known-as quasiparticles
that appear from the collective behaviour of the underlying system. Spinon
excitations, governing the excitations of quantum spin-systems, have been
accurately calculated and precisely verified experimentally for the
antiferromagnetic chain model. However, identification and characterization of
novel quasiparticles emerging from the topological excitations of the spin
system having periodic exchange interactions are yet to be obtained. Here, we
report the identification of emergent composite excitations of the novel
quasiparticles doublons and quartons in spin-1/2 trimer-chain antiferromagnet
Na2Cu3Ge4O12 (having periodic intrachain exchange interactions J1-J1-J2) and
its topologically protected quantum 1/3 magnetization-plateau state. The
characteristic energies, dispersion relations, and dynamical structure factor
of neutron scattering as well as macroscopic quantum 1/3 magnetization-plateau
state are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art dynamical density matrix
renormalization group calculations.

<h3>Stabilization of superconductivity by metamagnetism in an easy-axis  magnetic field on UTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Influence of metamagnetism on superconductivity is studied for the field
along an easy $a$-axis by AC magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and
magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in UTe$_2$. The improvement of crystal quality
leads to an upward curvature of $T_c$($B$) above 6 T, that results in a largely
enhanced upper critical field of 12 T. The entropy analysis also shows a
metamagnetic crossover around 6 T. The sharp negative peak in MCE below $T_c$
indicates that the crossover becomes a transition of first-order character in
the superconducting state. Our results shows that metamagnetism induces a
transition inside the superconducting phase and stabilizes the
superconductivity for the field along the easy axis.

<br>
<br>
Competition among exchange interactions is able to induce novel spin
correlations on a bipartite lattice without geometrical frustration. A
prototype example is the spiral spin liquid, which is a correlated paramagnetic
state characterized by sub-dimensional degenerate propagation vectors. Here,
using spectral graph theory, we show that spiral spin liquids on a bipartite
lattice can be approximated by a further-neighbor model on the corresponding
line-graph lattice that is non-bipartite, thus broadening the space of
candidate materials that may support the spiral spin liquid phases. As
illustrations, we examine neutron scattering experiments performed on two
spinel compounds, ZnCr$_2$Se$_4$ and CuInCr$_4$Se$_8$, to demonstrate the
feasibility of this new approach and expose its possible limitations in
experimental realizations.

The development of CdMgO ternary alloy with a single cubic phase is
challenging but meaningful work for technological advancement. In this work, we
have grown a series of Cd1-xMgxO ternary random alloys with various Mg
concentrations (x = 0, 30, 32, 45, and 55%) on quartz substrate by
plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) technique. The structural
investigations of alloys were performed using the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
technique. The decreases in average crystallite size and lattice parameters
were observed with an increase in Mg content in the alloys. XRD analysis
confirms a single cubic phase is obtained for alloy compositions. The elemental
and morphological studies were carried out using energy dispersive x-ray (EDX)
spectroscopy and atomic force microscope (AFM) technique, respectively. The
optical investigation was carried out using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The optical
bandgaps were estimated using the Tauc relation and it was varied from 2.34 eV
to 3.47 eV by varying the Mg content from zero to 55% in the alloys. The Urbach
energy increases from 112 meV to 350 meV which suggests a more disordered
localized state with an increase in Mg incorporation in the alloys.

We analyze the power spectral density of a signal composed of non-overlapping

density of a signal constructed from the sequence of non-overlapping pulses.
Then we perform a detailed analysis of the rectangular pulse case. We show that
pure $1/f$ noise can be observed until extremely low frequencies when the
characteristic pulse duration is long in comparison to the characteristic gap
duration. Otherwise, perverted $1/f$ noise is observed.

<h3>Spin-Dependent High-Order Topological Insulator and Two Types of  Distinct Corner Modes in Monolayer FeSe/GdClO Heterostructure</h3>

<i>Qing Wang, Rui Song, Ning Hao</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose that a spin-dependent second-order topological insulator can be
realized in monolayer FeSe/GdClO heterostructure, in which substrate GdClO
helps to stabilize and enhance the antiferromagnetic order in FeSe. The
second-order topological insulator is free from spin-orbit coupling and
in-plane magnetic field. We also find that there exist two types of distinct
corner modes residing in intersections of two ferromagnetic edges and two
antiferromagnetic edges, respectively. The underlying physics for ferromagnetic
corner mode follows a sublattice-chirality-kink picture. More interestingly,
ferromagnetic corner mode shows spin-dependent property, which is also robust
against spin-orbit coupling. Unexpectedly, antiferromagnetic corner mode can be
taken as a typical emergent and hierarchical phenomenon from an array of
ferromagnetic corner modes. Remarkably, antiferromagnetic corner modes violate
general kink picture and can be understood as bound states of a one-dimensional
Schrodinger equation under a connected potential well. Our findings not only
provide a promising second-order topological insulator in electronic materials,
but uncover some new properties of corner modes in high-order topological
insulator.

<h3>Diffusion Monte Carlo using domains in configuration space</h3>

<br>
<br>
The sampling of the configuration space in diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is
done using walkers moving randomly. In a previous work on the Hubbard model
[\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.60.2299}{Assaraf et al.~Phys.~Rev.~B
\textbf{60}, 2299 (1999)}], it was shown that the probability for a walker to
stay a certain amount of time in the same state obeys a Poisson law and that
the on-state dynamics can be integrated out exactly, leading to an effective
dynamics connecting only different states. Here, we extend this idea to the
general case of a walker trapped within domains of arbitrary shape and size.
The equations of the resulting effective stochastic dynamics are derived. The
larger the average (trapping) time spent by the walker within the domains, the
greater the reduction in statistical fluctuations. A numerical application to
the Hubbard model is presented. Although this work presents the method for
finite linear spaces, it can be generalized without fundamental difficulties to
continuous configuration spaces.

<br>
One of the key problems in valleytronics is to realize valley polarization.
Ferrovalley (FV) semiconductor and half-valley-metal (HVM) have been proposed,
which possess intrinsic spontaneous valley polarization. Here, we propose the
concept of quasi-half-valley-metal (QHVM), including electron and hole carriers
with only a type of carriers being valley polarized. The QHVM may realize
separation function of electron and hole. A concrete example of
$\mathrm{VGe_2P_4}$ monolayer is used to illustrate our proposal through the
first-principle calculations. To better realize QHVM, the electric field is
applied to tune related valley properties of $\mathrm{VGe_2P_4}$. Within
considered electric field range, $\mathrm{VGe_2P_4}$ is always ferromagnetic
(FM) ground state, which possesses out-of-plane magnetization by calculating
magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) including magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA) and
magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energies. These out-of-plane FM properties
guarantee intrinsic spontaneous valley polarization in $\mathrm{VGe_2P_4}$.
Within a certain range of electric field, the QHVM can be maintained, and the
related polarization properties can be effectively tuned. Our works pave the
way toward two-dimensional (2D) functional materials design of valleytronics.

<i>Jiaju Zhang, M. A. Rajabpour</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a truncation method to calculate the trace distance between two
Gaussian states in fermionic systems. The Gaussian states are fully determined
by their corresponding correlation matrices. To calculate the trace distance
between two Gaussian states, we truncate the corresponding correlation matrices
according to the von Neumann entropies and the difference of the two
correlation matrices. We find two classes of cases for which the method works.
The first class are the cases that the von Neumann entropies of the two states
are not too large and the two corresponding correlation matrices nearly
commute. The other class are the cases that the two states are nearly
orthogonal in the way that are characterized by the canonical values of the
correlation matrix difference. We apply the method to examples of subsystems in
eigenstates of Ising and XX spin chains, and when the method works we obtain
the subsystem trace distances with considerably large subsystem sizes.

<i>Tommaso Cea</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the inter-valley scattering induced by the repulsive Coulomb
interaction as a purely electronic mechanism for the origin of
superconductivity in few layers of graphene. This mechanism allows for the
formation of valley-singlet/spin-triplet Cooper pairs and it is strongly
favored by the presence of singularities in the density of states (DOS), the
van Hove singularities, which are triggered by the flattening of the electronic
bands. We consider three different hetherostructures based on graphene: twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG), rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) and Bernal bilayer
graphene (BBG), where van Hove scenarios can be realized by tuning the twist
angles and/or the elctronic density and/or an applied displacement field. Our
results provide trends and estimates of the superconducting (SC) critical
temperature in agreement with the experimental observations, thus identifying
the inter-valley Coulomb scattering as a universal driving mechanism for the
superconductivity observed so far in few layers of graphene. Our model is quite
general and can be used to characterize and predict the SC transition in a wide
variety of novel materials, obtained by engineering twists and stacks in
multilayers of graphene.

<br>
We investigate the elasticity of unsupported epithelial monolayer and we
discover that unlike a thin solid plate, which wrinkles if geometrically
incompatible with the underlying substrate, the epithelium may do so even in
absence of the substrate. From a cell-based model, we derive an exact
elasticity theory and discover wrinkling driven by the differential apico-basal
surface tension. Our theory can be mapped onto that for solid plates by
introducing a phantom substrate whose stiffness is finite beyond a critical
differential tension. This suggests a new mechanism for an autonomous control
of tissues over the length scale of their surface patterns.

Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have shown evidence of robust hot carrier
effects due to their small dimensions. The relaxation dynamics of hot carriers
in these nanostructures, generated by photo-absorption, are of great importance
in optoelectronic devices and high efficiency solar cells, such as hot carrier
solar cells. Among various III-V semiconductors, indium arsenide (InAs) NWs are
promising candidates for their applications in advanced light harvesting
devices due to their high photo-absorptivity and high mobility. Here, we
investigate the hot carrier dynamics in InAs-AlAsSb core-shell NWs, as well as
bare-core InAs NWs, using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy with widely tuned
pump and probe energies. We have found a lifetime of 2.3 ps for longitudinal
optical (LO) phonons and hot electron lifetimes of about 3 ps and 30 ps for
carrier-carrier interactions and electron-phonon interactions, respectively. In
addition, we have investigated the electronic states in the AlAsSb-shell and
found that, despite the large band offset of the core-shell design in the
conduction band, excited carriers remain in the shell longer than 100 ps. Our
results indicate evidence of plasmon-tailored core-shell NWs for efficient
light harvesting devices, which could open potential avenues for improving the
efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells.

<br>
<br>
Noise induced decoherence is one of the main threats to large-scale quantum
computation. In an attempt to assess the noise affecting a qubit we go beyond
the standard steady-state solution of the transmission through a qubit-coupled
cavity in input-output theory by including dynamical noise in the description
of the system. We solve the quantum Langevin equations exactly for a noise-free
system and treat the noise as a perturbation. In the long-time limit the
corrections may be written as a sum of convolutions of the noise power spectral
density with an integration kernel that depends on external control parameters.
Using the convolution theorem, we invert the corrections and obtain relations
for the noise spectral density as an integral over measurable quantities.
Additionally, we treat the noise exactly in the dispersive regime, and again
find that noise characteristics are imprinted in the long-time transmission in
convolutions containing the power spectral density.

The recent advancement in two-dimensional (2D) materials-based quantum
confinement has provided an opportunity to investigate and manipulate electron
transport for quantum applications. However, the issues of metal/semiconductor
interface effects create a hurdle to realize the artificial fabrication of the
quantum dot and study the quantum transport. Here, we utilize the strategy of
employing the semimetal for Ohmic contacts with transition metal
dichalcogenides especially, multilayer MoS2 and successfully fabricate the
MoS2-Bi based FET devices. We observe the Ohmic behavior in the MoS2-Bi devices
at cryogenic temperatures 4.2, 2.3 and 0.4 K. We also utilize intrinsic
Schottky barriers formed at the interface between MoS2 and Au for the gate
electrodes to form and control quantum dots. We observed Coulomb diamonds in
MoS2 devices at cryogenic temperature. Our results of quantum transport in MoS2
could serve as a stepping stone for investigating novel quantum effects such as
spin-valley coupling and the manipulation of qubit systems.

We present a concrete theoretical proposal for detecting topological phase
transitions in double kicked atom-optics kicked rotors with internal spin-1/2
degree of freedom. The implementation utilizes a kicked Bose-Einstein
condensate evolving in one-dimensional momentum space. To reduce influence of
atom loss and phase decoherence we aim to keep experimental durations short
while maintaining a resonant experimental protocol. Experimental limitations
induced by phase noise, quasimomentum distributions, symmetries, and the
AC-Stark shift are considered. Our results thus suggest a feasible and
optimized procedure for observing topological phase transitions in quantum
kicked rotors.

We consider the superfluid weight, speed of sound and excitation fraction of

The superfluid weight is calculated by introducing a phase winding and
minimizing the free energy with respect to it. We find that the superfluid
weight has a contribution arising from the change of the condensate density and
chemical potential upon the phase twist that has been neglected in the previous
literature. We also point out that the speed of sound and the excitation
fraction are proportional to orbital-position-independent generalizations of
the quantum metric and the quantum distance, and reduce to the usual quantum
metric (Fubini-Study metric) and the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance only in
special cases. We derive a second order perturbation correction to the
dependence of the speed of sound on the generalized quantum metric, and show
that it compares well with numerical calculations. Our results provide a
consistent connection between flat band BEC and quantum geometry, with physical
observables being independent of the orbital positions as they should, and
complete formulas for the evaluation of the superfluid weight within the
Bogoliubov theory. We discuss the limitations of the Bogoliubov theory in
evaluating the superfluid weight.

<br>
<br>
We employ a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) cooled to millikelvin
temperatures by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) to perform
scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) on an atomically clean surface of
Al(100) in a superconducting state using normal-metal and superconducting STM
tips. Varying the ADR temperatures between 30 mK and 1.2 K, we show that the
temperature of the STM junction $T$ is decoupled from the temperature of the
surrounding environment $T_{\mathrm{env}}$. Simulating the STS data with the
$P(E)$ theory, we determine that $T_{\mathrm{env}} \approx 1.5$ K, while the
fitting of the superconducting gap spectrum yields the lowest $T=77$ mK.

<i>Elton Pan, Christopher Karpovich, Elsa Olivetti</i>
<br>
<br>
A major obstacle to the realization of novel inorganic materials with
desirable properties is the inability to perform efficient optimization across
both materials properties and synthesis of those materials. In this work, we
propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to inverse inorganic materials
design, which can identify promising compounds with specified properties and
synthesizability constraints. Our model learns chemical guidelines such as
charge and electronegativity neutrality while maintaining chemical diversity
and uniqueness. We demonstrate a multi-objective RL approach, which can
generate novel compounds with targeted materials properties including formation
energy and bulk/shear modulus alongside a lower sintering temperature synthesis
objectives. Using this approach, the model can predict promising compounds of
interest, while suggesting an optimized chemical design space for inorganic
materials discovery.

<h3>Volume-to-Area Law Entanglement Transition in a non-Hermitian Free  Fermionic Chain</h3>

<br>
<i>Youenn Le Gal, Xhek Turkeshi, Marco Schirò</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the dynamics of the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
arising as the no-click limit of a continuously monitored free fermion chain
where particles and holes are measured on two sublattices. The model has
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, which we show to spontaneously break as a function of
the strength of measurement backaction, resulting in a spectral transition
where quasiparticles acquire a finite lifetime in patches of the Brillouin
zone. We compute the entanglement entropy's dynamics in the thermodynamic limit
and demonstrate an entanglement transition between volume-law and area-law
scaling, which we characterize analytically. Interestingly we show that the
entanglement transition and the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking do not
coincide, the former occurring when the entire decay spectrum of the
quasiparticle becomes gapped.

<br>
<i>Masoud Bahari, Song-Bo Zhang, Chang-An Li, Sang-Jun Choi, Carsten Timm, Björn Trauzettel</i>
<br>
<br>
We discover a new type of helical topological superconductivity away from the
Fermi surface in three-dimensional time-reversal-symmetric odd-parity multiband
superconductors. In this case, pairing between electrons originating from
different bands is responsible for the corresponding topological phase
transition. Consequently, a pair of helical topological Dirac surface states
emerges at finite excitation energies. These helical Dirac surface states are
tunable in energy by chemical potential and band splitting strength. They are
protected by pseudospin-rotational symmetry. We suggest materials in which this
phenomenon could be observed.

The interplay between unitary dynamics and local quantum measurements results
in unconventional non-unitary dynamical phases and transitions. In this paper
we investigate the dynamics of $(d+1)$-dimensional hybrid stabilizer circuits,
for $d=1,2,3$. We characterize the measurement-induced phases and their
transitions using large-scale numerical simulations focusing on entanglement
measures, purification dynamics, and wave-function structure. Our findings
demonstrate the measurement-induced transition in $(d+1)$ spatiotemporal
dimensions is conformal and close to the percolation transition in $(d+1)$
spatial dimensions.

<h3>The role of multiplicative noise in critical dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Nathan O. Silvano, Daniel G. Barci</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the role of multiplicative stochastic processes in the description
of the dynamics of an order parameter near a critical point. We study
equilibrium, as well as, out-of-equilibrium properties. By means of a
functional formalism, we built the Dynamical Renormalization Group equations
for a real scalar order parameter with $Z_2$ symmetry, driven by a class o
multiplicative stochastic processes with the same symmetry. We have computed
the flux diagram, using a controlled $\epsilon$-expansion, up to order
$\epsilon^2$. We have found that, for dimensions $d=4-\epsilon$, the additive
dynamic fixed point is unstable. The flux runs to a {\em multiplicative fixed
point} driven by a diffusion function $G(\phi)=1+g^*\phi^2({\bf x})/2$, where
$\phi$ is the order parameter and $g^*=\epsilon^2/18$ is the fixed point value
of the multiplicative noise coupling constant. We show that, even though the
position of the fixed point depends on the stochastic prescription, the
critical exponents do not. Therefore, different dynamics driven by different
stochastic prescriptions (such as It\^o, Stratonovich, anti-It\^o and so on)
are in the same universality class.

<h3>Convex entropy production for fast and weak drivings</h3>

<i>Pierre Nazé</i>
<br>
<br>
Knowing if an optimal solution is local or global has always been a hard
question to answer in more sophisticated situations of optimization problems.
In this work, for fast and weak driving processes, we show the existence of a
unique global optimal protocol for entropy production. We prove that by showing
its convexity as a functional in the control parameter. This property also
proves its monotonicity in such context, in contrast with our previous results
where the entropy production rate is not necessarily positive for all times. In
the end, we exemplify that the analytical technique used in our previous work
[Journal of Physics Communications 6, 083001 (2022)] delivers the global
optimal protocol, by comparing it with the results of the global optimization
technique of genetic programming.

<br>
<br>
Spin waves are proposed as information carriers for next-generation computing
devices because of their low power consumption. Moreover, their wave-like
nature allows for novel computing paradigms. Conventional methods to detect
spin waves are based either on electrical induction, limiting the downscaling
and efficiency complicating eventual implementation, or on light scattering,
where the minimum detectable spin-wave wavelength is set by the wavelength of
the laser. In this Article we demonstrate magneto-optical detection of spin
waves beyond the diffraction limit using a metallic grating that selectively
absorbs laser light. Specifically, we demonstrate the detection of propagating
spin waves with a wavelength of 700 nm using a diffraction-limited laser spot
with a size of 10 $\mu$m in 20 nm thick Py strips. Additionally, we show that
this grating is selective to the wavelength of the spin wave, providing
wavevector-selective spin-wave detection. This should open up new avenues
towards the integration of the burgeoning fields of photonics and magnonics,
and aid in the optical detection of spin waves in the short-wavelength exchange
regime for fundamental research.

<br>
Ground-state properties, such as energies and double occupancies, of a
one-dimensional two-band Hubbard model are calculated using a first principles
Gutzwiller conjugate gradient minimization theory. The favorable agreement with
the results from the density matrix renormalization group theory demonstrates
the accuracy of our method. A rotationally invariant approach is further
incorporated into the method to greatly reduce the computational complexity
with a speedup of 300 times. Moreover, we investigate the Mott transition
between a metal and a Mott insulator by evaluating the charge gap. With greatly
reduced computational effort, our method reproduces the phase diagram in
reasonable agreement with the density matrix renormalization group theory.

<h3>Ferromagnetic domains in the large-$U$ Hubbard model with a few holes:  an FCIQMC study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12049</a>
<br>
<i>Sujun Yun, Werner Dobrautz, Hongjun Luo, Vamshi Katukuri, Niklas Libermann, Ali Alavi</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional Hubbard lattices with two or three holes are investigated as
a function of $U$ in the large-$U$ limit. In the so-called Nagaoka limit
(one-hole system at infinite $U$), it is known that the Hubbard model exhibits
a ferromagnetic ground-state. Here, by means of exact FCIQMC simulations
applied to periodic lattices up to 24 sites, we compute spin-spin correlation
functions as a function of increasing $U$. The correlation functions clearly
demonstrate the onset of ferromagnetic domains, centred on individual holes.
The overall total spin of the wavefunctions remain the lowest possible (0, or
$\frac{1}{2}$, depending on the number of holes). The ferromagnetic domains
appear at interaction strengths comparable to the critical interaction
strengths of the Nagaoka transition in finite systems with strictly one hole.
The existence of such ferromagnetic domains is the signature of Nagaoka physics
in Hubbard systems with a small (but greater than one) number of holes.

<h3>Easy-plane antiferromagnet in tilted field: gap in magnon spectrum and  susceptibility</h3>

<br>
<i>Artemiy S. Sherbakov, Oleg I. Utesov</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experimental data on dichloro-tetrakis thiourea-nickel
(DTN) [T.A. Soldatov $\textit{et al}$, Phys. Rev. B ${\bf 101}$, 104410
(2020)], a model of antiferromagnet on a tetragonal lattice with single-ion
easy-plane anisotropy in the tilted external magnetic field is considered.
Using the smallness of the in-plane field component, we analytically address
field dependence of the energy gap in ``acoustic'' magnon mode and transverse
uniform magnetic susceptibility in the ordered phase. It is shown that the
former is non-monotonic due to quantum fluctuations, which was indeed observed
experimentally. The latter is essentially dependent on the ``optical'' magnon
rate of decay on two magnons. At magnetic fields close to the one which
corresponds to the center of the ordered phase, it leads to experimentally
observed dynamical diamagnetism phenomenon.

<h3>Ground states of Heisenberg spin clusters from a cluster-based projected  Hartree-Fock approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12069</a>
<br>
<i>Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Carlos A. Jiménez-Hoyos</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent work on approximating ground states of Heisenberg spin clusters by
projected Hartree-Fock theory (PHF) is extended to a cluster-based ansatz
(cPHF). Whereas PHF variationally optimizes a site-spin product state for the
restoration of spin- and point-group symmetry, cPHF groups sites into discrete
clusters and uses a cluster-product state as the broken-symmetry reference.
Intracluster correlation is thus already included at the mean-field level and
intercluster correlation is introduced through symmetry projection. Variants of
cPHF differing in the broken and restored symmetries are evaluated for ground
states and singlet-triplet gaps of antiferromagnetic spin rings for various
cluster sizes, where cPHF in general affords a significant improvement over
ordinary PHF, although the division into clusters lowers the cyclical symmetry.
On the other hand, certain two- or three-dimensional spin arrangements permit
cluster groupings compatible with the full spatial symmetry. We accordingly
demonstrate that cPHF yields approximate ground states with correct spin and
point-group quantum numbers for honeycomb lattice fragments and symmetric
polyhedra.

<br>
<br>
Optoelectronic properties of van der Waals homostructures can be selectively
engineered by the relative twist angle between layers. Here, we study the
twist-dependent moire coupling in MoSe2 homobilayers. For small angles, we find
a pronounced redshift of the K-K and {\Gamma}-K excitons accompanied by a
transition from K-K to {\Gamma}-K emission. Both effects can be traced back to
the underlying moire pattern in the MoSe2 homobilayers, as confirmed by our
low-energy continuum model for different moire excitons. We identify two
distinct intralayer moire excitons for R-stacking, while H-stacking yields two
degenerate intralayer excitons due to inversion symmetry. In both cases, bright
interlayer excitons are found at higher energies. The performed calculations
are in excellent agreement with experiment and allow us to characterize the
observed exciton resonances, providing insight about the layer composition and
relevant stacking configuration of different moire exciton species.

<br>
<br>
Although theoretical modelling and inelastic neutron scattering measurements
have indicated the presence of topological magnon bands in multiple quantum
magnets, experiments remain unable to detect signal of magnon thermal Hall
effect in the quantum magnets, which is a consequence of magnons condensation
at the bottom of the bands following Bose Eienstein statistics as well as the
concentration of Berry curvature at the higher energies. In a recent work, Malz
et al. have shown that topological magnons in edge states in a finite sample
can be amplified using tailored electromagnetic fields. We extend their
approach by showing that uniform electromagnetic field can selectively amplify
magnons with finite Berry curvature by breaking inversion symmetry of a
lattice. Using this approach, we demonstrate the generation of bulk topological
magnons in a Heisenberg ferromagnet on the breathing kagome lattice and the
consequent amplification of thermal Hall effect.

<i>Federico Rottoli, Sara Murciano, Erik Tonni, Pasquale Calabrese</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the ground-state entanglement Hamiltonian of several disjoint
intervals for the massless Dirac fermion on the half-line. Its structure
consists of a local part and a bi-local term that couples each point to another
one in each other interval. The bi-local operator can be either diagonal or
mixed in the fermionic chiralities and it is sensitive to the boundary
conditions. The knowledge of such entanglement Hamiltonian is the starting
point to evaluate the negativity Hamiltonian, i.e. the logarithm of the
partially transposed reduced density matrix, which is an operatorial
characterisation of entanglement of subsystems in a mixed states. We find that
the negativity Hamiltonian inherits the structure of the corresponding
entanglement Hamiltonian. We finally show how the continuum expressions for
both these operators can be recovered from exact numerical computations in
free-fermion chains.

Pristine graphene is not suitable for hydrogen storage at ambient conditions
since it binds the hydrogen molecules only by van der Waals interactions.
However, the adsorption energy of the hydrogen molecules can be improved by
doping or decorating metal atoms on the graphene monolayer. The doping and
decoration processes are challenging due to the oxygen interference in hydrogen
adsorption and the clustering issue of metal atoms. To improve the hydrogen
adsorption energy in pristine graphene, we have explored the hydrogen storage
capabilities of graphene monolayer in the presence of compressive strain. We
found that at 6 % of biaxial compressive strain, a 4*4*1 supercell of graphene
can adsorb 10 H$_2$ molecules above the graphene surface. The average binding
energy of H$_2$ for this configuration is found to be -0.42 eV/H$_2$, which is
very suitable for reversible hydrogen adsorption. We propose that a 4*4*1
supercell of graphene can adsorb a total number of 20 H$_2$ molecules leading
to a high hydrogen uptake of 9.4 %. The interaction between orbitals of carbon
and hydrogen atoms and the charge transfer process have been studied by
plotting the partial density of states and surface charge density plots. The
electronic density around the C-C bonds of graphene increases in the presence
of compressive strain, due to which hydrogen molecules are strongly adsorbed.

crystallized in a hexagonal $\mathrm{HfFe_6Ge_6}$-type structure, highlighted
by the stacking of triangular ytterbium sublattice and kagome vanadium
sublattice. Above 2 K, $\mathrm{YbV_6Sn_6}$ shows typical HF properties due to
the Kondo effect on the Kramers doublet of $\mathrm{Yb^{3+}}$ ions in crystal
electric field. A remarkable magnetic ordering occurs at $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ =
0.40 K in zero field while a weak external field suppresses the ordering and
induces non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior. In strong magnetic field the compound
shows a heavy Fermi liquid state. $\mathrm{YbV_6Sn_6}$ presents as one of the
few examples of Yb-based HF compounds hosting triangular Kondo lattice on which
a magnetic field induces quantum criticality near zero temperature.

It is customary to use arrays of superconducting quantum interference devices
(SQUIDs) for implementing magnetic field-tunable inductors. Here, we
demonstrate an equivalent tunability in a (SQUID-free) array of single
Al/AlOx/Al Josephson tunnel junctions. With the proper choice of junction
geometry, a perpendicularly applied magnetic field bends along the plane of the
superconductor and focuses into the tunnel barrier region due to a
demagnetization effect. Consequently, the Josephson inductance can be
efficiently modulated by the Fraunhoffer-type supercurrent interference. The
elimination of SQUIDs not only simplifies the device design and fabrication,
but also facilitates a denser packing of junctions and, hence, a higher
inductance per unit length. As an example, we demonstrate a transmission line,
the wave impedance of which is field-tuned in the range of
$4-8~\textrm{k}\Omega$, centered around the important value of the resistance
quantum $h/(2e)^2 \approx 6.5~\textrm{k}\Omega$.

Numerical approaches to the correlated electron problem have achieved
considerable success, yet are still constrained by several bottlenecks,
including high order polynomial or exponential scaling in system size, long
autocorrelation times, challenges in recognizing novel phases, and the Fermion
sign problem. Methods in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence, and
data science promise to help address these limitations and open up a new
frontier in strongly correlated quantum system simulations. In this paper, we
review some of the progress in this area. We begin by examining these
approaches in the context of classical models, where their underpinnings and
application can be easily illustrated and benchmarked. We then discuss cases
where ML methods have enabled scientific discovery. Finally, we will examine
their applications in accelerating model solutions in state-of-the-art quantum
many-body methods like quantum Monte Carlo and discuss potential future
research directions.

Local and nonlocal differential resistance measurements on Hall bars defined
in AlO$_x$/KTaO$_3$ heterostructures show anomalous behavior that depends on
the crystal orientation and the applied back gate voltage. The local
differential resistance is asymmetric in the dc bias current, with an
antisymmetric component that grows with decreasing gate voltage. More
surprisingly, a large nonlocal differential resistance is observed that extends
between measurement probes that are separated by 100s of microns. The potential
source of this anomalous behavior is discussed.
