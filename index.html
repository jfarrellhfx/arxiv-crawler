<h3>A many-body Szilard engine with giant number fluctuations</h3>

Szilard's engine, a model machine that converts information to work, is one
of the cornerstones of the thermodynamics of information. We report on an
experimental realization of a macroscopic many-particle Szilard engine.
Crucially, the working substance of this engine consists of several active,
self-propelling particles that exhibit giant number fluctuations. We find that
the work per cycle that can be extracted from this engine is proportional to
number fluctuations in a system where pressure depends monotonically on
density. The differences between active and nonactive particles reveal
themselves through the dependence of the mean work per cycle on the number of
particles.

<h3>Stability conditions for a large anharmonic bipolaron</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11632</a>

A large polaron is a quasiparticle that consists of a nearly free electron
interacting with the phonons of a material, whose lattice parameters are much
smaller than the polaron scale. The electron-phonon interaction also leads to
an attractive interaction between electrons, which can allow two polarons to
pair up and form a bipolaron. It has been shown that large bipolarons can form
in theory due to strong 1-electron-1-phonon coupling, but they have not been
seen in real materials because the critical value of the required
electron-phonon interaction is too large. Here, we investigate the effect of
1-electron-2-phonon coupling on the large bipolaron problem.
Starting from a generalization of the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian that includes
both the standard 1-electron-1-phonon interaction as well as an anharmonic
1-electron-2-phonon interaction, we use the path integral method to find a
semi-analytical upper bound for the bipolaron energy that is valid at all
values of the Fr\"ohlich coupling strength $\alpha$. We find the bipolaron
phase diagram and conditions for the bipolaron stability by comparing the
bipolaron energy to the energy of two free polarons. The critical value of the
Fr\"ohlich coupling strength $\alpha_{\text{crit}}$ is calculated as a function
of the strength of the 1-electron-2-phonon interaction. The results suggest
that large bipolaron formation is more likely in materials with significant
1-electron-2-phonon interaction as well as strong 1-electron-1-phonon
interaction, such as strontium titanate.

<h3>Quantum-classical correspondence of strongly chaotic many-body spin  models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10451" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10451</a>
<br>
<i>Luis Benet, Fausto Borgonovi, Felix M. Izrailev, Lea F. Santos</i>

We study the quantum-classical correspondence for systems with interacting
spin-particles that are strongly chaotic in the classical limit. This is done
in the presence of constants of motion associated with the fixed angular
momenta of individual spins. Our analysis of the Lyapunov spectra reveals that
the largest Lyapunov exponent agrees with the Lyapunov exponent that determines
the local instability of each individual spin moving under the influence of all
other spins. Within this picture, we introduce a rigorous and simple test of
ergodicity for the spin motion, and use it to identify when classical chaos is
both strong and global in phase space. In the quantum domain, our analysis of
the Hamiltonian matrix in a proper representation allows us to obtain the
conditions for the onset of quantum chaos as a function of the model
parameters. From the comparison between the quantum and classical domains, we
demonstrate that quantum quantities, such as the local density of states (LDOS)
and the shape of the chaotic eigenfunctions written in the non-interacting
many-body basis, have well-defined classical counterparts. Another central
finding is the relationship between the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and the width
of the LDOS, which is useful for studies of many-body dynamics.

<h3>Spin density wave, Fermi liquid, and fractionalized phases in a theory  of antiferromagnetic metals using paramagnons and bosonic spinons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10452" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10452</a>

<br>
<br>
The pseudogap metal phase of the hole-doped cuprates can be described by
small Fermi surfaces of electron-like quasiparticles, which enclose a volume
violating the Luttinger relation. This violation requires the existence of
additional fractionalized excitations which can be viewed as fractionalized
remnants of the paramagnon. We fractionalize the paramagnon into bosonic
spinons, and present a gauge theory of bosonic spinons, a Higgs field, and an
ancilla layer of fermions coupled to the original electrons. Along with the
small Fermi surface metal, this theory displays conventional phases: the Fermi
liquid with a low-energy paramagnon mode, and phases with spin density wave
order. We follow the evolution of the electronic photoemission spectrum across
these quantum phase transitions. We consider both the two-sublattice N\'eel and
incommensurate spin density wave phases.

<h3>Fractionalized Prethermalization in a Driven Quantum Spin Liquid</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating
non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized
quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and
examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We
uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized
prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly
different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this
peculiar prethermalization behavior can be used as a probe of fractionalized
quantum spin liquids. To this end, we discuss an experimentally feasible
protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state with a low energy density,
which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum
information processing platforms.

<h3>Gapless Infinite-component Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10458" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10458</a>

The infinite-component Chern-Simons-Maxwell (iCSM) theory is a 3+1D
generalization of the 2+1D Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory by including an infinite
number of coupled gauge fields. It can be used to describe interesting 3+1D
systems. In Phys. Rev. B 105, 195124 (2022), it was used to construct gapped
fracton models both within and beyond the foliation framework. In this paper,
we study the nontrivial features of gapless iCSM theories. In particular, we
find that while gapless 2+1D Maxwell theories are confined and not robust due
to monopole effect, gapless iCSM theories are deconfined and robust against all
local perturbation and hence represent a robust 3+1D deconfined gapless order.
The gaplessness of the gapless iCSM theory can be understood as a consequence
of the spontaneous breaking of an exotic one-form symmetry. Moreover, for a
subclass of the gapless iCSM theories, we find interesting topological features
in the correlation and response of the system. Finally, for this subclass of
theories, we propose a fully continuous field theory description of the model
that captures all these features.

<h3>Flocking of two unfriendly species: The two-species Vicsek model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10494" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10494</a>
<br>
<i>Swarnajit Chatterjee, Matthieu Mangeat, Chul-Ung Woo, Heiko Rieger, Jae Dong Noh</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the two-species Vicsek model (TSVM) consisting of two kinds of
self-propelled particles, A and B, that tend to align with particles from the
same species and to anti-align with the other. The model shows a flocking
transition that is reminiscent of the original Vicsek model: it has a
liquid-gas phase transition and displays micro-phase separation in the
coexistence region where multiple dense liquid bands propagate in a gaseous
background. The novel feature of the TSVM is the existence of two kinds of
bands, one composed of mainly A-particles and one mainly of B-particles, and
the appearance of two dynamical states in the coexistence region: the PF
(parallel flocking) state in which all bands of the two species propagate in
the same direction, and the APF (anti-parallel flocking) state in which the
bands of species A and species B move in opposite directions. When PF and APF
states exist in the low-density part of the coexistence region they perform
stochastic transitions from one to the other. The system size dependence of the
transition frequency and dwell times shows a pronounced crossover that is
determined by the ratio of the band width and the longitudinal system size. Our
work paves the way for studying multi-species flocking models with
heterogeneous alignment interactions.

<h3>Light-Hole Gate-Defined Spin-Orbit Qubit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10514" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10514</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick Del Vecchio, Oussama Moutanabbir</i>
<br>
<br>
The selective confinement of light-holes (LHs) is demonstrated by introducing
a low-dimensional system consisting of highly tensile-strained Ge quantum well
enabling the design of an ultrafast gate-defined spin qubit under the electric
dipole spin resonance. The qubit size-dependent $g$-factor and dipole moment
are mapped, and the parameters inducing their modulation are discussed. It is
found that the LH qubit dipole moment is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than
that of the canonical heavy-hole qubit. This behavior originates from the
significant spin splitting resulting from the combined action of large cubic
and linear Rashba spin-orbit interactions that are peculiar to LHs. The qubit
relaxation rate is also affected by the strong spin-orbit interaction and
follows typically a $B^7$ behavior. The proposed all-group IV, direct bandgap
LH qubit provides an effective platform for a scalable qubit-optical photon
interface sought-after for long-range entanglement distribution and quantum
networks.

<h3>By how much can closed-loop frameworks accelerate computational  materials discovery?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10533" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10533</a>

<br>
<br>
The implementation of automation and machine learning surrogatization within
closed-loop computational workflows is an increasingly popular approach to
accelerate materials discovery. However, the scale of the speedup associated
with this paradigm shift from traditional manual approaches remains an open
question. In this work, we rigorously quantify the acceleration from each of
the components within a closed-loop framework for material hypothesis
evaluation by identifying four distinct sources of speedup: (1) task
automation, (2) calculation runtime improvements, (3) sequential
learning-driven design space search, and (4) surrogatization of expensive
simulations with machine learning models. This is done using a time-keeping
ledger to record runs of automated software and corresponding manual
computational experiments within the context of electrocatalysis. From a
combination of the first three sources of acceleration, we estimate that
overall hypothesis evaluation time can be reduced by over 90%, i.e., achieving
a speedup of $\sim$$10\times$. Further, by introducing surrogatization into the
loop, we estimate that the design time can be reduced by over 95%, i.e.,
achieving a speedup of $\sim$$15$-$20\times$. Our findings present a clear
value proposition for utilizing closed-loop approaches for accelerating
materials discovery.

<h3>Mean-field ground-state phase diagram of the ${t-t^\prime}$  ionic-Hubbard chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10543" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10543</a>

<br>
<br>
Ground state (GS) phase diagram of the one dimensional repulsive Hubbard
model with both nearest neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t^{\prime}$)
hopping and a staggered potential ($\Delta$) is determined in the case of
half-filled band and zero net magnetization within the mean-field theory. The
model may be realized by cold atoms in engineered optical lattices. Connection
between the peculiarities of the GS phase diagram of the interacting system and
the topological Lifshitz transition in GS of free particle chain is discussed.
The mean-field Hamiltonian is given by six order parameters, which are
determined self-consistently. It is shown that the GS phase diagram {\em
predominantly} consists of insulating phases characterized by coexistence of
the long-range ordered modulations of the charge- (I) and antiferromagnetic
(AF) spin-density with wavelengths equal to two and/or four lattice units.
Below the Lifshitz transition, the GS phase diagram is qualitatively similar to
that of the standard (${t^{\prime}=0}$) ionic Hubbard model. After the Lifshitz
transition, charge- and spin-density modulations emerge within the sublattices
and have wavelengths equal to four lattice units. For moderate values of the
on-site repulsion the insulating phases are characterized by the presence of I
and AF modulations coexisting with ferrimagnetic spin- and charge-density
modulations within the one sublattice, or by the coexistence of I order and
additional AF spin density modulation only within the sublattice with high
ionic potential. At large repulsion the insulating phase with AF order inside
both sublattices and remaining small ionicity left between the sublattices is
realized.

<h3>Resolving the puzzle of sound propagation in a dilute Bose-Einstein  condensate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10570" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10570</a>
<br>
<i>Konstantin G. Zloshchastiev</i>
<br>
<br>
A unified model of a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate is proposed, combining
of the logarithmic and Gross-Pitaevskii nonlinear terms in a wave equation,
where the Gross-Pitaevskii term describes two-body interactions, as suggested
by standard perturbation theory; while the logarithmic term is essentially
non-perturbative, and takes into account quantum vacuum effects. The model is
shown to have excellent agreement with sound propagation data in the condensate
of cold sodium atoms known since the now classic works by Andrews and
collaborators. The data also allowed us to place constraints on two of the
unified model's parameters, which describe the strengths of the logarithmic and
Gross-Pitaevskii terms. Additionally, we suggest an experiment constraining the
value of the third parameter (the characteristic density scale of the
logarithmic part of the model), using the conjectured attraction-repulsion
transition of many-body interaction inside the condensate.

<h3>Josephson diode effect on the surface of topological insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10572" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10572</a>
<br>
<i>Bo Lu, Satoshi Ikegaya, Pablo Burset, Yukio Tanaka, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the Josephson diode effect in a superconductor-normal
metal-superconductor junction on the surface of a three-dimensional topological
insulator when an in-plane magnetic field is applied. We find strong dependence
of the current-phase relation on the transverse momentum and sign changes of
the quality factor as the magnitude of magnetic field varies. These sign
changes require a long junction length and are absent in the one-dimensional
limit. Our work indicates that high-dimensional rectification systems have rich
properties due to multiple transport channels, which can be used for designing
realistic superconducting diode devices.

<h3>Density-tuned effective metal-insulator transitions in 2D semiconductor  layers: Anderson localization or Wigner crystallization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10673" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10673</a>
<br>
<i>Seongjin Ahn, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
Electrons (or holes) confined in 2D semiconductor layers have served as model
systems for studying disorder and interaction effects for almost 50 years. In
particular, strong disorder drives the metallic 2D carriers into a strongly
localized Anderson insulator (AI) at low densities whereas pristine 2D
electrons in the presence of no (or little) disorder should solidify into a
Wigner crystal at low carrier densities. Since the disorder in 2D
semiconductors is mostly Coulomb disorder arising from random charged
impurities, the applicable physics is complex as the carriers interact with
each other as well as with the random charged impurities through the same
long-range Coulomb coupling. By critically theoretically analyzing the
experimental transport data in depth using a realistic transport theory to
calculate the low-temperature 2D resistivity as a function of carrier density
in 11 different experimental samples covering 9 different materials, we
establish, utilizing the Ioffe-Regel-Mott criterion for strong localization, a
direct connection between the critical localization density for the 2D
metal-insulator transition (MIT) and the sample mobility deep into the metallic
state, which for clean samples could lead to a localization density low enough
to make the transition appear to be a Wigner crystallization. We believe that
the insulating phase is always an effective Coulomb disorder-induced localized
AI, which may have short-range WC-like correlations at low carrier densities.
Our theoretically calculated disorder-driven critical MIT density agrees with
experimental findings in all 2D samples, even for the ultra-clean samples. In
particular, the extrapolated critical density for the 2D MIT seems to vanish
when the high-density mobility goes to infinity, indicating that transport
probes a disorder-localized insulating ground state independent of how low the
carrier density might be.

<h3>Anomalous sign inversion of spin-orbit torque in  ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic bilayer systems due to self-induced spin-orbit  torque</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10692" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10692</a>
<br>
<i>Motomi Aoki, Ei Shigematsu, Ryo Ohshima, Teruya Shinjo, Masashi Shiraishi, Yuichiro Ando</i>
<br>
<br>
Self-induced spin-orbit torques (SI-SOTs) in ferromagnetic (FM) layers have
been overlooked when estimating the spin Hall angle (SHA) of adjacent
nonmagnetic (NM) layers. In this work, we observe anomalous sign inversion of
the total SOT in the spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance due to the enhanced
SI-SOT, and successfully rationalize the sign inversion through a theoretical
calculation considering the SHE in both the NM and FM layers. The findings show
that using an FM layer whose SHA sign is the same as that of the NM achieves
efficient SOT-magnetization switching with the assistance of the SI-SOT. The
contribution of the SI-SOT becomes salient for a weakly conductive NM layer,
and conventional analyses that do not consider the SI-SOT can overestimate the
SHA of the NM layer by a factor of more than 150.

<h3>Parametric triggering of vortices in toroidally trapped rotating  Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10694" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10694</a>
<br>
<i>M. Arivazhagan, P. Muruganandam, N. Athavan</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the creation of vortices by triggering the rotating Bose-Einstein
condensates in a toroidal trap with trap parameters such as laser beam waist
and Gaussian potential depth. By numerically solving the time-dependent
Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two dimensions, we observe a change in vortex
structure and a considerable increase in the number of vortices when the waist
of the irradiated laser beam is in consonance with the area of the condensate
as we vary the Gaussian potential depth. By computing the root mean square
radius of the condensate, we confirm the variation in the number of vortices
generated as a function of the ratio between the root-mean-square radius of the
condensate and the laser beam waist. In particular, the number of hidden
vortices reaches the maximum value when the above ratio is close to the value
0.7. We find the variation in the number of vortices is rapid for deeper
Gaussian potentials, and we conclude that the larger beam waist and deeper
Gaussian potentials generate more vortices. Further, we calculate the number of
vortices using the Feynman rule with Thomas Fermi approximation and compare
them with the numerical results. We also observe that the critical rotation
frequency decreases with an increase in depth of Gaussian potential.

<h3>Theory of quasi-ballistic FET: steady-state regime and low-frequency  noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10697</a>
<br>
<i>Mykola Yelisieiev, Vyacheslav Kochelap</i>
<br>
<br>
We present the theoretical analysis of steady state regimes and low-frequency
noises in quasi-ballistic FETs. The noise analysis is based on the Langevin
approach, which accounts for the microscopic sources of fluctuations originated
from intrachannel electron scattering. The general formulas for local
fluctuations of the carrier concentration, velocity and electrostatic potential
as well, as their distributions along the channel are found as functions of
applied voltage/current. Two circuit regimes with stabilized current and
stabilized voltage are considered. The noise intensities for the devices with
different ballisticity are compared. We suggest that the presented analysis
makes better comprehension of physics of electron transport and fluctuations in
quasi-ballistic FETs, improves their theoretical description and can be useful
for device simulation and design.

<h3>Phase diagram of superconducting vortex ratchet motion in a superlattice  with noncentrosymmetry</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ratchet motion of superconducting vortices, which is a directional flow of
vortices in superconductors, is highly useful for exploring quantum phenomena
and developing superconducting devices, such as superconducting diode and
microwave antenna. However, because of the challenges in the quantitative
characterization of the dynamic motion of vortices, a phase diagram of the
vortex ratchet motion is still missing, especially in the superconductors with
low dimensional structures. Here we establish a quantitative phase diagram of
the vortex ratchet motion in a highly anisotropic superlattice superconductor,
(SnS)1.17NbS2, using nonreciprocal magnetotransport. The (SnS)1.17NbS2, which
possesses a layered atomic structure and noncentrosymmetry, exhibits
nonreciprocal magnetotransport in a magnetic field perpendicular and parallel
to the plane, which is considered a manifest of ratchet motion of
superconducting vortices. We demonstrated that the ratchet motion is responsive
to current excitation, magnetic field and thermal perturbation. Furthermore, we
extrapolated a giant nonreciprocal coefficient ({\gamma}), which quantitatively
describes the magnitude of the vortex ratchet motion, and eventually
established phase diagrams of the ratchet motion of the vortices with a
quantitative description. Last, we propose that the ratchet motion originates
from the coexistence of pancake vortices (PVs) and Josephson vortices (JVs).
The phase diagrams are desirable for controlling the vortex motion in
superlattice superconductors and developing next-generation energy-efficient
superconducting devices.

<h3>A topological transition-induced giant transverse thermoelectric effect  in polycrystalline Dirac semimetal Mg3Bi2</h3>

<br>
<br>
To achieve thermoelectric energy conversion, a large transverse
thermoelectric effect in topological materials is crucial. However, the general
relationship between topological electronic structures and transverse
thermoelectric effect remains unclear, restricting the rational design of novel
transverse thermoelectric materials. Herein, we demonstrate a topological
transition-induced giant transverse thermoelectric effect in polycrystalline
Mn-doped Mg3+{\delta}Bi2 material, which has a competitively large transverse
thermopower (617 uV/K), power factor (20393 uWm-1K-2), magnetoresistance
(16600%), and electronic mobility (35280cm2V-1S-1). The high performance is
triggered by the modulation of chemical pressure and disorder effects in the
presence of Mn doping, which induces the transition from a topological
insulator to a Dirac semimetal. The high-performance polycrystalline Mn-doped
Mg3+{\delta} Bi2 described in this work robustly boosts transverse
thermoelectric effect through topological phase transition, paving a new avenue
for the material design of transverse thermoelectricity.

<h3>MSGCorep: A package for corepresentations of magnetic space groups</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by easy access to complete corepresentation (corep) data of all the
1651 magnetic space groups (MSGs) in three-dimensional space, we have developed
a Mathematica package MSGCorep to provide an offline database of coreps and
various functions to manipulate them, based on our previous package
SpaceGroupIrep. One can use the package MSGCorep to obtain the elements of any
MSG and magnetic little group, to calculate the multiplication of group
elements, to obtain the small coreps at any k-point and full coreps of any
magnetic k-star for any MSG and show them in a user-friendly table form, to
calculate and show the decomposition of direct products of full coreps between
any two specified magnetic k-stars, and to determine the small coreps of energy
bands. Both single-valued and double-valued coreps are supported. In addition,
the 122 magnetic point groups (MPGs) and their coreps are also supported by
this package. To the best of our knowledge, MSGCorep is the first package that
is able to calculate the direct product of full coreps for any MSG and able to
determine small coreps of energy bands for general purpose. In a word, the
MSGCorep package is an offline database and tool set for MSGs, MPGs, and their
coreps, and it is very useful to study the symmetries in magnetic and
nonmagnetic materials.

We propose a thermodynamic model of free energy expansion up to eighth order
of magnetisation to describe the complex magnetic phase transitions in
ferromagnetic superconductor UGe$_2$. The model successfully describes
transitions between ordered phases which take place without changing of
magnetic structure but only of magnetisation which is the case of UGe$_2$ where
two magnetic phases with same structure but with different magnitude occur with
decreasing of temperature. We consider the infuence of pressure on magnetic
transitions in the simplest form of including it only in pressure dependence of
Curie temperature for the transition between the paramagnetic and themagnetic
phase with the lower magnetic moment FM1. Our results show that for pressures
lower than some limiting pressure the transition betweenlow-and
high-magnetisation phase remains of crossover type. Above this limiting
pressure this transition changes to real thermodynamic transition of first
order.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate epitaxial thin film growth of the chalcogenide perovskite
semiconducting alloy system BaZrS$_{(3-y)}$Se$_y$ using gas-source molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE). BaZrS$_3$ is stable in the perovskite structure in bulk
form, but the pure selenide BaZrSe$_3$ is not. Here stabilize the full range of
compositions y = 0 ... 3 in the perovskite structure, up to and including
BaZrSe$_3$, by growing on BaZrS$_3$ buffer layers. The alloy grows by
pseudomorphic heteroepitaxy on the sulfide buffer, without interruption in the
reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) pattern. The resulting
films are environmentally stable and the direct band gap (E$_g$) varies
strongly with Se content, as predicted by theory, covering the range E$_g$ =
1.9 ... 1.4 eV for y = 0 ... 3. This creates possibilities for visible and
near-infrared (VIS-NIR) optoelectronics, solid state lighting, and solar cells
using chalcogenide perovskites.

<h3>The Viscosity of Polyelectrolyte Solutions and its Dependence on their  Persistence Length, Concentration and Solvent Quality</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, a comprehensive study about the influence on shear viscosity of
polyelectrolyte concentration, persistence length, salt concentration and
solvent quality is reported, using numerical simulations of confined solutions
under stationary Poiseuille flow. Various scaling regimes for the viscosity are
reproduced, both under good solvent and theta solvent conditions. The key role
played by the electrostatic interactions in the viscosity is borne out when the
ionic strength is varied. It is argued that these results are helpful for the
understanding of viscosity scaling in entangled polyelectrolyte solutions for
both rigid and flexible polyelectrolytes in different solvents, which is needed
to perform intelligent design of new polyelectrolytes capable of fine tuning
the viscosity in complex fluids.

<h3>The Effective Interfacial Tensions between Pure Liquids and Rough  Solids: A Coarse-Grained Simulation Study</h3>

<br>
<br>
The effective solid liquid interfacial tension (SL IFT) between pure liquids
and rough solid surfaces is studied through coarse grained simulations. Using
the dissipative particle dynamics method, we design solid liquid interfaces,
confining a pure liquid between two explicit solid surfaces with different
roughness degrees. The roughness of the solid phase was characterized by Wenzel
roughness factor and the effective SL IFT ({\gamma}_sl^') is reported as a
function of it also. Two solid liquid systems differentiated from each other by
their solid liquid repulsion strength are studied to measure the effects caused
by the surface roughness on the calculation of {\gamma}_sl^'. We found that the
roughness produces changes in the structure of the liquid, which is observed in
the first layer of liquid near the solid. These changes are responsible for the
effective SL IFT increase as surface roughness increases. Although there is a
predominance of surface roughness in the calculation of {\gamma}_sl^', it is
found that the effective SL IFT is directly proportional to the magnitude of
the solid liquid repulsion strength. The insights provided by these simulations
suggest that the increase of Wenzel roughness factor is a direct consequence of
the increase in surface area due to the vertical deviations measured in the
topography. This, in turn, produces an increase in the number of effective
solid liquid interactions between particles, eventually yielding significant
changes in the local values of the normal and tangential components of the
pressure tensor.

<br>
<br>
Large-area single-crystal surface structures were successfully prepared on
Cu(111) substrate with boron deposition, which is critical for prospective
applications. However, the proposed borophene structures do not match the
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results very well, while the proposed
copper boride is at odds with the traditional knowledge that ordered
copper-rich borides normally do not exist due to small difference in
electronegativity and large difference in atomic size. To clarify the
controversy and elucidate the formation mechanism of the unexpected copper
boride, we conducted systematic STM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy investigations, confirming the
synthesis of two-dimensional copper boride rather than borophene on Cu(111)
after boron deposition under ultrahigh vacuum. First-principles calculations
with defective surface models further indicate that boron atoms tend to react
with Cu atoms near terrace edges or defects, which in turn shapes the
intermediate structures of copper boride and leads to the formation of stable
Cu-B monolayer via large-scale surface reconstruction eventually.

<h3>Theory of superconducting qubits beyond the lumped element approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10852" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10852</a>
<br>
<i>Ari Mizel</i>
<br>
<br>
In the design and investigation of superconducting qubits and related
devices, a lumped element circuit model is the standard theoretical approach.
However, many important physical questions lie beyond the scope of this
approach, such as the consequences of very strong or otherwise unconventional
Josephson junctions, the properties of small qubit devices, and the number of
entangled electrons in superconducting Schrodinger cats. By performing gauge
transformations on self-consistent solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations, we develop here a formalism that is capable of addressing these
questions. We then apply the formalism to a charge qubit and to an RF squid
qubit. This theory provides a promising tool to accompany the remarkable
experimental achievements driving superconducting qubits forward.

<br>
<br>
We use Monte Carlo and genetic algorithms to train neural-network
feedback-control protocols for simulated fluctuating nanosystems. These
protocols convert the information obtained by the feedback process into heat or
work, allowing the extraction of work from a colloidal particle pulled by an
optical trap and the absorption of entropy by an Ising model undergoing
magnetization reversal. The learning framework requires no prior knowledge of
the system, depends only upon measurements that are accessible experimentally,
and scales to systems of considerable complexity. It could be used in the
laboratory to learn protocols for fluctuating nanosystems that convert
measurement information into stored work or heat.

<h3>Quench dynamics in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced ionic Hubbard  model</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhuotao Xie, Ming Zhao, Hantao Lu, Zhongbing Huang, Gregory A. Fiete, Xiang Hu, Liang Du</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the time-dependent Lanczos method, we study the non-equilibrium
dynamics of the one-dimensional ionic-mass imbalanced Hubbard chain driven by a
quantum quench of the on-site Coulomb interaction, where the system is prepared
in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with a different Hubbard interaction. A
full exact diagonalization is adopted to study the zero temperature phase
diagram in equilibrium, which is shown to be in good agreement with previous
studies using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We then study the
non-equilibrium quench dynamics of the spin and charge order parameters by
fixing the initial and final Coulomb interaction while changing the quenching
time protocols. The Lanczos method allows us to reach longer times following
the quench than DMRG. Our study shows that the time evolution of the charge and
spin order parameters strongly depend on the quenching time protocols. In
particular, the effective temperature of the system will decrease monotonically
as the quenching time is increased. Finally, by taking the final Coulomb
interaction strength to be in the strong coupling regime, we find that the
oscillation frequency of the charge order parameter increases monotonically
with the Coulomb interaction. By contrast, the frequency of the spin order
parameter decreases monotonically with increasing Coulomb interaction. We
explain this result using an effective spin model in the strong coupling limit.
Our study suggests strategies to engineer the relaxation behavior of
interacting quantum many-particle systems.

Room-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroicity has been observed in c-axis
oriented GaFeO$_3$ thin films (space group $Pna2_1$), grown on economic and
technologically important (100)Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition
technique. Structural analysis and comprehensive mapping of Ga:Fe ratio across
a length scale range of 10$^4$ reveal coexistence of epitaxial and chemical
strain. It induces formation of finer magnetic domains and large
magnetoelectric coupling - decrease in remanent polarization by $\sim$21\%
under $\sim$50 kOe. Magnetic force microscopy reveals presence of both finer
($<$100 nm) and coarser ($\sim$2 $\mu$m) magnetic domains. Strong
multiferroicity in epitaxial GaFeO$_3$ thin films, grown on (100)Si substrate,
brighten the prospect of their integration with Si-based electronics and could
pave the way for development of economic and more efficient electromechanical,
electrooptic or magnetoelectric sensor devices.

<br>
<i>Florian Vogel, Matthias Fuchs</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the vibrational properties of topologically disordered
materials by analytically studying particles that harmonically oscillate around
random positions. Exploiting field theory in the thermodynamic limit at $T=0$,
we build up a self-consistent model by analysing the Hessian utilizing
Euclidean Random Matrix theory. In accordance with earlier findings [1], we
take non-planar diagrams into account to correctly address multiple local
scattering events. By doing so, we end up with a first principles theory that
can predict the main anomalies of athermal disordered materials, including the
boson peak, sound softening, and Rayleigh damping of sound. In the vibrational
density of states, the sound modes lead to Debye's law for small frequencies.
Additionally, quasi-localised modes (QLMs), cause an excess in the density of
states starting as $\omega^4$ in the low frequency limit.

<h3>Sublattice-enriched tunability of bound states in second-order  topological insulators and superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bound states at sharp corners have been widely viewed as the hallmark of
two-dimensional second-order topological insulators and superconductors. In
this work, we show that the existence of sublattice degrees of freedom can
enrich the tunability of bound states on the boundary and hence lift the
constraint on their locations. We take the Kane-Mele model with
honeycomb-lattice structure to illustrate the underlying physics. With the
introduction of an in-plane exchange field to the model, we find that the
boundary Dirac mass induced by the exchange field has a sensitive dependence on
the boundary sublattice termination. We find that the sensitive sublattice
dependence can lead bound states to emerge at a specific type of boundary
defects named as sublattice domain walls if the exchange field is of
ferromagnetic nature, even in the absence of any sharp corner on the boundary.
Remarkably, this sensitive dependence of the boundary Dirac mass on the
boundary sublattice termination allows the positions of bound states to be
manipulated to any place on the boundary for an appropriately-designed sample.
With a further introduction of conventional s-wave superconductivity to the
model, we find that, no matter whether the exchange field is ferromagnetic,
antiferromagnetic, or ferrimagnetic, highly controllable Majorana zero modes
can be achieved at the sublattice domain walls. Our work reshapes the
understanding of boundary physics in second-order topological phases, and
meanwhile opens potential avenues to realize highly controllable bound states
for potential applications.

<h3>Investigation of quasi-cleavage in a hydrogen charged maraging stainless  steel</h3>

<br>
<br>
Slow strain rates tests (SSRT) were conducted on hydrogen-containing
specimens of PH13-8Mo maraging stainless steel. Hydrogen-assisted subcritical
quasi-cleavage cracking was shown to take place during SSRT, thus accelerating
material failure. Fractographic analysis showed that quasi-cleavage is composed
of flat brittle areas and rougher areas. Using cross-sectional electron
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of a secondary subcritically grown
crack, we observed brittle cracks propagated across martensite blocks ahead the
main crack tip. These cracks were stopped at high-angle boundaries. The crack
direction was consistent with propagation along {100} type planes.
High-resolution EBSD showed significant crystal lattice rotation, hence
consequential plastic deformation, concentrated between the main crack tip and
the cracks located ahead it. It is concluded that quasi-cleavage in the
material investigated here consists of {100} cleavage cracks connected by
ductile ridges. A discontinuous mechanism, involving re-initiation of new
cleavage cracks ahead the main crack tip is suggested.

<br>
<br>
2H-NbSe2 is an archetypal system in which superconductivity and
charge-density-wave (CDW) coexist and compete macroscopically with each other.
In particular, this interplay also manifests in their dynamical fluctuations.
As a result, the superconducting amplitude fluctuations (i.e. Higgs mode) is
pushed below the quasiparticle continuum, allowing it to become a coherent
excitation observable by Raman scattering. In the present study, we coherently
drive the collective oscillations of the two orders and visualize their
interplay in the driven states in the time domain. We find that both collective
modes contribute to terahertz third harmonic generation (THG) and the THG
signals interfere below Tc, leading to an anti-resonance of the integrated THG
signal. The dynamical Ginzburg-Landau model suggests that around the
anti-resonance a periodic energy transfer between the driven Higgs oscillations
and the driven CDW oscillations is possible. In addition to 2H-NbSe2, we also
studied an underdoped La2-xSrxCuO4 (x ~ 0.12) driven beyond the perturbative
regime of THG. A similar interference between two sources of THG is observed
below Tc. While there might be additional sources of THG in these experiments,
our results illustrate the roles of coupled modes in the terahertz THG process
and the tantalizing possibility of coherent control via such couplings.

<h3>Microstructure reconstruction using diffusion-based generative models</h3>

<br>

Microstructure reconstruction has been an essential part of computational
material engineering to reveal the relationship between the microstructures and
the material properties. However, it is still challenging to find a general
solution for microstructure characterization and reconstruction (MCR) tasks
although there have been many attempts such as the descriptor-based
reconstruction methods. To address this generality problem, the denoising
diffusion probabilistic models are first employed for the microstructure
reconstruction task which can be applied to various types of material systems.
Several microstructures (e.g., carbonate, ceramics, copolymer, etc.) are
considered to be reproduced for validating the proposed models while addressing
the quality of the generated images with the quantitative evaluation metrics
(FID score, precision and recall). The results show that the proposed diffusion
model based approach is applicable for reproducing various types of
microstructures with different spatial distributions of morphological features.
The present approach also provides a stable training procedure with simple
implementation for generating visually similar microstructures (and also
statistically equivalent) without requiring expert knowledge and some
time-consuming parametric studies. The proposed approach has the potential of
being a universal microstructure reconstruction method for handling complex
microstructures for materials science.

We investigate the Yang-Lee singularity in BCS superconductivity, and find
that the zeros of the partition function accumulate on the boundary of a

We report on coherent propagation of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin waves over
a long distance ($\sim$10 $\mu$m) at room temperature in a canted AFM
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI).
Unprecedented high group velocities (up to 22.5 km/s) are characterized by
microwave transmission using all-electrical spin wave spectroscopy. We derive
analytically AFM spin-wave dispersion in the presence of the DMI which accounts
for our experimental results. The AFM spin waves excited by nanometric coplanar
waveguides with large wavevectors enter the exchange regime and follow a
quasi-linear dispersion relation. Fitting of experimental data with our
theoretical model yields an AFM exchange stiffness length of 1.7 angstrom. Our
results provide key insights on AFM spin dynamics and demonstrate high-speed
functionality for AFM magnonics.

The work is devoted to the theoretical and numerical analysis of a
two-component superparamagnetic system. Namely, of a rigid superparamagnetic
cluster embedded in a superparamagnetic medium and subjected to a uniform
magnetic field. Both cluster and the medium contain single-domain nanoparticles
of the same diameter and magnetic moment. But the concentration of
nanoparticles within the cluster is higher than that in the surrounding medium.
Equilibrium magnetic response of the system in wide ranges of concentrations
and interaction energies is calculated using Langevin dynamics simulations.
Corresponding theoretical predictions are obtained within the analytical
framework, previously developed for ferrofluid emulsions. The framework is
proven to be accurate in the case when nanoparticles of the medium are
immobilized. However, if particles are subjected to a translational Brownian
motion, the applied field causes their local redistribution in the cluster
vicinity. This behavior is reminiscent of the so-called ``haloing'' effect
previously observed experimentally in bimodal magnetorheological fluids. It is
shown that the haloing can lead to an anomalous increase of the system
magnetization at large enough applied fields.

Magnonic crystals are structures with periodically varied magnetic properties
that are used to control collective spin-wave excitations. With micromagnetic
simulations, we study spin-wave spectra in a 2D antidot lattice based on a
multilayered thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We show
that the modification of the PMA near the antidot edges introduces interesting
modifications to the spin-wave spectra, even in a fully saturated state. In
particular, the spectra split in two types of excitations, bulk modes with
amplitude concentrated in a homogeneous part of antidot lattice, and edge modes
with an amplitude localized in the rims of reduced PMA at the antidot edges.
Their dependence on the geometrical or material parameters is distinct but at
resonance conditions fulfilled, we found strong hybridization between bulk and
radial edge modes. Interestingly, the hybridization between the fundamental
modes in bulk and rim is of magnetostatic origin but the exchange interactions
determine the coupling between higher-order radial rim modes and the
fundamental bulk mode of the antidot lattice.

<br>
Quantum Griffiths singularity is characterized by the divergence of the
dynamical critical exponent with the activated scaling law and has been widely
observed in various two-dimensional superconductors. Recently, the direct
activated scaling analysis with the irrelevant correction has been proposed and
successfully used to analyze the experimental data of crystalline PdTe2 and
polycrystalline \b{eta}-W films, which provides new evidence of quantum
Griffiths singularity. Here we show that the direct activated scaling analysis
is applicable to the experimental data in different superconducting films,
including tri-layer Ga films and LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface superconductor. When
taking the irrelevant correction into account, we calculate the corrected sheet
resistance at ultralow temperatures. The scaling behavior of the corrected
resistance in a comparably large temperature regime and the theoretical fitting
of the phase boundary give unambiguous evidence of quantum Griffiths
singularity. Compared to the previous method based on the finite size scaling,
the direct activated scaling analysis represents a more direct and precise way
to analyze the experimental data of quantum Griffiths singularity in diverse
two-dimensional superconductors.

Two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets offer the unprecedented opportunity to
study interactions between collective modes that in standard bulk ferromagnets
do not cross paths. Indeed, they harbor an optical spin-wave branch, i.e. a
spin wave which disperses weakly near the Brillouin zone center. When doped
with free carriers, they also host the typical gapless plasmonic mode of 2D
itinerant electron/hole systems. When the plasmon branch meets the optical
spin-wave branch, energy and momentum matching occurs, paving the way for
interactions between the charge and spin sector. In this Letter we present a
microscopic theory of such plasmon-magnon interactions, which is based on a
double random phase approximation. We comment on the possibility to unveil this
physics in recently isolated 2D honeycomb magnets such as ${\rm Cr}_2{\rm
Ge}_2{\rm Te}_6$.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the magnetocaloric effect obtained by the rotation of a
magnetic field applied to an exchange-coupled multilayer system composed of two
different ferromagnetic (FM) materials. We specifically consider a system in
which the two FMs have perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy axes and utilise
conditions which yield a reorientation of the total magnetization when
compensation between the anisotropies of the two layers occurs. We calculate
the consequent entropy change associated with the "artificial" reorientation.
By using known parameters from MnBi and Co we predict an entropy change of
$\Delta s = 0.34$ Jkg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for perfect coupling. Lastly, we study the
behavior of the multilayer under a rotating magnetic field via a micromagnetic
model. When the layer thicknesses are of the order of the local domain wall
width, the magnetic field-induced entropy change can be obtained with magnetic
fields one order of magnitude lower than in the uncoupled case.

found that in the reverse field, the effect of switching the nature of the

The concept of Berry curvature is essential for various transport phenomena.
However, an effect of the Berry curvature on magnetochiral anisotropy, i.e.
nonreciprocal magneto-transport, is still elusive. Here, we report the Berry
curvature originates the large magnetochiral anisotropy. In Weyl-semimetal
WTe2, we observed the strong enhancement of the magnetochiral anisotropy when
the Fermi level is located near the Weyl points. Notably, the maximal figure of
merit $\bar{\gamma}$ reaches $1.2\,{\times}10^{-6} \rm{m^2T^{-1}A^{-1}}$, which
is the largest ever reported in bulk materials. Our semiclassical calculation
shows that the diverging Berry curvature at the Weyl points strongly enhances
the magnetochiral anisotropy.

quantum phenomena. Here we find two anomalous acoustic plasmons (AAPs) are
dictated by the distinct geometry of two-dimensional (2D) type-II Dirac cones,
far beyond the conventional $\text{\ensuremath{\sqrt{q}}}$ plasmon. One AAP
originates from the strong hybridization of two pockets at one Dirac point,
whereas the other is attributed to the significant enhancement of the band
correlation around the open Fermi surface. Remarkably, the plasmons exhibit
valley-dependent chirality along the tilting direction due to the chiral
electron dispersion. Meanwhile, we discuss the tunability of plasmon dispersion
and lifetime by tuning the gap and dielectric substrate. Our work provides a
promising way to generate the novel plasmons in Dirac materials.

We study the magnetic phase diagram of an ensemble of dipolar hard spheres
(DHS) with or without uniaxial anisotropy and frozen in position on a
disordered structure by tempered Monte Carlo simulations. The crucial point is
to consider an anisotropic structure, obtained from the liquid state of the
dipolar hard spheres fluid, frozen in its polarized state at low temperature.
The freezing inverse temperature $\beta_f$ determines the degree of anisotropy
of the structure which is quantified through a structural nematic order
parameter, $\lambda_s$. The case of the non zero uniaxial anisotropy is
considered only in its infinitely strong strength limit where the system
transforms in a dipolar Ising model (DIM). The important finding of this work
is that both the DHS and the DIM with a frozen structure build in this way
present a ferromagnetic phase at volume fractions below the threshold value
where the corresponding isotropic DHS systems exhibit a spin glass phase at low
temperature.

The hourglass fermions in solid-state materials have been attracting
significant interest recently. However, realistic two-dimensional (2D)
materials with hourglass-shaped band structures are still very scarce. Here,
through the first-principles calculations, we identify the monolayer
Pb(ClO$_{2}$)$_{2}$ and Sr(ClO$_{2}$)$_{2}$ materials as the new realistic
materials platform to realize 2D hourglass Weyl nodal loop. We show that these
monolayer materials possess an hourglass Weyl nodal loop circling around the
$\Gamma$ point and Weyl nodal line on the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary in the
absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Through the symmetry analysis, we
demonstrate that the hourglass Weyl nodal loop and Weyl nodal line are
protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetries, and are robust under the biaxial
strains. When we include the SOC, a tiny gap will be opened in the hourglass
nodal loop and nodal line, and the nodal line can be transformed into the
spin-orbit Dirac points. Our results provide a new realistic material platform
for studying the intriguing physics associated with the 2D hourglass Weyl nodal
loop and spin-orbit Dirac points.

Topological superconductors (TSC) become a focus of research due to the
accompanying Majorana fermions. However, the experimentally reported TSC are
extremely rare. The recent experiments reported the kagome TSC AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$
(A=K, Rb, Cs), which exhibit unique superconductivity, topological surface
states (TSS), and Majorana bound states. More recently, the first
titanium-based kagome superconductor CsTi$ _{3} $Bi$ _{5} $ with nontrivial
topology was successfully synthesized as a perspective TSC. Given that Cs
contributes little to the electronic structures of CsTi$ _{3} $Bi$ _{5} $ and
binary compounds may be easier to be synthesized, here, by density functional
theory calculations, we predict five stable non-magnetic kagome compounds Ti$
_{6} $X$ _{4} $ (X = Bi, Sb, Pb, Tl, In) which exhibit superconductivity with
critical temperature Tc = 3.8$ - $5.1 K, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}$$_2$ band
topology, and TSS close to the Fermi level. In addition, the large intrinsic
spin Hall effect is obtained in Ti$ _{6} $X$ _{4} $, which is caused by gapped
Dirac nodes and nodal lines due to a strong spin-orbit coupling. This work
offers new platforms for TSC and spintronic devices.

<br>
Nanoribbons - nanometer wide strips of a two-dimensional material - are a
unique system in condensed matter physics. They combine the exotic electronic
structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed
edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times, quantum
confinement and topologically protected states can emerge. An exciting prospect
for this new material concept is the potential for both a tunable
semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge.
This combination of magnetism and semiconducting properties is the first step
in unlocking spin-based electronics such as non-volatile transistors, a route
to low-energy computing, and has thus far typically only been observed in doped
semiconductor systems and/or at low temperatures. Here, we report the magnetic
and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). Static (SQUID)
and dynamic (EPR) magnetization probes demonstrate that at room temperature,
films of PNRs exhibit macroscopic magnetic properties, arising from their edge,
with internal fields of ~ 250 to 800 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic
anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at modest sub-1T fields. By leveraging
this alignment effect, we discover that upon photoexcitation, energy is rapidly
funneled to a dark-exciton state that is localized to the magnetic edge and
coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as
a unique candidate system for studying the interplay of magnetism and
semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone
towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.

<h3>Classical-quantum correspondence of special and extraordinary-log  criticality: Villain's bridge</h3>

<br>
There has been much recent progress on exotic surface critical behavior, yet
the classical-quantum correspondence of special and extraordinary-log
criticality remains largely unclear. Employing worm Monte Carlo simulations, we
explore the surface criticality at an emergent superfluid-Mott insulator
critical point in the Villain representation, which is believed to connect
classical and quantum O(2) critical systems. We observe a special transition
with the thermal and magnetic renormalization exponents $y_t=0.58(1)$ and
$y_h=1.690(1)$ respectively, which are close to recent estimates from models
with discrete spin variables. The existence of extraordinary-log universality
is evidenced by the critical exponent $\hat{q}=0.58(2)$ from two-point
correlation and the renormalization-group parameter $\alpha=0.28(1)$ from
superfluid stiffness, which obey the scaling relation of extraordinary-log
critical theory and recover the logarithmic finite-size scaling of critical
superfluid stiffness in open-edge quantum Bose-Hubbard model. Our results
bridge recent observations of surface critical behavior in the classical
statistical mechanical models [Parisen Toldin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 135701

We study the chaos exponent of some variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)
model, namely, the $\Ns=1$ supersymmetry (SUSY)-SYK model and its sibling,
which is not supersymmetric in general, for large $q$, but for arbitrary
interaction strength. We find that the chaos exponent of these variants, as
well as the SYK and the $\Ns=2$ SUSY-SYK model, all follow a single-parameter
scaling law. By quantitative arguments we further make a conjecture, i.e. that
the found scaling law might hold for general one-dimensional (1D) SYK-like
models with large $q$. This points out a universal route from maximal chaos
towards completely regular or integrable motion in the SYK model and its 1D
variants.

<br>
Junctions provide a wealth of information on the symmetry of the order
parameter of superconductors. We analyze here normal-superconducting and
Josephson junctions involving twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and related
systems. The first junctions describe the coupling between the tip and
superconducting TBG samples in scanning tunneling microscope (STM) experiments,
while Josephson junctions and SQUIDs have been fabricated by applying
inhomogeneous gate voltages to TBG. The Fermi surface of TBG contains, at
least, two pockets, one per valley, and we concentrate on the difference
between superconducting phases which are even or odd under valley exchange (s-
and f- pairings). Andreev reflection processes in STM experiments and the
critical current, in Josephson junctions, show a strong dependence on the
nature of the superconducting electrons, and, in the STM case, on the short
range elastic scattering induced by the tip itself.

<h3>Time-reversal equivariant neural network potential and Hamiltonian for  magnetic materials</h3>

This work presents Time-reversal Equivariant Neural Network (TENN) framework.
With TENN, the time-reversal symmetry is considered in the equivariant neural
network (ENN), which generalizes the ENN to consider physical quantities
related to time-reversal symmetry such as spin and velocity of atoms. TENN-e3,
as the time-reversal-extension of E(3) equivariant neural network, is developed
to keep the Time-reversal E(3) equivariant with consideration of whether to
include the spin-orbit effect for both collinear and non-collinear magnetic
moments situations for magnetic material. TENN-e3 can construct spin neural
network potential and the Hamiltonian of magnetic material from ab-initio
calculations. Time-reversal-E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of
spinor and geometric tensors are employed in TENN-e3. Compared to the popular
ENN, TENN-e3 can describe the complex spin-lattice coupling with high accuracy
and keep time-reversal symmetry which is not preserved in the existing
E(3)-equivariant model. Also, the Hamiltonian of magnetic material with
time-reversal symmetry can be built with TENN-e3. TENN paves a new way to
spin-lattice dynamics simulations over long-time scales and electronic
structure calculations of large-scale magnetic materials.

A non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonian (NHMBH) is an effective theory of an
ultra-cold atom in an open system. Eigenvalues of such a Hamiltonian admit a
branch-cut structure, which gives rise to a novel phase transition point called
the exceptional point. Here we show that the Meissner effect of the NHMBH
breaks down at the exceptional point while the gap parameters stay finite. We
analyze the two-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Hamiltonian coupled to the
external bath, using the path-integral formalism and the non-Hermitian version
of the mean-field theory. Our result shows the novel behavior of the magnetic
field exclusive to the non-Hermitian system. It implies a possible way to
experimentally detect the exceptional point in the non-Hermitian many-body
system.

A connection between the response and fluctuation in general nonequilibrium
stationary states is investigated. We focus on time-symmetric quantities and
find that the fluctuation of a kind of empirical measure can be expressed with
the response of the empirical measure, current, and the time-symmetric current.
This relation is proven by using the fictitious stalling decomposition: We
decompose a single observed transition (edge in the state space) between two
microscopic states into two transitions such that one of the transitions stalls
in this stationary state. Through this trick, relations for stalling stationary
states apply to general nonequilibrium stationary states, which leads to the
desired relation.

Using local density correlation functions for a one-dimensional spin system,
we introduce a correlation function difference (CFD) which compares
correlations on a given site between a full system of size $L$ and its
restriction to $\ell<L$ sites. We show that CFD provides useful information on
transfer of information in quantum many-body systems by considering the
examples of ergodic, Anderson, and many-body localized regimes in disordered
XXZ spin chain. In the ergodic phase, we find that the propagation of CFD is
asymptotically faster than the spin transport but slower than the ballistic
propagation implied by the Lieb-Robinson bound. In contrast, in the localized
cases, we unravel an exponentially slow relaxation of CFD. Connections between
CFD and other observables detecting non-local correlations in the system are
discussed.

The method of moments is developed and employed to analyze the equilibrium
correlation functions of the magnetization of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in
the case of inertial magnetization dynamics. The method is based on the Taylor
series expansion of the correlation functions and the estimation of the
expansion coefficients. This method significantly reduces the complexity of
analysis of equilibrium correlation functions. Analytical expressions are
derived for the first three coefficients for the longitudinal and transverse
correlation functions for the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy of
ferromagnetic nanoparticles with a longitudinal magnetic field. The limiting
cases of very strong and negligibly weak external longitudinal fields are
considered. The Gordon sum rule for inertial magnetization dynamics is
discussed. In addition, we show that finite analytic series can be used as a
simple and satisfactory approximation for the numerical calculation of
correlation functions at short times.

Proton-conducting oxides have potential applications in hydrogen sensors,
hydrogen pumps, and other electrochemical devices including the tritium
purification and recovery systems of nuclear fusion reactors. Although the
distribution of hydrogen (H) in such oxide materials is an important aspect,
its precise measurement is difficult. In the present study, the hydrogen
solubility and diffusivity behavior of BaZr0.9Y0.1O2.95 (BZY),
BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O2.97 (BZYC), and CaZr0.9In0.1O2.95 (CZI) were studied
using tritiated heavy water vapor i.e., DTO (~2 kPa, tritium (T) = 0.1%) by
converting the photostimulated luminescence (PSL) values of the imaging plate
(IP). The samples were exposed to DTO vapor at 673 K for 2 h or at 873 K for 1
h. The disc-shaped oxide specimens (diameter ~7.5 mm; thickness ~2.3 mm;
theoretical density (TD) > 98 %) were prepared by conventional powder
metallurgy. The IP images of the specimen surfaces of all the three materials
T-exposed revealed that BZY showed the most uniform T distribution with the
highest tritium activity. The cross-sectional T concentration profiles of the
cut specimens showed that T diffused deeper into BZY and BZYC than into CZI.
The hydrogen solubility and diffusivity in the CZI specimen were lower than
that in the BZY and BZYC specimens. This suggested that barium zirconates were
more favorable proton conductors than calcium zirconates.

responsible for the sudden change in thermomechanical properties of
non-crystalline materials, by the chemical composition of the SiO2-Na2O-CaO
system, widely applicable in the production of glasses and constituent of iron,
magnesium and aluminum metallurgy slags. The SciGlass database was used to
provide data for mathematical modeling through the Python programming language,
using the method of least squares. A new equation was established, called P
Model, and it presented a lower mean absolute error and lower standard
deviation of absolute errors in relation to 3 equations in the literature. The
raised equation provides significant results in the mathematical modeling of Tg
by the chemical system SiO2-Na2O-CaO, valid for the limits of the data used in

crystallographic orientations of grains in a 3D Laguerre tessellation dataset
which represents the microstructure of a polycrystalline material. We introduce
complex stochastic models which may substitute expensive laboratory
experiments: conditional on the Laguerre tessellation, we suggest interaction
models for the distribution of cubic crystal lattice orientations, where the
interaction is between pairs of orientations for neighbouring grains in the
tessellation. We discuss parameter estimation and model comparison methods
based on maximum pseudolikelihood as well as graphical procedures for model
checking using simulations. Our methodology is applied for analysing a dataset

The superconducting diode effect has been recently reported in a variety of
systems. Various symmetry breaking mechanisms have been examined. However,
frequency ranges of these potentially important devices are still obscure. We
investigated superconducting micro-bridges of Nb$_{3}$Sn with a relatively
large diode efficiency of $\sim$ 5% using an out-of-plane magnetic field as
small as 2.5 mT; optimum magnetic fields (up to 10 mT) generate higher
efficiency (up to 10%) while higher fields, $\sim$ 15-20 mT, quench the effect.
The diode changes its polarity with the magnetic field. Interestingly, the
bridge resistance at diode operation reaches a value with a factor of 2 times
smaller than in its normal state, which is compatible with the vortex-caused
mechanism of resistivity. Further confirmation of this mechanism was revealed
by scanning electron microscopy: dissimilar edges of the superconductor strip
can be responsible for the inversion symmetry breaking. Superconductive diode
rectification was observed at frequencies up to 100 kHz, the highest reported
as of today. Estimates are in favor of much higher, GHz, range of frequencies.

Predicting material properties base on micro structure of materials has long
been a challenging problem. Recently many deep learning methods have been
developed for material property prediction. In this study, we propose a crystal
representation learning framework, Orbital CrystalNet, OCrystalNet, which
consists of two parts: atomic descriptor generation and graph representation
learning. In OCrystalNet, we first incorporate orbital field matrix (OFM) and
atomic features to construct OFM-feature atomic descriptor, and then the atomic
descriptor is used as atom embedding in the atom-bond message passing module
which takes advantage of the topological structure of crystal graphs to learn
crystal representation. To demonstrate the capabilities of OCrystalNet we
performed a number of prediction tasks on Material Project dataset and JARVIS
dataset and compared our model with other baselines and state of art methods.
To further present the effectiveness of OCrystalNet, we conducted ablation
study and case study of our model. The results show that our model have various
advantages over other state of art models.

While it is known that a resonant amplification of Tc in two-gap

chemical potential near a Lifshitz transition, little is known on tuning the Tc
resonance by cooperative interplay of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC)
joint with phonon mediated (e-ph) pairing at selected k-space spots. Here we
present first-principles quantum calculation of superconductivity in an
artificial heterostructure of metallic quantum wells with 3 nm period where
quantum size effects give two-gap superconductivity with RSOC controlled by the
internal electric field at the interface between the nanoscale metallic layers
intercalated by insulating spacer layers. The key results of this work show
that fundamental quantum mechanics effects including RSCO at the nanoscale
(Mazziotti et al Phys. Rev. B, 103, 024523, 2021) provide key tools in applied
physics for quantitative material design of unconventional high temperature
superconductors at ambient pressure. We discuss the superconducting domes where
Tc is a function of either the Lifshitz parameter (?) measuring the distance
from the topological Lifshitz transition for the appearing of a new small Fermi
surface due to quantum size effects with finite spin-orbit coupling and the
variable e-ph coupling g in the appearing second Fermi surface linked with the

The study of spin systems with disorder and frustration is known to be a
computationally hard task. Standard heuristics developed for optimizing and
sampling from general Ising Hamiltonians tend to produce correlated solutions
due to their locality, resulting in a suboptimal exploration of the search
space. To mitigate these effects, cluster Monte-Carlo methods are often
employed as they provide ways to perform non-local transformations on the
system. In this work, we investigate the Houdayer algorithm, a cluster
Monte-Carlo method with small numerical overhead which improves the exploration
of configurations by preserving the energy of the system. We propose a
generalization capable of reaching exponentially many configurations at the
same energy, while offering a high level of adaptability to ensure that no
biased choice is made. We discuss its applicability in various contexts,
including Markov chain Monte-Carlo sampling and as part of a genetic algorithm.
The performance of our generalization in these settings is illustrated by
sampling for the Ising model across different graph connectivities and by
solving instances of well-known binary optimization problems. We expect our
results to be of theoretical and practical relevance in the study of spin
glasses but also more broadly in discrete optimization, where a multitude of
problems follow the structure of Ising spin systems.

We investigate the effects of diamagnetic doping in the solid-solution series
$Tb_{1-x}Y_{x}(HCO_{2})_{3}$, in which the parent $Tb(HCO_{2})_{3}$ phase has
previously been shown to host a combination of frustrated and quasi-1D physics,
giving rise to a triangular Ising antiferromagnetic ground state that lacks
long range 3D order. Heat capacity measurements show three key features: (i) a
low temperature Schottky anomaly is observed, which is constant as a function
of x; (ii) the transition temperature and associated entropy change are both
surprisingly robust to diamagnetic doping; and (iii) an additional contribution
at T < 0.4 K appears with increasing x. The origin of this unusual behaviour is
rationalised in terms of the fragmentation of quasi-1D spin chains by the
diamagnetic $Y^{3+}$ dopant. Magnetocaloric measurements show a nonlinear
dependence on x. The mass-weighted magnetocaloric entropy decreases across the
series from the promising values in $Tb(HCO_{2})_{3}$; however, the
magnetocaloric entropy per magnetic $Tb^{3+}$ ion first decreases then
increases with increasing x. Our results establish $Tb_{1-x}Y_{x}(HCO_{2})_{3}$
as a model system in which to explore the functional ramifications of dilution

Mechanical waves that travel without inertia are often encountered in nature
-- e.g. motion of plants -- yet such waves remain rare in synthetic materials.
Here, we discover the emergence of slow kinks in overdamped metamaterials and
we show that they can be used for applications such as sensing, dynamic pattern
morphing and transport of objects. To do this, we create dissipative kirigami
with suitably patterned viscoelasticity. These kirigami shape-change into
different textures depending on how fast they are stretched. We find that if we
stretch fast and wait, the viscoelastic kirigami can eventually snap from one
texture to another. Crucially, such a snapping instability occurs in a sequence
and a travelling overdamped kink emerges. We demonstrate that such kink
underpins dynamic shape morphing in 2D kirigami and can be used to transport
objects. Our results open avenues for the use of slow kinks in metamaterials,
soft robotics and biomimicry.

We study flat bands and their topology in 2D materials with quadratic band
crossing points (QBCPs) under periodic strain. In contrast to Dirac points in
graphene, where strain acts as a vector potential, strain for QBCPs serves as a
director potential with angular momentum $\ell=2$. We prove that when the
strengths of the strain fields hit certain ``magic" values, exact flat bands
with $C=\pm 1$ emerge at charge neutrality point in the chiral limit, in strong
analogy to magic angle twisted bilayer graphene. These flat bands have ideal
quantum geometry for the realization of fractional Chern insulators, and they
are always fragile topological. The number of flat bands can be doubled for
certain point group, and the interacting Hamiltonian is exactly solvable at
integer fillings. We further demonstrate the stability of these flat bands
against deviations from the chiral limit, and discuss possible realization in
2D materials.

Fractionalization without time-reversal symmetry breaking is a long
sought-after goal that manifests non-trivial correlation effects. While exactly
solvable models offered many new theoretical insights, the physical realization
of time-reversal symmetric fractionalization remained out of reach. The earlier
proposal of correlated insulating states at $n \pm 1/3$ filling in twisted
bilayer graphene and recent experimental observations of insulating states at
those fillings strongly suggest that moir\'e graphene systems provide a new
platform to realize time-reversal symmetric fractionalized states. However, the
nature of fractional excitations and the effect of quantum fluctuation on the
fractional correlated insulating states are unknown. We show that excitations
of the fractional correlated insulator phases in the strong coupling limit
carry fractional charges and exhibit fractonic restricted mobility. Upon
introduction of quantum fluctuations, the resonance of ``lemniscate" structured
operators drives the system into ``quantum lemniscate liquid (QLL)" or
``quantum lemniscate solid (QLS)". We propose experimental strategies to
observe the fractons and discuss the theoretical implications of the QLL/QLS
phases.

We propose and demonstrate numerically a measurement scheme for complete
reconstruction of the quantum wavefunctions of Bose-Einstein condensates,
amplitude and phase, from a time of flight measurement. We identify a
fundamental ambiguity present in the measurement of vortices and show how to
overcome it by augmenting the measurement to allow reconstruction of
matter-wave vortices and arrays of vortices.

<h3>Slow fatigue and highly delayed yielding via shear banding in  oscillatory shear</h3>

We study theoretically the dynamical process of yielding in cyclically
sheared amorphous materials, within a thermal elastoplastic model and the soft
glassy rheology model. Within both models we find an initially slow
accumulation, over many cycles after the inception of shear, of low levels of
damage in the form strain heterogeneity across the sample. This slow fatigue
then suddenly gives way to catastrophic yielding and material failure. Strong
strain localisation in the form of shear banding is key to the failure
mechanism. We characterise in detail the dependence of the number of cycles
before failure on the amplitude of imposed strain, the working temperature, and
the degree to which the sample is annealed prior to shear. We discuss our
finding with reference to existing experiments and particle simulations, and
suggest new ones to test our predictions.

Shot noise measures out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations and is a powerful
tool to probe the nature of current-carrying excitations in quantum systems.
Recent shot noise measurements in the heavy fermion strange metal
YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a strong suppression of the Fano factor ($F$) -- the
ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system
is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely
strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of
diffusive metals in the regime of strong correlations. A Boltzmann-Langevin
equation formulation is constructed in a quasiparticle description in the
presence of strong correlations. We find that $F = \sqrt{ 3}/{4}$ in such a
correlation regime. Hence, the Fano factor suppression observed in experiments
on YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ necessitates a loss of the quasiparticles. Our work opens the
door to systematic theoretical studies of shot noise as a means of
characterizing strongly correlated metallic phases and materials.

Magnetic frustration can lead to peculiar magnetic orderings that break a
discrete symmetry of the lattice in addition to the fundamental magnetic
symmetries (i.e., spin rotation invariance and time-reversal symmetry). In this
work, we focus on frustrated quantum magnets and study the nature of the
quantum phase transition between a paramagnet and a magnetically ordered state
with broken threefold ($Z_3$) crystal rotation symmetry. We predict the
transition to happen in two stages, giving rise to an intermediate nematic
phase in which rotation symmetry is broken but the system remains magnetically
disordered. The nematic transition is described by the three-state Potts model.
This prediction is based on an analysis of bound states formed from two-magnon
excitations in the paramagnet, which become gapless while single-magnon
excitations remain gapped. By considering three different lattice models, we
demonstrate a generic instability towards two-magnon bound state formation in
the Potts-nematic nematic channel. We present both numerical results and a
general analytical perturbative formula for the bound state binding energy
similar to BCS theory. We further discuss a number of different materials that
realize key features of the model considered, and thus provide promising venues
for possible experimental observation.
