<h3>Many-body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect for Multipoles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04162</a>
<br>
<i>Jacopo Gliozzi, Giuseppe De Tomasi, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<p>In this work, we investigate the fate of the non-Hermitian skin effect in
one-dimensional systems that conserve the dipole moment and higher moments of
an associated global $\text{U}(1)$ charge. Motivated by field theoretical
arguments and lattice model calculations, we demonstrate that the key feature
of the non-Hermitian skin effect for $m$-pole conserving systems is the
generation of an $(m+1)$th multipole moment. For example, in contrast to the
conventional skin effect where charges are anomalously localized at one
boundary, the dipole-conserving skin effect results in charges localized at
both boundaries, in a configuration that generates an extremal quadrupole
moment. In addition, we explore the dynamical consequences of the $m$-pole skin
effect, focusing on charge and entanglement propagation. Both numerically and
analytically, we provide evidence that long-time steady-states have Fock-space
localization and an area-law scaling of entanglement entropy, which serve as
quantum indicators of the skin effect.

<h3>"Quantum Geometric Nesting'' and Solvable Model Flat-Band Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04163" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04163</a>
<br>
<i>Zhaoyu Han, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, B. Andrei Bernevig, Steven A. Kivelson</i>
<p>We introduce the concept of ``quantum geometric nesting'' (QGN) to
characterize the idealized ordering tendencies of certain flat-band systems
implicit in the geometric structure of the flat-band subspace. Perfect QGN
implies the existence of an infinite class of local interactions that can be
explicitly constructed and give rise to solvable ground states with various
forms of possible fermion bi-linear order, including flavor ferromagnetism,
density waves, and superconductivity. For the ideal Hamiltonians constructed in
this way, we show that certain aspects of the low-energy spectrum can also be
exactly computed including, in the superconducting case, the phase stiffness.
Examples of perfect QGN include flat bands with certain symmetries (e.g. chiral
or time-reversal), and non-symmetry-related cases exemplified with an
engineered model for pair-density-wave. Extending this approach, we obtain
exact superconducting ground states with nontrivial pairing symmetry.

<h3>Universal relation between energy gap and dielectric constant</h3>

<br>
<i>Yugo Onishi, Liang Fu</i>
<p>A universal inequality between the energy gap and the dielectric constant for
all insulating states is derived. The gap bound derived from the inequality is
demonstrated for a wide range of materials and compared with the measured gap
value. A remarkable case is cubic boron nitride, in which the direct gap
reaches 72% of the bound.

<h3>Tucker tensor approach for accelerating exchange computations in a  real-space finite-element discretization of generalized Kohn-Sham density  functional theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04189" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04189</a>
<br>
<i>Vishal Subramanian, Sambit Das, Vikram Gavini</i>
<p>The evaluation of Fock exchange is often the computationally most expensive
part of hybrid functional density functional theory calculations in a
systematically improvable, complete basis. In this work, we employ a Tucker
tensor based approach that substantially accelerates the evaluation of the
action of Fock exchange by transforming 3-dimensional convolutional integrals
into a tensor product of 1-dimensional convolution integrals. Our numerical
implementation uses a parallelization strategy that balances the memory and
communication bottlenecks, alongside overalapping compute and communication
operations to enhance computational efficiency and parallel scalability. The
accuracy and computational efficiency is demonstrated on various systems,
including Pt clusters of various sizes and a $\text{TiO}_{\text{2}}$ cluster
with 3,684 electrons.

<h3>Dense Hopfield Networks in the Teacher-Student Setting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04191" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04191</a>
<br>
<i>Robin Thériault, Daniele Tantari</i>
<p>Dense Hopfield networks are known for their feature to prototype transition
and adversarial robustness. However, previous theoretical studies have been
mostly concerned with their storage capacity. We bridge this gap by studying
the phase diagram of p-body Hopfield networks in the teacher-student setting of
an unsupervised learning problem, uncovering ferromagnetic phases reminiscent
of the prototype and feature learning regimes. On the Nishimori line, we find
the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern
retrieval. Interestingly, we find that that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic
transition of the teacher-student setting coincides with the paramagnetic to
spin-glass transition of the direct model, i.e. with random patterns. Outside
of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to
the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a
larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive
tolerance to noise. We then derive a closed-form expression measuring the
adversarial robustness of such a student at zero temperature, corroborating the
positive correlation between number of parameters and robustness observed in
large neural networks. We also use our model to clarify why the prototype phase
of modern Hopfield networks is adversarially robust.

<h3>Schrödinger cats escape confinement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04193" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04193</a>
<br>
<i>A. Krasznai, G. Takács</i>
<p>We consider local quenches from initial states generated by a single spin
flip in either the true or the false vacuum state of the confining quantum
Ising spin chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Contrary to global quenches,
where the light-cone behaviour is strongly suppressed, we find a significant
light-cone signal propagating with a nonzero velocity besides the expected
localised oscillating component. Combining an analytic representation of the
initial state with a numerical description of the relevant excitations using
the two-fermion approximation, we can construct the spectrum of post-quench
excitations and their overlaps with the initial state, identifying the
underlying mechanism. For confining quenches built upon the true vacuum, the
propagating signal consists of Schr{\"o}dinger cats of left and right-moving
mesons escaping confinement. In contrast, for anti-confining quenches built
upon the false vacuum, it is composed of Schr{\"o}dinger cats of left and
right-moving bubbles which escape Wannier-Stark localisation.

<h3>Cooper quartets designing in multi-terminal superconducting devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04202" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04202</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Chirolli, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto</i>
<p>Quantum design of Cooper quartets in a double quantum dot system coupled to
ordinary superconducting leads is presented as a novel platform for the study
of an elusive many-body state of matter, that is at the basis of the phenomenon
of charge-$4e$ superconductivity. A fundamentally novel, maximally correlated
ground state, in the form of a superposition of vacuum $|0\rangle$ and
four-electron state $|4e\rangle$, emerges as a narrow resonance and it is
promoted by an attractive interdot interaction. A novel phenomenology in the
dissipationless transport regime is elucidated, that yields typical flux
quantization in units of $h/4e$ and manifests in non-local multi-terminal
coherence and in two-Cooper pair transport properties mediated by the quartet
ground state. The results open the way to the exploration of correlation
effects and non-local coherence in hybrid superconducting devices,
parity-protected quantum computing schemes and more generally, the work poses
the basis for the design and simulation of novel correlated states of matter
starting from ordinary ingredients available in a quantum solid state lab.

<h3>The Kondo effect in the quantum $XX$ spin chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04207" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04207</a>
<br>
<i>Pradip Kattel, Yicheng Tang, J. H. Pixley, Natan Andrei</i>
<p>We investigate the boundary phenomena that arise in a finite-size $XX$ spin
chain interacting through an $XX$ interaction with a spin$-\frac{1}{2}$
impurity located at its edge. Upon Jordan-Wigner transformation, the model is
described by a quadratic Fermionic Hamiltonian. Our work displays, within this
ostensibly simple model, the emergence of the Kondo effect, a quintessential
hallmark of strongly correlated physics. We also show how the Kondo cloud
shrinks and turns into a single particle bound state as the impurity coupling
increases beyond a critical value. Using both \textit{Bethe Ansatz} and
\textit{exact diagonalization} techniques, we show that the local moment of the
impurity is screened by different mechanisms depending on the ratio of the
boundary and bulk coupling. When the ratio falls below the critical value
$\sqrt{2}$, the impurity is screened via the multiparticle Kondo effect.
However, when the ratio between the coupling exceeds the critical value , a
bound mode is formed at the impurity site which screens the spin of the
impurity. We show that the boundary phase transition is reflected in local
ground state properties by calculating the spinon density of states, the
magnetization at the impurity site in the presence of a global magnetic field,
and the finite temperature susceptibility. We find that the spinon density of
states in the Kondo phase has the characteristic Lorentzian peak that moves
from the Fermi level to the maximum energy of the spinon as the impurity
coupling is increased and becomes a localized bound mode in the bound mode
phase. Moreover, the impurity magnetization and the finite temperature impurity
susceptibility behave differently in the two phases. When the boundary coupling
$J_{\mathrm{imp}}$ exceeds the critical value $\sqrt{2}J$, the model is no
longer boundary conformal invariant as a massive bound mode appears at the
impurity site.

<h3>Comments regarding Transonic dislocation propagation in diamond by  Katagiri, et al. (Science 382, 69-72, 2023)</h3>

<p>We have carefully examined the above-referenced paper and find the claims of
stacking fault formation and transonic dislocation propagation in diamond to be
not valid. Additionally, it is quite puzzling that 14 authors on this paper are
also co-authors on another recent paper that directly conflicts with the

<h3>Force Propagation in Active Cytoskeletal Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04217</a>
<br>
<i>Shichen Liu, Wenshan Pan, Heun Jin Lee, Shahriar Shadkhoo, Fan Yang, Chunhe Li, Zijie Qu, Matt Thomson</i>
<p>In biological systems, molecular-scale forces and motions are pivotal for
enabling processes like motility, shape change, and replication. These forces
and motions are organized, amplified, and transmitted across macroscopic scales
by active materials such as the cytoskeleton, which drives micron-scale
cellular movement and re-organization. Despite the integral role of active
materials, understanding how molecular-scale interactions alter macroscopic
structure and force propagation remains elusive. This knowledge gap presents
challenges to the harnessing and regulation of such dynamics across diverse
length scales. Here, we demonstrate how mediating the bundling of microtubules
can shift active matter between a global force-transmitting phase and a local
force-dissipating phase. A fivefold increase in microtubule effective length
results in the transition from local to global phase with a hundredfold
increase in velocity autocorrelation. Through theory and simulation, we
identify signatures of a percolation-driven transition between the two phases.
This provides evidence for how force propagation can be generated when local
molecular interactions reach a sufficient length scale. We show that force
propagation in the active matter system enables material transport.
Consequently, we demonstrate that the global phase is capable of facilitating
millimeter-scale human cell transport and manipulation, as well as powering the
movement of aqueous droplets. These findings underscore the potential for
designing active materials capable of force organization and transmission. Our
results lay the foundation for further exploration into the organization and
propagation of forces/stresses in biological systems, thereby paving the way
for the engineering of active materials in synthetic biology and soft robotics.

<h3>Ferromagnetic Materials for Josephson π Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04219</a>
<br>
<i>Norman O. Birge, Nathan Satchell</i>
<p>The past two decades have seen an explosion of work on Josephson junctions
containing ferromagnetic materials. Such junctions are under consideration for
applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. In the presence of
the strong exchange field, spin-singlet Cooper pairs from conventional
superconductors undergo rapid oscillations in phase as they propagate through a
ferromagnetic material. As a result, the ground-state phase difference across a
ferromagnetic Josephson junction oscillates between 0 and $\pi$ as a function
of the thickness of the ferromagnetic material. $\pi$-junctions have been
proposed as circuit elements in superconducting digital logic and in certain
qubit designs for quantum computing. If a junction contains two or more
ferromagnetic layers whose relative magnetization directions can be controlled
by a small applied magnetic field, then the junction can serve as the
foundation for a memory cell. Success in all of those applications requires
careful choices of ferromagnetic materials. Often, materials that optimize
magnetic properties do not optimize supercurrent propagation, and vice versa.
In this review we discuss the significant progress that has been made in
identifying and testing a wide range of ferromagnetic materials in Josephson
junctions over the past two decades. The review concentrates on metals, not
only because that is the area of the authors' expertise, but also because
eventual industrial applications of ferromagnetic Josephson junctions will most
likely start with metals. We will briefly mention some of the exciting work on
spin-triplet supercurrent in junctions containing noncollinear magnetic
inhomogeneity, but that topic is not the focus of the review.

<h3>Observation of quantum oscillations in the extreme weak anharmonic limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04227</a>
<br>
<i>A. Théry, B. Neukelmance, B. Hue, W. Legrand, L. Jarjat, J. Craquelin, M. Villiers, A. Cottet, M.R. Delbecq, T. Kontos</i>
<p>We investigate a granular aluminium quantum circuit with an anharmonicity of
the order of its decoherence rate in a 3-dimensional microwave cavity. We
perform single qubit-like manipulations such as Rabi oscillations and Ramsey
fringes. Our findings, supported by quantitative numerical modeling, show that
a very weakly anharmonic oscillator can also display quantum oscillations
outside the qubit regime. These oscillations are hard to disambiguate from
qubit oscillations in time domain measurements for a single driving frequency.
This sheds new light on recent findings for new material superconducting
quantum bits. Our platform shows in addition large magnetic field resilience
which could find applications for quantum enhanced dark matter search.

<h3>3D Tensor Renormalisation Group at High Temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04229</a>
<br>
<i>Nikolay Ebel</i>
<p>Building upon previous $2D$ studies, this research focuses on describing $3D$
tensor renormalisation group (RG) flows for lattice spin systems, such as the
Ising model. We present a novel RG map, which operates on tensors with
infinite-dimensional legs and does not involve truncations, in contrast to
numerical tensor RG maps. To construct this map, we developed new techniques
for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map
contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the
high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model. This leads to the iterated RG
map convergence in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to $A_*$ when initialised in the
vicinity of $A_*$. This work provides the first steps towards the rigorous
understanding of tensor RG maps in $3D$.

<h3>Electron quantum optics in graphene</h3>

<i>Himadri Chakraborti, Cosimo Gorini, Angelika Knothe, Ming-Hao Liu, Péter Makk, Francois D. Parmentier, David Perconte, Klaus Richter, Preden Roulleau, Benjamin Sacépé, Christian Schönenberger, Wenmin Yang</i>
<p>In the last decade, graphene has become an exciting platform for electron
optical experiments, in many aspects superior to conventional two-dimensional
electron gases (2DEGs). A major advantage, besides the ultra-large mobilities,
is the fine control over the electrostatics, which gives the possibility of
realising gap-less and compact p-n interfaces with high precision. The latter
host non-trivial states, \eg, snake states in moderate magnetic fields, and
serve as building blocks of complex electron interferometers. Thanks to the
Dirac spectrum and its non-trivial Berry phase, the internal (valley and
sublattice) degrees of freedom, and the possibility to tailor the band
structure using proximity effects, such interferometers open up a completely
new playground based on novel device architectures. In this review, we
introduce the theoretical background of graphene electron optics, fabrication
methods used to realise electron-optical devices, and techniques for
corresponding numerical simulations. Based on this, we give a comprehensive
review of ballistic transport experiments and simple building blocks of
electron optical devices both in single and bilayer graphene, highlighting the
novel physics that is brought in compared to conventional 2DEGs. After
describing the different magnetic field regimes in graphene p-n junctions and
nanostructures, we conclude by discussing the state of the art in
graphene-based Mach-Zender and Fabry-Perot interferometers.

<h3>Hybrid skyrmion and anti-skyrmion phases in polar $C_{\rm 4v}$ systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04245" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04245</a>
<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>We investigate the stability of the skyrmion crystal phase in a tetragonal
polar system with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by focusing on the
symmetry of ordering wave vectors forming the skyrmion crystal. Our analysis is
based on numerical simulations for an effective spin model, which is derived
from the weak-coupling regime in the Kondo lattice model on a polar square
lattice. We show that a hybrid square skyrmion crystal consisting of Bloch and
N\'eel spin textures emerges even under polar $C_{\rm 4v}$ symmetries when the
ordering wave vectors correspond to low-symmetric wave vectors in momentum
space, which is in contrast to the expectation from the Lifshitz invariants. We
also show the instability toward the anti-skyrmion crystal and rhombic skyrmion
crystal depending on the direction of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector in
momentum space. Furthermore, we show that the regions of the skyrmion crystal
phases are affected by taking into account the symmetric anisotropic exchange
interaction. Our results open the potential direction of engineering the hybrid
skyrmion crystal and anti-skyrmion crystal phases in polar magnets.

<h3>Hyperelastic swelling of tough hydrogels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04251</a>
<br>
<i>Jing Wang, Justin C. Burton</i>
<p>Hydrogels are biphasic, swollen polymer networks where elastic deformation is
coupled to nanoscale fluid flow. As a consequence, hydrogels can withstand
large strains and exhibit nonlinear, hyperelastic properties. For low-modulus
hydrogel and semiflexible biopolymer networks, previous studies have shown that
these materials universally contract when sheared on timescales much longer
than the poroelastic relaxation timescale. Using rheological and tribological
measurements, we find that tough polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid hydrogels,
with moduli of order ~10-100 kPa, exclusively exhibit dilatancy when sheared.
The poroelastic relaxation process was examined using strain-controlled
compression, indicating a diffusion constant of order 10^-9 m^2/s. On short
timescales (minutes), an applied shear stress induced an increase in normal
stress that varied quadratically with shear strain. At long timescales (hours),
creep experiments revealed that tough hydrogels can ``remember'' the initial
direction of applied shear, suggesting an evolution of the polymer network.
Moreover, we show that this dilatant behavior manifests as swelling during
tribological sliding, imbibing the hydrogel with fluid. We suggest that this
inherent, hyperelastic dilatancy is an important feature in all tough
hydrogels, and may explain rehydration and mechanical rejuvenation in
biological tissues such as cartilage.

<h3>Shear deformation in CuZr metallic glass: A statistical and complex  network analysis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04252" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04252</a>
<br>
<i>Fernando Corvacho, Victor Muñoz, Matias Sepulveda-Macias, Gonzalo Gutierrez</i>
<p>We have implemented a complex network description for metallic glasses, able
to predict the elasto-plastic regime, the location of shear bands and the
statistics that controls the plastic events that originate in the material due
to a deformation process. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we
perform a shear deformation test, obtaining the stress-strain curve for CuZr
metallic glass samples. The atomic configurations of the metallic glass are
mapped to a graph, where a node represents an atom whose stress/strain is above
a certain threshold, and edges are connections between existing nodes at
consecutive timesteps in the simulation. We made a statistical study of some
physical descriptors such as shear stress, shear strain, volumetric strain and
non-affine displacement to use them as construction tools for complex networks.
We have calculated their probability density functions, skewness, kurtosis and
gini coefficient to analyze the inequality of the distributions. We study the
evolution of the resulting complex network, by computing topological metrics
such as degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness and closeness centrality as
a function of the strain. We have obtained correlations between the physical
phenomena produced by the deformation with the data recorded by these metrics.
By means the visual representation of the networks, we have also found direct
correlations between metrics and the local atomic shear strain, so that they
are able to predict the location of shear bands, as well as the formation of
highly connected and interacting communities, which we interpret as shear
transformation zones. Our results suggest that the complex network approach has
interesting capabilities for the description of mechanical properties of
metallic glasses.

<h3>Optical properties and electronic correlations in  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$ bilayer nickelates under high pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04258" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04258</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Geisler, Laura Fanfarillo, James J. Hamlin, Gregory R. Stewart, Richard G. Hennig, P.J. Hirschfeld</i>
<p>We explore the optical properties of La3Ni2O7$-\delta$ bilayer nickelates
($\delta = 0, 0.25$) by using density functional theory including a Coulomb
repulsion term. On-site correlation effects are found to considerably impact
the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization and the optical conductivity. Remarkable
agreement with recent experimental spectra at ambient pressure is achieved for
$U \sim 3$ eV, which simultaneously provides an electronic structure consistent
with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and accurate lattice parameters.
The renormalizations of the optical spectrum induced by explicit oxygen
vacancies, which form predominantly at the inner apical sites, further improve
the agreement with experiment, and the concomitant electron doping is largely
accommodated by a defect state. We show that the structural transition
occurring under high pressure leads to a quenched low-energy in-plane spectral
weight due to vanishing octahedral rotations. Simultaneously, a significant
reduction of the out-of-plane component acts as a fingerprint of the emerging
hole pocket. Comparison with infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$ uncovers a substantially
enhanced optical response and anisotropy for the bilayer compound, reflecting
fundamental differences in the electronic structure. This comprehensive study
suggests the notion of rather moderate electronic correlations in this novel
high-$T_c$ superconductor.

<h3>Flexible thermoelectrics in crossed graphene/hBN composites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04274" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04274</a>
<br>
<i>M.Amir Bazrafshan, Farhad Khoeini</i>
<p>Nanostructures exhibit unusual properties due to the dominance of quantum
mechanical effects. In addition, the geometry of a nanostructure can have a
strong influence on its physical properties. Using the tight-binding (TB) and
force-constant (FC) approaches with the help of the non-equilibrium Green's
function (NEGF) method, the transport and thermoelectric properties of
cross-shaped (X-shaped) composite heterostructures are studied in two cases:
Mixed graphene and h-BN (HETX-CBN) and all graphene (HETX-C) cross-shaped
structures. Our numerical results show that an X-shaped structure helps to
manipulate its electronic and phononic properties. The transport energy gap can
be tuned in the range of ~0.8 eV by changing one arm width. Due to the drastic
decrease in the electronic conductance of HETX-CBN and the dominance of the
phononic thermal conductance, the ZT performance is degraded despite the high S
value (in the order of meV). However, HETX-C has better ZT performance due to
better electronic conductance and lower phononic/electronic thermal ratio, it
can enhance the ZT ~2.5 times compared to that of zigzag graphene nanoribbon.
The thermoelectric properties of the system can be tuned by controlling the
size of the arms of the device and the type of its atoms.

<h3>The Bosonic Quantum Breakdown Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04309" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04309</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Min Hu, Biao Lian</i>
<p>We propose a bosonic quantum breakdown Hubbard model, which generalizes the
Bose-Hubbard model by adding an asymmetric breakdown interaction turning one
boson into two between adjacent sites. We show that the ground state undergoes
a first-order phase transition from Mott insulator to breakdown condensate as
the breakdown interaction increases. When the normal hopping is zero, this
model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by
the breakdown condensate, while the Mott-condensate transition remains first
order. Surprisingly, the breakdown condensate with spontaneously broken
exponential U(1) symmetry does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which
invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable spontaneous symmetry
breaking in 1D. Moreover, we show that the model at non-equilibrium exhibits a
dynamical transition from dielectric phase to breakdown phase with respect to
the breakdown interaction. Our results show that quantum systems with
exponential symmetry can exhibit novel unexpected properties.

<h3>New twisted van der Waals fabrication method based on strongly adhesive  polymer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04313" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04313</a>
<br>
<i>Giung Park, Suhan Son, Jongchan Kim, Yunyeong Chang, Kaixuan Zhang, Miyoung Kim, Jieun Lee, Je-Geun Park</i>
<p>Observations of emergent quantum phases in twisted bilayer graphene prompted
a flurry of activities in van-der-Waals (vdW) materials beyond graphene. Most
current twisted experiments use a so-called tear-and-stack method using a
polymer called PPC. However, despite the clear advantage of the current PPC
tear-and-stack method, there are also technical limitations, mainly a limited
number of vdW materials that can be studied using this PPC-based method. This
technical bottleneck has been preventing further development of the exciting
field beyond a few available vdW samples. To overcome this challenge and
facilitate future expansion, we developed a new tear-and-stack method using a
strongly adhesive polycaprolactone (PCL). With similar angular accuracy, our
technology allows fabrication without a capping layer, facilitating surface
analysis and ensuring inherently clean interfaces and low operating
temperatures. More importantly, it can be applied to many other vdW materials
that have remained inaccessible with the PPC-based method. We present our
results on twist homostructures made with a wide choice of vdW materials - from
two well-studied vdW materials (graphene and MoS$_2$) to the first-ever
demonstrations of other vdW materials (NbSe$_2$, NiPS$_3$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$).
Therefore, our new technique will help expand $moir\acute{e}$ physics beyond
few selected vdW materials and open up more exciting developments.

<p>Superlattice potential modulation can produce flat minibands in
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. In this work we study how band topology and
interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in this system are controlled by
tuning the displacement field and the shape and strength of the superlattice
potential. We use an analytic perturbative analysis to demonstrate that
topological flat bands are favored by a honeycomb-lattice-shaped potential, and
numerics to show that the robustness of topological bands depends on both the
displacement field strength and the periodicity of the superlattice potential.
At integer fillings of the topological flat bands, the strength of the
displacement field and the superlattice potential tune phase transitions
between quantum anomalous Hall insulator, trivial insulator, and metallic
states. We present mean-field phase diagrams in a gate voltage parameter space
at filling factor $\nu=1$, and discuss the prospects of realizing quantum
anomalous Hall insulators and fractional Chern insulators when the superlattice
potential modulation is produced by dielectric patterning or adjacent moir\'e
materials.

<h3>Kibble-Zurek scalings and coarsening laws in slowly quenched classical  Ising chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04342" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04342</a>

<i>Lakshita Jindal, Kavita Jain</i>
<p>We consider a one-dimensional classical ferromagnetic Ising model when it is
quenched from a low temperature to zero temperature in finite time using
Glauber or Kawasaki dynamics. Most of the previous work on finite-time quenches
assume that the system is initially in equilibrium and focus on the excess
defect density at the end of the quench which decays algebraically in quench
time with Kibble-Zurek exponent. Here we are interested in understanding the
conditions under which the Kibble-Zurek scalings do not hold and in elucidating
the full dynamics of the defect density. We find that depending on the initial
conditions and quench time, the dynamics of the defect density can be
characterized by coarsening and/or the standard finite-time quench dynamics
involving adiabatic evolution and Kibble-Zurek dynamics; the time scales for
crossover between these dynamical phases are determined by coarsening time and
stationary state relaxation time. As a consequence, the defect density at the
end of the quench is either a constant or decays following coarsening laws or
Kibble-Zurek scaling. For the Glauber chain, we formulate a low temperature
scaling theory and find exact expressions for the final defect density for
various initial conditions. For the Kawasaki chain where the dynamic exponents
for coarsening and stationary state dynamics are different, we verify the above
findings numerically and also examine the effect of unequal dynamic exponents.

<h3>Unbiased Atomistic Predictions of Crystal Dislocation Dynamics using  Bayesian Force Fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04359</a>
<br>
<i>Cameron J. Owen, Amirhossein D. Naghdi, Anders Johansson, Dario Massa, Stefanos Papanikolaou, Boris Kozinsky</i>
<p>Crystal dislocation dynamics, especially at high temperatures, represents a
subject where experimental phenomenological input is commonly required, and
parameter-free predictions, starting from quantum methods, have been beyond
reach. This is especially true for phenomena like stacking faults and
dislocation cross-slip, which are computationally intractable with methods like
density functional theory, as $\sim 10^5-10^6$ atoms are required to reliably
simulate such systems. Hence, this work extends quantum-mechanical accuracy to
mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations and opens unprecedented possibilities
in material design for extreme mechanical conditions with direct atomistic
insight at the deformation mesoscale. To accomplish this, we construct a
Bayesian machine-learned force field (MLFF) from ab initio quantum training
data, enabling direct observations of high-temperature and high-stress
dislocation dynamics in single-crystalline Cu with atomistic resolution. In
doing so, a generalizable training protocol is developed for construction of
MLFFs for dislocation kinetics, with wide-ranging applicability to other single
element systems and alloys. The resulting FLARE MLFF provides excellent
predictions of static bulk elastic properties, stacking fault widths and
energies, dynamic evolutions and mobilities of edge and screw dislocations, as
well as cross-slip energy barriers for screw dislocations, all of which are
compared to available experimental measurements. This work marks the first
reliable quantitative determination of dislocation mobilities and cross-slip
barriers, demonstrating a substantial advancement over previous empirical and
machine learned force field models.

<br>
<i>Fereshteh L. Memarian, Derek Hammar, Md Mainul Hasan Sabbir, Mark Elias, Kevin A. Mitchell, Linda Hirst</i>
<p>This work examines self-mixing in active nematics, a class of fluids in which
mobile topological defects drive chaotic flows in a system comprised of
biological filaments and molecular motors. We present experiments that
demonstrate how geometrical confinement can influence the braiding dynamics of
the defects. Notably, we show that confinement in cardioid-shaped wells leads
to realization of the golden braid, a maximally efficient mixing state of
exactly three defects with no defect creation or annihilation. We characterize
the golden braid state using different measures of topological entropy and the
Lyapunov exponent. In particular, topological entropy measured from the
stretching rate of material lines agrees well with an analytical computation
from braid theory. Increasing the size of the confining cardioid produces a
transition from the golden braid, to the fully chaotic active turbulent state.

<p>Low-temperature scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) are critical for the study
of quantum materials and quantum information science. Due to the rising costs
of helium, cryogen-free cryostats have become increasingly desirable. However,
they typically suffer from comparatively worse vibrations than cryogen-based
systems, necessitating the understanding and mitigation of vibrations for SPM
applications. Here we demonstrate the construction of two cryogen-free dilution
refrigerator SPMs with minimal modifications to the factory default and we
systematically characterize their vibrational performance. We measure the
absolute vibrations at the microscope stage with geophones, and use both
microwave impedance microscopy and a scanning single electron transistor to
independently measure tip-sample vibrations. Additionally, we implement
customized filtering and thermal anchoring schemes, and characterize the
cooling power at the scanning stage and the tip electron temperature. This work
serves as a reference to researchers interested in cryogen-free SPMs, as such
characterization is not standardized in the literature or available from
manufacturers.

<h3>Dislocation assisted coarsening of coherent precipitates: a phase field  study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04382" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04382</a>
<br>
<i>Arjun Varma R, Prita Pant, M P Gururajan</i>
<p>Coarsening of precipitates in coherent systems is influenced by the elastic
fields of the precipitates and the interfacial curvature. It is also known that
if precipitates are connected by dislocations, coarsening is affected by the
elastic fields of the dislocations and the pipe diffusivity. Although there is
experimental evidence of accelerated coarsening in the presence of
dislocations, these studies do not capture the effect of the elastic fields.
There exist generic theoretical models that can predict the average sizes and
size distributions of coarsening precipitates considering the coherency related
elastic stress fields. In this paper, we use a phase field model to study the
coarsening of precipitates connected by dislocations, incorporating its elastic
fields and pipe diffusivity. Specifically, we study the effects of misfit
strain, elastic moduli mismatch, faster pipe mobility and the elastic fields of
the dislocation on the morphology and kinetics of the coarsening precipitates.
The dilatational component, associated with the edge character of the
dislocations interact with the precipitates in an elastically homogeneous
system. In an elastically inhomogeneous system, the deviatoric elastic fields
also interact with the precipitates influencing the morphology and kinetics of
coarsening precipitates. The kinetics of coarsening is different as well, with
hard precipitates coarsening faster as compared to soft precipitates, when
connected by dislocations. Further, we note that the modified Gibbs-Thomson
equation, which was originally derived for an isolated precipitate in an
infinite matrix, is also applicable for coarsening precipitates at close
proximity.

<h3>Geometrical frustration in nonlinear mechanics of screw dislocation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04392" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04392</a>
<br>
<i>Shunsuke Kobayashi, Ryuichi Tarumi</i>
<p>The existence of stress singularities and reliance on linear approximations
pose significant challenges in comprehending the stress field generation
mechanism around dislocations. This study employs differential geometry and
calculus of variations to mathematically model and numerically analyse screw
dislocations. The kinematics of the dislocation are expressed by the
diffeomorphism of the Riemann--Cartan manifold, which includes both the
Riemannian metric and affine connection. The modelling begins with a continuous
distribution of dislocation density, which is transformed into torsion $\tau$
through the Hodge duality. The plasticity functional is constructed by applying
the Helmholtz decomposition to bundle isomorphism, which is equivalent to the
Cartan first structure equation for the intermediate configuration
$\mathcal{B}$. The current configuration is derived by the elastic embedding of
$\mathcal{B}$ into the standard Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The numerical
analysis reveals the elastic stress fields effectively eliminate the
singularity along the dislocation line and exhibit excellent conformity with
Volterra's theory beyond the dislocation core. Geometrical frustration is the
direct source of dislocation stress fields, as demonstrated through the
multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradients. By leveraging the
mathematical properties of the Riemann--Cartan manifold, we demonstrate that
the Ricci curvature determines the symmetry of stress fields. These results
substantiate a long-standing mathematical hypothesis: the duality between
stress and curvature.

<h3>Monolayer Fe$_{3}$GaX$_{2}$ (X=I, Br, Sb): high-temperature  two-dimensional magnets and a novel partially ordered spin state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04399" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04399</a>
<br>
<i>Qiuhao Wang, Xinlong Yang, Fawei Zheng, Ping Zhang</i>
<p>We systematically investigated the effects of charge doping and strain on
monolayer Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, and proposed three new novel two-dimensional magnetic
materials: monolayer Fe$_3$GaX$_2$ (X=I, Br, Sb). We found that both strain and
charge doping can tune the magnetic interactions, and the tuning by charge
doping is more significant. Differential charge analysis revealed that the
doped charges predominantly accumulate around Te atoms. Based on this insight,
we introduced Fe$_{3}$GaI$_{2}$, Fe$_{3}$GaBr$_{2}$, and Fe$_{3}$GaSb$_{2}$
monolayers. The Fe$_{3}$GaI$_{2}$ and Fe$_{3}$GaBr$_{2}$ monolayers contain I
and Br atoms rather than Te atoms, emulate electron-doped Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$
monolayer, resulting in notably high T$_c$ values of 867 K and 844 K,
respectively. In contrast, the Fe$_3$GaSb$_2$ monolayer mimics hole-doped
Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$ monolayer, presents a mix of FM and antiferromagnetic
interactions, manifesting a distinctive partially ordered magnetic state. Our
study demonstrates that substitution atoms based on the charge-doping effect
offer a promising approach for predicting new magnetic materials. The proposed
Fe$_{3}$GaI$_{2}$, Fe$_{3}$GaBr$_{2}$, and Fe$_{3}$GaSb$_{2}$ monolayers hold
great potential for spintronics applications, and may stimulate the pursuit of
new types of spin liquid.

<h3>Electronic effects in radiation-induced collision cascades in nickel</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04404" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04404</a>
<br>
<i>Andrea E. Sand, Glen P. Kiely, Artur Tamm, Alfredo A. Correa</i>
<p>The accurate treatment of electronic effects in multi-million atom
simulations of radiation-induced collision cascades is crucial for reliable
predictions of primary radiation damage. In this work, we explore the
performance of a recently developed two-temperature molecular dynamics model
implementing an electron density-dependent coupling of electronic and atomic
subsystems for cascade simulations in nickel. We show that the parameter-free
model realistically captures the instantaneous energy losses during all stages
of the highly non-equilibrium cascade process. Simulations predict two distinct
coupling regimes, corresponding to the rapid electronic stopping energy losses
in the early stages of the cascade and to the electron-phonon coupling
mechanism in the later stages, without the use of separate coupling terms. The
intermediate stage of the cascade dynamics displays a complex energy transfer
between the subsystems, which cannot be validated by comparison to either
electronic stopping or electron-phonon coupling theories. We therefore compare
the predicted atomic mixing, which is sensitive to the energy losses during the
intermediate cascade stage, with experimental ion beam mixing measurements. We
find good agreement with the experiments, validating the coupling model for the
intermediate stage of cascades. Predictions of final defect numbers and cluster
sizes are found in line with the predictions of conventional electronic
stopping-based methods, while significantly reducing the theoretical
uncertainty in the predictions of conventional models stemming from arbitrary
choices of thresholds for different coupling terms. Our results represent a
notable improvement in cascade damage predictions in nickel, providing
validation of the electron density-dependent coupling model for radiation
damage simulations in general.

<h3>Spin current leakage and Onsager reciprocity in interfacial spin-charge  interconversion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04413</a>
<br>
<i>Aurelien Manchon, Shuyuan Shi, Hyunsoo Yang</i>
<p>Experimental investigations of spin-charge interconversion in magnetic
bilayers comprising a ferromagnet adjacent to a topological insulator have
reported scattered results on the spin-charge and charge-spin conversion
efficiency. Attempting to reconcile these contradicting experimental results,
we develop a phenomenological theory of spin-charge interconversion accounting
for both interfacial interconversion through the spin galvanic effect, also
called the Rashba-Edelstein effect, as well as bulk interconversion via the
spin Hall effect. We find that the spin current leakage into the nonmagnetic
metal plays a central role during the spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin
conversion, leading to dissymmetric interconversion processes. In particular,
spin-to-charge conversion is much less sensitive to the spin current absorption
in the nonmagnetic metal than charge-to-spin conversion. This suggests that
spin pumping is a more trustable technique to extract the interfacial Rashba
parameter than spin-orbit torque.

<h3>Band Geometry Induced High-Angular Momentum Excitonic Superfluid in  Gapped Chiral Fermion Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04416" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04416</a>
<br>
<i>Huaiyuan Yang, Yuelin Shao, Xi Dai, Xin-Zheng Li</i>
<p>We study the exciton condensation in the heterostructures where the electron
layer and hole layer formed by gapped chiral Fermion (GCF) systems are
separately gated. High-angular momentum such as p- and d-wave like excitonic
pairing may emerge when the gap of the GCF systems is small compared to the
Fermi energy, and the chiral winding number of the electrons and holes are the
same. This is a result of the non-trivial band geometry and can be linked to
the Berry curvature when projected onto the Fermi surface. In realistic
systems, we propose that staggered graphene and magnetic topological surface
states are promising candidates for realizing p-wave exciton superfluid, and
anomalous Hall conductivity can be used as a signature in experiments.

<i>Koji Kudo, Ryota Nakai, Kentaro Nomura</i>
<p>Quantum-Hall--Superconductor hybrids have been predicted to exhibit various
types of topological order, providing possible platforms for intrinsically
fault-tolerant quantum computing. In this paper, we develop a formulation to
construct this hybrid system on a sphere, a useful geometry for identifying
topologically ordered states due to its compact and contractible nature. As a
preliminary step using this framework, we investigate disorder effects on the
Rashba-coupled quantum Hall system combined with the type-II superconductor. By
diagonalizing the BdG Hamiltonian projected into a Rashba-coupled Landau level,
we demonstrate the emergence of a topological superconducting phase resulting
from disorders and proximity-induced pairing. Distinctive gapless modes appear
in the real-space entanglement spectrum, which is consistent with topological
superconductivity.

<h3>Coexistence of large anomalous Nernst effect and large coercive force in  amorphous ferrimagnetic TbCo alloy films</h3>

<br>
<i>Miho Odagiri, Hiroto Imaeda, Ahmet Yagmur, Yuichiro Kurokawa, Satoshi Sumi, Hiroyuki Awano, Kenji Tanabe</i>
<p>The Anomalous Nernst Effect (ANE) has garnered significant interest for
practical applications, particularly in energy harvesting and heat flux
sensing. For these applications, it is crucial for the module to operate
without an external magnetic field, necessitating a combination of a large ANE
and a substantial coercive force. However, most materials exhibiting a large
ANE typically have a relatively small coercive force. In our research, we have
explored the ANE in amorphous ferrimagnetic TbCo alloy films, noting that the
coercive force peaks at the magnetization compensation point (MCP). We observed
that transverse Seebeck coefficients are amplified with Tb doping, reaching
more than 1.0 uV/K over a wide composition range near the MCP, which is three
times greater than that of pure Co. Our findings indicate that this enhancement
is primarily due to direct conversion, a product of the transverse
thermoelectric component and electrical resistivity. TbCo films present several
significant advantages for practical use: a large ANE, the capability to
exhibit both positive and negative ANE, the flexibility to be deposited on any
substrate due to their amorphous nature, a low thermal conductivity, and a
large coercive force. These attributes make TbCo films a promising material for
advancing ANE-based technologies.

<h3>Beyond the Tamura model of the phonon-isotope scattering</h3>

<br>
<i>Nakib H. Protik, Claudia Draxl</i>
<p>The Tamura model is a particular type of 1$^{\text{st}}$ Born approximation
of the phonon-isotope scattering problem. The expression for the mode-resolved
phonon-isotope scattering rates in this model, derived in 1983, is still widely
used in ab initio transport calculations. While the original work emphasized
its applicability to low-energy acoustic phonons only, it has, nevertheless,
been also applied to optical phonons in the field of phonon transport. The
model has the salient feature of being a perturbation theory on top of a
virtual crystal background. As such, this approach does not correspond to the
proper methodology for solving the phonon-substitution defect problem in the
respective limit. Here, we explore three avenues to go beyond the Tamura model
and carry out calculations on a set of common materials to compare the
different approaches. This work allows a systematic improvement of the
treatment of phonon-isotope scattering in ab initio phonon transport, while
unifying it with the general phonon-substitution scattering problem.

<h3>Free energy of a two-liquid system of charge carriers in strongly  coupled electron and phonon fields and common nature of three phases in  hole-doped cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04479" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04479</a>
<br>
<i>A.E. Myasnikova, S. V. Doronkina, R. R. Arutyunyan, A. H. Dzhantemirov</i>
<p>Hole-doped cuprates demonstrate partially coexisting pseudogap, charge
density wave (CDW) and superconducting phases. Recently their common nature was
supposed due to similar doping dependence of their critical temperatures. In
the CDW phase, a large frozen deformation of strongly ionic lattice is
observed. Like for a single carrier in a highly polarizable lattice, for
multiple carriers in it the choice between delocalized states of all the
carriers and autolocalized states of some part of them is determined by minimum
of free energy of interacting carrier and phonon fields. Applying variational
approach, we calculate free energy of a two-liquid system of carriers with
cuprates-like dispersion comprising liquid of autolocalized carriers (large
polarons and bipolarons) and Fermi liquid of delocalized carriers. Comparing it
with the free energy of pure Fermi liquid and calculating (with standard
methods of Bose-liquid theory) a temperature of superfluid transition in the
large-bipolaron liquid we identify areas with presence of pseudogap (caused by
impact of (bi)polaron potential on delocalized quasiparticles), CDW and
superconductivity in a phase diagram. They are in the same places as in
hole-doped cuprates, and similarly to cuprates the shape of the calculated
phase diagram is stable with respect to wide-range change of the system
characteristics. Like in cuprates, the calculated temperature of the
superconducting transition increases with the number of conducting planes in
the unit cell, the calculated superfluid density decreases with doping at
overdoping, and the bipolaron density (together with bipolaronic plasmon
energy) saturates at optimal doping. The results obtained allow us to discuss
ways of increasing the temperature of the superfluid transition in
large-bipolaron liquid and open a possibility of studying the current-carrying
state and properties of bipolaron condensate.

<h3>Electrodynamics of superconductors: from Lorentz to Galilei at zero  temperature</h3>

<br>
<i>Luca Salasnich</i>
<p>We discuss the derivation of the electrodynamics of superconductors coupled
to the electromagnetic field from a Lorentz-invariant bosonic model of Cooper
pairs. Our results are obtained at zero temperature where, according to the
third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the system is zero. In the
nonrelativistic limit we obtain a Galilei-invariant superconducting system
which differs with respect to the familiar Schr\"odinger-like one. From this
point of view, there are similarities with the Pauli equation of fermions which
is derived from the Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit and has a
spin-magnetic field term in contrast with the Schr\"odinger equation. One of
the peculiar effects of our model is the decay of a static electric field
inside a superconductor exactly with the London penetration length. In
addition, our theory predicts a modified D'Alembert equation for the massive
electromagnetic field also in the case of nonrelativistic superconducting
matter. We emphasize the role of the Nambu-Goldstone phase field which is
crucial to obtain the collective modes of the superconducting matter field. In
the special case of a nonrelativistic neutral superfluid we find a gapless
Bogoliubov-like spectrum, while for the charged superfluid we obtain a
dispersion relation that is gapped by the plasma frequency.

<h3>Electric field-induced nonreciprocal spin current due to chiral phonons  in chiral-structure superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Dapeng Yao, Mamoru Matsuo, Takehito Yokoyama</i>
<p>The recent experiment [R. Nakajima, et al., Nature 613, 479 (2023)] has
reported a pair of oppositely polarized spins under an alternating electric
current in a superconductor with a chiral structure. However, these behaviors
cannot be explained by the conventional Edelstein effect and require a new
mechanism. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of spin current generation
under an external electric field due to chiral phonons in a chiral-structure
superconductor based on the Bogoliubov de Gennes and the Boltzmann equations.
In our mechanism, chiral phonons are induced by electric field due to inversion
symmetry breaking and electron-phonon interaction. They work as an effective
Zeeman field and hence spin-polarize Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the
superconductor. As a result, the spin current carried by quasiparticles flows
along the screw axis and shows a quadratic dependence on the electric field at
the low-field range, leading to a nonreciprocal spin transport. The spin
current also shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence and has a maximum at
around the superconducting transition temperature.

<p>Higher-order topological insulators and semimetals, which generalize the
conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, have attracted extensive research
interest. Among them, higher-order Weyl semimetals feature two-fold linear
crossing points in three-dimensional (3D) momentum space, 2D Fermi-arc surface
states, and 1D hinge states. Higher-order nodal-point semimetals possessing
Weyl points or Dirac points have been implemented. However, higher-order
nodal-line or nodal-surface semimetals remain to be further explored in
experiments in spite of many previous theoretical efforts. In this work, we
realize a second-order nodal-line semimetal in 3D phononic crystals. The bulk
nodal lines, 2D drumhead surface states guaranteed by Zak phases, and 1D flat
hinge states attributed to kz-dependent quadrupole moments, are observed in
simulations and experiments. Our findings of nondispersive surface and hinge
states may promote applications in acoustic sensing and energy harvesting.

<h3>Gate-tunable crossover between vortex-interaction and pinning dominated  regimes in Josephson-coupled Lead-islands on graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Suraina Gupta, Santu Prasad Jana, Rukshana Pervin, Anjan K. Gupta</i>
<p>Resistance of a Josephson junction array consisting of randomly distributed
lead (Pb) islands on exfoliated single layer graphene shows a broad
superconducting transition to zero with an onset temperature close to the
transition temperature of bulk Pb. The transition evolves with the back-gate
voltage and exhibits two peaks in temperature derivative of resistance. The
region above the lower temperature peak is found to be well described by
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless model of thermal unbinding of vortex
anti-vortex pairs while that below this peak fits well with the Ambegaokar-
Halperin model of thermally-activated phase slip or vortex motion in Josephson
junction arrays. Thus a gate-tunable crossover between interaction and pinning
dominated vortices is inferred as the Josephson energy, dictating the pinning
potential magnitude, increases with cooling while the effective screening
length, dictating the range of inter-vortex interaction, reduces.

<p>Light-induced ion demixing in mixed-halide perovskites is simulated
numerically using the phenomenological Cahn-Hilliard equation. In the model we
consider the energy of local elastic deformation as well as the contribution of
free carriers, assuming both the polaron and the bandgap-fluctuation models.
The simulation shows that elastic deformation suppresses the demixing while
free carriers promote it, however both effects lead to different ion
distributions. The free-carrier-induced demixing appears only for larger
starting random fluctuations of the ion concentration.

<i>Fabian Eickhoff, Frithjof B. Anders</i>
<p>In this paper we consider a multi band extension to the periodic Anderson
model. We use a single site DMFT(NRG) in order to study the impact of the
conduction band mediated effective hopping of the correlated electrons between
the correlated orbitals onto the heavy Fermi liquid formation. Whereas the
hybridization of a single impurity model with two distinct conduction bands
always adds up constructively, $T_{K}\propto \exp(-\alpha
U/(\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2))$, we show that this does not have to be the case in
lattice models, where, in remarkable contrast, also an emerging low-energy
Fermi liquid scale $T_0\propto \exp(-\alpha U/(\Gamma_1-\Gamma_2))$ is possible
due to quantum interference effects in multi band models. At high symmetry
points, heavy Fermi liquid formation is suppressed which is associated with a
breakdown of the Kondo effect. This results in an asymptotically
scale-invariant (i.e., power-law) spectrum of the correlated orbitals
$\propto|\omega|^{1/3}$ and a small Fermi surface including only the light
quasi-particles. This orbital selective Mott phase demonstrates the possibility
of metallic local criticality within the general framework of ordinary single
site DMFT.

<p>Symmetry engineering is explicitly effective to manipulate and even create
phases and orderings in strongly correlated materials. Flexural stress is
universally practical to break the space-inversion or time-reversal symmetry.
Here, by introducing strain gradient in a centrosymmetric antiferromagnet
Sr2IrO4, the space-inversion symmetry is broken accompanying a non-equivalent O
p-Ir d orbital hybridization along z axis. Thus, emergent polar phase and
out-of-plane magnetic moment have been simultaneously observed in these
asymmetric Sr2IrO4 thin films, which both are absent in its ground state.
Furthermore, upon the application of magnetic field, such polarization can be
controlled by modifying the occupied d orbitals through spin-orbit interaction,
giving rise to a flexomagnetoelectric effect. This work provides a general
strategy to artificially design multiple symmetries and ferroic orderings in
strongly correlated systems.

<h3>Multi-condensate lengths with degenerate excitation gaps in  BaNi$_2$As$_2$ revealed by muon spin relaxation study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04546</a>
<br>
<i>Kaiwen Chen, Zihao Zhu, Yaofeng Xie, Adrian D. Hillier, James S. Lord, Pengcheng Dai, Lei Shu</i>
<p>The recently discovered (Ba,Sr)Ni$_2$As$_2$ family provides an ideal platform
for investigating the interaction between electronic nematicity and
superconductivity. Here we report the muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR)
measurements on BaNi$_2$As$_2$. Transverse-field $\mu$SR experiments indicate
that the temperature dependence of superfluid density is best fitted with a
single-band $s$-wave model. On the other hand, the magnetic penetration depth
$\lambda$ shows magnetic field dependence, which contradicts with the
single-band fully-gapped scenario. Zero-field $\mu$SR experiments indicate the
absence of spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state, showing the
preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. Our
$\mu$SR experiments suggest that BaNi$_2$As$_2$ is a fully-gapped multiband
superconductor. The superconducting gap amplitudes of each band are nearly the
same while different bands exhibit different coherence lengths. The present
work helps to elucidate the controversial superconducting property of this
parent compound, paving the way for further research on doping the system with
Sr to enhance superconductivity.

<h3>Information bath and learning processes along geodesics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04559" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04559</a>
<br>
<i>Arnab Barua, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Sumiyoshi Abe</i>
<p>Learning is a fundamental characteristic of living systems, enabling them to
comprehend their environments and make informed decisions. These
decision-making processes are inherently influenced by available information
about their surroundings and specific objectives. An intriguing perspective is
that each process could be optimal under a given set of conditions. Here, a
geometric method is introduced for analytically exploring such a perspective.
The probability distribution describing the state of the composite system of
the environment, termed the information bath, and a decision-maker is discussed
on the basis of the entropic concept. This enables one to study the system in
analogy with thermodynamics. Learning processes are expressed as the changes of
parameters contained in the distribution. For a geometric interpretation of the
processes, the manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao metric as the Riemannian
metric is considered. This framework allows one to conceptualize the optimality
of each process as a state change along a geodesic curve on the manifold, which
is referred to here as geodesic learning. Then, the bivariate Gaussian model is
presented for illustrating this approach, and its rigorous solution is
obtained. There, the correspondence between learning and cooling is made
manifest. Evolution of the entropy is evaluated for geodesic learning. The
findings are then interpreted in the context of adaptation. Geodesic learning
plays a role of the case of reference and may give novel insights into the
mechanics of learning in living systems.

<h3>Modelling the elliptical instability of magnetic skyrmions</h3>

<p>Two recently developed methods of modelling chiral magnetic soliton
elliptical instability are applied in two novel scenarios, the tilted
ferromagnetic phase of chiral magnets dominated by easy-plane anisotropy and
the general case of the chiral magnet with tilted applied field and arbitrary
uniaxial anisotropy. In the former case, the analytical predictions are found
to exactly match previous numerical results. In the latter case, instability of
isolated chiral skyrmions has not yet been studied, although the predictions
correspond interestingly to previous numerical investigation of the phase
diagram.

<h3>Topological transverse spin transport in a canted antiferromagnet/heavy  metal heterostructure</h3>

<br>
<i>Wesley Roberts, Bowen Ma, Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Gregory A. Fiete</i>
<p>We theoretically study the conditions under which a spin Nernst effect - a
transverse spin current induced by an applied temperature gradient - can occur
in a canted antiferromagnetic insulator, such as ${\rm LaFeO_3}$ and other
materials of the same family. The spin Nernst effect may provide a microscopic
mechanism for an experimentally observed anomalous thermovoltage in ${\rm
LaFeO_3}$/Pt heterostructures, where spin is transferred across the
insulator/metal interface when a temperature gradient is applied to ${\rm
LaFeO_3}$ parallel to the interface [W. Lin ${\it et \; al}$, Nat. Phys. ${\bf
18}$, 800 (2022)]. We find that ${\rm LaFeO_3}$ exhibits a topological spin
Nernst effect when inversion symmetry is broken on the axes parallel to both
the applied temperature gradient and the direction of spin transport, which can
result in a spin injection across the insulator/metal interface. Our work
provides a general derivation of a symmetry-breaking-induced spin Nernst
effect, which may open a path to engineering a finite spin Nernst effect in
systems where it would otherwise not arise.

<h3>Revealing dark exciton signatures in polariton spectra of 2D materials</h3>

<p>Dark excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have been so far
neglected in the context of polariton physics due to their lack of oscillator
strength. However, in tungsten-based TMDs, dark excitons are known to be the
energetically lowest states and could thus provide important scattering
partners for polaritons. In this joint theory-experiment work, we investigate
the impact of the full exciton energy landscape on polariton absorption and
reflectance. By changing the cavity detuning, we vary the polariton energy
relative to the unaffected dark excitons in such a way that we open or close
specific phonon-driven scattering channels. We demonstrate both in theory and
experiment that this controlled switching of scattering channels manifests in
characteristic sharp changes in optical spectra of polaritons. These spectral
features can be exploited to extract the position of dark excitons. Our work
suggests new possibilities for exploiting polaritons for fingerprinting
nanomaterials via their unique exciton landscape.

<h3>Variational Monte-Carlo Approach for Hubbard Model Applied to Twisted  Bilayer WSe$_2$ at Half-Filling</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrzej Biborski, Paweł Wójcik, Michał Zegrodnik</i>
<p>We consider an effective Hubbard model with spin- and direction-dependent
complex hoppings $t$, applied to twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ using a
variational Monte Carlo approach. The electronic correlations are taken into
account by applying the Gutzwiller on-site correlator as well as long-range
Jastrow correlators subjected to noninteracting part being of Pfaffian form.
Our analysis shows the emergence of Mott insulating state at critical value of
Hubbard interaction $U_{c1}\approx 6.5|t|\div7|t|$ estimated by extrapolating
the density-density equal-time two-particle Green's functions. The signatures
of an intermediate insulating phase between $U_{c1}$ and
$U_{c2}\approx9.5|t|\div10|t|$ are also discussed. Furthermore, we report the
formation of the $120^{\circ}$ in-plane N\'eel state indicated by the detailed
analysis of the spin-spin correlation functions. As shown, switching between
antiferromagnetic phases characterized by opposite chirality could be
experimentally realized by the change of perpendicular electric field. In
proper range of electric fields also a transition to in-plane ferromagnetic
state appears.

<h3>Polymer translocation: Effects of confinement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04610" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04610</a>
<br>
<i>Manish Dwivedi, Sumitra Rudra, Sanjay Kumar</i>
<p>We investigate the influence of varying confinement on the dynamics of
polymer translocation through a cone shaped channel. For this, a linear polymer
chain is modeled by a self voiding walks (SAWs) on a square lattice. The
cis-side of a cone-shaped channel has a finite volume, whereas the trans-side
has a semi-infinite space. The confining environment is varied either by
changing the position of the back wall while keeping the apex angle fixed or
altering the apex angle while keeping the position of the back wall fixed. In
both cases, the effective space {\phi}, which represents the number of monomers
in a chain relative to the total number of accessible sites within the cone, is
reduced due to the imposed confinement. Consequently, the translocation
dynamics are affected. We analyze the entropy of the confined system as a
function {\phi}, which exhibits non-monotonic behaviour. We also calculate the
free energy associated with the confinement as a function of a virtual
coordinate for different positions of the back wall (base of the cone) along
the conical axis for various apex angles.Employing the Fokker-Planck equation,
we calculate the translocation time as a function of {\phi} for different
solvent conditions across the pore. Our findings indicate that the
translocation time decreases as {\phi} increases, but it eventually reaches a
saturation point at a certain value of {\phi}. Moreover, we highlight the
possibility to control the translocation dynamics by manipulating the solvent
quality across the pore. Furthermore, our investigation delves into the
intricacies of polymer translocation through a cone-shaped channel, considering
both repulsive and neutral interactions with the pore wall. This exploration
unveils nuanced dynamics and sheds light on the factors that significantly
impact translocation within confined channels.

<p>Hybrid multiferroic films are fabricated by depositing of Pt/Co/Pt
multilayers onto [001] and [110] cuts of PMN-PT crystal. The dependence of the
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) on applied electric field
is experimentally investigated in the system by the Brilloin light scattering
method. A strong variation (from -0.2 to 0.8 mJ/m2) of the iDMI constant is
observed when the electric field is applied. In the case of [001] cut, the
observed changes in the iDMI have an isotropic character, while in the case of
[110] cut they are anisotropic, which corresponds to the symmetry of the PMN-PT
deformations. The change in the iDMI is accompanied by the formation of various
unusual domain structures and skyrmion lattices. External control of the DMI
with an electric field opens the way to manipulate topological magnetic
solitons (such as skyrmions), which are promising objects for information
processing and storage.

<h3>Signatures of novel magnon-phonon coupling in frustrated double  perovskite square lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Shalini Badola, Aprajita Joshi, Akriti Singh, Surajit Saha</i>
<p>Low-dimensional frustrated magnetic square networks feature a variety of
unconventional phases with novel emergent excitations. Often these excitations
are intertwined and manifest into intriguing phenomena, an area that has
remained largely unexplored in square-lattice systems, especially, double
perovskites (A2BB'O6). In this study, we explore these interactions between the
fundamental excitations such as phonons and magnons in square-lattice
Sr2CuTeO6, Sr2CuWO6, and Ba2CuWO6 isostructural double perovskites that exhibit
both short-ranged (TS) as well as long-ranged Neel antiferromagnetic (TN)
transitions. Our Raman measurements at variable temperatures reveal an
intriguing broad peak (identified as 2-magnon (2M)) surviving beyond TS for
W-based compositions contrary to the Te-based system, suggesting a key role of
diamagnetic B'-site cation on their magnetism. The thermal response of 2M
intriguingly shows signatures of correlation with phonons and control over
their anharmonicity, depicting magnon-phonon interaction. Further, a few
phonons exhibit anomalies across the magnetic transitions implying the presence
of spin-phonon coupling. In particular, the phonon modes at ~ 194 cm-1 of
Sr2CuTeO6 and ~ 168 cm-1 of Sr2CuWO6, that show a strong correlation with the
2M, exhibit the strongest spin-phonon coupling suggesting their roles in
mediating magnon-phonon interactions in these systems.

<h3>Assembling dipolar quantum solids with semiconductor excitons</h3>

<br>
<i>Camille Lagoin, Kirk Baldwin, Loren Pfeiffer, Francois Dubin</i>
<p>Condensed-mater systems offer a fascinating realm when spatially extended
interactions have strengths exceeding thermal and kinetic energies. Many-body
ground-states are then governed by spatial order so that quantum crystals
emerge spontaneously. Here we report such quantum crystal for bosons, by
assembling dipolar quantum solids made by two-dimensional excitons of GaAs
bilayers. We trigger quantum crystallisation by preparing a Mott insulator with
one exciton in every site of a shallow artificial lattice. In turn, the Mott
phase self-defines a dipolar anti-lattice where additional excitons are
confined and spontaneously realise a checkerboard solid at half-filling. We
evidence that strong dipolar correlations effectively bound excitonic Mott and
checkerboard phases, while screening the artificial lattice confinement. Our
observations thus show that lattice models with extended interactions provide a
fertile ground to emulate Wigner crystallisation.

<h3>Binding potential and wetting behaviour of binary liquid mixtures on  surfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Mounirah Areshi, Dmitri Tseluiko, Uwe Thiele, Benjamin D. Goddard, Andrew J. Archer</i>
<p>We present a theory for the interfacial wetting phase behaviour of binary
liquid mixtures on rigid solid substrates, applicable to both miscible and
immiscible mixtures. In particular, we calculate the binding potential as a
function of the adsorptions, i.e. the excess amounts of each of the two liquids
at the substrate. The binding potential fully describes the corresponding
interfacial thermodynamics. Our approach is based on classical density
functional theory. Binary liquid mixtures can exhibit complex bulk phase
behaviour, including both liquid-liquid and vapour-liquid phase separation,
depending on the nature of the interactions between all the particles of the
two different liquids, the temperature and the chemical potentials. Here we
show that the interplay between the bulk phase behaviour of the mixture and the
properties of the interactions with the substrate gives rise to a wide variety
of interfacial phase behaviours, including mixing and demixing situations. We
find situations where the final state is a coexistence of up to three different
phases. We determine how the liquid density profiles close to the substrate
change as the interaction parameters are varied and how these determine the
form of the binding potential, which in certain cases can be a multi-valued
function of the adsorptions. We also present profiles for sessile droplets of
both miscible and immiscible binary liquids.

<p>Thin films of the pyrochlore iridates along the [111] direction have drawn
significant attention to investigate exotic correlated topological phenomena.
Here, we report the fabrication of Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ thin films via reactive
solid phase epitaxy using the pulsed laser deposition technique. We mainly
focus on the transport properties of the films below the magnetic phase
transition at 105 K. Analyses on the temperature and the field dependences of
resistivity unveil the presence of weak antilocalization, a characteristic
signature of the Weyl semimetallic state that has been "buried" by magnetism.
Moreover, it is noteworthy that the contribution from many-body interactions in
Eu2Ir2O7 thin films is enhanced at lower temperatures and competes with the
weak antilocalization effect, and eventually drives the crossover to weak
localization at 2 K.

<h3>Stalled response near thermal equilibrium in periodically driven systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Lennart Dabelow, Peter Reimann</i>
<p>The question of how systems respond to perturbations is ubiquitous in
physics. Predicting this response for large classes of systems becomes
particularly challenging if many degrees of freedom are involved and linear
response theory cannot be applied. Here, we consider isolated many-body quantum
systems which either start out far from equilibrium and then thermalize, or
find themselves near thermal equilibrium from the outset. We show that
time-periodic perturbations of moderate strength, in the sense that they do not
heat up the system too quickly, give rise to the following phenomenon of
stalled response: While the driving usually causes quite considerable reactions
as long as the unperturbed system is far from equilibrium, the driving effects
are strongly suppressed when the unperturbed system approaches thermal
equilibrium. Likewise, for systems prepared near thermal equilibrium, the
response to the driving is barely noticeable right from the beginning.
Numerical results are complemented by a quantitatively accurate analytical
description and by simple qualitative arguments.

<p>Engineering of ferroelectric domain structures enables direct control over
the switching dynamics and is crucial for tuning the functional properties of
ferroelectrics for various applications, ranging from capacitors to future
nanoelectronics. Here, we investigate domain formation in poly- and single
crystalline improper ferroelectric DyMnO3. We show that a non-uniform
grain-size distribution in the polycrystals facilitates the coexistence of
multi-scale domains, varying by up to one order of magnitude in size. This
unusual domain structure originates from an inverted domain-size/grain-size
dependence that is intrinsic to the hexagonal manganite polycrystals, expanding
previous studies towards non-uniform grain-size distributions. Our results
demonstrate that the micrometer-sized grains in DyMnO3 represent individual
ferroelectric units with a characteristic domain structure, giving a new
dimension to domain engineering in ferroelectric polycrystals with non-uniform
microstructures.

<h3>Protected Weyl semimetals within 2D chiral classes</h3>

<br>
<i>Faruk Abdulla</i>
<p>Weyl semimetals in three dimensions can exist independently of any symmetry
apart from translations. Conversely, in two dimensions, Weyl semimetals are
believed to require additional symmetries including crystalline symmetries to
exist. In this study, we demonstrate that a 2D Weyl semimetal phase can exist
in systems with Hamiltonians possessing internal symmetries, such as time
reversal ${\cal T}$, charge conjugation ${\cal C}$ , and their combined chiral
symmetry ${\cal S} = {\cal CT}$, only. Starting from a minimal-dimension Dirac
Hamiltonian, we establish the presence of a stable Weyl semimetal phase in each
of the five chiral classes: AIII, BDI, CII, DIII, and CI in two dimension.
Similar to 3D Weyl semimetals where Weyl points possess nontrivial topological
charges (Chern number), the Weyl points in WSMs within the 2D chiral classes
are characterized by the $Z$ winding numbers. In accordance with the
bulk-boundary correspondence, protected Fermi arc edge states emerge,
connecting the projections of Weyl points that carry opposite topological
charges. Unlike the surface states in 3D WSMs, the edge states of WSMs within
2D chiral classes are completely dispersionless and are always at the zero
energy due to the protecting chiral symmetry.

<i>Tsung-Han Yang, Tieyan Chang, Yu-Sheng Chen, K. W. Plumb</i>
<p>The lacunar spinel GaNb$_4$Se$_8$ is a tetrahedral cluster Mott insulator
where spin-orbit coupling on molecular orbitals and Jahn-Teller energy scales
are competitive. GaNb$_4$Se$_8$ undergoes a structural and anti-polar ordering
transition at T$_Q$ = 50 K that corresponds to a quadrupolar ordering of
molecular orbitals on Nb$_4$ clusters. A second transition occurs at T$_M$ = 29
K, where local distortions on the Nb$_4$ clusters rearrange. We present a
single crystal x-ray diffraction investigation these phase transitions and
solve the crystal structure in the intermediate T$_M$ < T < T$_Q$ and low T <
T$_M$ temperature phases. The intermediate phase is a primitive cubic P2$_1$3
structure with a staggered arrangement of Nb4 cluster distortions. A symmetry
mode analysis reveals that the transition at TQ is continuous and described by
a single Jahn-Teller active amplitude mode. In the low temperature phase, the
symmetry of Nb$_4$ clusters is further reduced and the unit cell doubles into
an orthorhombic P2$_1$2$_1$2$_1$ space group. Nb$_4$ clusters rearrange through
this transition to form a staggered arrangement of intercluster dimers,
suggesting a valence bond solid magnetic state.

<p>Based on the earlier published theory (Nature Mat. 18, 223-228 (2019)), a
comprehensive experimental investigation of multiferroic quantum critical
behavior of (Eu,Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ polycrystalline and single crystal samples was
performed. Presence of the displacive ferroelectric quantum criticality is
revealed through non-classical ($T^2$) temperature scaling of inverse
dielectric susceptibility up to 60 K. With increasing hydrostatic pressure,
this ferroelectric quantum criticality is gradually suppressed. Inverse
magnetic susceptibility follows classical Curie-Weiss law down to 4 K, but
quantum fluctuations belonging to an antiferromagnetic phase transition
($T_{\mathrm{N}}$ < 0.8 K) change its scaling below 4 K to $T^{1.7}$ and
$T^{2.0}$ for samples containing 29 % and 25 % of Eu$^{2+}$ ions, respectively.
Observation of the coexisting ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic, i.e.
multiferroic, quantum fluctuations and qualitative explanation why they are
seen only in the immediate proximity of $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ is given.

<i>M. Kempa, V. Bovtun, D. Repček, J. Buršík, C. Kadlec, S. Kamba</i>
<p>Microwave (MW) spectra of ferrimagnetic U-hexaferrite
Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$ ceramics were studied using several experimental
techniques from 100 MHz to 50 GHz at temperatures between 10 and 390 K. They
revealed 9 excitations, which exhibit remarkable temperature dependences near
the magnetic phase transitions at 145 K and 305 K. Some of them also change
under the application of a weak bias magnetic field at room temperature. Three
lowest-frequency modes seen between 200 MHz and 3 GHz were assigned to the
dynamics of the magnetic domains. The mode attributed to the natural
ferromagnetic resonance exhibits a dramatic critical slowing-down from 25 GHz
at 390 K to 5 GHz near the 305 K phase transition, and again a hardening to ~11
GHz on further cooling. The higher-frequency excitations are most likely spin
wave (magnon) modes arising from the complex ferrimagnetic structure of
Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$. The high sensitivity of the MW spectra to the weak
magnetic bias field $H$ < 700 Oe at room temperature is shown to be caused by
the transformation of the polydomain magnetic structure in randomly oriented
ceramic grains to a monodomain one. The MW response measured above 2 GHz using
coplanar and microstrip lines with different electromagnetic field distribution
and sample coupling revealed the same excitations with similar temperature and
bias field dependences. It confirms the reliability of the results and proves
the effectiveness of the used MW techniques.

<p>We theoretically investigate a voltage-biased normal
metal-superconductor-normal metal (N-S-N) junction. Using the nonequilibrium
Green's function technique, we derive a quantum kinetic equation, to determine
the superconducting order parameter self-consistently. The derived equation is
an integral-differential equation with memory effects. We solve this equation
by converting it into a system of ordinary differential equations with the use
of a pole expansion of the Fermi-Dirac function. When the applied voltage
exceeds the critical value, the superconductor switches to the normal state. We
find that when the voltage is decreased from the normal phase, the system
relaxes to a Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type inhomogeneous superconducting state,
even in the absence of a magnetic Zeeman field. We point out that the emergence
of the LO-type state can be attributed to the nonequilibrium energy
distribution of electrons due to the bias voltage. We also point out that the
system exhibits bistability, which leads to hysteresis in the voltage-current
characteristic of the N-S-N junction.

<p>Understanding how the electronic excitation of DNA changes in response to
different high-energy particles is central to advancing ion beam cancer
therapy. While protons have been the predominant ion of choice in beam cancer
therapy, heavier ions, particularly carbon ions, have drawn significant
attention over the past decade. Carbon ions are expected to transfer larger
amounts of energy accordingly to the linear response theory. However, the
molecular-level details of the electronic excitation under heavier ion
irradiation remain unknown. In this work, we use real-time time-dependent
density functional theory simulations to examine the quantum-mechanical details
of DNA electronic excitations in water under proton, alpha-particle, and carbon
ion irradiation. Our results show that the energy transfer does indeed increase
for the heavier ions, while the excitation remains highly conformal. However,
the increase in the energy transfer rate, measured by electronic stopping
power, does not match the prediction by the linear response model, even when
accounting for the velocity-dependence of the irradiating ions charge. The
simulations also reveal that while the number of holes generated on DNA
increases for heavier ions, the increase is only partially responsible for the
larger stopping power. Larger numbers of highly energetic holes formed from the
heavier ions also contribute significantly to the increased electronic stopping
power.

<p>Kagome lattices have garnered substantial interest because their band
structure consists of topological flat bands and Dirac cones. The RMn$_6$Sn$_6$
(R = rare earth) compounds are particularly interesting because of the
existence of large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) which originates from
the gapped Dirac cones near the Fermi level. This makes RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ an
outstanding candidate for realizing the high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall
effect. The growth of RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ thin films is beneficial for both
fundamental research and potential applications. However, most of the studies
on RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ have focused on bulk crystals so far, and the synthesis of
RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ thin films has not been reported so far. Here we report the
atomic layer molecular beam epitaxy growth, structural and magnetic
characterizations, and transport properties of ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and
TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ thin films. It is especially noteworthy that TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ thin
films have out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, which is important for realizing
the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Our work paves the avenue toward the control
of the AHE using devices patterned from RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ thin films.

<h3>An Effective Theory for Graphene Nanoribbons with Junctions</h3>

<p>Graphene nanoribbons are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum
electronics. In this scenario, qubits are realised by localised states that can
emerge on junctions in hybrid ribbons formed by two armchair nanoribbons of
different widths. We derive an effective theory based on a tight-binding ansatz
for the description of hybrid nanoribbons and use it to make accurate
predictions of the energy gap and nature of the localisation in various hybrid
nanoribbon geometries. We discover, in addition to the well known localisations
on junctions, which we call `Fuji', a new type of `Kilimanjaro' localisation
smeared out over a segment of the hybrid ribbon. We show that Fuji
localisations in hybrids of width $N$ and $N+2$ armchair nanoribbons occur
around symmetric junctions if and only if $N\pmod3=1$, while edge-aligned
junctions never support strong localisation. This behaviour cannot be explained
relying purely on the topological $Z_2$ invariant, which has been believed the
origin of the localisations to date.

<p>In this work, we study inelastic electron scattering in polar materials
(SrTiO3, PbTiO3, and SiC) using high-resolution transmission electron
energy-loss spectroscopy, challenging the assumption that phonon polaritons
from dipole scattering are excluded at large angles. We demonstrate that
through multiple scattering, the electron beam can excite both phonons and
phonon polaritons, and the relative proportion of each varies depending on the
structure factor and scattering angle. Integrating dielectric theory, density
functional theory, and multi-slice simulations, we provide a comprehensive
framework for understanding these interactions in polar materials.
