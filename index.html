<h3>Unconventional superfluidity and quantum geometry of topological bosons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08748" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08748</a>
<br>
<i>Ilya Lukin, Andrii Sotnikov, Alexander Kruchkov</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate superfluidity of bosons in gapped topological bands and
discover a new phase that has no counterparts in the previous literature. This
phase is characterized by a highly unconventional modulation of the order
parameter, breaking the crystallographic symmetry, and for which the
condensation momentum is neither zero nor any other high-symmetry vector of the
Brillouin zone. This unconventional structure impacts the spectrum of
Bogoliubov excitations and, consequently, the speed of sound in the system.
Even in the case of perfectly flat bands, the speed of sound and Bogoliubov
excitations remain nonvanishing, provided that the underlying topology and
quantum geometry are nontrivial. Furthermore, we derive detailed expressions
for the superfluid weight using the Popov hydrodynamic formalism for
superfluidity and provide estimates for the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
temperature, which is significantly enhanced by the nontriviality of the
underlying quantum metric. These results are applicable to generic topological
bosonic bands, with or without dispersion. To illustrate our findings, we
employ the Haldane model with a tunable bandwidth, including the narrow
lowest-band case. Within this model, we also observe a re-entrant superfluid
behavior: As the Haldane's magnetic flux is varied, the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature initially decreases to
almost zero, only to resurface with renewed vigor.

Hydrodynamics is an efficient theory for describing the large-scale dynamics
of many-body systems. The equations of hydrodynamics at the Euler scale are
often obtained phenomenologically under the assumption of local entropy
maximisation. With integrability, this has led to the theory of generalised
hydrodynamics (GHD), based on local generalised Gibbs ensembles. But deriving
such equations from the microscopic dynamics itself remains one of the most
important challenges of mathematical physics. This is especially true in
deterministic, interacting particle systems. We provide an ab initio derivation
of the GHD equations in the Lieb-Liniger quantum integrable model describing
cold atomic gases in one dimension. The derivation is valid at all interaction
strengths, and does not rely on the assumption of local entropy maximisation.
For this purpose, we show that a gas of wave packets, formed by
macroscopic-scale modulations of Bethe eigenfunctions, behave as a gas of
classical particles with a certain integrable dynamics, and that at large
scales, this classical dynamics gives rise to the GHD equations. This opens the
way for a much deeper mathematical and physical understanding of the
hydrodynamics of integrable models.

<h3>Twice Hidden String Order and Competing Phases in the Spin-1/2  Kitaev-Gamma Ladder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08731" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08731</a>
<br>
<i>Erik S. Sørensen, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<br>
<br>
While a complete understanding of the phase-diagram of Kitaev materials has
yet to be achieved, important insights can be gained from studying
low-dimensional models such as chains and ladders. Here we focus on the
Kitaev-Gamma ladder with both Kitaev ($K$) and Gamma ($\Gamma$) couplings. We
first report two new phases near $K$=0, $\Gamma\mathord{>}$0, termed
SPT$_\alpha$, and SPT$_\beta$, which are magnetically disordered and
characterize them as symmetry protected topological (SPT) states. We then
clarify the nature of the A$\Gamma$-phase surrounding the point $K$=0,
$\Gamma\mathord{=}1$ point, by revealing a non-zero string order parameter. The
string order is uncovered by first applying a local unitary transformation,
then a non-local, arriving at a model which shows ordinary long-range order. In
a sense, the order is therefore twice hidden. In addition to the long-range
string order, the existence of degenerate edge modes is another hallmark of a
SPT phase, of which there are four in the A$\Gamma$-phase. Remarkably, the
edge-states in the A$\Gamma$-phase only respond to a field applied along the
$\mathbf{\hat{b}}$-direction ([1-10]), contrary to the Kitaev phases in the
ladder. Furthermore, the topology of the A$\Gamma$-phase is robust under a
field applied in the $\mathbf{\hat{a}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{c}}$ directions, as
the degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum is intact. The A$\Gamma$-phase is
then protected by $TR\times \mathcal{R}_{b}$ symmetry, the product of
time-reversal ($TR$) and $\pi$ rotation around the $\mathbf{\hat b}$-axis
($\mathcal{R}_{b}$).

<h3>Shapiro steps in driven atomic Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08743</a>
<br>
<i>Vijay Pal Singh, Juan Polo, Ludwig Mathey, Luigi Amico</i>
<br>
<br>
We study driven atomic Josephson junctions realized by coupling two
two-dimensional atomic clouds with a tunneling barrier. By moving the barrier
at a constant velocity, dc and ac Josephson regimes are characterized by a zero
and nonzero atomic density difference across the junction, respectively. Here,
we monitor the dynamics resulting in the system when, in addition to the above
constant velocity protocol, the position of the barrier is periodically driven.
We demonstrate that the time-averaged particle imbalance features a step-like
behavior that is the analog of Shapiro steps observed in driven superconducting
Josephson junctions. The underlying dynamics reveals an intriguing interplay of
the vortex and phonon excitations, where Shapiro steps are induced via
suppression of vortex growth. We study the system with a classical-field
dynamics method, and benchmark our findings with a driven circuit dynamics.

<h3>Dynamical localization transition in the non-Hermitian $\mathbb{Z}_2$  gauge theory</h3>

<br>
Local constraint in lattice gauge theory provides an exotic mechanism
inducing disorder-free localization. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics in
the non-Hermition lattice gauge model has not been well understood. Here, we
investigate the quench dynamics of spinless fermions with nonreciprocal hopping
in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field formed from the bond spins. Based on the
effective model from duality mapping, the non-Hermitian skin effect,
disorder-free localization-delocalization transition, and the real-complex
transition of eigenenergies are explored systematically. By identifying the
diverse scaling behaviors of quantum mutual information for fermions and spins,
we predict that the non-Hermition quantum disentangled liquid presents both in
localized and delocalized phase with completely different physical nature, the
first comes from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field and the second originates from
the non-Hermitian skin effect. We finally show that the nonreciprocal
dissipation of fermions leads the quantum information flowing from the fermions
to spins. Our results provide new insights to the nonequilibrium dynamics in
the gauge field, and can be experimentally verified using ultracold atoms in
optical lattices.

<h3>Topological properties of a non-Hermitian quasi-one-dimensional chain  with a flat band</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08754</a>
<br>
<i>C.Martínez-Strasser, M.A.J.Herrera, G.Palumbo, F.K.Kunst, D.Bercioux</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the spectral properties of a non-Hermitian
quasi-one-dimensional lattice in two possible dimerization configurations.
Specifically, we focus on a non-Hermitian diamond chain that presents a
zero-energy flat band. The flat band originates from wave interference and
results in eigenstates with a finite contribution only on two sites of the unit
cell. To achieve the non-Hermitian characteristics, we introduce non-reciprocal
intrasite hopping terms in the chain. This leads to the accumulation of
eigenstates on the boundary of the system, known as the non-Hermitian skin
effect. Despite this accumulation of eigenstates, for one of the two possible
configurations, we can characterize the presence of non-trivial edge states at
zero energy by a real-space topological invariant known as the biorthogonal
polarization. We show that this invariant, evaluated using the destructive
interference method, characterizes the non-trivial phase of the non-Hermitian
diamond chain. For the other possible non-Hermitian configuration, we find that
there is a finite quantum metric associated with the flat band. Additionally,
we observe the skin effect despite having the system a purely real or imaginary
spectrum. For both configurations, we show that two non- Hermitian diamond
chains can be mapped into two models of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, either
non-Hermitian and Hermitian, in the presence of a flat band. This mapping
allows us to draw valuable insights into the behavior and properties of these
systems.

<h3>Exotic quantum liquids in Bose-Hubbard models with spatially-modulated  symmetries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08761" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08761</a>
<br>
<i>Pablo Sala, Yizhi You, Johannes Hauschild, Olexei Motrunich</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect that spatially modulated continuous conserved
quantities can have on quantum ground states. We do so by introducing a family
of one-dimensional local quantum rotor and bosonic models which conserve finite
Fourier momenta of the particle number, but not the particle number itself.
These correspond to generalizations of the standard Bose-Hubbard model (BHM),
and relate to the physics of Bose surfaces. First, we show that while having an
infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space, such systems feature a non-trivial
Hilbert space fragmentation for momenta incommensurate with the lattice. This
is linked to the nature of the conserved quantities having a dense spectrum and
provides the first such example. We then characterize the zero-temperature
phase diagram for both commensurate and incommensurate momenta. In both cases,
analytical and numerical calculations predict a phase transition between a
gapped (Mott insulating) and quasi-long range order phase; the latter is
characterized by a two-species Luttinger liquid in the infrared, but dressed by
oscillatory contributions when computing microscopic expectation values.
Following a rigorous Villain formulation of the corresponding rotor model, we
derive a dual description, from where we estimate the robustness of this phase
using renormalization group arguments, where the driving perturbation has
ultra-local correlations in space but power law correlations in time. We
support this conclusion using an equivalent representation of the system as a
two-dimensional vortex gas with modulated Coulomb interactions within a fixed
symmetry sector. We conjecture that a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type
transition is driven by the unbinding of vortices along the temporal direction.

<h3>Decoding chirality in circuit topology of a self entangled chain through  braiding</h3>

Circuit topology employs fundamental units of entanglement, known as soft
contacts, for constructing knots from the bottom up, utilising circuit topology
relations, namely parallel, series, cross, and concerted relations. In this
article, we further develop this approach to facilitate the analysis of
chirality, which is a significant quantity in polymer chemistry. To achieve
this, we translate the circuit topology approach to knot engineering into a
braid-theoretic framework. This enables us to calculate the Jones polynomial
for all possible binary combinations of contacts in cross or concerted
relations and to show that, for series and parallel relations, the polynomial
factorises. Our results demonstrate that the Jones polynomial provides a
powerful tool for analysing the chirality of molecular knots constructed using
circuit topology. The framework presented here can be used to design and
engineer a wide range of entangled chain with desired chiral properties, with
potential applications in fields such as materials science and nanotechnology.

<h3>Superfluid phase transition of nanoscale-confined helium-3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08808" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08808</a>
<br>
<i>Canon Sun, Adil Attar, Igor Boettcher</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the superfluid phase transition of helium-3
under nanoscale confinement of one spatial dimension realized in recent
experiments. Instead of the 3x3 complex matrix order parameter found in the
three-dimensional system, the quasi two-dimensional superfluid is described by
a reduced 3x2 complex matrix. It features a nodal quasiparticle spectrum,
regardless of the value of the order parameter. The origin of the 3x2 order
parameter is first illustrated via the two-particle Cooper problem, where
Cooper pairs in the $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals are shown to have a lower bound
state energy than those in $p_z$ orbitals, hinting at their energetically
favorable role at the phase transition. We then compute the Landau free energy
under confinement within the mean-field approximation and show that the
critical temperature for condensation of the 3x2 order parameter is larger than
for other competing phases. Through exact minimization of the mean-field free
energy, we show that mean-field theory predicts precisely two energetically
degenerate superfluid orders to emerge at the transition that are not related
by symmetry: the A-phase and the planar phase. Beyond the mean-field
approximation, we show that strong-coupling corrections favor the A-phase
observed in experiment, whereas weak-coupling perturbative renormalization
group predicts the planar phase to be stable.

<h3>A double rigidity transition rules the fate of drying colloidal drops</h3>

The evaporation of drops of colloidal suspensions plays an important role in
numerous contexts, such as the production of powdered dairies, the synthesis of
functional supraparticles, and virus and bacteria survival in aerosols or drops
on surfaces. The presence of colloidal particles in the evaporating drop
eventually leads to the formation of a dense shell that may undergo a shape
instability. Previous works propose that, for drops evaporating very fast, the
instability occurs when the particles form a rigid porous solid, constituted of
permanently aggregated particles at random close packing. To date, however, no
measurements could directly test this scenario and assess whether it also
applies to drops drying at lower evaporation rates, severely limiting our
understanding of this phenomenon and the possibility of harnessing it in
applications. Here, we combine macroscopic imaging and space- and time-resolved
measurements of the microscopic dynamics of colloidal nanoparticles in drying
drops, measuring the evolution of the thickness of the shell and the spatial
distribution and mobility of the nanoparticles. We find that, above a threshold
evaporation rate, the drop undergoes successively two distinct shape
instabilities. While the second instability is due to the permanent aggregation
of nanoparticles, as hypothesized in previous works on fast-evaporating drops,
we show that the first one results from a reversible glass transition of the
shell, unreported so far. We rationalize our findings and discuss their
implications in the framework of a unified state diagram for the drying of
colloidal drops.

<br>
<br>
The synthesis of thin films of magnetic topological materials is necessary to
achieve novel quantized Hall effects and electrodynamic responses. EuIn2As2 is
a recently predicted topological axion insulator that has an antiferromagnetic
ground state and an inverted band structure but that has only been synthesized
and studied as a single crystal. We report on the synthesis of c-axis oriented
EuIn2As2 films by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. By careful
tuning of the substrate temperature during growth, we stabilize the Zintl phase
of EuIn2As2 expected to be topologically non-trivial. The magnetic properties
of these films reproduce those seen in single crystals but their resistivity is
enhanced when grown at lower temperatures. We additionally find that the
magnetoresistance of EuIn2As2 is negative even up to fields as high as 31T but
while it is highly anisotropic at low fields, it becomes nearly isotropic at
high magnetic fields above 5T. Overall, the transport characteristics of
EuIn2As2 appear similar to those of chalcogenide topological insulators,
motivating the development of devices to gate tune the Fermi energy to reveal
topological features in quantum transport.

<h3>X-ray Spectroscopy of a Rare-Earth Molecular System Measured at the  Single Atom Limit in Room Temperature</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the limit of X-ray detection at room temperature on rare-earth
molecular films using lanthanum and a pyridine-based dicarboxamide organic
linker as a model system. Synchrotron X-ray scanning tunneling microscopy is
used to probe the molecules with different coverages on a HOPG substrate.
X-ray-induced photocurrent intensities are measured as a function of molecular
coverage on the sample allowing a correlation of the amount of La ions with the
photocurrent signal strength. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows cogent M4,5
absorption edges of the lanthanum ion originated by the transitions from the
3d3/2 and 3d5/2 to 4f orbitals. X-ray absorption spectra measured in the
tunneling regime further reveal an X-ray excited tunneling current produced at
the M4,5 absorption edge of La ion down to the ultimate atomic limit at room
temperature.

<h3>First-passage on disordered intervals</h3>

<br>
<i>James Holhouse, S. Redner</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the first-passage properties of nearest-neighbor hopping on a
finite interval with disordered hopping rates. We develop an approach that
relies on the backward equation, in conjunction with probability generating
functions, to obtain all moments, as well as the distribution of first-passage
times. Our approach is simpler than previous approaches that are based on
either the forward equation or recursive method, in which the $m^{\rm th}$
moment requires all preceding moments. For the interval with two absorbing
boundaries, we elucidate the disparity in the first-passage times between
different realizations of the hopping rates and also unexpectedly find that the
distribution of first-passage times can be \emph{bimodal} for certain
realizations of the hopping rates.

<h3>Elastic chiral Landau level and snake states in origami metamaterials</h3>

<br>
<i>Shuaifeng Li, Panayotis G.Kevrekidis, Jinkyu Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, we present a method for generating a synthetic gauge field in
origami metamaterials with continuously varying geometrical parameters. By
modulating the mass term in the Dirac equation linearly, we create a synthetic
gauge field in the vertical direction, which allows for the quantization of
Landau levels through the generated pseudomagnetic field. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the existence and robustness of the chiral zeroth Landau level. The
unique elastic snake state is realized using the coupling between the zeroth
and the first Landau levels. Our results, supported by theory and simulations,
establish a feasible framework for generating pseudomagnetic fields in origami
metamaterials with potential applications in waveguides and cloaking.

<h3>Observation of giant nonreciprocal charge transport from quantum Hall  edge states of single surface in topological insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08917" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08917</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Symmetry breaking in quantum materials is of great importance and leads to
novel nonreciprocal charge transport. The topological insulator system provides
a unique platform to study nonreciprocal charge transport due to the exotic
surface state. But it is typically small in magnitude because the contributions
from the top and bottom surface of topological insulator are usually opposite.
Here, we report the observation of giant nonreciprocal charge transport
mediated by the quantum Hall state in intrinsic topological insulator
Sn-Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S devices, which is attributed to the coexistence of quantum
Hall states and Dirac surface states. A giant nonreciprocal coefficient of up
to 2.26*10^5 A^-1 is found, because only a single surface of topological
insulator contributes to the nonreciprocal charge transport. Our work not only
reveals the intrinsic properties of nonreciprocal charge transport in
topological insulators, but also paves the way for future electronic devices.

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnetic L1_2-Mn_3Ir combines outstanding spin-transport properties
with magnons in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. However, the THz radiation
emitted by ultrafast spin-to-charge conversion via the inverse spin Hall effect
remains unexplored. In this study, we measured the THz emission and
transmission of a permalloy/(111)-oriented L1_2-Mn_3Ir multilayer by THz
time-domain spectroscopy. The spin Hall angle was determined to be
approximately constant at 0.024 within a frequency range of 0.3-2.2 THz, in
comparison with the THz spectroscopy of a permalloy/Pt multilayer. Our results
not only demonstrate the potential of L1_2-Mn_3Ir as a spintronic THz emitter
but also provide insights into the THz spin transport properties of
L1_2-Mn_3Ir.

<h3>On-the-fly machine learning for parametrization of the effective  Hamiltonian</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian is widely used to predict
and simulate the properties of ferroelectrics and relaxor ferroelectrics.
However, the parametrization method of the effective Hamiltonian is complicated
and hardly can resolve the systems with complex interactions and/or complex
components. Here, we developed an on-the-fly machine learning approach to
parametrize the effective Hamiltonian based on Bayesian linear regression. The
parametrization is completed in molecular dynamics simulations, with the
energy, forces and stress predicted at each step along with their
uncertainties. First-principles calculations are executed when the
uncertainties are large to retrain the parameters. This approach provides a
universal and automatic way to compute the effective Hamiltonian parameters for
any considered systems including complex systems which previous methods can not
handle. BaTiO3 and Pb(Sc,Ta)O3 are taken as examples to show the accurateness
of this approach comparing with conventional first-principles parametrization
method.

<h3>The transport properties of Kekulé-ordered graphene $p$-$n$ junctions</h3>

<br>
The transport properties of electrons in graphene $p$-$n$ junction with
uniform Kekul\'e lattice distortion have been studied using the tight-binding
model and the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism combined with the nonequilibrium
Green's function method. In the Kekul\'e-ordered graphene, the original $K$ and
$K^{\prime}$ valleys of the pristine graphene are folded together due to the
$\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ enlargement of the primitive cell. When the valley
coupling breaks the chiral symmetry, special transport properties of Dirac
electrons exist in the Kekul\'e lattice. In the O-shaped Kekul\'e graphene
$p$-$n$ junction, Klein tunneling is suppressed, and only resonance tunneling
occurs. In the Y-shaped Kekul\'e graphene $p$-$n$ junction, the transport of
electrons is dominated by Klein tunneling. When the on-site energy modification
is introduced into the Y-shaped Kekul\'e structure, both Klein tunneling and
resonance tunneling occur, and the electron tunneling is enhanced. In the
presence of a strong magnetic field, the conductance of O-shaped and on-site
energy-modified Y-shaped Kekul\'e graphene $p$-$n$ junctions is non-zero due to
the occurrence of resonance tunneling. It is also found that the disorder can
enhance conductance, with conductance plateaus forming in the appropriate range
of disorder strength. The ideal plateau value is found only in the Kekul\'e-Y
system.

<h3>Continuum modeling of size-segregation and flow in dense, bidisperse  granular media: Accounting for segregation driven by both pressure gradients  and shear-strain-rate gradients</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08942" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08942</a>
<br>
<i>Harkirat Singh, Daren Liu, David L. Henann</i>
<br>
<br>
Dense mixtures of particles of varying size tend to segregate based on size
during flow. Granular size-segregation plays an important role in many
industrial and geophysical processes, but the development of coupled, continuum
models capable of predicting the evolution of segregation dynamics and flow
fields in dense granular media across different geometries has remained a
longstanding challenge. One reason is because size-segregation stems from two
driving forces: (1) pressure gradients and (2) shear-strain-rate gradients.
Another reason is due to the challenge of integrating segregation models with
rheological constitutive equations for dense granular flow. In this paper, we
build upon our prior work, which combined a model for
shear-strain-rate-gradient-driven segregation with a nonlocal continuum model
for dense granular flow rheology, and append a model for
pressure-gradient-driven segregation. We perform discrete element method (DEM)
simulations of dense flow of bidisperse granular systems in two flow
geometries, in which both segregation driving forces are present: namely,
inclined plane flow and planar shear flow with gravity. Steady-state DEM data
from inclined plane flow is used to determine the dimensionless material
parameters in the pressure-gradient-driven segregation model for both spheres
and disks. Then, predictions of the coupled, continuum model accounting for
both driving forces are tested against DEM simulation results across different
cases of both inclined plane flow and planar shear flow with gravity, while
varying parameters such as the size of the flow geometry, the driving
conditions of flow, and the initial conditions. Overall, we find that it is
crucial to account for both driving forces to capture segregation dynamics in
dense, bidisperse granular media across both flow geometries with a single set
of parameters.

Electrochemical reactions represent essential processes in fundamental
chemistry that foster a wide range of applications. Although most
electrochemical reactions in bulk substances can be well described by the
classical Marcus-Gerischer charge transfer theory, the realistic reaction
character and mechanism in dimensionally confined systems remain unknown. Here,
we report the multiparametric survey on the kinetics of lateral photooxidation
in structurally identical WS2 and MoS2 monolayers, where electrochemical
oxidation occurs at the atomically thin monolayer edges. The oxidation rate is
correlated quantitatively with various crystallographic and environmental
parameters, including the density of reactive sites, humidity, temperature, and
illumination fluence. In particular, we observe distinctive reaction barriers
of 1.4 and 0.9 eV for the two structurally identical semiconductors and uncover
an unusual non-Marcusian charge transfer mechanism in these dimensionally
confined monolayers due to the limit in reactant supplies. A scenario of band
bending is proposed to explain the discrepancy in reaction barriers. These
results add important knowledge into the fundamental electrochemical reaction
theory in low-dimensional systems.

We propose a novel bound on the mimimum dissipation required in any
circumstances to transfer a certain amount of charge through any resistive
device. We illustrate it on the task of writing a logical 1 (encoded as a
prescribed voltage) into a capacitance, through various linear or nonlinear
devices. We show that, even though the celebrated Landauer bound (which only
applies to bit erasure) does not apply here, one can still formulate a "non-
Landauer" lower bound on dissipation, that crucially depends on the time budget
to perform the operation, as well as the average conductance of the driving
device. We compare our bound with empirical results reported in the literature
and realistic simulations of CMOS pass and transmission gates in decananometer
technology. Our non-Landauer bound turns out to be a quantitative benchmark to
assess the (non-)optimality of a writing operation.

<br>
Graphene oxide (GO) is one of the important functional materials. Large-scale
synthesis of it is very challenging. Following a simple cost-effective route,
large-scale GO was produced by mechanical (ball) milling, in air, of carbon
nanoparticles (CNPs) present in carbon soot in the present study. The thickness
of the GO layer was seen to decrease with an increase in milling time. Ball
milling provided the required energy to acquire the in-plane graphitic order in
the CNPs reducing the disorders in it. As the surface area of the layered
structure became more and more with the increase in milling time, more and more
oxygen of air got attached to the carbon in graphene leading to the formation
of GO. An increase in the time of the ball mill up to 5 hours leads to a
significant increase in the content of GO. Thus ball milling can be useful to
produce large-scale two-dimensional GO for a short time.

We show the relationship between the strongly non-linear limit (also termed
the dispersionless or the Whitham limit) of the macroscopic fluctuation theory
of certain statistical models and the inverse scattering method. We show that
in the strongly non-linear limit the inverse scattering problem can be solved
using the steepest descent method of the associated Riemann--Hilbert problem.
The importance of establishing this connection, is that the equations in the
strongly non-linear limit can often be solved exactly by simple means, the
connection then provides a limit in which one can solve the inverse scattering
problem, thus aiding potentially the exact solution of a particular large
deviation problem.

Because of their long coherence time and compatibility with industrial
foundry processes, electron spin qubits are a promising platform for scalable
quantum processors. A full-fledged quantum computer will need quantum error
correction, which requires high-fidelity quantum gates. Analyzing and
mitigating the gate errors are useful to improve the gate fidelity. Here, we
demonstrate a simple yet reliable calibration procedure for a high-fidelity
controlled-rotation gate in an exchange-always-on Silicon quantum processor
allowing operation above the fault-tolerance threshold of quantum error
correction. We find that the fidelity of our uncalibrated controlled-rotation
gate is limited by coherent errors in the form of controlled-phases and present
a method to measure and correct these phase errors. We then verify the
improvement in our gate fidelities by randomized benchmark and gate-set
tomography protocols. Finally, we use our phase correction protocol to
implement a virtual, high-fidelity controlled-phase gate.

Chalcogen vacancies in transition metal dichalcogenides are widely
acknowledged as both donor dopants and as a source of disorder. The electronic
structure of sulphur vacancies in MoS2 however is still controversial, with
discrepancies in the literature pertaining to the origin of the in-gap features
observed via scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on single sulphur vacancies.
Here we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and STS to
study embedded sulphur vacancies in bulk MoS2 crystals. We observe
spectroscopic features dispersing in real space and in energy, which we
interpret as tip position- and bias-dependent ionization of the sulphur vacancy
donor due to tip induced band bending (TIBB). The observations indicate that
care must be taken in interpreting defect spectra as reflecting in-gap density
of states, and may explain discrepancies in the literature.

Topological insulators are emerging materials with insulating bulk and
symmetry protected nontrivial surface states. One of the most fascinating
transport behaviors in a topological insulator is the quantized anomalous Hall
insulator, which has been observed inmagnetic-topological-insulator-based
devices. In this work, we report a successful doping of rare earth element Tb
into Bi$_{1.08}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S topological insulator single crystals, in
which the Tb moments are antiferromagnetically ordered below ~10 K. Benefiting
from the in-bulk-gap Fermi level, transport behavior dominant by the
topological surface states is observed below ~ 150 K. At low temperatures,
strong Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are observed, which exhibit 2D-like
behavior. The topological insulator with long range magnetic ordering in rare
earth doped Bi$_{1.08}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S single crystal provides an ideal
platform for quantum transport studies and potential applications.

Disordered thin films are a common choice of material for superconducting,
high impedance circuits used in quantum information or particle detector
physics. A wide selection of materials with different levels of granularity are
available, but, despite low microwave losses being reported for some, the high
degree of disorder always implies the presence of intrinsic defects.
Prominently, quantum circuits are prone to interact with two-level systems
(TLS), typically originating from solid state defects in the dielectric parts
of the circuit, like surface oxides or tunneling barriers. We present an
experimental investigation of TLS in granular aluminum thin films under applied
mechanical strain and electric fields. The analysis reveals a class of strongly
coupled TLS having electric dipole moments up to 30 eA, an order of magnitude
larger than dipole moments commonly reported for solid state defects. Notably,
these large dipole moments appear more often in films with a higher
resistivity. Our observations shed new light on granular superconductors and
may have implications for their usage as a quantum circuit material.

We have performed $^{115}$In-NMR spectroscopy for Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$ with
corundum-related crystal structure to reveal magnetic structures that develop
in high magnetic fields. At low fields Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$ shows a helical
magnetic order with a long wavelength because of its chiral and polar crystal
structure. The field-induced magnetic state was not investigated by microscopic
experiment because an extremely high magnetic field is required to modify the
antiferromagnetically coupled helical structure. From the analysis of our
$^{115}$In-NMR spectra obtained at high magnetic fields, we confirm that the
canted antiferromagnetic structure appears in fields applied in the $[110]$
direction and the propagation vector of magnetic helix is rotated toward the
field direction for fields in the $[001]$ direction. We discuss the effect of
magnetic field that modifies the magnetic structure of an antiferromagnetic
chiral magnet.

Doping substantially influences the electronic and photophysical properties
of semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs). Although prior
studies have noted that surplus charge carriers modify optical spectra and
accelerate non-radiative exciton decay in doped s-SWNTs, a direct mechanistic
correlation of trion formation, exciton dynamics and energetics remains
elusive. This work examines the influence of doping-induced non-radiative decay
and exciton confinement on s-SWNT photophysics. Using photoluminescence,
continuous-wave absorption, and pump-probe spectroscopy, we show that
localization of and barrier formation by trapped charges can be jointly
quantified using diffusive exciton transport- and particle-in-the-box models,
yielding a one-to-one correlation between charge carrier concentrations derived
from these models. The study highlights the multifaceted role of exohedral
counterions, which trap charges to create quenching sites, form barriers to
exciton movement, and host trion states. This contributes significantly to
understanding and optimizing the photophysical properties of doped SWNTs.

The extraordinary chemical diversity of MAX phases raises the question of how
many and which novel ones are yet to be discovered. The conventional schemes
rely either on executions of well designed experiments or elaborately crafted
calculations; both of which have been key tactics within the past several
decades that have yielded many of important new materials we are studying and
using today. However, these approaches are expensive despite the emergence of
high throughput automations or evolution of high speed computers. In this work,
we have revisited the in prior proposed light duty strategy, i.e. structure
mapping, for describing the genomic conditions under which one MAX phase could
form; that allow us to make successful formability and non formability
separation of MAX phases with a fidelity of 95.5%. Our results suggest that the
proposed coordinates, and further the developed structure maps, are able to
offer a useful initial guiding principles for systematic screenings of
potential MAX phases and provide untapped opportunities for their structure
prediction and materials design.

<h3>Is there a relationship between wettability and rates of equilibration  of the H-bonded oligomer PMMS under confinement?</h3>

In this paper, we investigated the annealing experiments of
poly(mercaptopropylmethylsiloxane, PMMS) confined within two types of porous
templates (anodic aluminium oxide, AAO, and silica) characterized by different
pore diameter, d= 8-120nm, using different thermal protocols (varying
significantly in cooling/heating rate) by means of Broadband Dielectric
Spectroscopy (BDS) supported by the complementary Differential Scanning
Calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-dependent contact angle, {\theta},
measurements. It was found that relaxation times obtained from routine
temperature-dependent dielectric investigations deviate from the bulk behavior
when approaching the glass transition temperature. Importantly, this
confinement induced effect can be easily removed by the annealing experiments
performed at some specific range of temperatures. The analysis of the
dielectric data collected during isothermal experiments of confined samples
that was beforehand cooled with different rates revealed that (i) constant
rates of annealing gets longer with cooling and weakly depend on the rate of
cooling, and (ii) activation energy of the equilibration process, E_a, varies
with the reduction of the pore diameter and material the porous template is
made of. In fact, there is significant reduction in E_a from ~62 to ~23 kJ/mol
obtained for the annealing process carried out in AAO (d= 10 nm) and silica (d=
8 nm) membranes, respectively. Such significant change in E_a can be explained
taking into account temperature-dependence of {\theta} of PMMS indicating a
notable change in wettability between both surfaces upon cooling. As a
consequence, one can expect that the mass exchange between interfacial and core
molecules as well as adsorption-desorption processes occurring at the interface
at lower temperatures must be affected.

The two-dimensional quantum spin-$S=1$ square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ $XY$ model
with the single-ion anisotropy $D$ was investigated numerically, placing an
emphasis on the end-point singularity of the phase boundary separating the $XY$
and paramagnetic phases in proximity to the fully frustrated point, $J_2/J_1
\to 0.5^{-}$. We employed the exact diagonalization method to circumvent the
negative sign problem of the quantum Monte Carlo method, and evaluated the
fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F$ as a probe to detect the phase transition. As
a preliminary survey, for an intermediate value of $J_2/J_1$, the $D$-driven
$XY$-paramagnetic phase transition was investigated via the probe $\chi_F$. It
turned out that the criticality belongs to the $3$D-$XY$ universality class.
Thereby, the $\chi_F$ data were cast into the crossover-scaling formula with
the properly scaled distance from the multi-critical point, $0.5-J_2/J_1$. The
set of multi-critical indices were obtained, and compared to those of the
quantum Lifshitz criticality.

We report the synthesis of transition-metal-doped ferromagnetic elemental
single-crystal semiconductors with quantum oscillations using the physical
vapor transport method. The 7.7 atom% Cr-doped Te crystals (Cr_Te) show
ferromagnetism, butterfly-like negative magnetoresistance in the low
temperature (< 3.8 K) and low field (< 0.15 T) region, and high Hall mobility,
e.g., 1320 cm2 V-1 s-1 at 30 K and 350 cm2 V-1 s-1 at 300 K, implying that
Cr_Te crystals are ferromagnetic elemental semiconductors. When B // c // I,
the maximum negative MR is -27% at T = 20 K and B = 8 T. In the low temperature
semiconducting region, Cr_Te crystals show strong discrete scale invariance
dominated logarithmic quantum oscillations when the direction of the magnetic
field B is parallel to the [100] crystallographic direction and show Landau
quantization dominated Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations for B // [210]
direction, which suggests the broken rotation symmetry of the Fermi pockets in
the Cr_Te crystals. The findings of coexistence of multiple quantum
oscillations and ferromagnetism in such an elemental quantum material may
inspire more study of narrow bandgap semiconductors with ferromagnetism and

The electronic, thermal, magnetic and optical properties of BN-codoped
strontium oxide (SrO) monolayers are studied taking into account the
interaction effects between the B and the N dopant atoms. The indirect band gap
of a pure two dimensional SrO is modified to a narrow direct band gap by tuning
the B-N attractive interaction. The B or N separately doped SrO leads to a
metallic behavior, while a BN-codoped SrO has a semiconductor character. The
strong B-N attractive interaction changes a non-magnetic SrO to a magnetic
system and reduces its heat capacity. An ab initio molecular dynamics, AIMD,
calculations are also utilized to check the thermodynamic stability of the pure
and BN-codoped SrO monolayers. The band gap reduction of SrO increases the
optical conductivity shifting the most intense peak from the Deep-UV to the
visible light region. The red shifted optical conductivity emerges due to the
B-N attractive interaction. In addition, both iso- and anisotropic characters
are seen in the optical properties depending on the strength of the B-N
attractive interaction. It can thus be confirmed that the interaction effects
of the BN-codopants can be used to control the properties of SrO monolayers for
thermo- and opto-electronic devices.

<br>
We investigate the electronic, the thermal, and the optical properties of
BN-codoped MgO monolayers taking into account the interaction effects between
the B and the N dopant atoms. The relatively wide indirect band gap of a pure
MgO nanosheet can be changed to a narrow direct band gap by tuning the B-N
attractive interaction. The band gap reduction does not only enhance the
optical properties, including the absorption spectra and the optical
conductivity, but also the most intense peak is shifted from the Deep-UV to the
visible light region. The red shifting of the absorption spectra and the
optical conductivity are caused by the attractive interaction. In addition,
both isotropic and anisotropic characteristics are seen in the optical
properties depending on the strength of the B-N attractive interaction. The
heat capacity is reduced for the BN-doped MgO monolayer, which can be referred
to changes in the bond dissociation energy. The bond dissociation energy
decreases as the difference in the electronegativities of the bonded atoms
decreases. The lower difference in the electronegativities leads to a weaker
endothermic process resulting in reduction of the heat capacity. An ab initio
molecular dynamics, AIMD, calculation is utilized to check the thermodynamic
stability of the pure and the BN-codoped MgO monolayers. We thus confirm that
the BN-codopant atoms can be used to gain control of the properties of MgO
monolayers for thermo- and opto-electronic devices.

It has been more than 40 years since superconductivity was discovered in
organic conductors, and the way scientists view organic superconductors has
changed over time. At first, the fact that organic conductors exhibit
superconductivity was a novelty in itself, and subsequently it was shown that
behind the superconductivity is the physics of electron correlation, which has
been a focus in condensed matter physics at large. Amid the remarkable
development of correlation physics, the unique characteristics of organic
conductors, e.g., a variety of lattice geometries and the highly compressible
feature, led to the elucidation of fundamental principles and the finding of
new phenomena, such as bandwidth-controlled Mott transitions and possible
quantum spin liquids. However, most organic superconductors have commensurate
band fillings, such as a half or a quarter, whereas inorganic superconductors,
such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates and iron-based superconductors, have often
been investigated under the variation of their band fillings. Thus, the
physical linkage between organic and inorganic superconductors has remained
unresolved. In this review article, we focus on the layered nonstoichiometric
superconductor, $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$, which is exceptional
among organic conductors in that the nonstoichiometry serves as doping to a
half-filled band. Moreover, the strong correlation of electrons and a
geometrically frustrated triangular lattice make this system exhibit the unique
phenomena involved in Mottness, spin liquidity, and superconductivity, which
are key concepts of correlated electron physics. This review will summarize
what we learned from the pressure study of
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ and how they relate to the extensively
studied issues in inorganic materials.

Carbon mitigation is one challenging issue that the world is facing. To
tackle deleterious impacts of CO2, processes emerged, including chemisorption
from amine based solvents, and more recently physisorption in porous solids.
While CO2 capture from amine is more mature, this process is corrosive and
detrimental for environment. Physisorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
is currently attracting a considerable attention, however the selection of the
optimum sorbent is still challenging. While CO2 adsorption by MOFs have been
widely explored from a thermodynamics standpoint, dynamical aspects remain less
explored. CALF-20(Zn) MOF was recently proposed as a promising alternative to
the commercially used CO2 13X zeolite sorbents, however, in-depth understanding
of microscopic mechanisms originating its good performance still have to be
achieved. In this report, we deliver a microscopic insight of CO2 and H2O in
CALF-20(Zn) by atomistic simulations. CALF-20(Zn) revealed to exhibit
unconventional guest-host behaviors that give rise to abnormal thermodynamic
and diffusion. The hydrophobic nature of the solid leads to a low water
adsorption enthalpy at low loading followed by a gradual increase, driven by
strong water hydrogen bonds, found to arrange as quasi 1D water wires in MOF
porosity, recalling water behavior in carbon nanotubes and aquaporins. While no
super-diffusion found, this behavior was shown to impact diffusion along with
guests loading, with a minimum correlated with inflection point of adsorption
isotherm corresponding to wires formation. Interestingly, diffusion of both CO2
and H2O were also found to be of the same order of magnitude with similar
non-linear behaviors.

Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductors with electrically
addressable polarization present opportunities for integrating ferroelectrics
into high-density ultrathin nanoelectronics. However, efforts to improve
critical characteristics such as switching speed and endurance of 2D
ferroelectric-based devices have been hampered by the limited microscopic
understanding of ferroelectric switching in 2D. Taking 2D $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$
with out-of-plane polarization as a model, we employ deep-learning-assisted
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the switching processes
of 2D domains and 1D domain walls, revealing mechanisms fundamentally different
from those of bulk ferroelectrics. We discover that a single domain is
unswitchable by an out-of-plane electric field due to forbidden splitting of
Wyckoff orbits. This "splitting restriction principle" also explains the robust
POP presented in sliding ferroelectricity and moir\'e ferroelectricity.
Counterintuitively, 1D domain walls are easily moved by in-plane fields despite
lacking in-plane effective polarization. The field-driven 1D walls exhibit
unusual avalanche dynamics characterized by abrupt, intermittent moving
patterns. The propagating velocity at various temperatures, field orientations,
and strengths can be statistically described with a single creep equation,
featuring a dynamical exponent of 2 that is distinct from all known values for
elastic interfaces moving in disordered media. We demonstrate a tunable onset
field for the intrinsic creep-depinning transition, suggesting a simple route
for on-demand configuration of switching speed.

Studies of the formation of Landau levels based on the Schr\"odinger equation
for electrons constrained to curved surfaces have a long history. These include
as prime examples surfaces with constant positive and negative curvature, the
sphere [Phys. Rev. Lett. 51, 605 (1983)] and the pseudosphere [Annals of
Physics 173, 185 (1987)]. Now, topological insulators, hosting Dirac-type
surface states, provide a unique platform to experimentally examine such
quantum Hall physics in curved space. Hence, extending previous work we
consider solutions of the Dirac equation for the pseudosphere for both, the
case of an overall perpendicular magnetic field and a homogeneous coaxial,
thereby locally varying, magnetic field. For both magnetic-field
configurations, we provide analytical solutions for spectra and eigenstates.
For the experimentally relevant case of a coaxial magnetic field we find that
the Landau levels split and show a peculiar scaling $\propto B^{1/4}$, thereby
characteristically differing from the usual linear $B$ and $B^{1/2}$ dependence
of the planar Schr\"odinger and Dirac case, respectively. We compare our
analytical findings to numerical results that we also extend to the case of the
Minding surface.

following valley-selective carrier excitation with circularly-polarized light.
Our numerical investigations treat the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and
phonons on equal footing within a parameter-free ab-initio framework. We report
the emergence of valley-polarized phonon populations in monolayer MoS$_2$ that
can be selectively excited at either the K or K' valleys depending on the light
helicity. The resulting vibrational state is characterized by a distinctive
chirality, which lifts time-reversal symmetry of the lattice on transient
timescales. We show that chiral valley phonons can further lead to fingerprints
of vibrational dichroism detectable by ultrafast diffuse scattering and
persisting beyond 10 ps. The valley polarization of nonequilibrium phonon
populations could be exploited as information carrier, thereby extending the
paradigm of valleytronics to the domain of vibrational excitations.

<h3>Universal scaling near band-tuned metal-insulator phase transitions</h3>

We present a theory for band-tuned metal-insulator transitions based on the
Kubo formalism. Such a transition exhibits scaling of the resistivity curves,
in the regime where $T\tau >1$ or $\mu \tau>1$, where $\tau$ is the scattering
time and $\mu$ the chemical potential. At the critical value of the chemical
potential, the resistivity diverges as a power law, $R_c \sim 1/T$.
Consequently, on the metallic side there is a regime with negative $dR/dT$,
which is often misinterpreted as insulating. We show that scaling and this
`fake insulator' regime is observed in a wide range of experimental systems. In
particular, we show that Mooij correlations in high-temperature metals with
negative $dR/dT$ can be quantitatively understood with our scaling theory in
the presence of $T$-linear scattering.

Moir\'e materials have recently been established experimentally as a
highly-tunable condensed matter platform, facilitating the controlled
manipulation of band structures and interactions. In several of these moir\'e
materials, Dirac cones are present in the low-energy regime near the Fermi
level. Thus, fermionic excitations emerging in these materials close to the
Dirac cones have a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi surface as
massless relativistic Dirac fermions. Here, we study low-energy fermionic
excitations of moir\'e Dirac materials in the presence of a mass gap that may
be generated by symmetry breaking. Introducing a dynamical Fermi velocity
and/or time-dependent mass gap for the Dirac quasiparticles, we exhibit the
emergence of an analog of cosmological fermion pair production in terms of
observables such as the expected occupation number or two-point correlation
functions. We find that it is necessary and sufficient for quasiparticle
production that only the ratio between the mass gap and the Fermi velocity is
time-dependent. In this way, we establish that moir\'e Dirac materials can
serve as analog models for cosmological spacetime geometries, in particular,
for Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker expanding cosmologies. We briefly
discuss possibilities for experimental realization.

<h3>Giant anisotropic band flattening from moiré engineering in $Γ$  valley semiconductors</h3>

We propose a theory of anisotropic band flattening in moir\'e systems at the
$\Gamma$ valley. We find that in twisted anisotropic two-dimensional crystals
with a rectangular unit cell of $C_{2z}$ or mirror symmetries, a larger
effective mass anisotropy $\eta=m_y/m_x$ has a stronger tendency to be further
enhanced compared to that of monolayer, which leads to correlated physics in
one dimension effectively. We predict twisted bilayer black phosphorus (tBBP)
has giant anisotropic flattened moir\'e bands ($\eta\sim10^4$) from ab initio
calculations and continuum model, where the low energy physics is described by
the weakly coupled array of one-dimensional wires. We further calculate the
phase diagram based on sliding Luttinger liquid by including the screened
Coulomb interactions in tBBP, and find a large parameter space may host the
non-Fermi liquid phase. We thus establish tBBP as a promising and
experimentally accessible platform for exploring correlated physics in low
dimensions.

The dynamics of a system composed of inelastic hard spheres or disks that are
confined between two parallel vertically vibrating walls is studied (the
vertical direction is defined as the direction perpendicular to the walls). The
distance between the two walls is supposed to be larger than twice the diameter
of the particles so that the particles can pass over each other, but still much
smaller than the dimensions of the walls. Hence, the system can be considered
to be quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-one-dimensional) in the hard spheres (disks)
case. For dilute systems, a closed evolution equation for the one-particle
distribution function is formulated that takes into account the effects of the
confinement. Assuming the system is spatially homogeneous, the kinetic equation
is solved approximating the distribution function by a two-temperatures
(horizontal and vertical) gaussian distribution. The obtained evolution
equations for the partial temperatures are solved, finding a very good
agreement with Molecular Dynamics simulation results for a wide range of the
parameters (inelasticity, height and density) for states whose projection over
a plane parallel to the walls is homogeneous. In the stationary state, where
the energy lost in collisions is compensated by the energy injected by the
walls, the pressure tensor in the horizontal direction is analyzed and its
relation with an instability of the homogenous state observed in the
simulations is discussed.

<h3>The effect of disorder on phases across two-dimensional thermal melting</h3>

We study melting in a two-dimensional system of classical particles with
Gaussian-core interactions in disordered environments. The pure system
validates the conventional two-step melting with a hexatic phase intervening
between the solid and the liquid. This picture is modified in the presence of
pinning impurities. A random distribution of pinning centers forces a
hexatic-like low temperature phase that transits into a liquid at a single
melting temperature $T^{\rm RP}_{\rm m}$. In contrast, pinning centers located
at randomly chosen sites of a perfect crystal anchors a solid at low
temperatures which undergoes a direct transition to the liquid at $T^{\rm
CP}_{\rm m}$. Thus, the two-step melting is lost in either cases of disorder.
We discuss the characteristics of melting depending on the nature of the
impurities.

The local magnetic properties of Yb$^{3+}$ in the layered honeycomb material
YbCl$_{3}$ were investigated by electron spin resonance on single crystals. For
in-plane and out-of-plane field orientations the $g$-factor shows a clear
anisotropy ($g_\|=2.97(8)$ and $g_\bot =1.53(4)$), whereas the low temperature
exchange coupling and the spin relaxation display a rather isotropic character.
At elevated temperatures the contribution of the first excited crystal field
level ($21\pm2$~meV) dominates the spin relaxation.

Designing smart devices with tunable shapes has important applications in
industrial manufacture. In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear deformation
and the morphological transitions between buckling, necking, and snap-through
instabilities of layered DE balloons in response to an applied radial voltage
and an inner pressure. We propose a general mathematical theory of nonlinear
electro-elasticity able to account for finite inhomogeneous strains provoked by
the electro-mechanical coupling. We investigate the onsets of morphological
transitions of the spherically symmetric balloons using the surface impedance
matrix method. Moreover, we study the nonlinear evolution of the bifurcated
branches through finite element numerical simulations. Our analysis
demonstrates the possibility to design tunable DE spheres, where the onset of
buckling and necking can be controlled by geometrical and mechanical properties
of the passive elastic layers. Relevant applications include soft robotics and
mechanical actuators.

<h3>Unearthing the foundational role of anharmonicity in heat transport in  glasses</h3>

The time-honored Allen-Feldman theory of heat transport in glasses is
generally assumed to predict a finite value for the thermal conductivity, even
if it neglects the anharmonic broadening of vibrational normal modes. We
demonstrate that the harmonic approximation predicts that the bulk lattice
thermal conductivity of harmonic solids inevitably diverges at any temperature,
irrespective of configurational disorder, and that its ability to represent the
heat-transport properties observed experimentally in most glasses is implicitly
due to finite-size effects. Our theoretical analysis is thoroughly benchmarked
against careful numerical simulations. Our findings thus reveal that a proper
account of anharmonic effects is indispensable to predict a finite value for
the bulk thermal conductivity in any solid material, be it crystalline or
glassy.

<h3>Nonlocal thermoelectric detection of interaction and correlations in  edge states</h3>

We investigate nonequilibrium effects in the transport of interacting
electrons in quantum conductors, proposing the nonlocal thermoelectric response
as a direct indicator of the presence of interactions, nonthermal states and
the effect of correlations. This is done by assuming a quantum Hall setup where
two channels (connected to reservoirs at different temperatures) co-propagate
for a finite distance, such that a thermoelectrical response is only expected
if the electron-electron interaction mediates heat exchange between the
channels. This way, the nonlocal Seebeck response measures the interaction
strength. Considering zero-range interactions, we solve the charge and energy
currents and noises of a non-equilibrium integrable interacting system,
determining the universal interaction-dependent length scale of energy
equilibration. Further, a setup with two controllable quantum point contacts
allows thermoelectricity to monitor the interacting system thermalisation as
well as the fundamental role of cross-correlations in the heat exchange at
intermediate length scales.

Strange metals arise in a variety of platforms for strongly correlated
electrons, ranging from the cuprates, heavy fermions to flat band systems.
Motivated by recent experiments in kagome metals, we study a Hubbard model on a
kagome lattice whose noninteracting limit contains flat bands. A Kondo lattice
description is constructed, in which the degrees of freedom are exponentially
localized molecular orbitals. We identify an orbital-selective Mott transition
through an extended dynamical mean field theory of the effective model. The
transition describes a quantum critical point at which quasiparticles are
expected to be lost and strange metallicity emerges. Our theoretical work opens
up a new route for realizing beyond-Landau quantum criticality and emergent
quantum phases that it nucleates.

<h3>Towards understanding the electronic structure of the simpler members of  two-dimensional halide-perovskites</h3>

In this paper we analyze the band-structure of two-dimensional (2D) halide
perovskites by considering structures related to the simpler case of the
series, (BA)$_2$PbI$_4$, in which PbI$_4$ layers are intercalated with
butylammonium (BA=CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_3$NH$_3$) organic ligands. We use
density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculations and tight-binding (TB)
models aiming to discover a simple description of the bands in the vicinity of
the valence-band maximum and the conduction-band minimum. We find that the
atomic orbitals of the butylammonium chains have negligible contribution to the
Bloch states which form the conduction and valence bands in near the Fermi
energy. Our calculations reveal a rather universal, i.e., independent of the
intercalating BA, rigid-band picture characteristic of the layered perovskite
``matrix''. Besides demonstrating the above conclusion, the main goal of this
paper is to find accurate TB models which capture the essential features of the
DFT bands near the Fermi energy. First, we ignore electron hopping along the
$c$-axis and the octahedral distortions and this increased symmetry halves the
Bravais-lattice unit-cell size and the Brillouin zone unfolds to a 45$^{\circ}$
rotated square and this allows some analytical handling of the 2D
TB-Hamiltonian. The Pb $6s$ and I $5s$ orbitals are far away from the Fermi
level and, thus, we integrate them out to obtain an effective model which only
includes hybridized Pb $6p$ and I $5p$ states. Our TB-based treatment a)
provides a good quantitative description of the DFT band-structure, b) helps us
conceptualize the complex electronic structure in the family of these materials
in a simple way and c) yields the one-body part to be combined with
appropriately screened electron interaction to describe many-body effects, such
as excitonic bound-states.
