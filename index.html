<h3>Room-temperature quantum oscillations of static magnetic susceptibility  of silicon-carbide epitaxial layers grown on a silicon substrate by the  method of the coordinated substitution of atoms</h3>

The article presents the results of measurement and analysis of the field
dependences of the static magnetic susceptibility of thin epitaxial silicon
carbide films grown on the (110) surface of single-crystal silicon by the
method of the coordinated substitution of atoms. In weak magnetic fields, the
occurrence of two quantum effects at room temperature was experimentally found:
the hysteresis of the static magnetic susceptibility and, in the field
dependences, quantum Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of the static magnetic
susceptibility. The simultaneous occurrence of these effects is a consequence
of two- and one-particle interference of charge carriers (two-dimensional
holes) on microdefects consisting of dipole centers with negative correlation
energy (negative-U dipole centers).

<h3>Comment on "Direct observation of anyonic braiding statistics", by  Nakamura et al, Nature Physics, volume 16, page 931 (2020)</h3>

We comment on the significance of the results in the paper cited in the
title. The experimental result measures the phase for a repeated elementary
exchange of two identical quasiparticles, and shows that the quasiparticles are
anyons. The value of the phase agrees with theoretical predictions. However, in
terms of the statistics parameter $\theta$ for a single elementary exchange, it
determines $2\theta$ modulo $2\pi$, and hence $\theta$ only modulo $\pi$, not
modulo $2\pi$, and so does not fully check the theoretical prediction for the
braiding statistics of charge $e/3$ quasiparticles. This is a general
shortcoming of this particular type of interference measurement of statistics.

<h3>Stability of topological superconducting qubits with number conservation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12995" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12995</a>

The study of topological superconductivity is largely based on the analysis
of simple mean-field models that do not conserve particle number. A major open
question in the field is whether the remarkable properties of these mean-field
models persist in more realistic models with a conserved total particle number
and long-range interactions. For applications to quantum computation, two key
properties that one would like to verify in more realistic models are (i) the
existence of a set of low-energy states (the qubit states) that are separated
from the rest of the spectrum by a finite energy gap, and (ii) an exponentially
small (in system size) bound on the splitting of the energies of the qubit
states. It is well known that these properties hold for mean-field models, but
so far only property (i) has been verified in a number-conserving model. In
this work we fill this gap by rigorously establishing both properties (i) and
(ii) for a number-conserving toy model of two topological superconducting wires
coupled to a single bulk superconductor. Our result holds in a broad region of
the parameter space of this model, suggesting that properties (i) and (ii) are
robust properties of number-conserving models, and not just artifacts of the
mean-field approximation.

<h3>The disordered Dicke model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12996</a>
<br>
<i>Pragna Das, Sebastian Wüster, Auditya Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce and study the disordered Dicke model in which the spin-boson
couplings are drawn from a random distribution with some finite width.
Regarding the quantum phase transition we show that when the standard deviation
$\sigma$ of the coupling strength gradually increases, the critical value of
the mean coupling strength $\mu$ gradually decreases and after a certain
$\sigma$ there is no quantum phase transition at all; the system always lies in
the super-radiant phase. We derive an approximate expression for the quantum
phase transition in the presence of disorder in terms of $\mu$ and $\sigma$,
which we numerically verify. Studying the thermal phase transition in the
disordered Dicke model, we obtain an analytical expression for the critical
temperature in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the coupling
strength. We observe that even when the mean of the coupling strength is zero,
there is a finite temperature transition if the standard deviation of the
coupling is sufficiently high. Disordered couplings in the Dicke model will
exist in quantum dot superlattices, and we also sketch how they can be
engineered and controlled with ultracold atoms or molecules in a cavity.

<h3>Hydrogen bonding dynamics and supramolecular dynamics of monohydroxy  alcohols</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13013" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13013</a>
<br>
<i>Shinian Cheng, Shalin Patil, Shiwang Cheng</i>
<br>
<br>
This Letter unravels hydrogen bonding dynamics and their relationship with
supramolecular relaxations of monohydroxy alcohols (MAs) at intermediate times.
Rheological modulus of MAs exhibit Rouse scaling relaxation of G(t) ~ t^(-1/2)
switching to G(t) ~ t^(-1) at time tau_m before their terminal time. Meanwhile,
dielectric spectroscopy reveals clear signatures of new supramolecular dynamics
matching with tau_m from rheology. Interestingly, the characteristic time,
tau_m, follows an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence over exceptionally wide
temperatures and agrees well with the hydrogen bonding exchange time from
nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. These observations demonstrate the
presence of collective Rouse-like sub-chain motions and the active
chain-swapping of MAs at intermediate times. Moreover, detailed theoretical
analyses point out explicitly that the hydrogen bonding exchange truncates the
Rouse-type supramolecular dynamics and triggers the chain-swapping processes,
supporting a recently proposed living polymer model.

<h3>Complex motion of steerable vesicular robots filled with active  colloidal rods</h3>

While the collective motion of active particles has been studied extensively,
effective strategies to navigate particle swarms without external guidance
remain elusive. We introduce a method to control the trajectories of
two-dimensional swarms of active rod-like particles by confining the particles
to rigid bounding membranes (vesicles) with non-uniform curvature. We show that
the propelling agents spontaneously form clusters at the membrane wall and
collectively propel the vesicle, turning it into an active superstructure. To
further guide the motion of the superstructure, we add discontinuous features
to the rigid membrane boundary in the form of a kinked tip, which acts as a
steering component to direct the motion of the vesicle. We report that the
system's geometrical and material properties, such as the aspect ratio and
Peclet number of the active rods as well as the kink angle and flexibility of
the membrane, determine the stacking of active particles close to the kinked
confinement and induce a diverse set of dynamical behaviors of the
superstructure, including linear and circular motion both in the direction of,
and opposite to, the kink. From a systematic study of these various behaviors,
we design vesicles with switchable and reversible locomotions by tuning the
confinement parameters. The observed phenomena suggest a promising mechanism
for particle transportation and could be used as a basic element to navigate
active matter through complex and tortuous environments.

<h3>Elastic shakedown and roughness evolution in repeated elastic-plastic  contact</h3>

Surface roughness emerges naturally during mechanical removal of material,
fracture, chemical deposition, plastic deformation, indentation, and other
processes. Here, we use continuum simulations to show how roughness which is
neither Gaussian nor self-affine emerges from repeated elastic-plastic contact
of a rough and rigid surface on a flat elastic-plastic substrate. Roughness
profiles change with each contact cycle, but appear to approach a steady-state
long before the substrate stops deforming plastically and has hence
"shaken-down" elastically. We propose a simple dynamic collapse for the
emerging power-spectral density, which shows that the multi-scale nature of the
roughness is encoded in the first few indentations. In contrast to macroscopic
roughness parameters, roughness at small scales and the skewness of the height
distribution of the resulting roughness do not show a steady-state, with the
latter vanishing asymptotically with contact cycle.

<h3>$\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories with matter fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13083</a>
<br>
<i>Kaustubh Roy, Elio J. König</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the exotic phenomenology of certain quantum materials and recent
advances in programmable quantum emulators, we here study fermions and bosons
in $\mathbb Z_N$ lattice gauge theories. We introduce a family of exactly
soluble models, and characterize their orthogonal (semi-)metallic ground
states, the excitation spectrum, and the correlation functions. We further
study integrability breaking perturbations using an appropriately derived set
of Feynman diagrammatic rules and borrowing physics associated to Anderson's
orthogonality catastrophe. In the context of the ground states, we revisit
Luttinger's theorem following Oshikawa's flux insertion argument and
furthermore demonstrate the existence of a Luttinger surface of zeros in the
fermionic Green's function. Upon inclusion of perturbations, we address the
transition from the orthogonal metal to the normal state by condensation of
certain excitations in the gauge sectors, so-called ``$e$-particles''. We
furthermore discuss the effect of dynamics in the dual ``$m$-particle''
excitations, which ultimately leads to the formation of charge-neutral hadronic
$N$-particle bound states. We present analytical arguments for the most
important phases and estimates for phase boundaries of the model. Specifically,
and in sharp distinction to quasi-1D $\mathbb Z_N$ lattice gauge theories,
renormalization group arguments imply that the phase diagram does not include
an emergent deconfining $U(1)$ phase. Therefore, in regards to lattice QED
problems, $\mathbb Z_N$ quantum emulators with $N<\infty$ can at best be used
for approximate solutions at intermediate length scales.

<h3>Electronic Structure Prediction of Multi-million Atom Systems Through  Uncertainty Quantification Enabled Transfer Learning</h3>

<br>
The ground state electron density - obtainable using Kohn-Sham Density
Functional Theory (KS-DFT) simulations - contains a wealth of material
information, making its prediction via machine learning (ML) models attractive.
However, the computational expense of KS-DFT scales cubically with system size
which tends to stymie training data generation, making it difficult to develop
quantifiably accurate ML models that are applicable across many scales and
system configurations. Here, we address these fundamental challenges using
Bayesian neural networks and employ transfer learning to leverage the
multi-scale nature of the training data. Our ML models employ descriptors
involving simple scalar products, comprehensively sample system configurations
through thermalization, and quantify uncertainty in electron density
predictions. We show that our models incur significantly lower data generation
costs while allowing confident - and when verifiable, accurate - predictions
for a wide variety of bulk systems well beyond training, including systems with
defects, different alloy compositions, and at unprecedented, multi-million-atom
scales.

<h3>Magneto-optical anisotropies of 2D antiferromagnetic MPX$_3$ from first  principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13109" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13109</a>
<br>
<i>Miłosz Rybak, Paulo E. Faria Junior, Tomasz Woźniak, Paweł Scharoch, Jaroslav Fabian, Magdalena Birowska</i>
<br>
<br>
Here we systematically investigate the impact of the spin direction on the
electronic and optical properties of transition metal phosphorus
trichalcogenides (MPX$_3$, M=Mn, Ni, Fe; X=S, Se) exhibiting various
antiferromagnetic arrangement within the 2D limit. Our analysis based on the
density functional theory and versatile formalism of Bethe-Salpeter equation
reveals larger exciton binding energies for MPS$_3$ (up to 1.1 eV in air) than
MPSe$_3$(up to 0.8 eV in air), exceeding the values of transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). For the (Mn,Fe)PX$_3$ we determine the optically active
band edge transitions, revealing that they are sensitive to in-plane magnetic
order, irrespective of the type of chalcogen atom. We predict the anistropic
effective masses and the type of linear polarization as an important
fingerprints for sensing the type of magnetic AFM arrangements. Furthermore, we
identify the spin-orientation-dependent features such as the valley splitting,
the effective mass of holes, and the exciton binding energy. In particular, we
demonstrate that for MnPX$_3$ (X=S, Se) a pair of non equivalent K+ and K-
points exists yielding the valley splittings that strongly depend on the
direction of AFM aligned spins. Notably, for the out-of-plane direction of
spins, two distinct peaks are expected to be visible below the absorption
onset, whereas one peak should emerge for the in-plane configuration of spins.
These spin-dependent features provide an insight into spin flop transitions of
2D materials. Finally, we propose a strategy how the spin valley polarization
can be realized in 2D AFM within honeycomb lattice.

Computational materials are pivotal in advancing our understanding of
distinct material classes and their properties, offering valuable insights in
predicting novel structures and complementing experimental approaches. In this
context, Psi-graphene is a stable two-dimensional carbon allotrope composed of
5-6-7 carbon rings theoretically predicted recently. Using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, we explored its boron nitride counterpart's
mechanical, electronic, and optical characteristics (Psi-BN). Our results
indicate that Psi-BN possesses a band gap of 4.59 eV at the HSE06 level. Phonon
calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that
this material has excellent structural and dynamic stability. Moreover, its
formation energy is -7.48 eV. Psi-BN exhibited strong ultraviolet activity,
suggesting its potential as an efficient UV collector. Furthermore, we
determined critical mechanical properties of Psi-BN, such as the elastic
stiffness constants, Young's modulus (250-300 GPa), and Poisson ratio (0.7),
providing valuable insights into its mechanical behavior.

<h3>Thermal effect on microwave pulse driven magnetization switching of  Stoner particle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13124</a>
<br>
<i>S. Chowdhury, M. A. S. Akanda, M. A. J. Pikul, M.T. Islam, Tai Min</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently it has been demonstrated that the cosine chirp microwave pulse
(CCMP) is capable of achieving fast and energy-efficient magnetization-reversal
of a nanoparticle with zero-Temperature. However, we investigate the finite
temperature, $T$ effect on the CCMP-driven magnetization reversal using the
framework of the stochastic Landau Lifshitz Gilbert equation. At finite
Temperature, we obtain the CCMP-driven fast and energy-efficient reversal and
hence estimate the maximal temperature, $T_{max}$ at which the magnetization
reversal is valid. $T_{max}$ increases with increasing the nanoparticle
cross-sectional area/shape anisotropy up to a certain value, and afterward
$T_{max}$ decreases with the further increment of nanoparticle cross-sectional
area/shape anisotropy. This is because of demagnetization/shape anisotropy
field opposes the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, i.e., reduces the energy
barrier which separates the two stable states. For smaller cross-sectional
area/shape anisotropy, the controlling parameters of CCMP show decreasing trend
with temperature. We also find that with the increment easy-plane
shape-anisotropy, the required initial frequency of CCMP significantly reduces.
For the larger volume of nanoparticles, the parameters of CCMP remains constant
for a wide range of temperature which are desired for the device application.
Therefore, The above findings might be useful to realize the CCMP-driven fast
and energy-efficient magnetization reversal in realistic conditions.

<h3>Giant orbit-to-charge conversion induced via the inverse orbital Hall  effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the orbit-to-charge conversion in YIG/Pt/nonmagnetic material
(NM) trilayer heterostructures. With the additional Ru layer on the top of
YIG/Pt stacks, the charge current signal increases nearly an order of magnitude
in both longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (SSE) and spin pumping (SP)
measurements. Through thickness dependence studies of the Ru metal layer and
theoretical model, we quantitatively clarify different contributions of the
increased SSE signal that mainly comes from the inverse orbital Hall effect
(IOHE) of Ru, and partially comes from the orbital sink effect in the Ru layer.
A similar enhancement of SSE(SP) signals is also observed when Ru is replaced
by other materials (Ta, W, and Cu), implying the universality of the IOHE in
transition metals. Our findings not only suggest a more efficient generation of
the charge current via the orbital angular moment channel but also provides
crucial insights into the interplay among charge, spin, and orbit.

KTaO3 has recently attracted attention as a model system to study the
interplay of quantum paraelectricity, spin-orbit coupling, and
superconductivity. However, the high and low vapor pressures of potassium and
tantalum present processing challenges to creating interfaces clean enough to
reveal the intrinsic quantum properties. Here, we report superconducting
heterostructures based on electronic-grade epitaxial (111) KTaO3 thin films.
Electrical and structural characterizations reveal that two-dimensional
electron gas at the heterointerface between amorphous LaAlO3 and KTaO3 thin
film exhibits significantly higher electron mobility, superconducting
transition temperature and critical current density than those in bulk single
crystal KTaO3-based heterostructures owing to cleaner interface in KTaO3 thin
films. Our hybrid approach may enable epitaxial growth of other alkali
metal-based oxides that lie beyond the capabilities of conventional methods.

<br>
We consider the critical behavior associated with incommensurate
unidirectional charge-density-wave ordering in a weakly orthorhombic system
subject to uniaxial strain as an experimentally significant example of
$U(1)\times U(1)$ multicriticality. We show that, depending on microscopic
details, the phase diagram can have qualitatively different structures which
can involve a vestigial meta-nematic critical point, a pair of tricritical
points, a decoupled tetracritical point, or (at least at mean-field level) a
bicritical point. We analyze the emergent symmetries in the critical regime and
find that these can -- at least in some cases -- involve an emergent
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ order parameter symmetry.

<h3>Robust Luttinger liquid state of 1D Dirac fermions in a van der Waals  system Nb$_9$Si$_4$Te$_{18}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) behavior in fully degenerate
1D Dirac fermions. A ternary van der Waals material Nb$_9$Si$_4$Te$_{18}$
incorporates in-plane NbTe$_2$ chains, which produce a 1D Dirac band crossing
Fermi energy. Tunneling conductance of electrons confined within NbTe2 chains
is found to be substantially suppressed at Fermi energy, which follows a power
law with a universal temperature scaling, hallmarking a TLL state. The obtained
Luttinger parameter of ~0.15 indicates strong electron-electron interaction.
The TLL behavior is found to be robust against atomic-scale defects, which
might be related to the Dirac electron nature. These findings, as combined with
the tunability of the compound and the merit of a van der Waals material, offer
a robust, tunable, and integrable platform to exploit non-Fermi liquid physics.

<br>
<br>
The persistent quasi-planar nematic texture known also as the dowser texture
is characterized by a 2D unitary vector field d. We show here that the dowser
texture is sensitive, in first order, to electric fields. This property is due
to the flexo-electric polarisation P collinear with d expected from R.B.
Meyer's considerations on flexo-electricity in nematics. It is pointed out that
due to the flexo-electric polarisation nematic monopoles can be manipulated by
electric fields of appropriated geometry.

<h3>Giant atomic swirl in graphene bilayers with biaxial heterostrain</h3>

<br>
The study of moir\'e engineering started with the advent of van der Waals
heterostructures in which stacking two-dimensional layers with different
lattice constants leads to a moir\'e pattern controlling their electronic
properties. The field entered a new era when it was found that adjusting the
twist between two graphene layers led to strongly-correlated-electron physics
and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. Twist is now used
routinely to adjust the properties of two-dimensional materials. Here, we
investigate a new type of moir\'e superlattice in bilayer graphene when one
layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other - so-called biaxial
heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling
electronic states associated with a novel symmetry-breaking atomic
reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using
experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around
regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer.
Tight-binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the
observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required
by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important
parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir\'e engineering in van der
Waals multilayers.

\ We combine density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations to
investigate the impact of Sr concentration and atomic ordering on the
structural and ferroelectric properties of (Ba, Sr)TiO$_3$. On one hand, the
macroscopic structural properties are rather insensitive to atomic ordering. On
the other hand, the Curie temperature and polarization differ by $9$\% and
$17$\% for different symmetries of the Sr distribution, respectively. Local
ordering of Sr induces preferential polarization directions and influences the
relative stability of the three ferroelectric phases.

We examine the origin of the formation of narrow bands in LK-99
(Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O) and the parent compound without the Cu doping using
density functional theory calculations and model Hamiltonian studies. Explicit
analytical expressions are given for a nearest-neighbor tight-binding (TB)
Hamiltonian in the momentum space for both the parent and the LK-99 compound,
which can serve as an effective model to study various quantum phenomena
including superconductivity. The parent material is an insulator with the
buckle oxygen atom on the stacked triangular lattice forming the topmost bands,
well-separated from the remaining oxygen band manifold. The $C_3$
symmetry-driven two-band TB model describes these two bands quite well. These
bands survive in the Cu-doped, LK-99, though with drastically altered band
dispersion due to the Cu-O interaction. A similar two-band model involving the
Cu $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals broadly describes the top two valence bands of LK-99.
However, the band dispersions of both the Cu and O bands are much better
described by the four-band TB model incorporating the Cu-O interactions on the
buckled honeycomb lattice. We comment on the possible mechanisms of
superconductivity in LK-99. even though the actual T$_c$ may be much smaller
than reported, and suggest that interstitial Cu clusters leading to broad bands
might have a role to play

The puzzling question about the floating of the topological surface state on
top of a thick Pb layer, has now possibly been answered. A study of the
interface made by Pb on Bi2Se3 for different temperature and adsorbate coverage
condition, allowed us to demonstrate that the evidence reported in the
literature can be related to the surface diffusion phenomenon exhibited by the
Pb atoms, which leaves the substrate partially uncovered. Comprehensive density
functional theory calculations show that despite the specific arrangement of
the atoms at the interface, the topological surface state cannot float on top
of the adlayer but rather tends to move inward within the substrate.

$\mathrm{MoS_2}$ is an emergent van der Waals material that shows promising
prospects in semiconductor industry and optoelectronic applications. However,
its electronic properties are not yet fully understood. In particular, the
nature of the insulating state at low carrier density deserves further
investigation, as it is important for fundamental research and applications. In
this study, we investigate the insulating state of a dual-gated exfoliated
bilayer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ field-effect transistor by performing magnetotransport
experiments. We observe positive and non-saturating magnetoresistance, in a
regime where only one band contributes to electron transport. At low electron
density ($\sim 1.4\times 10^{12}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) and a perpendicular
magnetic field of 7 Tesla, the resistance exceeds by more than one order of
magnitude the zero field resistance and exponentially drops with increasing
temperature. We attribute this observation to strong electron localization.
Both temperature and magnetic field dependence can, at least qualitatively, be
described by the Efros-Shklovskii law, predicting the formation of a Coulomb
gap in the density of states due to Coulomb interactions. However, the
localization length obtained from fitting the temperature dependence exceeds by
more than one order of magnitude the one obtained from the magnetic field
dependence. We attribute this discrepancy to the presence of a nearby metallic
gate, which provides electrostatic screening and thus reduces long-range
Coulomb interactions. The result of our study suggests that the insulating
state of $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ originates from a combination of disorder-driven
electron localization and Coulomb interactions.

<br>

We study three aspects of work statistics in the context of the fluctuation
theorem for the quantum spin chains by numerical methods based on
matrix-product states. First, we elaborate that the work done on the spin-chain
by a sudden quench can be used to characterize the quantum phase transitions
(QPT). We further obtain the numerical results to demonstrate its capability of
characterizing the QPT of both Landau-Ginzbrug types, such as the Ising chain,
or topological types, such as the Haldane chain. Second, we propose to use the
fluctuation theorem, such as Jarzynski's equality, which relates the real-time
correlator to the ratio of the thermal partition functions, as a benchmark
indicator for the numerical real-time evolving methods. Third, we study the
passivity of ground and thermal states of quantum spin chains under some cyclic
impulse processes. We verify the passivity of thermal states. Furthermore, we
find that some ground states in the Ising-like chain, with less overall spin
order from spontaneous or explicit symmetry breaking, can be active so that
they can be exploited for quantum engines.

The weak disorder potential seen by the electrons of a two-dimensional
electron gas in high-mobility semiconductor heterostructures leads to
fluctuations in the physical properties and can be an issue for nanodevices. In
this paper, we show that a scanning gate microscopy (SGM) image contains
information about the disorder potential, and that a machine learning approach
based on SGM data can be used to determine the disorder. We reconstruct the
electric potential of a sample from its experimental SGM data and validate the
result through an estimate of its accuracy.

<br>
<br>
Thouless pumping represents a powerful concept to probe quantized topological
invariants in quantum systems. We explore this mechanism in a generalized
Rice-Mele Fermi-Hubbard model characterized by the presence of competing onsite
and intersite interactions. Contrary to recent experimental and theoretical
results, showing a breakdown of quantized pumping induced by the onsite
repulsion, we prove that sufficiently large intersite interactions allow for an
interaction-induced recovery of Thouless pumps. Our analysis further reveals
that the occurrence of stable topological transport at large interactions is
connected to the presence of a spontaneous bond-order-wave in the ground-state
phase diagram of the model. Finally, we discuss a concrete experimental setup
based on ultracold magnetic atoms in an optical lattice to realize the newly
introduced Thouless pump. Our results provide a new mechanism to stabilize
Thouless pumps in interacting quantum systems.

<h3>Pure measure of bending for soft plates</h3>

<br>
<i>Epifanio G. Virga</i>
<br>
<br>
This paper, originally motivated by a question raised by Wood and Hanna [Soft
Matter, 15, 2411 (2019)], shows that pure measures of bending for soft plates
can be defined by introducing the class of bending-neutral deformations, finite
incremental changes of the plate's shape bearing no further bending. This class
of deformations is subject to a geometric compatibility condition, which is
fully characterized. A tensorial pure measure of bending, which is accordingly
invariant under bending-neutral deformations, is described in details. The
general notion of pure measure of bending could be of use to formulate direct
theories for soft plates, were stretching and bending energies to be kept
separate.

<h3>Entanglement and absorbing state transitions in $(d+1)$-dimensional  stabilizer circuits</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the influence of feedback operations on the dynamics of
$(d+1)$-dimensional monitored random quantum circuit. Competition between
unitary dynamics and measurements leads to an entanglement phase transition,
while the feedback steers the dynamics towards an absorbing state, yielding an
absorbing state phase transition. Building on previous results in one spatial
dimension [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 120402 (2023)], we discuss the interplay
between the two types of transitions for $d \ge 2$ in the presence of (i)
short-range feedback operations or (ii) additional global control operations.
In both cases, the absorbing state transition belongs to the $d$-dimensional
directed percolation universality class. In contrast, the entanglement
transition depends on the feedback operation type and reveals the dynamics'
inequivalent features. The entanglement and absorbing state phase transition
remain separated for short-range feedback operations. When global control
operations are applied, we find the two critical points coinciding;
nevertheless, the universality class may still differ, depending on the choice
of the control operation.

<h3>Separation of interacting active particles in an asymmetric channel</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the diffusive behaviour of interacting active particles
(self-propelled) with mass $m$ in an asymmetric channel. The particles are
subjected to an external oscillatory force along the length of the channel. In
this setup, particles may exhibit rectification. In the absence of interaction,
the mean velocity $\langle v \rangle$ of the particles shows a maximum at
moderate $m$ values. It means that particles of moderate $m$ have higher
velocities than the others. However, by incorporating short-range interaction
between the particles, $\langle v \rangle$ exhibits an additional peak at lower
$m$ values, indicating that particles of lower and moderate m can be separated
simultaneously from the rest. Furthermore, by tuning the interaction strength,
the self-propelled velocity, and the parameters of the oscillatory force, one
can selectively separate the particles of lower $m$, moderate $m$, or both.
Empirical relations for estimating the optimal mass as a function of these
parameters are discussed. These findings are beneficial for separating the
particles of selective $m$ from the rest of the particles.

<h3>Geometric and conventional contributions to superfluid weight in the  minimal models for superconducting copper-doped lead apatite</h3>

<br>
<br>
The density functional theory calculations and tight-binding models for the
copper-doped lead apatite support flat bands, which could be susceptible to the
emergence of high-temperature superconductivity. We develop theory for the
geometric contribution of the superfluid weight arising from the momentum-space
topology of the Bloch wave functions of these flat bands, and we compare our
results to the paradigmatic case of $s$-wave superconductivity on an isolated
topological flat band. We show that, in contrast to the standard paradigm of
flat-band superconductivity, there does not exist any lower bound for the
superfluid weight in these models. Moreover, although the nontrivial quantum
geometries of the normal state bands are the same when the superconductivity
appears in the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, the emerging
superconducting phases have very different superfluid weights. In the case of
superconductivity appearing on the spin-polarized bands the superfluid weight
varies a lot as a function of model parameters. On the other hand, if the
superconductivity emerges in the paramagnetic phase the superfluid weight is
robustly large and it contains a significant geometric component.

<br>
<br>
Ionic liquids provide versatile pathways for controlling the structures and
properties of quantum materials. Previous studies have reported electrostatic
gating of nanometre-thick flakes leading to emergent superconductivity,
insertion or extraction of protons and oxygen ions in perovskite oxide films
enabling the control of different phases and material properties, and
intercalation of large-sized organic cations into layered crystals giving
access to tailored superconductivity. Here, we report an ionic-liquid gating
method to form three-dimensional transition metal monochalcogenides (TMMCs) by
driving the metals dissolved from layered transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) into the van der Waals gap. We demonstrate the successful
self-intercalation of PdTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$, turning them into high-quality
PdTe and NiTe single crystals, respectively. Moreover, the monochalcogenides
exhibit distinctive properties from dichalcogenides. For instance, the
self-intercalation of PdTe$_2$ leads to the emergence of superconductivity in
PdTe. Our work provides a synthesis pathway for TMMCs by means of ionic liquid
gating driven self-intercalation.

<h3>High-susceptibility nanoparticles for micro-inductor core materials</h3>

According to the laws of magnetism, the shape of magnetically soft objects
limits the effective susceptibility. For example, spherical soft magnets cannot
display an effective susceptibility larger than 3. Although true for
macroscopic multi-domain magnetic materials, we show that magnetic
nanoparticles in a single-domain state do not suffer from this limitation. This
is a consequence of the particle moment being forced to saturation by the
predominance of exchange forces, and only allowed to rotate coherently in
response to thermal and/or applied fields. We apply statistical mechanics to
determine the static and dynamic susceptibility of single-domain particles as a
function of size, temperature and material parameters. Our calculations reveal
that spherical single-domain particles with large saturation magnetisation and
small magneto-crystalline anisotropy, e.g. FeNi particles, can have very a
large susceptibility of 200 or more. We further show that susceptibility and
losses can be tuned by particle easy axis alignment with the applied field in
case of uniaxial anisotropy, but not for particles with cubic anisotropy. Our
model is validated experimentally by comparison with measurements on
nanocomposites containing spherical 11$\pm$3 nm $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ particles
up to 45 vol% finely dispersed in a polymer matrix. In agreement with the
calculations for this specific material, the measured susceptibility of the
composites is up to 17 ($\gg$3) and depends linearly on the volume fraction of
particles. Based on these results, we predict that nanocomposites of 30 vol% of
superparamagnetic FeNi particles in an insulating non-magnetic matrix can have
a sufficiently large susceptibility to be used as micro-inductor core materials
in the MHz frequency range, while maintaining losses below state-of-the-art
ferrites.

<h3>Coexistence of non-trivial van der Waals magnetic orders enable  field-free spin-orbit torque switching at room temperature</h3>

The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibiting non-trivial and
tunable magnetic interactions at room temperature can give rise to exotic
magnetic states, which are not readily attainable with conventional materials.
Such vdW magnets can provide a unique platform for studying new magnetic
phenomena and realising magnetization dynamics for energy-efficient and
non-volatile spintronic memory and logic technologies. Recent developments in
vdW magnets have revealed their potential to enable spin-orbit torque (SOT)
induced magnetization dynamics. However, the deterministic and field-free SOT
switching of vdW magnets at room temperature has been lacking, prohibiting
their potential applications. Here, we demonstrate magnetic field-free and
deterministic SOT switching of a vdW magnet (Co0.5Fe0.5)5GeTe2 (CFGT) at room
temperature, capitalizing on its non-trivial intrinsic magnetic ordering. We
discover a coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in CFGT at
room temperature, inducing an intrinsic exchange bias and canted perpendicular
magnetism. The resulting canted perpendicular magnetization of CFGT introduces
symmetry breaking, facilitating successful magnetic field-free magnetization
switching in the CFGT/Pt heterostructure devices. Furthermore, the SOT-induced
magnetization dynamics and their efficiency are evaluated using 2nd harmonic
Hall measurements. This advancement opens new avenues for investigating tunable
magnetic phenomena in vdW material heterostructures and realizing field-free
SOT-based spintronic technologies.

The high frequency collective dynamics of liquid hydrogen fluoride is studied
by inelastic x-ray scattering on the coexistence curve at T = 239 K. The
comparison with existing molecular dynamics simulations shows the existence of
two active relaxation processes with characteristic time scales in the
subpicosecond range. The observed scenario is very similar to that found in
liquid water. This suggests that hydrogen bonded liquids behave similarly to
other very different systems as simple and glass forming liquids, thus
indicating that these two relaxation processes are universal features of the
liquid state.

Light-mass bipolarons in off-diagonally coupled electron-phonon systems
provide a potential route to bipolaronic high-Tc superconductivity. While there
has been numerical progress in the physically relevant limit of slow phonons,
more insights are needed to fully understand to what extent this mechanism
survives at finite densities and in different regimes. We address these
questions using advanced tensor-network methods applied to the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Studying both the spectral properties of isolated
bipolarons as well as the pairing correlations at small finite densities, we
find evidence that the conventional picture of bipolarons as molecular bound
states which undergo Bose-Einstein condensation may need to be reconsidered.
Instead, our findings suggest correlation-driven formation of a fragmented
condensate with spatially separated polaron pairs, stabilized by strong
repulsive electron-electron interactions at moderate values of the
electron-phonon coupling. These spatially modulated charge clouds exhibit
pairing with a typical length-scale set by the Fermi momentum.

By using the self-consistent Born approximation, we investigate disorder
effect induced by short-range impurities on the band-gap of a seminal
two-dimensional (2D) system, whose phase diagram contains trivial,
single-band-inverted and double-band-inverted states. Following the
density-of-states (DOS) evolution, we demonstrate multiple closings and
openings of the band-gap with the increase of the disorder strength.
Calculations of the spectral function describing the quasiparticles at the
$\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone evidence that the observed band-gap
behavior is unambiguously caused by the topological phase transitions due to
the mutual inversions between the first and second electron-like and hole-like
subbands. We also find that an increase in the disorder strength in the
double-inverted state always leads to the band-gap closing due to the overlap
of the tails of DOS from conduction and valence subbands.

Among the performance-enhancing procedures for Hopfield-type networks that
implement associative memory, Hebbian Unlearning (or dreaming) strikes for its
simplicity and its clear biological interpretation. Yet, it does not easily
lend itself to a clear analytical understanding. Here we show how Hebbian
Unlearning can be effectively described in terms of a simple evolution of the
spectrum and the eigenvectors of the coupling matrix. We use these ideas to
design new dreaming algorithms that are effective from a computational point of
view, and are analytically far more transparent than the original scheme.

Electron spins confined in silicon quantum dots are promising candidates for
large-scale quantum computers. However, the degeneracy of the conduction band
of bulk silicon introduces additional levels dangerously close to the window of
computational energies, where the quantum information can leak. The energy of
the valley states - typically 0.1 meV - depends on hardly controllable
atomistic disorder and still constitutes a fundamental limit to the scalability
of these architectures. In this work, we introduce designs of CMOS-compatible
silicon fin field-effect transistors that enhance the energy gap to
non-computational states by more than one order of magnitude. Our devices
comprise realistic silicon-germanium nanostructures with a large shear strain,
where troublesome valley degrees of freedom are completely removed. The energy
of non-computational states is therefore not affected by unavoidable atomistic
disorder and can further be tuned in-situ by applied electric fields. Our
design ideas are directly applicable to a variety of setups and will offer a
blueprint towards silicon-based large-scale quantum processors.

Soft X-ray ptychography was employed to simultaneously image the
ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domains in an 80 nm thick freestanding
multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. The antiferromagnetic spin cycloid was resolved by
reconstructing the resonant elastic X-ray scattering and visualised together
with mosaic-like ferroelectric domains in a linear dichroic contrast image at
the Fe L$_3$ edge. The measurements reveal a near perfect coupling between the
magnetic and ferroelectric ordering by which the propagation direction of the
spin cycloid is locked orthogonally to the ferroelectric polarisation. The
results provide a direct visualisation of the strong magnetoelectric coupling
in BiFeO$_3$ and of its fine multiferroic domain structure, emphasising the
potential of high resolution ptychographic imaging in opening new possibilities
for the study of multiferroics and non-collinear magnetic materials with soft
X-rays.
