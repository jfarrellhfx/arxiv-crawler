<h3>Mechanochemical Topological Defects in an Active Nematic</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03796" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03796</a>

<i>Michael M. Norton, Piyush Grover</i>
<br>
We propose a reaction-diffusion system that converts topological information
of an active nematic into chemical signals. We show that a curvature-dependent
reaction dipole is sufficient for creating a system that dynamically senses
topology by producing a scalar order parameter possessing local extrema
coinciding with $\pm\frac{1}{2}$ defects. We consider two possible physical
origins of such dipoles: (i) curved molecules that preferentially bind to
nematic regions matching their curvature and (ii) nematic molecules that become
reaction dipoles when deformed. We demonstrate the behavior of this system for
stationary defects and in the presence of hydrodynamic flows as seen in active
nematics. The model can help generate testable hypotheses for biological
phenomena and motivate the creation of bioinspired materials that dynamically
couple nematic structure with biochemistry.

<h3>Simultaneous Critical Order-Disorder and Critical Phase Separation in  Compressible Polar Active Fluids: Dynamic and Functional Renormalization  Group Analyses</h3>

The collective phenomenon of swarming behavior can, in the hydrodynamic
limit, be described as a polar active fluid (PAF) - the same theory that
governs the behavior of a collection of self-propelling particles with
alignment interactions. Although a PAF is fundamentally out of equilibrium at
the microscopic level, it is unclear whether the macroscopic behavior reflects
this fact, e.g., through the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation
valid in equilibrium systems. In this work, we investigate the multicritical
point (MCP) of compressible PAFs, where the critical order-disorder transition
coincides with critical phase separation. We first study the critical
phenomenon using a dynamic renormalization group analysis and find that it is
insufficient since two-loop effects are important to obtain a nontrivial
correction to the scaling exponents. We then remedy this defect by using a
functional renormalization group analysis. We find three novel universality
classes and obtain their critical exponents, which we then use to show that at
least two of these universality classes are out of equilibrium because they
violate the fluctuation-dissipation relation.

<h3>Conformations and dynamics of active star polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04069</a>
<br>
<i>Prabha Chuphal, Vladimir V. Palyulin</i>
<br>
We study conformations and dynamics of active star polymers. The analysis
shows that active star polymers stretching behaviour is quite different from
that of active linear chains. The visual inspection of conformations and
bond-bond correlations reveal a better coordination for the alignment and
coordination of bonds for the star polymers than for the linear counterparts.
The architecture substantially affects the chain extension transition at high
values of active force. The scaling laws for the shape factor and the arm
asphericity ratio established for the passive star polymers coincide with the
passive case for active force values below the transition. For the values above
the transition range the scaling of these quantities switches to different
values.

<h3>Analytic Solution of an Active Brownian Particle in a Harmonic Well</h3>

<br>
<i>Michele Caraglio, Thomas Franosch</i>
<br>
We provide an analytical solution for the time-dependent Fokker-Planck
equation for a two-dimensional active Brownian particle trapped in an isotropic
harmonic potential. Using the passive Brownian particle as basis states we show
that the Fokker-Planck operator becomes lower diagonal, implying that the
eigenvalues are unaffected by the activity. The propagator is then expressed as
a combination of the equilibrium eigenstates with weights obeying exact
iterative relations. We show that for the low-order correlation functions, such
as the positional autocorrelation function, the recursion terminates at finite
order in the P\'eclet number allowing us to generate exact compact expressions
and derive the velocity autocorrelation function and the time-dependent
diffusion coefficient. The nonmonotonic behavior of latter quantities serves as
a fingerprint of the non-equilibrium dynamics.

<h3>Role of planar buckling on the electronic, thermal, and optical  properties of Germagraphene nanosheets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04247" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04247</a>
<br>
<i>Nzar Rauf Abdullah, Yousif Hussein Azeez, Botan Jawdat Abdullah, Hunar Omar Rashid, Andrei Manolescu, Vidar Gudmundsson</i>
<br>
We report the electronic, the thermal, and the optical properties of a
Germagraphene (GeC) monolayer taking into account buckling effects. The
relatively wide direct band gap of a flat GeC nanosheet can be changed by
tuning the planar buckling. A GeC monolayer has an sp$^2$ hybridization in
which the contribution of an $s$-orbital is half of the contribution of a
$p$-orbital leading to stronger $\sigma\text{-}\sigma$ bonds compared to the
$\sigma\text{-}\pi$ bonds. Increasing the planar buckling, the contribution of
an $s$-orbital is decreased while the contribution of a $p$-orbital is
increased resulting in a sp$^3$-hybridization in which the $\sigma\text{-}\pi$
bond becomes stronger than the $\sigma\text{-}\sigma$ bond. As a result, the
band gap of a buckled GeC is reduced and thus the thermal and the optical
properties are significantly modified. We find that the heat capacity of the
buckled GeC is decreased at low values of planar buckling, which is caused by
the anticrossing of the optical and the acoustic phonon modes affecting phonon
scattering processes. The resulting optical properties, such as the dielectric
function, the refractive index, the electron energy loss spectra, the
absorption, and the optical conductivity show that a buckled GeC nanosheet has
increased optical activities in the visible light region compared to a flat
GeC. The optical conductivity is red shifted from the near ultraviolet to the
visible light region, when the planar buckling is increased. We can thus
confirm that the buckling can be seen as another parameter to improve GeC
monolayers for optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Mechanism of Structural Colors in Binary Mixtures of Nanoparticle-based  Supraballs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04381" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04381</a>

<i>Christian M. Heil, Anvay Patil, Bram Vanthournout, Saranshu Singla, Markus Bleuel, Jing-Jin Song, Ziying Hu, Nathan C. Gianneschi, Matthew D. Shawkey, Sunil K. Sinha, Arthi Jayaraman, Ali Dhinojwala</i>
<br>
Inspired by structural colors in avian species, various synthetic strategies
have been developed to produce non-iridescent, saturated colors using
nanoparticle assemblies. Mixtures of nanoparticles varying in particle
chemistry (or complex refractive indices) and particle size have additional
emergent properties that impact the color produced. For such complex
multi-component systems, an understanding of assembled structure along with a
robust optical modeling tool can empower scientists to perform intensive
structure-color relationship studies and fabricate designer materials with
tailored color. Here, we demonstrate how we can reconstruct the assembled
structure from small-angle scattering measurements using the computational
reverse-engineering analysis for scattering experiments (CREASE) method and
then use the reconstructed structure in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
calculations to predict color. We successfully, quantitatively predict
experimentally observed color in mixtures containing strongly absorbing melanin
nanoparticles and demonstrate the influence of a single layer of segregated
nanoparticles on color produced. The versatile computational approach presented
in this work is useful for engineering synthetic materials with desired colors
without laborious trial and error experiments.

<h3>Superfluid Hydrodynamics of multi-component Bosonic systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04540" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04540</a>
<br>
<i>F. Zhang, L. Yin</i>
<br>
For a bosonic gas at zero temperature, the superfluid hydrodynamic equations
are usually derived from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which is valid in
the dilute region when the Bose-EinsteinCondensation dominates and the effects
beyond the mean-field are negligible. In systems such as liquid helium and
quantum droplets, this method is inapplicable. In this paper, we show generally
that the zero-temperature superfluid hydrodynamic equation of a multi-component
bosonic system with short-ranged interactions can be obtained in the
path-integral formalism under the local equilibrium assumption, which is even
valid beyond the dilute region. The superfluid hydrodynamic equations are
equivalent to the equation of motion of the superfluid order parameter. In
contrast, the GPE-type equations with the condensate wavefunctions as variables
are insufficient to completely describe the dynamics of quantum depletion. With
the Hartree energy treated properly, our approach can be extended to systems
with long-range interactions such as dipole-dipole interactions. The
implication of our results on quantum droplets is discussed.

<h3>Theory of broken symmetry quantum Hall states in the $N=1$ Landau level  of Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03752" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03752</a>
<br>
<i>Nikolaos Stefanidis, Inti Sodemann Villadiego</i>
<br>
We study many-body ground states for the partial integer fillings of the
$N=1$ Landau level in graphene, by constructing a model that accounts for the
lattice scale corrections to the Coulomb interactions. Interestingly, in
contrast to the $N=0$ Landau level, this model contains not only pure delta
function interactions but also some of its derivatives. Due to this we find
several important differences with respect to the $N=0$ Landau level. For
example at quarter filling when only a single component is filled, there is a
degeneracy lifting of the quantum hall ferromagnets and ground states with
entangled spin and valley degrees of freedom can become favourable. Moreover at
half-filling of the $N=1$ Landau level, we have found a new phase that is
absent in the $N=0$ Landau level, that combines characteristics of the
Kekul\'{e} state and an antiferromagnet. We also find that according to the
parameters extracted in a recent experiment, at half-filling of the $N=1$
Landau level graphene is expected to be in a delicate competition between an AF
and a CDW state, but we also discuss why the models for these recent
experiments might be missing some important terms.

<h3>Classical limit of measurement-induced transition in many-body chaos in  integrable and non-integrable oscillator chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03760" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03760</a>
<br>
<i>Sibaram Ruidas, Sumilan Banerjee</i>
<br>
We discuss the dynamics of integrable and non-integrable chains of coupled
oscillators under continuous weak position measurements in the semiclassical
limit. We show that, in this limit, the dynamics is described by a standard
stochastic Langevin equation, and a measurement-induced transition appears as a
noise- and dissipation-induced chaotic-to-non-chaotic transition akin to
stochastic synchronization. In the non-integrable chain of anharmonically
coupled oscillators, we show that the temporal growth and the ballistic
light-cone spread of a classical out-of-time correlator characterized by the
Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity, are halted above a noise or below
an interaction strength. The Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity both
act like order parameter, vanishing in the non-chaotic phase. In addition, the
butterfly velocity exhibits a critical finite size scaling. For the integrable
model we consider the classical Toda chain, and show that the Lyapunov exponent
changes non-monotonically with the noise strength, vanishing at the zero noise
limit and above a critical noise, with a maximum at an intermediate noise
strength. The butterfly velocity in the Toda chain shows a singular behaviour
approaching the integrable limit of zero noise strength.

<h3>Nonequilibrium criticality driven by Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations in  the synchronization of oscillator lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03782" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03782</a>
<br>
<i>Ricardo Gutiérrez, Rodolfo Cuerno</i>
<br>
The synchronization of oscillator ensembles is pervasive throughout nonlinear
science, from classical or quantum mechanics to biology, to human assemblies.
Traditionally, the main focus has been the identification of threshold
parameter values for the transition to synchronization and the nature of such
transition. Here, we show that considering an oscillator lattice as a discrete
growing interface provides unique insights into the dynamical process whereby
the lattice reaches synchronization for long times. Working on a generalization
of the celebrated Kuramoto model that allows for odd or non-odd couplings, we
elucidate synchronization of oscillator lattices as an instance of generic
scale invariance, whereby the system displays space-time criticality, largely
irrespective of parameter values. The critical properties of the system happen
to fall into universality classes of kinetically rough interfaces with columnar
disorder, namely, those of the Edwards-Wilkinson (equivalently, the Larkin
model of an elastic interface in a random medium) or the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
(KPZ) equations, for Kuramoto (odd) coupling and generic (non-odd) couplings,
respectively. From the point of view of kinetic roughening, the critical
properties we find turn out to be quite innovative, especially concerning the
statistics of the fluctuations as characterized by their probability
distribution function (PDF) and covariance. While the latter happens to be that
of the Larkin model irrespective of the symmetry of the coupling, in the
generic non-odd coupling case the PDF turns out to be the celebrated
Tracy-Widom distribution associated with the KPZ nonlinearity. This brings the
synchronization of oscillator lattices into a remarkably large class of
strongly-correlated, low-dimensional (classical and quantum) systems with
strong universal fluctuations.

<h3>Enhanced Magnetism in Heterostructures with Transition-Metal  Dichalcogenide Monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03817</a>
<br>
<i>Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, Ranjan Kumar Barik, Manh-Huong Phan, Lilia M. Woods</i>
<br>
Two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures have opened up new
possibilities for magnetism at the nanoscale. In this study, we utilize
first-principles simulations to investigate the structural, electronic, and
magnetic properties of $\textrm{Fe}/\textrm{WSe}_2/\textrm{Pt}$ systems
containing pristine, defective, or doped $\textrm{WSe}_2$ monolayers. The
proximity effects of the ferromagnetic Fe layer are studied by considering
defective and vanadium-doped $\textrm{WSe}_2$ monolayers. All heterostructures
are found to be ferromagnetic, and the insertion of the transition-metal
dichalcogenide results in a redistribution of spin orientation and an increased
density of magnetic atoms due to the magnetized $\textrm{WSe}_2$. There is an
increase in the overall total density of states at the Fermi level due to
$\textrm{WSe}_2$; however, the transition-metal dichalcogenide may lose its
distinct semiconducting properties due to the stronger than van der Waals
coupling. Spin-resolved electronic structure properties are linked to larger
spin Seebeck coefficients found in heterostructures with $\textrm{WSe}_2$
monolayers.

<h3>Experimental electronic structure of the electrically switchable  antiferromagnet CuMnAs</h3>

<br>
Tetragonal CuMnAs is a room temperature antiferromagnet with an electrically
reorientable N\'eel vector and a Dirac semimetal candidate. Direct measurements
of the electronic structure of single-crystalline thin films of tetragonal
CuMnAs using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) are reported,
including Fermi surfaces (FS) and energy-wavevector dispersions. After
correcting for a chemical potential shift of $\approx-390$ meV (hole doping),
there is excellent agreement of FS, orbital character of bands, and Fermi
velocities between the experiment and density functional theory calculations.
Additionally, 2x1 surface reconstructions are found in the low energy electron
diffraction (LEED) and ARPES. This work underscores the need to control the
chemical potential in tetragonal CuMnAs to enable the exploration and
exploitation of the Dirac fermions with tunable masses, which are predicted to
be above the chemical potential in the present samples.

<h3>Schottky Electric Field Induced Circular Photogalvanic Effect in Cd3As2  Nanobelts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03819</a>
<br>
<i>Bob Minyu Wang, Yuqing Zhu, Henry Clark Travaglini, Sergey Y. Savrasov, Dong Yu</i>
<br>
Dirac semimetals are expected to forbid the manifestation of the circular
photogalvanic effect (CPGE) because of their crystal inversion symmetry. Here,
we report the observation of the CPGE in Cd3As2 nanobelt field effect
transistors, when the photoexcitation is focused in the vicinity of the metal
contacts up to room temperature. We attribute the CPGE to the Schottky electric
field induced symmetry breaking, which results in the photocurrent modulation
by circularly polarized photoexcitation via spin-momentum locking. The
hypothesis is supported by a suite of experiments including spatially and
angularly resolved helicity dependent photocurrent, Kelvin probe force
microscopy, and gate voltage dependence. First principles calculations
confirmed a topological phase transition upon field induced structural
distortion. This work provides key insights on the electrically controlled
helicity dependent optoelectronics in Dirac materials.

<h3>Many-body quantum chaos in stroboscopically-driven cold atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03840" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03840</a>
<br>
<i>Ceren B. Dag, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Amos Chan, Hossein R. Sadeghpour</i>
<br>
Seeking signatures of quantum chaos in experimentally realizable many-body
systems is of vigorous interest. In such systems, the spectral form factor
(SFF), defined as the Fourier transform of two-level spectral correlation
function, is known to exhibit random matrix theory (RMT) behaviors, namely a
'ramp' followed by a 'plateau' in sufficiently late time. Recently, a generic
early-time deviation from the RMT behavior, which we call the 'bump', has been
shown to exist in random quantum circuits and spin chains as toy models for
many-body quantum chaotic systems. Here we demonstrate the existence of the
'bump-ramp-plateau' behavior in the SFF for a number of paradigmatic,
stroboscopically-driven cold atom models of interacting bosons in optical
lattices and spinor condensates. We find that the scaling of the many-body
Thouless time $t_{\text{Th}}$ -- the time of the onset of the (RMT) ramp
behavior -- and the increase of the bump amplitude in atom number are
significantly slower in (effectively 0D) chaotic spinor gases than in 1D
optical lattices, demonstrating the role of locality in many-body quantum
chaos. Moreover, $t_{\text{Th}}$ scaling and the bump amplitude are more
sensitive to variations in atom number than the system size regardless of the
hyperfine structure, the symmetry classes, or the choice of the driving
protocol. We obtain scaling functions of SFF which suggest power-law behavior
for the bump regime in quantum chaotic cold-atom systems. Finally, we propose
an interference measurement protocol to probe SFF in the laboratory.

<h3>Breakdown of topological protection due to non-magnetic edge disorder in  two-dimensional materials in the Quantum Spin Hall phase</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03846" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03846</a>
<br>
<i>Leandro R. F. Lima, Caio Lewenkopf</i>
<br>
We study the suppression of the conductance quantization in quantum spin Hall
systems by a combined effect of electronic interactions and edge disorder, that
is ubiquitous in exfoliated and CVD grown 2D materials. We show that the
interplay between the electronic localized states due to edge defects and
electron-electron interactions gives rise to local magnetic moments, that break
time-reversal symmetry and the topological protection of the edge states in 2D
topological systems. Our results suggest that edge disorder leads to small
deviations of a perfect quantized conductance in short samples and to a strong
conductance suppression in long ones. Our analysis is based on on the Kane-Mele
model, an unrestricted Hubbard mean field Hamiltonian and on a self-consistent
recursive Green's functions technique to calculate the transport quantities.

<h3>One Analytical Approach of Rashba-Edelstein Magnetoresistance in 2D  Materials</h3>

<i>Wibson W. G. Silva, José Holanda</i>
<br>
We study analytically the Rashba-Edelstein magnetoresistance (REMR) in a
structure made from an insulator ferromagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet
(YIG), and a 2D material (2DM) with direct and inverse Rashba-Edelstein
effects, such as SLG and MoS$_2$. Our results represent an efficient way of
analyzing the Rashba-Edelstein effects.

<h3>Valence and magnetism in $\rm EuPd_3S_4$ and $\rm  (Y,La)_xEu_{1-x}Pd_3S_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03860</a>
<br>
<i>D. H. Ryan, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Brinda Kuthanazhi, Paul C. Canfield</i>
<br>
$^{151}$Eu M\"ossbauer spectroscopy shows that yttrium substitution in
mixed-valent $\rm EuPd_3S_4$ drives the initial 50:50 mix of Eu$^{3+}$ and
Eu$^{2+}$ towards pure Eu$^{2+}$, whereas lanthanum substitution has the
opposite effect, but only for substitution levels above 50\%. We find that
total valence electron count and chemical pressure effects cannot account for
the observed behaviour, however conserving the cell volume provides a
consistent description of the changes in the Eu$^{2+}$:Eu$^{3+}$ ratio.
Remarkably, lanthanum substitution also leads to a clear transition from static
mixed-valent behavior at lower temperatures to dynamic mixed valent behavior at
higher temperatures, with the onset temperature monotonically increasing with
Eu content and extrapolating to a value of $\sim$340~K for the pure $\rm
EuPd_3S_4$ compound. Magnetic order persists at least as far as x=0.875 in both
series, despite the drastic reduction in the amount of moment-carrying
Eu$^{2+}$ ions.

<h3>Comprehensive Demonstration of Spin-Hall Hanle Effects in Epitaxial Pt  Thin Films</h3>

<br>
<i>Jing Li, Andrew H. Comstock, Dali Sun, Xiaoshan Xu</i>
<br>
We demonstrate a nonlinear Hall effect due to the boundary spin accumulation
in Pt films grown on Al2O3 substrates. This Hall effect and the previously
demonstrated Hanle magnetoresistance provide a complete picture of the
spin-precession control of the spin and charge transport at the boundary of a
spin-orbit coupled material, which we refer to as spin-Hall Hanle effects
(SHHE). We also show that the SHHE can be employed to measure the spin
diffusion length, the spin-Hall angle, and the spin relaxation time of heavy
metal without the need of magnetic interface or the input from other
measurements. The comprehensive demonstration of SHHE in such a simple system
suggests they may be ubiquitous and needs to be considered for unravelling the
spin and charge transport in more complex thin film structures of spin-orbit
coupled materials.

The precession of a ferromagnet leads to the injection of spin current and
heat into an adjacent non-magnetic material. Besides, spin-orbit entanglement
causes an additional charge current injection. Such a device has been recently
proposed where a quantum-spin hall insulator (QSHI) in proximity to a
ferromagnetic insulator (FI) and superconductor (SC) leads to the pumping of
charge, spin, and heat. Here we build a circuit-compatible Verilog-A-based
compact model for the QSHI-FI-SC device capable of generating two topologically
robust modes enabling the device operation. Our model also captures the
dependence on the ferromagnetic precision, drain voltage, and temperature with
an excellent (> 99%) accuracy.

<h3>Renormalization formalism for superconducting phase transition with  inner-Cooper-pair dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03889</a>
<br>

<br>
As charge carrier of the macroscopic superconductivity, the Cooper pair is a
composite particle of two paired electrons, which has both center-of-mass and
inner-pair degrees of freedom. In most cases, these two different degrees of
freedom can be well described by the macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau theory and the
microscopic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, respectively. Near the
superconducting phase transition where the Cooper pair is fragile and unstable
because of the small binding energy, there are non-trivial couplings between
these two different degrees of freedom due to such as finite energy and/or
momentum transfer. The non-trivial couplings make the original derivation of
the Ginzburg-Landau theory from the BCS theory fail in principle as where these
two different degrees of freedom should not be decoupled. In this manuscript,
we will present a renormalization formalism for an extended Ginzburg-Landau
action for the superconducting phase transition where there is finite energy
transfer between the center-of-mass and the inner-pair degrees of freedom of
Cooper pairs. This formalism will provide a theoretical tool to study the
unusual effects of the inner-pair time-retarded physics on the superconducting
phase transition.

<h3>Theory of Optical Activity in Doped Systems with Application to Twisted  Bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03960</a>
<br>

<br>
We theoretically study the optical activity in a doped system and derive the
optical activity tensor from a light wavevector-dependent linear optical
conductivity. Although the light-matter interaction is introduced through the
velocity gauge from a minimal coupling Hamiltonian, we find that the well-known
``false divergences'' problem can be avoided in practice if the electronic
states are described by a finite band effective Hamiltonian, such as a few-band
tight-binding model. The expression we obtain for the optical activity tensor
is in good numerical agreement with a recent theory derived for an undoped
topologically trivial gapped system. We apply our theory to the optical
activity of a gated twisted bilayer graphene, with a detailed discussion of the
dependence of the results on twist angle, chemical potential, gate voltage, and
location of rotation center forming the twisted bilayer graphene.

<h3>Imaginary-time Quantum Relaxation Critical Dynamics with Semi-ordered  Initial States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03979" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03979</a>
<br>
<i>Zhi-Xuan Li, Yu-Rong Shu, Shuai Yin</i>
<br>
We explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics near quantum critical
points with semi-ordered initial states. Different from the case with
homogeneous ordered initial state, in which the order parameter $M$ decays
homogeneously as $M\propto \tau^{-\beta/\nu z}$, here $M$ depends on the
location $x$, showing rich scaling behaviors. Similar to the classical Model A
critical dynamics with an initial domain wall, here as the imaginary time
evolves, the domain wall expands into an interfacial region with growing size.
In the interfacial region, the local order parameter decays as $M\propto
\tau^{-\beta_1/\nu z}$, with $\beta_1$ being an additional dynamic critical
exponent. Far away from the interfacial region the local order parameter decays
as $M\propto \tau^{-\beta/\nu z}$ in the short-time stage, then crosses over to
the scaling behavior of $M\propto \tau^{-\beta_1/\nu z}$ when the location $x$
is absorbed in the interfacial region. A full scaling form characterizing these
scaling properties is developed. The quantum Ising model in both one and two
dimensions are taken as examples to verify the scaling theory. In addition, we
find that for the quantum Ising model the scaling function is an analytical
function and $\beta_1$ is not an independent exponent.

Here, by making use of medium and high resolution autocorrected off-axis
electron holography, we directly probe the electrostatic potential as well as
in-plane and out-of-plane charge delocalization at edges and steps in
multilayer hexagonal boron nitride. In combination with ab-initio calculations,
the data allows to directly reveal the formation of out-of-plane covalent bonds
at folded zig-zag edges and steps comprising two monolayers and the absence of
which at monolayer steps. The technique paves the way for studying other charge
(de)localization phenomena in 2D materials, e.g., at polar edges, topological
edge states and defects.

<h3>Charge order and emergent symmetries in cuprate superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04046" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04046</a>
<br>
<i>C. Pépin, H. Freire</i>
<br>
In this paper, we review our studies of the phase diagram of the cuprate
superconductors performed in recent years. We describe how a few
field-theoretical concepts can be used to account for the puzzling properties
of these compounds. Starting with a short exposition of recent experimental
developments, we then introduce the concept of an emergent SU(2) symmetry,
which rotates between the superconducting and charge order parameters. We
describe a solvable model for which this symmetry turns out to be exact and
derive the corresponding effective field theory in terms of a non-linear
$\sigma$ model. We then turn to the experimental consequences of our model with
the presence of skyrmions inside the vortex core and an elegant account of the
$B$-$T$ phase diagram. Next, we move on to the second concept, which is the one
of an emergent U(1) gauge field in the theory. Within this more general
framework, the pseudogap transition can be viewed as a confining/deconfining
transition. Experimental consequences for a few spectroscopic probes like
inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, phonon line in x-ray
scattering and ARPES measurements are studied. This theory suggests the
presence of incoherent bosons at high temperature in the phase diagram of the
cuprates, which would undergo a jamming transition at optimal doping.
Consequences of the presence of such bosons on the transport properties of
these materials are examined.

<h3>Finite-dimensional signature of spinodal instability in an athermal  hysteretic transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04057</a>
<br>
<i>Anurag Banerjee, Tapas Bar</i>
<br>
We study the off-equilibrium critical phenomena across a hysteretic
first-order transition in disordered athermal systems. The study focuses on the
zero temperature random field Ising model (ZTRFIM) above the critical disorder
for spatial dimensions $d=2,3,$ and $4$. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show
that disorder suppresses critical slowing down in phase ordering time for
finite-dimensional systems. The dynamic hysteresis scaling, the measure of
explicit finite-time scaling, is used to subsequently quantify the critical
slowing down. The scaling exponents in all dimensions increase with disorder
strength and finally reach a stable value where the transformation is no longer
critical. The associated critical behavior in the mean-field limit is very
different, where the exponent values for various disorders in all dimensions
are similar. The non-mean-field exponents asymptotically approach the
mean-field value ($\Upsilon \approx 2/3$) with increase in dimensions. The
results suggest that the critical features in the hysteretic metastable phase
are controlled by inherent mean-field spinodal instability that gets blurred by
disorder in low-dimension athermal systems.

<h3>Dynamical quantum phase transitions in SYK Lindbladians</h3>

<br>
<i>Kohei Kawabata, Anish Kulkarni, Jiachen Li, Tokiro Numasawa, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<br>
We study the open quantum dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model
described by the Lindblad master equation, where the SYK model is coupled to
Markovian reservoirs with jump operators that are either linear or quadratic in
the Majorana fermion operators. Of particular interest for us is the time
evolution of the dissipative form factor, which quantifies the average overlap
between the initial and time-evolved density matrices as an open quantum
generalization of the Loschmidt echo. We find that the dissipative form factor
exhibits dynamical quantum phase transitions. We analytically demonstrate a
discontinuous dynamical phase transition in the limit of large number of
fermion flavors, which is formally akin to the thermal phase transition in the
two-coupled SYK model between the black-hole and wormhole phases. We also find
continuous dynamical phase transitions that do not have counterparts in the
two-coupled SYK model. Furthermore, we numerically show that signatures of the
dynamical quantum phase transitions remain to appear even in the finite number
of fermion flavors.

<h3>Creation of Chiral Interface Channels for Quantized Transport in  Magnetic Topological Insulator Multilayer Heterostructures</h3>

<i>Yi-Fan Zhao, Ruoxi Zhang, Jiaqi Cai, Deyi Zhuo, Ling-Jie Zhou, Zi-Jie Yan, Moses H. W. Chan, Xiaodong Xu, Cui-Zu Chang</i>
<br>
One-dimensional (1D) topologically protected states are usually formed at the
interface between two-dimensional (2D) materials with different topological
invariants. Therefore, 1D chiral interface channels (CICs) can be created at
the boundary of two quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with different
Chern numbers. Such a QAH junction can function as a chiral edge current
distributer at zero magnetic field, but its realization remains challenging.
Here, by employing an in-situ mechanical mask, we use molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) to synthesize QAH insulator junctions, in which two QAH insulators with
different Chern numbers are connected along a 1D junction. For the junction
between C = 1 and C = -1 QAH insulators, we observe quantized transport and
demonstrate the appearance of the two parallel propagating CICs along the
magnetic domain wall at zero magnetic field. Moreover, since the Chern number
of the QAH insulators in magnetic topological insulator (TI)/TI multilayers can
be tuned by altering magnetic TI/TI bilayer periods, the junction between two
QAH insulators with arbitrary Chern numbers can be achieved by growing
different periods of magnetic TI/TI on the two sides of the sample. For the
junction between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH insulators, our quantized transport shows
that a single CIC appears at the interface. Our work lays down the foundation
for the development of QAH insulator-based electronic and spintronic devices,
topological chiral networks, and topological quantum computations.

<h3>Origin of negative electrocaloric effect in Pnma-type antiferroelectric  perovskites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04138</a>
<br>
<i>Ningbo Fan, Jorge Íñiguez, L. Bellaiche, Bin Xu</i>
<br>
Anomalous electrocaloric effect (ECE) with decreasing temperature upon
application of an electric field is known to occur in antiferroelectrics
(AFEs), and previous understanding refers to the field-induced canting of
electric dipoles if there is no phase transitions. Here, we use a
first-principle-based method to study the ECE in Nd-substituted BiFeO3 (BNFO)
perovskite solid solutions, which has the Pnma-type AFE ground state. We
demonstrate another scenario to achieve and explain anomalous ECE, emphasizing
that explicit consideration of octahedral tiltings is indispensable for a
correct understanding. This mechanism may be general for AFEs for which the
antipolar mode is not the primary order parameter. We also find that the
negative ECE can reach a large magnitude in BNFO.

<br>
The combination with superconductivity and topological nontrivial band
structure provides a promising route towards novel quantum states such as
topological superconductivity. Here, we report the first observation of
superconductivity (4.1 K) in Ba5In4Bi5 single crystal, a noncentrosymmetric
topological semimetal featuring nodal chain loops at the high-symmetry points R
and X. The magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat capacity measurements
reveal that Ba5In4Bi5 is a moderately coupled type-II Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
superconductor. Bulk superconductivity is suggested from the magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat measurements. The results show that Ba5In4Bi5
provides a new platform for exploring the relationship of superconductivity and
topological nontrivial band topology.

<h3>Particle and thermal transport through one dimensional topological  systems via Lindblad formalism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04163" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04163</a>
<br>
<i>Yan He, Chih-Chun Chien</i>
<br>
We apply the Lindblad quantum master equation to two examples of
one-dimensional topological systems, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and
Kitaev chain, to study their particle and thermal transport. The steady-state
properties are obtained by decomposing fermions into Majorana fermions and
extracting their correlation functions. We focus on the particle and thermal
currents flowing through the bulk when the system is driven by two reservoirs
coupled to the two ends. The ratio of the currents of the SSH model from the
topological and trivial regimes with the same bandwidth demonstrates
suppression of transport due to the edge states, which couple to the reservoirs
but do not participate in transport. A similar comparison cannot be performed
for the Kitaev chain because the topological and trivial regimes have different
bandwidths, and the edge states are less significant away from the transition.
Therefore, the results contrast various topological properties in quantum
transport.

<h3>Robust analytic continuation of Green's functions via projection, pole  estimation, and semidefinite relaxation</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhen Huang, Emanuel Gull, Lin Lin</i>
<br>
Green's functions of fermions are described by matrix-valued
Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions. Since analytic continuation is fundamentally an
ill-posed problem, the causal space described by the matrix-valued
Herglotz-Nevanlinna structure can be instrumental in improving the accuracy and
in enhancing the robustness with respect to noise. We demonstrate a
three-pronged procedure for robust analytic continuation called PES: (1)
Projection of data to the causal space. (2) Estimation of pole locations. (3)
Semidefinite relaxation within the causal space. We compare the performance of
PES with the recently developed Nevanlinna and Carath\'{e}odory continuation
methods and find that PES is more robust in the presence of noise and does not
require the usage of extended precision arithmetics. We also demonstrate that a
causal projection improves the performance of the Nevanlinna and
Carath\'{e}odory methods. The PES method is generalized to bosonic response
functions, for which the Nevanlinna and Carath\'{e}odory continuation methods
have not yet been developed. It is particularly useful for studying spectra
with sharp features, as they occur in the study of molecules and band
structures in solids.

<br>
<i>Alexander Osinsky, Nikolay Brilliantov</i>
<br>
We report a number of exact solutions for temperature-dependent Smoluchowski
equations. These equations quantify the ballistic agglomeration, where the
evolution of densities of agglomerates of different size is entangled with the
evolution of the mean kinetic energy (partial temperatures) of such clusters.
The obtained exact solutions may be used as a benchmark to assess the accuracy
and computational efficiency of the numerical approaches, developed to solve
the temperature-dependent Smoluchowski equations. Moreover, they may also
illustrate the possible evolution regimes in these systems. The exact solutions
have been obtained for a series of model rate coefficients, and we demonstrate
that there may be an infinite number of such model coefficient which allow
exact analysis. We compare our exact solutions with the numerical solutions for
various evolution regimes; an excellent agreement between numerical and exact
results proves the accuracy of the exploited numerical method.

<h3>Local entropy and nonextensivity of networks ensembles</h3>

<i>Qi Zhang, Meizhu Li</i>
<br>
Nonextensivity is foreseeable in network ensembles, as heterogeneous
interactions generally exist in complex networked systems that need to be
described by network ensembles. But this nonextensivity has not been
literatured proved yet. In this work, the existence of nonextensivity in the
binary and weighted network ensembles is theoretically proved for the first
time (both in the microcanonical and canonical ensemble) based on the finding
of the local entropy's nonlinear change when new nodes are added to the network
ensembles. This proof also shows that the existence of nonextensivity is the
main difference between the network ensembles and other traditional models in
statistical physics (Ising model).

<h3>High-performance non-Fermi-liquid metallic thermoelectric materials</h3>

<br>
Searching for high-performance thermoelectric (TE) materials in the paradigm
of narrow-bandgap semiconductors has lasted for nearly 70 years and is
obviously hampered by a bottleneck of research now. Here we report on the
discovery of a few metallic compounds, TiFexCu2x-1Sb and TiFe1.33Sb, showing
the thermopower exceeding many TE semiconductors and the dimensionless figure
of merits comparable with the state-of-the-art TE materials. A quasi-linear
temperature (T) dependence of electrical resistivity in 2 K - 700 K and the
logarithmic T-dependent electronic specific heat at low temperature are also
observed to coexist with the high thermopower, highlighting the strong
intercoupling of the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) quantum critical behavior of
electrons with TE transports. Electronic structure analysis reveals the
existence of fluctuating Fe-eg-related local magnetic moments, Fe-Fe
antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction at the nearest 4c-4d sites, and two-fold
degenerate eg orbitals antiferromagnetically coupled with the dual-type
itinerant electrons close to the Fermi level, all of which infer to a
competition between the AFM ordering and Kondo-like spin compensation as well
as a parallel two-channel Kondo effect. These effects are both strongly
meditated by the structural disorder due to the random filling of Fe/Cu at the
equivalent 4c/4d sites of the Heusler crystal lattice. The magnetic
susceptibility deviates from ideal antiferromagnetism but can be fitted well by
x(T) = 1/({\theta} + BT{\alpha}), seemingly being consistent with the quantum
critical scenario of strong local correlation as discussed before. Our work not
only breaks the dilemma that the promising TE materials should be heavily-doped
semiconductors, but also demonstrates the correlation among high TE
performance, NFL quantum criticality, and magnetic fluctuation, which opens up
new directions for future research.

From crystal chemistry rationale and density functional DFT calculations,
novel tetragonal carbon C5 is proposed as simplest ultrahard allotrope with
mixed hybrid carbon hybridizations (sp2 - sp3). Novel pentacarbon is identified
as cohesive and stable both dynamically and mechanically. Whereas charge
density is localized about tetrahedral C-sp3, it is found delocalized around
trigonal C-sp2 resulting in metallic behavior. The anisotropic structure
characteristics caused by the aligned trigonal carbon along the tetragonal
c-axis provide high Vickers hardness with a magnitude close to diamond

<br>
Recent discovery of the time reversal symmetry breaking magnetic Weyl
semimetals has created a huge surge of activities in the field of quantum
topological materials. In this work, we have studied systematically the ground
state magnetic order, electronic structure and the interplay between the
magnetic order and band topology in one such materials, EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$ (EMB)
and its Ca doped variant using first principles method within the framework of
density functional theory (DFT). The detailed investigation unravels the
existence of different topological phases in this single material which can be
tuned by an external probe such as magnetic field or chemical substitution. Our
DFT calculations including Coulomb correlation (U) and spin-orbit (SO)
interaction within GGA+U+SO approximation confirms that the magnetic ground
state of EMB is A-type Antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) with Eu magnetic moments
aligned along the crystallographic $a$ or $b$ direction. Although the ground
state of EMB is A-AFM, the Ferromagnetic (FM) state lies very close in energy.
We observe a single pair of Weyl points connecting valence and conduction band
very close to the Fermi level (FL) along $\Gamma$-A direction in the FM state
of EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$ with Eu moments aligned along crystallographic $c$ direction.
On doping 50\% Ca at Eu sites, we observe single pair of Weyl points moving
closer to the FL which is highly desirable for application purposes. Further we
observe that the separation between the Weyl points in the pair decreases in
doped compound compared to that in the parent compound which has direct
consequence on anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Our first principles
calculation of AHC shows high peak values exactly at these Weyl points and the
peak height decreases when we dope the system with Ca. Therefore, Ca doping can
be a good external handle to tune AHC in this system.

<br>
The Ising model is of prime importance in the field of statistical mechanics.
Here we show that Ising-type interactions can be realized in
periodically-driven circuits of stochastic binary resistors with memory. A key
feature of our realization is the simultaneous co-existence of ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic interactions between two neighboring spins -- an
extraordinary property not available in nature. We demonstrate that the
statistics of circuit states may perfectly match the ones found in the Ising
model with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions, and, importantly,
the corresponding Ising model parameters can be extracted from the
probabilities of circuit states. Using this finding, the Ising Hamiltonian is
re-constructed in several model cases, and it is shown that different types of
interaction can be realized in circuits of stochastic memristors.

<h3>Caution on Gross-Neveu criticality with a single Dirac cone: Violation  of locality and its consequence of unexpected finite-temperature transition</h3>

<br>
Lately there are many SLAC fermion investigations on the (2+1)D Gross-Neveu
criticality of a single Dirac cone [1,2]. While the SLAC fermion construction
indeed gives rise to the linear energy-momentum relation for all lattice
momenta at the non-interacting limit, the long-range hopping and its consequent
violation of locality on the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point (GN-QCP) --
which a priori requires short-range interaction -- has not been verified. Here
we show, by means of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the
interaction-driven antiferromagnetic insulator in this case is fundamentally
different from that on a purely local $\pi$-flux Hubbard model on the square
lattice. In particular, we find the antiferromagnetic long-range order in the
SLAC fermion model has a finite temperature continuous phase transition, which
violates the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and smoothly connects to the previously
determined GN-QCP. The magnetic excitations inside the antiferromagnetic
insulator are gapped without Goldstone mode, even though the state
spontaneously breaks continuous $SU(2)$ symmetry. These unusual results
proclaim caution on the interpretation of the quantum phase transition in SLAC
fermion model as that of GN-QCP with short-range interaction.

Squeezing of the quadratures of the electromagnetic field has been
extensively studied in optics and microwaves. However, previous works focused
on the generation of squeezed states in a low impedance ($Z_0 \approx 50
\Omega$) environment. We report here on the demonstration of the squeezing of
bosonic edge magnetoplasmon modes in a quantum Hall conductor whose
characteristic impedance is set by the quantum of resistance ($R_K \approx 25 k
\Omega$), offering the possibility of an enhanced coupling to low-dimensional
quantum conductors. By applying a combination of dc and ac drives to a quantum
point contact, we demonstrate squeezing and observe a noise reduction 18\%
below the vacuum fluctuations. This level of squeezing can be improved by using
more complex conductors, such as ac driven quantum dots or mesoscopic
capacitors.

The relativistic continuity equations for the extensive thermodynamic
quantities are derived based on the divergence theorem in Minkowski space
outlined by St\"uckelberg. This covariant approach leads to a relativistic
formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The internal energy
density and the pressure of a relativistic perfect fluid carry inertia, which
leads to a relativistic coupling between heat and work. The relativistic
continuity equation for the relativistic inertia is derived. The relativistic
corrections in the Euler equation and in the continuity equations for the
energy and momentum are identified. This relativistic theoretical framework
allows a rigorous derivation of the relativistic transformation laws for the
temperature, the pressure and the chemical potential based on the relativistic
transformation laws for the energy density, the entropy density, the mass
density and the number density.

<h3>Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations</h3>

<br>
The Onsager reciprocal relations are established within the phenomenological
framework of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. In order to do so,
the dissipated power densities associated to scalar and vectorial processes are
written as positive semi-definite quadratic forms of the corresponding
generalised forces, as required by the local expression of the second law in
the neighbourhood of the equilibrium. The antisymmetric part of the scalar and
vectorial Onsager matrices do not contribute to the dissipation, which yields
the scalar and vectorial Onsager reciprocal relations. Furthermore, the
positive semi-definite quadratic forms of the generalised scalar and vectorial
forces are invariant under time reversal, which yields the scalar and vectorial
Casimir-Onsager reciprocal relations, that are a generalisation of the Onsager
reciprocal relations.

<br>
We report magnetic optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) polarimetry and
imaging on Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, which allows direct visualization of the
mesoscopic antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure of a parent cuprate. Temperature-
and magnetic-field-dependent SHG reveals large domains with 90$^{\circ}$
relative orientations that are stabilized by a combination of uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy and the Earth's magnetic field. Below a temperature $T_R$ $\sim$ 97
K, we observe an unusual 90$^{\circ}$ spin reorientation transition, possibly
driven by competing magnetic anisotropies of the two copper sublattices, which
swaps the AFM domain states while preserving the domain structure. This allows
deterministic switching of the AFM states by thermal or laser heating. Near
$T_R$, the domain walls become exceptionally responsive to an applied magnetic
field, with the Earth's field sufficient to completely expel them from the
crystal. Our findings unlock opportunities to study the mesoscopic AFM behavior
of parent cuprates and explore their potential for AFM technologies.

We optimize a numerical time-stabilization routine for the phase-field
crystal (PFC) models of solidification. By numerical experiments, we showcase
that our approach can improve the accuracy of underlying time integration
schemes by a few orders of magnitude. We investigate different time integration
schemes. Moreover, as a prototypical example for applications, we extend our
numerical approach to a PFC model of solidification with an explicit
temperature coupling.

Random motion in disordered media is sensitive to the presence of obstacles
which prevent atoms, molecules, and other particles from moving freely in
space. When obstacles are static, a sharp transition between confined motion
and free diffusion occurs at a critical obstacle density: the percolation
threshold. Surprisingly, this conventional wisdom breaks in the presence of
simple interactions. To show this, we introduce the Sokoban random walk which
-- akin to the protagonist of an eponymous video game -- has some limited
ability to push away obstacles that block its path. While one expects that this
added capacity would allow the walk to venture further away, we find that this
is only true above the percolation threshold. Indeed, we show that the Sokoban
always confines itself to a finite region whose mean size is uniquely
determined by the initial obstacle density. The observed relation obeys an
equation that we derive based on a conservative rule for the onset of
confinement and by accounting for the emergent fractal nature of Sokoban
trajectories. Our findings depart markedly from the ruling "ant in a labyrinth"
paradigm, and vividly illustrate that even weak and localized particle-media
interactions cannot be neglected when coming to understand transport phenomena.

<br>
By means of enhanced Monte Carlo numerical simulations parallelized on GPU's
we study the critical properties of the spin-glass-like model for the
mode-locked glassy random laser, a $4$-spin model with complex spins with a
global spherical constraint and quenched random interactions. Using two
different boundary conditions for the mode frequencies we identify the critical
points and the critical indices of the random lasing phase transition using ,
with finite size scaling techniques. The outcome of the scaling analysis is
that the mode-locked random laser is in a mean-field universality class, though
different from the mean-field class of the Random Energy Model and the glassy
random laser in the narrow band approximation, that is, the fully connected
version of the present model. The low temperature (high pumping) phase is
finally characterized by means of the overlap distribution and evidence for the
onset of replica symmetry breaking in the lasing regime is provided.

<br>
Strong adhesives rely on reduced stress concentrations, often obtained via
specific geometry or composition of materials. In many examples in nature and
engineering prototypes, the adhesive performance relies on structural rigidity
being placed in specific locations. A few design principles have been
formulated, based on parametric optimization, while a general design tool is
still missing. We propose to use topology optimization to achieve optimal
stiffness distribution in a multi-material adhesive backing layer, reducing
stress concentration at specified locations. The method involves the
minimization of a linear combination of J-integral and strain energy. While the
J-integral minimization is aimed at reducing stress concentration, we observe
that the combination of these two objectives ultimately provides the best
results. We analyze three cases in plane strain conditions, namely (i)
double-edged crack and (ii) center crack in tension and (iii) edge crack under
shear. Each case evidences a different optimal topology with (i) and (ii)
providing similar results. The optimal topology allocates stiffness in regions
that are far away from the crack tip, intuitively, but the allocation of softer
materials over stiffer ones can be non-trivial. To test our solutions, we plot
the contact stress distribution across the interface. In all observed cases, we
eliminate the stress singularity at the crack tip. Stress concentrations might
arise in locations far away from the crack tip, but the final results are
independent of crack size. Our method ultimately provides optimal, flaw
tolerant, adhesives where the crack location is known.

<h3>Minimum critical velocity of a Gaussian obstacle in a Bose-Einstein  condensate</h3>

<br>
When a superfluid flows past an obstacle, quantized vortices can be created
in the wake above a certain critical velocity. In the experiment by W. J. Kwon
et al. [Phys. Rev. A 91, 053615 (2015)], the critical velocity $v_c$ was
measured for atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) using a moving repulsive
Gaussian potential and $v_c$ was minimized when the potential height $V_0$ of
the obstacle was close to the condensate chemical potential $\mu$. Here we
numerically investigate the evolution of the critical vortex shedding in a
two-dimensional BEC with increasing $V_0$ and show that the minimum $v_c$ at
the critical strength $V_{0c}\approx \mu$ results from the local density
reduction and vortex pinning effect of the repulsive obstacle. The spatial
distribution of the superflow around the moving obstacle just below $v_c$ is
examined. The particle density at the tip of the obstacle decreases as $V_0$
increases to $V_{c0}$ and at the critical strength, a vortex dipole is suddenly
formed and dragged by the moving obstacle, indicating the onset of vortex
pinning. The minimum $v_c$ exhibits power-law scaling with the obstacle size
$\sigma$ as $v_c\sim \sigma^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma\approx 1/2$.

<h3>Andreev processes in mesoscopic multi-terminal graphene Josephson  junctions</h3>

<br>
There is growing interest in using multi-terminal Josephson junctions (MTJJs)
as a platform to artificially emulate topological phases and to investigate
complex superconducting mechanisms such as quartet and multiplet Cooper
pairings. Current experimental signatures in MTJJs have led to conflicting
interpretations of the salient features. In this work, we report a
collaborative experimental and theoretical investigation of graphene-based
four-terminal Josephson junctions. We observe resonant features in the
differential resistance maps that resemble those ascribed to multiplet Cooper
pairings. To understand these features, we model our junctions using a circuit
network of coupled two-terminal resistively and capacitively shunted junctions
(RCSJs). Under appropriate bias current, the model predicts that a current
flowing between two diagonal terminals in a four-terminal geometry may be
represented as a sinusoidal function of a weighted sum of the superconducting
phases. We show that starting from a semi-classical model with diffusive
current-phase relations, the MTJJ effectively emulates a general form of the
expected current-phase relation for multiplet Cooper pairings. Our study
therefore suggests that differential resistance measurements alone are
insufficient to conclusively distinguish resonant Andreev reflection processes
from semi-classical circuit-network effects.

<br>
We carried out simulations of crystal truncation rod (CTR) scatterings, i.e.,
one of the surface X-ray diffraction techniques with atomic resolution, from a
monolayer He film adsorbed on graphite. Our simulations reveal that the 00L rod
scatterings from the He monolayer exhibit notable intensity modifications for
those from a graphite surface in the ranges of approximately L = 0.6 - 1.7 and
L = 2.2 - 3.5. The height of the He monolayer from the graphite surface largely
affects the CTR scattering profiles, indicating that CTR scatterings have
enough sensitivities to determine the surface structure of the various phases
in the He layer. In particular, in the incommensurate solid phase, our
preliminary experimental data show the intensity modulations that are expected
from the present simulations.

<br>
The non-Bloch band theory can describe energy bands in a one-dimensional (1D)
non-Hermitian system. On the other hand, whether the non-Bloch band theory can
be extended to higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems is nontrivial. In this
work, we construct the non-Bloch band theory in two classes of two-dimensional
non-Hermitian systems, by reducing the problem to that for a 1D non-Hermitian
model. In these classes of systems, we get the generalized Brillouin zone for
complex wave vectors and investigate topological properties. In the model of
the non-Hermitian Chern insulator, as an example, we show the bulk-edge
correspondence between the Chern number defined from the generalized Brillouin
zone and the appearance of the edge states.

<h3>Fractional and scaled Brownian motion on the sphere: The effects of  long-time correlations on navigation strategies</h3>

<br>
<i>Adriano Valdés Gómez, Francisco J. Sevilla</i>
<br>
We analyze long-time correlated Brownian motion and scaled Brownian motion on
the surface of the two dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. Due to the
geometric effects induced by the $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ curvature, such correlations
collude with specific dynamics (\emph{navigation strategies}) on the manifold
topology to originate rich transport properties. We focus our study to two
classes of navigation strategies: One induced by the specific set of
coordinates chosen for $\mathbb{S}^2$ which defines a fixed frame of reference;
in particular, we chose the basis induced by spherical coordinates. We find
that contrary to what occurs in the absence of correlations non-equilibrium
stationary distributions are attained. We elucidate an analogy of our results
with those observed of fractional Brownian motion in confined by reflecting
walls in one and two dimensions. In contrast, when the navigation strategy
chosen corresponds to a frame of reference moving with the particle as does the
Frenet-Serret system, then the equilibrium uniform distribution on the sphere
is attained. In both cases, the relaxation times towards the stationary
distribution depend on the particular value of the Hurst parameter. We show
that scaled Brownian motion on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is independent of the navigation
strategy and we find a good agreement between the analytical calculations
obtained from the solution of a time-dependent diffusion equation on
$\mathbb{S}^{2}$ and the numerical results obtained from our method to generate
ensemble of trajectories.

To overcome current serious energy and environmental issues, photocatalytic
water splitting holds great promise because it requires only solar energy as an
energy input to produce hydrogen. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors and
heterostructures possess several inherent advantages which are more suitable
for boosting solar energy than their bulk counterparts. In this work, by
performing high-throughput first-principles calculations combined with a
semiempirical van der Waals dispersion correction, we first provided the
periodic table of band alignment type for van der Waals heterostructures when
packing any two of the 260 semiconductor monolayers obtained from our 2D
semiconductor database (2DSdb) (https://materialsdb.cn/2dsdb/index.html). Based
on the rules of thumb for photocatalytic water splitting, we have further
screened dozens of potential semiconductors and thousands of heterostructures
which are promising for photocatalytic water splitting. The resulting database
would provide a useful guidance for experimentalists to design suitable 2D
vdWHs and photocatalysts according to desired applications.

<h3>Scientific Machine Learning for Modeling and Simulating Complex Fluids</h3>

The formulation of rheological constitutive equations -- models that relate
internal stresses and deformations in complex fluids -- is a critical step in
the engineering of systems involving soft materials. While data-driven models
provide accessible alternatives to expensive first-principles models and less
accurate empirical models in many engineering disciplines, the development of
similar models for complex fluids has lagged. The diversity of techniques for
characterizing non-Newtonian fluid dynamics creates a challenge for classical
machine learning approaches, which require uniformly structured training data.
Consequently, early machine learning constitutive equations have not been
portable between different deformation protocols or mechanical observables.
Here, we present a data-driven framework that resolves such issues, allowing
rheologists to construct learnable models that incorporate essential physical
information, while remaining agnostic to details regarding particular
experimental protocols or flow kinematics. These scientific machine learning
models incorporate a universal approximator within a materially objective
tensorial constitutive framework. By construction, these models respect
physical constraints, such as frame-invariance and tensor symmetry, required by
continuum mechanics. We demonstrate that this framework facilitates the rapid
discovery of accurate constitutive equations from limited data, and that the
learned models may be used to describe more kinematically complex flows. This
inherent flexibility admits the application of these 'digital fluid twins' to a
range of material systems and engineering problems. We illustrate this
flexibility by deploying a trained model within a multidimensional
computational fluid dynamics simulation -- a task that is not achievable using
any previously developed data-driven rheological equation of state.

<h3>Enumerating Stable Nanopores in Graphene and their Geometrical  Properties Using the Combinatorics of Hexagonal Lattices</h3>

<br>
Nanopores in two-dimensional (2D) materials, including graphene, can be used
for a variety of applications, such as gas separations, water desalination, and
DNA sequencing. So far, however, all plausible isomeric shapes of graphene
nanopores have not been enumerated. Instead, a probabilistic approach has been
followed to predict nanopore shapes in 2D materials, due to the exponential
increase in the number of nanopores as the size of the vacancy increases. For
example, there are 12 possible isomers when N=6 atoms are removed, a number
that theoretically increases to 11.7 million when N=20 atoms are removed from
the graphene lattice. The development of a smaller, exhaustive dataset of
stable nanopore shapes can help future experimental and theoretical studies
focused on using nanoporous 2D materials in various applications. In this work,
we use the theory of 2D triangular "lattice animals" to create a library of all
stable graphene nanopore shapes based on a modification of a well-known
algorithm in the mathematical combinatorics of polyforms known as Redelmeier's
algorithm. We show that there exists a correspondence between graphene
nanopores and triangular polyforms (called polyiamonds) as well as hexagonal
polyforms (called polyhexes). We develop the concept of a polyiamond ID to
identify unique nanopore isomers. We also use concepts from polyiamond and
polyhex geometry to eliminate unstable nanopores containing dangling atoms,
bonds, and moieties. The exclusion of such unstable nanopores leads to a
remarkable reduction in the possible nanopores from 11.7 million for N=20 to
only 0.184 million nanopores, thereby indicating that the number of stable
nanopores is almost two orders of magnitude lower and is much more tractable.
Not only that, by extracting the polyhex outline, our algorithm allows
searching for nanopores with dimensions and shape factors in a specified range.

<h3>Theoretical investigation of the role of the organic cation in  methylammonium lead iodide perovskite using a different method</h3>

The hybrid halide perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ is easy to manufacture and
inexpensive. Despite these, its efficiency as a solar cell is comparable to
today's efficient solar cells. For these reasons, it is attracting a lot of
attention today. However, the effects of the CH$_3$NH$_3^+$ (MA) molecule in
the perovskite structure on the electronic and structural properties are still
a matter of debate. Previous studies have generally focused on the rotation of
the MA molecule. In this study, from a different perspective, the effects of
the movement of the MA molecule along the C-N axis are investigated. With this
method, the effects of the MA molecule were examined in a more controlled way.
In this study, density functional theory (DFT) that accounts for van der Waals
(vdW) interactions was used in the calculations for the cases. The data
obtained in this study show that the location of the MA molecule in the initial
structures used in the calculations based on DFT is important. According to the
data obtained, H-I ionic bonds are formed between the MA molecule and the
inorganic framework. Within the structure, the H-I bond length tends to be
preserved, although the position of the MA changes. In this mechanism, the I
ion plays an important role by moving away from its place in the Pb-I-Pb
alignment. The position of the I ion determines the nature of the band gap
transition. Another effect is on the value of the band gap. Depending on the
position of the I ion, the band gap may narrow by about 0.26 eV. The separation
of the I ion from the Pb-I-Pb alignment by the effect of the MA molecule breaks
the inverse symmetry. The change in the nature of the band gap transition with
the broken inverse symmetry and the presence of heavy ions supports the
existence of the Rashba-type effect.

We study from first principles the magnetic, electronic, orbital and
structural properties of the LaMnO3 doped with gallium replacing the Mn-site.
The gallium doping reduces the Jahn-Teller effect, and consequently the
bandgap. Surprisingly, the system does not go towards a metallic phase because
of the Mn-bandwidth reduction. The Ga-doping tends to reduce the orbital order
typical of bulk antiferromagnetic LaMnO3 and consequently weakens the
antiferromagnetic phase. The Ga-doping favors the G-type orbital order and
layered-ordered ferromagnetic perovskite at x=0.50, both effects contribute to
the formation of the insulating ferromagnetic phase in LaMn1-xGaxO3.

Superconducting weak link (WL), acting as a Josephson junction (JJ), is one
of the widely used elements in superconductor science and quantum circuits. A
hysteretic JJ with robust switching between its superconducting and resistive
state is an excellent candidate for single-photon detection. However, the
ubiquitous fluctuations in the junction strongly influence the stability of the
states and, thus, the transition from one to the other. Here, we present an
experimental study of switching statistics of critical and retrapping currents
of a JJ based on niobium WL in its hysteretic regime. The mean lifetimes of the
two metastable states, namely, the zero-voltage superconducting state and
finite-voltage resistive state, are estimated from the distributions. Further,
close to the hysteresis crossover temperature, observed telegraphic noise in
the time domain due to random switching between the states provides their
lifetimes directly. We present a thermal model introducing a double-well
(bistable) feature with an intriguing quantity with respect to the devices'
temperature states. The effects of temperature fluctuations on the stability of
the states are shown. We discuss our results toward further improvement of the
efficiency of superconducting WL or nanowire single-photon detectors.

The spin of an electron confined in semiconductor quantum dots is currently a
promising candidate for quantum bit (qubit) implementations. Taking advantage
of existing CMOS integration technologies, such devices can offer a platform
for large scale quantum computation. However, a quantum mechanical framework
bridging a device's physical design and operational parameters to the qubit
energy space is lacking. Furthermore, the spin to charge coupling introduced by
intrinsic or induced Spin-Orbit-Interaction (SOI) exposes the qubits to charge
noise compromising their coherence properties and inducing quantum gate errors.
We present here a co-modelling framework for double quantum dot (DQD) devices
and their charge noise environment. We use a combination of an electrostatic
potential solver, full configuration interaction quantum mechanical methods and
two-level-fluctuator models to study the quantum gate performance in realistic
device designs and operation conditions. We utilize the developed models
together alongside the single electron solutions of the quantum dots to
simulate one- and two- qubit gates in the presence of charge noise. We find an
inverse correlation between quantum gate errors and quantum dot confinement
frequencies. We calculate X-gate fidelities >97% in the simulated Si-MOS
devices at a typical TLF densities. We also find that exchange driven two-qubit
SWAP gates show higher sensitivity to charge noise with fidelities down to 91%
in the presence of the same density of TLFs. We further investigate the one-
and two- qubit gate fidelities at different TLF densities. We find that given
the small size of the quantum dots, sensitivity of a quantum gate to the
distance between the noise sources and the quantum dot creates a strong
variability in the quantum gate fidelities which can compromise the device
yields in scaled qubit technologies.

<i>Constantino Sánchez Romero, Vicente Garzó</i>
<br>
The Boltzmann equation for $d$-dimensional inelastic Maxwell models is
considered to determine the collisional moments of second, third and fourth
degree in a granular binary mixture. These collisional moments are exactly
evaluated in terms of the velocity moments of the distribution function of each
species when diffusion is absent (mass flux of each species vanishes). The
corresponding associated eigenvalues as well as cross coefficients are obtained
as functions of the coefficients of normal restitution and the parameters of
the mixture (masses, diameters and composition). The results are applied to the
analysis of the time evolution of the moments (scaled with a thermal speed) in
the homogeneous cooling state problem. It is shown that, for given values of
the parameters of the system, the third and fourth degree moments could diverge
in time. An exhaustive study on the influence of the parameter space of the
mixture on the above singularity is carried out. The present work extends to
binary mixtures previous theoretical results derived for \emph{monocomponent}
inelastic Maxwell models [V. Garz\'o and A. Santos, Third and fourth degree
collisional moments for inelastic Maxwell models, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40

Folding protein dynamics has been an area of high interest for quite some
time, especially given the increased focus on the field of Biophysics. Because
folding dynamics occur on such short time scales, empirical techniques
developed for more "static" protein events, such as X-ray crystallography,
nuclear magnetic resonance, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) labelling,
aren't as applicable. Instead, computational methods must often be used to
simulate these short lived yet highly dynamic events. One such computational
method that is proven to provide much valuable insight into protein folding
dynamics is Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MD Simulation). This simulation
method is both highly computationally demanding, yet highly accurate in its
modelling of a proteins physical behaviour. Besides MD Simulation, simulations
in general are quite applicable in the context of these protein events. For
example, the simple Gillespie algorithm, a computational technique which can be
executed on almost any personal computer, provides quite the robust view into
protein dynamics given its computational simplicity. This paper will compare
the results of two simulations, an MD simulation of a disordered, six-residue,
carcinogenic protein fragment, and a Gillespie algorithm based simulation of an
ordered folding protein: the mathematically identical nature of the Gillespie
algorithm time series of the asymptotically stochastic hyperbolic tangent
dynamics for the wild type predicting the exact behaviour of the carcinogenic
protein system time series will show the computational power simulations
provide for analyzing both disordered and ordered protein systems.

We consider two-dimensional superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor
junctions and investigate the subgap modes along the junction interface. The
subgap modes exhibit characteristics similar to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states
that originate form the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism
in the magnetic junction. The dispersion relation of the subgap modes shows
qualitatively different profiles depending on the transport state (metallic,
half-metallic, or insulating) of the ferromagnet. As the spin splitting in the
ferromagnet is increased, the subgap modes bring about a $0$-$\pi$ transition
in the Josephson current across the junction, with the Josephson current
density depending strongly on the momentum along the junction interface (i.e.,
the direction of the incident current). For clean superconductor-ferromagnet
interfaces (i.e., strong coupling between superconductors and ferromagnet), the
subgap modes develop flat quasi-particle bands that allow to engineer the wave
functions of the subgap modes along an inhomogeneous magnetic junction.

<h3>Time Reversed States in Barrier Tunneling</h3>

<i>Kanchan Meena, P. Singha Deo</i>
<br>
Tunneling, though a physical reality, is shrouded in mystery. Wave packets
cannot be constructed under the barrier and group velocity cannot be defined.
The tunneling particle can be observed on either sides of the barrier but its
properties under the barrier has never been probed due to several problems
related to quantum measurement. We show that there are ways to bypass these
problems in mesoscopic systems and one can even derive an expression for the
quantum mechanical current under the barrier. A general scheme is developed to
derive this expression for any arbitrary system. One can use mesoscopic
phenomenon to subject the expression to several theoretical and experimental
cross checks. For demonstration we consider an ideal 1D quantum ring with
Aharonov-Bohm flux $\Phi$, connected to a reservoir. It gives clear evidence
that propagation occur under the barrier resulting in a current that can be
measured non-invasively and theoretically cross checked. Time reversed states
play a role but there is no evidence of violation of causality. The evanescent
states are known to be largely stable and robust against phase fluctuations
making them a possible candidate for device applications and so formalizing
current under barrier is important.

We discuss different properties and the ability of several topological
invariants based on position operators to identify phase transitions, and
compare with more accurate methods, like crossing of excited energy levels and
jumps in Berry phases. The invariants have the form $\text{Im} \text{ln}
\left\langle \exp \left[ i(2\pi /L)\Sigma _{j}x_{j} \left( m_{_{\uparrow
}}\hat{n}_{j\uparrow } +m_{\downarrow }\hat{n}_{j\downarrow }\right) \right]
\right\rangle $, where $L$ is the length of the system, $x_{j}$ the position of
the site $j$, $\hat{n}_{j\sigma }$ the operator of the number of particles at
site $j$ with spin $\sigma$. We show that $m_{\sigma }$ should be integers, and
in some cases of magnitude larger than 1 to lead to well defined expectation
values. For the interacting Rice-Mele model (which contains the interacting
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ionic Hubbard model as specific cases), we show
that three different invariants give complementary information and are
necessary and sufficient to construct the phase diagrams in the regions where
the invariants are protected by inversion symmetry. We also discuss the
consequences for pumping of charge and spin, and the effect of an Ising
spin-spin interaction or a staggered magnetic field.

<br>
Electronic and stability properties of quasi-2D alkylammonium perovskites are
investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and validated
experimentally on selected classes of compounds. Our analysis is focused on
perovskite structures of formula (A)$_2$(A$'$)$_{n-1}$Pb$_n$X$_{3n+1}$, with
large cations A = butyl-, pentyl-, hexylammonium (BA, PA, HXA), small cations
A$'$ = methylammonium, formamidinium, ethylammonium, guanidinium (MA,FA,EA,GA)
and halogens X = I, Br, Cl. The role of the halogen ions is outlined for the
band structure, stability and defect formation energies. Two opposing trends
are found for the absorption efficiency versus stability, the latter being
assessed with respect to possible degradation mechanisms. Experimental
validation is performed on quasi-2D perovskites based on pentylammonium
cations, namely: (PA)$_2$PbX$_4$ and (PA)$_2$(MA)Pb$_2$X$_7$, synthesized by
antisolvent-assisted vapor crystallization. Structural and optical analysis are
inline with the DFT based calculations. In addition, the thermogravimetric
analysis shows an enhanced stability of bromide and chloride based compounds,
in agreement with the theoretical predictions.

<br>
Control on spatial location and density of defects in 2D materials can be
achieved using electron beam irradiation. Conversely, ultralow accelerating
voltages (less than or equal to 5kV) are used to measure surface morphology,
with no expected defect creation. We find clear signatures of defect creation
in monolayer (ML) MoS2 at these voltages. Evolution of E' and A1' Raman modes
with electron dose, and appearance of defect activated peaks indicate defect
formation. To simulate Raman spectra of MoS2 at realistic defect distributions,
while retaining density-functional theory accuracy, we combine machine-learning
force fields for phonons and eigenmode projection approach for Raman tensors.
Simulated spectra agree with experiments, with sulphur vacancies as suggested
defects. We decouple defects, doping and carbonaceous contamination using
control (hBN covered and encapsulated MoS2) samples. We observe cryogenic PL
quenching and defect peaks, and find that carbonaceous contamination does not
affect defect creation. These studies have applications in photonics and
quantum emitters.

<h3>Charge distribution and spin textures in magic-angle twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04670" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04670</a>
<br>
<i>A.O. Sboychakov, A.V. Rozhkov, A.L. Rakhmanov</i>
<br>
We examine the coexisting spin and charge density waves as a possible ground
state of the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. When interactions are not
included, the spectrum of the material has 4 (8 if spin is taken into account)
almost flat almost degenerate bands. Interactions break down the degeneracy
forming an order parameter which is usually assumed to be a spin density wave
with a preset spin structure. Here we take into account a possible charge
density wave contribution to the order parameter, that is, inhomogeneous
distribution of the charge density within a twisted graphene supercell. We also
calculate self-consistently the spin structure of the order parameter. We find
that the density wave order is stable in the whole doping range from $-4$ to
$+4$ extra electrons per supercell. The spin texture changes from collinear at
zero doping to almost coplanar at finite doping. The density wave order shows
nematic distortion when we dope the system. We demonstrate that the local spin
magnetization is much stronger than the charge density variation, unless the
doping exceeds $3$ extra electrons or holes per supercell.

<h3>Population spiking and bursting in next generation neural masses with  spike-frequency adaptation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04673" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04673</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Ferrara, David Angulo-Garcia, Alessandro Torcini, Simona Olmi</i>
<br>
Spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) is a fundamental neuronal mechanism taking
into account the fatigue due to spike emissions and the consequent reduction of
the firing activity. We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on
the macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic
integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying
post-synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population
activities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next
generation neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the
derivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible
macroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled
neural masses. In single populations SFA favours the emergence of population
bursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for
inhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of
adaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken
symmetry: namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase
population spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new
collective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among
the fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from
anti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting
phenomena. The analysis of these CFC rhythms in the $\theta$-$\gamma$ range has
revealed that a reduction of SFA leads to an increase of the $\theta$ frequency
joined to a decrease of the $\gamma$ one. This is analogous to what reported
experimentally for the hippocampus and the olfactory cortex of rodents under
cholinergic modulation, that is known to reduce SFA.

<h3>Simulations of magnetic Bragg scattering in transmission electron  microscopy</h3>

<br>
We have simulated the magnetic Bragg scattering in transmission electron
microscopy in two antiferromagnetic compounds, NiO and LaMnAsO. This weak
magnetic phenomenon was observed in NiO experimentally by Loudon. We have
computationally reproduced Loudon's experimental data, and for comparison we
have performed calculations for the LaMnAsO compound as a more challenging
case, containing lower concentration of magnetic elements and strongly
scattering heavier non-magnetic elements. We have also described thickness and
voltage dependence of the intensity of the antiferromagnetic Bragg spot for
both compounds. We have employed two computational approaches, one assuming a
static lattice with Debye-Waller smeared potentials, and another explicitly
considering the atomic vibrations within the quantum excitations of phonons
model (thermal diffuse scattering). The structural analysis shows that the
antiferromagnetic Bragg spot appears in between (111) and (000) reflections for
NiO, while for LaMnAsO the antiferromagnetic Bragg spot appears at the position
of the (110) reflection in the diffraction pattern, which corresponds to a
forbidden reflection of the crystal structure. Calculations predict that the
intensity of the magnetic Bragg spot in NiO is significantly stronger than
thermal diffuse scattering at room temperature. For LaMnAsO, the magnetic Bragg
spot is weaker than the room-temperature thermal diffuse scattering, but its
detection can be facilitated at reduced temperatures.

<h3>Dielectric response of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phase  in thin cells</h3>

<br>
We studied dielectric properties of a polar nematic phase (NF) sandwiched
between two gold or ITO electrodes, serving as a cell surfaces. In bulk, NF is
expected to exhibit a Goldstone mode (phason), because polarization can
uniformly rotate with no energy cost. However, because the coupling between the
direction of nematic director and polarization is finite, and the confinement,
even in the absence of the aligning surface layer, induces some energy cost for
a reorientation of polarization, the phason dielectric relaxation frequency is
measured in a kHz regime. The phason mode is easily quenched by a bias electric
field, which enables fluctuations in the magnitude of polarization to be
followed in both, the ferronematic and nematic phases. This amplitude (soft)
mode is also influenced by boundary conditions. A theory describing the phase
and amplitude fluctuations in the NF phase shows that the free energy of the
system and, consequently, the dielectric response are dominated by
polarization-related terms with the flexoelectricity being relevant only at a
very weak surface anchoring. Contributions due to the nematic elastic terms are
always negligible. The model relates the observed low frequency mode to the
director fluctuations weakly coupled to polarization fluctuations.

<h3>Neutron scattering studies on ionic diffusion behaviors of superionic  $α$-Cu$_{2-δ}$Se</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04718</a>
<br>
<i>Lisi Li, Huili Liu, Maxim Avdeev, Dehong Yu, Sergey Danilkin, Meng Wang</i>
<br>
We present studies on crystal structure and ionic diffusion behaviors of
superionic Cu$_{2-\delta}$Se ($\delta$=0, 0.04, and 0.2) by utilizing neutron
powder diffraction and quasi-elastic neutron scattering. In the superionic
phase, the structural model with Cu ions occupying the Wyckoff sites of 8$c$
and 32$f$ provides the best description of the structure. As the content of Cu
increasing in Cu$_{2-\delta}$Se, the Cu occupancy increases on the 32$f$ site,
but decreases on the 8$c$ site . Fitting to the quasi-elastic neutron
scattering spectra reveals two diffusion modes, the localized diffusion between
the 8$c$ and 32$f$ sites and the long-range diffusion between the adjacent 8$c$
sites using the 32$f$ site as a bypass, respectively. Between 430 and 650 K, we
measured that the compound with more Cu content exhibits a larger long-range
diffusion coefficient. Temperature in this range does not affect the long-range
diffusion process obviously. Our results suggest the two diffusion modes
cooperative and thus provide a microscopic understanding of the ionic diffusion
of the Cu ions in superionic Cu$_{2-\delta}$Se.

<h3>Phases with splay modulation in a system of hard wedges composed of  balls</h3>

<br>
<i>Piotr Kubala, Michał Cieśla, Lech Longa</i>
<br>
We studied equilibrium systems composed of wedge-shaped monodisperse
molecules using hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations. Each model molecule was
built of six co-linear tangent spheres of linearly decreasing diameters. Thus,
the shape was unequivocally described by a single parameter $d$: the ratio of
the smallest and largest sphere diameters. The phases of the systems were
analyzed as a function of $d$ and packing density $\eta$. As interactions were
purely of the excluded-volume type, the emergent phases were governed solely by
the configurational entropy. For $\eta < 0.5$, apart from the isotropic liquid,
we observed standard nematic and smectic A liquid crystalline phases. For $\eta
> 0.5$, however, apart from ordinary non-polar hexagonal crystal, two new
frustrated polar crystalline phases with splay modulation appeared:
antiferroelectric splay crystal ($\text{Cr}_\text{S}\text{P}_\text{A}$) and
ferroelectric splay crystal ($\text{Cr}_\text{S}\text{P}_\text{F}$). All
configurations were studied in terms of nematic, smectic, and hexatic order
parameters, as well as the radial distribution function and the polarization
correlation function.

<h3>The survival of holes as thru-holes in thru-hole epitaxy: How can holes  in 2D layers not sealed off during multiple stacking of those layers?</h3>

<br>

<br>
Thru-hole epitaxy was recently reported to be able to grow readily detachable
domains crystallographically aligned with the underlying substrate over 2D mask
material transferred onto a substrate. While the experimental demonstration of
thru-hole epitaxy of GaN over multiple stacks of $h$-BN was evident, the
detailed mechanism of how small holes in each stack of $h$-BN survived as
thru-holes during multiple stacking of $h$-BN was not intuitively clear. Here,
we show through Monte Carlo simulations that in what conditions holes in each
stack of 2D mask layers can survive as thru-holes during multiple stacking. If
more holes are laterally connected, the survival rate of thru-holes increases
resulting in the epitaxial connectedness. This computational work verifies and
supports that thru-hole epitaxy is attributed to the epitaxial connectedness
established by thru-holes survived even through multiple stacks.

<h3>Two-step devitrification of ultrastable glasses</h3>

<br>

<br>
The discovery of ultrastable glasses has raised novel challenges about glassy
systems. Recent experiments studied the macroscopic devitrification of
ultrastable glasses into liquids upon heating but lacked microscopic
resolution. We use molecular dynamics simulations to analyse the kinetics of
this transformation. In the most stable systems, devitrification occurs after a
very large time, but the liquid emerges in two steps. At short times, we
observe the rare nucleation and slow growth of isolated droplets containing a
liquid maintained under pressure by the rigidity of the surrounding glass. At
large times, pressure is released after the droplets coalesce into large
domains, which accelerates devitrification. This two-step process produces
pronounced deviations from the classical Avrami kinetics and explains the
emergence of a giant lengthscale characterising the devitrification of bulk
ultrastable glasses. Our study elucidates the nonequilibrium kinetics of
glasses following a large temperature jump, which differs from both equilibrium
relaxation and aging dynamics, and will guide future experimental studies.

<h3>Flexible filament in time-periodic viscous flow: shape chaos and period  three</h3>

<br>
<i>Vipin Agrawal, Dhrubaditya Mitra</i>
<br>
We study a single, freely--floating, inextensible, elastic filament in a
linear shear flow: $\mathbf{U}_{0}(x,y) = \dot{\gamma} y \hat{x}$. In our
model: the elastic energy depends only on bending; the rate-of-strain,
$\dot{\gamma} = S \sin(\omega t)$ is a periodic function of time, $t$; and the
interaction between the filament and the flow is approximated by a local
isotropic drag force. Based on the shape of the filament we find five different
dynamical phases: straight, buckled, periodic (with period two, period three,
period four, etc), chaotic, and one with chaotic transients. In the chaotic
phase, we show that the iterative map for the angle, which the end-to-end
vector of the filament makes with the tangent its one end, has period three
solutions; hence it is chaotic. Furthermore, in the chaotic phase the flow is
an efficient mixer.

<br>
<i>Maxime Martinez, Gabriel Lemarié, Bertrand Georgeot, Christian Miniatura, Olivier Giraud</i>
<br>
We study coherent forward scattering (CFS) in critical disordered systems,
whose eigenstates are multifractals. We give general and simple arguments that
make it possible to fully characterize the dynamics of the shape and height of
the CFS peak. We show that the dynamics is governed by multifractal dimensions
$D_1$ and $D_2$, which suggests that CFS could be used as an experimental probe
for quantum multifractality. Our predictions are universal and numerically
verified in three paradigmatic models of quantum multifractality: Power-law
Random Banded Matrices (PRBM), the Ruijsenaars-Schneider ensembles (RS), and
the three-dimensional kicked-rotor (3DKR). In the strong multifractal regime,
we show analytically that these universal predictions exactly coincide with
results from standard perturbation theory applied to the PRBM and RS models.

<br>

<br>
Crystal nucleation is relevant across the domains of fundamental and applied
sciences. However, in many cases its mechanism remains unclear due to a lack of
temporal or spatial resolution. To gain insights to the molecular details of
nucleation, some form of molecular dynamics simulations are typically
performed, which are, in turn, limited by their ability to run long enough to
sample the nucleation event thoroughly. To overcome the timescale limits in
typical molecular dynamics simulations in a manner free of prior human bias,
here we employ the machine learning augmented molecular dynamics framework
``Reweighted Autoencoded Variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE)". We
study the two molecular systems, urea and glycine in explicit all-atom water,
due to their enrichment in polymorphic structures and common utility in
commercial applications. From our simulations, we observe back-and-forth
liquid-solid transitions of different polymorphs, correctly ranking polymorph
stabilities as A- $>$ I- $>$ B-urea and $\gamma$- $>$ $\beta$- $\ge$
$\alpha$-glycine. Finally, the machine learning based reaction coordinates
allow for an in-depth analysis of the nucleation mechanism for both molecules,
providing clear evidence of nonclassical two-step nucleation for both urea and
glycine nucleation in water.

<h3>Breaking through the Mermin-Wagner limit in 2D van der Waals magnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Sarah Jenkins, Levente Rozsa, Unai Atxitia, Richard F. L. Evans, Kostya S. Novoselov, Elton J. G. Santos</i>
<br>
The Mermin-Wagner theorem states that long-range magnetic order does not
exist in one- or two-dimensional (2D) isotropic magnets with short-ranged
interactions. The theorem has been a milestone in magnetism and has been
driving the research of recently discovered 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic
materials from fundamentals up to potential applications. In such systems, the
existence of magnetic ordering is typically attributed to the presence of a
significant magnetic anisotropy, which is known to introduce a spin-wave gap
and circumvent the core assumption of the theorem. Here we show that in
finite-size 2D vdW magnets typically found in lab setups (e.g., within
millimetres), short-range interactions can be large enough to allow the
stabilisation of magnetic order at finite temperatures without any magnetic
anisotropy for practical implementations. We demonstrate that magnetic ordering
can be created in flakes of 2D materials independent of the lattice symmetry
due to the intrinsic nature of the spin exchange interactions and finite-size
effects in two-dimensions. Surprisingly we find that the crossover temperature,
where the intrinsic magnetisation changes from superparamagnetic to a
completely disordered paramagnetic regime, is weakly dependent on the system
length, requiring giant sizes (e.g., of the order of the observable universe
~10$^{26}$ m) in order to observe the vanishing of the magnetic order at
cryogenic temperatures as expected from the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Our findings
indicate exchange interactions as the main driving force behind the
stabilisation of short-range order in 2D magnetism and broaden the horizons of
possibilities for exploration of compounds with low anisotropy at an atomically
thin level.

High quality type-II superconducting contacts have recently been developed to
a variety of 2D systems, allowing one to explore the superconducting proximity
in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. Inducing superconducting correlations into a
chiral system has long been viewed as a route for creating exotic topological
states and excitations. However, it appears that before these exciting
predictions could be realized, one should develop a better understanding of the
limitations imposed by the physics of real materials. Here, we perform a
systematic study of Andreev conversion at the interface between a
superconductor and graphene in the QH regime. We find that the probability of
Andreev conversion of electrons to holes follows an unexpected but clear trend:
the dependencies on temperature and magnetic field are nearly decoupled. We
discuss these trends and the role of the superconducting vortices, whose normal
cores could both absorb and dephase the individual electrons in a QH edge. Our
study may pave the road to engineering future generation of hybrid devices for
exploiting superconductivity proximity in chiral channels.

<h3>Sedimentation path theory for mass-polydisperse colloidal systems</h3>

<br>
Both polydispersity and the presence of a gravitational field are inherent to
essentially any colloidal experiment. While several theoretical works have
focused on the effect of polydispersity on the bulk phase behavior of a
colloidal system, little is known about the effect of a gravitational field on
a polydisperse colloidal suspension. We extend here sedimentation path theory
to study sedimentation of a mass-polydisperse colloidal system: the particles
possess different buoyant masses but they are otherwise identical. The model
helps to understand the interplay between gravity and polydispersity on
sedimentation experiments. Since the theory can be applied to any parent
distribution of buoyant masses, it can be also used to study sedimentation of
monodisperse colloidal systems. We find that mass-polydispersity has a strong
influence in colloidal systems near density matching for which the bare density
of the colloidal particles equals the solvent density. To illustrate the
theory, we study crystallization in sedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium of a
suspension of mass-polydisperse hard spheres.

<br>
<i>Giuseppe Negro, Livio Nicola Carenza, Giuseppe Gonnella, Davide Marenduzzo, Enzo Orlandini</i>
<br>
We study the phase behaviour of cholesteric liquid crystal shells with
different geometries. We compare the cases of tangential and no anchoring at
the surface, focussing on the former case, which leads to a competition between
the intrinsic tendency of the cholesteric to twist and the anchoring free
energy which suppresses it. We then characterise the topological phases arising
close to the isotropic-cholesteric transition. These typically consist of
quasi-crystalline or amorphous tessellations of the surface by half-skyrmions,
which are stable at lower and larger shell size respectively. For ellipsoidal
shells, defects in the tessellation couple to local curvature, and according to
the shell size they either migrate to the poles or distribute uniformly on the
surface. For toroidal shells, the variations in the local curvature of the
surface stabilises heterogeneous phases where cholesteric or isotropic patterns
coexist with hexagonal lattices of half-skyrmions.

<br>
Semiconducting, core-shell nanocrystals (NCs) are promising building blocks
for the construction of higher dimensional artificial nanostructures using
oriented attachment. However, the assembly and epitaxial attachment steps
critical to this construction introduce disorder and defects which inhibit the
observation of desirable emergent electronic phenomena. Consequently,
understanding defect formation and remediation in these systems as a function
of dimensionality is a crucial step to perfecting their synthesis. In this
work, we use in situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy to
examine the role of chloride ligands as remediator agents for imperfect
attachment interfaces between CdSe/CdS core-shell NCs for both 1D and 2D
attachment cases. In the 1D case, we find that the presence of chloride
additives in imperfectly attached NC dimers can result in defect removal speeds
nearly twice as large as those found in their plain, non-chloride treated
counterparts. However, when we increased the dimensionality of the system and
examined 2D NC arrays, we found no statistically significant difference in
attachment interface quality between the chloride and non-chloride treated
samples. We propose that this discongruity arises from fundamental differences
between 1D and 2D NC attachment and discuss synthetic guidelines to inform
future nanomaterial superlattice design.
