<h3>Vortex Fluids on Closed Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05373" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05373</a>

We develop a neutral vortex fluid theory on closed surfaces with zero genus.
The theory describes collective dynamics of many well-separated quantum
vortices in a superfluid confined on a closed surface. In isothermal
coordinates, the corresponding hydrodynamical equation is derived from it on a
plane via the minimal coupling principle. The equation contains an additional
term proportional to Gaussian curvature multiplying the odd viscosity
coefficient contributed by the circulation quantum. This term manifests the
coupling between topological defects and curvature in the macroscopic level.
The generalized relation between the superfluid velocity field generated by the
vortices and the coarse-grained vortex velocity field induces the equation of
motion of point vortices on closed surfaces, verifying the minimal coupling
approach. For a sphere, an exact solution for stationary vortex flow is found
and its velocity distribution has the profile of a Kaufmann vortex in
stereographic coordinates.

<h3>Non-Abelian hyperbolic band theory from supercells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04945" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04945</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick M. Lenggenhager, Joseph Maciejko, Tomáš Bzdušek</i>
<br>
<br>
Tight-binding models on periodic lattices are commonly studied using Bloch
band theory, which provides an efficient description of their energy spectra
and wave functions. Besides Abelian Bloch states characterized by a momentum
vector, the band theory of hyperbolic lattices involves non-Abelian Bloch
states that have so far remained largely inaccessible to analytical treatments.
Here, we systematically construct non-Abelian Bloch states by generalizing to
hyperbolic lattices the familiar solid-state-physics notions of supercells and
zone folding. By applying Abelian hyperbolic band theory to sequences of
supercells, constructed recursively as symmetric aggregates of multiple smaller
cells, we numerically compute the density of states of several elementary and
topological tight-binding models and observe rapid convergence with increasing
supercell size, for both gapless and gapped models. We propose our supercell
method as a first step towards a complete band-theoretic characterization of
hyperbolic lattices and an efficient means of approximating the thermodynamic
limit. We make our algorithms publicly available in a software package to
facilitate future studies of hyperbolic quantum matter.

<h3>Ferroelectric and anomalous quantum Hall states in bare rhombohedral  trilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04950" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04950</a>

Nontrivial interacting phases can emerge in elementary materials. As a prime
example, continuing advances in device quality have facilitated the observation
of a variety of spontaneous quantum Hall-like states, a cascade of Stoner-like
magnets, and an unconventional superconductor in bilayer graphene. Its natural
extension, rhombohedral trilayer graphene is predicted to be even more
susceptible to interactions given its even flatter low-energy bands and larger
winding number. Theoretically, five spontaneous quantum Hall phases have been
proposed to be candidate ground states. Here, we provide transport evidence for
observing four of the five competing ordered states in interaction-maximized,
dually-gated, rhombohedral trilayer graphene. In particular, at vanishing but
finite magnetic fields, two states with Chern numbers 3 and 6 can be stabilized
at elevated and low electric fields, respectively, and both exhibit clear
magnetic hysteresis. We also reveal that the quantum Hall ferromagnets of the
zeroth Landau level are ferroelectrics with spontaneous layer polarizations
even at zero electric field, as evidenced by electric hysteresis. Our findings
exemplify the possible birth of rich interacting electron physics in a simple
elementary material.

<h3>Kinetics of information scrambling in correlated electrons:  disorder-driven transition from shock-wave to FKPP dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04958" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04958</a>
<br>
<i>Camille Aron, Éric Brunet, Aditi Mitra</i>
<br>
<br>
Quenched disorder slows down the scrambling of quantum information. We
formulate a kinetic theory of scrambling in a $d$-dimensional
strongly-correlated metal in the vicinity of a superconducting phase, following
the scrambling dynamics as the impurity scattering rate is increased. Within
this framework, we rigorously show that the butterfly velocity $v$ is bounded
by the light cone velocity $v_{\rm lc } = v_{\rm F}/\sqrt{d}$ where $v_{\rm F}$
is the Fermi velocity. We analytically identify a disorder-driven dynamical
transition occurring at small but finite disorder strength between a spreading
of information characterized at late times by a discontinuous shock wave
propagating at the maximum velocity $v_{\rm lc}$, and a smooth traveling wave
belonging to the Fisher or Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) class and
propagating at a slower, if not considerably slower, velocity. In the diffusive
regime, we establish the relation $v^2/\lambda_{\rm FKPP} \sim D_{\rm el}$
where $\lambda_{\rm FKPP}$ is the Lyapunov exponent set by the inelastic
scattering rate and $D_{\rm el}$ is the elastic diffusion constant.

<h3>Langevin function emerged from Langevin equation as martingale mean  drift</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04976" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04976</a>
<br>
<i>Ken Sekimoto</i>
<br>
<br>
The martingale characterizes a kind of fairness or unbiased nature of the
stochastic process which is associated with another stochastic process. If
$x_t$ evolves according to the Langevin equation whose mean drift is $a_t$ as
function of $x_t,$ and that $a_t$ as induced stochastic process is martingale
in turn associated with the former process, then we show that the amplitude of
$a_t$ is the Langevin function, which is originally the canonical response of a
single classical Heisenberg spin under static field.

<h3>Decay rates of almost strong modes in Floquet spin chains beyond Fermi's  Golden Rule</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04980" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04980</a>
<br>
<i>Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Achim Rosch, Aditi Mitra</i>
<br>
<br>
The stability and dynamics of almost strong zero and $\pi$ modes in weakly
non-integrable Floquet spin chains are investigated. Such modes can also be
viewed as localized Majorana modes at the edge of a topological superconductor.
Perturbation theory in the strength of integrability-breaking interaction $J_z$
is employed to estimate the decay rates of these modes, and compared to decay
rates obtained from exact diagonalization. The structure of the perturbation
theory and thus the lifetime of the modes is governed by the conservation of
quasi-energy modulo $2 \pi/T$, where $T$ is the period of the Floquet system.
If the quasi-energies of minimally $4 n-1$ quasi-particles adds up to zero (or
$\pi/T$ for a $\pi$ mode), the lifetime is proportional to $1/J_z^{2 n}$. Thus
the lifetime is sensitively controlled by the width of the single-particle
Floquet bands. For regimes where the decay rates are quadratic in $J_z$, an
analytic expression for the decay rate in terms of an infinite temperature
autocorrelation function of the integrable model is derived, and shown to agree
well with exact diagonalization.

<h3>Higher-Form Symmetry and Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04984" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04984</a>
<br>
<i>Osamu Fukushima, Ryusuke Hamazaki</i>
<br>
<br>
We elucidate how the presence of higher-form symmetries affects the dynamics
of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. Under reasonable assumptions, we
analytically show that a $p$-form symmetry in a $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum
field theory leads to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
for many nontrivial $(d-p)$-dimensional observables. For higher-form (i.e.,
$p\geq 1$) symmetry, this indicates the absence of thermalization for
observables that are non-local but much smaller than the whole system size. We
numerically demonstrate this argument for the (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theory. While local observables such as the plaquette operator
thermalize, the non-local observable exciting a magnetic dipole instead relaxes
to the generalized Gibbs ensemble that takes account of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
1-form symmetry.

<h3>Boosting Fluxons for Improved Digital Logic using an Aharonov-Casher  Ring</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05021</a>
<br>
<i>Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin Daniel Osborn</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconducting logic is efficient and fast relative to CMOS, but needs
fundamental studies on how to scale to very large circuits. Recently, ballistic
shift registers for single-flux quanta (SFQ) bits were shown in simulation to
allow high energy efficiency and clockless operation. However, the gates are
unpowered such that the bit inertia can only allow a finite number of
sequential gate executions because the bits slow slightly after each gate
operation. Here we show that a structure based on an Aharonov-Casher ring can
power these shift registers by boosting the bit velocity to a constant value,
in spite of unusual bit states constituted by two polarities of SFQ. We discuss
the design of the structure that we consider to be scalable, explain its
operation, and study its performance in terms of boosted velocity, efficiency,
and parameter margins.

<h3>N-States Continous Maxwell Demon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05029" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05029</a>
<br>
<i>Paul Raux, Felix Ritort</i>
<br>
<br>
Maxwell's demon is a famous thought experiment and a paradigm of the
thermodynamics of information. It is related to Szilard's engine, a two-state
information-to-work conversion device in which the demon performs single
measurements and extracts work depending on the state measurement outcome. A
variant of these models, the Continuous Maxwell Demon (CMD), was recently
introduced by Ribezzi-Crivellari and Ritort where work was extracted every time
$\tau$ in a two state model. The CMD was able to extract unbounded amounts of
work at the cost of an unbounded amount of information storage. In this work,
we built a generalization of the CMD to the N-states case. We obtained
generalized analytical expressions for the average work extracted and the
information content. We show that the second law inequality for
information-to-work conversion is fulfilled. We illustrate the results for
N-states with uniform transition rates and for the N=3 case.

<h3>A new mean field approach to finite spin systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05032" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05032</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriel Gil, Augusto Gonzalez</i>
<br>
<br>
It is shown that a spin system is equivalent to a set of constrained harmonic
oscillators. For finite, but large, systems, a continuous approximation to the
density of states can be used, and the oscillator frequencies can be exactly
computed. In the phase transition, the effective frequency of the lowest mode
passes through zero, that is, it becomes an inverted oscillator. In the small
oscillations regime, the oscillators can be treated as independent and the
thermodynamic magnitudes can be computed. We show explicit calculations in a
disordered, frustrated, high coordination number Blume Capel model with 60,000
spins.

<h3>Thermal Conductivity of Water at Extreme Conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05047" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05047</a>
<br>
<i>Cunzhi Zhang, Marcello Puligheddu, Linfeng Zhang, Roberto Car, Giulia Galli</i>
<br>
<br>
Measuring the thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of water at extreme conditions
is a challenging task and few experimental data are available. We predict
$\kappa$ for temperatures and pressures relevant to the conditions of the Earth
mantle, between 1,000 and 2,000 K and up to 22 GPa. We employ close to
equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and a deep neural network potential
fitted to density functional theory data. We then interpret our results by
computing the equation of state of water on a fine grid of points and using a
simple model for $\kappa$. We find that the thermal conductivity is weakly
dependent on temperature and monotonically increases with pressure with an
approximate square-root behavior. In addition we show how the increase of
$\kappa$ at high pressure, relative to ambient conditions, is related to the
corresponding increase in the sound velocity. Although the relationships
between the thermal conductivity, pressure and sound velocity established here
are not rigorous, they are sufficiently accurate to allow for a robust estimate
of the thermal conductivity of water in a broad range of temperatures and
pressures, where experiments are still difficult to perform.

The CALPHAD system of fundamental phase-level databases, now known as the
Materials Genome, has enabled a mature technology of computational materials
design and qualification that has already met the acceleration goals of the
national Materials Genome Initiative. As first commercialized by QuesTek
Innovations, the methodology combines efficient genomic-level parametric design
of new material composition and process specifications with multidisciplinary
simulation-based forecasting of manufacturing variation, integrating efficient
uncertainty management. Recent projects demonstrated under the
multi-institutional CHiMaD Design Center notably include novel alloys designed
specifically for the new technology of additive manufacturing. With the proven
success of the CALPHAD-based Materials Genome technology, current university
research emphasizes new methodologies for affordable accelerated expansion of
more accurate CALPHAD databases. Rapid adoption of these new capabilities by US
apex corporations has compressed the materials design and development cycle to
under 2 years, enabling a new "materials concurrency" integrated into a new
level of concurrent engineering supporting an unprecedented level of
manufacturing innovation.

<h3>Reaction-based mechanism for Nb3Sn nucleation: Role of oxygen</h3>

Intermetallic Nb3Sn alloys have long been believed to form through Sn
diffusion into Nb via grain boundaries. However, our observations of
significant oxygen content in Nb3Sn prompted investigation of alternative
formation mechanisms. Through experiments involving different oxide interfaces
(clean HF-treated, native oxidized, and anodized), we demonstrate a
fundamentally new reaction-based mechanism for Nb3Sn nucleation, which deviates
from the previously known diffusion-based mechanism. Our findings highlight the
critical involvement of a SnOx intermediate phase that further reduces to
metallic Sn, leading to alloy nucleation. This new mechanism identifies the
principles for growth optimization and new synthesis of high-quality Nb3Sn
superconductors.

Response of lipid bilayers to external mechanical stimuli is an active area
of research with implications for fundamental and synthetic cell biology.
However, there is a lack of tools for systematically imposing mechanical
strains and non-invasively mapping out interfacial (membrane) stress
distributions on lipid bilayers. In this article, we report a miniature
platform to manipulate model cell membranes in the form of droplet interface
bilayers (DIBs), and non-invasively measure spatio-temporally resolved
interfacial stresses using two photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of an
interfacially active molecular flipper (Flipper-TR). We established the
effectiveness of the developed framework by investigating interfacial stresses
accompanying three key processes associated with DIBs: thin film drainage
between lipid monolayer coated droplets, bilayer formation, and bilayer
separation. Interestingly, the measurements also revealed fundamental aspects
of DIBs including the existence of a radially decaying interfacial stress
distribution post bilayer formation, and the simultaneous build up and decay of
stress respectively at the bilayer corner and center during bilayer separation.
Finally, utilizing interfacial rheology measurements and MD simulations, we
also reveal that the tested molecular flipper is sensitive to membrane fluidity
that changes with interfacial stress - expanding the scientific understanding
of how molecular motors sense stress.

<h3>Efficient NMR measurement and data analysis supported by the Bayesian  inference : The case of the heavy fermion compound YbCo2Zn20</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05170</a>
<br>
<i>H. Ueda, S. Katakami, S. Yoshida, Y. Nakai, T. Mito, M. Mizumaki, M. Okada</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a data-driven technique to infer microscopic physical quantities
from nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectra, in which the data size and
quality required for the Bayesian inference are investigated. The $^{59}$Co-NMR
measurement of YbCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$ single crystal generates complex spectra with
28 peaks. By exploiting the site symmetry in the crystal structure, the
isotropic Knight shift $K_{iso}$ and nuclear quadrupole resonance(NQR)
frequency $\nu_Q$ were estimated to be $K_{iso} = 0.7822 \pm 0.0090 \%$, $\nu_Q
= 2.008 \pm 0.016$ MHz ( T = 20 K, H $\simeq$ 10.2 T) by analyzing only 30 data
points from one spectrum. The estimation of $\nu_Q$ is consistent with the
precise value obtained in the NQR experiment. Our method can significantly
reduce the measurement time and the computational cost of data analysis in NMR
experiments.

<h3>Origin of the exotic electronic states in antiferromagnetic NdSb</h3>

<br>
<i>Peng Li, Tongrui Li, Sen Liao, Zhipeng Cao, Rui Xu, Yuzhe Wang, Jianghao Yao, Shengtao Cui, Zhe Sun, Yilin Wang, Xiangang Wan, Juan Jiang, Donglai Feng</i>
<br>
<br>
Using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and first
principle calculations, we report that the possible unconventional 2q
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in NdSb can induce unusual modulation on its
electronic structure. The obvious extra bands observed in the AFM phase of NdSb
are well reproduced by theoretical calculations, in which the Fermi-arc-like
structures and sharp extra bands are originated from the in-gap surface states.
However, they are demonstrated to be topological trivial. By tuning the
chemical potential, the AFM phase of NdSb would go through a topological phase
transition, realizing a magnetic topological insulator phase. Hence, our study
sheds new light on the rare earth monopnictides for searching unusual AFM
structure and the potential of intrinsic magnetic topological materials.

<h3>Thermo-electric history effects and resistive switching in epitaxial  thin film of Mott insulator V2O3</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report interesting thermo-electric history effects associated with an
electric field-induced first order phase transition from Mott-insulator to the
metallic state in the epitaxial thin film of V2O3. This phase transition
results in tuneable resistive switching in V2O3. These findings are promising
for novel technologies like optoelectronics and neuromorphic computing and may
lead to highly energy-efficient switching applications of Mott insulators.

<br>
<br>
Upon intense femtosecond photo-excitation, a many-body system can undergo a
phase transition through a non-equilibrium route, but understanding these
pathways remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we use time-resolved second
harmonic generation to investigate a photo-induced phase transition in
Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and show that mesoscale inhomogeneity profoundly influences
the transition dynamics. We observe a marked slowing down of the characteristic
time, $\tau$, that quantifies the transition between two structures. $\tau$
evolves non-monotonically as a function of photo-excitation fluence, rising
from below 200~fs to $\sim$1.4~ps, then falling again to below 200~fs. To
account for the observed behavior, we perform a bootstrap percolation
simulation that demonstrates how local structural interactions govern the
transition kinetics. Our work highlights the importance of percolating
mesoscale inhomogeneity in the dynamics of photo-induced phase transitions and
provides a model that may be useful for understanding such transitions more
broadly.

<h3>Surface characterisation of template-synthesised multi-walled carbon  nanotubes</h3>

Physisorption studies and transmission electron microscopy have been used to
characterise multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) made by a template-synthesis
technique. Microscopic investigations revealed formation of 'branched
nanotubes' with significant irregularities in diameters and with structural
defects on the external surfaces of the tubes. Krypton adsorption isotherms at
77 K were recorded; comparison of these isotherms with those obtained under the
same conditions on well defined MWNTs made by the catalytic chemical vapour
deposition (CCVD) technique is discussed in the light of the sample
morphologies. The effect of annealing on the crystallinity of the surface is
reported.

<h3>Axial and polar magnetism in hexagonal YMnO3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05254</a>
<br>
<i>S. W. Lovesey</i>
<br>
<br>
Newly published diffraction data on hexagonal YMnO3 at a temperature of 10 K
are shown to be consistent with a trusted expression of the magnetic symmetry,
although the data alone are not definitive [M. Ramakrishnan et al., Phys. Rev.
Research 5, 013203 (2023)]. Howard et al. conclude from an exhaustive review of
experimental data that the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic motif of Mn ions
is most likely P63'cm' [C. J. Howard et al., Acta Crystallogr. B 69, 534
(2013)]. The data reported by Ramakrishnan et al. does not eliminate symmetry
P63' from our calculated diffraction patterns, because the studied reflection
vector is parallel to the common chiral vector associated with each triangle of
Mn axial dipole moments. Proposed diffraction patterns will give decisive
statements about the magnetic symmetry in future investigations using resonant
x-ray and magnetic neutron diffraction. To this end, both axial and polar
magnetism in the multiferroic are essential in the analysis of diffraction
patterns. The account by Ramakrishnan et al. of polar magnetism in resonant
x-ray diffraction uses a magnetic symmetry of hexagonal YMnO3 not yet
justified, e.g., ferromagnetism and a linear magnetoelectric effect allowed by
their chosen symmetry have not been observed. We study polar magnetism in
symmetry P63'cm' using Dirac multipoles, including Mn anapoles. They also
feature in amplitudes for magnetic neutron diffraction together with Dirac
quadrupoles, previously shown to account for diffraction by pseudo-gap phases
of cuprate superconductors.

Time-resolved X-ray Emission/Absorption Spectroscopy (Tr-XES/XAS) is an
informative experimental tool sensitive to electronic dynamics in materials,
widely exploited in diverse research fields. Typically, Tr-XES/XAS requires
X-ray pulses with both a narrow bandwidth and sub-picosecond pulse duration, a
combination that in principle finds its optimum with Fourier transform-limited
pulses. In this work, we explore an alternative xperimental approach, capable
of simultaneously retrieving information about unoccupied (XAS) and occupied
(XES) states from the stochastic fluctuations of broadband extreme ultraviolet
pulses of a free-electron laser. We used this method, in combination with
singular value decomposition and Tikhonov regularization procedures, to
determine the XAS/XES response from a crystalline silicon sample at the
L2,3-edge, with an energy resolution of a few tens of meV. Finally, we combined
this spectroscopic method with a pump-probe approach to measure structural and
electronic dynamics of a silicon membrane. Tr-XAS/XES data obtained after
photoexcitation with an optical laser pulse at 390 nm allowed us to observe
perturbations of the band structure, which are compatible with the formation of
the predicted precursor state of a non-thermal solid-liquid phase transition
associated with a bond softening phenomenon.

<h3>Microscopic Theory of Nonlinear Hall Effect Induced by Electric Field  and Temperature Gradient</h3>

Electric current flows parallel to the outer product of an applied electric
field and temperature gradient, a phenomenon we call the nonlinear chiral
thermo-electric (NCTE) Hall effect. We present a general microscopic
formulation of this effect and demonstrate its existence in a chiral crystal.
We show that the contribution of the orbital magnetic moment, which has been
previously overlooked, is just as significant as the conventional Berry
curvature dipole term. Furthermore, we demonstrate a substantial NCTE Hall
effect in a chiral Weyl semimetal. These findings offer new insights into
nonlinear transport phenomena and have significant implications for the field
of condensed matter physics.

The exploration of solid-solid phase transition (SSPT) suffers from the
uncertainty of how two crystal structures match. We devised a theoretical
framework to describe and classify crystal-structure matches (CSM). Such
description fully exploits the translational and rotational symmetries and is
independent of the choice of supercells. This is enabled by the use of the
Hermite normal form, an analog of reduced echelon form for integer matrices.
With its help, exhausting all CSMs is made possible, which goes beyond the
conventional optimization schemes. As a demonstration, our enumeration
algorithm unveils the long-sought concerted mechanisms in the martensitic
transformation of steel accounting for the most commonly observed
Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) orientation relationship (OR) and the Nishiyama-Wassermann
OR. Especially, the predominance of KS OR is explained. Given the unprecedented
comprehensiveness and efficiency, our enumeration scheme provide a promising
strategy for SSPT mechanism research.

We investigated the pressure dependence of gas flow and field ion intensity
of a coaxial ion source operating at room temperature over a wide pressure
range, testing various gases and ionisation voltages. Flow conductance
measurements taking into account the different gases' viscosity and molecular
mass consistently exhibit a generic pattern. Three different flow regimes
appear with increasing upstream pressure. Since the coaxial ion source supplies
the gas locally, very near the apex of the tip where ionisation occurs, large
ionisation currents can be obtained without degrading the propagation
conditions of the beam. Compared with field ionisation in a partial pressure
chamber, using the coaxial ion source increases the ion current a hundredfold
for the same residual low pressure. We also show that the gas flow regime does
not impact ionisation yield. Although a fuller characterisation remains to be
performed, brightness reaches 3 x 10 11 A/m 2 /sr at 12kV extracting voltage.

The photo-induced desorption and oxidation of CO on Ru(0001) is simulated
using ab initio molecular dynamics with electronic friction that accounts for
the non-equilibrated excited electrons and phonons. Different (O,CO) coverages
are considered, the experimental room temperature coverage consisting in
0.5ML-O+0.25ML- CO (low coverage), the saturation coverage achieved
experimentally at low temperatures (0.5ML-O+0.375ML-CO, intermediate coverage),
and the equally mixed monolayer that is stable according to our calculations
but not experimentally observed yet (0.5ML-O+0.5ML-CO, high coverage). The
results of our simulations for the three coverages are consistent with
femtosecond laser experiments showing that the CO photo-desorption largely
dominates over CO photo-oxidation. These results cannot be explained in terms
of the distinct activation energies calculated for the relaxed surfaces.
Different (dynamical) factors such as the coupling to the laser-excited
electrons and, more importantly, the interadsorbate energy exchange and the
strong surface distortions induced in the more crowded surfaces are fundamental
to understand the competition between these two processes under the extremely
non-equilibrated conditions created by the laser.

We present mode-coupling theory (MCT) results for densely packed hard-sphere
fluids confined between two parallel walls and compare them quantitatively to
computer simulations. The numerical solution of MCT is calculated for the first
time using the full system of matrix-valued integro-differential equations. We
investigate several dynamical properties of supercooled liquids including
scattering functions, frequency-dependent susceptibilities and mean-square
displacements. Close to the glass transition, we find quantitative agreement
between the coherent scattering function predicted from theory and evaluated
from simulations, which enables us to make quantitative statements on caging
and relaxation dynamics of the confined hard-sphere fluid.

The investigation of the properties of metal-semiconductor interfaces has
gained significant attention due to the unique features that emerge from the
combination of both metal and semiconductor attributes. In this report, the
magnetic properties of Ni/Si interfaces utilizing X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy at the Ni and Si edges have been studied. This
approach allows to distinguish unambiguously the local magnetism on Ni and Si
via individual core-level excitations. Two samples with different semiconductor
dopings were investigated using both total electron yield (TEY) and
reflectivity configurations. The experimental results uncovered magnetization
at equilibrium in both the metallic layer and in the proximal layer of the
semiconductor substrate, implying the presence of induced spin polarization in
Si at equilibrium, possibly arising from the depletion layer region. These
results hold significant value in the field of spintronics, as similar systems
have been demonstrated to generate spin injection through optical medium,
opening a new pathway for next generation nonvolatile high speed devices.

<h3>Turing Pattern and Chemical Medium-Range Order of Metallic glasses</h3>

The formation of bulk metallic glass requires the constituent elements to
have a negative heat of mixing but has no restrictions on its magnitude. An
understanding of this issue is lacking due to the absence of a valid method for
describing chemical ordering of metallic glasses. For example, the radial
distribution function is ineffective in identifying the elemental preferences
of packed atoms. Here, we show that using molecular-dynamics simulation, the
chemical medium-range ordering of liquid alloys can be evaluated from
persistent homology. This inherently arising chemical medium-range order in
metallic glasses is exclusively regulated by the activation and inhibition of
the constituent components, making the topology of metallic glasses a Turing
pattern. The connecting schemes of atoms of the same species form three
distinct regions, reflecting different correlations at the short and medium
length scales, while the difference in the schemes corresponds to chemical
ordering. By changing the elemental types, it is demonstrated that the chemical
medium-range order strongly depends on the relative depth of the
interatomic-potential wells. The study separates metallic glasses from crystals
under the condition of negative heat of mixing by emphasizing their fundamental
difference in interatomic potentials.

Polarization dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to study the
magnetic ground state and the orbital occupation in bulk-phase VI$_3$ van der
Waals crystals below and above the ferromagnetic and structural transitions.
X-ray natural linear dichroism and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra
acquired at the V $L_{2,3}$ edges are compared against multiplet cluster
calculations within the frame of the ligand field theory to quantify the
intra-atomic electronic interactions at play and evaluate the effects of
symmetry reduction occurring in a trigonally distorted VI$_6$ unit. We observed
a non zero linear dichroism proving the presence of an anisotropic charge
density distribution around the V$^{3+}$ ion due to the unbalanced
hybridization between the Vanadium and the ligand states. Such hybridization
acts as an effective trigonal crystal field, slightly lifting the degeneracy of
the $t_{2g}^2$ ground state. However, the energy splitting associated to the
distortion underestimates the experimental band gap, suggesting that the
insulating ground state is stabilized by Mott correlation effects rather than
via a Jahn-Teller mechanism. Our results clarify the role of the distortion in
VI$_3$ and establish a benchmark for the study of the spectroscopic properties
of other van der Waals halides, including emerging 2D materials with mono and
few-layers thickness, whose fundamental properties might be altered by reduced
dimensions and interface proximity.

<h3>Topological Kolmogorov complexity and the  Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism</h3>

Topology plays a fundamental role in our understanding of many-body physics,
from vortices and solitons in classical field theory, to phases and excitations
in quantum matter. Topological phenomena are intimately connected to the
distribution of information content - that, differently from ordinary matter,
is now governed by non-local degrees of freedom. However, a precise
characterization of how topological effects govern the complexity of a
many-body state - i.e., its partition function - is presently unclear. In this
work, we show how topology and complexity are directly intertwined concepts in
the context of classical statistical mechanics. In concrete, we present a
theory that shows how the \emph{Kolmogorov complexity} of a classical partition
function sampling carries unique, distinctive features depending on the
presence of topological excitations in the system. We confront two-dimensional
Ising and XY models on several topologies, and study the corresponding
samplings as high-dimensional manifolds in configuration space, quantifying
their complexity via the intrinsic dimension. While for the Ising model the
intrisic dimension is independent of the real-space topology, for the XY model
it depends crucially on temperature: across the
Berezkinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, complexity becomes topology
dependent. In the BKT phase, it displays a characteristic dependence on the
homology of the real-space manifold, and, for $g$-torii, it follows a scaling
that is solely genus dependent. We argue that this behavior is intimately
connected to the emergence of an order parameter in data space, the conditional
connectivity, that displays scaling behavior. Our approach paves the way for an
understanding of topological phenomena from the Kolmogorov complexity
perspective, in a manner that is amenable to both quantum mechanical and
out-of-equilibrium generalizations.

We show that the force generated by active enzyme molecules are strong enough
to influence the dynamics of their surroundings under artificial crowded
environments. We measured the behavior of polymer microparticles in a
quasi-two-dimensional system under aqueous environment, at various area
fraction values of particles. In the presence of enzymatic activity not only
the diffusion of the suspended particles at shorter time-scale regime enhanced,
the system also showed a transition from sub-diffusive to diffusive dynamics at
longer time-scale limits. Similar observations were also recorded with enzyme
functionalized microparticles. Brownian dynamics simulations have been
performed to support the experimental observations.

<h3>Glassy heat capacity from overdamped phasons and a hypothetical  phason-induced superconductivity in incommensurate structures</h3>

Phasons are collective low-energy modes that appear in disparate condensed
matter systems such as quasicrystals, incommensurate structures, fluctuating
charge density waves, and Moir\'e superlattices. They share several
similarities with acoustic phonon modes, but they are not protected by any
exact translational symmetry. As a consequence, they are subject to a
wavevector independent damping, and they develop a finite pinning frequency,
which destroy their acoustic linearly propagating dispersion. Under a few and
simple well-motivated assumptions, we compute the phason density of states, and
we derive the phason heat capacity as a function of the temperature. Finally,
imagining a hypothetical s-wave pairing channel with electrons, we compute the
critical temperature $T_c$ of the corresponding superconducting state as a
function of phason damping using the Eliashberg formalism. We find that for
large phason damping, the heat capacity is linear in temperature, showing a
distinctive glass-like behavior. Additionally, we observe that the phason
damping can strongly enhance the effective Eliashberg coupling, and we reveal a
sharp non-monotonic dependence of the superconducting temperature $T_c$ on the
phason damping, with a maximum located at the underdamped to overdamped
crossover scale. Our simple computations confirm the potential role of
overdamped modes in explaining the glassy properties of incommensurate
structures, but also in possibly inducing strongly-coupled superconductivity
therein, and enhancing the corresponding $T_c$.

The magneto-optical properties of titanium dioxide systems are related to the
presence of impurity states in the band gap due to oxygen vacancies. To
understand about the interplay between localized electrons and structural
distortions at the vacancy sites and the magneto-optical properties, we employ
a self-interaction corrected density functional theory method to calculate bulk
and small nanoparticles of rutile, anatase, and brookite titania. Our
computations reveal bipolaron configurations associated to an oxygen vacancy
with optical transition levels in the band gap. The ground state for these
bipolarons is a spin-triplet state in bulk rutile TiO2 and also in the
nanoparticles independently of the crystal phase, a result which may support
the idea of oxygen vacancies as a source of magnetism in this material. The
ground state for bipolarons in bulk anatase TiO2 is however a spin-singlet
state, different from the spin-triplet configuration reported in a previous
work based on hybrid functionals.

Functional networks are powerful tools to study statistical interdependency
structures in spatially extended or multi-variable systems. They have been used
to get insights into the dynamics of complex systems in various areas of
science. In particular, percolation properties of correlation networks have
been employed to identify precursors for critical transitions. In this work, we
further investigate the corresponding potential of percolation measures for the
anticipation of different types of sudden shifts in the state of coupled
irregularly-oscillating systems. As a paradigmatic model system, we study the
dynamics of a ring of diffusively coupled noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators and
show that, when the oscillators are nearly completely synchronized, the
percolation-based precursors successfully anticipate the rapid switches between
the two states of the system. By isolating the stochastic component of the
individual dynamics from the deterministic mean-field behavior, we unveil the
mechanisms behind the percolation transitions in the correlation network:
namely common trends and the synchronization of stochastic fluctuations. We
then apply the same methodology to real-world data of sea surface temperature
anomalies during different phases of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation. This
leads to a better understanding of the factors that make percolation precursors
effective as early warning indicators of incipient El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na
events.

Nano- and microplastics are a growing threat for the environment, especially
in aqueous habitats. For assessing the influence on the ecosystem and possible
solution strategies, it is necessary to investigate the fate of microplastics
(MP) in the environment. MPs are typically surrounded by natural organic
matter, which can cause them to aggregate. However, the effect of MP shape and
flow conditions on this heteroaggregation is not well understood. To address
this gap, we perform simulations of heteroaggregation of different MP shapes
with smaller spherical organic matter. We demonstrate that the shape had a
strong impact on the aggregate structure. MPs with mostly smooth surfaces
formed compact structures with a large number of neighbors with weak connection
strength and a higher fractal dimension. MPs with edges and corners aggregated
into more fractal structures with fewer neighbors, but with stronger
connections. Using MPCD, we investigated aggregates under shear flow. The
critical shear rate at which the aggregates break up is much larger for
spherical and rounded cube MPs, i.e, the compact aggregate structure of spheres
outweighs their weaker connection strength. Most notably, the rounded cube
exhibited unexpectedly high resistance against breakup under shear. We
attribute this to being fairly compact due to weaker, flexible neighbor
connections, which are still strong enough to prevent particles to break off
during shear flow. Irrespective of the stronger connections between
neighbouring MPs, the fractal aggregates of cubes break up at lower shear
rates. We find that cube aggregates reduced their radius of gyration
significantly, indicating restructuring, while most neighbor connections were
kept intact. Aggregates of spheres, however, kept their overall size while
undergoing local rearrangements, that broke a significant portion of their
neighbor interactions.

Particles that are catalytically-active and chemotactic can interact through
the concentration fields upon which they act, which in turn may lead to
wide-scale spatial self-organization. When these active particles interact
through several fields, these interactions gain an additional structure, which
can result in new forms of collective behaviour. Here, we study a mixture of
active species which catalyze the conversion of a substrate chemical into a
product chemical, and chemotax in concentration gradients of both substrate and
product. Such species develop non-reciprocal, specific interactions that we
coarse-grain into attractive and repulsive, which can lead to a potentially
complex interaction network. We consider the particular case of a metabolic
cycle of three species, each of which interacts with itself and both other
species in the cycle. We find that the stability of a cycle of species that
only chemotax in gradients of their substrate is piloted by a set of two
parameter-free conditions, which we use to classify the low number of
corresponding interaction networks. In the more general case of substrate- and
product-chemotactic species, we can derive a set of two high-dimensional
stability conditions, which can be used to classify the stability of all the
possible interaction networks based on the self- and pair-interaction motifs
they contain. The classification scheme that we introduce can help guide future
studies on the dynamics of complex interaction networks and explorations of the
corresponding large parameter spaces in such metabolically active complex
systems.

We describe a method that focuses sampling effort on a user-defined selection
of a large system, which can lead to substantial decreases in computational
effort by speeding up the calculation of nonbonded interactions. A naive
approach can lead to incorrect sampling if the selection depends on the
configuration in a way that is not accounted for. We avoid this pitfall by
introducing appropriate auxiliary variables. This results in an implementation
that is closely related to configurational freezing and elastic barrier
dynamical freezing. We implement the method and validate that it can be used to
supplement conventional molecular dynamics in free energy calculations
(absolute hydration and relative binding).

The growing trend towards engineering interfacial complexion (or phase)
transitions has been seen in the grain boundary and solid surface
systems.Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to the chemically
heterogeneous solid/liquid interfaces. In this work, novel in-plane
multi-interfacial states coexist within the Cu(111)/Pb(l) interface at a
temperature just above the Pb freezing point is uncovered using atomistic
simulations.Four monolayer interfacial states, i.e., two CuPb alloy liquids and
two pre-freezing Pb solids, are observed coexisting within two interfacial
layers sandwiched between the bulk solid Cu and bulk liquid Pb. Through
computing the spatial variations of various properties along the direction
normal to the in-plane solid-liquid boundary lines for both interfacial layers,
a rich and varied picture depicting the inhomogeneity and anisotropy in the
mechanical, thermodynamical, and dynamical properties is presented. The bulk
values extracted from the in-plane profiles suggest that each interfacial state
examined has distinct equilibrium values from each other and significantly
deviates from those of the bulk solid and liquid phases, and indicate that the
complexion (or phase) diagrams for the Cu(111)/Pb(l) interface bears a
resemblance to that of the eutectic binary alloy systems, instead of the
monotectic phase diagram for the bulk CuPb alloy. The reported data could
support the development of interfacial complexion (or phase) diagrams and
interfacial phase rules and provide a new guide for regulating heterogeneous
nucleation and wetting processes.

<h3>Thermal-bath effects in quantum quenches within quantum critical regimes</h3>

<br>
<br>
We address the out-of-equilibrium dynamics arising from quantum-quench (QQ)
protocols (instantaneous changes of the Hamiltonian parameters) in many-body
systems within their quantum critical regime and in contact with thermal baths,
homogeneously coupled to the systems. We consider two classes of QQ protocols.
One of them uses the thermal bath to prepare the initial Gibbs state; then,
after quenching, the thermal bath is removed and the dynamics of the system is
unitary. Wealso address a more complex QQ protocol where the thermal bath is
not removed after quenching, thus the quantum evolution is also driven by the
interaction with the bath, which may be described by appropriate master
equations for the density matrix of the system, where a further relevant time
scale, or inverse decay rate, characterizes the system-bath coupling. Under
these QQ protocols, the critical system develops out-of-equilibrium scaling
behaviors, which extend those forisolated critical systems, by introducing
further scaling variables proportional to the temperature and the decay rate
associated with the thermal baths. These out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors
are checked by analyzing QQ protocols within fermionic Kitaev wires, or
equivalently quantum Ising chains, supplemented with a particular modelization
of thermal bath that guarantees the asymptotic thermalization within the
Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of open systems.

<br>
<br>
The magnetic excitations in ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ were studied by inelastic
neutron scattering combining experiments on triple-axis and time-of-flight
spectrometers with and without polarization analysis. A quadratic spin-wave
dispersion with an anisotropy gap describes the low-energy low-temperature
response. The magnon dispersion extends to at least 35 meV and there is no
direct evidence for a continuum of Stoner excitations below this energy.
However, the magnon response is weakened at higher energy. In addition to the
anomalous softening of the spin-wave stiffness and of the gap, which is induced
by the topology of the Bloch states, the magnon excitations are broadened in
energy and this effect increases upon heating.

Photoinduced nonequilibrium states in the Mott insulators reflect the
fundamental nature of competition between itinerancy and localization of the
charge degrees of freedom. The spin degrees of freedom will also contribute to
the competition in a different manner depending on lattice geometry. We
investigate pulse-excited optical responses of a half-filled two-leg Hubbard
ladder and compare them with those of a one-dimensional extended Hubbard chain.
Calculating the time-dependent optical conductivity, we find that strong
mono-cycle pulse inducing quantum tunneling gives rise to anomalous suppression
of photo-induced in-gap weight, leading to negative weight. This is in contrast
to finite positive weight in the Hubbard chain. The origin of this anomalous
behavior in the two-leg ladder is attributed to photoinduced localized exciton
that reflects strong spin-singlet dimer correlation in the ground state.

Muonium (Mu), a pseudo-isotope atom of hydrogen with a positively charged
muon at the place of the proton, can form in a wide range of semiconductor
materials. They can appear in different states, depending on their charge state
and microscopic site within a crystal lattice. After the Mu formation, they
undergo interactions with free charge carriers, electronic spins, and other Mu
sites, and form a dynamic network of state exchange. We identified the model of
Mu dynamics in n-type Gallium Arsenide using the density matrix simulation and
photoexcited muon spin spectroscopy technique. Fitting to the dark and
illuminated $\mu$SR data provided transition rates between Mu states, which in
turn showed the underlying mechanism of the $\mu$SR time spectra. Deduced
capture/scattering cross sections of the Mu states reflected the microscopic
dynamics of Mu. Illumination studies enable us to measure interactions between
Mu and generated minority carriers, which are unavailable in dark measurements.
The methodology we developed in this study can be applied to other
semiconductor systems for a deeper microscopic understanding of the Mu state
exchange dynamics.

We demonstrate dispersive charge sensing of Si/SiGe single and double quantum
dots (DQD) by coupling sub-micron floating gates to a radio frequency
reflectometry (rf-reflectometry) circuit using the tip of an atomic force
microscope (AFM). Charge stability diagrams are obtained in the phase response
of the reflected rf signal. We demonstrate single-electron dot-to-lead and
dot-to-dot charge transitions with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 and
integration time of $\tau~=~2.7~\mathrm{ms}$ and $\tau~=~6.4~\mathrm{ms}$,
respectively. The charge sensing SNR compares favorably with results obtained
on conventional devices. Moreover, the small size of the floating gates largely
eliminates the coupling to parasitic charge traps that can complicate the
interpretation of the dispersive charge sensing data.

The charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric responses are investigated on a
single-helical molecule possessing a collinear antiferromagnetic spin
arrangement with zero net magnetization in the presence of a transverse
electric field. Both the short and long-range hopping scenarios are considered,
which mimic biological systems like single-stranded DNA and $\alpha$-protein
molecules. A non-equilibrium Green's function formalism is employed following
the Landauer-Buttiker prescription to study the thermoelectric phenomena. The
detailed dependence of the basic thermoelectric quantities on helicity,
electric field, temperature etc., are elaborated on, and the underlying physics
is explained accordingly. The charge and spin \textit{figure of merits} are
computed and compared critically. For a more accurate estimation, the phononic
contribution towards thermal conductance is also included. The present
proposition shows a favorable spin-dependent thermoelectric response compared
to the charge counterpart.

Atomic gases confined in curved geometries display distinctive features that
are absent in their flat counterparts, such as periodic boundaries, local
curvature, and nontrivial topologies. The recent experiments with shell-shaped
quantum gases and the study of one dimensional rings point out that the
manifold of a quantum gas could soon become a controllable feature, thus
allowing to address the fundamental study of curved many-body quantum systems.
Here, we review the main geometries realized in the experiments, analyzing the
theoretical and experimental status on their phase transitions and on the
superfluid dynamics. In perspective, we delineate the study of vortices, the
few-body physics, and the search for analog models in various curved geometries
as the most promising research areas.

<h3>Intrinsic coherence length anisotropy in nickelate, and some pnictide,  and chalcogenide superconductors</h3>

Nickelate superconductors, ${R_{1-x}}{A_x}Ni{O_2}$ (where R is a rare earth
metal and A = Sr, Ca), experimentally discovered in 2019 exhibit many
unexplained mysteries as the existence of a superconducting state with $T_c$ up
to 18 K in thin films and its absence in bulk materials. Another unexplained
mystery of nickelates is their temperature-dependent upper critical field,
$B_{c2}(T)$, which can be nicely fitted to two-dimensional (2D) models; however
the deduced film thickness, $d_{sc,GL}$, exceeds the physical film thickness,
$d_{sc}$, by a manifold. To address the latter, it should be noted that 2D
models assume that $d_{sc}$ is less than the in-plane, $\xi_{ab}(0)$, and
out-of-plane, $\xi_{c}(0)$, ground state coherence lengths, respectively, and,
in addition, that the inequality $\xi_{c}(0) < \xi_{ab}(0)$ satisfies. Analysis
of the reported experimental $B_{c2}(T)$ data showed that at least one of these
conditions does not satisfy for ${R_{1-x}}{A_x}Ni{O_2}$ films. This implies
that nickelate films are not 2D superconductors, even despite though that the
superconducting state is observed only in thin films. Based on this, here we
proposed analytical three dimensional (3D) model for global data fit of
in-plane and out-of-plane $B_{c2}(T)$ in nickelates. The model is based on a
heuristic expression for temperature dependent coherence length anisotropy,
$\gamma_{\xi}(T)$. The proposed expression for $\gamma_{\xi}(T)$, perhaps, has
a much broader application because it has been successfully applied to some
bulk pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors.

This study examines the anisotropic dissolution of the basal plane gibbsite
({\gamma}-Al(OH)3) nanoplates in sodium hydroxide solution using in situ atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In the
surface-reaction controlled regime, in situ AFM measurements reveal anisotropic
dissolution of hillocks and etch pits on the gibbsite basal plane, with
preferred dissolution directions alternating between layers. The
mirror-symmetric pattern of dissolution preference between adjacent gibbsite
aluminum hydroxide sheet, observed along the crystallographic a-c plane,
results from the matching symmetry between the structures of the adjacent (001)
and (002) crystal planes. Consequently, the overall dissolution rate of
gibbsite nanoplates exhibits crystallographic a-c plane symmetry, as the rate
of parallel steps is governed by the slower ones. DFT calculations suggest that
the anisotropic dissolution is partially due to the orientation and strength of
Al-OH-Al linkages pair within gibbsite surface structure. These findings offer
a comprehensive understanding of anisotropic dissolution behavior of gibbsite
and illuminate the mechanisms behind preferential dissolution.

<h3>Energetic contributions to deformation twinning in magnesium</h3>

Modeling deformation twin nucleation in magnesium has proven to be a
challenging task. In particular, the absence of a heterogeneous twin nucleation
model which provides accurate energetic descriptions for twin-related
structures belies a need to more deeply understand twin energetics. To address
this problem, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to follow the
energetic evolution of $\{10\overline{1}2\}$ tension twin embryos nucleating
from an asymmetrically-tilted grain boundary. The line, surface and volumetric
terms associated with twin nucleation are identified. A micromechanical model
is proposed where the stress field around the twin nucleus is estimated using
the Eshelby formalism, and the contributions of the various twin-related
structures to the total energy of the twin are evaluated. The reduction in the
grain boundary energy arising from the change in character of the prior grain
boundary is found to be able to offset the energy costs of the other
interfaces. The defect structures bounding the stacking faults that form inside
the twin are also found to possibly have significant energetic contributions.
These results suggest that both of these effects could be critical
considerations when predicting twin nucleation sites in magnesium.

Micro-mechanical resonator performance is fundamentally limited by the
coupling to a thermal environment. The magnitude of this thermodynamical effect
is typically considered in accordance with a physical temperature, assumed to
be uniform across the resonator's physical span. However, in some
circumstances, e.g. quantum optomechanics or interferometric gravitational wave
detection, the temperature of the resonator may not be uniform, resulting in
the resonator being thermally linked to a spatially varying thermal bath. In
this case, the link of a mode of interest to its thermal environment is less
straightforward to understand. Here, we engineer a distributed bath on a
germane optomechanical platform -- a phononic crystal -- and utilize both
highly localized and extended resonator modes to probe the spatially varying
bath in entirely different bath regimes. As a result, we observe striking
differences in the modes' Brownian motion magnitude. From these measurements we
are able to reconstruct the local temperature map across our resonator and
measure nanoscale effects on thermal conductivity and radiative cooling. Our
work explains some thermal phenomena encountered in optomechanical experiments,
e.g. mode-dependent heating due to light absorption. Moreover, our work
generalizes the typical figure of merit quantifying the coupling of a resonator
mode to its thermal environment from the mechanical dissipation to the overlap
between the local dissipation and the local temperature throughout the
resonator. This added understanding identifies design principles that can be
applied to performance of micro-mechanical resonators.

<h3>Time-reversal and PT symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian field theories</h3>

We study time-reversal symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian fluctuating field
theories with conserved dynamics, comprising the mesoscopic descriptions of a
wide range of nonequilibrium phenomena. They exhibit continuous parity-time
(PT) symmetry breaking phase transitions to dynamical phases. For two concrete
transition scenarios, exclusive to non-Hermitian dynamics, namely oscillatory
instabilities and critical exceptional points, a low-noise expansion exposes a
pre-transitional surge of the mesoscale (informatic) entropy production rate,
inside the static phases. Its scaling in the susceptibility contrasts
conventional critical points (such as second-order phase transitions), where
the susceptibility also diverges, but the entropy production generally remains
finite. The difference can be attributed to active fluctuations in the
wavelengths that become unstable. For critical exceptional points, we identify
the coupling of eigenmodes as the entropy-generating mechanism, causing a
drastic noise amplification in the Goldstone mode.

Materials-by-design has been historically challenging due to complex
process-microstructure-property relations. Conventional analytical or
simulation-based approaches suffer from low accuracy or long computational time
and poor transferability, further limiting their applications in solving the
inverse material design problem. Here, we establish a deep learning- and
genetic algorithm-based framework that combines forward prediction and inverse
exploration. Our framework provides an end-to-end solution for microstructure
optimization to achieve application-specific mechanical properties of
materials. In this study, we select the widely used Ti-6Al-4V to demonstrate
the effectiveness of this framework by tailoring its microstructure to achieve
various yield strength and elastic modulus across a large design space, while
minimizing the stress concentration factor. Compared with conventional methods,
our framework is efficient, versatile, and readily transferrable to other
materials and properties. Paired with additive manufacturing's potential in
controlling local microstructural features, our method has far-reaching
potential for accelerating the development of application-specific,
high-performing materials.
