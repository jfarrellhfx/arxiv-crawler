<h3>Global density equations for interacting particle systems with  stochastic resetting: from overdamped Brownian motion to phase  synchronization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03501" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03501</a>

<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<p>A wide range of phenomena in the natural and social sciences involve large
systems of interacting particles, including plasmas, collections of galaxies,
coupled oscillators, cell aggregations, and economic ``agents'. Kinetic methods
for reducing the complexity of such systems typically involve the derivation of
nonlinear partial differential equations for the corresponding global
densities. In recent years there has been considerable interest in the mean
field limit of interacting particle systems with long range interactions. Two
major examples are interacting Brownian particles in the overdamped regime and
the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators. In this paper we analyze these
systems in the presence of local or global stochastic resetting, where the
position or phase of each particle independently or simultaneously resets to
its original value at a random sequence of times generated by a Poisson
process. In each case we derive the Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation describing
hydrodynamic fluctuations of the global density, and then use a mean field
ansatz to obtain the corresponding nonlinear McKean-Vlasov (MV) equation in the
thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show how the MV equation for global
resetting is driven by a Poisson shot noise process, reflecting the fact that
resetting is common to all of the particles and thus induces correlations that
cannot be eliminated by taking a mean field limit. We then investigate the
effects of local and global resetting on nonequilibrium stationary solutions of
the macroscopic dynamics and, in the case of the Kuramoto model, the reduced
dynamics on the Ott-Antonsen manifold.

<h3>Discontinuous transition in electrolyte flow through charge-patterned  nanochannels</h3>

<i>Tine Curk, Sergi G. Leyva, Ignacio Paganobarraga</i>
<p>We investigate the flow of an electrolyte through a rigid nanochannel
decorated with a surface charge pattern. Employing lattice Boltzmann and
dissipative particle dynamics methods, as well as analytical theory, we show
that electro-hydrodynamic coupling leads to two distinct flow profiles. The
accompanying discontinuous transition between slow, ionic and fast, Poiseuille
regime is observed only at intermediate ion concentrations, channel widths and
electrostatic coupling strengths, implying that the phenomenon is a mesoscopic
collective effect that is not captured by the weak or the strong coupling
limits. These findings indicate routes to design nanochannels containing a
typical aqueous electrolyte that exhibit a digital on/off flux response, which
could be useful for nanofluidics and ionotronic applications.

<h3>Applications of the kinetic theory for a model of a confined quasi-two  dimensional granular mixture: Stability analysis and thermal diffusion  segregation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03822" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03822</a>
<br>
<i>Vicente Garz√≥, Ricardo Brito, Rodrigo Soto</i>
<p>The Boltzmann kinetic theory for a model of a confined quasi-two dimensional
granular mixture derived previously [Garz\'o, Brito and Soto, Phys. Fluids
\textbf{33}, 023310 (2021)] is considered further to analyze two different
problems. First, a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations with
respect to the homogeneous steady state (HSS) is carried out to identify the
conditions for stability as functions of the wave vector, the coefficients of
restitution, and the parameters of the mixture. The analysis, which is based on
the results obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the
Chapman--Enskog method to first order in spatial gradients, takes into account
the (nonlinear) dependence of the transport coefficients and the cooling rate
on the coefficients of restitution and applies in principle to arbitrary values
of the concentration, and the mass and diameter ratios. In contrast to the
results obtained in the conventional inelastic hard sphere (IHS) model, the
results show that all the hydrodynamic modes are stable so that, the HSS is
linearly \emph{stable} with respect to long enough wavelength excitations. As a
second application, segregation induced by both a thermal gradient and gravity
is studied. A segregation criterion based on the dependence of the thermal
diffusion factor $\Lambda$ on the parameter space of the mixture is derived.
Comparison with previous results derived from the IHS model is carried out.

<h3>Breathing mode of a quantum droplet in a quasi-one-dimensional dipolar  Bose gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03918</a>
<br>
<i>Edmond Orignac, Stefania De Palo, Luca Salasnich, Roberta Citro</i>
<p>We investigate the breathing mode and the stability of a quantum droplet in a
tightly trapped one-dimensional dipolar gas of bosonic atoms. When the droplet
with a flat-top density profile is formed, the breathing mode frequency scales
as the inverse of the number of atoms in the cloud. This is straightforwardly
derived within a phenomenological hydrodynamical approach and confirmed using
both a variational method based on a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii action
functional and the sum-rule approach. We extend our analysis also to the
presence of axial confinement showing the effect of the trap on the density
profile and therefore on the breathing mode frequency scaling. Our analysis
confirms the stability of the quantum droplet against the particles emission
when the flat-top density profile is observed. Our results can be used as a
guide to the experimental investigations of collective modes to detect the
formation of quantum droplets in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar gases.

<h3>Stable nodal line semimetals in the chiral classes in three dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02966" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02966</a>
<br>
<i>Faruk Abdulla, Ganpathy Murthy, Ankur Das</i>
<p>It has been realized over the past two decades that topological nontriviality
can be present not only in insulators but also in gapless semimetals, the most
prominent example being Weyl semimetals in three dimensions. Key to topological
classification schemes are the three ``internal" symmetries, time reversal
${\cal T}$, charge conjugation ${\cal C}$, and their product, called chiral
symmetry ${\cal S}={\cal T}{\cal C}$. In this work, we show that robust
topological nodal line semimetal phases occur in $d=3$ in systems whose
internal symmetries include ${\cal S}$, without invoking crystalline symmetries
other than translations. Since the nodal loop semimetal naturally appears as an
intermediate gapless phase between the topological and the trivial insulators,
a sufficient condition for the nodal loop phase to exist is that the symmetry
class must have a nontrivial topological insulator in $d=3$. Our classification
uses the winding number on a loop that links the nodal line. A nonzero winding
number on a nodal loop implies robust gapless drumhead states on the surface
Brillouin zone. We demonstrate how our classification works in all the
nontrivial chiral classes and how it differs from the previous understanding of
topologically protected nodal line semimetals.

<h3>Large enhancement of spin-orbit torques under a MHz modulation due to  phonon-magnon coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02967" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02967</a>
<br>
<i>Hanying Zhang, Qianwen Zhao, Baiqing Jiang, Yuan Wang, Tunan Xie, Kaihua Lou, ChaoChao Xia, C. Bi</i>
<p>The discovery of spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through the spin Hall or
Rashba effects provides an alternative write approach for magnetic
random-access memory (MRAM), igniting the development of spin-orbitronics in
recent years. Quantitative characterization of SOTs highly relies on the
SOT-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR), where a modulated microwave
current is used to generate ac SOTs and the modulation-frequency is usually
less than 100 kHz (the limit of conventional lock-in amplifiers). Here we have
investigated the SOT of typical SOT material/ferromagnet bilayers in an
extended modulation-frequency range, up to MHz, by developing the ST-FMR
measurement. Remarkably, we found that the measured SOTs are enhanced about
three times in the MHz range, which cannot be explained according to present
SOT theory. We attribute the enhancement of SOT to additional magnon
excitations due to phonon-magnon coupling, which is also reflected in the
slight changes of resonant field and linewidth in the acquired ST-FMR spectra,
corresponding to the modifications of effective magnetization and damping
constant, respectively. Our results indicate that the write current of SOT-MRAM
may be reduced with the assistant of phonon-magnon coupling.

<h3>Periodically driven four-dimensional topological insulator with tunable  second Chern number</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02973</a>
<br>
<i>Zheng-Rong Liu, Rui Chen, Bin Zhou</i>
<p>In recent years, Floquet engineering has attracted considerable attention as
a promising approach for tuning topological phase transitions. In this work, we
investigate the effects of high-frequency time-periodic driving in a
four-dimensional (4D) topological insulator, focusing on topological phase
transitions at the off-resonant quasienergy gap. The 4D topological insulator
hosts gapless three-dimensional boundary states characterized by the second
Chern number $C_{2}$. We demonstrate that the second Chern number of 4D
topological insulators can be modulated by tuning the amplitude of
time-periodic driving. This includes transitions from a topological phase with
$C_{2}=\pm3$ to another topological phase with $C_{2}=\pm1$, or to a
topological phase with an even second Chern number $C_{2}=\pm2$ which is absent
in the 4D static system. Finally, the approximation theory in the
high-frequency limit further confirms the numerical conclusions.

<h3>Open problems within Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02977</a>

<i>Kenric P. Nelson</i>
<p>Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics has developed into an important framework
for modeling the thermodynamics of complex systems and the information of
complex signals. Upon the 80th birthday of the field's founder, Constantino
Tsallis, a review of open problems that can stimulate future research is
provided. Over the thirty-year development of NSM a variety of criticisms have
been published ranging from questions about the justification for generalizing
the entropy function to interpretation of the generalizing parameter q. While
these criticisms have been addressed in the past and the breadth of
applications has demonstrated the utility of the NSM methodologies, this review
provides insights on how the field can continue to improve the understanding
and application of complex system models. The review starts by grounding
q-statistics within scale-shape distributions and then frames a series of open
problems for investigation. The open problems include using the degree of
freedom to quantify the difference between entropy and its generalization;
clarifying the physical interpretation of the parameter q; improving the
definition of the generalized product using multidimensional analysis; defining
a generalized Fourier transform applicable to signal processing applications;
and re-examination of the normalization of nonextensive entropy. The review
concludes with a proposal that the shape parameter is a candidate for defining
the statistical complexity of a system.

<h3>BCS-BEC crossover in atomic Fermi gases in quasi-two-dimensional Lieb  lattices: Effects of flat band and finite temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02990" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02990</a>
<br>
<i>Hao Deng, Lin Sun, Chuping Li, Yuxuan Wu, Junru Wu, Qijin Chen</i>
<p>We investigate the finite-temperature superfluid behavior of ultracold atomic
Fermi gases in quasi-two-dimensional Lieb lattices with a short-range
attractive interaction, using a pairing fluctuation theory within the BCS-BEC
crossover framework. We find that the presence of a flat band, along with van
Hove singularities, leads to exotic quantum phenomena. As the Fermi level
enters the flat band, both the gap and the superfluid transition temperature
$T_c$ as a function of interaction change from a conventional exponential
behavior into an unusual power law, and the evolution of superfluid densities
with temperature also follows a power law even at weak interactions. The
quantum geometric effects, manifested by an enhanced effective pair hopping
integral, may contribute significantly to both $T_c$ and the superfluidities.
As the chemical potential crosses the van Hove singularities in the weak
interaction regime, the nature of pairing changes between particle-like and
hole-like. A pair density wave state emerges at high densities with a
relatively strong interaction strength.

<h3>Homogeneous functions of degree one and heat phenomena in potential  fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03010</a>
<br>
<i>Valentin K. Kochnev</i>
<p>The variational argument is presented to establish the attainability of
homogeneity of degree one in the number of particles for any functional $F[n,
f]$ that depends on both the state variable $f$ and the particle count $n$.
Euler's integration of homogeneous functions applies to any such functional.
This argument is employed to examine the heat equilibrium of a system
containing an undefined and unconserved number of indistinguishable particles
within each cell $h^3$ in the quantized phase-space of particle coordinates and
momenta, with $h$ representing the Planck constant, including for the case of
the smallest system of a single elementary volume. The system does not exchange
particles with a reservoir, and the uncertainty in particle count is intrinsic
to the system itself. The system is maintained at a constant temperature $T$
with a chemical potential denoted by $\mu$. The definition of chemical
potential is based on variational principles related to homogeneous functions
of degree one. The equilibrium particle density is analyzed in the presence of
gravitational and electric fields characterized by a central $\frac{1}{r}$
reciprocally decaying potential, where the local density of potential field
sources is provided for partition functions defined by the nature of the
particles. A star is a point source of gravitation embedded in a rarefied
ambient gas, where heat phenomena create a 'dark' illusion of additional mass
presence. For an atomic core as a point source of an electric field in an
electron gas, the study explores the temperature-dependent potential barrier in
the electric field in atoms, where electron states correspond to particle
states moving in the potential field with a barrier situated between a well and
a valley. The homogeneous functionals for particle density energy and particle
energy itself are discussed.

<h3>Impact of a Lifshitz Transition on the onset of spontaneous coherence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03013" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03013</a>
<br>
<i>Adam Eaton, Dibya Mukherjee, Herbert Fertig</i>
<p>Lifshitz transitions are topological transitions of a Fermi surface, whose
signatures typically appear in the conduction properties of a host metal. Here,
we demonstrate, using an extended Falicov- Kimball model of a two-flavor
fermion system, that a Lifshitz transition which occurs in the noninteracting
limit impacts interaction-induced insulating phases, even though they do not
host Fermi surfaces. For strong interactions we find a first order transition
between states of different polarization This transition line ends in a very
unusual quantum critical endpoint, whose presence is stabilized by the onset of
inter-flavor coherence. We demonstrate that the surfaces of maximum coherence
in these states reflect the distinct Fermi surface topologies of the states
separated by the non-interacting Lifshitz transition. The phenomenon is shown
to be independent of the band topologies involved. Experimental realizations of
our results are discussed for both electronic and optical lattice systems.

<h3>Improper two-dimensional electron gas formation</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel Bennett, Pablo Aguado-Puente, Emilio Artacho, Nicholas Bristowe</i>
<p>In spite of the interest in the two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)
experimentally found at surfaces and interfaces, important uncertainties remain
about the observed insulator--metal transitions (IMTs). Here we show how an
explicit improper coupling of carrier sources with a relevant soft mode
significantly affects the transition. The analysis presented here for 2DEGs at
polar interfaces is based on group theory, Landau-Ginzburg theory, and
illustrated with first-principles calculations for the prototypical case of the
LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, for which such a structural transition has
recently been observed. This direct coupling implies that the appearance of the
soft mode is always accompanied by carriers. For sufficiently strong coupling
an avalanche-like first-order IMT is predicted.

<h3>Bose-enhanced relaxation of driven atom-molecule condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03026</a>
<br>
<i>Dimitri Pimenov, Erich J. Mueller</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experiments we study the interconversion between
ultracold atomic and molecular condensates, quantifying the resulting
oscillations and their slow decay. We find that near equilibrium the dominant
damping source is the decay of condensed molecules into non-condensed pairs,
with a pair kinetic energy that is resonant with the frequency of the
oscillating atom-molecule interconversions. The decay, however, is
non-exponential, as strong population of the resonant pairs leads to Bose
enhancement. Introducing an oscillating magnetic field, which periodically
modulates the molecular binding energy, enhances the oscillations at short
times. However, the resulting enhancement of the pair-production process
results in an accelerated decay which rapidly cuts off the initial oscillation
growth.

<h3>Scaling of Fock space propagator in quasiperiodic many-body localizing  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03027" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03027</a>
<br>
<i>Soumi Ghosh, Jagannath Sutradhar, Subroto Mukerjee, Sumilan Banerjee</i>
<p>Recently many body localized systems have been treated as a hopping problem
on a Fock space lattice with correlated disorder, where the many-body
eigenstates exhibit multi-fractal character. The many-body propagator in Fock
space has been shown to be useful for capturing this multifractality and
extracting a Fock-space localization length for systems with random disorder in
real space. Here we study a one-dimensional interacting system of spinless
Fermions in the presence of a deterministic quasiperiodic potential using the
Fock-space propagator. From the system-size scaling of the self-energy
associated with the diagonal elements and the scaling of the off-diagonal
elements of the propagator, we extract fractal characteristics and FS
localization lengths, respectively, which behave similarly to that in the
random system. We compute the sample-to-sample fluctuations of the typical
self-energy and the off-diagonal propagator over different realizations of the
potential and show that the fluctuations in the self-energy distinguish
quasiperiodic and random systems, whereas the fluctuations of the off-diagonal
elements cannot demarcate the two types of potential.

<h3>Phase transitions and scale invariance in topological Anderson  insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03028" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03028</a>
<br>
<i>Bryan D. Assun√ß√£o, Gerson J. Ferreira, Caio H. Lewenkopf</i>
<p>We investigate disordered-driven transitions between trivial and topological
insulator (TI) phases in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Our study primarily
focuses on the BHZ model with Anderson disorder, while other standard 2DTI
models exhibit equivalent features. The analysis is based on the local Chern
marker (LCM), a local quantity that allows for the characterization of
topological transitions in finite and disordered systems. Our simulations
indicate that disorder-driven trivial to topological insulator transitions are
nicely characterized by $\mathcal{C}_0$, the \textit{disorder averaged} LCM
near the central cell of the system. We show that $\mathcal{C}_0$ is
characterized by a single-parameter scaling, namely, $\mathcal{C}_0(M, W, L)
\equiv \mathcal{C}_0(z)$ with $z = [W^\mu-W_c^\mu(M)]L$, where $M$ is the Dirac
mass, $W$ is the disorder strength and $L$ is the system size, while $W_c(M)
\propto \sqrt{M}$ and $\mu \approx 2$ stand for the critical disorder strength
and critical exponent, respectively. Our numerical results are in agreement
with a theoretical prediction based on a first-order Born approximation (1BA)
analysis. These observations lead us to speculate that the universal scaling
function we have found is rather general for amorphous and disorder-driven
topological phase transitions.

<h3>Machine learning inspired models for Hall effects in non-collinear  magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03044" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03044</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan Kipp, Fabian R. Lux, Thorben P√ºrling, Abigail Morrison, Stefan Bl√ºgel, Daniele Pinna, Yuriy Mokrousov</i>
<p>The anomalous Hall effect has been front and center in solid state research
and material science for over a century now, and the complex transport
phenomena in nontrivial magnetic textures have gained an increasing amount of
attention, both in theoretical and experimental studies. However, a clear path
forward to capturing the influence of magnetization dynamics on anomalous Hall
effect even in smallest frustrated magnets or spatially extended magnetic
textures is still intensively sought after. In this work, we present an
expansion of the anomalous Hall tensor into symmetrically invariant objects,
encoding the magnetic configuration up to arbitrary power of spin. We show that
these symmetric invariants can be utilized in conjunction with advanced
regularization techniques in order to build models for the electric transport
in magnetic textures which are, on one hand, complete with respect to the point
group symmetry of the underlying lattice, and on the other hand, depend on a
minimal number of order parameters only. Here, using a four-band tight-binding
model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the developed method can be
used to address the importance and properties of higher-order contributions to
transverse transport. The efficiency and breadth enabled by this method
provides an ideal systematic approach to tackle the inherent complexity of
response properties of noncollinear magnets, paving the way to the exploration
of electric transport in intrinsically frustrated magnets as well as
large-scale magnetic textures.

<h3>Double-domed temperature-pressure phase diagram found for CePd3S4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03057</a>
<br>
<i>S. Huyan, T. J. Slade, H. Wang, R. Flint, R. A. Ribeiro, W. Xie, S. L. Bud'ko, P. C. Canfield</i>
<p>CePd3S4 exhibits interplay between ferromagnetism (FM), quadrupolar order,
and the Kondo effect at low temperatures with a FM transition temperature that
is much higher than the value expected from the de Gennes scaling of the
heavier RPd3S4 compounds. In this work, we investigated the electrical
transport and magnetic properties of CePd3S4 under pressure up through 12 GPa
so as to better understand the interplay between electronic and magnetic phases
in this material. Our findings show that the low pressure FM state is suddenly
replaced by a new magnetically ordered phase that is most likely
antiferromagnetic that spans from ~ 7 GPa to ~ 11 GPa. Whereas this could be
described as an example of avoided quantum criticality, given that clear
changes in resistance and Hall data are detected near 6.3 GPa for all
temperatures below 300 K, it is also possible that the change in ground state
is a response to a pressure induced change in structure. The lack of any
discernible change in the pressure dependence of the room temperature unit cell
parameter/volume across this whole pressure range suggests that this change in
structure is either more subtle than could be detected by our measurements
(i.e. development of weak, new wave vector) or the transition is electronic
(such as a Lifshitz transition).

<h3>Phonon thermal Hall effect in charge-compensated topological insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03064" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03064</a>
<br>
<i>Rohit Sharma, Mahasweta Bagchi, Yongjian Wang, Yoichi Ando, Thomas Lorenz</i>
<p>From a systematic study of thermal and charge transport in various single
crystals of compensated topological insulators we identify the evolution of a
large low-temperature thermal Hall effect as a characteristic common feature.
In order to separate phononic and electronic contributions in the measured
longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity, the electronic contributions
are estimated from corresponding electrical resisivity and Hall effect
measurements on the same samples by using the Wiedemann-Franz law. As may be
expected for charge-compensated topological insulators the longitudinal thermal
conductivity is phonon-dominated in all samples. However, we also find a
pronounced field-linear thermal Hall effect that becomes most pronounced in the
low-temperature range, where all samples are good electrical insulators. This
indicates an underlying phononic mechanism of the thermal Hall effect and in
this respect the topological insulators resemble other, mainly ionic,
insulators, which have been reported to show a phonon-induced thermal Hall
effect, but its underlying phononic mechanism remains to be identified. Our
observation of a comparable thermal Hall ratio in topological insulators
supports a theoretical scenario that explains a thermal Hall effect through
skew scattering on charged impurities.

<h3>Anomalous diffusion of scaled Brownian tracers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03127" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03127</a>
<br>
<i>Francisco J. Sevilla, Adriano Vald√©s-G√≥mez, Alexis Torres-Carbajal</i>
<p>A model for anomalous transport of tracer particles diffusing in complex
media in two dimensions is proposed. The model takes into account the
characteristics of persistent motion that active bath transfer to the tracer,
thus the model proposed in here extends active Brownian motion, for which the
stochastic dynamics of the orientation of the propelling force is described by
scale Brownian motion (sBm), identified by a the time dependent diffusivity of
the form $D_\beta\propto t^{\beta-1}$, $\beta>0$. If $\beta\neq1$, sBm is
highly non-stationary and suitable to describe such a non-equilibrium dynamics
induced by complex media. In this paper we provide analytical calculations and
computer simulations to show that genuine anomalous diffusion emerge in the
long-time regime, with a time scaling of the mean square displacement
$t^{2-\beta}$, while ballistic transport $t^2$, characteristic of persistent
motion, is found in the short-time one. An analysis of the time dependence of
the kurtosis, and intermediate scattering function of the positions
distribution, as well as the propulsion auto-correlation function, which
defines the effective persistence time, are provided.

<h3>Endless Dirac nodal lines and high mobility in kagome semimetal  Ni3In2Se2 single crystal</h3>

<i>Sanand Kumar Pradhan, Sharadnarayan Pradhan, Priyanath Mal, P. Rambabu, Archana Lakhani, Bipul Das, Bheema Lingam Chittari, G. R. Turpu, Pradip Das</i>
<p>Kagome-lattice crystal is crucial in quantum materials research, exhibiting
unique transport properties due to its rich band structure and the presence of
nodal lines and rings. Here, we investigate the electronic transport properties
and perform first-principles calculations for Ni$_{3}$In$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ kagome
topological semimetal. First-principle calculations indicate six endless Dirac
nodal lines and two nodal rings with a $\pi$-Berry phase in the
Ni$_{3}$In$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ compound. The temperature-dependent resistivity is
dominated by two scattering mechanisms: $s$-$d$ interband scattering occurs
below 50 K, while electron-phonon ($e$-$p$) scattering is observed above 50 K.
The magnetoresistance (MR) curve aligns with the theory of extended Kohler's
rule, suggesting multiple scattering origins and temperature-dependent carrier
densities. A maximum MR of 120\% at 2 K and 9 T, with a maximum estimated
mobility of approximately 3000 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ are observed. The Ni
atom's hole-like d$_{x^{2}-y^{2} }$ and electron-like d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals
exhibit peaks and valleys, forming a local indirect-type band gap near the
Fermi level (E$_{F}$). This configuration enhances the motion of electrons and
holes, resulting in high mobility and relatively high magnetoresistance.

dichalcogenide that has demonstrated promise in a variety of applications. Van
der Waals heterostructures, which are created by stacking distinct 2D crystals
on top of each other, are becoming increasingly important due to their unique
optoelectronic and electromechanical properties. Using molecular dynamics
simulations, the mechanical characteristics of vertically stacked Silicene/MoS2
van der Waals heterostructures are examined in this study. The response and
structural stability of the heterostructures at various loading orientations
and temperatures are given particular attention. The research findings
highlight that the fracture strength of the Silicene/MoS2 heterostructure
decreases by 40% in both armchair and zigzag orientations when the temperature
is raised from 100K to 600K. Furthermore, a linear decrease in Young's modulus
is observed as temperature rises. It is noteworthy that the Rule of Mixture
(ROM) predictions for Young's Moduli are observed to be marginally lower than
the simulation results. The analyses reveal that the silicene layer fractures
first under both loading directions shows crack propagation at +-60{\deg}in the
armchair and predominantly perpendicular in zigzag, followed by subsequent MoS2
layer failure. The study also shows that the MoS2 layer largely determines the
elastic properties of the heterostructure, whereas the silicene layer primarily
dictates the failure of the heterostructure. These findings offer an in-depth
understanding of the mechanical properties of Silicene/MoS2 heterostructures,
with significant implications for their use in cutting-edge nanoelectronics and
nanomechanical systems.

<h3>Cavity magnonics with domain walls in insulating ferromagnetic wires</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03164" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03164</a>
<br>
<i>Mircea Trif, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</i>
<p>Magnetic domain walls (DWs) are topological defects that exhibit robust
low-energy modes that can be harnessed for classical and neuromorphic
computing. However, the quantum nature of these modes has been elusive thus
far. Using the language of cavity optomechanics, we show how to exploit a
geometric Berry-phase interaction between the localized DWs and the extended
magnons in short ferromagnetic insulating wires to efficiently cool the DW to
its quantum ground state or to prepare nonclassical states exhibiting a
negative Wigner function that can be extracted from the power spectrum of the
emitted magnons. Moreover, we demonstrate that magnons can mediate long-range
entangling interactions between qubits stored in distant DWs, which could
facilitate the implementation of a universal set of quantum gates. Our proposal
relies only on the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the ferromagnet, and can be
naturally extended to explore the quantum dynamics of DWs in ferrimagnets and
antiferromagnets, as well as quantum vortices or skyrmions confined in
insulating magnetic nanodisks.

<h3>Random Linear Systems with Quadratic Constraints: from Random Matrix  Theory to replicas and back</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03209" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03209</a>
<br>
<i>Pierpaolo Vivo</i>
<p>I present here a pedagogical introduction to the works by Rashel Tublin and
Yan V. Fyodorov on random linear systems with quadratic constraints, using
tools from Random Matrix Theory and replicas. These notes illustrate and
complement the material presented at the Summer School organised within the
Puglia Summer Trimester 2023 in Bari (Italy). Consider a system of $M$ linear
equations in $N$ unknowns, $\sum_{j=1}^N A_{kj}x_j=b_k$ for $k=1,\ldots,M$,
subject to the constraint that the solutions live on the $N$-sphere,
$x_1^2+\ldots + x_N^2=N$. Assume that both the coefficients $A_{ij}$ and the
parameters $b_i$ be independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Using
two different approaches -- based on Random Matrix Theory and on a replica
calculation -- it is possible to compute whether a large linear system subject
to a quadratic constraint is typically solvable or not, as a function of the
ratio $\alpha=M/N$ and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the $b_i$'s. This is done by
defining a quadratic loss function $H({\bf
x})=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^M\left[\sum_{j=1}^NA_{kj} x_j-b_k\right]^2$ and
computing the statistics of its minimal value on the sphere,
$E_{min}=\min_{||\bf x||^2=N}H({\bf x})$, which is zero if the system is
compatible, and larger than zero if it is incompatible. One finds that there
exists a compatibility threshold $0<\alpha_c<1$, such that systems with
$\alpha>\alpha_c$ are typically incompatible. This means that even weakly
under-complete linear systems could become typically incompatible if forced to
additionally obey a quadratic constraint.

<h3>Viscosity bounds in liquids with different structure and bonding types</h3>

<i>M. Withington, H. L. Devereux, C. Cockrell, A. M. Elena, I. T. Todorov, Z. K. Liu, S. L. Shang, J. S. McCloy, P. A. Bingham, K. Trachenko</i>
<p>Recently, it was realised that liquid viscosity has a lower bound which is
nearly constant for all liquids and is governed by fundamental physical
constants. This was supported by experimental data in noble and molecular
liquids. Here, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to
ascertain this bound in two other important liquid types: the ionic molten salt
system LiF and metallic Pb. We find that these ionic and metallic systems
similarly have lower viscosity bounds corresponding to the minimum of kinematic
viscosity of about 10$^{-7}$ $\frac{{\rm m}^2}{\rm s}$. We show that this
agrees with experimental data in other systems with different structures and
bonding types, including noble, molecular, metallic and covalent liquids. This
expands the universality of viscosity bounds into the main system types known.

<p>In a series of three papers, Jurgens and Crutchfield recently proposed a
supposedly novel method to compute entropies of hidden Markov models (HMMs),
discussed in detail its relationship to iterated function systems, and applied
it to compute their ``ambiguity rates", a concept supposedly introduced by
Claude Shannon. We point out that the basic formalism is not new (it is the
well known ``forward algorithm" for HMMs), and that all three papers have also
serious other faults.

<h3>Detecting magneto-optical interactions in nanostructures</h3>

<br>
<i>Luana Hildever, Thiago Ferro, Adrielson Dias, Andr√© Jos√©, Francisco Estrada, Jos√© Holanda</i>
<p>Effects due to magneto-optical interactions are responsible for most of the
phenomena discovered in optoelectronics and spintronics. Magneto-optical
interactions can generate elementary excitations of the order of light-magnetic
matter, which can flow under certain conditions. Here, we observe the
intensities of magneto-optical interactions in hexagonal arrays of magnetic
nanowires using experimental measurements and simulations. Nanowires of three
materials (cobalt-Co, iron-Fe, and nickel-Ni) were electrodeposited on alumina
membranes by the AC electrodeposition method. Our results reveal that the
magneto-optical behavior can produce, under certain conditions, a kind of
avalanche of magneto-optical interactions, which is dynamic. Such an
observation shows the possibility of generating a magneto-optical current
(spin-opto current).

<h3>Enhancement of Ising superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$ via surface  fluorination</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03348</a>
<br>
<i>Jizheng Wu, Wujun Shi, Chong Wang, Wenhui Duan, Yong Xu, Chen Si</i>
<p>Recently discovered Ising superconductors have garnered considerable interest
due to their anomalously large in-plane upper critical fields ($B_{c2}$).
However, the requisite strong spin-orbital coupling in the Ising pairing
mechanism generally renders these superconductors heavy-element dominant with
notably low superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$). Here, based on the
Migdal-Eliashberg theory and the mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian,
we demonstrate a significant enhancement of Ising superconductivity in
monolayer NbSe$_2$ through surface fluorination, as evidenced by concomitant
improvements in $T_c$ and $B_{c2}$. This enhancement arises from three
predominant factors. Firstly, fluorine atoms symmetrically and stably adhere to
both sides of the monolayer NbSe$_2$, thereby maintaining the out-of-plane
mirror symmetry and locking carrier spins out-of-plane. Secondly, fluorination
suppresses the charge density wave in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and induces a van Hove
singularity in the vicinity of the Fermi level, leading to a marked increase in
the number of carriers and, consequently, strengthening the electron-phonon
coupling (EPC). Lastly, the appearance of fluorine-related, low-frequency
phonon modes further augments the EPC. Our findings suggest a promising avenue
to elevate $T_c$ in two-dimensional Ising superconductors without compromising
their Ising pairing.

<h3>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</h3>

<i>Tatsuya Yanagisawa, Ruo Hibino, Hiroyuki Hidaka, Hiroshi Amitsuka, Toshiyuki Tashima, Mitsuhiro Akatsu, Yuichi Nemoto, Sergei Zherlitsyn, Joachim Wosnitza</i>
<p>This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the softening of
synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. Herein, we
argue that this elastic softening can be attributed to the effect of
electric-quadrupole degrees of freedom of the dangling bonds in the neutral
single-atom vacancies of carbon. We present the results of ultrasonic
investigations of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds, namely type-IIa
(colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature
synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We
observe a magnetic-field-insensitive softening of the elastic constant $C_{44}$
in all samples at low temperatures below 1 K. Our results strongly suggest a
ppb level concentration of neutral single-atomic vacancies in all investigated
diamonds. Our findings open new avenues for the quantitative determination of
single neutral vacancies in non-irradiated diamonds, an important information
needed for their potential application for quantum technology and
next-generation semiconductor devices.

<h3>Rectangular carbon nitrides C4N monolayers with a zigzag buckled  structure: Quasi-one-dimensional Dirac nodal lines and topological flat edge  states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03402</a>
<br>
<i>Linyang Li, Jialei Li, Yawei Yu, Yuxuan Song, Jia Li, Xiaobiao Liu, Fran√ßois M. Peeters, Xin Chen, Guodong Liu</i>
<p>Due to the flexibility of C and N atoms in forming different types of bonds,
the prediction of new two-dimensional (2D) carbon nitrides is a hot topic in
the field of carbon-based materials. Using first-principles calculations, we
propose two C4N monolayers with a zigzag buckled (ZB) structure. The ZB C4N
monolayers contain raised-C (raised-N) atoms with sp3 hybridization, different
from the traditional 2D graphene-like carbon nitride materials with sp2
hybridization. Interestingly, the band structures of the ZB C4N monolayers
exhibit quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Dirac nodal line that results from the
corresponding quasi-1D structure of the zigzag carbon chains, which is
essentially different from the more common ring-shaped nodal line. The quasi-1D
Dirac nodal line exhibits the following features: (i) gapless Dirac points,
(ii) varying Fermi velocity, and (iii) slightly curved band along the
high-symmetry path. All these features are successfully explained by our
proposed tight-binding model that includes interactions up to the third
nearest-neighbor. The Fermi velocity of the 2D system can reach 105 m/s, which
is promising for applications in high-speed electronic devices. The topological
flat band structure determined by the Zak phase and band inversion of the
corresponding 1D system is edge-dependent, which is corresponding to the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, providing to rich physical phenomena.

<h3>Ground state phase diagram and the exotic phases in the spin-1/2 square  lattice J1-J2-Jx model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03434" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03434</a>
<br>
<i>Jianwei Yang, Zhao Liu, Ling Wang</i>
<p>The intricate interplay between frustration and spin chirality has the
potential to give rise to unprecedented phases in frustrated quantum magnets.
We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice
J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity
susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice
symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy
levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase
transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved
through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic
phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely,
a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS
peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a
distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an
anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid
(NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are
demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line
terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS)
phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix
of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement
spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an
SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method.
Furthermore, we delve into a comprehensive discussion on the nature of the NSL,
exploring aspects such as ground state degeneracy, the local bond energy
landscape, and the singlet and triplet gaps on various tori. These analysis
provide substantial evidence supporting the nematic nature of the NSL.

<h3>Deformation of a planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03447</a>
<br>
<i>G R Krishna Chand Avatar, Vivekanand Dabade</i>
<p>While extensive studies have been conducted on purely elastic ribbons, in
this paper we explore the influence of magnetisation on the deformation of
planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbons. We begin the investigation by deriving
the leading-order magnetic energy associated with a curved planar ferromagnetic
elastic ribbon. The sum of the magnetic and the elastic energy is the total
energy of the ribbon. We derive the equilibrium equations by taking the first
variation of the total energy. We then systematically determine and analyse
solutions to these equilibrium equations under various canonical boundary
conditions. We also analyse the stability of the equilibrium solutions.
Comparing our findings with the well-studied Euler's Elastica provides insights
into the magnetic effects on the deformation behaviour of elastic ribbons. Our
analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between
magnetisation and the mechanical response of planar ferromagnetic structures,
and offers valuable insights for both theoretical and practical applications.

<p>We report on the experimental realization of Pb1-xSnxTe pentagonal nanowires
(NWs) with [110] orientation using molecular beam epitaxy techniques. Using
first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural stability in NWs
of SnTe and PbTe in three different structural phases: cubic, pentagonal with
[001] orientation and pentagonal with [110] orientation. Within a semiclassical
approach, we show that the interplay between ionic and covalent bonds favors
the formation of pentagonal NWs. Additionally, we find that this pentagonal
structure is more likely to occur in tellurides than in selenides. The
disclination and twin boundary cause the electronic states originating from the
NW core region to generate a conducting band connecting the valence and
conduction bands, creating a symmetry-enforced metallic phase. The metallic
core band has opposite slopes in the cases of Sn and Te twin boundary, while
the bands from the shell are insulating. We finally study the electronic and
topological properties of pentagonal NWs unveiling their potential as a new
platform for higher-order topology and fractional charge. These pentagonal NWs
represent a unique case of intrinsic core-shell one-dimensional nanostructures
with distinct structural, electronic and topological properties between the
core and the shell region.

<h3>Effects of Li Doping on Superconducting Properties of Citrate Gel  Prepared Y1-xLixBa2Cu3O7-d Compound</h3>

<i>Mahshid Amiri Moghadam, Hassan Gashmard, Seyed Sajjad Hosseini, Hamideh Shakeripour, Hadi Salamati</i>
<p>The Y1-xLixBa2Cu3O7-d polycrystalline bulk superconductors doped with Li
substituting at the Y site at different concentrations (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.1)
were prepared using the citrate-gel method to study the effects of doping on
the superconducting temperature and critical current density. The question was
whether Li addition characterized by a high Debye frequency would have any
positive effects on Tc. The optimum citrate-gel and heat treatment conditions
were identified as those yielding samples with a maximum grain size on the
order of 50 micro.m (up to the optimum Li-doping level, x=0.01). Li
substitution at the Y site was verified by structural, electrical, and magnetic
measurements of the produced samples, whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
revealed the formation of a pure phase with no visible impurity phases.
Moreover, AC magnetic susceptibility measurements showed no increase in the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, consistent with the predicted
results obtained by machine learning method, although it was theoretically
expected to increase owing to the high Debye frequency of Li. This observation
is consistent with magnetic coupling models for pairing mechanism in cuprates.
Finally, because of the optimum conditions of the preparation procedure, nearly
identical values of the critical current density (Jc) were recorded for samples
with different Li doping levels (up to the optimum Li doping level). It was
found that improved compound preparation conditions would have a critical and
extensive effect on Jc enhancement, with nearly no Tc suppression.

<p>We investigate the periodically driven dynamics of many-body systems, either
classical or quantum, finite-dimensional or mean-field, displaying an unbounded
phase-space. We find that the inclusion of a smooth periodic drive atop an
otherwise ergodic dynamics leads to a long-lived prethermalization, even at
moderate driving frequencies. In specific asymptotic limits, we compute the
corresponding prethermal Hamiltonian from an analytical perturbation scheme.

<br>
<i>A. F. P. de Oliveira, A. L. da Rosa, A. C. Dias</i>
<p>Phosphorene is a recently developed two-dimensional (2D) material that has
attracted tremendous attention because of its unique anisotropic optical
properties and quasi-one-dimensional (1D) excitons. We use first-principles
calculations combined with the maximally localized Wannier function tight
binding Hamiltonian (MLWF-TB) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism to
investigate quasiparticle effects of 2D and quasi-1D blue and black phosphorene
nanoribbons. Our electronic structure calculations shows that both blue and
black monolayered phases are semiconductors. On the other hand black
phosphorene zigzag nanoribbons are metallic. Similar behavior is found for very
thin blue phosphorene zig-zag and armchair nanoribbon. As a general behavior,
the exciton binding energy decreases as the ribbon width increases, which
highlights the importance of quantum confinement effects. The solution of the
BSE shows that the blue phosphorene monolayer has an exciton binding energy
four times higher than that of the black phosphorene counterpart. Furthermore,
both monolayers show a different linear optical response with respect to light
polarization, as black phosphorene is highly anisotropic. We find a similar,
but less pronounced, optical anisotropy for blue phosphorene monolayer, caused
exclusively by the quasi-particle effects. Finally, we show that some of the
investigated nanoribbons show a spin-triplet excitonic insulator behavior, thus
revealing exciting features of these nanoribbons and therefore provides
important advances in the understanding of quasi-one dimensional
phosphorus-based materials.

<i>Dima Boriskovsky, Benjamin Lindner, Yael Roichman</i>
<p>The fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) links thermal fluctuations and
dissipation at thermal equilibrium through temperature. Extending it beyond
equilibrium conditions in pursuit of broadening thermodynamics is often
feasible, albeit with system-dependent specific conditions. We demonstrate
experimentally that a generalized FDR holds for a harmonically trapped tracer
colliding with self-propelled walkers. The generalized FDR remains valid across
a large spectrum of active fluctuation frequencies, extending from underdamped
to critically damped dynamics, which we attribute to a single primary channel
for energy input and dissipation in our system.

<i>Kewal Singh Rana, Debattam Sarkar, Nidhi, Aditya Singh, Chandan Bera, Kanishka Biswas, Ajay Soni</i>
<p>Damping of phonon momentum suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity (kl)
through low energy acoustic-optical phonon interactions. We studied the thermal
transport properties and underlying mechanism of phonon interactions in the
large unit cell Cu26V2Sn6Se32. The large number of atoms in the unit cell
results in low acoustic phonon cutoff frequency, flat phonon branches, low
frequency Raman active modes, localized rattler-like vibrations and strong
crystalline anharmonicity. The crystal structure complexity disrupts the phonon
propagation through weak bonded Cu atoms, boson peak and poor phonon velocity.
The sulfur at selenium sites (Cu26V2Sn6Se30S2) distort the crystal lattice by
offering additional scattering mechanism at the anionic sites, thereby
increases the power factor and decreases the kl. This strategic manipulation of
phonon scattering towards ultra-low kl not only results in improved
thermoelectric performance but also offers insights into the fundamental
understanding of heat transport in complex structured, large unit cell
compounds.

<h3>Strain-induced Ferroelectricity and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in  One-dimensional Antiferromagnetic WOI3</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhihao Gong, Yechen Xun, Zhuang Qian, Kai Chang, Jingshan Qi, Hua Wang</i>
<p>The pursuit of multiferroic magnetoelectrics, combining simultaneous
ferroelectric and magnetic orders, remains a central focus in condensed matter
physics. Here we report the centrosymmetric, one-dimensional (1D)
antiferromagnetic WOI$_3$ undergoes a strain-induced ferroelectric distortion.
The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition is originated from the unconventional
anisotropic $d^1$ mechanism, where an unpaired d electron of each W$^{5+}$ ion
contributes to magnetic orders. Employing a Heisenberg model with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict an antiferromagnetic spin
configuration as the paraelectric ground state, transitioning to a
ferroelectric phase with noncollinear spin arrangement under uniaxial strain.
The ferroelectric polarization and noncollinear spin arrangement can be
manipulated by varying the applied strain. While the energy barriers for
switching ferroelectric polarizations with magnetic orders are on the order of
a few dozen of meV, the shift current bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) exhibits
remarkable differences, providing a precise and valuable tool for
experimentally probing the interplay of ferroelectric and magnetic orders in 1D
WOI$_3$.

<i>Tiago Ant√£o, Daniel Miranda, Nuno Peres</i>
<p>We construct a one-dimensional (1D) topological SSH-like model with chiral
symmetry and a superimposed hopping modulation, which we call the chiral
Aubry-Andr\'e model. We show that its topological properties can be described
in terms of a pair (C,W) of a two-dimensional (2D) Chern number C, stemming
from a superspace description of the model, and a 1D winding number W,
originating in its chiral symmetric nature. Thus, we showcase for the first
time explicit coexistence of 1D and 2D topology in a model existing in 1D
physical space. We detail the superspace description by showcasing how our
model can be mapped to a Harper-Hofstadter model, familiar from the description
of the integer quantum Hall effect, and analyze the vanishing field limit
analytically. An extension of the method used for vanishing fields is provided
in order to handle any finite fields, corresponding to hopping modulations both
commensurate and incommensurate with the lattice. In addition, this formalism
allows us to obtain certain features of the 2D superspace model, such as its
number of massless Dirac nodes, purely in terms of topological quantities,
computed without the need to go into momentum space.

<i>S. Sabari, R. Kishor Kumar, Lauro Tomio</i>
<p>Quantum turbulence indicators in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensed fluids,
following emissions of vortex-antivortex pairs generated by a circularly moving
detuned laser, are being provided by numerical simulations of the corresponding
quasi-two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii formalism with repulsive contact
interactions combined with tunable dipole-dipole strength. The critical
velocities of two variants of a circularly moving obstacle are determined and
analyzed for vortex-antivortex nucleation in the form of regular and cluster
emissions. The turbulent dynamical behavior is predicted to follow closely the
initial emission of vortex-antivortex pairs, relying on the expected
Kolmogorov's classical scaling law, which is verified by the spectral analysis
of the incompressible part of the kinetic energy. Within our aim to provide
further support in the up-to-now investigations of quantum turbulence, which
have been focused on non-dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, we emphasize the
role of dipole-dipole interactions in the fluid dynamics.

<h3>Mpemba meets Newton: Exploring the Mpemba and Kovacs effects in the  time-delayed cooling law</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03550" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03550</a>
<br>
<i>Andr√©s Santos</i>
<p>Despite extensive research, the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying
the Mpemba effect, a phenomenon where a substance cools faster after initially
being heated, remain elusive. Although historically linked with water, the
Mpemba effect manifests across diverse systems, sparking heightened interest in
Mpemba-like phenomena. Concurrently, the Kovacs effect, a memory phenomenon
observed in materials like polymers, involves rapid quenching and subsequent
temperature changes, resulting in nonmonotonic relaxation behavior. This paper
probes the intricacies of the Mpemba and Kovacs effects within the framework of
the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling, recognized as a simplistic yet
effective phenomenological model accommodating memory phenomena. This law
allows for a nuanced comprehension of temperature variations, introducing a
time delay ($\tau$) and incorporating specific protocols for the thermal bath
temperature, contingent on a defined waiting time ($t_{\text{w}}$). Remarkably,
the relevant parameter space is two-dimensional ($\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$),
with bath temperatures exerting no influence on the presence or absence of the

<p>The manipulation of particle transport in synthetic quantum matter is an
active research frontier for its theoretical importance and potential
applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate an engineered topological
transport in a synthetic flat-band lattice of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms. We
implement a quasi-one-dimensional rhombic chain with staggered flux in the
momentum space of the atomic condensate and observe biased local oscillations
that originate from the interplay of the staggered flux and flat-band
localization under the mechanism of Aharonov-Bohm caging. Based on these
features, we design and experimentally confirm a state-dependent chiral
transport under the periodic modulation of the synthetic flux. We show that the
phenomenon is topologically protected by the winding of the Floquet Bloch bands
of a coarse-grained effective Hamiltonian. The observed chiral transport offers
a strategy for efficient quantum device design where topological robustness is
ensured by fast Floquet driving and flat-band localization.

<p>Surface currents emerge in superconductors exposed to magnetic fields, and
are a key signature of the Meissner effect. Analogously, chiral dynamics were
observed in quantum simulators under synthetic Abelian gauge fields. The
flexible control of these simulators also facilitates the engineering of
non-Abelian gauge fields, but their impact on the chiral dynamics remains
elusive. Here, by employing the cutting-edge momentum-lattice technique, we
implement a synthetic SU(2) gauge field in a spinful 1D ladder and study the
rich chiral dynamics therein. We confirm the non-Abelian nature of the
synthetic potential by observing the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect on a
single plaquette. More importantly, the chiral current along the two legs of
the ladder is observed to be spin-dependent and highly tunable through the
parameters of the gauge potential. We experimentally map out different dynamic
regimes of the chiral current, and reveal the underlying competition between
overlaying flux ladders with distinct spin compositions. Our experiment
demonstrates the dramatic impact of non-Abelian gauge fields on the system
dynamics, paving the way for future studies of exotic synthetic gauge fields on
the versatile platform of momentum lattices.

<h3>Fast and high-fidelity dispersive readout of a spin qubit via squeezing  and resonator nonlinearity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03617" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03617</a>
<br>
<i>Chon-Fai Kam, Xuedong Hu</i>
<p>Fast and high-fidelity qubit measurement is crucial for achieving quantum
error correction, a fundamental element in the development of universal quantum
computing. For electron spin qubits, fast readout stands out as a major
obstacle in the pursuit of error correction. In this work, we explore the
dispersive measurement of an individual spin in a semiconductor double quantum
dot coupled to a nonlinear microwave resonator. By utilizing displaced squeezed
vacuum states, we achieve rapid and high-fidelity readout for semiconductor
spin qubits. Our findings reveal that introducing modest squeezing and mild
nonlinearity can significantly improve both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the fidelity of qubit-state readout. By properly marching the phases of
squeezing, the nonlinear strength, and the local oscillator, the optimal
readout time can be reduced to the sub-microsecond range. With current
technology parameters ($\kappa\approx 2\chi_s$, $\chi_s\approx 2\pi\times 0.15
\:\mbox{MHz}$), utilizing a displaced squeezed vacuum state with $30$ photons
and a modest squeezing parameter $r\approx 0.6$, along with a nonlinear
microwave resonator charactered by a strength of $\lambda\approx -1.2 \chi_s$,
a readout fidelity of $98\%$ can be attained within a readout time of around
$0.6\:\mu\mbox{s}$. Intriguing, by using a positive nonlinear strength of
$\lambda\approx 1.2\chi_s$, it is possible to achieve an SNR of approximately
$6$ and a readout fidelity of $99.99\%$ at a slightly later time, around
$0.9\:\mu\mbox{s}$, while maintaining all other parameters at the same
settings.

<p>We theoretically describe the stationary regime and coherent dynamics of a
capacitively shunted transmon-type qubit which is placed in front of a mirror.
The considered qubit is irradiated by two signals: pump (dressing) and probe.
By changing amplitudes and frequencies of these signals we study the system
behaviour. The main tool of our theoretical analysis is solving of the Lindblad
equation. We also consider Lindblad superoperators in charge and energy bases
and compare the results. Theoretically obtained occupation probability is
related to the experimentally measured value. This study helps to understand
better the properties of qubit-mirror system and gives new insights about the
underlying physical processes.

<h3>Thermal fluctuations (eventually) unfold nanoscale origami</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03628</a>
<br>
<i>Matthew Grasinger, Pradeep Sharma</i>
<p>There has been a resurgence of interest in using origami principles--along
with $2$D materials--to design a wide array of nanoscale devices. In this work,
we take cognizance of the fact that small-scale devices are vulnerable to
entropic thermal fluctuations and thus a foundational question underlying
small-scale origami pertains to its stability. To properly understand the
behavior of these origami-based nanodevices, we must simultaneously consider
the geometric mechanics of origami along with the interplay between thermal
fluctuations, entropic repulsive forces, van der Waals attraction, and other
molecular-scale phenomena. In this work, to elucidate the rich behavior
underpinning the evolution of an origami device at the nanoscale, we develop a
minimal statistical mechanics model of folded nanoscale sheets. We use the
model to investigate (1) the thermodynamic multistability of nanoscale origami
structures and (2) the rate at which thermal fluctuations drive its
unfolding--that is, its temporal stability. We identify, for the first time, an
entropic torque that is a critical driving force for the unfolding process.
Both the thermodynamic multistability and temporal stability have a nontrivial
dependence on the origami's bending stiffness, the radii of curvature of its
creases, the ambient temperature, its thickness, and its interfacial energy
(between folded layers). Specifically, for graphene, we show that there is a
critical side length below which it can no longer be folded with stability;
similarly, there exists a critical crease diameter, membrane thickness (e.g.
for multilayer graphene), and temperature above which a crease cannot be stably
folded. To investigate the rate of thermally driven unfolding, we extend
Kramers' escape rate theory to cases where the minima of the energy well occurs
at a boundary.

<h3>Active nematics that modify their environment: a framework for  extra-cellular matrix remodeling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03688" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03688</a>
<br>
<i>Ram M. Adar, Jean-Fran√ßois Joanny</i>
<p>Many exemplary active systems, including living cells and animals, are able
to form nematic order, while interacting with their environment. In this
Letter, we explain how a dynamic coupling of an active nematic with its
environment results in novel physical behavior. Deposition of aligned
environment segments modifies the isotropic-nematic phase diagram and allows
for nematic order at arbitrarily low densities. The aligned environment acts as
an external field that may also lead to arrested angular dynamics. We are
motivated mainly by cells that remodel collagen fibers in the extra-cellular
matrix (ECM), while being guided by the fibers during multicellular migration.
Our predictions indicate that remodeling promotes macroscopic cellular order
and ECM patterning, and possibly limits the coarsening of ordered ECM domains,
in accordance with recent experiments.

<p>We investigate the antiferromagnetic heavy fermion superconductor UPd2Al3,
employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to unravel the complex
electronic structure of its U 5f electrons. We observe unexpected
characteristics that challenge the conventional temperature-dependent behavior
of heavy fermion systems, revealing unexpected characteristics. At temperatures
above the anticipated coherence temperature (T$^*$), we observe itinerant U 5f
electrons at temperatures higher than previously postulated. Additionally, a
previously unidentified dispersionless band emerges around 600 meV below the
Fermi energy, potentially linked to spin-orbit splitting within the U 5f
states. Hybridization between the 5f electrons and conduction band was observed
with an energy dispersion of 10 meV at low temperatures, suggesting that U 5f
electrons near and at the Fermi surface have an itinerant nature.
Temperature-dependent 5d-5f resonance spectra reveal that the 5f electron
spectrum weight increases with lowering temperature and begins to decrease at
temperatures significantly higher than the Neel temperature (T$_N$). We further
show that the competition between the Kondo effect and
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions may be responsible for the
relocalization of 5f electrons, making relocalization a precursor to the
establishment of magnetic order at lower temperatures. Our experiments also
provide evidence that 5f electrons with the same orbital are involved in both
the Kondo effect and RKKY interactions, suggesting that the two coexist at
lower temperatures.

<h3>Probing Chiral-Symmetric Higher-Order Topological Insulators with  Multipole Winding Number</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03699" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03699</a>
<br>
<i>Ling Lin, Chaohong Lee</i>
<p>The interplay between crystalline symmetry and band topology gives rise to
unprecedented lower-dimensional boundary states in higher-order topological
insulators (HOTIs). However, the measurement of the topological invariants of
HOTIs remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose the multipole winding
number (MWN) for chiral-symmetric HOTIs, achieved by applying a corner twisted
boundary condition. The MWN, arising from both bulk and boundary states, may
accurately capture the bulk-corner correspondence in finite systems. To address
the measurement challenge, we leverage the perturbative nature of the corner
twisted boundary condition and develop a real-space approach for determining
the MWN in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. The real-space
formula provides an experimentally viable strategy for directly probing the
topology of chiral-symmetric HOTIs through dynamical evolution. Our findings
not only highlight the twisted boundary condition as a powerful tool for
investigating HOTIs, but also establish a paradigm for exploring real-space
formulas for the topological invariants of HOTIs.

<br>
<i>A. V. Kavokin, M. E. Portnoi, A. A. Varlamov, Yuriy Yerin</i>
<p>The well-known Mott's formula links the thermoelectric power characterised by
Seebeck coefficient to conductivity. We calculate analytically the
thermoelectric current and Seebeck coefficient in one-dimensional systems and
show that, while the prediction of Mott's formula is valid for Dirac fermions,
it is misleading for the carriers having a parabolic dispersion. We apply the
developed formalism to metallic single wall carbon nanotubes and obtain a
non-trivial non-monotonic dependence of the Seebeck coefficient on the chemical
potential. We emphasize that, in contrast to the Mott's formula, the classical
Kelvin's formula that links thermoelectric power to the temperature derivative
of the chemical potential is perfectly valid in carbon nanotubes in the
ballistic regime. Interestingly, however, the Kelvin's formula fails in two-
and three-dimensional systems in the ballistic regime.

<br>
<i>S. I. Mistakidis, K. Mukherjee, S. M. Reimann, H. R. Sadeghpour</i>
<p>The tunneling dynamics of a magnetic $^{164}$Dy quantum gas in an elongated
or circular skewed double-well trap is investigated with a time-dependent
extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Upon lifting the energy offset, different
tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently
large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic
tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through
the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to
tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for
increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for
large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the circular
trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid
density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns
in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new
ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet
regimes.

<i>Jieling Tan, Jiang-Jing Wang, Hang-Ming Zhang, Han-Yi Zhang, Heming Li, Yu Wang, Yuxing Zhou, Volker L. Deringer, Wei Zhang</i>
<p>Main-group chalcogenides with layered crystal structures and high in-plane
anisotropy are attracting increasing interest for a range of practical
applications. The III-VI semiconductor, monoclinic gallium monotelluride
(m-GaTe), has been recently used in high-sensitivity
photodetectors/phototransistors and electronic memory applications due to its
anisotropic properties yielding superior optical and electrical performance.
Despite these applications, the origin of such anisotropy, namely the complex
structural and bonding environments in GaTe nanostructures remain to be fully
understood. In the present work, we report a comprehensive atomic-scale
characterization of m-GaTe by state-of-the-art element-resolved atomic-scale
microscopy experiments. By performing imaging for two different view
directions, we are able to directly measure the in-plane anisotropy of m-GaTe
at the sub-Angstrom level, and show that it compares well with the results of
first-principles modeling. Quantum-chemical bonding analyses provide a detailed
picture of the atomic neighbor interactions within the layers, revealing that
vertical Ga-Ga homopolar bonds get stronger when they are distorted and
rotated, inducing the strong in-plane anisotropy.

<p>Unraveling the structural factors influencing the dynamics of amorphous
solids is crucial. While deep learning aids in navigating these complexities,
transparency issues persist. Inspired by the successful application of
prototype neural networks in the field of image analysis, this study introduces
a new machine-learning approach to tackle the interpretability challenges faced
in glassy research. Distinguishing from traditional machine learning models
that only predict dynamics from the structural input, the adapted neural
network additionally tries to learn structural prototypes under various dynamic
patterns in the training phase. Such learned structural constraints can serve
as a breakthrough in explaining how structural differences impact dynamics. We
further use the proposed model to explore the correlation between the local
structure and activation energy in the CuZr metallic glass. Building upon this
interpretable model, we demonstrated significant structural differences among
particles with distinct activation energies. The insights gained from this
analysis serve as a data-driven solution for unraveling the origins of the
structural heterogeneity in amorphous alloys, offering a valuable contribution
to the understanding the amorphous materials.

state-of-the-art Poisson solvers of the TIE, and hence significantly increases

<i>Shunsuke Kitou, Masaki Gen, Yuiga Nakamura, Yusuke Tokunaga, Taka-hisa Arima</i>
<p>Transition-metal atoms with d electrons sometimes form clusters in crystals,
which significantly affects the physical properties. Such a cluster formation
frequently accompanies a change in the crystal system, leading to the presence
of domains with different crystal orientations. In particular, the cubic
symmetry is rarely retained after the cluster formation. Here, we identify a
cubic-to-cubic phase transition in lacunar spinel GaNb$_4$Se$_8$, where the
change in the lattice parameter is less than 0.0001%. Each Nb$^{3.25+}$
tetramer with seven 4d electrons is distorted into a Nb$^{3+}$ trimer and a
Nb$^{4+}$ monomer induced by charge disproportionation among Nb ions. While the
Nb$^{3+}$ trimer with six 4d electrons forms spin-singlets in the sigma-bonding
orbitals for three Nb-Nb bonds, a localized S=1/2 spin remains on the Nb$^{4+}$
ion. Furthermore, a local electric dipole moment is induced along the
three-fold rotation axis of each distorted tetramer by the cluster
rearrangement. The electric dipole moments are regularly arranged to maintain
the cubic symmetry, giving rise to chiral order.

<p>Mesh-like structures, such as mucus gel or cytoskeleton networks, are
ubiquitous in biological systems. These intricate structures are composed of
cross-linked, semi-flexible bio-filaments, crucial to numerous biological
processes. In many biological systems, active self-propelled particles like
motor proteins or bacteria navigate these intricate polymer networks.In this
study, we develop a computational model of three-dimensional cubic-topological,
swollen polymer networks of semi-flexible filaments. We perform Langevin
dynamics simulations to investigate the diffusion of active tracer particles
navigating through these networks. By analyzing various physical observables,
we investigate the effects of mesh-to-particle size ratio, P\'eclet number of
active particles, and bending stiffness of the polymer networks upon active
trapped-and-hopping diffusion of the tracer. When the tracer size is equal to
or larger than the mesh size, the polymer stiffness substantially enhances
trapping while suppressing the hopping process. Notably, the mean trapped time
exhibits an exponential growth law to the bending stiffness with an
activity-dependent slope. An analytic theory based on the mean first-passage
time of active particles in a harmonic potential is developed. Our findings
deepen the comprehension of the intricate interplay between the polymer's
bending stiffness, tracer size, and the activity of tracer particles. This
knowledge can shed light on important biological processes, such as
motor-driven cargo transport or drug delivery, which hinge on the behavior of
active particles within biological gels.

<p>Efficient scattering into the exciton polariton ground state is a key
prerequisite for generating Bose-Einstein condensates and low-threshold
polariton lasing. However, this can be challenging to achieve at low densities
due to the polariton bottleneck effect that impedes phonon-driven scattering
into low-momentum polariton states. The rich exciton landscape of transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provides potential intervalley scattering pathways
via dark excitons to rapidly populate these polaritons. Here, we present a
microscopic study exploring the time- and momentum-resolved relaxation of
exciton polaritons supported by a \ce{MoSe2} monolayer integrated within a
Fabry-Perot cavity. By exploiting phonon-assisted transitions between
momentum-dark excitons and the lower polariton branch, we demonstrate that it
is possible to circumvent the bottleneck region and efficiently populate the
polariton ground state. Furthermore, this intervalley pathway is predicted to
give rise to, yet unobserved, angle-resolved phonon sidebands in
low-temperature photoluminescence spectra that are associated with
momentum-dark excitons. This represents a distinctive experimental signature
for efficient phonon-mediated polariton-dark-exciton interactions.

<p>Devising effective platinum (Pt)-free nanomaterials for catalyzing oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) is desired, but some main drawbacks still exist for
commercial implementation in fuel cell systems. Herein, we present the
preparation of gold (Au)-modified palladium (Pd) thin films with various
thicknesses of Au using magnetron sputtering deposition. It is found that the
prepared Au-modified Pd (Au/Pd) thin films with some desirable characteristics
such as large electrochemical surface area (ECSA), improved electron transfer,
along with high catalytical active positions reveal markedly boosted
electro-catalytic activity and stability for oxygen reduction in acidic
environments compared with pure Pd catalyst. Noticeably, the as-deposited Au/Pd
thin films exhibit a connection in oxygen reduction ability as a function of Au
thickness, with the 0.16 nm Au/Pd thin film being the best ORR sample.
Significantly, 0.16 nm Au/Pd material demonstrates superior stability after
1000 potential cycles in comparison with the 0.16 nm Pt/Pd owing to the
influence of Au modification as well as its structurally stable surfaces.

<p>The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) is a standard method for
studying solids and molecules, it is also known as the tight$-$binding (TB)
method. In most of the implementations only the basis set and the coupling
constants are provided, without the explicit definition of kinetic and
potential energy operators. The tight$-$binding scheme is, nonetheless, capable
of providing an accurate description of properties such as the electronic bands
and elastic constants for many materials. However, for some applications, the
knowledge of the underlying electronic potential associated with the
tight$-$binding hamiltonian might be important to guarantee that the actual
physics is preserved by the semiempirical scheme. In this work the electronic
potentials that arise from the use of tight$-$binding effective hamiltonians it
is explored. The formalism is applied to the extended H\"{u}ckel
tight$-$binding (EHTB) hamiltonian, which is a two$-$center Slater$-$Koster
approach that makes explicit use of the overlap matrix.

<h3>Lattice thermal conductivity of ZrSe2 based on the anharmonic phonon  approach and on-the-fly machine learning force fields</h3>

<br>
<i>Yong Lu, Fawei Zheng</i>
<p>The lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) of ZrSe$_2$, a typical layered
transition metal disulfide, has been calculated using a hybrid approach that
combines force field molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE). In this approach, the phonon quasiparticle picture of each
normal mode can be obtained directly by the velocity autocorrelation function
and its power spectrum projected in $q$-space. By employing the retarded one
phonon Green's function method, the phonon quasiparticle frequency and lifetime
of each independent normal mode are effectively determined. On-the-fly machine
learning force fields combine the precision of quantum mechanics and the scale
of classical MD to analyze sizable supercells with long-wavelength phonons.
This yields accurate LTC by using sufficient $q$-samples in the Brillouin zone,
which cannot be achieved at the \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics scale. The
convergent LTC tensor of bulk and monolayer ZrSe$_2$ decays faster with
increasing temperature than the well-known $\frac{1}{T}$ scale, which is
typically observed when considering only three-phonon scattering. The phonon
lifetime and mean free path exhibit significant dependence on temperature. MD
simulations encompass all orders of anharmonic effects, thereby enabling an
accurate description of anharmonic interactions between phonons at finite
temperatures. Moreover, this approach respects the contribution of each normal
mode to the LTC based on the BTE, which facilitates the quantitative analysis
of phonon anharmonic properties and the role of specific normal modes.

<p>The theoretical calculation of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation
with matter remains a challenging problem for contemporary $ab$ $initio$
electronic structure methods, in particular for x-ray spectroscopies. This is
not only due to the strong interaction between the core-hole and the
photo-excited electron, but also due to the elusive multiplet effects that
arise from the Coulomb interaction among the valence electrons. In this work we
report a method based on density-functional theory in conjunction with
multiplet ligand-field theory to investigate various core-level spectroscopies,
in particular x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD). The developed computational scheme is applied to the
$L_{2,3}$ XAS edges of magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$) as well as cobalt ferrite
(CoFe$_2$O$_4$) and nickel ferrite (NiFe$_2$O$_4$) and the corresponding XMCD
spectra. The results are in overall good agreement with experimental
observations, both regarding the XAS $L_2$/$L_3$ branching ratio, the peak
positions as well as the relative intensities. The agreement between theory and
experiment is equally good for XAS and the XMCD spectra, for all studied
systems. The results are analyzed in terms of $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ orbitals
contributions and the importance of optimizing the Slater parameters. The
analysis also highlights the strong effect of the $2p$-$3d$ interaction in

not form any regular structure and are not fixed, unlike in solids. Instead,
they are allowed to diffuse and this is why liquids can flow. However, this
diffusive motion is characterized by much longer time scales compared to those
of solid-like oscillations. Although this general picture is not particularly
new, only in a recent series of works it has been possible to construct a
coherent and internally consistent {\it quantitative} description of transport
properties such as self-diffusion, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity.
Moreover, the magnitudes of these transport coefficients have been related to
the properties of collective excitations in dense fluids. Importantly, the
model is simple and no free parameters are involved. Recent achievements are
summarized in this overview. Application of the vibrational model to various
single-component model systems such as plasma-related Coulomb and screened
Coulomb (Yukawa) fluids, the Lennard-Jones fluid, and the hard-sphere fluid is
considered in detail. Applications to real liquids are also briefly discussed.
Overall, good to excellent agreement with available numerical and experimental
data is demonstrated. Conditions of applicability of the vibrational model and
a related question concerning the location of the gas-liquid crossover are
discussed.

<i>Jiahuan Ren, Teng Long, Chunling Gu, Hongbing Fu, Dmitry Solnyshkov, Guillaume Malpuech, Qing Liao</i>
<p>Topological polaritons, combining the robustness of the topological protected
edge states to defects and disorder with the strong nonlinear properties of
polariton bosons, represent an excellent platform to investigate novel photonic
topological phases. In this work, we demonstrated the optical spin Hall effect
(OSHE) and its symmetry switching in the exciton-polariton regime of pure
DPAVBi crystals. Benefiting from the photonic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coupling in organic crystals, we observed the separation of left- and
right-circularly-polarized polariton emission in two-dimensional momentum space
and real space, a signature of the OSHE. Above the lasing threshold, the OSHE
pattern changes due to transverse quantization in the microbelt. This device
without superlattice structure has great potential applications in topological
polaritonics, such as information transmission, photonic integrated chips and
quantum information.

<i>A. Mayorgas, M. Calixto, N.A. Cordero, E. Romera, O. Casta√±os</i>
<p>The time evolution of a wave packet is a tool to detect topological phase
transitions in two-dimensional Dirac materials, such as graphene and silicene.
Here we extend the analysis to HgTe/CdTe quantum wells and study the evolution
of their electron current wave packet, using 2D effective Dirac Hamiltonians
and different layer thicknesses. We show that the two different periodicities
that appear in this temporal evolution reach a minimum near the critical
thickness, where the system goes from normal to inverted regime. Moreover, the
maximum of the electron current amplitude changes with the layer thickness,
identifying that current maxima reach their higher value at the critical
thickness. Thus, we can characterize the topological phase transitions in terms
of the periodicity and amplitude of the electron currents.

<h3>Inference of Time-Reversal Asymmetry from Time Series in a Piezoelectric  Energy Harvester</h3>

<br>
<i>L. Costanzo, A. Baldassarri, A. Lo Schiavo, A. Sarracino, M. Vitelli</i>
<p>We consider the problem of assessing the non-equilibrium behavior of a system
from the study of time series. In particular, we analyze experimental data from
a piezoelectric energy harvester driven by broadband random vibrations where
the extracted power and the relative tip displacement can be simultaneously
measured. We compute autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of these
quantities in order to investigate the system properties under time reversal.
We support our findings with numerical simulations of a linear underdamped
Langevin equation, which very well describes the dynamics and fluctuations of
the energy harvester. Our study shows that, due to the linearity of the system,
from the analysis of a single variable, it is not possible to evidence the
non-equilibrium nature of the dynamics. On the other hand, when
cross-correlations are considered, the irreversible nature of the dynamics can
be revealed.

<h3>Temperature-induced miscibility of impurities in trapped Bose gases</h3>

<br>
<i>G. Pascual, T. Wasak, A. Negretti, G. E. Astrakharchik, J. Boronat</i>
<p>We study the thermal properties of impurities embedded in a repulsive Bose
gas under a harmonic trapping potential. In order to obtain exact structural
properties in this inhomogeneous many-body system, we resort to the
path-integral Monte Carlo method. We find that, at low temperatures, a single
impurity is expelled to the edges of the bath cloud if the impurity-boson
coupling constant is larger than the boson-boson one. However, when the
temperature is increased, but still in the Bose-condensed phase, the impurity
occupies the core of the trap and, thus, the system becomes miscible. This
thermal-induced miscibility transition is also observed for a finite
concentration of impurities in this inhomogeneous system. We find that the
transition temperature for miscibility depends on the impurity-boson
interaction and we indicate a novel nondestructive method to measure the
temperature of a system based on the studied phenomenon.

<h3>Self-similar and Universal Dynamics in Drainage of Mobile Soap Films</h3>

<i>Antoine Monier, Fran√ßois-Xavier Gauci, Cyrille Claudet, Franck Celestini, Christophe Brouzet, Christophe Raufaste</i>
<p>Vertical soap films drain under the influence of gravity, as indicated by the
downward motion of colorful horizontal interference fringes observed on their
surfaces. In this study conducted with rectangular soap films, we
experimentally characterize the descent dynamics of these isothickness fringes
and report its self-similar nature. We also show that this result is equivalent
to thickness profiles exhibiting a separation of space and time. By integrating
new measurements with data from the literature across various conditions, we
validate these properties and establish the universality of the dynamics,
governed by a single physical scalar. Our findings provide new insights for
proposing a drainage model and understanding the mechanism of marginal
regeneration at the origin of the process.

<h3>Harvesting nucleating structures in nanoparticle crystallization: The  example of gold, silver and iron</h3>

<br>
<i>Arthur France-Lanord, Sarath Menon, Julien Lam</i>
<p>The thermodynamics and kinetics of crystallization of nanoparticles, as
opposed to bulk phases, may be influenced by surface and size effects. We
investigate the importance of such factors in the crystallization process of
gold, silver, and iron nanodroplets using numerical simulations in the form of
molecular dynamics combined with path sampling. This modeling strategy is
targeted at obtaining representative ensembles of structures located at the
transition state of the crystallization process. A structural analysis of the
transition state ensembles reveals that both the average size and location of
the critical nucleation cluster are influenced by surface and nanoscale size
effets. Furthermore, we also show that transition state structures in smaller
nanodroplets exhibit a more ordered liquid phase, and differentiating between a
well-ordered critical cluster and its surrounding disordered liquid phase
becomes less evident. All in all, these findings demonstrate that
crystallization mechanisms in nanoparticles go beyond the assumptions of
classical nucleation theory.

<h3>Influence of Core Substitution on the Electronic Structure of  Benzobisthiadiazoles</h3>

<i>Mohsen Ajdari, Ronja Pappenberger, Caja Annweiler, Tobias Kaczun, Leon Mueller, Larissa Winkelmann, Lukas Ahrens, Uwe H. F. Bunz, Andreas Dreuw, Petra Tegeder</i>
<p>Benzobisthiadiazoles (BBTs) are promising organic semiconductors for
applications in field effect transistors and solar cells, since they possess a
strong electron-accepting character. Thereby the electronic structure of
organic/metal interfaces and within thin films is essential for the performance
of organic electronic devices. Here, we study the structural and the electronic
properties of two BBTs, with different core substitution pattern, a phenyl
(BBT-Ph) and thiophene (BBT-Th) derivative adsorbed on Au(111) using
vibrational and electronic high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy in
combination with state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations. In the mono-
and multilayer both BBTs adopt a planar adsorption geometry with the molecular
backbone as well as the phenyl and thiophene side groups are oriented parallel
to the gold substrate. The energies of the lowest excited electronic singlet
states and the first triplet state (T1) are determined. The optical gap is
found to be 2.2 eV for BBT-Ph and 1.6 eV for BBT-Th. The energy of T1 is
identified to be 1.2 eV in BBT-Ph and in the case of BBT-Th 0.7 eV. Thus, both
the optical gap size as well as the T1 energy are drastically reduced in BBT-Th
compared to BBT-Ph. Based on our quantum chemical calculations this is
attributed to the electron-rich nature of the five-membered thiophene rings in
conjunction with their preference for planar geometries. Variation of the
substitution pattern in BBTs opens the opportunity for tailoring their
electronic properties.

<h3>Room-Temperature Plasmon-Assisted Resonant THz Detection in Single-layer  Graphene Transistors</h3>

<p>Frequency-selective or even frequency-tunable Terahertz (THz) photodevices
are critical components for many technological applications that require
nanoscale manipulation, control and confinement of light. Within this context,
gate-tunable phototransistors based on plasmonic resonances are often regarded
as the most promising devices for frequency-selective detection of THz fields.
The exploitation of constructive interference of plasma waves in such detectors
not only promises frequency selectivity, but also a pronounced sensitivity
enhancement at the target frequencies. However, clear signatures of
plasmon-assisted resonances in THz detectors have been only revealed at
cryogenic temperatures so far, and remain unobserved at application-relevant
room-temperature conditions. In this work, we demonstrate the sought-after
room-temperature resonant detection of THz radiation in short-channel gated
photodetectors made from high-quality single-layer graphene. The survival of
this intriguing resonant regime at room-temperature ultimately relies on the
weak intrinsic electron-phonon scattering in graphene, which avoids the damping
of the plasma oscillations.

<h3>Unveiling multi-quantum excitonic correlations in push-pull polymer  semiconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Yulong Zheng, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Myeongyeon Lee, Elsa Reichmanis, Carlos Silva-Acu√±a</i>
<p>Bound and unbound Frenkel-exciton pairs are essential transient precursors
for a variety of photophysical and biochemical processes, such as
exciton-exciton annihilation, singlet fission, polariton condensation, and
biological light harvesting. In this work, we identify bound and unbound
{Frenkel}-exciton complexes in an electron push-pull polymer semiconductor
using coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy. We find that the dominant
$A_{0-1}$ peak of the absorption vibronic progression is accompanied by a
sub-peak, which we ascribe to excitons dressed by distinct vibrational modes.
By considering the Liouville pathways within a two-exciton model, the
two-dimensional cross-peak structure in one-quantum rephasing and non-rephasing
spectra can be accounted for by the presence of pure biexcitons. The
two-quantum non-rephasing spectra, on the other hand, provide direct evidence
for biexcitons and unbound exciton pairs. We find that the binding force is
dominantly attractive with a weak repulsive feature, resolved along the
two-quantum axis. In addition, the spectral features of unbound exciton pairs
show mixed absorptive and dispersive character, implying many-body interactions
within the correlated {Frenkel}-exciton pairs. Our work offers novel
perspectives on Frenkel exciton complexes, which undoubtedly play a significant
role in the rich photophysical processes found in conjugated semiconductor
materials.

<h3>Optically Helicity-Dependent Orbital and Spin Dynamics in  Two-Dimensional Ferromagnets</h3>

<i>Shuo Li, Ran Wang, Thomas Frauenheim, Junjie He</i>
<p>Disentangling orbital (OAM) and spin (SAM) angular momenta in the ultrafast
spin dynamics of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets on subfemtoseconds is a
challenge in the field of ultrafast magnetism. Herein, we employed
non-collinear spin version of real-time time-dependent density functional
theory to investigate the orbital and spin dynamics of 2D ferromagnets Fe3GeTe2
(FGT) induced by circularly polarized light. Our results show the
demagnetization of Fe sublattice in FGT is accompanied by helicity-dependent
precession of OAM and SAM excited by circularly polarized lasers. We further
identify that precession of OAM and SAM in FGT is faster than the
demagnetization within a few femtoseconds. Remarkably, circularly polarized
lasers can significantly induce a periodically transverse response of OAM and
SAM on very ultrafast timescales of ~250 attoseconds. Our finding suggests a
powerful new route for attosecond regimes of the angular momentum manipulation
to coherently control helicity-dependent orbital and spin dynamics in 2D
limits.

<h3>Second-order phase transitions and divergent linear response in  dynamical mean-field theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04042</a>
<br>
<i>Erik G. C. P. van Loon</i>
<p>Second-order phase transitions appear as a divergence in one of the linear
response functions. For a system of correlated electrons, the relevant
divergent response can and does involve many-particle observables, most
famously the double occupancy. Generally, evaluating the linear response
function of many-particle observables requires a many-particle generalization
of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. However, here I show that the divergence of
linear response functions in dynamical mean-field theory is governed by a
two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equation, even for many-particle observables. The
reason for this is that the divergence at the second-order phase transition is
produced by the self-consistent feedback of the dynamical mean-field.

<h3>Self-organization of active colloids mediated by chemical interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04043" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04043</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiwei Peng, Raymond Kapral</i>
<p>Self-propelled colloidal particles exhibit rich non-equilibrium phenomena and
have promising applications in fields such as drug delivery and self-assembled
active materials. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown that
chemically active colloids that consume or produce a chemical can self-organize
into clusters with diverse characteristics depending on the effective phoretic
interactions. In this paper, we investigate self-organization in systems with
multiple chemical species that undergo a network of reactions and multiple
colloidal species that participate in different reactions. Active colloids
propelled by complex chemical reactions with potentially nonlinear kinetics can
be realized using enzymatic reactions that occur on the surface of
enzyme-coated particles. To demonstrate how the self-organizing behavior
depends on the chemical reactions active colloids catalyze and their chemical
environment, we consider first a single type of colloid undergoing a simple
catalytic reaction, and compare this often-studied case with self-organization
in binary mixtures of colloids with sequential reactions, and binary mixtures
with nonlinear autocatalytic reactions. Our results show that in general active
colloids at low particle densities can form localized clusters in the presence
of bulk chemical reactions and phoretic attractions. The characteristics of the
clusters, however, depend on the reaction kinetics in the bulk and on the
particles and phoretic coefficients. With one or two chemical species that only
undergo surface reactions, the space for possible self-organizations are
limited. By considering the additional system parameters that enter the
chemical reaction network involving reactions on the colloids and in the fluid,
the design space of colloidal self-organization can be enlarged, leading to a
variety of non-equilibrium structures.

<p>High-throughput computational materials discovery has promised significant
acceleration of the design and discovery of new materials for many years.
Despite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by
large-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck.
Furthermore, examples of large-scale computational discovery carried through
experimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product
applicability. Here we demonstrate how this vision became reality by first
combining state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models and traditional
physics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to
quickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around
half a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state
electrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further
identified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a
decade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. By
employing around one thousand virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, this process
took less than 80 hours. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized
the structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the
Na$_x$Li$_{3-x}$YCl$_6$ ($0 < x < 3$) series, demonstrating the potential of
these compounds to serve as solid electrolytes. Additional candidate materials
that are currently under experimental investigation could offer more examples
of the computational discovery of new phases of Li- and Na-conducting solid
electrolytes. We believe that this unprecedented approach of synergistically
integrating AI models and cloud HPC not only accelerates materials discovery
but also showcases the potency of AI-guided experimentation in unlocking
transformative scientific breakthroughs with real-world applications.

<h3>Microwave-assisted synthesis of LaMnO3+d: Tuning physical properties  with microwave power</h3>

<br>
<i>Marimuthu Manikandan, Arup Ghosh, Ramanathan Mahendiran</i>
<p>Synthesis of transition metal oxides by microwave irradiation is a faster and
energy-saving method compared to conventional heating in an electrical furnace
because microwave energy is directly converted into heat within precursors.
However, not much is known about how the physical properties are modified by
the power of microwaves. We synthesized LaMnO3+d by irradiating oxide
precursors with microwaves and studied the impact of microwave power (P = 1000
W, 1200 W, 1400 W and 1600 W) on magnetism, resistivity, magnetoresistance,
thermopower, magnetic entropy change, magnetostriction, and electron spin
resonance. It is found that paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition becomes
sharper, saturation magnetization increases, and electrical resistivity at low
temperatures dramatically decreases as P increases. While the resistivity of
samples irradiated with MW power of P less than or equal to 1400 W show
insulating-like behavior down to 50 K, an insulator-metal transition occurs in
the sample exposed to P = 1600 W and this sample also shows a maximum
magnetoresistance (= -55%), magneto-thermopower (=-87%), magnetostriction (-180
x10-6) for H = 50 kOe and magnetic entropy change of 4.78 J/kg. K for H = 30
kOe around the Curie temperature. The intensity of electron spin resonance
spectra at 300 K increases with P. We postulate that the much enhanced physical
properties observed for the P = 1600 W sample arise from the creation of higher
hole density, chemical homogeneity, and increased grain size. Our study shows
that microwave power can be used as a knob to tune magnetism and other physical
properties to our advantage.

<h3>From anti-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in a dislocation-obstacle  bypass: Atomistic Simulations and Theoretical Investigation</h3>

<i>Mohammadhossein Nahavandian, Soumit Sarkar, Soumendu Bagchi, Danny Perez, Enrique Martinez</i>
<p>Dislocations are the primary carriers of plasticity in metallic material.
Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to
predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations,
we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate
for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic
loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows
a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature
increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional
Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along
the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the
cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected
Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free
energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence
with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be
considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic
barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress. More work needs to be
performed to fully understand the discrepancies between Schoeck's and PAFI
results compared to molecular dynamics.

<br>
<i>Giuseppe Baio, Magnus O. Borgh</i>
<p>We show that energy relaxation causes a point defect in the uniaxial-nematic
phase of a spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensate to deform into a spin-Alice ring
that exhibits a composite core structure with distinct topology at short and
long distances from the singular line. An outer biaxial-nematic core exhibits a
spin half-quantum vortex structure with a uniaxial-nematic inner core. By
numerical simulation we demonstrate a dynamical oscillation between the
spin-Alice ring and a split-core hedgehog configuration via the appearance of
ferromagnetic rings with associated vorticity inside an extended core region.
We further show that a similar dynamics is exhibited by a spin-Alice ring
surrounding a spin-vortex line resulting from the relaxation of a monopole
situated on a spin-vortex line in the biaxial-nematic phase. In the cyclic
phase similar states are shown instead to form extended phase-mixing cores
containing rings with fractional mass circulation or cores whose spatial shape
reflect the order-parameter symmetry of cyclic inner core, depending on the
initial configuration.

<h3>Geometric inhibition of superflow in single-layer graphene suggests a  staggered-flux superconductivity in bilayer and trilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04106</a>
<br>
<i>Xinyao Zhang, Ruoshi Jiang, Xingchen Shen, Xiaomo Huang, Qing-Dong Jiang, Wei Ku</i>
<p>In great contrast to the numerous discoveries of superconductivity in
layer-stacked graphene systems, the absence of superconductivity in the
simplest and cleanest monolayer graphene remains a big puzzle. Here, through
realistic computation of electronic structure, we identify a systematic trend
that superconductivity appears to emerge only upon alteration of the low-energy
electronic lattice from the underlying honeycomb atomic structure. We then
demonstrate that this inhibition can result from from geometric frustration of
the bond lattice that disables quantum phase coherence of the order parameter
residing on it. In comparison, upon deviating from the honeycomb lattice,
relief of geometric frustration allows robust superfluidity with non-trivial
spatial structure. For the specific examples of bilayer and trilayer graphene
under an external electric field, such bond centered order parameter would
develop superfluidity with staggered flux that breaks the time-reversal
symmetry. Our study also suggests the possible realization of the long-sought
superconductivity in single-layer graphene via the application of
uni-directional strain.
