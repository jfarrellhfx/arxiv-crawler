<h3>Modulating magnetic and electronic properties of lead-apatite  Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O via different transition metal doping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16711</a>

<br>
<br>
Based on the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we
investigate the magnetic and electronic properties of transition-metal-doped
Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O with the Pb atom substituted by various transition
metals. The $3d$ orbitals of the doped transition metals are distributed near
the Fermi energy and exhibit strong spin-polarization, resulting in the local
magnetic moment. With the doped metal varying from V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu,
to Zn, the moment changes gradually from 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, to
0 $\mu_B$, while the electronic structure is modulated progressively due to the
continuous change of total charge. Moreover, the flat bands near the Fermi
energy are also found in the V, Cr, and Fe-doped lead-apatite, similar to the
Cu-doped system. Our work not only provides the critical comparative
information for investigating the Cu-doped lead-apatite, but also suggest a
category of diluted magnetic semiconductor.

<h3>Surface plasmon-polaritons in graphene, embedded into medium with gain  and losses</h3>

<br>
<br>
The paper deals with the theoretical consideration of surface
plasmon-polaritons in the graphene monolayer, embedded into dielectric with
spatially separated gain and losses. It is demonstrated, that presence of gain
and losses in the system leads to the formation of additional mode of graphene
surface plasmon-polaritons, which does not have its counterpart in the
conservative system. When the gain and losses are mutually balanced, the
position of exceptional point -- transition point between unbroken and broken
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry -- can be effectively tuned by graphene's doping. In
the case of unbalanced gain and losses the spectrum of surface
plasmon-polaritons contains spectral singularity, whose frequency is also
adjustable through the electrostatic gating of graphene.

Recent experimental realization of the heteronuclear dipolar mixture of Dy
and Er atoms opens fascinating prospects for creating intriguing novel phases
in dipolar quantum gases. The experimentally measured value of intra-species
$s$-wave scattering length of $^{166}$Er condensate in a $^{164}$Dy-$^{166}$Er
mixture is larger than its intra-species dipolar length, implies that the
$^{166}$Er condensate itself will not be in a regime of dominated dipole-dipole
interaction (DDI). However, we find that the presence of $^{164}$Dy atoms with
high magnetic moment induces droplet nucleation and supersolidity in $^{166}$Er
condensate via the long-range and anisotropic inter-species DDI. Remarkably, we
find that the imbalance in the magnetic dipole moment combined with its strong
anisotropic coupling led to the emergence of unique ground state phases. The
emerging phases include doubly superfluid states, a mixture of insulating
droplets and supersolid states, binary supersolids with uniform and alternating
domains and a combination of supersolid-superfluid mixed states. We delineate
the properties of all these ground state phases and construct a phase diagram.
We also explore the dynamical evolution across these phase boundaries via a
linear quench of inter-species scattering length. Although we have demonstrated
the result for the $^{164}$Dy-$^{166}$Er mixture, our results are generally
valid for other dipolar bosonic mixtures of different Dy-Er isotope
combinations and may become an important benchmark for future experimental
scenarios.

<h3>Extraordinary physical properties of superconducting  YBa$_{1.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$Cu$_3$O$_6$Se$_{0.51}$ in a multiphase ceramic material</h3>

We report on a novel material obtained by modifying pristine YBCO
superconductor in solid phase synthesis via simultaneous partial substitution
of Ba by Sr and O by Se. Simultaneous application of EDX and EBSD confirmed
that Se atoms indeed enter the crystalline lattice cell. The detailed XRD
analysis further confirmed this conclusion and revealed that the obtained
polycrystalline material contains 5 phases, with the major phase ($>$30\%)
being a cuprate YBa$_{1.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6}$Se$% _{0.51}$. The obtained
superconductor demonstrates unique properties, including i) two superconducting
transitions with $T_{c1}\approx$ 35 K (granular surface phase) and
$T_{c2}\approx$ 13 K (bulk granular phase) - this granular phase arrangement
naturally yields the Wohlleben effect; ii) reentrant diamagnetism and resistive
state; iii) strong paramagnetism with Curie-Weiss behavior (% $\theta_{CW}
\approx$ 4 K) and the ferromagnetic phase overruled by superconductivity; iv)
Schottky anomaly visible in the heat capacity data and most likely delivered by
small clusters of magnetic moments. Thorough analysis of the heat capacity data
reveals a strong-coupling $d-$wave pairing in its bulk phase (with $2\Delta
/T_{c}\approx 5$), and, most importantly, a very unusual anomaly in this
cuprate. There are reasons to associate this anomaly with the quantum
criticality observed in traditional cuprate superconductors at much higher
fields (achievable only in certain laboratories). In our case, the fields
leading to quantum criticality are much weaker ($\sim $7-9 T) thus opening
avenues for exploration of the interplay between superconductivity and pair
density waves by the wider research community.

<h3>Twist Angle Dependence of Exciton Resonances in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ Moiré  Heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Van der Waals heterostructures based on TMDC semiconducting materials have
emerged as promising materials due to their spin-valley properties efficiently
contrived by the stacking-twist angle. The twist angle drastically alters the
interlayer excitonic response by determining the spatial modulation, confining
moir\'e potential, and atomic reconstruction in those systems. Nonetheless, the
impact of the interlayer twist angle on the band alignment of the monolayers
composing the heterostructure has received scant attention in the current
research. Here, we systematically investigate the twist-angle dependence of
intra- and inter-layer excitons in twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers. By
performing photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, we identify the
twist-angle dependence of interlayer emission response, where an energy
redshift of about 100 meV was observed for increasing twist angles. The applied
microscopic theory predicts, on the contrary, a blueshift, which suggests that
additional features, such as atomic reconstruction, may also surpass the
moir\'e potential confinement. Those findings also prompt the effects of
dielectric screening by addressing the redshift response to the stacking layer
order. Furthermore, our findings support the evidence of a band offset
dependence on the twist angle for the adjacent monolayers composing the
heterobilayer system. Our fundamental study of exciton resonances deepens the
current understanding of the physics of twisted TMDC heterostructures and paves
the way for future experiments and theoretical works.

<h3>Solution landscapes of ferronematics in microfluidic channels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16841</a>

<i>James Dalby</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate solution landscapes for ferronematics i.e., a dilute
suspension of magnetic nano-particles in a nematic liquid crystal host, in a
reduced one-dimensional setting relevant for microfluidic problems. Solution
landscapes show how critical points of an energy functional connect to one
another on the energy landscape, hence revealing potential mechanism by which
multistable systems may switch between different stable states. By varying
model parameters, we show that increasing domain size and increasing
nemato-magnetic coupling have the same impact on the solution landscape, in
that both result in new emergent solutions. Hence, this presents multiple
avenues for experimental realisation of multistable ferronematic systems with
desired properties. We also show the prevalence, and therefore importance, of
ferronematic polydomains, which present themselves as what we call order
reconstruction (OR) solutions. These ferronematic OR solutions possess a great
deal of complexity in terms of the location and multiplicity of domain walls,
and also play a key role in the connectivity of stable states for the solution
landscapes considered.

<h3>Nanowire Breakup via a Morphological Instability Enhanced by Surface  Electromigration</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16879</a>

<i>Mikhail Khenner</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a recent continuum model of a single-crystal nanowire morphological
evolution in the applied axial electric field, an axisymmetric evolution of a
microscopically rough nanowire surface is computed. Morphological evolution
results in a wire breakup into a cylindrical segments (particles). Breakup time
and the number of particles are characterized for various levels of the radial
and axial surface roughness. It is shown that electromigration and larger
surface roughness lead to a shorter breakup time and the increased number of
particles.

substrate at atomic scale using electron microscopy and spectroscopy. We detect
~1 nm MgO between MgB$_2$ and SiC. Atomic-level electron energy loss spectra
(EELS) show MgB$_2$-E2g mode splitting and softening near the MgB$_2$/MgO
interface. Orbital-resolved core-level EELS link the phonon softening to
in-plane boron-atom electron states' changes. Ab initio calculations confirm
this softening enhances electron-phonon coupling at the interface. Our findings

<h3>Muon Spin Relaxation Study of frustrated Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$ with  kagomé lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
The structure and magnetic properties of rare-earth ions Tm$^{3+}$ kagom\'{e}
lattice Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$ are studied by X-ray diffraction, magnetic
susceptibility and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) experiments. The existence of
a small amount of Tm/Mg site-mixing disorder is revealed. DC magnetic
susceptibility measurement shows that Tm$^{3+}$ magnetic moments are
antiferromagnetically correlated with a negative Curie-Weiss temperature of
-26.3 K. Neither long-range magnetic order nor spin-glass transition is
observed by DC and AC magnetic susceptibility, and confirmed by $\mu$SR
experiment down to 0.1 K. However, the emergence of short-range magnetic order
is indicated by the zero-field $\mu$SR experiments, and the absence of spin
dynamics at low temperatures is evidenced by the longitudinal-field $\mu$SR
technique. Compared with the results of Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$, another
Tm-based kagom\'{e} lattice with much more site-mixing disorder, the gapless
spin liquid like behaviors in Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$ can be induced by
disorder effect. Samples with perfect geometrical frustration are in urgent
demand to establish whether QSL exits in this kind of materials with rare-earth
kagom\'{e} lattice.

<h3>Superconducting Properties of La$_2$(Cu$_{1-x}$Ni_x)$_5$As$_3$O$_2$: A  $\rm μ$SR Study</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report the results of muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\rm \mu$SR)
measurements on the recently discovered layered Cu-based superconducting
material La$_{2}($Cu$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{5}$As$_{3}$O$_{2}$ ($x =$ 0.40, 0.45).
Transverse-field $\rm \mu$SR experiments on both samples show that the
temperature dependence of superfluid density is best described by a two-band
model. The absolute values of zero-temperature magnetic penetration depth
$\lambda_{\rm ab}(0)$ were found to be 427(1.7) nm and 422(1.5) nm for $x =$
0.40 and 0.45, respectively. Both compounds are located between the
unconventional and the standard BCS superconductors in the Uemura plot. No
evidence of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in the superconducting state
is suggested by zero-field $\rm \mu$SR measurements.

<h3>Evidence for an odd-parity nematic phase above the charge density wave  transition in kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The quest for fascinating quantum states arising from the interplay between
correlation, frustration, and topology is at the forefront of condensed-matter
physics. Recently discovered nonmagnetic kagome metals $A$V${_3}$Sb${_5}$ ($A=$
K, Cs, Rb) with charge density wave (CDW) and superconducting instabilities may
host such exotic states. Here we report that an odd electronic nematic state
emerges above the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}=94$ K) in
CsV${_3}$Sb${_5}$. High-resolution torque measurements reveal a distinct
twofold in-plane magnetic anisotropy that breaks the crystal rotational
symmetry below $T^*\approx130$ K. However, no relevant anomalies are detected
in the elastoresistance data near $T^*$, which excludes the even-parity
ferro-orbital nematicity often found in other superconductors. Moreover, in the
temperature range between $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T^*$, conical rotations of
magnetic field yield a distinct first-order phase transition, indicative of
time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results provide thermodynamic evidence
for the emergence of an odd-parity nematic order, implying that an exotic
loop-current state precedes the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

<h3>A slime mold inspired local adaptive mechanism for flow networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the realm of biological flow networks, the ability to dynamically adjust
to varying demands is paramount. Drawing inspiration from the remarkable
adaptability of Physarum polycephalum, we present a novel physical mechanism
tailored to optimize flow networks. Central to our approach is the principle
that each network component -- specifically, the tubes -- harnesses locally
available information to collectively minimize a global cost function. Our
findings underscore the scalability of this mechanism, making it feasible for
larger, more complex networks. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram,
pinpointing the specific network parameters under which successful adaptation,
or tuning, is realized. There exists a phase boundary in the phase diagram,
revealing a distinct satisfiability-unsatisfiability (SAT-UNSAT) phase
transition delineating successful and unsuccessful adaptation.

<h3>Magnetism, transport and atomic structure of amorphous binary YxCo1-x  alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sputtered thin films of binary YxCo1-x with 0 < x < 0.54 and thickness 15 nm
are investigated to help understand the ferromagnetism of cobalt in amorphous
rare-earth cobalt alloys. The magnetic moment per cobalt falls to zero at x0 =
0.50, where the appearance of magnetism is marked by a para-process with a
dimensionless susceptibility of up to 0.015. All films are magnetically soft,
with densities that fall between those of crystalline Y-Co intermetallic
compounds and the density of a relaxed 10,000-atom binary random close-packed
model of hard spheres with an Y:Co volume ratio of 3:1, where the packing
fractions for all films lies in a narrow range around 0.633 and Co is
coordinated by 3.2 Co and 3.2 Y atoms at x = 0.5. All films with x < 0.4
exhibit in-plane shape anisotropy that is about six times as great as an
intrinsic perpendicular component. Average cobalt spin and orbital moments
obtained by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism were 1.31 and 0.32 Bohr
magnetons, respectively for amorphous Y0.25Co0.75. Strong local anisotropy is
associated with the large cobalt orbital moment, but there is little influence
of anisotropy on the ferromagnetic order because of exchange averaging. The
Hall effect and magnetoresistance are modelled in terms of effective uniform
rotation of the magnetization, with spontaneous and band contributions.
Amorphous YxCo1-x is contrasted with amorphous YxFe1-x, which exhibits random
noncollinear magnetic order that is very sensitive to the film density.

Stochastically fluctuating multi-well systems as physical implementations of
energy-based machine learning models promise a route towards neuromorphic
hardware. Understanding the response of multi-well systems to dynamic input
signals is crucial in this regard. Here, we investigate the stochastic response
of binary orbital memory states derived from individual Fe and Co atoms on a
black phosphorus surface to sinusoidal input voltages. Using scanning tunneling
microscopy, we quantify the state residence times for DC and AC voltage drive
with various input frequencies. We find that Fe and Co atoms both exhibit
features of synchronization to the AC input, but only Fe atoms demonstrate a
significant frequency-dependent change in the time-averaged state occupations.
By modeling the underlying stochastic process, we show that the frequency
response of the system is directly related to the DC voltage dependence of the
state asymmetry. This relation provides a tunable way to induce population
changes in stochastic systems and lays the foundation for understanding the
response of multi-well systems to dynamical input signals.

<h3>Energy minimization of paired composite fermion wave functions in the  spherical geometry</h3>

We perform the energy minimization of the paired composite fermion (CF) wave
functions, proposed by M\"oller and Simon (MS) [PRB 77, 075319 (2008)] and
extended by Yutushui and Mross (YM) [PRB 102, 195153 (2020)], where the energy
is minimized by varying the CF pairing function, in the case of an approximate
model of the Coulomb interaction in the second Landau level for pairing
channels $\ell = -1, 3, 1$ which are expected to be in the Pfaffian,
anti-Pfaffian and particle-hole symmetric (PH) Pfaffian phases respectively. It
is found that the energy of the $\ell = -1$ MS wave function can be reduced
substantially below that of the Moore-Read wave function at small system sizes,
however, in the $\ell = 3$ case the energy cannot be reduced much below that of
the YM trial wavefunction. Nonetheless, both our optimized and unoptimized
wavefunctions with $\ell=-1,3$ extrapolate to roughly the same energy per
particle in the thermodynamic limit. For the $\ell = 1$ case, the optimization
makes no qualitative difference and these PH-Pfaffian wave functions are still
energetically unfavourable. The effective CF pairing is analyzed in the
resulting wave functions, where the effective pairing for the $\ell = -1, 3$
channels is found to be well approximated by a weak-pairing BCS ansatz and the
$\ell = 1$ wave functions show no sign of emergent CF pairing.

<br>
We investigated the effects of laser irradiation on sessile droplets of three
well-known liquid crystalline 12 materials (5CB, 8CB, E7) deposited on the
surface of an iron-doped lithium niobate (LN:Fe) crystal. The static electric
13 field, which is generated via the bulk photovoltaic effect in the LN:Fe
substrate, produces the merging of smaller 14 droplets into filaments oriented
in the radial direction with respect to the laser spot. It also induces
filament jetting 15 from the rim of larger droplets toward the center of the
illumination area. When the laser beam is focused directly 16 onto the larger
droplets, they abruptly disintegrate via the formation of several jet streams.
The described effects are 17 present in the nematic and also in the isotropic
phase. We attribute them to a large gradient of the surface electric field 18
that produces driving forces via the induced dipole moments of the droplets,
analogous to electric field-based droplets 19 transport mechanisms known for
standard dielectric liquids.

<h3>Simulations of Nanocrystalline Iron Formation under High Shear Strain</h3>

High-shear methods have long been used in experiments to refine grain
structures in metals, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We
demonstrate a refinement process using molecular dynamic simulations, wherein
nanocrystalline structures are generated from initially perfect lattices under
high-shear strain. The simulation cells undergo a highly disordered state,
followed by recrystallization and grain coarsening, resulting in nanograins. We
explore the dependence on parameters such as temperature, heat dissipation
rate, shear strain rate, and carbon impurity concentration. Higher temperatures
lead to the formation of larger and longer grains. The faster heat dissipation
sample initially yields more small grains, but their number subsequently
reduces, and is lower than the slower heat dissipation sample at approximately
1.5 strain. Slower strain rates do not promote nanograin formation. The
presence of carbon impurities appears to have little effect on grain formation.
This detailed analysis affords insight into the mechanisms that control the
formation of nanograins under high-shear conditions.

<h3>Supersolid formation time shortcut and excitation reduction by  manipulating the dynamical instability</h3>

Supersolids are a phase of matter exhibiting both superfluidity and a
periodic density modulation typical of crystals. When formed via quantum phase
transition from a superfluid, they require a formation time before their
density pattern develops. Along this paper some protocols/schemes are proposed
for experimental applications, building on earlier descriptions of the role
roton instability plays in the supersolid formation process and the associated
formation time. In particular, the Parachutejump scheme sought to lessen the
excitation produced when crossing the phase transition, and the Bang-Bang
method sought to shorten the formation time. As a case study of the impact that
mechanical fluctuations (noise) can have on the phase transition when
conducting an experiment, the impact of a mechanical kick before the transition
is also investigated. The proposed schemes are able to fulfill their objectives
successfully as both the shortening of the formation process and the reduction
of excitation are achieved within the framework of extended Gross Pitaevskii
theory.

In the second part of this publication, we present simulation results for two
three-dimensional models of Heusler-type alloys obtained by the mesoscopic
micromagnetic approach. In the first model, we simulate the magnetization
reversal of a single ferromagnetic (FM) inclusion within a monocrystalline
antiferromagnetic (AFM) matrix, revealing the evolution of the complex
magnetization distribution within this inclusion when the external field is
changed. The main result of this ``monocrystalline'' model is the absence of
any hysteretic behavior by the magnetization reversal of the FM inclusion.
Hence, this model is unable to reproduce the basic experimental result for the
corresponding nanocomposite -- hysteresis in the magnetization reversal of FM
inclusions with a vertical shift of the corresponding loops. To explain this
latter feature, in the second model we introduce a polycrystalline AFM matrix,
with exchange interactions between AFM crystallites and between the FM
inclusion and these crystallites. We show that within this model we can not
only reproduce the hysteretic character of the remagnetization process, but
also achieve a semi-quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed
hysteresis loop assuming that the concentration of FM inclusions strongly
fluctuates. These findings demonstrate the reliability of our enhanced
micromagnetic model and set the basis for its applications in future studies of
Heusler alloys and FM/AFM nanocomposites.

antiferromagnetic phases. Starting with the atomistic modeling of quasi
one-dimensional systems, we explicitly show how the material parameters for the
mesoscopic model of an antiferromagnet can be derived. The comparison between
magnetization profiles obtained in atomistic and mesoscopic calculations (using
a Heusler alloy as an example) proves the validity of our method. This approach
opens up the possibility to recover the details of the magnetization
distribution in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic materials with the resolution
of a few nanometers covering length scales up to several hundreds of
nanometers.

In percolation theory, the general scenario for the supercritical phase is
that all clusters, except the unique giant one, are small and the two-point
correlation exponentially decays to some constant. We show by extensive
simulations that the whole supercritical phase of the three-dimensional uniform
forest model simultaneously exhibits an infinite tree and a rich variety of
critical phenomena. Besides typical scalings like algebraically decaying
correlation, power-law distribution of cluster sizes, and divergent correlation
length, a number of anomalous behaviors emerge. The fractal dimensions for
off-giant trees take different values when being measured by linear system size
or gyration radius. The giant tree size displays two-length scaling
fluctuations, instead of following the central-limit theorem. In a non-Gaussian
fermionic field theory, these unusual properties are closely related to the
non-abelian continuous OSP$(1|2)$ supersymmetry in the fermionic hyperbolic
plane ${\mathbb H}^{0|2}$.

Mg is currently the only p-type dopant in technological use in GaN. Its
incorporation into the GaN lattice is difficult. It requires a thermal
treatment that only partially activates the Mg. To achieve moderate p-type
doping requires high doses of Mg that mostly remain inactive. High p-type
doping is thus typically achieved at the cost of certain lattice distortion and
the creation of defects. Using low-temperature surface photovoltage
spectroscopy, we obtain a wide spectrum of optical transitions within the
bandgap of Mg-doped GaN. The results reveal an optical transition from the
valence band into a deep trap around 0.49 eV above the valence band, along with
what appears to be a complimentary transition from the same trap into the
conduction band observed at 2.84 eV (coinciding with the energy of the famous
Mg-related GaN blue luminescence). The similar shape of the spectra, their
complimentary energies within the GaN gap and their opposite nature (hole vs.
electron trap) appear to be more than a coincidence suggesting that this is an
Mg-related surface state. The density of charge we calculate for this surface
state is about 2x1012 cm-2. We suggest that these small amounts of
surface-segregated Mg partially oxidize during the growth and further oxidize
during the consecutive Mg-activation heat treatment. This minute quantity of
oxidized surface Mg should be about enough to form an Mg-related surface state.
Etching the GaN with H3PO4 is shown to affect the photovoltage at the
blue-luminescence-related energy. Finally, we show that pure MgO powder
produces the same blue luminescence even at the absolute absence of GaN.

<h3>Understanding the optical properties of doped and undoped 9-armchair  graphene nanoribbons in dispersion</h3>

<br>
<br>
Graphene nanoribbons are one-dimensional stripes of graphene with width- and
edge-structure-dependent electronic properties. They can be synthesized
bottom-up in solution to obtain precise ribbon geometries. Here we investigate
the optical properties of solution-synthesized 9-armchair graphene nanoribbons
(9-aGNRs) that are stabilized as dispersions in organic solvents and further
fractioned by liquid cascade centrifugation (LCC). Absorption and
photoluminescence spectroscopy reveal two near-infrared absorption and emission
peaks whose ratios depend on the LCC fraction. Low-temperature
single-nanoribbon photoluminescence spectra suggest the presence of two
different nanoribbon species. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and
time-dependent DFT calculations, the lowest energy transition can be assigned
to pristine 9-aGNRs, while 9-aGNRs with edge-defects, caused by incomplete
graphitization, result in more blue-shifted transitions and higher Raman
D/G-mode ratios. Hole doping of 9-aGNR dispersions with the electron acceptor
F4TCNQ leads to concentration dependent bleaching and quenching of the main
absorption and emission bands and the appearance of redshifted, charge-induced
absorption features but no additional emission peaks, thus indicating the
formation of polarons instead of the predicted trions (charged excitons) in
doped 9-aGNRs.

<h3>Spin- and valley-dependent transports through ferromagnetic 8-pmmn  borophene monolayer</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study spin and valley-dependent transport properties in an n-p-n junction
of 8-pmmn borophene monolayer. An external gate voltage and exchange magnetic
field, induced by the proximity effect of a ferromagnetic insulator, are
applied to this junction as electric and magnetic potential barriers. We show
that the exchange magnetic field generates spin polarization in the system and
applying a gate voltage, as a simple method, causes valley polarization. This
property (valley polarization) is due to the anisotropic and tilted Dirac cones
of the borophene structure. It is an advantage of borophene monolayer over
graphene monolayer because in graphene it is necessary to apply strain to have
valley polarization. We also show that the proposed device (borophene-based
n-p-n junction) can work as perfect spin and perfect valley filters. The spin
and valley filters can be controlled by changing two factors, i.e. gate voltage
and Fermi energy. Moreover, it is shown that for full spin and valley
polarizations and thus perfect spin and valley filters, the length of the
barriers must be larger than a specific value (60nm). These results show that
the borophene monolayer has a suitable potential to be used in spintronic and
valleytronic devices.

<h3>Planar thermal Hall effect from phonons in a Kitaev candidate material</h3>

Kitaev materials are a promising platform for the realization of quantum spin
liquid states. The thermal Hall effect has emerged as a potential probe of
exotic excitations within such states. In the Kitaev candidate material
$\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, however, the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ has
been attributed not only to exotic Majorana fermions or chiral magnons, but
also to phonons. It has been shown theoretically that the former two types of
heat carriers can generate a ''planar'' thermal Hall effect, whereby the
magnetic field is parallel to the heat current, as observed experimentally, but
it is unknown whether phonons also could. Here we show that a planar thermal
Hall effect is present in another Kitaev candidate material,
Na$_{2}$Co$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$. On the basis of a striking similarity between the
temperature and field dependence of $\kappa_{xy}$ and that of the
phonon-dominated thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$, we argue that the planar
thermal Hall effect in Na$_{2}$Co$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ is generated by phonons. The
phonon contributed planar $\kappa_{xy}$ also shows a strong sample dependence,
which indicates an extrinsic origin of the mechanism. By conducting a complete
study with different in-plane configurations of heat current $J$ and magnetic
field $H$, $i.e.$ $H$ $\|$ $J$ and $H$ $\bot$ $J$, we observe a large
difference in $\kappa_{xy}$ between these two configurations, which reveals
that the direction of the heat current $J$ may play an important role in
determining the planar thermal Hall effect. Our observation calls for a
re-evaluation of the planar thermal Hall effect observed in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.

<h3>Electronic structure and magnetic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$  under pressure</h3>

<i>Harrison LaBollita, Victor Pardo, Michael R. Norman, Antia S. Botana</i>
<br>
<br>
Following the recent report of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure, we present an analysis of the
electronic and magnetic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as a function of
pressure using correlated density functional theory methods (DFT+$U$). At the
bare DFT level, the electronic structure of the ambient and high-pressure phase
of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ is qualitatively similar. Upon including local
correlation effects within DFT+$U$ and allowing for magnetic ordering, we find
a delicate interplay between pressure and electronic correlations. Within the
pressure-correlations phase space, we identify a region (at $U$ values
consistent with constrained RPA calculations) characterized by a spin-state
transition with increasing pressure, where the ground state of
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ changes from a high-spin A-type antiferromagnet to a
low-spin G-type antiferromagnet with contrasting electronic structures. While
the energy landscape of this material is rich, with many competing magnetic
states, we find a common thread to be that all of these different states are
driven by the Ni-$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals.

<h3>Is orbital ordering in crystals a magnetic phase transition?</h3>

<i>Khisa Borlakov, Alexandr Meremianin, Dalkhat Ediev, Amina Borlakova</i>
<br>
<br>
The paper demonstrates that during a phase transition associated with orbital
ordering in a crystal containing Jan-Teller ions, the symmetry with respect to
the time inversion operation is broken, and this transition is magnetic. The
study is conducted on the example of spinel crystals containing T2g ions. We
consider spinels, where orbital ordering occurs initially, followed by spin
ordering at lower temperatures. Based on the symmetry group of the parent
phase, symmetry groups of possible orbital-ordered and spin-ordered phases are
identified. The transition from spin ordering at lower temperatures is
organically integrated into the general group-theoretical scheme. It is shown
that orbital ordering occurs due to superexchange between Jan-Teller ions,
while spin ordering is driven by spin-orbit interaction. Atomic displacements
in the coordination polyhedron are not the cause of lifting orbital degeneracy.

We study two-body correlations in a spin-balanced ultracold harmonically
trapped Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms in the crossover from the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to the Bose-Einstein-Condensate (BEC) regime.
For this, we precisely measure Tan's contact using a novel method based on
photoexcitation of atomic pairs, which was recently proposed by Wang et al.
[Phys. Rev. A 104 063309 (2021)]. We map out the contact in the entire phase
diagram of the BCS-BEC crossover for various temperatures and interaction
strengths, probing regions in phase-space that have not been investigated yet.
Our measurements reach an uncertainty of $\approx 2 \%$ and thus represent a
precise quantitative benchmark. We compare our data to theoretical predictions
and interpolations and localize the regions in phase space where the latter
give valid results. In regions where the contact is already well known we find
excellent agreement with our measurements. Thus, our results demonstrate that
photoinduced loss is a precise probe to measure quantum correlations in a
strongly interacting Fermi gas.

<h3>Wegner model in high dimension: U(1) symmetry breaking and a  non-standard phase of disordered electronic matter, I. One-replica theory</h3>

The Anderson transition between localized and metallic states is
traditionally analyzed by assuming a one-parameter scaling hypothesis. Although
that hypothesis has been confirmed near two dimensions by epsilon = d-2
expansion of the Wegner-Efetov nonlinear sigma model, there exists mounting
evidence that the transition in d=3 or higher may have a second branch and that
two relevant parameters are needed in order to describe the universal behavior
at criticality. Doubt of the standard hypothesis also comes from field theory.
Indeed, increasing the space dimension pushes the Anderson transition towards
strong disorder, where a strong-coupling approach very different from the usual
weak-coupling analysis of the sigma model is called for. In the present work,
we develop a novel field theory of Anderson transitions at strong coupling
based on the key observation that the U(1) symmetry which distinguishes
retarded from advanced fields may undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking. That
symmetry breakdown splits the sigma model coupling into two, thus leading to a
natural scenario of two-parameter scaling. While we develop the field theory
from the concrete starting point of the Wegner N-orbital model, we believe our
results to be of much wider applicability. The first of a series, the present
paper offers a pedagogical introduction to the main ideas in the setting of the
one-replica theory. Subsequent papers will employ the self-consistent
approximation of Abou-Chacra et al. and develop the full supersymmetric theory.
The latter establishes the existence of a new renormalization-group fixed
point, whose basin of attraction constitutes a third phase of disordered
electronic matter.

Inelastic scattering processes typically introduce friction among carriers
and reduce the transport properties of photons, phonons, and electrons.
However, we predict that in contrast to the role in reducing thermal
conductivity, four-phonon scattering dominates near-field radiative heat
transfer (NFRHT) in both boron arsenide~(BAs) and boron antimonide. Including
four-phonon scattering results in a nearly 400-fold increase in the total heat
flux between two BAs thin-films compared to three-phonon scattering alone. This
non-intuitive enhancement arises from the large number of NFRHT channels
activated by four-phonon scattering outcompete the effect of decreased coupling
strength of surface phonon polaritons at the resonance frequency. Additionally,
we point out that four-phonon scattering to decrease NFRHT in certain other
systems.

Recent quantum gas experiments are ushering in an era of fine-tailored
two-body interactions. These include for example atoms with long-range
dipole-dipole interactions and Rydberg-dressed atoms created by optical
coupling to highly excited electronic states. These systems differ from the
``canonical system" of cold atoms with contact interactions characterized by a
single parameter, the scattering length. Inspired by these experiments with
controllable atomic interactions, here we consider a model many-body system of
spinless Fermi gas in two dimensions, where the bare two-body interaction takes
the form of a soft-core disk potential. We show that the repulsive interaction
can drive the system to a series of nontrivial superfluid states with higher
partial wave paring, for example in the $f$- and $h$-wave channels instead of
the $p$-wave channel. The zero temperature phase diagram is obtained by
numerical functional renormalization group (FRG), which goes beyond leading
order perturbation theory and retains the interaction vertices in all channels.
We also carry out a perturbative analysis which is justified in the dilute
limit and show that the second order Kohn-Luttinger diagrams provide a
qualitative understanding of the onsets of the various superfluid phases. The
perturbative arguments however fail to capture the quantitative phase
boundaries predicted by FRG. Our findings illustrate that the shape of the bare
atomic interaction matters in producing the pairing glue in repulsive Fermi
gases, and tuning the interaction potential offers a promising route to realize
exotic many-body phases in cold atomic gases.

Doping is the most common strategy employed in the development of new and
improved materials. However, predicting the effects of doping on the
atomic-scale structure of a material is often difficult or limited to high-end
experimental techniques. Doping can induce phase separation in a material,
undermining the material's stability. A further complication is that dopant
atoms can segregate to interfaces in a material such as grain boundaries (GBs),
with consequences for key macroscopic properties of the material such as its
conductivity. Here, we describe a computational methodology based on semi-grand
canonical Monte Carlo which can be used to probe these phenomena at the atomic
scale for metal oxide solid solutions. The methodology can provide precise
predictions of the thermodynamic conditions at which phase separation occurs.
It can also provide the segregation patterns exhibited by GBs at given
conditions. We apply the methodology to one of the most important catalytic
materials, ceria-zirconia. Our calculations reveal an interesting richness in
the GB segregation in this system. Most GBs we examined exhibited continuous
increases in Zr segregation upon Zr doping, with a concomitant reduction in the
formation enthalpies of the GBs. However, a few GBs exhibited no segregation at
low temperatures. We also observed evidence of first-order complexion
transitions in some GBs.

<h3>Misconceptions about quantifying animal encounter and interaction  processes</h3>

Quantifying animal interactions is crucial for understanding various
ecological processes, including social community structures, predator-prey
dynamics, spreading of pathogens and information. Despite the ubiquity of
interaction processes among animals and the advancements in tracking
technologies enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple individuals, a common
theoretical framework to analyse movement data is still lacking. The diverse
mechanisms governing how organisms perceive the proximity of others have led to
species-specific theoretical approaches, hindering a common currency with which
to evaluate and compare findings across taxa. We propose a general framework,
borrowing tools from statistical physics, specifically from the theory of
reaction diffusion processes. While some of these tools have been employed to
predict pathogen transmission events, they have not yet pervaded the movement
ecology literature. Using both continuous and discrete variables, we
demonstrate the suitability of our framework to study interaction processes.
Defining interactions as the transfer of information between individuals, we
show that the probability of information transfer for the first time is
equivalent to the first-passage probability of reacting in a multi-target
environment. As interaction events reduce to encounter events for perfectly
efficient information transfer, we compare our formalism to a recent approach
that takes the joint occupation probability of two animals over a region of
interaction as a measure of the encounter probability, rather than the
first-encounter probability. We show the discrepancy between the two approaches
by comparing analytically their predictions with continuous variables, while
with discrete variables we quantify their difference over time. We conclude by
pointing to some of the open problems that reaction diffusion formalism might
be able to tackle.

We synthesized polycrystalline La3Ni2O7 samples by using the sol-gel method
without post-annealing under high oxygen pressure, and then measured
temperature-dependent resistivity under various hydrostatic pressures up to

anomaly in resistivity is suppressed gradually by pressure and the resistivity
drop corresponding to the onset of superconductivity emerges at pressure as low
as 7 GPa. Zero resistivity can be achieved at 9 GPa below 5 K, which increases
quickly with pressure to 35.6 K at 14.5 GPa. The observation of zero-resistance
state in the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7 samples under high pressures not only
elaborates the recent report of superconductivity in the pressurized La3Ni2O7
crystals but also facilitates more studies on this new family of nickelate

carrying mass or spin circulation that connect across interfaces between
biaxial- and uniaxial nematic, cyclic and ferromagnetic phases, as well as
vortices terminating as monopoles on the interface ("boojums"). The
biaxial-nematic and cyclic phases exhibit discrete polytope symmetries
featuring non-Abelian vortices and we investigate a pair of non-commuting line
defects within the context of a topological interface. By numerical
simulations, we characterize the emergence of non-trivial defect core
structures, including the formation of composite defects. Our results
demonstrate the potential of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates as experimentally
accessible platforms for exploring interface physics, offering a wealth of

The study of fractional Chern insulators and their exotic anyonic excitations
poses a major challenge in current experimental and theoretical research.
Quantum simulators, in particular ultracold atoms in optical lattices, provide
a promising platform to realize, manipulate, and understand such systems with a
high degree of controllability. Recently, an atomic $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state
has been realized experimentally for a small system of two particles on 4 by 4
sites. The next challenge concerns the preparation of Laughlin states in
extended systems, ultimately giving access to anyonic braiding statistics or
gapless chiral edge-states in systems with open boundaries. Here, we propose
and analyze an experimentally feasible scheme to grow larger Laughlin states by
connecting multiple copies of the already existing 4-by-4-system. First, we
present a minimal setting obtained by coupling two of such patches, producing
an extended 8-by-4-system with four particles. Then, we analyze different
preparation schemes, setting the focus on two shapes for the extended system,
and discuss their respective advantages: While growing strip-like lattices
could give experimental access to the central charge, square-like geometries
are advantageous for creating quasi-hole excitations in view of braiding
protocols. We highlight the robust quantization of the fractional quasi-hole
charge upon using our preparation protocol. We benchmark the performance of our
patchwork preparation scheme by comparing it to a protocol based on coupling
one-dimensional chains. We find that the patchwork approach consistently gives
higher target-state fidelities, especially for elongated systems. The results
presented here pave the way towards near-term implementations of extended
Laughlin states in quantum gas microscopes and the subsequent exploration of
exotic properties of topologically ordered systems in experiments.

Defects such as grain boundaries (GBs) are almost inevitable during the
synthesis process of 2D materials. To take advantage of the fascinating
properties of 2D materials, understanding the nature and impact of various GB
structures on the pristine 2D sheet is crucial. In this work, using an
evolutionary algorithm search, we predict a wide variety of silicene GB
structures with very different atomic structures compared to those found in
graphene or hexagonal boron-nitride. Twenty-one GBs with the lowest energy were
validated by density functional theory (DFT) - a majority of which were
previously unreported to our best knowledge. Based on the diversity of the GB
predictions, we found that the formation energy and mechanical properties can
be dramatically altered by adatoms positions within a GB and certain types of
atomic structures, such as four-atom rings. To study the mechanical behavior of
these GBs, we apply strain to the GB structures stepwise and use DFT
calculations to investigate the mechanical properties of 9 representative
structures. It is observed that GB structures based on pentagon-heptagon pairs
are likely to have similar or higher in-plane stiffness and strength compared
with the zigzag orientation of pristine silicene. However, an adatom located at
the hollow site of a heptagon ring can significantly deteriorate the mechanical
strength. For all the structures, the in-plane stiffness and strength were
found to decrease with increasing formation energy. For the failure behavior of
GB structures, it was found that GB structures based on pentagon-heptagon pairs
have failure behavior similar to graphene. We also found that the GB structures
with atoms positioned outside of the 2D plane tend to experience phase
transitions before failure. Utilizing the evolutionary algorithm, we locate
diverse silicene GBs and obtain useful information for their mechanical
properties.

The complex conductivity of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples representing
the optimally doped, the underdoped and the overdoped stoichiometry was
measured using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy. In the normal state, the
frequency dependence is described by the Drude model. Below the critical
temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$, the two-fluid model was successfully employed to
fit all the spectra, from 5 K up to $T_\mathrm{c}$. The temperature behaviour
of fundamental parameters such as the scattering time $\tau$, the superfluid
fraction $f_\mathrm{s}$ and the conductivity $\sigma$ was investigated at given
frequencies. The real part of the conductivity $\sigma_1(T)$ exhibits a
coherence-like peak at low frequencies, which slightly shifts with increasing
frequency whereas its height decreases. It can be observed for all three
stoichiometries and its exact shape depends on the quality of the sample. A
further analysis shows that this peak is a consequence of the competition
between the scattering time $\tau(T)$ and the superfluid fraction
$f_\mathrm{s}(T)$. The decrease of the superfluid fraction towards
$T_\mathrm{c}$ depends on the reduced temperature with a power law close to 2,
suggesting a dirty d-wave superconductor case for all levels of doping.

Two-dimensional dopant layers ($\delta$-layers) in semiconductors provide the
high-mobility electron liquids (2DELs) needed for nanoscale quantum-electronic
devices. Key parameters such as carrier densities, effective masses, and
confinement thicknesses for 2DELs have traditionally been extracted from
quantum magnetotransport. In principle, the parameters are immediately readable
from the one-electron spectral function that can be measured by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here, buried 2DEL $\delta$-layers in
silicon are measured with soft X-ray (SX) ARPES to obtain detailed information
about their filled conduction bands and extract device-relevant properties.
This study takes advantage of the larger probing depth and photon energy range
of SX-ARPES relative to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) ARPES to accurately measure
the $\delta$-layer electronic confinement. The measurements are made on
ambient-exposed samples and yield extremely thin ($\approx 1$ $nm$) and dense
($\approx$ $10^{14}$ $cm^2$) 2DELs. Critically, this method is used to show
that $\delta$-layers of arsenic exhibit better electronic confinement than
$\delta$-layers of phosphorus fabricated under identical conditions.

We prove a general inequality between the charge current and its fluctuations
valid for any non-interacting coherent electronic conductor and for any
stationary out-of-equilibrium condition, thereby going beyond established
fluctuation-dissipation relations. The developed fluctuation-dissipation bound
saturates at large temperature bias and reveals additional insight for heat
engines, since it limits the output power by power fluctuations. It is valid
when the thermodynamic uncertainty relations break down due to quantum effects
and provides stronger constraints close to thermovoltage.

The probability distribution of the maximum $M_t$ of a single resetting
Brownian motion (RBM) of duration $t$ and resetting rate $r$, properly centred
and scaled, is known to converge to the standard Gumbel distribution of the
classical extreme value theory. This Gumbel law describes the typical
fluctuations of $M_t$ around its average $\sim \ln (r t)$ for large $t$ on a
scale of $O(1)$. Here we compute the large-deviation tails of this distribution
when $M_t = O(t)$ and show that the large-deviation function has a singularity
where the second derivative is discontinuous, signalling a dynamical phase
transition. Then we consider a collection of independent RBMs with initial (and
resetting) positions uniformly distributed with a density $\rho$ over the
negative half-line. We show that the fluctuations in the initial positions of
the particles modify the distribution of $M_t$. The average over the initial
conditions can be performed in two different ways, in analogy with disordered
systems: (i) the annealed case where one averages over all possible initial
conditions and (ii) the quenched case where one considers only the
contributions coming from typical initial configurations. We show that in the
annealed case, the limiting distribution of the maximum is characterized by a
new scaling function, different from the Gumbel law but the large-deviation
function remains the same as in the single particle case. In contrast, for the
quenched case, the limiting (typical) distribution remains Gumbel but the
large-deviation behaviors are new and nontrivial. Our analytical results, both
for the typical as well as for the large-deviation regime of $M_t$, are
verified numerically with extremely high precision, down to $10^{-250}$ for the
probability density of $M_t$.

<h3>Local Changes in Protein Filament Properties Drive Large-Scale Membrane  Transformations Involved in Endosome Tethering and Fusion</h3>

Large-scale cellular transformations are triggered by subtle physical and
structural changes in individual biomacromolecular and membrane components. A
prototypical example of such an event is the orchestrated fusion of membranes
within an endosome that enables transport of cargo and processing of
biochemical moieties. In this work, we demonstrate how protein filaments on the
endosomal membrane surface can leverage a rigid-to-flexible transformation to
elicit a large-scale change in membrane flexibility to enable membrane fusion.
We develop a polymer field-theoretic model that captures molecular alignment
arising from nematic interactions with varying surface density and fraction of
flexible filaments, which are biologically controlled within the endosomal
membrane. We then predict the collective elasticity of the filament brush in
response to changes in the filament alignment, predicting a greater than
20-fold increase of the effective membrane elasticity over the bare membrane
elasticity that is triggered by filament alignment. These results show that the
endosome can modulate the filament properties to orchestrate membrane
fluidization that facilitates vesicle fusion, providing an example of how
active processes that modulate local molecular properties can result in
large-scale transformations that are essential to cellular survival.

The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE), the analog of the
fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field, is predicted to exist in
topological flat bands under spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking. The
demonstration of FQAHE could lead to non-Abelian anyons which form the basis of
topological quantum computation. So far, FQAHE has been observed only in
twisted MoTe2 (t-MoTe2) at moire filling factor v > 1/2. Graphene-based moire
superlattices are believed to host FQAHE with the potential advantage of
superior material quality and higher electron mobility. Here we report the
observation of integer and fractional QAH effects in a rhombohedral pentalayer
graphene/hBN moire superlattice. At zero magnetic field, we observed plateaus
of quantized Hall resistance Rxy = h/e^2 , 3h/(2e^2), 5h/(3e^2), 7h/(4e^2),
9h/(4e^2), 7h/(3e^2), 5h/(2e^2) at filling factors v = 1, 2/3, 3/5, 4/7, 4/9,
3/7 and 2/5 of the moire superlattice respectively. These features are
accompanied by clear dips in the longitudinal resistance Rxx at the same
filling factors and they correspond to states with Chern number C = v. In
addition, at zero magnetic field, Rxy = 2h/e^2 near v = 1/2 and it varies
linearly as the filling factor is tuned-similar to the composite Fermi liquid
(CFL) in the half-filled lowest Landau level at high magnetic fields. By tuning
the gate displacement field D and v, we observed phase transitions from CFL and
FQAHE to other correlated electron states. The rich family of FQAH states in
our high-quality graphene-based moire superlattice provides an ideal platform
for exploring charge fractionalization and (non-Abelian) anyonic braiding at
zero magnetic field, especially considering a lateral junction between FQAHE
and superconducting regions in the same graphene device.

The demonstration of magnetic ordering in two-dimensions has been one of the
recent milestones in low dimensional physics, raising a plethora of fundamental
questions, but also opening new opportunities to exploit the benefits of 2D
magnetism, especially in research fields such as spintronics or magnonics. To
this end, one of the main challenges for the device application of 2D magnets
is to increase the magnetic ordering temperatures. In the line of recent
experiments highlighting record-high Curie-temperatures well above 300K in
Fe5-xGeTe2, we present a thorough study of high-temperature ferromagnetism
using element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism in Fe5-xGeTe2 thin
films grown by molecular-beam epitaxy. We use both surface and bulk sensitive
X-ray measurement modes to corroborate that the magnetic signals persisting up
to 400K are of intrinsic nature. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of these
high Tc on the basis of high-resolution X-ray diffraction data which shows a
drastically higher Fe-site occupation at the upper boundaries of the Fe5-xGeTe2
unit cell, thus enhancing the interlayer magnetic interaction with compared to
the bulk counterparts.

<h3>The characteristics of LK-99 by Cu$_2$S removal using ammonia solution:  A diamagnetic semiconductor</h3>

In this study, we re-evaluated the superconducting properties of LK-99. The
LK-99 samples were synthesized using the process proposed by the original
Korean team. Additionally, we examined whether the results of the Korean team
are related to Cu$_2$S by using ammonia solution (NH$_3$-H$_2$O) to remove
Cu$_2$S . Through x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, a distinct Cu$_2$S phase
was identified in the LK-99 samples. A subsequent treatment using an ammonia
solution effectively eliminated this phase. The appearance of blue Cu$^{+2}$
ions in the solution and the elimination of the Cu$_2$S peak in XRD support the
conclusion. The magnetic and electrical properties of LK-99 with and without
Cu$_2$S postulate that the superconducting-like behavior in LK-99 predominantly
arises from a transition in resistivity due to the influence of Cu$_2$S . As
such, LK-99 is better classified as a diamagnetic semiconductor than a
room-temperature superconductor. The room-temperature superconductors still
require further research.
