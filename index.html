<h3>Wrinkling of fluid deformable surfaces</h3>

<p>Wrinkling instabilities of thin elastic sheets can be used to generate
periodic structures over a wide range of length scales. Viscosity of the thin
elastic sheet or its surrounding medium has been shown to be responsible for
dynamic processes. While this has been explored for solid as well as liquid
thin elastic sheets we here consider wrinkling of fluid deformable surfaces,
which show a solid-fluid duality and have been established as model systems for
biomembranes and cellular sheets. We use this hydrodynamic theory and
numerically explore the formation of wrinkles and their coarsening, either by a
continuous reduction of the enclosed volume or the continuous increase of the
surface area. Both lead to almost identical results for wrinkle formation and
the coarsening process, for which a universal scaling law for the wavenumber is
obtained for a broad range of surface viscosity and rate of change of volume or
area. However, for large Reynolds numbers and small changes in volume or area
wrinkling can be suppressed and surface hydrodynamics allows for global shape
changes following the minimal energy configurations of the Helfrich energy for
corresponding reduced volumes.

<h3>Diffusion of an Active Particle Bound to a Generalized Elastic Model:  Fractional Langevin Equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13457" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13457</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Taloni</i>
<p>We investigate the influence of a self-propelling, out-of-equilibrium active
particle on generalized elastic systems, including flexible and semiflexible
polymers, fluid membranes, and fluctuating interfaces, while accounting for
long-ranged hydrodynamic effects. We derive the fractional Langevin equation
governing the dynamics of the active particle, as well as that of any other
passive particle (or probe) bound to the elastic system. This equation
demonstrates analytically how the active particle dynamics is influenced by the
interplay of both the non-equilibrium force and of the viscoelastic
environment. Our study explores the diffusional behavior emerging for both the
active particle and a distant probe.The active particle undergoes three
different surprising and counterintuitive regimes identified by the distinct
dynamical time-scales: a pseudo-ballistic initial phase, a drastic decrease of
the mobility and an asymptotic subdiffusive regime.

<h3>Ordering kinetics in the active Ising model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13471" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13471</a>
<br>
<i>Sayam Bandyopadhyay, Swarnajit Chatterjee, Aditya Kumar Dutta, Mintu Karmakar, Heiko Rieger, Raja Paul</i>
<p>We undertake a numerical study of the ordering kinetics in the
two-dimensional $(2d)$ active Ising model (AIM), a discrete flocking model with
a non-conserved scalar order parameter. We find that for a quench into the
liquid-gas coexistence region and in the ordered liquid region, the
characteristic length scale of both the density and magnetization domains
follows the Lifshitz-Cahn-Allen (LCA) growth law: $R(t) \sim t^{1/2}$,
consistent with the growth law of passive systems with scalar order parameter
and non-conserved dynamics. The system morphology is analyzed with the
two-point correlation function and its Fourier transform, the structure factor,
which conforms to the well-known Porod's law, a manifestation of the coarsening
of compact domains with smooth boundaries. We also find the domain growth
exponent unaffected by different noise strengths and self-propulsion velocities
of the active particles. However, transverse diffusion is found to play the
most significant role in the growth kinetics of the AIM. We extract the same
growth exponent by solving the hydrodynamic equations of the AIM.

<h3>Liquid-crystal-like dynamic transition in ferroelectric/dielectric  superlattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13026</a>
<br>
<i>Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Mónica Graf, Javier Junquera, Jorge Íñiguez-González, Hugo Aramberri</i>
<p>Nanostructured ferroelectrics display exotic multidomain configurations
resulting from the electrostatic and elastic boundary conditions they are
subject to. While the ferroelectric domains appear frozen in experimental
images, atomistic second-principles studies suggest that they may become
spontaneously mobile upon heating, with the polar order {\sl melting} in a
liquid-like fashion. Here we run molecular dynamics simulations of model
systems (PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices) to study the unique features of
this transformation. Most notably, we find that the multidomain state looses
its translational and orientational orders at different temperatures,
resembling the behavior of liquid crystals and yielding an intermediate
hexatic-like phase. Our simulations reveal the mechanism responsible for the
melting and allow us to characterize the stochastic dynamics in the
hexatic-like phase: we find evidence that it is thermally activated, with
domain reorientation rates that grow from tens of gigahertzs to terahertzs in a
narrow temperature window.

<h3>Twisted Lattice Gauge Theory: Membrane Operators, Three-loop Braiding  and Topological Charge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13042</a>

<i>Joe Huxford, Yong Baek Kim, Dung Xuan Nguyen</i>
<p>3+1 dimensional topological phases can support loop-like excitations in
addition to point-like ones, allowing for non-trivial loop-loop and point-loop
braiding statistics not permitted to point-like excitations alone. Furthermore,
these loop-like excitations can be linked together, changing their properties.
In particular, this can lead to distinct three-loop braiding, involving two
loops undergoing an exchange process while linked to a third loop. In this
work, we investigate the loop-like excitations in a 3+1d Hamiltonian
realization of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory through direct construction of their
membrane operators, for a general finite Abelian group and 4-cocycle twist.
Using these membrane operators, we find the braiding relations and fusion rules
for the loop-like excitations, including those linked to another loop-like
excitation. Furthermore, we use these membrane operators to construct
projection operators that measure the topological charge and show that the
number of distinct topological charges measured by the 2-torus matches the
ground state degeneracy of the model on the 3-torus, explicitly confirming a
general expectation for topological phases. This direct construction of the
membrane operators sheds significant light on the key properties of the
loop-like excitations in 3+1 dimensional topological phases.

<h3>Hele-Shaw flow of a nematic liquid crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13061</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph R. L. Cousins, Nigel J. Mottram, Stephen K. Wilson</i>
<p>Motivated by the variety of applications in which nematic Hele-Shaw flow
occurs, a theoretical model for Hele-Shaw flow of a nematic liquid crystal is
formulated and analysed. We derive the thin-film Ericksen-Leslie equations that
govern nematic Hele-Shaw flow, and consider two important limiting cases in
which we can make significant analytical progress. Firstly, we consider the
leading-order problem in the limiting case in which elasticity effects dominate
viscous effects, and find that the nematic liquid crystal anchoring on the
plates leads to a fixed director field and an anisotropic patterned viscosity
that can be used to guide the flow of the nematic. Secondly, we consider the
leading-order problem in the opposite limiting case in which viscous effects
dominate elasticity effects, and find that the flow is identical to that of an
isotropic fluid and the behaviour of the director is determined by the flow. As
an example of the insight which can be gained by using the present approach, we
then consider the flow of nematic according to a simple model for the squeezing
stage of the One Drop Filling method, an important method for the manufacture
of Liquid Crystal Displays, in these two limiting cases.

<h3>Altermagnetism with Non-collinear Spins</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13069</a>
<br>
<i>Sang-Wook Cheong, Fei-Ting Huang</i>
<p>Altermagnetism is introduced as a category of magnetic states with vanishing
net magnetic moment, and consists of collinear alternating (i.e.,
antiferromagnetic-like) spins and alternating variations of local structures
around spins in such a way that the symmetry allows ferromagnetic behaviors
such as anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical Kerr effects. Altermagnets
exhibiting ferromagnetic behaviors without any external perturbations (called
type-I) turn out to belong to the ferromagnetic point group, and represent a
form of weak ferromagnetic states. Other altermagnets (called type-II and
type-III) can have ferromagnetic behaviors only with external perturbations,
which conserve parity-time reversal (PT) symmetry. All types of altermagnets
themselves have broken PT symmetry. The concept of altermagnetism can be
extended to accommodate multiple spin and local-structure variations (thus,
include non-collinear spins), and this extended form of altermagnetism offers
an intriguing opportunity to leverage complementary advantages of both
ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, and thus holds great promise for, for
example, various spintronic applications.

<h3>Nonreciprocal charge transport in the titanium sesquioxide  heterointerface superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13072</a>
<br>
<i>Peng Dong, Lijie Wang, Guanqun Zhang, Jiadian He, Yiwen Zhang, Yifan Ding, Xiaohui Zeng, Jinghui Wang, Xiang Zhou, Yueshen Wu, Wei Li, Jun Li</i>
<p>Nonreciprocal charge transport in heterostructural superconductors exhibits
appealing quantum physical phenomena and holds the promising potential for
superconducting circuits applications. Realizing a nonreciprocity is, however,
fundamentally and technologically challenging, as it requires a material
structure without a centre of inversion, which is scarce among superconducting
materials. Here, we report an evidence of helical superconductivity, in which
the Rashba spin-orbit coupling induces momentum-dependent superconducting gap
in the inversion symmetry breaking heterointerface superconductor consisting of
Mott insulating Ti$_2$O$_3$ and polar semiconducting GaN. Remarkably, the
nonlinear responses emerge in the superconducting transition regime, when the
magnetic field is precisely aligned in-plane orientations perpendicular to the
applied current. In particular, the observed nonreciprocal supercurrent is
extremely sensitive to the direction of the magnetic field for 0.5 degree,
suggestive of a crossover from a symmetry breaking state to a symmetric one.
Our finding not only unveils the underlying rich physical properties in
heterointerface superconductors, but also provides an exciting opportunity for
the development of novel mesoscopic superconducting devices.

<h3>Strain Solitons in an Epitaxially Strained van der Waals-like Material</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13080" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13080</a>
<br>
<i>Jason T. Dong, Hadass S. Inbar, Connor P. Dempsey, Aaron N. Engel, Christopher J. Palmstrøm</i>
<p>Strain solitons are quasi-dislocations that form in van der Waals materials
to relieve the energy associated with lattice or rotational mismatch in the
crystal. Novel and unusual electronic properties of strain solitons have been
both predicted and observed. To date, strain solitons have only been observed
in exfoliated crystals or mechanically strained bulk crystals. The lack of a
scalable approach towards the generation of strain solitons poses a significant
challenge in the study of and use of the properties of strain solitons. Here we
report the formation of strain solitons with epitaxial growth of bismuth on an
InSb (111)B substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. The morphology of the strain
solitons for films of varying thickness is characterized with scanning
tunneling microscopy and the local strain state is determined from the analysis
of atomic resolution images. Bending in the solitons is attributed due to
interactions with the interface, and large angle bending is associated with
edge dislocations. Our results enable the scalable generation of strain
solitons.

<h3>Thermal emissivity spectra and structural phase transitions of the  eutectic Mg-51%Zn alloy: A candidate for thermal energy storage</h3>

<p>The thermal emissivity spectrum in the mid infrared range (3 to 21 $\mu$m) as
well as its dependence on temperature between 225 and 320 $^{\circ}$C has been
obtained for the Mg-51%Zn (weight %) eutectic alloy, a candidate for thermal
storage. The spectral curves show the typical behaviour of metals and alloys,
with emissivity values between 0.05 and 0.2. It was also found that the
emissivity spectrum shows variations in each heating cycle during the first few
cycles. These changes are associated with the presence of metastable phases in
the solid solid phase transition, present in the alloy below the melting point.
The absence of signs of oxidation in air is very favourable for the use of this
alloy in thermal energy storage systems. Moreover, the total normal emissivity
curves obtained from dynamic spectral measurements have allowed analysing the
behaviour phase transition sequence present in this alloy. These experimental
results indicate that accurate emissivity measurements can be sensitive enough
to account for the structural phase transitions in metals and alloys.

<h3>On the existence of nematic-superconducting states in the  Ginzburg-Landau regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13106</a>
<br>
<i>Mariano De Leo, Juan Pablo Borgna, Diego García Ovalle</i>
<p>In this article, we investigate the existence of nematic-superconducting
states in the Ginzburg-Landau regime, both analytically and numerically. From
the configurations considered, a slab and a cylinder with a circular
cross-section, we demonstrate the existence of geometrical thresholds for the
obtention of non-zero nematic order parameters. Within the frame of this
constraint, the numerical calculations on the slab reveal that the competition
or collaboration between nematicity and superconductivity is a complex energy
minimization problem, requiring the accommodation of the Ginzburg-Landau
parameters of the decoupled individual systems, the sign of the bi-quadratic
potential energy relating both order parameters and the magnitude of the
applied magnetic field. Specifically, the numerical results show the existence
of a parameter regime for which it is possible to find mixed
nematic-superconducting states. These regimes depend strongly on both the
applied magnetic field and the potential coupling parameter. Since the proposed
model corresponds to the weak coupling regime, and since it is a condition on
these parameters, we design a test to decide whether this condition is
fulfilled.

<h3>Spinodal decomposition and domain coarsening in a multi-layer  Cahn-Hilliard model for lithium intercalation in graphite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13108</a>
<br>
<i>Antoine Cordoba, Marion Chandesris, Mathis Plapp</i>
<p>During the intercalation of lithium in layered host materials such as
graphite, lithium atoms can move within the plane between two neighboring
graphene sheets, but cannot cross the sheets. Repulsive interactions between
atoms in different layers lead to the existence of ordered phases called
"stages", with stage $n$ consisting of one filled layer out of $n$, the others
being empty. Such systems can be conveniently described by a multi-layer
Cahn-Hilliard model, which can be seen as a mean-field approximation of a
lattice-gas model with intra- and interlayer interactions between lithium
atoms. In this paper, the dynamics of stage formation after a rapid quench to
lower temperature is analyzed, both by a linear stability analysis and by
numerical simulation of the full equations. In particular, the competition
between stages 2 and 3 is studied in detail. The linear stability analysis
predicts that stage 2 always grows the fastest, even in the composition range
where stage 3 is the stable equilibrium state. This is borne out by the
numerical simulations, which show that stage 3 emerges only during the
non-linear coarsening of stage 2. Some consequences of this finding for the
charge-discharge dynamics of electrodes in batteries are briefly discussed.

<h3>Mid-infrared optical properties of pyrolytic boron nitride in the 390 to  1050 $^{\circ}$C temperature range using spectral emissivity measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13109" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13109</a>
<br>
<i>Iñigo González de Arrieta, Telmo Echániz, Raquel Fuente, Leire del Campo, Domingos De Sousa Meneses, Gabriel Alejandro López, Manuel José Tello</i>
<p>This paper shows a systematic experimental and theoretical study on the
temperature dependence of the infrared optical properties of pyrolytic boron
nitride (pBN), from 390 to 1050 $^{\circ}$CC for wavelengths between 4 and 16
{\mu}m. The temperature dependence of these properties has never been analyzed
before. The measured emissivity spectra were fitted to a dielectric function
model and an effective medium approximation. The phonon frequencies and
dielectric constants agreed well with room temperature experimental values from
the literature, as well as with ab initio and first principles calculations. In
addition, the phonon frequencies of the perpendicular mode and the dielectric
constants of the parallel mode showed an appreciable parabolic temperature
dependence, which justifies the interest of more theoretical efforts in order
to explain this behavior. Finally, the results of this work demonstrate that
thermal emission spectroscopy allows obtaining the values of the optical and
dielectric parameters of impure ceramic materials in a simple manner as a
function of temperature.

<h3>Persistent homology and topological statistics of hyperuniform point  clouds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13123" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13123</a>
<br>
<i>Marco Salvalaglio, Dominic J. Skinner, Jörn Dunkel, Axel Voigt</i>
<p>Hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length
scales, is observed across a wide variety of domains, from cosmology to
condensed matter and biological systems. Although the standard definition of
hyperuniformity only utilizes information at the largest scales, hyperuniform
configurations have distinctive local characteristics. However, the influence
of global hyperuniformity on local structure has remained largely unexplored;
establishing this connection can help uncover long-range interaction mechanisms
and detect hyperuniform traits in finite-size systems. Here, we study the
topological properties of hyperuniform point clouds by characterizing their
persistent homology and the statistics of local graph neighborhoods. We find
that varying the structure factor results in configurations with systematically
different topological properties. Moreover, these topological properties are
conserved for subsets of hyperuniform point clouds, establishing a connection
between finite-sized systems and idealized reference arrangements. Comparing
distributions of local topological neighborhoods reveals that the hyperuniform
arrangements lie along a primarily one-dimensional manifold reflecting an
order-to-disorder transition via hyperuniform configurations. The results
presented here complement existing characterizations of hyperuniform phases of
matter, and they show how local topological features can be used to detect
hyperuniformity in size-limited simulations and experiments.

<h3>Tunable Topological Phase Transitions in a Piezoelectric Janus Monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13124</a>
<br>
<i>Tanshia Tahreen Tanisha, Md. Shafayat Hossain, Nishat Tasnim Hiramony, Ashiqur Rasul, M. Zahid Hasan, Quazi D. M. Khosru</i>
<p>Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) insulators represent a quintessential example of a
topological phase of matter, characterized by a conducting edge mode within a
bulk energy gap. The pursuit of a tunable QSH state stands as a pivotal
objective in the development of QSH-based topological devices. In this study,
we employ first-principles calculations to identify three strain-tunable QSH
insulators based on monolayer MAlGaTe4 (where M represents Mg, Ca, or Sr).
These monolayers exhibit dynamic stability, with no imaginary modes detected in
their phonon dispersion. Additionally, they possess piezoelectric properties,
rendering them amenable to strain-induced tuning. While MgAlGaTe4 is a normal
insulator under zero strain, it transitions into the QSH phase when subjected
to external strain. Conversely, CaAlGaTe4 and SrAlGaTe4 already exhibit the QSH
phase at zero strain. Intriguingly, upon the application of biaxial strain,
these two compounds undergo phase transitions, encompassing metallic (M),
normal/trivial insulator (NI), and topological insulator (TI) phases, thereby
illustrating their strain-tunable electronic and topological properties. (Ca,
Sr)AlGaTe4, in particular, undergo M-TI/TI-M transitions under applied strain,
while MgAlGaTe4 additionally experiences an M-NI/NI-M transition, signifying it
as a material featuring a metal-insulator transition (MIT). Remarkably, the
observation of metal-trivial insulator-topological insulator transitions in
MgAlGaTe4 introduces it as a unique material platform in which both MIT and
topological phase transitions can be controlled through the same physical
parameter. Our study thus introduces a novel material platform distinguished by
highly strain-tunable electronic and topological properties, offering promising
prospects for the development of next-generation, low-power topological
devices.

<h3>Splitting Instability in Superalloys: A Phase-Field Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13151</a>
<br>
<i>Tushar Jogi, Saurav Shenoy, R. Sankarasubramanian, Abhik Choudhury, Saswata Bhattacharyya</i>
<p>Precipitation-strengthened alloys, such as Ni-base, Co-base and Fe-base
superalloys, show the development of dendrite-like precipitates in the solid
state during aging at near-$\gamma^{\prime}$ solvus temperatures. These
features arise out of a diffusive instability wherein, due to the point effect
of diffusion, morphological perturbations over a growing sphere/cylinder are
unstable. These dendrite-like perturbations exhibit anisotropic growth
resulting from anisotropy in interfacial/elastic energies. Further,
microstructures in these alloys also exhibit "split" morphologies wherein
dendritic precipitates fragment beyond a critical size, giving rise to a
regular octet or quartet pattern of near-equal-sized precipitates separated by
thin matrix channels. The mechanism of formation of such morphologies has
remained a subject of intense investigation, and multiple theories have been
proposed to explain their occurrence. Here, we developed a phase-field model
incorporating anisotropy in elastic and interfacial energies to investigate the
evolution of these split microstructures during growth and coarsening of
dendritic $\gamma^{\prime}$ precipitates. Our principal finding is that the
reduction in elastic energy density drives the development of split morphology,
albeit a concomitant increase in the surface energy density. We also find that
factors such as supersaturation, elastic misfit, degree of elastic anisotropy
and interfacial energy strongly modulate the formation of these
microstructures. We analyze our simulation results in the light of classical
theories of elastic stress effects on coarsening and prove that negative
elastic interaction energy leads to the stability of split precipitates.

<h3>Spin Seebeck Effect as a Probe for Majorana Fermions in Kitaev Spin  Liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13175" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13175</a>
<br>
<i>Yasuyuki Kato, Joji Nasu, Masahiro Sato, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Takahiro Misawa, Yukitoshi Motome</i>
<p>Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to
exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a
paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by
fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional
quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental
identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck
effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient
probe of the fractional quasiparticles in QSLs, focusing on the Kitaev
honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using the real-time dynamics, the
perturbation theory, and the linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel
spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal
gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid, via the low-energy fractional Majorana
excitations. This underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin
current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the
induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev
interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin
current with (up-)down-spin like nature when the exchange coupling is
(anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already
found in a one-dimensional QSL, our finding reveals that the spin Seebeck
effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the
nature of fractional excitations in the QSLs. We also clarify contrasting
field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit
and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental
identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used
not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in QSLs but also to
generate and control them.

<h3>High-throughput screening for boride superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Shiya Chen, Zepeng Wu, Zhen Zhang, Shunqing Wu, Kai-Ming Ho, Vladimir Antropov, Yang Sun</i>
<p>A high-throughput screening using density functional calculations is
performed to search for stable boride superconductors from the existing
materials database. The workflow employs the fast frozen phonon method as the
descriptor to evaluate the superconducting properties quickly. 23 stable
candidates are identified from the screening. For almost all found binary
compounds, the superconductivity was obtained earlier experimentally or
computationally. For ternary borides, previous studies are very limited. Our
extensive search among ternary systems confirmed superconductivity in known
systems and found several new compounds. Among these discovered superconducting
ternary borides, Ta(MoB)$_2$ shows the highest superconducting temperature of
~12K. Most predicted compounds were synthesized previously; therefore, our
predictions can be examined experimentally. Our work also demonstrates that the
boride systems can have diverse structural motifs that lead to
superconductivity.

<h3>Multiple polaron quasiparticles with dipolar fermions in a bilayer  geometry</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Tiene, A. Tamargo Bracho, M. M. Parish, J. Levinsen, F. M. Marchetti</i>
<p>We study the Fermi polaron problem with dipolar fermions in a bilayer
geometry, where a single dipolar particle in one layer interacts with a Fermi
sea of dipolar fermions in the other layer. By evaluating the polaron spectrum,
we obtain the appearance of a series of attractive branches when the distance
between the layers diminishes. We relate these to the appearance of a series of
bound two-dipole states when the interlayer dipolar interaction strength
increases. By inspecting the orbital angular momentum component of the polaron
branches, we observe an interchange of orbital character when system parameters
such as the gas density or the interlayer distance are varied. Further, we
study the possibility that the lowest energy two-body bound state spontaneously
acquires a finite center of mass momentum when the density of fermions exceeds
a critical value, and we determine the dominating orbital angular momenta that
characterize the pairing. Finally, we propose to use the tunneling rate from
and into an auxiliary layer as an experimental probe of the impurity spectral
function.

<p>Water molecules confined between biological membranes exhibit a distinctive
non-Gaussian displacement distribution, far different from bulk water. Here, we
introduce a new transport equation for water molecules in the intermembrane
space, quantitatively explaining molecular dynamics simulation results. We find
the unique transport dynamics of water molecules stems from the lateral
diffusion coefficient fluctuation caused by their longitudinal motion. We also
identify an interfacial region where water possesses distinct physical
properties, unaffected by changes in the intermembrane separation.

<h3>Novel 3D Reciprocal Space Visualization of Strain Relaxation in InSb on  GaAs Substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13258" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13258</a>
<br>

<p>This study introduces the Reciprocal Space Polar Visualization (RSPV) method,
a novel approach for visualizing X-ray diffraction-based reciprocal space data.
RSPV allows for the precise separation of tilt and strain, facilitating their
individual analysis. InSb was grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on two
(001) GaAs substrates $\unicode{x2014}$ one with no misorientation (Sample A)
$\unicode{x2014}$ one with 2{\deg} surface misorientation from the (001) planes
(Sample B). There is a substantial lattice mismatch with the substrate and this
results in the generation of defects within the InSb layer during growth. To
demonstrate RSPV's effectiveness, a comprehensive comparison of surface
morphology, dislocation density, strain, and tilt was conducted. RSPV revealed
previously unobserved features of the (004) InSb Bragg peak, partially
explained by the presence of threading dislocations and oriented abrupt steps
(OASs). Surface morphologies examined by an atomic force microscope (AFM)
revealed that Sample B had significantly lower root mean square (RMS)
roughness. Independent estimates of threading dislocation density (TDD) using
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI)
confirmed that Sample B exhibited a significantly lower TDD than Sample A. XRD
methods further revealed unequal amounts of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ type threading
dislocations in both samples, contributing to an anisotropic Bragg peak. RSPV
is shown to be a robust method for exploring 3D reciprocal space in any
crystal, demonstrating that growing InSb on misoriented GaAs produced a
higher-quality crystal compared to an on-orientation substrate.

<h3>Dynamical Chiral Nernst Effect in Twisted Van der Waals Few Layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13278" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13278</a>
<br>
<i>Juncheng Li, Dawei Zhai, Cong Xiao, Wang Yao</i>
<p>The Nernst effect is a fundamental thermoelectric conversion phenomenon that
was deemed to be possible only in systems with magnetic field or magnetization.
In this work, we propose a novel dynamical chiral Nernst effect that can appear
in two-dimensional van der Waals materials with chiral structural symmetry in
the absence of any magnetic degree of freedom. This unconventional effect is
triggered by time variation of an out-of-plane electric field, and has an
intrinsic quantum geometric origin linked to not only the intralayer
center-of-mass motion but also the interlayer coherence of electronic states.
We demonstrate the effect in twisted homobilayer and homotrilayer transition
metal dichalcogenides, where the strong twisted interlayer coupling leads to
sizable intrinsic Nernst conductivities well within the experimental capacity.
This work suggests a new route for electric control of thermoelectric
conversion.

<p>We performed $^{75}$As-NMR measurements in $H\parallel ab$ to investigate the
normal-state magnetic properties of CeRh$_2$As$_2$, a recently-discovered
heavy-fermion superconductor. We compared the NMR Knight shift $K$ with the
magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{ab}$, and estimated the hyperfine coupling
constant $A_{\mathrm{hf}}$ from the slope of the $K-\chi$ plot. We observed
that the magnitude of $A_{\mathrm{hf},ab}$ at the As(1) site changes at around
20 K owing to emerging the heavy-fermion state, which was also observed in
$A_{\mathrm{hf}}$ at the As(2) site and in $H\parallel c$. The sign of
$A_{\mathrm{hf},ab}$ at the As(1) site is negative in low temperature. These
are important for the analysis of the NMR results of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ in the
superconducting state.

<h3>Tunable electron scattering mechanism in plasmonic SrMoO$_3$ thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13297" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13297</a>
<br>
<i>Rahma Dhani Prasetiyawati, Seung Gyo Jeong, Chan-Koo Park, Sehwan Song, Sungkyun Park, Tuson Park, Woo Seok Choi</i>
<p>4d transition metal perovskite oxides serve as suitable testbeds for the
study of strongly correlated metallic properties. Among these, $SrMoO_{3}$
(SMO) exhibits remarkable electrical conductivity at room temperature. The
temperature-dependent resistivity $(\rho(T))$ exhibits a Fermi-liquid behavior
below the transition temperature $T^{*}$, reflecting the dominant
electron-electron interaction. Above $T^{*}$, electron-phonon interaction
becomes more appreciable. In this study, we employed the power-law scaling of
$\rho(T)$ to rigorously determine the $T^{*}$. We further demonstrate that the
$T^{*}$ can be modified substantially by ~40 K in epitaxial thin films. It
turns out that the structural quality determines $T^{*}$. Whereas the plasma
frequency could be tuned by the change in the electron-electron interaction via
the effective mass enhancement, we show that the plasmonic properties are more
directly governed by the electron-impurity scattering. The facile control of
the electron scattering mechanism through structural quality modulation can be
useful for plasmonic sensing applications in the visible region.

<h3>Magnetic structure and Ising-like antiferromagnetism in the bilayer  triangular lattice compound NdZnPO</h3>

<p>The complex interplay of spin frustration and quantum fluctuations in
low-dimensional quantum materials leads to a variety of intriguing phenomena.
This research focuses on a detailed analysis of the magnetic behavior exhibited
by NdZnPO, a bilayer spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet. The
investigation employs magnetization, specific heat, and powder neutron
scattering measurements. At zero field, a long-range magnetic order is observed
at $T_{\rm N}=1.64~\rm K$. Powder neutron diffraction experiments show the
Ising-like magnetic moments along the $c$-axis, revealing a stripe-like
magnetic structure with three equivalent magnetic propagation vectors.
Application of a magnetic field along the $c$-axis suppresses the
antiferromagnetic order, leading to a fully polarized ferromagnetic state above
$B_{\rm c}=4.5~\rm T$. This transition is accompanied by notable enhancements
in the nuclear Schottky contribution. Moreover, the absence of spin frustration
and expected field-induced plateau-like phases are remarkable observations.
Detailed calculations of magnetic dipolar interactions revealed complex
couplings reminiscent of a honeycomb lattice, suggesting the potential
emergence of Kitaev-like physics within this system. This comprehensive study
of the magnetic properties of NdZnPO highlights unresolved intricacies,
underscoring the imperative for further exploration to unveil the underlying
governing mechanisms.

<h3>Relaxation Dynamics in Persistent Epithelial Tissues</h3>

<br>
<i>Meng-Yuan Li, Yan-Wei Li</i>
<p>Cell monolayers and epithelial tissues display slow dynamics during the
liquid-glass transitions, a phenomenon with direct relevance to embryogenesis,
tumor metastases, and wound healing. In active cells, persistent motion and
cell deformation compete, significantly influencing relaxation dynamics. Here,
we numerically construct the liquid-glass transition phase diagram for
two-dimensional polydisperse persistent cells. We employ cage-relative measures
and conduct extensive simulations to eliminate the influence of system size
effects. These effects arise from long-wavelength fluctuations in nearly
equilibrated cells and a combination of long-wavelength fluctuations and
non-equilibrium effects in highly persistent cells. Our study unveils
distinctive intermittent dynamics associated with intermittent T1 transitions
in highly persistent cells, where the velocity correlates over space with a
characteristic length $\xi$. The $\alpha$ relaxation time exhibits a universal
power-law dependence on the irreversible T1 transition rate,
$\Gamma_{\rm{T1}}^{\rm irr}$, multiplied by ${\rm exp}(\xi)$. Here, $\xi$
vanishes in nearly equilibrated cells, and $\Gamma_{\rm{T1}}^{\rm irr}$
diminishes towards the mode-coupling glass transition point.

<h3>Fast low-temperature irradiation creep driven by athermal defect  dynamics</h3>

<p>The occurrence of high stress concentrations in reactor components is a still
intractable phenomenon encountered in fusion reactor design. We observe and
quantitatively model a non-linear high-dose radiation mediated microstructure
evolution effect that facilitates fast stress relaxation in the most
challenging low-temperature limit. In situ observations of a tensioned tungsten
wire exposed to a high-energy ion beam show that internal stress of up to 2 GPa
relaxes within minutes, with the extent and time-scale of relaxation accurately
predicted by a parameter-free multiscale model informed by atomistic
simulations. As opposed to conventional notions of radiation creep, the effect
arises from the self-organisation of nanoscale crystal defects, athermally
coalescing into extended polarized dislocation networks that compensate and
alleviate the external stress.

<h3>Tracer diffusion beyond Gaussian behavior: explicit results for general  single-file systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13409" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13409</a>
<br>
<i>Aurélien Grabsch, Olivier Bénichou</i>
<p>Single-file systems, in which particles diffuse in narrow channels while not
overtaking each other, is a fundamental model for the tracer subdiffusion
observed in confined geometries, such as in zeolites or carbon nanotubes.
Twenty years ago, the mean squared displacement of a tracer was determined at
large times, for any diffusive single-file system. Since then, for a general
single-file system, even the determination of the fourth cumulant, which probes
the deviation from Gaussianity, has remained an open question. Here, we fill
this gap and provide an explicit formula for the fourth cumulant of an
arbitrary single-file system. Our approach also allows us to quantify the
perturbation induced by the tracer on its environment, encoded in the
correlation profiles. These explicit results constitute a first step towards
obtaining a closed equation for the correlation profiles for arbitrary
single-file systems.

<h3>Layer-Dependent Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13413</a>
<br>
<i>Zhaochen Liu, Jing Wang</i>
<p>The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, first proposed by the Haldane model,
has become a paradigmatic example of application of band topology to condensed
matter physics. The recent experimental discoveries of high Chern number QAH
effect in pentalayer and tetralayer rhombohedral graphene highlights the
intriguing interplay between strong interactions and spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
Here we propose a minimal interacting model for spin-orbit coupled rhombohedral
graphene and use the Hartree-Fock analysis to explore the phase diagram at
charge neutrality. We find that with Ising SOC on one outmost graphene layer,
the in-plane layer-antiferromagnetic order is the insulating ground state
without displacement field. Upon increasing the gate displacement field, we
find that the QAH state with Chern number being equal to the layer number
emerges between layer-antiferromagentic state and layer-polarized state, which
is consistent with experimental observations. We further study phase diagram
for different thickness and find pentalayer is optimal for the QAH effect.
Finally, we predict that QAH state is enlarged by engineering opposite Ising
SOC on the opposite outmost layers of rhombohedral graphene.

<i>Xavier Batlle, Carlos Moya, Mariona Escoda Torroellla, Oscar Iglesias, Arantxa Fraile Rodriguez, Amilcar Labarta</i>
<p>Some of the synthesis methods and physical properties of iron-oxide based
magnetic nanoparticles such as Fe3-xO4 and CoxFe3-xO4 are reviewed because of
their interest in health, environmental applications, and ultra-high-density
magnetic recording. Unlike high crystalline quality nanoparticles larger than a
few nanometers that show bulk-like magnetic and electronic properties,
nanostructures with increasing structural defects yield a progressive worsening
of their general performance due to frozen magnetic disorder and local breaking
of their crystalline symmetry. Thus, it is shown that single-crystal,
monophasic nanoparticles do not exhibit significant surface or finite-size
effects, such as spin canting, reduced saturation magnetization, high closure
magnetic fields, hysteresis-loop shift or dead magnetic layer features which
are mostly associated with crystallographic defective systems. Besides, the key
role of the nanoparticle coating, surface anisotropy, and inter-particle
interactions are discussed. Finally, the results of some single particle
techniques -- magnetic force microscopy, X-ray photoemission electron
microscopy, and electron magnetic chiral dichroism -- that allow studying
individual nanoparticles down to sub-nanometer resolution with element, valence
and magnetic selectivity, are presented. All in all, the intimate, fundamental
correlation of the nanostructure (crystalline, chemical, magnetic) to the
physical properties of the nanoparticles is ascertained.

<h3>Two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor Cr2XP: First-principles  calculations and Monte Carlo simulations</h3>

<i>Xiao-Ping Wei, Lan-Lan Du, Jiang-Liu Meng, Xiaoma Tao</i>
<p>According to the Mermin Wagner theorem, two-dimensional material is difficult
to have the Curie temperature above room temperature. By using the method of
band engineering, we design a promising two-dimensional ferromagnetic
semiconductor Cr2XP (X=P, As, Sb) with large magnetization, high Curie
temperature and sizable band gap. The formation of gap is discussed in terms of
the hybridizations, occupation and distribution of electronic states and charge
transfer. Large magnetic moments about 6.16~6.37uB origin from the occupation
of Cr-d electrons in crystal field.Competition and cooperation between d-d
(Cr-d~Cr-d) and d-p-d (Cr-d~X-p~Cr-d) exchange interactions lead to the
emergence of ferromagnetic ordering phase. Furthermore, Curie temperatures,
approaching to 269 K, 332 K and 400 K for Cr2P2, Cr2AsP and Cr2SbP, are
estimated by employing Monte Carlo simulation based on the Heisenberg model.
Magnetic anisotropy energy of Cr2XP is determined by calculating the total
energy dependence on the angle along different directions, and the origin is
also discussed by the second-order perturbation theory. In addition, the Cr2XP
possesses excellent thermodynamical, dynamical and mechanical stabilities, and
can overcome their own gravity to keep their planar structure without the
support of substrate. These above-mentioned advantages will offer some valuable
hints for two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor Cr2XP in spintronic
devices.

<h3>A shape-driven reentrant jamming transition in confluent monolayers of  synthetic cell-mimics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13437" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13437</a>
<br>
<i>Pragya Arora, Souvik Sadhukhan, Saroj Kumar Nandi, Dapeng Bi, A K Sood, Rajesh Ganapathy</i>
<p>Many critical biological processes, like wound healing, require confluent
cell monolayers/bulk tissues to transition from a jammed solid-like to a
fluid-like state. Although numerical studies anticipate changes in the cell
shape alone can lead to unjamming, experimental support for this prediction is
not definitive because, in living systems, fluidization due to density changes
cannot be ruled out. Additionally, a cell's ability to modulate its motility
only compounds difficulties since even in assemblies of rigid active particles,
changing the nature of self-propulsion has non-trivial effects on the dynamics.
Here, we design and assemble a monolayer of synthetic cell-mimics and examine
their collective behaviour. By systematically increasing the persistence time
of self-propulsion, we discovered a cell shape-driven, density-independent,
re-entrant jamming transition. Notably, we observed cell shape and shape
variability were mutually constrained in the confluent limit and followed the
same universal scaling as that observed in confluent epithelia. Dynamical
heterogeneities, however, did not conform to this scaling, with the fast cells
showing suppressed shape variability, which our simulations revealed is due to
a transient confinement effect of these cells by their slower neighbors. Our
experiments unequivocally establish a morphodynamic link, demonstrating that
geometric constraints alone can dictate epithelial jamming/unjamming.

<p>We report a study of the high-pressure structural behavior of ZnV2O6,
Zn2V2O7, and Zn3V2O8, which has been explored by means of synchrotron powder
x-ray diffraction. We found that ZnV2O6 and Zn3V2O8 remain in the
ambient-pressure structure up to 15 GPa. In contrast, in the same pressure
range, Zn2V2O7 undergoes three phase transitions at 0.7, 3.0, and 10.8 GPa,
respectively. Possible crystal structures for the first and second
high-pressure phases are proposed. Reasons for the distinctive behavior of
Zn2V2O7 are discussed. The compressibility of the different polymorphs has been
determined. The response to pressure is found to be anisotropic in all the
considered compounds and the room-temperature equations of state have been
determined. The bulk moduli of ZnV2O6 (129(2) GPa) and Zn3V2O8 (120(2) GPa) are
consistent with a structural framework composed of compressible ZnO6 octahedra
and uncompressible VO4 tetrahedra. In contrast, Zn2V2O7 is highly compressible
with a bulk modulus of 58(9) GPa, which is almost half of the bulk modulus of
the other two vanadates. The large compressibility of Zn2V2O7 and its sequence
of structural transitions are related to the fact that this material is less
dense than the other zinc vanadates and to the penta-coordination of Zn atoms
by oxygen atoms in Zn2V2O7. A comparison to the high-pressure behavior of
related compounds is presented.

<h3>Disorder-induced phase transitions in higher-order nodal line semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Yue-Ran Ding, Dong-Hui Xu, Chui-Zhen Chen</i>
<p>Higher-order nodal line semimetals represent a recently proposed topological
semimetal class that harbors bulk nodal lines and features gapless hinge Fermi
arc excitations, governed by the bulk-hinge correspondence. In this study, we
investigate the disorder effect on a higher-order nodal line semimetal and the
consequent phase transitions. Within the pristine higher-order nodal line
semimetal model, we unveil three distinct phases: higher-order nodal line
semimetal, conventional nodal line semimetal, and normal insulator. The
higher-order nodal line semimetal is characterized by one-dimensional hinge
Fermi arc states connecting a pair of nodal rings, contrasting with
conventional nodal line semimetals that exhibit two-dimensional drumhead
surface states. We demonstrate that disorder can trigger multiple phase
transitions within this system. Significantly, intermediate disorder can induce
higher-order topology in an initial conventional nodal line semimetal or even
an initial normal insulator. Further increase in disorder drives the system
through a diffusive metallic phase before ultimately reaching the Anderson
insulator regime. Employing a combination of finite-size scaling analysis and
an effective medium theory, we construct a comprehensive phase diagram,
elucidating the intricate interplay between disorder and topology.

<br>
<i>J. Khatua, Suheon Lee, Gyungbin Ban, Marc Uhlarz, Kwang-Yong Choi, P. Khuntia</i>
<p>Competing magnetic interactions, frustration driven quantum fluctuations, and
spin correlations offer an ideal route for the experimental realization of
emergent quantum phenomena and exotic quasi particle excitations in 3D
frustrated magnets. In this context, trillium lattice, wherein magnetic ions
decorate a three-dimensional chiral network of corner-shared equilateral
triangular motifs, provides a viable ground. Herein, we present the crystal
structure, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electron spin-resonance,
muSR results on the polycrystalline samples of K2CrTi(PO4)3 wherein the Cr3+
ions form a perfect trillium lattice without any detectable anti-site disorder.
The Curie-Weiss fit of the magnetic susceptibility data above 100 K yields a
Curie-Weiss temperature of -23 K, which indicates the presence of dominant
antiferromagnetic interactions between Cr3+ (S=3/2) moments. The specific heat
measurements reveal the occurrence of two consecutive phase transitions, at
temperatures TL = 4.3 K and TH = 8 K, corresponding to two different magnetic
phases and it unveils the existence of short-range spin correlations above the
ordering temperature TH. The power-law behavior of ESR linewidth suggests the
persistence of short-range spin correlations over a relatively wide critical
region in agreement with the specific heat results. The muSR resultsprovide
concrete evidence of two different phases corresponding to two transitions,
coupled with thecritical slowing down of spin fluctuations above TL and
persistent spin dynamics below TL, consistent with the thermodynamic results.
Moreover, the muSR results reveal the coexistence of static and dynamic local
magnetic fields below TL, signifying the presence of complex magnetic phases
owing to the entwining of spin correlations and competing magnetic interactions
in this three-dimensional frustrated magnet.

<br>
<i>Ritwik Das, Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Indra Dasgupta</i>
<p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect resulting from the in-plane magnetization
in the OsCl$_3$ monolayer is shown to exhibit different electronic topological
phases determined by the crystal symmetries and magnetism. In this Chern
insulator, the Os-atoms form a two dimensional planar honeycomb structure with
an easy-plane ferromagnetic configuration and the required non-adiabatic paths
to tune the topology of electronic structure exist for specific magnetic
orientations based on mirror symmetries of the system. Using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, these tunable phases are identified by changing the
orientation of the magnetic moments. We argue that in contrast to the buckled
system, here the Cl-ligands bring non-trivial topology into the system by
breaking the in-plane mirror symmetry. The interplay between the magnetic
anisotropy and electronic band-topology changes the Chern number and hence the
topological phases. Our DFT study is corroborated with comprehensive analysis
of relevant symmetries as well as a detailed explanation of topological phase
transitions using a generic tight binding model.

<i>A. Liang, C. Popescu, F. J. Manjon, P. Rodriguez-Hernandez, A. Munoz, Z. Hebboul, D. Errandonea</i>
<p>We report a characterization of the high-pressure behavior of zinc-iodate,
Zn(IO3)2. By the combination of x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and
first-principles calculations we have found evidence of two subtle isosymmetric
structural phase transitions. We present arguments relating these transitions
to a non-linear behavior of phonons and changes induced by pressure on the
coordination sphere of the iodine atoms. This fact is explained as a
consequence of the formation of metavalent bonding at high-pressure which is
favored by the lone-electron pairs of iodine. In addition, the pressure
dependence of unit-cell parameters, volume, and bond is reported. An equation
of state to describe the pressure dependence of the volume is presented,
indicating that Zn(IO3)2 is the most compressible iodate among those studied up
to now. Finally, phonon frequencies are reported together with their symmetry
assignment and pressure dependence.

<p>The high-pressure crystal structure evolution of CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3)
perovskite has been investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and
synchrotron-based powder X-ray diffraction. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
reveals that the crystal structure of MAPbBr3 undergoes two phase transitions
following the space-group sequence: Pm-3m-to-Im3-to-Pmn21. The transitions take
place at around 0.8 and 1.8 GPa, respectively. This result is contradicting the
previously reported phase transition sequence: Pm-3m-to-Im3-to-Pnma. In this
work the crystal structures of each of the three phases are determined from
single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis which is later supported by Rietveld
refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns. The pressure dependence of the
crystal lattice parameters and unit-cell volumes are determined from the two
aforementioned techniques, as well as the bulk moduli for each phase. The
bandgap behaviour of MAPbBr3 has been studied up to around 4 GPa, by the means
of single-crystal optical-absorption experiments. The evolution of the bandgap
has been well explained using the pressure dependence of the Pb-Br bond
distance and Pb-Br-Pb angles as determined from single-crystal X-ray
diffraction experiments.

<p>The properties of kagome metals are governed by the interdependence of band
topology and electronic correlations resulting in remarkably rich phase
diagrams. Here, we study the temperature evolution of the bulk electronic
structure of the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe using infrared
spectroscopy. We uncover drastic changes in the low-energy interband absorption
at the 100 K structural phase transition that has been linked to a
charge-density-wave (CDW) instability. We explain this effect by the minuscule
Fe displacement in the kagome plane, which results in parallel bands in the
vicinity of the Fermi level. In contrast to conventional CDW materials,
however, the spectral weight shifts to low energies, ruling out the opening of
a CDW gap in FeGe.

<p>In this work, we report diffuse reflectivity measurements in InNbO4, ScNbO4,
YNbO4, and eight different rare-earth niobates. From a comparison with the
established values of the band gap of InNbO4 and ScNbO4, we have found that the
broadly used Tauc plot analysis leads to erroneous estimates of the band-gap
energy of niobates. In contrast, accurate results are obtained considering
excitonic contributions using the Elliot-Toyozawa model. We have found that
YNbO4 and the rare-earth niobates are wide band-gap materials. The band-gap
energy is 3.25 eV for CeNbO4, 4.35 eV for LaNbO4, 4.5 eV for YNbO4, and 4.73 -
4.93 eV for SmNbO4, EuNbO4, GdNbO4, DyNbO4, HoNbO4, and YbNbO4. An explanation
for the obtained results will be presented. The fact that the band-gap energy
is nearly not affected by the rare-earth substitution from SmNbO4 to YbNbO4 and
the circumstance that these are the compounds with the largest band gap are a
consequence of the fact that the band structure near the Fermi level originates
mainly from Nb 4d and O 2p orbitals. We hypothesize that YNbO4, CeVO4, and
LaNbO4 have smaller band gaps because of the contribution from rare-earth atom
4d or 5f states to the states near the Fermi level.

<p>Here we report muon spin rotation (muSR) experiments on the temperature and
field dependence of the effective magnetic penetration depth (lambda) in the
eta-carbide-type suboxide Ti4Ir2O, a superconductor with an considerably high
upper critical field. Temperature dependence of penetration depth, obtained
from transverse-field (TF)-muSR measurements, is in perfect agreement with an
isotropic fully gaped superconducting state. Furthermore, our ZF muSR results
confirm that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting
state. We find, however, a notably low ratio of 1.22 between the
superconducting critical temperature and the superfluid density. This value is
close to most unconventional superconductors, showing that a very small
superfluid density is present in the superconducting state of Ti4Ir2O. The
presented results will pave the way for further theoretical and experimental
investigations to obtain a microscopic understanding of the origin of such a
high upper critical field in an isotropic single gap superconducting system.

<h3>Reversible out-of-plane to in-plane magnetic transition by electrical  and thermal cycling in Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$/BaTiO$_3$(001)</h3>

<i>Adrián Begué, Muhammad Waqas Khaliq, Noelia Cotón, Alejandro Cabrera, Miguel Ángel Niño, Michael Foerster, Rocío Ranchal</i>
<p>The study investigates the manipulation of the magnetic anisotropy in a thick
(1 $\mu$m) Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$ layer electrodeposited on a ferroelectric
BaTiO$_3$(001) substrate, using a combination of Magneto-optical Kerr Effect,
Photoemission Electron Microscopy with X-ray circular magnetic dichroism and
X-ray diffraction. In the as-grown state, the system shows weak perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy and characteristic stripe domains. Upon out-of-plane
electrical poling of the BaTiO$_3$ substrate, the magnetic anisotropy switches
to in-plane with a strong uniaxial behavior. This change is ascribed to the
magnetoelastic effect due to the switching of the BaTiO$_3$ ferroelectric [001]
axis into the sample plane, as evidenced by XRD. The strong mechanical
interaction with the thick Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$ overlayer prevents the full
inversion of the substrate. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be
recovered by a mild thermal annealing above the BaTiO$_3$ tetrahedral to cubic
phase transition and can be cycled by repeated electrical poling/thermal
annealing. This method opens the path to a reversible control of the magnetic
anisotropy in Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$/BaTiO$_3$ heterostructures from perpendicular
to in-plane.

<i>Eric Giglio</i>
<p>The numerical code InCa4D, used for simulating CPU-efficiently the guiding of
charged beam particles through insulating straight nano or macro capillaries,
is presented in detail. The paper may be regarded as a walk through our
numerical code where we will detail how we sample the inserted beam with a
given emittance, how we compute the charge deposition and charge dynamics at
the interfaces of the insulating capillary, how we evaluate the electric field
by accounting for imposed boundary conditions and how we evaluate efficiently
the trajectories of the inserted charged particles. The code InCa4D accounts
for the correct screening of the deposited charges by polarization charges that
appear at the interfaces and for the correct relaxation rates and decay rates
in the case where the outer surface of the capillary is covered by a grounded
conducting paint or not.

<h3>Tuning of Charge Order by Uniaxial Stress in a Cuprate Superconductor</h3>

<p>Strongly correlated electron materials are often characterized by competition
and interplay of multiple quantum states. For example, in high-temperature
cuprate superconductors unconventional superconductivity, spin- and
charge-density wave orders coexist. A key question is whether competing states
coexist on the atomic scale or if they segregate into distinct 'islands'. Using
X-ray diffraction, we investigate the competition between charge order and
superconductivity in the archetypal cuprate La(2-x)BaxCuO4, around the x =
1/8-doping, where uniaxial stress restores optimal 3D superconductivity at
approximately 0.06 GPa. We find that the charge order peaks and the correlation
length along the stripe are strongly reduced up to the critical stress, above
which they stay constant. Simultaneously, the charge order onset temperature
only shows a modest decrease. Our findings suggest that optimal 3D
superconductivity is not linked to the absence of charge stripes but instead
requires their arrangement into smaller 'islands'. Our results provide insight
into the length scales over which the interplay between superconductivity and
charge order takes place.

<h3>Equilibrium structure and shape of Ag and Pt nanoparticles grown on  silica surfaces: from experimental investigations to the determination of a  metal-silica potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13528" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13528</a>
<br>
<i>F. Ait Hellal, C. Andreazza-Vignolle, P. Andreazza, J. Puibasset</i>
<p>A combination of experimental and numerical calculations on metallic silver
and platinum nanoparticles deposited on silica substrates is presented, with a
focus on the metal-substrate interactions. Experimentally, the nanoparticles
are elaborated under ultra-high vacuum and characterized by Grazing-Incidence
Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and High Resolution Transmission
Electronic Microscopy (HRTEM) to determine their structure and morphology, and
in particular their aspect ratio (height/diameter) which quantifies the
metal-substrate interaction. Numerically, the interactions between the metal
and the silica species are modeled with the Lennard-Jones (12, 6) potential,
with two parameters for each metal and silica species. The geometric parameters
were found in the literature, while the energetic parameters were determined
from our experimental measurements of the aspect ratio. The parameters are:
{\sigma}_{Ag-O} = 0.278 nm, {\sigma}_{Ag-Si} = 0.329 nm, {\epsilon}_{Ag-O} = 75
meV, and {\epsilon}_{Ag-Si} = 13 meV for Ag-silica and {\sigma}_{Pt-O} = 0.273
nm, {\sigma}_{Pt-Si} = 0.324 nm, {\epsilon}_{Pt-O} = 110 meV, and
{\epsilon}_{Pt-Si} = 18 meV for Pt-silica. The proposed Ag-silica potential
reproduces quantitatively the unexpected experimental observation of the
variation of the aspect ratio for Ag nanoparticles larger than 5 nm, which has
been interpreted as a consequence of the silica roughness. The nanoparticle
orientation, structure and disorder are also considered. This metal-silica
potential for Ag and Pt should be helpful for further studies on pure metals as
well as their alloys.

<h3>Moving crystal phases of a quantum Wigner solid in an ultra-high-quality  2D electron system</h3>

<i>P. T. Madathil, K. A. Villegas Rosales, Y. J. Chung, K. W. West, K. W. Baldwin, L. N. Pfeiffer, L. W. Engel, M. Shayegan</i>
<p>In low-disorder, two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs), the fractional
quantum Hall states at very small Landau level fillings ($\nu$) terminate in a
Wigner solid (WS) phase, where electrons arrange themselves in a periodic
array. The WS is typically pinned by the residual disorder sites and manifests
an insulating behavior, with non-linear current-voltage (\textit{I-V}) and
noise characteristics. We report here, measurements on an ultra-low-disorder,
dilute 2DES, confined to a GaAs quantum well. In the $\nu < 1/5$ range,
superimposed on a highly-insulating longitudinal resistance, the 2DES exhibits
a developing fractional quantum Hall state at $\nu=1/7$, attesting to its
exceptional high quality, and dominance of electron-electron interaction in the
low filling regime. In the nearby insulating phases, we observe remarkable
non-linear \textit{I-V} and noise characteristics as a function of increasing
current, with current thresholds delineating three distinct phases of the WS: a
pinned phase (P1) with very small noise, a second phase (P2) in which $dV/dI$
fluctuates between positive and negative values and is accompanied by very high
noise, and a third phase (P3) where $dV/dI$ is nearly constant and small, and
noise is about an order of magnitude lower than in P2. In the depinned (P2 and
P3) phases, the noise spectrum also reveals well-defined peaks at frequencies
that vary linearly with the applied current, suggestive of washboard
frequencies. We discuss the data in light of a recent theory that proposes
different dynamic phases for a driven WS.

<br>
<i>Mattia Rudi, Alessandro De Martino, Kristof Moors, Domenico Giuliano, Francesco Buccheri</i>
<p>We study transport through interfaces in topological nodal-line semimetals,
focusing on two geometries: a single interface between two large samples, one
nodal-line semimetal and one metal, and an infinite nodal-line semimetal slab
in between two metallic regions. We investigate the dependence of the spectra
on the boundary conditions, showing how they affect the surface states and the
band dispersion. We find a set of drum states, arising from the hybridization
of the drumhead states on opposite surfaces at finite slab width, and describe
their signatures in the transport properties of a clean sample. Finally, we
compute the electronic trajectories in the ballistic regime and show that there
is a series of resonant angles that ensure perfect transmission. We also show
how the current density profile acquires an inhomogeneous distribution in the
radial direction.

<h3>Cobalt-Based Pyroxenes: A New Playground for Kitaev Physics and Ising  Model Realization</h3>

<p>Recent advances in the study of cobaltites have unveiled their potential as a
promising platform for realizing Kitaev physics in honeycomb systems and the
Ising model in weakly coupled chain materials. In this manuscript, we explore
the magnetic properties of pyroxene SrCoGe$_2$O$_6$ using a combination of
neutron scattering, {\it ab initio} methods, and linear spin-wave theory.
Through careful examination of inelastic neutron scattering powder spectra, we
propose a modified Kitaev model to accurately describe the twisted chains of
edge-sharing octahedra surrounding Co$^{2+}$ ions. The extended
Kitaev-Heisenberg model, including a significant anisotropic bond-dependent
exchange term with $K/|J|=0.96$, is identified as the key descriptor of the
magnetic interactions in SrCoGe$_2$O$_6$. Furthermore, our heat capacity
measurements reveal an effect of an external magnetic field (approximately
13~T) which shifts the system from a fragile antiferromagnetic ordering with
$T_{\mathrm{N}}=9$~K to a field-induced state. We argue that pyroxenes,
particularly those modified by substituting Ge with Si and its less extended
$p$ orbitals, emerge as a novel platform for the Kitaev model. This opens up
possibilities for advancing our understanding of Kitaev physics.

<h3>Gaseous Diffusion as a Correlated Random Walk</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13571" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13571</a>
<br>
<i>Santos Bravo Yuste, Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó</i>
<p>The mean square displacement per collision of a molecule (also referred to as
a random walker or intruder) immersed in a gas at equilibrium is given by its
mean square displacement between two consecutive collisions (mean square free
path) corrected by a prefactor in the form of a series. The $(n+1)$-th term of
the series is directly proportional to the mean value of the projection of
$\mathbf{r}_i$ over $\mathbf{r}_{i-n}$, being $\mathbf{r}_i$ the displacement
of the intruder between the $(i-1)$-th and $i$-th collision. In this article,
we provide simple arguments to derive an accurate approximate expression for
each term of the series. Summation of this series enables the determination of
both the mean square displacement and the diffusion coefficient, which are
expressed exclusively in terms of two quantities: the mean square free path and
the mean persistence ratio (a quantity related to the correlation between
velocities before and after a collision). The key result in this random walk
approach is that the ratio of two consecutive terms of the corrective series is
well approximated by the mean persistence ratio. We consider exact expressions
for the terms of this series and calculate the ratio of several consecutive
terms for the case of hard spheres. We find that these ratios are indeed very
well approximated by the mean persistence ratio, which supports our approach.
These theoretical results are confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations of the
Boltzmann equation. A simple and an improved expression for the diffusion
coefficient $D$ are derived. They are compared with the so-called first and
second Sonine approximations to $D$ as well as with computer simulations of the
Boltzmann equation. It is found that the improved random walk diffusion
coefficient exhibits a very good agreement with simulation results across all
intruder and molecule mass ranges.

<h3>Geometrical design for pure current-driven domain wall nucleation and  shifting</h3>

<p>Nucleation of domain walls by current-driving a single domain wall, confined
to the junction area of two symmetrical strips, is investigated using
systematic micromagnetic simulations. Secondary domain walls (equivalently,
bits encoded in domains) are simultaneously nucleated and driven by
alternatively applying current pulses between two terminals in the structure.
Simulations show that nanosecond-duration current pulses nucleate and drive
series of robust up/down domains even under realistic conditions. These results
demonstrate a technique for sequentially nucleating and shifting domain walls
without using attached external bit lines, fields or modifying the
ferromagnetic strip.

<h3>Interfacial free energy and Tolman length of curved liquid-solid  interfaces from equilibrium studies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13589" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13589</a>
<br>
<i>P. Montero de Hijes, Jorge. R. Espinosa, Valentino Bianco, Eduardo Sanz, Carlos Vega</i>
<p>In this work, we study by means of simulations of hard spheres the
equilibrium between a spherical solid cluster and the fluid. In the NVT
ensemble we observe stable/metastable clusters of the solid phase in
equilibrium with the fluid, representing configurations that are global/local
minima of the Helmholtz free energy. Then, we run NpT simulations of the
equilibrated system at the average pressure of the NVT run and observe that the
clusters are critical because they grow/shrink with a probability of 1/2.
Therefore, a crystal cluster equilibrated in the NVT ensemble corresponds to a
Gibbs free energy maximum where the nucleus is in unstable equilibrium with the
surrounding fluid, in accordance with what has been recently shown for vapor
bubbles in equilibrium with the liquid. Then, within the Seeding framework, we
use Classical Nucleation Theory to obtain both the interfacial free energy
{\gamma} and the nucleation rate. The latter is in very good agreement with
independent estimates using techniques that do not rely on Classical Nucleation
Theory when the mislabeling criterion is used to identify the molecules of the
solid cluster. We therefore argue that the radius obtained from the mislabeling
criterion provides a good approximation for the radius of tension, Rs. We
obtain an estimate of the Tolman length by extrapolating the difference between
Re (the Gibbs dividing surface) and Rs to infinite radius. We show that such
definition of the Tolman length coincides with that obtained by fitting
{\gamma} versus 1/Rs to a straight line as recently applied to hard spheres

<i>Leandro Benatto, Omar Mesquita, Lucimara S. Roman, Marlus Koehler, Rodrigo B. Capaz, Graziâni Candiotto</i>
<p>The refractive index of an optical medium is essential for studying a variety
of physical phenomena. One useful method for determining the refractive index
of scalar materials (i.e, materials which are characterized by a scalar
dielectric function) is to employ the Kramers-Kronig (K-K) relations. The K-K
method is particularly useful in cases where ellipsometric measurements are
unavailable, a situation that frequently occurs in many laboratories. Although
some packages can perform this calculation, they usually lack a graphical
interface and are complex to implement and use. Those deficiencies inhibits
their utilization by a plethora of researchers unfamiliar with programming
languages. To address the aforementioned gap, we have developed the Refractive
Index Calculator (RI-Calc) program that provides an intuitive and user-friendly
interface. The RI-Calc program allows users to input the absorption coefficient
spectrum and then easily calculate the complex refractive index and the complex
relative permittivity of a broad range of thin films, including of molecules,
polymers, blends, and perovskites. The program has been thoroughly tested,
taking into account the Lorentz oscillator model and experimental data from a
materials' refractive index database, demonstrating consistent outcomes. It is
compatible with Windows, Unix, and macOS operating systems. You can download
the RI-Calc binaries from our GitHub repository or conveniently access the
program through our dedicated web server at nanocalc.org.

<h3>Unsupervised Model Learning for Quantum Impurity Systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonas B. Rigo, Andrew K. Mitchell</i>
<p>Generalized quantum impurity models -- which feature a few localized and
strongly-correlated degrees of freedom coupled to itinerant conduction
electrons -- describe diverse physical systems, from magnetic moments in metals
to nanoelectronics quantum devices such as quantum dots or single-molecule
transistors. Correlated materials can also be understood as self-consistent
impurity models through dynamical mean field theory. Accurate simulation of
such models is challenging, especially at low temperatures, due to many-body
effects from electronic interactions, resulting in strong renormalization. In
particular, the interplay between local impurity complexity and Kondo physics
is highly nontrivial. A common approach, which we further develop in this work,
is to consider instead a simpler effective impurity model that still captures
the low-energy physics of interest. The mapping from bare to effective model is
typically done perturbatively, but even this can be difficult for complex
systems, and the resulting effective model parameters can anyway be quite
inaccurate. Here we develop a non-perturbative, unsupervised machine learning
approach to systematically obtain low-energy effective impurity-type models,
based on the renormalization group framework. The method is shown to be general
and flexible, as well as accurate and systematically improvable. We benchmark
the method against exact results for the Anderson impurity model, and provide
an outlook for more complex models beyond reach of existing methods.

<h3>Multi-Dirac and Weyl physics in heavy-fermion systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13607" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13607</a>
<br>
<i>Joelson F. Silva, E. Miranda</i>
<p>We have studied multi-Dirac/Weyl systems with arbitrary topological charge n
in the presence of a lattice of local magnetic moments. To do so, we propose a
multi-Dirac/Weyl Kondo lattice model which is analyzed through a mean-field
approach appropriate to the paramagnetic phase. We study both the broken
time-reversal and the broken inversion-symmetry Weyl cases. The multi- Dirac
and broken-time reversal multi-Weyl cases have similar behavior, which is in
contrast to the broken-parity case. For the former, low-energy particle-hole
symmetry leads to the emergence of a critical coupling constant below which
there is no Kondo quenching, reminiscent of the pseudogap Kondo impurity
problem. Away from particle-hole symmetry, there is always Kondo quenching. For
the broken inversion symmetry, there is no critical coupling. Depending on the
conduction electron filling, Kondo insulator, heavy fermion metal or semimetal
phases can be realized. In the last two cases, quasiparticle renormalizations
can differ widely between opposite chirality sectors, with characteristic
dependences on microscopic parameters that could in principle be detected
experimentally.

<h3>Current-Driven Domain Wall Motion in Curved Ferrimagnetic Strips Above  and Below the Angular Momentum Compensation</h3>

<br>
<i>David Osuna Ruiz, Óscar Alejos, Víctor Raposo, Eduardo Martínez</i>
<p>Current driven domain wall motion in curved Heavy Metal/Ferrimagnetic/Oxide
multilayer strips is investigated using systematic micromagnetic simulations
which account for spin-orbit coupling phenomena. Domain wall velocity and
characteristic relaxation times are studied as functions of the geometry,
curvature and width of the strip, at and out of the angular momentum
compensation. Results show that domain walls can propagate faster and without a
significant distortion in such strips in contrast to their ferromagnetic
counterparts. Using an artificial system based on a straight strip with an
equivalent current density distribution, we can discern its influence on the
wall terminal velocity, as part of a more general geometrical influence due to
the curved shape. Curved and narrow ferrimagnetic strips are promising
candidates for designing high speed and fast response spintronic circuitry
based on current-driven domain wall motion.

ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A=Rb, Cs) in magnetic fields up to 41.5 T and temperatures down

observed multiple unreported frequencies above 2000 T in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ using a
tunnel diode oscillator technique. We compare these results against density
functional theory calculations and find good agreement with the calculations in
the number of peaks observed, frequency, and the dimensionality of the Fermi
surface. For RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ we have obtained a different quantum oscillation
spectrum, although calculated quantum oscillation frequencies for the Rb
compound are remarkably similar to the Cs compound, calling for further
studies.

<h3>Inorganic/inorganic composites through emulsion templating</h3>

<i>Tianhui Jiang, Shitong Zhou, Yinglun Hong, Erik Poloni, Eduardo Saiz, Florian Bouville</i>
<p>Inorganic/inorganic composites are found in multiple applications crucial for
the energy transition, from nuclear reactor to energy storage devices. Their
microstructures dictate a number of properties, such as mass transport or
fracture resistance. There has been a multitude of process developed to control
the microstructure of inorganic/inorganic composites, from powder mixing and
the use of short or long fibre, to tape casting for laminates up to recently 3D
printing. Here, we combined emulsions and slip casting into a simpler, broadly
available, inexpensive processing platform that allow for in situ control of a
composite's microstructure that also enables complex shaping. Emulsions are
used to form droplets of controllable size of one inorganic phase into another,
while slip casting enable 3D shaping of the final part. Our study shows that
slip casting emulsions trigger a two-steps solvent removal that opens the
possibility for conformal coating of porosity. By making magnetically
responsive droplets, we form inorganic fibre inside an inorganic matrix during
slip casting, demonstrating a simple fabrication for long-fibre reinforced
composites. We exemplify the potential of this processing platform by making
strong and lightweight alumina scaffolds reinforced by a confirmed zirconia
coating and alumina with metallic iron fibres that displays work of fracture an
order of magnitude higher than alumina.
