<p>We systematically derive relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics based on the
method of quantum nonlinear projection operator. Morozov's nonlinear projection
operator is a generalization of the well-known linear Mori-Zwanzig projection
operator method, from which one can account for the nonlinear interaction
between macroscopic modes. The quantum generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin
equations are also obtained using this formalism, which are fundamentally
important in non-equilibrium statistical physics. As an application, the
relativistic stochastic hydrodynamic equations with Gaussian noises are
derived, which are applicable in studying anomalous transport phenomena near

<h3>Entanglement signatures of a percolating quantum system</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15541" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15541</a>

</p><i>Subrata Pachhal, Adhip Agarwala</i>
<p>Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose
quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their
applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In
this work, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder,
free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties.
These emerge from massively degenerate eigenspaces where the notion of standard
bipartite entanglement entropy needs to be revisited. We show that
appropriately defined entanglement measures can capture both geometrical
aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. Using a
variety of toy models, we uncover the rich phenomenology of this physics. We
further show that there are decipherable signatures of the classical
percolation transition in these entanglement properties. Our work presents an
interesting interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and
quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.

<h3>Bridging the small and large in twisted transition metal dicalcogenide  homobilayers: a tight binding model capturing orbital interference and  topology across a wide range of twist angles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15546</a>
<br>
</p><i>Valentin Crépel, Andrew Millis</i>
<p>Many of the important phases observed in twisted transition metal
dichalcogenide homobilayers are driven by short-range interactions, which
should be captured by a local tight binding description since no Wannier
obstruction exists for these systems. Yet, published theoretical descriptions
have been mutually inconsistent, with honeycomb lattice tight binding models
adopted for some twist angles, triangular lattice models adopted for others,
and with tight binding models forsaken in favor of band projected continuum
models in many numerical simulations. Here, we derive and study a minimal model
containing both honeycomb orbitals and a triangular site that represents the
band physics across a wide range of twist angles. The model provides a natural
basis to study the interplay of interaction and topology in these
heterostructures. It elucidates from generic features of the bilayer the
sequence of Chern numbers occurring as twist angle is varied, and the
microscopic origin of the magic angle at which flat-band physics occurs. At
integer filling, the model successfully captures the Chern ferromagnetic and
van-Hove driven antiferromagnetic insulators experimentally observed for small
and large angles, respectively, and allows a straightforward calculation of the
magneto-electric properties of the system.

<h3>Spectral Initialization for High-Dimensional Phase Retrieval with Biased  Spatial Directions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15548" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15548</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pierre Bousseyroux, Marc Potters</i>
<p>We explore a spectral initialization method that plays a central role in
contemporary research on signal estimation in nonconvex scenarios. In a
noiseless phase retrieval framework, we precisely analyze the method's
performance in the high-dimensional limit when sensing vectors follow a
multivariate Gaussian distribution for two rotationally invariant models of the
covariance matrix C. In the first model C is a projector on a lower dimensional
space while in the second it is a Wishart matrix. Our analytical results extend
the well-established case when C is the identity matrix. Our examination shows
that the introduction of biased spatial directions leads to a substantial
improvement in the spectral method's effectiveness, particularly when the
number of measurements is less than the signal's dimension. This extension also
consistently reveals a phase transition phenomenon dependent on the ratio
between sample size and signal dimension. Surprisingly, both of these models
share the same threshold value.

<h3>Directional superradiance in a driven ultracold atomic gas in free-space</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15556</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sanaa Agarwal, Edwin Chaparro, Diego Barberena, A. Piñeiro Orioli, G. Ferioli, S. Pancaldi, I. Ferrier-Barbut, A. Browaeys, A. M. Rey</i>
<p>Ultra-cold atomic systems are among the most promising platforms that have
the potential to shed light on the complex behavior of many-body quantum
systems. One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a
strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite
being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open
questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported
measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective
effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when
looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by
the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis
of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength
and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak
drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system
evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned
dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported
superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative
resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative
differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter
(from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field
treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible
conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains
the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous
effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting
disordered arrays in free space.

</p><i>C. W. F. Freeman, Z. Xue, A.K. Budniak, H. De Libero, T. Thomson, M. Bosman, G. Eda, H. Kurebayashi, M. Cubukcu</i>
<p>Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons and the manipulation of magnetisation via
spin currents in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for
applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate
ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM,
achieving a remarkable maximum normalised coupling strength of 0.47. Our
investigation unveils the tunability of coupling strength through
temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. Additionally, we show the prospect
for further enhancement to the deep-strong magnon-magnon coupling regime by
manipulating the anisotropy. Furthermore, we report spin Hall magnetoresistance
in a vdW AFM-based device and study the field and temperature dependence. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of vdW AFMs in advancing the
field of spin-based technologies.

<h3>Efficient first principles based modeling via machine learning: from  simple representations to high entropy materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15579" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15579</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kangming Li, Kamal Choudhary, Brian DeCost, Michael Greenwood, Jason Hattrick-Simpers</i>
<p>High-entropy materials (HEMs) have recently emerged as a significant category
of materials, offering highly tunable properties. However, the scarcity of HEM
data in existing density functional theory (DFT) databases, primarily due to
computational expense, hinders the development of effective modeling strategies
for computational materials discovery. In this study, we introduce an open DFT
dataset of alloys and employ machine learning (ML) methods to investigate the
material representations needed for HEM modeling. Utilizing high-throughput DFT
calculations, we generate a comprehensive dataset of 84k structures,
encompassing both ordered and disordered alloys across a spectrum of up to
seven components and the entire compositional range. We apply descriptor-based
models and graph neural networks to assess how material information is captured
across diverse chemical-structural representations. We first evaluate the
in-distribution performance of ML models to confirm their predictive accuracy.
Subsequently, we demonstrate the capability of ML models to generalize between
ordered and disordered structures, between low-order and high-order alloys, and
between equimolar and non-equimolar compositions. Our findings suggest that ML
models can generalize from cost-effective calculations of simpler systems to
more complex scenarios. Additionally, we discuss the influence of dataset size
and reveal that the information loss associated with the use of unrelaxed
structures could significantly degrade the generalization performance. Overall,
this research sheds light on several critical aspects of HEM modeling and
offers insights for data-driven atomistic modeling of HEMs.

<h3>Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing  units</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15582" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15582</a>
<br>
</p><i>Juntian Tu, Sarthak Subhankar</i>
<p>Real-time Arbitrary Waveform Generation (AWG) is essential in various
engineering and research applications, and often requires complex bespoke
hardware and software. This paper introduces an AWG framework using an NVIDIA
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed
Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal
computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data parallel additive
waveform synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated
waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG framework is programmed
using the developer-friendly Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) runtime
application programming interface from NVIDIA and is readily customizable, and
scalable with additional parallel hardware. We present and characterize two
different pathways for computing modulated radio-frequency (rf) waveforms: one
pathway offers high-complexity simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual
Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones for 35 ms at a sampling rate of 560
MB/s, and the other pathway allows simultaneous continuous chirping of 194
individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 100 MB/s, or 20 individual
tones at 560 MB/s. This AWG framework is designed for fast on-the-fly
rearrangement of a large stochastically-loaded optical tweezer array of single
atoms or molecules into a defect-free array needed for quantum simulation and
quantum computation applications.

<h3>Electrically Switchable Circular Photogalvanic Effect in Methylammonium  Lead Iodide Microcrystals</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yuqing Zhu, Ziyi Song, Rodrigo Becerra Silva, Bob Minyu Wang, Henry Clark Travaglini, Andrew C Grieder, Yuan Ping, Liang Z. Tan, Dong Yu</i>
<p>We investigate the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in single-crystalline
methylammonium lead iodide microcrystals under a static electric field. The
external electric field can enhance the magnitude of the helicity dependent
photocurrent (HDPC) by two orders of magnitude and flip its sign, which we
attribute to magnetic shift currents induced by the Rashba-Edelstein effect.
This HDPC induced by the static electric field may be viewed as an unusually
strong third-order photoresponse, which produces a current two orders of
magnitude larger than second-order injection current. Furthermore, the HDPC is
highly nonlocal and can be created by photoexcitation out of the device
channel, indicating a spin diffusion length up to 50 $\mu$m at 78 K.

<h3>Integrated workflows and interfaces for data-driven semi-empirical  electronic structure calculations</h3>

<p>Modern software engineering of electronic structure codes has seen a paradigm
shift from monolithic workflows towards object-based modularity. Software
objectivity allows for greater flexibility in the application of electronic
structure calculations, with particular benefits when integrated with
approaches for data-driven analysis. Here, we discuss different approaches to
create "deep" modular interfaces that connect big-data workflows and electronic
structure codes, and explore the diversity of use cases that they can enable.
We present two such interface approaches for the semi-empirical electronic
structure package, DFTB+. In one case, DFTB+ is applied as a library and
provides data to an external workflow; and in another, DFTB+ receives data via
external bindings and processes the information subsequently within an internal
workflow. We provide a general framework to enable data exchange workflows for
embedding new machine-learning-based Hamiltonians within DFTB+, or to enabling
deep integration of DFTB+ in multiscale embedding workflows. These modular
interfaces demonstrate opportunities in emergent software and workflows to
accelerate scientific discovery by harnessing existing software capabilities.

<p>Topologically-engineered mechanical frames are important model constructs for
architecture, machine mechanisms, and metamaterials. Despite significant
advances in macroscopically fashioned frames, realization and phonon imaging of
nanoframes have remained challenging. Here we extend for the first time the
principles of topologically-engineered mechanical frames to lattices
self-assembled from nanoparticles. Liquid-phase transmission electron
microscopy images the vibrations of nanoparticles in self-assembled Maxwell and
hexagonal lattices at the nanometer resolution, measuring a series of otherwise
inaccessible properties such as phonon spectra and nonlinear lattice
deformation paths. These properties are experimentally modulated by ionic
strength, captured by our discrete mechanical model considering the complexity
of nanoscale interactions and thermal fluctuations. The experiment-theory
integration bridges mechanical metamaterials and colloidal self-assembly,
opening new opportunities to manufacture phononic devices with solution
processibility, transformability, light weight, and emergent functions, at
underexplored length, frequency, and energy scales.

<h3>Controllable Freezing Transparency for Water Ice on Scalable Graphene  Films on Copper</h3>

<p>Control of water ice formation on surfaces is of key technological and
economic importance, but the fundamental understanding of ice nucleation and
growth mechanisms and the design of surfaces for controlling water freezing
behaviour remain incomplete. Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) material that
has been extensively studied for its peculiar wetting properties with liquid
water incl. a heavily debated wetting transparency. Furthermore, graphene is
the parent structure of soot particles that are heavily implicated as nuclei in
atmospheric ice formation and consequently graphene is often used as a model
surface for computational ice nucleation studies. Despite this, to date
experimental reports on ice formation on scalable graphene films remain
missing. Towards filling this gap, we here report on the water freezing
behaviour on scalably grown chemical vapour deposited (CVD) graphene films on
application-relevant polycrystalline copper (Cu). We find that as-grown CVD
graphene on Cu can be (as we term it) freezing transparent i.e. the graphene
presence does not change the freezing temperature curves of liquid water to
solid ice on Cu in our measurements. Such freezing transparency has to date not
been considered. We also show that chemical functionalization of the graphene
films can result in controllable changes to the freezing behaviour to
lower/higher temperatures and that also the observed freezing transparency can
be lifted via functionalization. Our work thereby introduces the concept of
freezing transparency of graphene on a metal support and also introduces
scalable CVD graphene/Cu as an ultimately thin platform towards control of ice
nucleation behaviour on a technologically highly relevant metal.

<h3>Magnetic parity violation and parity-time-reversal-symmetric magnets</h3>

</p><i>Hikaru Watanabe, Youichi Yanase</i>
<p>Parity-time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry), a symmetry for the
combined operations of space inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) and time reversal
($\mathcal{T}$), is a fundamental concept of physics and characterizes the
functionality of materials as well as $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$
symmetries. In particular, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems can be found in
the centrosymmetric crystals undergoing the parity-violating magnetic order
which we call the odd-parity magnetic multipole order. While this spontaneous
order leaves $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry intact, the simultaneous violation of
$\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries gives rise to various emergent
responses that are qualitatively different from those allowed by the
nonmagnetic $\mathcal{P}$-symmetry breaking or by the ferromagnetic order. In
this review, we introduce candidates hosting the intriguing spontaneous order
and overview the characteristic physical responses. Various off-diagonal and/or
nonreciprocal responses are identified, which are closely related to the
unusual electronic structures such as hidden spin-momentum locking and
asymmetric band dispersion.

<h3>An Anisotropic Constitutive Relationship by a Series of 8 Chain Models</h3>

</p><i>Libin Yang, Teng Long, Lixiang Yang</i>
<p>Hyperelastic models have been widely used to model polymers and soft tissues.
However, most hyperelastic models are phenomenological material models. Based
on statistical mechanics and molecular chain configuration, 8 chain model or
Arruda-Boyce model is a physical model which can be used to understand how
microstructures of chains affect macroscopic mechanical properties of polymers
and soft tissues. Mechanical properties of many polymers and soft tissues are
directional dependent. Polymer matrix can be reinforced by fibers. For soft
tissues, ligaments and tendons will lead to anisotropic properties. Since
matrix and reinforcements are composed of similar microstructural molecular
chains, they can be modeled by using the same mathematical model. In this
paper, a series of 8 chain models is used to understand composite properties.
That is, an isotropic 8 chain model will be used to model matrix and
anisotropic 8 chain models will be used to model fibers. Replacing I_1 in
isotropic 8 chain model with I_4 in anisotropic 8 chain model is physically
corresponding to changing representative 8 chain cubic cell to 8 chain slender
cell. This treatment not only simplifies exist anisotropic mathematical
structures but also keeps microscopic physics of 8 chain model unchanged.

<h3>Coexistence of distinct nonuniform nonequilibrium steady states in  Ehrenfest multiurn model on a ring</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15708" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15708</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chi-Ho Cheng, Pik-Yin Lai</i>
<p>The recently proposed Ehrenfest M-urn model with interactions on a ring is
considered as a paradigm model which can exhibit a variety of distinct
nonequilibrium steady states. Unlike the previous three-urn model on a ring
which consists of a uniform steady state and a nonuniform nonequilibrium steady
state, it is found that for even M>=4, an additional nonequilibrium steady
state can coexist with the original ones. Detailed analysis reveals that this
additional nonequilibrium steady state emerged via a pitchfork bifurcation
which cannot occur if M is odd. Properties of this nonequilibrium steady state,
such as stability, and steady-state flux are derived analytically for the
four-urn case. The full phase diagram with the phase boundaries is also derived
explicitly. The associated thermodynamic stability is also analyzed, confirming
its stability. These theoretical results are also explicitly verified by direct
Monte Carlo simulations for the three-urn and four-urn ring models.

<h3>Customizable wave tailoring materials enabled by coupling nonlinear  inverse design at two scales</h3>

</p><i>Brianna MacNider, Haning Xiu, Kai Qian, Ian Frankel, Hyunsun Alicia Kim, Nicholas Boechler</i>
<p>Passive transformation of waves via nonlinear systems is ubiquitous in
settings ranging from acoustics to optics and electromagnetics. Passivity is of
particular importance for responding rapidly to stimuli, and nonlinearity
enormously expands signal transformability compared to linear systems due to
the breaking of superposition. It is well known that different types of
nonlinearity yield vastly and qualitatively different effects on propagating
signals, which raises the question of what precise nonlinearity is the best for
a given wave tailoring application? This question has largely remained in the
regime of simulation and theory, as, until recently it has not been possible to
freely choose any optimal nonlinearity (instead relying on limited tunability
around known nonlinear mechanisms). Herein, we leverage recent advances in
mechanics, wherein desired nonlinear constitutive responses can be achieved
through shape optimization, and couple this to a larger-scale, reduced-order
nonlinear dynamical inverse design step. Using minimization of kinetic energy
transmission from impact as a case study, we identify ideal nonlinear
constitutive responses and the geometries needed to achieve them within a
single design process. As part of this, we show the large sensitivity of this
metric to small changes in nonlinearity, and thus the need for high precision,
free-form nonlinearity tailoring. We validate our predictions using impact
experiments in a chain of nonlinear springs and masses. This work sets the
foundation for broader passive nonlinear mechanical wave tailoring material
design, including future incorporation of higher-dimensionality,
irreversibility, material heterogenity, and coupled physics. Potential
applications include mechanical computing, acoustic signal and image
processing, impact mitigation, and materials that autonomously respond and do
work via rapid shape-change.

<h3>Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Zhendong Cao, Xiaoshan Luo, Jian Lv, Lei Wang</i>
<p>We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model
specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline
materials. The space group symmetry significantly simplifies the crystal space,
which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of
crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature
of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly
predicting the species and locations of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit
cell. Our results demonstrate that CrystalFormer matches state-of-the-art
performance on standard benchmarks for both validity, novelty, and stability of
the generated crystalline materials. Our analysis also shows that CrystalFormer
ingests sensible solid-state chemistry information from data for generative
modeling. The CrystalFormer unifies symmetry-based structure search and
generative pre-training in the realm of crystalline materials. The simplicity,
generality, and flexibility of CrystalFormer position it as a promising
architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials
space, heralding a new era in materials modeling and discovery.

<h3>The role of rare-earth atoms in the anisotropy and antiferromagnetic  exchange coupling at a hybrid metal-organic interface</h3>

<p>Magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions are crucial parameters
that characterize the hybrid metal-organic interface, key component of an
organic spintronic device. We show that the incorporation of 4$f$ RE atoms to
hybrid metal-organic interfaces of CuPc/REAu$_2$ type (RE= Gd, Ho) constitutes
a feasible approach towards on-demand magnetic properties and functionalities.
The GdAu$_2$ and HoAu$_2$ substrates differ in their magnetic anisotropy
behavior. Remarkably, the HoAu$_2$ surface boosts the inherent out-of-plane
anisotropy of CuPc, owing to the match between the anisotropy axis of substrate
and molecule. Furthermore, the presence of RE atoms leads to a spontaneous
antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling at the interface, induced by the
3$d$-4$f$ superexchange interaction between the unpaired 3$d$ electron of CuPc
and the 4$f$ electrons of the RE atoms. We show that 4$f$ RE atoms with
unquenched quantum orbital momentum ($L$), as it is the case of Ho, induce an
anisotropic interfacial exchange coupling.

</p><i>Cesar E. P. Villegas, Alexandre R. Rocha</i>
<p>The optical response of quasi-one-dimensional systems is often dominated by
tightly bound excitons, that significantly influence their basic electronic
properties. Despite their importance for device performance, accurately
predicting their excitonic effects typically requires computationally demanding
many-body approaches. Here, we present a simplified model to describe the
static macroscopic dielectric function, which depends only on the width of the
quasi-one-dimensional system and its polarizability per unit length. We show
that at certain interaction distances, the screened Coulomb potential is
greater than its bare counterpart, which results from the enhanced repulsive
electron-electron interactions. As a test case, we study fourteen different
nanoribbons, twelve of them armchair graphene nanoribbons of different
families. Initially, we devised a simplified equation to estimate the exciton
binding energy and extension that provides results comparable to those from the
full Bethe-Salpeter equation, albeit for a specific nanoribbon family. Then, we
used our proposed screening potential to solve the 1D Wannier-Mott equation,
which turn out to be broad approach, that is able to predict binding energies
that match quite well the ones obtained with the Bethe-Salpeter equation,
irrespective of the nanoribbon family.

<h3>Combining genetic algorithm and compressed sensing for features and  operators selection in symbolic regression</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15816" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15816</a>

</p><i>Aliaksei Mazheika, Sergey V. Levchenko, Luca M. Ghiringhelli</i>
<p>Symbolic-inference methods have recently found a broad application in
materials science. In particular, the Sure-Independence Screening and
Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) performs symbolic regression and classification by
adopting compressed sensing for the selection of an optimized subset of
features and mathematical operators out of a given set of candidates. However,
SISSO becomes computationally unpractical when the set of candidate features
and operators exceeds the size of few tens. In the present work, we combine
SISSO with a genetic algorithm (GA) for the global search of the optimal subset
of features and operators. We demonstrate that GA-SISSO efficiently finds more
accurate predictive models than the original SISSO, due to the possibility to
access a larger input feature and operator space. GA-SISSO was applied for the
search of the model for the prediction of carbon-dioxide adsorption energies on
semiconductor oxides. The obtained with GA-SISSO model has much higher accuracy
compared to models previously discussed in the literature (based solely on the
O 2p-band center). The analysis of features importance shows that, besides the
O 2p-band center, the contribution of the electrostatic potential above
adsorption sites and the surface formation energies are also important.

<p>Bilinear magnetoresistance has been studied theoretically in 2D systems with
isotropic cubic form of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We have derived the
effective spin-orbital field due to current-induced spin polarization and
discussed its contribution to the unidirectional system response. The analysed

<h3>Probing marginal stability in the spherical $p=2$ model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jacopo Niedda, Tommaso Tonolo, Giacomo Gradenigo</i>
<p>In this paper we investigate the marginally stable nature of the
low-temperature trivial spin glass phase in the spherical $p=2$ spin glass, by
perturbing the system with three different kinds of non-linear interactions. In
particular, we compare the effect of three additional dense four-body
interactions: ferromagnetic couplings, purely disordered couplings and
couplings with competing disordered and ferromagnetic interactions. Our study,
characterized by the effort to present in a clear and pedagogical way the
derivation of all the results, shows that the marginal stability property of
the spherical spin glass depends in fact on which kind of perturbation is
applied to the system: in general, a certain degree of frustration is needed
also in the additional terms in order to induce a transition from a trivial to
a non-trivial spin-glass phase. On the contrary, the addition of generic
non-frustrated interactions does not destabilize the trivial spin-glass phase.

<h3>The fractional quantum Hall nematics on the first Landau level in a  tilted field</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15820" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15820</a>
<br>
</p><i>Dan Ye, Chen-Xin Jiang, Zi-Xiang Hu</i>
<p>We investigated the behavior of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a
two-dimensional electron system with layer thickness and an in-plane magnetic
field. Our comparisons across various filling factors within the first Landau
level revealed a crucial observation. A slight in-plane magnetic field
specifically enhances the nematic order of the $\nu = 7/3$ FQH state. For this
particular filling, through calculating the energy gap, the Ising nematic order
parameter, the pair-correlation function, and the static structure factor, we
observed that as the in-plane magnetic field increases, the system first enters
into an anisotropic FQH phase without closing the spectrum gap, then the FQH
nematic (FQHN) phase after neutral gap closing. The system eventually enters a
gapless one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) phase for a large in-plane
field. We thus provide a full phase diagram of the $\nu = 7/3$ state in a
tilted magnetic field, demonstrating the existence of the FQHN, which aligns
with recent resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) experimental
observations.

<h3>Ferromagnetic Ising model on the hierarchical pentagon lattice</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Takumi Oshima, Tomotoshi Nishino</i>
<p>Thermodynamic properties of the ferromagnetic Ising model on the hierarchical
pentagon lattice is studied by means of the tensor network methods. The lattice
consists of pentagons, where 3 or 4 of them meet at each vertex. Correlation
functions on the surface of the system up to n = 10 layers are evaluated by
means of the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) method, and the power low
decay is observed in the high temperature region. The recursive structure of
the lattice enables complemental numerical study for larger systems, by means
of a variant of the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG)
method. Calculated spin expectation value shows that there is a mean-field type
order-disorder transition at T1 = 1.58 on the surface of the system. On the
other hand, the bulk part exhibits the transition at T2 = 2.269. Consistency of
these calculated results is examined.

<h3>Fractal ground state of ion chains in periodic potentials</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Raphaël Menu, Jorge Yago Malo, Vladan Vuletić, Maria Luisa Chiofalo, Giovanna Morigi</i>
<p>Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner
crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The
classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin
chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is
determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity.
The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic
potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with
the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic
structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also
on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the
thermodynamic limit for $\alpha>1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it
disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However,
due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of
the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We
discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to
observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics
are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the
interplay between frustration and interactions.

<h3>Engineering the electronic and magnetic properties of monolayer TiS$_2$  through systematic transition-metal doping</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15850</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sara Asadi Toularoud, Hanif Hadipour, Hamid Rahimpour Soleimani</i>
<p>Layered materials that exhibit magnetic ordering in their pristine form are
very rare. Several standard approaches, such as adsorption of atoms,
introduction of point defects, and edge engineering, have been developed to
induce magnetism in two-dimensional materials. In this way, we investigate the
electronic and magnetic properties of monolayer TiS$_2$ doped with 3$d$
transition metals (TMs) atoms in both octahedral 1T and trigonal prismatic 1H
structures using first-principles calculations. In its pristine form, TiS$_2$
is a non-magnetic semiconductor. The bands near the Fermi energy primarily
exhibit $d$ orbital characters, and due to the presence of ideal octahedral and
trigonal arrangements, they are well separated from other bands with $p$
character. Upon substituting 3$d$-TM atoms in both structures, a variety of
electronic and magnetic phases emerge, including magnetic semiconductor,
magnetic half-metal, non-magnetic metal, and magnetic metal. Chromium exhibits
the largest magnetic moment in both the 1T and 1H structures. The 1T structure
shows a slightly higher magnetic moment of 3.419 $\mu_B$ compared to the 1H
structure 3.138 $\mu_B$, attributed to the distorted octahedral structure of
the 1T structure. Unlike pristine TiS$_2$, the deficiency in saturation of
neighboring S atoms in the presence of impurities leads to the proximity of
energy levels of $d$ and $p$ states, resulting in unexpectedly sizable magnetic
moments. Another interesting case is Cobalt, which leads to a magnetic moment
of approximately 0.805 $\mu_B$ in the 1H structure, while the Co exhibits a
non-magnetic state in the 1H structure. These materials demonstrate a high
degree of tunability and can be optimized for various magnetic applications.

<h3>Self-organised dynamics beyond scaling of avalanches: Cyclic stress  fluctuations in critical sandpiles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15859" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15859</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bosiljka Tadic, Alexander Shapoval, Mikhail Shnirman</i>
<p>Recognising changes in collective dynamics in complex systems is essential
for predicting potential events and their development. Possessing intrinsic
attractors with laws associated with scale invariance, self-organised critical
dynamics represent a suitable example for quantitatively studying changes in
collective behaviour. We consider two prototypal models of self-organised
criticality, the sandpile automata with deterministic (Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld) and
probabilistic (Manna model) dynamical rules, focusing on the nature of stress
fluctuations induced by driving - adding grains during the avalanche
propagation, and dissipation through avalanches that hit the system boundary.
Our analysis of stress evolution time series reveals robust cycles modulated by
collective fluctuations with dissipative avalanches. These modulated cycles are
multifractal within a broad range of time scales. Features of the associated
singularity spectra capture the differences in the dynamic rules behind the
self-organised critical states and their response to the increased driving
rate, altering the process stochasticity and causing a loss of avalanche
scaling. In the related sequences of outflow current, the first return
distributions are found to follow modified laws that describe different
pathways to the gradual loss of cooperative behaviour in these two models. The
spontaneous appearance of cycles is another characteristic of self-organised
criticality. It can also help identify the prominence of self-organisational
phenomenology in an empirical time series when underlying interactions and
driving modes remain hidden.

<p>Designing polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) is
critically important for the thermal management of organic electronics and
photonics. However, this is a challenging task owing to the diversity of the
chemical space and the barriers to advanced synthetic
experiments/characterization techniques for polymers. In this Tutorial, the
fundamentals and implementation of combining classical molecular dynamics
simulation and machine learning (ML) for the development of polymers with high
TC are comprehensively introduced. We begin by describing the core components
of a universal ML framework, involving polymer datasets, property calculators,
feature engineering and informatics algorithms. Then, the process of
constructing interpretable regression algorithms for TC prediction is
introduced, aiming to extract the underlying relationships between
microstructures and TCs for polymers. We also explore the design of
sequence-ordered polymers with high TC using lightweight and mainstream active
learning algorithms. Lastly, we conclude by addressing the current limitations
and suggesting potential avenues for future research on this topic.

<p>A linear regression-based machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) was
developed for the silicon-carbon system. The MLIP was predominantly trained on
structures discovered through a genetic algorithm, encompassing the entire
silicon-carbon composition space, and uses as its foundation the Ultra-Fast
Force Fields (UF3) formulation. To improve MLIP performance, the learning
algorithm was modified to include higher spline interpolation resolution in
regions with large potential energy surface curvature. The developed MLIP
demonstrates exceptional predictive performance, accurately estimating energies
and forces for structures across the silicon-carbon composition and
configuration space. The MLIP predicts mechanical properties of SiC with high
precision and captures fundamental volume-pressure and volume-temperature
relationships. Uniquely, this silicon-carbon MLIP is adept at modeling complex
high-temperature phenomena, including the peritectic decomposition of SiC and
carbon dimer formation during SiC surface reconstruction, which cannot be
captured with prior classical interatomic potentials for this material.

<p>The convergence of topology and correlations represents a highly coveted
realm in the pursuit of novel quantum states of matter. Introducing electron
correlations to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator can lead to the emergence
of a fractional topological insulator and other exotic time-reversal-symmetric
topological order, not possible in quantum Hall and Chern insulator systems.
However, the QSH insulator with quantized edge conductance remains rare, let
alone that with significant correlations. In this work, we report a novel dual
QSH insulator within the intrinsic monolayer crystal of TaIrTe4, arising from
the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron
correlations. At charge neutrality, monolayer TaIrTe4 demonstrates the QSH
insulator that aligns with single-particle band structure calculations,
manifesting enhanced nonlocal transport and quantized helical edge conductance.
Interestingly, upon introducing electrons from charge neutrality, TaIrTe4 only
shows metallic behavior in a small range of charge densities but quickly goes
into a new insulating state, entirely unexpected based on TaIrTe4's
single-particle band structure. This insulating state could arise from a strong
electronic instability near the van Hove singularities (VHS), likely leading to
a charge density wave (CDW). Remarkably, within this correlated insulating gap,
we observe a resurgence of the QSH state, marked by the revival of nonlocal
transport and quantized helical edge conduction. Our observation of helical
edge conduction in a CDW gap could bridge spin physics and charge orders. The
discovery of a dual QSH insulator introduces a new method for creating
topological flat minibands via CDW superlattices, which offer a promising
platform for exploring time-reversal-symmetric fractional phases and
electromagnetism.

<p>We perform a calculation of the uniform conductivity of one-dimensional
degenerate fermion system with some large-scaled disorder. We use the nonlinear
Luttinger liquid model. The only important limitation is that the frequency has
to be large enough. Apart from that and few other minor constraints, the
calculation is fairly general. For instance, we neither assume the interaction
to be point-like nor weak. As a result, we obtain conductivity across a wide
range of parameters, the parameters are the disorder scale, frequency,

<p>In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structures (Density

Augmented plane Wave (SLAPW) basis sets by allowing variable radii for the
different angular momentum channels and wave vectors. This allows to match
additional derivatives of the wave function at the Muffin Tin (MT) radius
without having to resort to additional higher derivative terms. This should
lead to low wave vector basis set and low linearization energy errors. We dub
these basis sets SAPWMR and SLAPWMR. Similarly Local orbital (LO and lo) basis
wave functions are suggested with a variable radius. Full Potential Hamiltonian
calculations (FLAPW) are extended to FSLAPWMR full potential calculations in

ideal gas. We obtain the exact work distribution and verify the Jarzynski's
equality. In the non-relativistic limit, our results recover the
non-relativistic results [arXiv:cond-mat/0502434]. We also find that, unlike
the non-relativistic case, the work distribution no longer has zeros and the
number of collisions in this relativistic gas model is finite. In addition,
based on an analysis of the experimental parameters, we conclude that it is
difficult to detect the relativistic effects of the work distribution of the
ideal gas in a piston system with the current experimental techniques.

</p><i>Toranosuke Matsubara, Akihisa Koga, Atsushi Takano, Yushu Matsushita, Tomonari Dotera</i>
<p>Aperiodic crystals constitute a fascinating class of materials that includes
incommensurate (IC) modulated structures and quasicrystals (QCs). Although
these two categories share a common foundation in the concept of superspace,
the relationship between them has remained enigmatic and largely unexplored.
Here, we show "any metallic-mean" QCs, surpassing the confines of Penrose-like
structures, and explore their connection with IC modulated structures. In
contrast to periodic approximants of QCs, our work introduces the pivotal role
of "aperiodic approximants", articulated through a series of $k$-th
metallic-mean tilings serving as aperiodic approximants for the honeycomb
crystal, while simultaneously redefining this tiling as a metallic-mean IC
modulated structure, highlighting the intricate interplay between these
crystallographic phenomena. We extend our findings to real-world applications,
discovering these unique tiles in a terpolymer/homopolymer blend and applying
our QC theory to a colloidal simulation displaying planar IC structures. In
these structures, domain walls are viewed as essential components of a
quasicrystal, introducing additional dimensions in superspace. Our research
provides a fresh perspective on the intricate world of aperiodic crystals,
shedding light on their broader implications for domain wall structures across
various fields.

$\mathbb{Z}_2$ elements, the BPM not only encapsulates the essence of KW
duality but also enables exploration of a broader spectrum of generalized
quantum phases and dualities. By analyzing the BPM's linear algebraic
properties, we elucidate the loss of unitarity in duality transformations and
derive general non-invertible fusion rules. Applying this framework to (1+1)D
systems yields the discovery of new dualities, shedding light on the interplay
between various Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) and Spontaneous Symmetry
Breaking (SSB) phases. Additionally, we construct a duality web that
interconnects these phases and their transitions, offering valuable insights
into relations between different quantum phases.

<p>Electrical switching of magnetization is central to spintronics. Despite the
enormous efforts on the spin torques and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI) effects, some fundamental physics for electrical switching of
magnetization is still missing as indicated by a number of remarkable
long-standing puzzles. Here, we report the discovery of the long-range
intralayer DMI effect widely existing in magnetic heterostructure, which is
distinct from the yet-known DMI effects as it describes the chiral coupling of
two orthogonal magnetic domains within the same magnetic layer via the
mediation of an adjacent heavy metal layer. The long-range intralayer DMI
generates a strong perpendicular effective magnetic field (H_DMI^z) on the
perpendicular magnetization. Characteristically, H_DMI^z varies with the
sign/magnitude of the interfacial DMI constant, the applied in-plane magnetic
fields, and the distribution of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The
long-range intralayer DMI results in striking consequences including the
strongly asymmetric current/field switching of perpendicular magnetization,
hysteresis loop shift of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of in-plane
direct current, and sharp, complete switching of perpendicular magnetization
purely by an in-plane magnetic field. Utilizing the long-range intralayer DMI
effect, we demonstrate programable, complete Boolean logic operations (i.e.,
AND, NAND, NOT, OR, and NOR) within a single spin-orbit torque device. These
results will stimulate the investigation of the long-range intralayer DMI
effect and its impacts on a variety of spintronic devices.

<p>In-plane anisotropic layered materials (ALMs), such as black phosphorus (BP),
exhibit unique angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy
characteristics, as attributed to birefringence, linear dichroism and complex
Raman tensor. Moreover, the ARPR intensity profiles of BP flakes deposited on
multilayer dielectrics are notably sensitive to their thickness, owing to
interference effects. The intricate anisotropic effects present challenges in
accurately predicting the ARPR intensity of BP flakes. In this study, we
propose a comprehensive strategy for predicting the ARPR intensity of BP flakes
by explicitly considering optical anisotropy, encompassing birefringence,
linear dichroism, and anisotropic cavity interference effects within
multilayered structures. Through this approach, we have identified the
intrinsic complex Raman tensors for phonon modes, independent of the BP flake
thickness. By leveraging this methodology, we have elucidated the flake
thickness-dependent effective complex Raman tensor elements, allowing for
precise prediction of the observed ARPR intensity profile for the BP flake.
This work provides a profound understanding of ARPR behaviors for ALM flakes.

<h3>Viscoelastic material properties determine contact mechanics of hydrogel  spheres</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Chandan Shakya, Jasper van der Gucht, Joshua A. Dijksman</i>
<p>Granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and industry; their mechanical
behavior has been of academic and engineering interest for centuries. One of
the reasons for their rather complex mechanical behavior is that stresses
exerted on a granular material propagate only through contacts between the
grains. These contacts can change as the packing evolves. This makes any
deformation and mechanical response from a granular packing a function of the
nature of contacts between the grains and the material response of the material
the grains are made of. We present a study in which we isolate the role of the
grain material in the contact forces acting between two particles sliding past
each other. We use hydrogel particles and find that a viscoelastic material
model, in which the shear modulus decays with time, coupled with a simple
Coulomb friction model captures the experimental results. The results suggest
that the particle material evolution itself may play a role in the collective
behavior of granular materials.

<p>Recently, the Kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ has exhibited several novel quantum
properties similar to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, such as nontrivial topology, double-dome
superconductivity, and flat band features. However, CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ lacks the
charge-density wave (CDW) present in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, making the study of its
emergence of double-dome superconductivity a focus of research. In this work,
we have identified an order parameter, the three-band Z$_2$ topological index,
that can describe the superconducting phase diagram of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under
pressure. Its evolution with pressure follows the expected behavior for
superconductivity. Furthermore, the results of the Fermi surface under pressure
reveal the potential presence of a Lifshitz transition in the vicinity of the
vanishing point of the superconducting temperature change with pressure in
CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. These results indicate that the superconducting behavior of
CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pressure is caused by changes in the electronic structure
leading to alterations in the topological properties, provide new insights and
approaches for understanding the superconducting phenomenon in Kagome metals.

<p>We consider a discrete-time random walk where a cost is incurred at each
jump. We obtain an exact analytical formula for the distribution of the total
cost of a trajectory until the process returns to the origin for the first
time. The formula is valid for arbitrary jump distribution and cost function
(heavy- and light-tailed alike), provided they are symmetric and continuous.
The tail behavior of the distribution is universal and independent of the
details of the model. Applications are given to the motion of an active
particle in one dimension and extensions to multiple cost variables are
considered. The analytical results are in perfect agreement with numerical
simulations.

<p>Realizing ideal Weyl semimetal state with a single pair of Weyl points has
been a long-sought goal in the field of topological semimetals. Here, we reveal
such a state in the Cr-based half-Heusler compounds XCrTe (X=K, Rb). We show
that these materials have a half metal ground state, with Fermi level crossing
only one spin channel. Importantly, the Fermi surface is clean, consisting of
the minimal number (i.e., a single pair) of spin-polarized Weyl points, so the
state represents an ideal Weyl half semimetal. We show that the locations of
the two Weyl points and the associated Chern vector can be flexibly tuned by
rotating the magnetization vector. The minimal surface Fermi arc pattern and
its contribution to anomalous Hall transport are discussed. Our finding offers
an ideal material platform for exploring magnetic Weyl fermions, which will
also facilitate the interplay between Weyl physics and spintronics.

rate constant of 0.289 min-1 in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX),
which was about 36 and 29 times that of single MoS2 (0.008 min-1) and
MIL-101(Fe) (0.01 min-1). Moreover, MMS with good stability and reusability
could reach 92% degradation of SMX after 5 cycles. Quenching experiments and
electron spin resonance (ESR) tests revealed that hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and
singlet oxygen (1O2) were the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SMX
degradation. The integration of experimental works, characterization techniques
and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unraveled that the formation
of sulfur vacancies in MMS catalyst could expose more Mo sites, improve the
charge density and boost the electron transfer, which was conducive to
accelerating the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle for enhancing the activation of PMS. Finally,
the C-N, N-O, S-N, C-O and C-S bonds of SMX were easily attacked by ROS to
generate the nontoxic intermediates in the MMS/PMS/SMX system. This study
offers a new approach to designing high-performance Fe-MoS2 catalysts for the
removal of organic pollutants.

<h3>AB5 type multicomponent TiVCoNiMn2 high-entropy alloy</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Abhishek Kumar, M. A. Shaz, N.K. Mukhopadhyay, Thakur Prasad Yadav</i>
<p>Recent theoretical and practical research has focused on multi-component High
Entropy Alloys (HEAs), which have superior mechanical and functional properties
than standard alloys based on a single major element, thereby establishing a
new field. A multi-component HEA contains five or more primary elements at
concentrations ranging from 5 to 35 atomic percent. We examined the
microstructure and mechanical properties of TiVCoNiMn2 HEA. The mixing enthalpy
and other thermodynamic parameters were determined using Meidma's model.
TiVCoNiMn2 exhibits a mixing enthalpy of -15.6 kJ/mol and an atomic radius
mismatch of approximately 10.03%. HEA is derived from both hydride and
non-hydride-producing elements. This could be a useful hydrogen storage
material. The hydrogen absorption/desorption capabilities of these HEAs are
promising.

<h3>Long-lived, pulse-induced absorption in  $\mathrm{LiNb}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ta}_x\mathrm{O}_3$ solid solutions: the case of  three intrinsic defect sites for electron localization with strong coupling</h3>

<p>Femto-/nanosecond pulse-induced, red and near-infrared absorption is studied
in $\mathrm{LiNb}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\mathrm{O}_3$ (LNT) solid solutions with
the goal to probe the intrinsic defect structure via the formation, transport
and recombination of optically generated small bound electron polarons with
strong coupling to the lattice. As a result, long-lived transients are
uncovered for LNT which exceed lifetimes of LN and LT by a factor of up to 100
over the entire range of investigated compositions. At the same time, the
starting amplitude varies in the range of
$\alpha_\mathrm{li}^0\approx10-100\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ as a function of $x$ and
exceed the ones of LN and LT by a factor of up to ten. The results are
interpreted in the model of three-dimensional small polaron hopping transport
considering the simultaneous presence of three different types of small bound
polarons, in particular of small electron $\mathrm{Nb}_\mathrm{Li}^{4+}$ and
$\mathrm{Ta}_\mathrm{Li}^{4+}$ antisite polarons, and of small electron
$\mathrm{Ta}_\mathrm{V}^{4+}$ interstitial polarons. We conclude that the
differences between LNT, LN, and LT may point to model systems that consist of
one (LN), two (LT) and three (LNT) intrinsic defect centers for electron
localization.

<h3>The nontrivial effects of annealing on superconducting properties of Nb  single crystals</h3>

<p>The effect of annealing on the superconducting properties of niobium single
crystals cut from the same master boule was studied by local and global
magnetic measurements, as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The
formation of large hydride precipitates was observed in unannealed samples. The
variation in structural and magnetic properties was studied after annealing
under high vacuum at 800 C, 1400 C, and near the melting point of niobium (2477
C) for a few seconds. The initial samples had a high hydrogen content.
Polarized optics and magneto-optical studies show that the formation of large
niobium hydride precipitates is suppressed already by 800 C annealing. However,
the overall superconducting properties in the annealed samples did not improve
after annealing, and in fact, worsened. The superconducting transition
temperature decreased, the upper critical field increased, and the pinning
strength increased. Parallel studies were conducted using STM, where the sample
was annealed initially at 400 C, measured, annealed again at 1700 C, and
measured again. These studies revealed a ``dirty'' superconducting gap with a
significant spatial variation of tunneling conductance after annealing at 400
C. The clean gap was recovered after annealing at 1700 C. It is likely that
these results are due to oxygen redistribution near the surface, which is
always covered by oxide layers in as-grown crystals. Overall, the results
indicate that vacuum annealing at least up to 1400 C, while expected to remove
a large amount of hydrogen, introduces additional nanosized defects, perhaps
hydride precipitates, that act as efficient pair-breaking and pinning centers.

<h3>Electron Thermometry</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Joost van der Heijden</i>
<p>The performance and accuracy of quantum electronics is substantially degraded
when the temperature of the electrons in the devices is too high. The electron
temperature can be reduced with appropriate thermal anchoring and by filtering
both the low frequency and radio frequency noise. Ultimately, for high
performance filters the electron temperature can approach the phonon
temperature (as measured by resistive thermometers) in a dilution refrigerator.
In this application note, the method for measuring the electron temperature in
a typical quantum electronics device using Coulomb blockade thermometry is
described. This technique is applied to find the readily achievable electron
temperature in the device when using the QFilter provided by QDevil. With our
thermometry measurements, using a single GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot in an
optimized experimental setup, we determined an electron temperature of 28 $\pm$
2 mK for a dilution refrigerator base temperature of 18 mK.

<p>Noble gas atoms such as Kr and Xe are byproducts of nuclear fission in
nuclear plants. How to trap and confine these volatile even radioactive gases
is particularly challenging. Recent studies have shown that they can be trapped
in nanocages of ultrathin silica. Here, we exhibit with self-consistent phonon
theory and four-phonon (4ph) scattering where the adsorption of noble gases
results in an anomalous increase in lattice thermal conductivity, while the
presence of Cu atoms doping leads to a reduction in lattice thermal
conductivity. We trace this behavior in host-guest 2D silica to an interplay of
tensile strain, rattling phonon modes, and redistribution of electrons. We also
find that 4ph scatterings play indispensable roles in the lattice thermal
conductivity of 2D silica. Our work illustrates the microscopic heat transfer
mechanism in 2D silica nanocages with the immobilization of noble gas atoms and
inspires further exploring materials with the kagome and glasslike lattice
thermal conductivity.

</p><i>Shuai Wang, Li-Hua Shao</i>
<p>Dislocation is a very important one-dimensional defect in ferroelectrics.
This work introduces an easy and flexible model of implementing the edge
dislocation by introducing eigenstrain at the interface, and it could be easily
extended to incorporate the surface stress to refine the analysis of
ferroelectric thin films. The influence of dislocations on the ferroelectric
domain wall motion and hysteresis loop including the remanent polarization and
coercive field using phase-field simulations is analyzed. The pinning effect of
the dislocation on the domain wall motion is discussed and whether the domain
wall is pined is the competition between the external loading and the magnitude
of the burgers vector of the dislocation. This work could contribute to the
understanding of the pining effect of the dislocation and provide guidance for
the fabrication of ferroelectric thin films.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Bound for Canonical Nonlinearity Under Single-Shot Work</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Koretaka Yuge</i>
<p>For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically
substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body
interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic
equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational
geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the
nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which
is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold.
Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice
characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to
thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially,
thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to
nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We
derive the bound for the extended nonlinearity in nonequilibrium state,
characterized by the nonlinearity in equilibrium state, Renyi alpha-divergence
between equilibrium and nonequilibrium distribution, temperature and work.

<p>The molecular-based ferrimagnetic insulator V(TCNE)x has gained recent
interest for efficient spin-wave excitation due to its low Gilbert damping
ratio a=4E-5, and narrow ferromagnetic resonance linewidth f=1Oe. Here we
report a clean spin pumping signal detected on V(TCNE)x/metal bilayer
structures, free from spin rectification or thermal artifacts. On-chip coupling
of microwave power is achieved via a coplanar waveguide to measure the in-plane
angle-dependence of the inverse spin-Hall effect under ferromagnetic resonance
conditions with respect to a constant external magnetic field. A signature of
pure spin current from V(TCNE)x is observed in both platinum and permalloy
metal layers, demonstrating the utility of V(TCNE)x for magnon spintronics
studies in molecule/solid-state heterostructures.

<p>Fermionic superfluidity with a nontrivial Cooper-pairing, beyond the
conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state, is a captivating field of study
in quantum many-body systems. In particular, the search for superconducting
states with finite-momentum pairs has long been a challenge, but establishing
its existence has long suffered from the lack of an appropriate probe to reveal
its momentum. Recently, it has been proposed that the nonreciprocal {\cred
electron} transport is the most {\cred powerful} probe for the finite-momentum
pairs, {\cred because it directly couples} to the supercurrents. Here we reveal
such a pairing state by the non-reciprocal transport on tricolor superlattices
with strong spin-orbit coupling combined with broken inversion-symmetry
consisting of atomically thin $d$-wave superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We find that
while the second-harmonic resistance exhibits a distinct dip anomaly at the
low-temperature ($T$)/high-magnetic field ($H$) corner in the $HT$-plane for
${\bm H}$ applied to the antinodal direction of the $d$-wave gap, such an
anomaly is absent for ${\bm H}$ along the nodal direction. By meticulously
isolating extrinsic effects due to vortex dynamics, we reveal the presence of a
non-reciprocal response originating from intrinsic superconducting properties
characterized by finite-momentum pairs. We attribute the high-field state to
the helical superconducting state, wherein the phase of the order parameter is
spontaneously spatially modulated.

<p>Granular metals offer tailorable electronic properties and play crucial roles
in device and sensor applications. We have fabricated a series of nonmagnetic
granular CoSi2 thin films and studied the Hall effect and transport properties.
We observed a two orders of magnitude enhancement in the Hall coefficient in
films fall slightly above the metal-insulator transition. This giant Hall
effect (GHE) is ascribed to the local quantum-interference effect induced
reduction of the charge carriers. Transmission electron microscopy images and
transport properties indicate that our films form two dimensional granular
arrays. The GHE may provide useful and sensitive applications.

<p>The quantum states of an ellipsoidal nanocluster of a heterophase system InAs

is shown that the spectrum of a nanoobject is formed from local groups,
consisting of discrete levels, separated by terahertz frequency intervals. A
double random degeneration of certain spectrum states is revealed. Allowed
mid-infrared (IR) optical transitions between different spectral states are
analyzed. The role of dimensional parameters and features of the shape of a
nanoobject in the characteristics of unipolar transitions is assessed. The
absorption spectrum for the transition in the lower part of the substructure

<p>Single atomic defects are prominent windows to look into host quantum states
because collective responses from the host states emerge as localized states
around the defects. Friedel oscillations and Kondo clouds in Fermi liquids are
quintessential examples. However, the situation is quite different for quantum
spin liquid (QSL), an exotic state of matter with fractionalized quasiparticles
and topological order arising from a profound impact of quantum entanglement.
Elucidating the underlying local electronic property has been challenging due
to the charge neutrality of fractionalized quasiparticles and the insulating
nature of QSLs. Here, using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling
microscopy, we report atomically resolved images of monolayer
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, the most promising Kitaev QSL candidate, on metallic
substrates. We find quantum interference in the insulator manifesting as
incommensurate and decaying spatial oscillations of the local density of states
around defects with a characteristic bias dependence. The oscillation differs
from any known spatial structures in its nature and does not exist in other
Mott insulators, implying it is an exotic oscillation involved with excitations
unique to $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Numerical simulations can reproduce the observed
oscillation by assuming that itinerant Majorana fermions of Kitaev QSL are
scattered across the Majorana Fermi surface. The oscillation provides a new
approach to exploring Kitaev QSLs through the local response against defects
like Friedel oscillations in metals.

<h3>Intrinsic Dipole Hall effect in tMoTe$_2$ moiré: magnetoelectricity  and contact-free signature of topological transitions</h3>

</p><i>Feng-Ren Fan, Cong Xiao, Wang Yao</i>
<p>We discover an intrinsic dipole Hall effect in a variety of magnetic
insulating states at integer fillings of twisted MoTe$_2$ moir\'e superlattice,
including topologically trivial and nontrivial ferro-, antiferro-, and
ferri-magnetic configurations. The dipole Hall current, in linear response to
in-plane electric field, generates an in-plane orbital magnetization
$M_{\parallel}$ along the field, through which an AC field can drive
magnetization oscillation up to THz range. Upon the continuous topological
phase transitions from trivial to quantum anomalous Hall states in both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, the dipole Hall current and
$M_{\parallel}$ have an abrupt sign change, enabling contact free detection of
the transitions through the magnetic stray field. In configurations where the
linear response is forbidden by symmetry, the dipole Hall current and
$M_{\parallel}$ appear as a crossed nonlinear response to both in-plane and
out-of-plane electric fields. These magnetoelectric phenomena showcase novel
functionalities of insulators from the interplay between magnetism, topology
and electrical polarization.

<p>We analyze the universal conformational properties of complex copolymer
macromolecules, based on two topologies: the rosette structure containing $f_c$
linear branches and $f_r$ closed loops grafted to the central core, and the
symmetric pom-pom structure, consisting of a backbone linear chain terminated
by two branching points with functionalities $f$. We assume that the
constituent strands (branches) of these structures can be of two different
chemical species $a$ and $b$. Depending on the solvent conditions, the inter-
or intrachain interactions of some links may vanish, which corresponds to
$\Theta$-state of the corresponding polymer species. Applying both the
analytical approach within the frames of direct polymer renormalization and
numerical simulations based on the lattice model of polymer, we evaluated the
set of parameters characterizing the size properties of constituent parts of
two complex topologies and estimated quantitatively the impact of interactions
between constituent parts on these size characteristics.

<br>
</p><i>S. M. Tschopp, J. M. Brader</i>
<p>The superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT)
is a promising new method for the study of colloidal systems
out-of-equilibrium. Within this approach the viscous forces arising from
interparticle interactions are accounted for in a natural way by treating
explicitly the dynamics of the two-body correlations. For bulk systems subject
to spatially homogeneous shear we use the superadiabatic-DDFT framework to
calculate the steady-state pair distribution function and the corresponding
viscosity for low values of the shear-rate. We then consider a variant of the
central approximation underlying this superadiabatic theory and obtain an
inhomogeneous generalization of a rheological bulk theory due to Russel and
Gast. This paper thus establishes for the first time a connection between DDFT
approaches, formulated to treat inhomogeneous systems, and existing work
addressing nonequilibrium microstructure and rheology in bulk colloidal
suspensions.

<p>The surface tension of monolayers with mixtures of anionic and nonionic
surfactant at the liquid/vapour interface is studied. Previous works have
observed that calculations of the surface tension of simple fluids show
artificial oscillations for small interfacial areas, indicating that the
surface tension data fluctuate due to the finite size effects and periodic
boundary conditions. In the case of simulations of monolayers composed of
surfactant mixtures, the surface tension not only oscillates for small areas
but can also give non-physical data, such as negative values. Analysis of the
monolayers with different surfactant mixtures, ionic (DTAB, CTAB, SDS) and
nonionic (SB3-12), was done for density profiles, parameters of order and pair
correlation functions for small and large box areas and all of them present
similar behaviour. The fluctuations and the non-physical values of the surface
tension are corrected when boxes with large interfacial areas are considered.
The results indicate that in order to obtain reliable values of the surface
tension, in computer simulations, it is important to choose not only the
correct force field but also the appropriate size of the simulation box.

<p>The molecular self-assembly and the magnetic properties of two
cyclooctatetraenide (COT) - based single-ion magnets (SIM) adsorbed on Ag(100)
in the sub-monolayer range are reported. Our study combines scanning-tunneling
microscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and polarized X-ray absorption
spectroscopy to show that Cp*ErCOT (Cp* =
1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienide anion) SIMs self-assemble as alternating
compact parallel rows including standing-up and lying-down conformations,
following the main crystallographic directions of the substrate. Conversely,
K[Er(COT)$_2$], obtained from subliming the [K(18-c-6)][Er(COT)$_2$]$\cdot$
2THF salt, forms uniaxially ordered domains with the (COT)$^{2-}$ rings
perpendicular to the substrate plane. The polarization-dependent X-ray
absorption spectra reproduced by the multiX simulations suggest that the strong
in-plane magnetic anisotropy of K[Er(COT)$_2$]/Ag(100) and the weak
out-of-plane anisotropy of Cp*ErCOT/Ag(100) can be attributed to the strikingly
different surface ordering of these two complexes. Compared to the bulk phase,
surface-supported K[Er(COT)$_2$] exhibits a similarly large hysteresis opening,
while the Cp*ErCOT shows a rather small opening. This result reveals that
despite structural similarities, the two organometallic SMMs have strongly
different magnetic properties when adsorbed on the metal substrate, attributed
to the different orientations and the resulting interactions of the ligand
rings with the surface.

<p>An integral relation is derived from the Fokker-Planck equation which
connects the steady-state probability currents with the dynamics of relaxation
on short timescales in the limit of small perturbation fields. As a consequence
of this integral relation, a lower bound on the steady-state entropy production
is obtained. For the particular case of an ensemble of random perturbation

relation which provides a feasible method to estimate entropy production from

<p>Phase separation plays an role in determining the self-assembly of biological
and soft-matter systems. In biological systems, liquid-liquid phase separation
inside a cell leads to the formation of various macromolecular aggregates. The
interaction among these aggregates is soft, i.e., these can significantly
overlap at a small energy cost. From the computer simulation point of view,
these complex macromolecular aggregates are generally modeled by the so-called
soft particles. The effective interaction between two particles is defined via
the generalized exponential potential (GEM-n) with n = 4. Here, using molecular
dynamics simulations, we study the phase separation dynamics of a
size-symmetric binary mixture of ultrasoft particles. We find that when the
mixture is quenched to a lower temperature below the critical temperature, the
two components spontaneously start to separate. Domains of the two components
form, and the equal-time order parameter reveals that the domains grow in a
power-law manner with exponent 1/3, which is consistent with the
Lifshitz-Slyozov law for conserved systems. Further, the static structure
factor shows a power-law decay with exponent 4 consistent with the Porod law.

<p>Antiferromagnetic (AF) order of U$_{2}$Pt$_{6}$Ga$_{15}$ with the ordering
temperature $T_{\rm N}$ = 26 K was investigated by resonant X-ray scattering
and neutron diffraction on single crystals. This compound possesses a unique
crystal structure in which uranium ions form honeycomb layers and then stacks
along the $c$-axis with slight offset, which gives rise to a stacking disorder.
The AF order can be described with the propagation vector of $q = (1/6, 1/6,
0)$ in the hexagonal notation. The ordered magnetic moments orient
perpendicular to the honeycomb layers, indicating a collinear spin structure
consistent with Ising-like anisotropy. The magnetic reflections are found to be
broadened along $c^*$ indicating that the stacking disorder results in
anisotropic correlation lengths. The semi-quantitative analysis of neutron
diffraction intensity, combined with group theory considerations based on the
crystallographic symmetry, suggests a zig-zag type magnetic structure for the
AF ground state, in which the AF coupling runs perpendicular to the stacking
offset, characterized as $q = (1, 0, 0)_{\rm orth}$. The realization of the
zig-zag magnetic structure implies the presence of frustrating intralayer
exchange interactions involving both ferromagnetic (FM) first-neighbor and AF
second and third-neighbor interactions in this compound.

<p>Flexible spintronics has opened new avenue to promising devices and
applications in the field of wearable electronics. Particularly, miniaturized
strain sensors exploiting the spintronic function have attracted considerable
attention, in which the magnetoelasticity linking magnetism and lattice
distortion is a vital property for high-sensitive detection of strain. This
paper reports the demonstration that the magnetoelastic properties of Fe$_4$N
can be significantly varied by partially replacing Fe with Co or Mn. The high
quality Fe$_4$N film exhibits large negative magnetostriction along the [100]
direction ($\lambda_{100}$) of -121 ppm while Fe$_{3.2}$Co$_{0.8}$N shows
$\lambda_{100}$ of +46 ppm. This wide-range tunability of $\lambda_{100}$ from
-121 to +46 across 0 allows us to thoroughly examine the correlation between
the magnetoelasticity and other magnetic properties. The strong correlation
between $\lambda_{100}$ and magnetic damping ($\alpha$) is found. The enhanced
extrinsic term of $\alpha$ is attributable to the large two magnon scattering
coming from the large magnetostriction. In addition, the density of states at
the Fermi level plays a primal role to determine both $\lambda_{100}$ and the
intrinsic term of $\alpha$. Thanks to the giant tunability and the bipolarity
of magnetoelasticity, magnetic nitrides are candidate materials for
high-sensitive spintronic strain sensors.

<h3>Electrically tunable, rapid spin-orbit torque induced modulation of  colossal magnetoresistance in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes</h3>

<p>As a quasi-layered ferrimagnetic material, Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes
exhibit magnetoresistance behaviour that is fundamentally different from their
bulk crystal counterparts. They offer three key properties crucial for
spintronics. Firstly, at least 10^6 times faster response comparing to that
exhibited by bulk crystals has been observed in current-controlled resistance
and magnetoresistance. Secondly, ultra-low current density is required for
resistance modulation (~ 5 A/cm$^2$). Thirdly, electrically gate-tunable
magnetoresistance has been realized. Theoretical calculations reveal that the
unique magnetoresistance behaviour in the Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes arises
from a magnetic field induced band gap shift across the Fermi level. The rapid
current induced resistance variation is attributed to spin-orbit torque, an
intrinsically ultra-fast process (~nanoseconds). This study suggests promising
avenues for spintronic applications. In addition, it highlights
Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes as a suitable platform for investigating the
intriguing physics underlying chiral orbital moments, magnetic field induced
band variation and spin torque.

<h3>Infinite Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operator Method in the  Steady State</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen</i>
<p>We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method
for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The
method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms
with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it
obtains numerically exact real-time Green's functions without sampling noises,
it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its
computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale
with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature
equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact
solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO
calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state
of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent
particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying
steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient
real-time impurity solver in quantum embedding methods such as the dynamical
mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.

<h3>Layer Control of Magneto-Optical Effects and Their Quantization in  Spin-Valley Splitting Antiferromagnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16701" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16701</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiaqi Feng, Xiaodong Zhou, Meiling Xu, Jingming Shi, Yinwei Li</i>
<p>Magneto-optical effects (MOE), interfacing the fundamental interplay between
magnetism and light, have served as a powerful probe for magnetic order, band
topology, and valley index. Here, based on multiferroic and topological bilayer
antiferromagnets (AFMs), we propose a layer control of MOE (L-MOE), which is
created and annihilated by layer-stacking or an electric field effect. The key
character of L-MOE is the sign-reversible response controlled by ferroelectric
polarization, the Neel vector, or the electric field direction. Moreover, the
sign-reversible L-MOE can be quantized in topologically insulating AFMs. We
reveal that the switchable L-MOE originates from the combined contributions of
spin-conserving and spin-flip interband transitions in spin-valley splitting
AFMs, a phenomenon not observed in conventional AFMs. Our findings bridge the
ancient MOE to the emergent realms of layertronics, valleytronics, and
multiferroics and may hold immense potential in these fields.

<h3>Phase Transformation in Lithium Niobate-Lithium Tantalate Solid  Solutions (LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$)</h3>

<p>The investigation of the structural phase transition in the vicinity of the
Curie temperature $T_c$ of LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$ crystals is motivated by the
expected combination of advantageous high-temperature properties of LiNbO$_3$
and LiTaO$_3$, including high piezoelectric modules and remarkable
high-temperature stability, respectively. $T_c$ marks the ultimate limit for
exploiting the piezoelectric properties, however transition related structural
modifications might impact this and other properties even below $T_c$.
Remarkably, the phase transition from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric
phase, whose temperature strongly depends on the composition $x$, shows a
significant drop in the activation energy of the electrical conductivity. The
magnitude, temperature dependence and underlying mechanisms of this drop are
discussed from a microscopic perspective. Molecular dynamics calculations in
the framework of the density functional theory show that substantial
displacements of the cations occur below $T_c$ for both the end compounds
LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$, and might thus affect the electrical conductivity.
Above $T_c$, the migration of lithium ions is presumably facilitated by a
shortened diffusion path for the most favorable jump of the lithium ions.
Electronic contributions to the conductivity, which become important above 900
K, are explained within the polaronic picture by the formation and migration of
free small polarons.

<p>Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected local magnetic solitons that
are promising for storage, logic or general computing applications. In this
work, we demonstrate that we can use a skyrmion device based on [W/CoFeB/MgO] 1
0 multilayers for three-dimensional magnetic field sensing enabled by
spin-orbit torques (SOT). We stabilize isolated chiral skyrmions and stripe
domains in the multilayers, as shown by magnetic force microscopy images and
micromagnetic simulations. We perform magnetic transport measurements to show
that we can sense both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields by means of a
differential measurement scheme in which the symmetry of the SOT leads to
cancelation of the DC offset. With the magnetic parameters obtained by
vibrating sample magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance measurements, we
perform finite-temperature micromagnetic simulations, where we investigate the
fundamental origin of the sensing signal. We identify the topological
transformation between skyrmions, stripes and type-II bubbles that leads to a
change in the resistance that is read-out by the anomalous Hall effect. Our
study presents a novel application for skyrmions, where a differential
measurement sensing concept is applied to quantify external magnetic fields
paving the way towards more energy efficient applications in skyrmionics based
spintronics.

<p>We investigate the properties of mobility edge in an Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper
model with non-reciprocal long-range hopping. The results reveal that there can
be a new type of mobility edge featuring both strength-dependent and scale-free
properties. By calculating the fractal dimension, we find that the positions of
mobility edges are robust to the strength of non-reciprocal long-range hopping.
Furthermore, through scale analysis of the observables such as fractal
dimension, eigenenergy and eigenstate, etc., we prove that four different
specific mobility edges can be observed in the system. This paper extends the
family tree of mobility edges and hopefully it will shed more light on the
related theory and experiment.

<p>This research focuses on the unique phase behavior of non-spherical patchy
colloids in porous environments. Based on the theory of scaled particle (SPT),
methods have been refined and applied to analyze the thermodynamic properties
of non-spherical patchy particles in a disordered porous medium. Utilizing the
associative theory of liquids in conjunction with SPT, we investigated the
impact of associative interactions and connections between the functional nodes
of particles on the formation of the nematic phase. Calculations of
orientational and spatial distributions were conducted, which helped to
understand the phase behavior of particles during the transition from isotropic
to nematic phase under the spatial constraints imposed by the disordered matrix
of the porous medium.

</p><i>Winston Lindqwister, Manolis Veveakis, Martin Lesueur</i>
<p>Porous media, while ubiquitous across many engineering disciplines, is
inherently difficult to characterize due to their innate stochasticity and
heterogeneity. The key for predicting porous material behavior comes down to
the structuring of its microstructure, where the linkages of microstructural
properties to mesoscale effects remain as one of the key questions in unlocking
understanding of this class of materials. One proposed method of linking scales
comes down to using Minkowski functionals -- geometric morphometers that
describe the spatial and topological features of a convex space -- to draw
connections from microstructural form to mesoscale features. In this work,
chemical equilibrium and kinetics on a microstructure surface were explored,
with Minkowski functionals used as the basis for relating microstructural
geometry to chemical performance. Using surface CRNs to model chemical behavior
-- a novel asynchronous cellular automaton -- linkages were found between the
Minkowski functionals and equilibrium equilibrium constant, as well as
properties related to the dynamics of the system's reaction quotient.

<p>Gate-tunable transmons (gatemons) employing semiconductor Josephson junctions
have recently emerged as building blocks for hybrid quantum circuits. In this
study, we present a gatemon fabricated in planar Germanium. We induce
superconductivity in a two-dimensional hole gas by evaporating aluminum atop a
thin spacer, which separates the superconductor from the Ge quantum well. The
Josephson junction is then integrated into an Xmon circuit and capacitively
coupled to a transmission line resonator. We showcase the qubit tunability in a
broad frequency range with resonator and two-tone spectroscopy. Time-domain
characterizations reveal energy relaxation and coherence times up to 75 ns. Our
results, combined with the recent advances in the spin qubit field, pave the
way towards novel hybrid and protected qubits in a group IV, CMOS-compatible

<h3>Nonlinear spontaneous flow instability in active nematics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ido Lavi, Ricard Alert, Jean-François Joanny, Jaume Casademunt</i>
<p>Active nematics exhibit spontaneous flows through a well-known linear
instability of the uniformly-aligned quiescent state. Here we show that even a
linearly stable uniform state can experience a nonlinear instability, resulting
in a discontinuous transition to spontaneous flows. In this case, quiescent and
flowing states may coexist. Through a weakly nonlinear analysis and a numerical
study, we trace the bifurcation diagram of striped patterns and show that the
underlying pitchfork bifurcation switches from supercritical (continuous) to
subcritical (discontinuous) by varying the flow-alignment parameter. We predict
that the discontinuous spontaneous flow transition occurs for a wide range of
parameters, including systems of contractile flow-aligning rods. Our
predictions are relevant to active nematic turbulence and can potentially be
tested in experiments on either cell layers or active cytoskeletal suspensions.

<p>We study electron localization in disordered quantum systems, focusing on

as a numerical indicator to characterize the system's localization length.
Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of mean-field approximation in providing a
quantitative analysis of such systems. Through this study, we seek to provide
insight into the following aspects: the behavior of electron localization as a
function of interaction, disorder, and temperature, whether thermal states and
highly excited states exhibit similar properties in many-body localized
systems, and the reliability of the mean-field approximation in low-interaction
scenarios.

<p>Motion in bounded domains represents a paradigm in several settings: from
billiard dynamics, to random walks in a finite lattice, with applications to
relevant physical, ecological and biological problems. A remarkable universal
property, involving the average of return times to the boundary, has been
theoretically proposed, and experimentally verified in quite different
contexts. We discuss here mechanisms that lead to violations of universality,
induced by boundary effects. We suggest that our analysis should be relevant
where non homogeneity appears in the stationary probability distribution in
bounded domain.

<h3>Spin-charge separation in the quantum boomerang effect</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Pablo Capuzzi, Luca Tessieri, Zehra Akdeniz, Anna Minguzzi, Patrizia Vignolo</i>
<p>We study the localization dynamics of a SU(2) fermionic wavepacket launched
in a (pseudo)random potential. We show that in the limit of strong
inter-component repulsions, the total wavepacket exhibits a boomerang-like
dynamics, returning near its initial position as expected for non-interacting
particles, while separately each spin-component does not. This spin-charge
separation effect occurs both in the infinite repulsive limit and at finite
interactions. At infinite interactions, the system is integrable and
thermalization cannot occur: the two spin-components push each other during the
dynamics and their centers of mass stop further from each other than their
initial position. At finite interactions, integrability is broken, the two
spin-components oscillate and mix, with their center-of-mass positions
converging very slowly to the center of mass of the whole system. This is a
signature that the final localized state is a fully spin-mixed thermalized
state.

</p><i>Luyan Yang, Andrii S. Savchenko, Fengshan Zheng, Nikolai S. Kiselev, Filipp N. Rybakov, Xiaodong Han, Stefan Blügel, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski</i>
<p>Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that
possess particle-like properties. Earlier research was mainly focused on a
specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = -1. However, theoretical
analyses of two-dimensional chiral magnets have predicted the existence of
skyrmion bags -- solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological
charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental
observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a
limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy, we show the extraordinary stability of
skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20-type FeGe. In particular, we show that
skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or
inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such
embedded skyrmion bags is provided. Our results agree perfectly with
micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as
a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic
solitons.

<p>Raman spectroscopy together with density functional calculations were used to
study lattice dynamics in a layered honeycomb cobaltite Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$,
which can host a field-induced phase related with the Kitaev physics. We show
that there develops an additional mode well above Neel temperature (at $\approx
200$K) at 525 cm$^{-1}$, which origin can be related to an electronic
excitation to one of $j_{3/2}$ doublets. Moreover, our theoretical calculations
demonstrate that the highest frequency intensive mode related to the oxygen
vibrations is very sensitive to type of the magnetic order. Thus, we propose to
use the softening of this mode as a hallmark of the transition to a fully
polarized regime, which is stabilized in Kitaev materials in strong magnetic
fields.

<br>
</p><i>William D. Piñeros, Étienne Fodor</i>
<p>We discover unexpected connections between packing configurations and rare
fluctuations in dense systems of active particles subject to pulsation of size.
Using large deviation theory, we examine biased ensembles which select atypical
realizations of the dynamics exhibiting high synchronization in particle size.
We show that the order emerging at high bias can manifest as distinct dynamical
states with either a finite or a vanishing size current. Remarkably,
transitions between these states arise from changing the system geometry at
fixed bias and constant density. We rationalize such transitions as stemming
from a change in the packing configurations favored by the geometry.
Specifically, we reveal that a master curve in the unbiased dynamics,
correlating polydispersity and current, helps predict the dynamical state
emerging in the biased dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that deformation waves
can propagate under suitable geometries when biasing with local order.

<p>We report an experimental study of the magnetic properties of infinite-layer
Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at Ni L3,2
and Nd M5,4 edges. We show that at low temperatures the out-of-plane component
of the Ni1+ spin-moment is characterized by a rapid increase for magnetic
fields below 1T , followed by a slower linear increase reaching a spin-moment
value of 0.25uB/Ni at 9T in the case of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2. On the
other hand, the Nd M5,4 XMCD shows a clear paramagnetic behaviour, which make
both Ni- and Nd-spin-sublattices fully uncorrelated.The magnetic field and
temperature dependencies of the Ni L3,2 XMCD data can be explained by assuming
an out-of-plane canting of the strongly in-plane anti-ferromagnetic ordered
Ni1+ spins. A symmetry lowering of the NiO2 planes observed via
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, triggering a DMI,
can be responsible of the proposed Ni1+ spin-canting at zero-field. The
resulting out-of-plane weak-ferromagnetic coupling under magnetic field
explains the relatively large spin-moment and its magnetic field and
temperature dependence.

<p>We study the effect of the fragility of glass formers on the yielding
transition under oscillatory shear via extensive computer simulations.
Employing sphere assemblies interacting with a harmonic potential as our model
glass former, we tune fragility by changing the system's density - higher
density corresponds to large fragility. Our study reveals significant
differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass
formers. While both glass formers exhibit similar behaviour under poorly
annealed initial conditions, the yielding transition shifts to larger values
with increased annealing for fragile glasses while remaining relatively
constant for strong glasses. We rationalize our results by introducing a new
elastoplastic model, which qualitatively reproduces the simulation results and
offers valuable insight into the physics of yielding transition under
oscillatory shear deformation.

<p>We propose a tensor network approach known as the locally purified density
operator (LPDO) to investigate the classification and characterization of
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. We extend
the concept of injectivity, originally associated with matrix product states
and projected entangled pair states, to LPDOs in $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems,
unveiling two distinct types of injectivity conditions inherent in short-range
entangled density matrices. Within the LPDO framework, we outline a
classification scheme for decohered average symmetry-protected topological
(ASPT) phases, consistent with earlier results obtained through spectrum
sequence techniques. We illustrate our framework with examples of ASPTs
protected by fermion parity symmetry in both $(1+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ systems. In
addition, we discuss the classification of ASPT phases for a general group
extension. We demonstrate examples of explicit construction of fixed-point
LPDOs for ASPT phases including intrinsic ASPTs in $(1+1)D$ systems.

<p>Stimulus-induced volumetric phase transition in gels may be potentially
exploited for various bio-engineering and mechanical engineering applications.
Since the discovery of the phenomenon in the 1970s, extensive experimental
research has helped in understanding the phase transition and related critical
phenomena. Yet, little insight is available on the evolving microstructure. In
this article, we aim at unravelling certain geometric aspects of the
micromechanics underlying discontinuous phase transition in polyacrylamide
gels. Towards this, we use geometric thermodynamics and a Landau-Ginzburg type
free energy functional involving a squared gradient, in conjunction with
Flory-Huggins theory. We specifically exploit Ruppeiner's approach of
Riemannian geometry-enriched thermodynamic fluctuation theory that has been
previously employed to investigate phase transitions in van der Waals fluids
and black holes. The framework equips us with a scalar curvature that relates
to the microstructural interactions of a gel during phase transition and at
critical points. This curvature also provides an insight into the universality
class of phase transition and the nature of polymer-polymer interactions.
