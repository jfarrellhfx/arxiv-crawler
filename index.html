<h3>Incorporating Shear into Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Methods for  Rheological Studies of Complex Fluids and Soft Materials</h3>

We develop computational methods that incorporate shear into fluctuating
hydrodynamics methods. We are motivated by the rheological responses of complex
fluids and soft materials. Our approach is based on continuum stochastic
hydrodynamic equations that are subject to shear boundary conditions on the
unit periodic cell in a manner similar to the Lees-Edwards conditions of
molecular dynamics. Our methods take into account consistently the
microstructure elastic mechanics, fluid-structure hydrodynamic coupling, and
thermal fluctuations. For practical simulations, we develop numerical methods
for efficient stochastic field generation that handle the sheared generalized
periodic boundary conditions. We show that our numerical methods are consistent
with fluctuation dissipation balance and near-equilibrium statistical
mechanics. As a demonstration in practice, we present several prototype
rheological response studies. These include (i) shear thinning of a polymeric
fluid, (ii) complex moduli for the oscillatory responses of a polymerized lipid
vesicle, and (iii) aging under shear of a gel-like material.

<h3>Shape-tension coupling produces nematic order in an epithelium vertex  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11037" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11037</a>

<br>
<br>
We study the vertex model for epithelial tissue mechanics extended to include
coupling between the cell shapes and tensions in cell-cell junctions. This
coupling represents an active force which drives the system out of equilibrium
and leads to the formation of nematic order interspersed with prominent,
long-lived $+1$ defects. The defects in the nematic ordering are coupled to the
shape of the cell tiling, affecting cell areas and coordinations. This
intricate interplay between cell shape, size, and coordination provides a
possible mechanism by which tissues could spontaneously develop long-range
polarity through local mechanical forces without resorting to long-range
chemical patterning.

<h3>Depth-resolved measurements of the Meissner screening profile in  surface-treated Nb</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11081</a>

<br>
<br>
We report depth-resolved measurements of the Meissner screening profile in
several surface-treated Nb samples using low-energy muon spin rotation
(LE-$\mu$SR). In these experiments, implanted positive muons, whose stopping
depths below Nb's surface were adjusted between ~10 nm to ~150 nm, reveal the
field distribution inside the superconducting element via their spin-precession
(communicated through their radioactive decay products). We compare how the
field screening is modified by different surface treatments commonly employed
to prepare superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities used in accelerator
beamlines. In contrast to an earlier report [A. Romanenko et al., Appl. Phys.
Lett. 104 072601 (2014)], we find no evidence for any "anomalous" modifications
to the Meissner profiles, with all data being well-described by a London model.
Differences in screening properties between surface treatments can be explained
by changes to the carrier mean-free-paths resulting from dopant profiles near
the material's surface.

<h3>Bose polaron interactions in a cavity-coupled monolayer semiconductor</h3>

The interaction between a mobile quantum impurity and a bosonic bath leads to
the formation of quasiparticles, termed Bose polarons. The elementary
properties of Bose polarons, such as their mutual interactions, can differ
drastically from those of the bare impurities. Here, we explore Bose polaron
physics in a two-dimensional nonequilibrium setting by injecting $\sigma^-$
polarised exciton-polariton impurities into a bath of coherent $\sigma^+$
polarised polaritons generated by resonant laser excitation of monolayer
MoSe$_2$ embedded in an optical cavity. By exploiting a biexciton Feshbach
resonance between the impurity and the bath polaritons, we tune the interacting
system to the strong-coupling regime and demonstrate the coexistence of two new
quasiparticle branches. Using time-resolved pump-probe measurements we observe
how polaron dressing modifies the interaction between impurity polaritons.
Remarkably, we find that the interactions between high-energy polaron
quasiparticles, that are repulsive for small bath occupancy, can become
attractive in the strong impurity-bath coupling regime. Our experiments provide
the first direct measurement of Bose polaron-polaron interaction strength in
any physical system and pave the way for exploration and control of many-body
correlations in driven-dissipative settings.

<h3>Coherent backscattering in the topological Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10588" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10588</a>
<br>

<br>
The mutual interplay between electron transport and magnetism has attracted
considerable attention in recent years, primarily motivated by strategies to
manipulate magnetic degrees of freedom electrically, such as spin-orbit torques
and domain wall motion. Within this field the topological Hall effect, which
originates from scalar spin chirality, is an example of inter-band quantum
coherence induced by real-space inhomogeneous magnetic textures, and its
magnitude depends on the winding number and chiral spin features that establish
the total topological charge of the system. Remarkably, in the two decades
since its discovery, there has been no research on the quantum correction to
the topological Hall effect. Here we will show that, unlike the ordinary Hall
effect, the inhomogeneous magnetization arising from the spin texture will give
additional scattering terms in the kinetic equation, which result in a quantum
correction to the topological Hall resistivity. We focus on 2D systems, where
weak localization is strongest, and determine the complicated gradient
corrections to the Cooperon and kinetic equation. Whereas the weak localization
correction to the topological Hall effect is not large in currently known
materials, we show that it is experimentally observable in dilute magnetic
semiconductors. Our theoretical results will stimulate experiments on the
topological Hall effect and fill the theoretical knowledge gap on weak
localization corrections to transverse transport.

<h3>Non-equilibrium thermodynamics in a single-molecule quantum system</h3>

Thermodynamic probes can be used to deduce microscopic internal dynamics of
nanoscale quantum systems. Several direct entropy measurement protocols based
on charge transport measurements have been proposed and experimentally applied
to single-electron devices. To date, these methods have relied on
(quasi-)equilibrium conditions between the nanoscale quantum system and its
environment, which constitutes only a small subset of the experimental
conditions available. In this paper, we establish a thermodynamic analysis
method based on stochastic thermodynamics, that is valid far from equilibrium
conditions, is applicable to a broad range of single-electron devices and
allows us to find the difference in entropy between the charge states of the
nanodevice, as well as a characteristic of any selection rules governing
electron transfers. We apply this non-equilibrium entropy measurement protocol
to a single-molecule device in which the internal dynamics can be described by
a two-site Hubbard model.

<h3>Interfacial doping in LaVO$_3$/SrVO$_3$ multilayers from DFT+DMFT</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10601" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10601</a>
<br>
<i>Sophie Beck, Claude Ederer</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of spatial doping of the Mott insulator LaVO$_3$ by
inserting a few layers of the correlated metal SrVO$_3$ in multilayer
geometries. Using density functional theory in combination with dynamical
mean-field theory, we demonstrate that this leads to a geometrically confined
and robust metallic layer that stabilizes the metallicity in SrVO$_3$ even in
the ultrathin layer limit, suppressing a potential dimensionality-induced
metal-insulator transition. For a thicker SrVO$_3$ layer, we find a continuous
transition of both structural and electronic properties across the interface
between the two materials, with bulk properties reestablished on a length scale
of 2-3 unit cells away from the interface. We show that a strain modulation
applied along the growth direction can lead to asymmetric charge reconstruction
at chemically symmetric interfaces. However, we find that this effect is rather
weak, implying that fractional occupancy, and thus metallicity, persists at the
interfaces.

<h3>Landau-Ginzburg theory of charge density wave formation accompanying  lattice and electronic long-range ordering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10604" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10604</a>
<br>
<i>Anna Morozovska, Eugene Eliseev, Venkatraman Gopalan, Long-Qing Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an analytical Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theory of the charge density
waves (CDW) coupled with lattice and electronic long-range order parameters.
Examples of long-range order include electronic wave function of
superconducting Cooper pairs, structural distortions, electric polarization,
and magnetization. We formulate the LG free energy density as power expansion
with respect to the charge density and other long-range order parameters, as
well as their spatial gradients, and biquadratic coupling terms. We introduced
a biquadratic coupling between the charge density gradient and long-range order
parameters, as well as nonlinear higher gradients of the long-range order
parameters. The biquadratic gradient coupling is critical to the appearance of
different spatially-modulated phases in charge-ordered ferroics and
high-temperature superconductors. We derived the thermodynamic conditions for
the stability of the spatially-modulated phases, which are the intertwined
spatial waves of charge density and lattice/electronic long-range order. The
analytical expressions for the energies of different phases, corresponding
order parameters, CDW amplitudes and modulation periods, obtained in this work,
can be employed to guide the comprehensive physical explanation, deconvolution
and Bayesian analysis of experimental data on quantum materials ranging from
charge-ordered ferroics to high-temperature superconductors.

<h3>Kinematics and dynamics of disclination lines in three-dimensional  nematics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10620" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10620</a>
<br>
<i>Cody D. Schimming, Jorge Viñals</i>
<br>
<br>
An exact kinematic law for the motion of disclination lines in nematic liquid
crystals as a function of the tensor order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$ is derived.
Unlike other order parameter fields that become singular at their respective
defect cores, the tensor order parameter remains regular. Following earlier
experimental and theoretical work, the disclination core is defined to be the
line where the uniaxial and biaxial order parameters are equal, or
equivalently, where the two largest eigenvalues of $\mathbf{Q}$ cross. This
allows an exact expression relating the velocity of the line to spatial and
temporal derivatives of $\mathbf{Q}$ on the line, to be specified by a
dynamical model for the evolution of the nematic. By introducing a linear core
approximation for $\mathbf{Q}$, analytical results are given for several
prototypical configurations, including line interactions and motion, loop
annihilation, and the response to external fields and shear flows. Behaviour
that follows from topological constraints or defect geometry is highlighted.
The analytic results are shown to be in agreement with three dimensional
numerical calculations based on a singular Maier-Saupe free energy that allows
for anisotropic elasticity.

<h3>Localization challenges quantum chaos in finite two-dimensional Anderson  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10625" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10625</a>
<br>
<i>Jan Šuntajs, Tomaž Prosen, Lev Vidmar</i>
<br>
<br>
It is believed that the two-dimensional (2D) Anderson model exhibits
localization for any nonzero disorder in the thermodynamic limit and it is also
well known that the finite-size effects are considerable in the weak disorder
limit. Here we numerically study the quantum-chaos to localization transition
in finite 2D Anderson models using standard indicators used in the modern
literature such as the level spacing ratio, spectral form factor, variances of
observable matrix elements, participation entropy and the eigenstate
entanglement entropy. We show that many features of these indicators may
indicate emergence of robust single-particle quantum chaos at weak disorder.
However, we argue that a careful numerical analysis is consistent with the
single-parameter scaling theory and predicts the breakdown of quantum chaos at
any nonzero disorder value in the thermodynamic limit. Among the hallmarks of
this breakdown are the universal behavior of the spectral form factor at weak
disorder, and the universal scaling of various indicators as a function of the
parameter $u = \left(W \ln V\right)^{-1}$ where $W$ is the disorder strength
and $V$ is the number of lattice sites.

<h3>Anharmonic lattice dynamics via the special displacement method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10633</a>
<br>
<i>Marios Zacharias, George Volonakis, Feliciano Giustino, Jacky Even</i>
<br>
<br>
On the basis of the self-consistent phonon theory and the special
displacement method, we develop a new approach for the treatment of
anharmonicity in solids. We show that this approach enables the efficient
calculation of temperature-dependent anharmonic phonon dispersions, requiring
very few steps to achieve self-consistency for the system's free energy. We
demonstrate this methodology in the regime of strongly anharmonic materials
which exhibit a multi-well potential energy surface, like cubic SrTiO$_3$,
CsPbBr$_3$, CsPbI$_3$, CsSnI$_3$, and Zr. Our results are in good agreement
with experiments and previous first-principles studies relying on perturbative,
stochastic nonperturbative, and molecular dynamics simulations. We achieve a
very robust workflow by using harmonic phonons of the polymorphous ground state
as the starting point and an iterative mixing scheme of the dynamical matrix.
Given the simplicity, efficiency, and stability of the present treatment to
anharmonicity, it is especially suitable for use with any electronic structure
code and for investigating electron-phonon couplings in strongly anharmonic
systems.

<h3>Ultrafast Entanglement Dynamics in Monitored Quantum Circuits</h3>

<br>

Projective measurement, a basic operation in quantum mechanics, can induce
seemingly nonlocal effects. In this work, we analyze such effects in many-body
systems by studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of weakly monitored quantum
circuits, focusing on entanglement generation and information spreading. We
find that, due to measurements, the entanglement dynamics in monitored circuits
is indeed "faster" than that of unitary ones in several ways. Specifically, we
find that a pair of well-separated regions can become entangled in a time scale
$\ell^{2/3}$, sub-linear in their distance $\ell$. For the case of Clifford
monitored circuits, this originates from super-ballistically growing stabilizer
generators of the evolving state. In addition, we find initially local
information can spread super-ballistically as $t^{3/2}$. Furthermore, by
viewing the dynamics as a dynamical encoding process, we show that the
super-ballistic growing length scale relates to an encoding time that is
sublinear in system size. To quantify the information dynamics, we develop a
formalism generalizing operator spreading to non-unitary dynamics, which is of
independent interest.

<h3>Tunable topological phases in monolayer Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ with exchange  fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10667" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10667</a>
<br>
<i>Vassilios Vargiamidis, P. Vasilopoulos, Neophytos Neophytou</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate topological phases of monolayer jacutingaite (Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$)
that arise when considering the competing effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
magnetic exchange interactions, and staggered sublattice potential V. The
interplay between the staggered potential and exchange field offers the
possibility of attaining different topological phases. By analyzing the Berry
curvatures and computing the Chern numbers and Hall conductivities, we
demonstrate that the system is time-reversal-symmetry-broken quantum spin Hall
insulator when $m_b<\lambda_{so}$, where $m_b$ is the exchange field operating
on the bottom Hg sublattice and $\lambda_{so}$ is the intrinsic SOC. For $m_b >
\lambda_{so}$ and in the presence of Rashba SOC, we find that the band gap at
valley $K(K^{\prime})$ is topologically trivial (non-trivial) with Chern number
$C=1$ and valley Chern number $C_v=-1$, indicating that the system is
valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall insulator. We show that the topology of
each valley is swapped (the Chern number becomes $C=-1$) by reversing the sign
of the exchange field. The system transitions to a valley-polarized metal and
quantum valley Hall phase as V increases. Along the phase boundaries, we
observe a single-Dirac cone semimetal states. These findings shed more light on
the possibility of realizing and controlling topological phases in spintronics
and valleytronics devices.

<h3>Noncollinear twisted RKKY interaction on the optically driven SnTe(001)  surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10668" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10668</a>
<br>
<i>Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Marin Bukov, Michael H. Kolodrubetz</i>
<br>
<br>
The nontrivial spin texture on the (001) surface of topological crystalline
insulator SnTe hosts exotic scientific importance and spintronic applications.
Here, we study the effects of weak Floquet optical driving on the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic
impurities on a doped SnTe(001) surface. Due to peculiar spin-orbit
hybridization, we find a noncollinear twisted RKKY interaction comprising
XYZ-Heisenberg, symmetric in-plane, and asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
terms. We see that contributions from the $z$ ($x$)-component of the
XYZ-Heisenberg (DM) interaction are dominant for most parameters. The
interactions, including DM terms that are responsible for interesting spin
textures, require doping in most cases. We propose to modify the interactions
in situ via optical control of band structure, and thereby doping. A notable
aspect of this control protocol is breaking of electron-hole symmetry, which
stems from the DM interaction.

<h3>Spin dynamics in quantum dots on liquid helium</h3>

<br>
Liquid He-4 is free from magnetic defects, making it an ideal substrate for
electrons with long-lived spin states. Such states can serve as qubit states.
Here we consider the spin states of electrons electrostatically localized in
quantum dots on a helium surface. Efficient gate operations in this system
require spin-orbit coupling. It can be created by a nonuniform magnetic field
from a current-carrying wire, can be turned on and off, and allows one to
obtain large electro-dipole moment and comparatively fast coupling of spins in
neighboring dots. Of central importance is to understand the spin decay due to
the spin-orbit coupling. We establish the leading mechanism of such decay and
show that the decay is sufficiently slow to enable high-fidelity single- and
two-qubit gate operations

<h3>Lattice Model For The Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Moiré Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10685</a>

Inspired by experiments on magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, we present a
lattice mean-field model for the quantum anomalous Hall effect in a moir\'e
setting. Our hopping model thus provides a simple route to a moir\'e Chern
insulator in commensurately twisted models. We present a study of our model in
the ribbon geometry, in which we demonstrate the presence of thick chiral edge
states that have a transverse localization that scales with the moir\'e lattice
spacing. We also study the electronic structure of a domain wall between
opposite Chern insulators. Our model and results are relevant to experiments
that will image or manipulate the moir\'e quantum anomalous Hall edge states.

<h3>Anderson localization of a one-dimensional lattice model with mosaic  quasi-periodic off-diagonal disorders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10715</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Cai Zhang, Rong Yuan, Yongjian Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate Anderson localization of a one-dimensional
lattice with a mosaic off-diagonal quasi-periodic hopping. It is found that the
localization properties of zero-energy states depend sensitively on the parity
of mosaic modulation period $\kappa$. If the mosaic period is an odd integer,
there is no Anderson localization transition for an arbitrarily large
quasiperiodic hopping. The zero-energy state is a critical state. While for an
even number period and a generic quasiperiodic hopping, the zero-energy state
would be a localized edge state at left (or right)-hand end of system. The
above even-odd effects of mosaic period have been also transmitted into the
other eigenstates near zero-energy. More specifically, when mosaic period is
odd, there always exists an energy window in which the eigenstates are critical
for arbitrarily strong quasiperiodic hopping. While for even period, there
exists Anderson localization transition as the hopping strength increases. In
addition, the Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and the mobility edges $E_c$ are
exactly obtained. With the Lyapunov exponent, we further find that there exist
critical regions in the parameter $\tau-E$ (for $\kappa=1$) and $\lambda-E$
(for $\kappa>1$) plane. Furthermore, when $E$ approaches mobility edges $E_c$,
it is found that the critical index of localization length is $\nu=1$. At the
end, we show that the systems with different $E$ can be characterized by
Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and Avila acceleration $\omega(E)$.

<h3>A stochastic method to compute the $L^2$ localisation landscape</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10768</a>

<br>
<br>
The $L^2$ localisation landscape of L. Herviou and J. H. Bardarson is a
generalisation of the localisation landscape of M. Filoche and S. Mayboroda. We
propose a stochastic method to compute the $L^2$ localisation landscape that
enables the calculation of landscapes using sparse matrix methods. We also
propose an energy filtering of the $L^2$ landscape which can be used to to
focus on eigenstates with energies in any chosen range of the energy spectrum.
We demonstrate the utility of these suggestions by applying the $L^2$ landscape
to Anderson's model of localisation in one and two-dimensions, and also to
localisation in a model of the quantum Hall effect.

<h3>First-Principles-Based Insight into Electrochemical Reactivity in a  Cobalt-Carbonate-Hydrate Pseudocapacitor</h3>

Cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CCH) is a pseudocapacitive material with
remarkably high capacitance and cycle stability. Previously, it was reported
that CCH pseudocapacitive materials are orthorhombic in nature. Recent
structural characterization has revealed that they are hexagonal in nature;
however, their H positions still remain unclear. In this work, we carried out
first-principles simulations to identify the H positions. Through the
simulations, we could consider various fundamental deprotonation reactions
inside the crystal and computationally evaluate the electromotive forces (EMF)
of the deprotonation ($V_\mathrm{dp}$). Compared with the experimental
potential window of the reaction ($< 0.6$ V (vs. saturated calomel electrode
(SCE))), the computed $V_\mathrm{dp}$ (vs. SCE) value ($3.05$ V) was beyond the
potential window, indicating that deprotonation never occurred inside the
crystal. This may be attributed to the strongly formed hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds)
in the crystal, thereby leading to the structural stabilization. We further
investigated the crystal anisotropy in an actual capacitive material by
considering the growth mechanism of the CCH crystal. By associating our X-ray
diffraction (XRD) peak simulations with experimental structural analysis, we
found that the H-bonds formed between CCH $\{(\bar{1}\bar{1}\bar{1}),
(2\bar{1}\bar{1}), (2\bar{1}1)\}$ planes (approximately parallel to $ab$-plane)
can result in 1-D growth (stacked along with $c$-axis).

<h3>Topological invariant and domain connectivity in moiré materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10827" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10827</a>

Recently, a moir\'e material has been proposed in which multiple domains of
different topological phases appear in the moir\'e unit cell due to a large
moir\'e modulation. Topological properties of such moir\'e materials may differ
from that of the original untwisted layered material. In this paper, we study
how the topological properties are determined in moir\'e materials with
multiple topological domains. We show a correspondence between the topological
invariant of moir\'e materials at the Fermi level and the topology of the
domain structure in real space. We also find a bulk-edge correspondence that is
compatible with a continuous change of the truncation condition, which is
specific to moir\'e materials. We demonstrate these correspondences in the
twisted Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model by tuning its moir\'e periodic mass term.
These results give a feasible method to evaluate a topological invariant for
all occupied bands of a moir\'e material, and contribute to the design of
topological moir\'e materials and devices.

We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a modified spinless
Haldane-Hubbard model with broken threefold rotational symmetry, employing
exact diagonalization calculations. The interplay of asymmetry, interactions,
and topology gives rise to a rich phase diagram. The non-interacting limit of
the Hamiltonian exhibits a higher-order topological insulator characterized by
the existence of corner modes, in contrast to known chiral edge metallic states
of the standard Haldane model. Our investigation demonstrates that these
symmetry-protected states are robust to the presence of finite interactions.
Furthermore, in certain regimes of parameters, we show that a topological Mott
insulator exists in this model, where a non-trivial topological bulk coexists
with an interaction-driven charge-density-wave, whose emergence is
characterized by a $Z_2$-symmetry breaking within the 3$d$-Ising universality
class.

The spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square-kagome (SK) lattice
has attracted growing attention as a model system of highly frustrated quantum
magnetism. A further motivation for theoretical studies comes from the recent
discovery of SK spin-liquid compounds. The SK antiferromagnet exhibits two
non-equivalent nearest-neighbor bonds $J_1$ and $J_2$. One may expect that in
SK compounds $J_1$ and $J_2$ are of different strength. We present a numerical
study of finite systems by means of the finite-temperature Lanczos method. We
discuss the temperature dependence of the specific heat $C(T)$, the entropy
$S(T)$, and of the susceptibility $X(T)$ of the $J_1$-$J_2$ SK Heisenberg
antiferromagnet varying $J_2/J_1$ in the range $0 \le J_2/J_1 \le 4$. We also
discuss the zero-field ground state of the model. We find indications for a
magnetically disordered singlet ground state for $0 \le J_2/J_1 \lesssim 1.65$.
Beyond $J_2/J_1 \sim 1.65$ the singlet ground state gives way for a
ferrimagnetic ground state. In the region $0.77 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 1.65$
the low-temperature thermodynamics is dominated by a finite singlet-triplet gap
filled with low-lying singlet excitations leading to an exponentially activated
low-temperature behavior of $X(T)$. On the other hand, the low-lying singlets
yield an extra maximum or a shoulder-like profile below the main maximum in the
$C(T)$ curve. For $J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.7$ the low-temperature thermodynamics is
characterized by a large fraction of $N/3$ weakly coupled spins leading to a
sizable amount of entropy at very low temperatures. In an applied magnetic
field the magnetization process features plateaus and jumps in a wide range of
$J_2/J_1$.

Investigation of the electronic and spin structure in double perovskites is
recently attracting significant attention, mainly driven by their unique
multifunctional properties and other underlying charge and spin dynamics.
Herein, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we explore the influence
of variable fractions of Mn3+/Mn4+ cation in different crystallite sizes of
La2NiMnO6 that control the various completing exchange interactions of Ni/Mn
cations responsible for multiple magnetic transitions. The enhanced itinerant
electron due to Mn4+ + Ni2+ to Mn3+ + Ni3+ charge transfer emerged as a
shoulder like characteristics at the low binding energy in the Mn-2P core-level
spectrum. The various approaches such as difference in saturation
magnetization, presence of multiple charge valance, and magnetic entropy
calculations confirm the presence of antisites disorder and it varies as a
function of milling. As milling provides excess energy that helps with
nucleation or cation ordering. Competing magnetic interactions driven by mixed
valences and disorder were established across a cluster glassy phase in the
crystallites. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was utilized to probe
the temperature-driven ferromagnetic-cluster spin-glass transition with
modified g-factor ranging from 2.050 to 2.037. The line width of the ESR
signals increases across the ferromagnetic to cluster-glass phase transition
due to spin freezing. This phase transition is further characterized by
temperature-dependent ac-magnetic susceptibility measurements. Argand diagram
for the ac-susceptibility of the interacting crystallites suggests a collective
magnetization relaxation dynamic in the proximity of spin-glass freezing
temperature of La2NiMnO6.

<h3>Electronic and phonon contributions to the Thermoelectric properties of  newly discovered half-Heusler alloys XHfPb (X= Ni, Pd, and Pt)</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work we calculate the thermoelectric figure of merit of XHfPb (X= Ni,
Pd, and Pt) by computing the both the power factor and the lattice thermal
conductivity by first principles. We make reasonable approximations: we use the
Constant Relaxation Time Approximation (CRTA) to compute the electron transport
contribution and the modified Debye-Callaway model to calculate the thermal
lattice conductivity. We also report the dielectric properties of these
semiconductors and the mode Gr\"uneisen parameters. Not surprisingly we find
that the average Gr\"uneisen coefficient correlates with the tehrmal
conductivity. Next, we consider a realistic relaxation time $\tau$ and carrier
concentration $n$ from experimental data on ZrHfPb and obtain the figure of
merit $ZT$ as a function of temperature. Our main finding is that despite the
Pt is isoelectronic with Ni and Pd, the $ZT$ of PtHfPb is larger and behaves
differently from the other two materials, suggesting that PtHfPb is better
suited for high temperature thermoelectric generators.

Zincblende copper iodide has been attracting growing interest as p-type
semiconductor for applications in transparent electronics and transparent
thermoelectrics. A key step towards technological applications is the
possibility to enhance copper iodide (CuI) conductivity by doping without
deteriorating transparency. A recent high-throughput computational study
revealed that chalcogen substitutions on iodine sites can act as shallow
acceptors. Following computational predictions, doping by oxygen, sulfur and
selenium substitutions on iodine sites has recently been realized in the
laboratory, showing however that few experimental challenges have still to be
tackled on the way to technological applications. We investigate here by means
of {\it ab initio} calculations the effect of such substitutions on the
electronic and optical properties of CuI. Our results suggest that sulfur and
selenium doping are the best candidates to obtain a controllable increase of
hole concentrations, while preserving at the same time transparency in the
visible and high hole mobility.

The interest in the ferroelectric non-volatile memory as a candidate for low

ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. Doping by different elements of hafnia films
allows improving their ferroelectric properties. In this work, the transport
experiments are combined with the simulations to study the evolution of
ferroelectric properties and the mean distance between oxygen vacancies during
the endurance of hafnium-zirconium oxide in metal-ferroelectric-metal

<br>
<br>
In this article, we review the main theoretical methods applied to the study
of liquid Helium adopting a microscopic approach, that is, starting from the
many-particle Hamiltonian of the system. Following an introduction on the first
early approaches, we discuss two main issues. In the first one, we report the
main ingredients of a theoretical approach based on the variational method,
with the discussion of the high accuracy obtained with them and the related
progress in the design of highly accurate trial wave functions. In the second
part, the main stochastic methods used in this study are briefly discussed.
Altogether reflects the strong links between the study of liquid Helium and the
progress in the development of new and extremely powerful approaches to deal
with one of the most strongly quantum many-body systems in Nature.

<br>
<br>
Parametric instabilities in interacting systems can lead to the appearance of
new structures or patterns. In quantum gases, two-body interactions are
responsible for a variety of instabilities that depend on the characteristics
of both trapping and interactions. We report on the Floquet engineering of such
instabilities, on a Bose-Einstein condensate held in a time-modulated optical
lattice. The modulation triggers a destabilization of the condensate into a
state exhibiting a density modulation with a new spatial periodicity. This new
crystal-like order directly depends on the modulation parameters: the interplay
between the Floquet spectrum and interactions generates narrow and adjustable
instability regions, leading to the growth, from quantum or thermal
fluctuations, of modes with a density modulation non commensurate with the
lattice spacing. This study demonstrates the production of metastable exotic
states of matter through Floquet engineering, and paves the way for further
studies of dissipation in the resulting phase, and of similar phenomena in
other geometries.

<br>
<br>
Three dimensional difference pair distribution functions from X-ray and
neutron diffraction experiments are reported for yttria stabilized zirconia
(Zr$_{0.82}$Y$_{0.18}$O$_{1.91}$). We use a quantitative analysis of the
signatures in the 3D-$\Delta$PDFs to establish that oxygen ions neighbouring a
vacancy shift by 0.515(5)~\AA\ along $\langle 1,0,0 \rangle$ towards the
vacancy while metal ions neighbouring a vacancy shift by 0.269(2)~\AA\ along
$\langle 1,1,1 \rangle$ away from the vacancy. The neutron 3D-$\Delta$PDF shows
a tendency for vacancies to cluster along $\langle
\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\rangle$, which results in 6-fold
coordinated metal ions.

<h3>Accurate computation of chemical contrast in field ion microscopy</h3>

<br>
<i>Shalini Bhatt, Shyam Katnagallu, Jörg Neugebauer, Christoph Freysoldt</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a computational approach to simulate local contrast observed in
Field Ion Microscopy (FIM). It is based on density-functional theory utilizing
the Tersoff-Hamann approach as done in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). A
key requirement is the highly accurate computation of the surface states'
wave-function tails. To refine the Kohn-Sham states from standard iterative
global solvers we introduce and discuss the EXtrapolation of Tails via Reverse
integration Algorithm (EXTRA). The decaying tails are obtained by reverse
integration (from outside in) using a Numerov-like algorithm. The starting
conditions are then iteratively adapted to match the values of plane-wave
Kohn-Sham wave functions close to the surface. We demonstrate the performance
of the proposed algorithm by analysing and showing the chemical contrast for Ta
at Ni surface.

<h3>Charge trapping and recombination in dipolar field of charged defect  cluster in silicon</h3>

Extensive irradiation of silicon crystal sensors by high energy particles in
e. g. accelerators yield defect clusters of different types. Trapping of
electrons and holes result in extended internal electric fields that drive
remaining free charges. The question whether these internal electric fields
affect the experimental observables, e.g. recombination process and lifetime of
free charges is the main focus of this paper. Including the drift and diffusion
of electrons and holes we calculate the recombination rate in a cubic sample
with a single dipolar cluster of defects. It is shown that the large effect on
charge lifetime is to be expected when charge diffusion length during the
charge lifetime is comparable to the dimensions of the cluster. If the
diffusion length exceeds the cluster size, the cluster barely affects the
recombination rate.

<h3>High-temperature stable refractory high-entropy nanoalloys with enhanced  sinterability</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nanocrystalline alloys (nanoalloys) are prone to grain growth. It is known
that grain boundary segregation and precipitation can stabilize nanoalloys, but
the stabilization becomes less effective at high temperatures and adding grain
growth inhibitors often reduces sinterability. Herein, we have simultaneously
achieved improved sinterability and exceptional high-temperature stability for
a class of MoNbTaTiW-based refractory high-entropy nanoalloys (RHENs). Bulk
pellets of RHENs were fabricated through planetary ball milling and spark
plasma sintering, achieving 93-96% relative densities with 50-100 nm grain
sizes for three compositions. For example, Mo17.8Nb17.8Ta17.8Ti17.8W17.8Ni6Zr5
sintered at 1300 {\deg}C attained ~96% relative density with ~55 nm mean grain
size. Moreover, these RHENs exhibited exceptional stability at 1300 {\deg}C.
Both Ti17.8Nb17.8Mo17.8Ta17.8W17.8Ni6Zr5 and Mo18.8Nb18.8Ta18.8Ti18.8W18.8Ni6
retained <150 nm grain sizes with >96% of the theoretical densities after five
hours annealing at 1300 {\deg}C. Notably, the addition of Ni, a well-known
sintering aid for activated sintering of refractory metals such as W and Mo, in
high-entropy MoNbTaTiW can promote sintering while maintaining high-temperature
stability against rapid grain growth, which can be explained by hypothesized
effects of high-entropy grain boundaries. These RHENs possess some of the
highest temperature stability achieved for nanoalloys and ultrafine-grained
metals.

<br>

Topological physics has revolutionised materials science, introducing
topological insulators and superconductors with applications from smart
materials to quantum computing. Bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) is a core
concept therein, where the non-trivial topology of a material's bulk predicts
localized topological states at its boundaries. However, edge states also exist
in systems where BBC is seemingly violated, leaving any topological origin
unknown. For finite-frequency mechanical metamaterials, BBC has hitherto been
described in terms of displacements, necessitating fixed boundaries to identify
topologically protected edge modes. Herein, we introduce a new family of
finite-frequency mechanical metamaterials whose topological properties emerge
in strain coordinates for free boundaries. We show two examples, the first
being the canonical mass-dimer, where BBC in strain coordinates reveals the
previously unknown topological origin of its edge modes. Second, we introduce a
new mechanical analog of the Majorana-supporting Kitaev chain. We theoretically
and experimentally show that this Kitaev chain supports edge states for both
free and fixed boundaries, wherein BBC is established in strains and
displacements, respectively. Our findings suggest a previously undiscovered
class of topological edge modes may exist, including within other settings such
as electrical circuits and optics, and for more complex, tailored boundaries
with coordinates other than strain.

<h3>Prediction of steel nanohardness by using graph neural networks on  surface polycrystallinity maps</h3>

<br>
<br>
As a bulk mechanical property, nanoscale hardness in polycrystalline metals
is strongly dependent on microstructural features that are believed to be
heavily influenced from complex features of polycrystallinity -- namely,
individual grain orientations and neighboring grain properties. We train a
graph neural network (GNN) model, with each grain center location being a graph
node, to assess the predictability of micromechanical responses of
nano-indented low-carbon 310S stainless steel (alloyed with Ni and Cr)
surfaces, solely based on surface polycrystallinity, captured by electron
backscatter diffraction maps. The grain size distribution ranges between
$1-100~\mu$m, with mean grain size at $18~\mu$m. The GNN model is trained on a
set of nanomechanical load-displacement curves, obtained from nanoindentation
tests and is subsequently used to make predictions of nano-hardness at various
depths, with sole input being the grain locations and orientations. Model
training is based on a sub-standard set of $\sim10^2$ hardness measurements,
leading to an overall satisfactory performance. We explore model performance
and its dependence on various structural/topological grain-level descriptors,
such as the grain size and number of nearest neighbors. Analogous GNN model
frameworks may be utilized for quick, inexpensive hardness estimates, for
guidance to detailed nanoindentation experiments, akin to cartography tool
developments in the world exploration era.

<h3>Automated identification of linear viscoelastic constitutive laws with  EUCLID</h3>

<br>
<i>Enzo Marino, Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis</i>
<br>
<br>
We extend EUCLID, a computational strategy for automated material model
discovery and identification, to linear viscoelasticity. For this case, we
perform a priori model selection by adopting a generalized Maxwell model
expressed by a Prony series, and deploy EUCLID for identification. The
methodology is based on four ingredients: i. full-field displacement and net
force data; ii. a very wide material model library - in our case, a very large
number of terms in the Prony series; iii. the linear momentum balance
constraint; iv. the sparsity constraint. The devised strategy comprises two
stages. Stage 1 relies on sparse regression; it enforces momentum balance on
the data and exploits sparsity-promoting regularization to drastically reduce
the number of terms in the Prony series and identify the material parameters.
Stage 2 relies on k-means clustering; starting from the reduced set of terms
from stage 1, it further reduces their number by grouping together Maxwell
elements with very close relaxation times and summing the corresponding moduli.
Automated procedures are proposed for the choice of the regularization
parameter in stage 1 and of the number of clusters in stage 2. The overall
strategy is demonstrated on artificial numerical data, both without and with
the addition of noise, and shown to efficiently and accurately identify a
linear viscoelastic model with five relaxation times across four orders of
magnitude, out of a library with several hundreds of terms spanning relaxation
times across seven orders of magnitude.

<h3>Umklapp scattering in the one-dimensional Hubbard model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Mott metal-insulator transition is a typical strong correlation effect
triggered by the Umklapp scattering. However, in a physical system, the Umklapp
scattering coexists with the normal scattering, including both forward and
backward scattering, which conserves the total momentum of scattered electrons.
Therefore, it is not easy to quantify the contribution of the Umklapp
scattering in a Mott metal-insulator transition. To resolve this difficulty, we
propose to explore these scattering processes separately. We study the
contribution of each scattering process in the one-dimensional Hubbard model
using the momentum-space density-matrix renormalization group (kDMRG) and
bosonization methods. Our kDMRG calculation confirms that the Mott charge gap
results from the Umklapp scattering, but the normal scattering processes
strongly renormalize its value. Furthermore, we present a scaling analysis of
the Mott charge gap in the bosonization theory and show that the interplay
between the Umklapp and forward scattering dictates the charge dynamics in the
half-filled Hubbard model.

<h3>Effect of Ti addition on the structural, thermodynamic, and elastic  properties of $Ti_{x}(HfNbTaZr)_{(1-x)/4}$ alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
The structure and thermodynamic properties of $Ti_{x}(HfNbTaZr)_{(1-x)/4}$
refractory highly entropy multicomponent alloys have been studied using a
comprehensive Monte-Carlo Special Quasi-random Structure (MCSQS) realization of
the disordered atomic structure and DFT calculations. We have shown that to
model the random structure in a small supercell, it is necessary to study a
large space of random configurations with respect to the nearest shells.
Mimicking the randomness with the many-body terms does not lead to significant
improvements in the formation energy but modeling the random structure with the
few nearest neighbor pairs leads to improvements in the formation energy. We
have also demonstrated the existence of weak to intermediate SRO for equimolar
compositions. Chemical ordering is studied by linking a large number of MCSQS
realizations to DFT calculations, and the SRO results are rationalized in terms
of the crystallographic structure of the element pairs and binary phase
diagrams. The formation energy of $Ti_{x}(HfNbTaZr)_{(1-x)/4}$ alloys remains
slightly positive for all $x$ when Ti is added. For $x$ > 0.5, a phase
transition in favor of an hcp structure is observed in agreement with the Bo-Md
diagram. A dual phase is predicted at $x$ = 0.5. The Ti content in this class
of alloys appears to be a practical way to select the phase structure and
tailor the structure and elastic properties to specific applications.

In a magnetic texture, the spin of a conduction electron is forced to be
aligned to the localized moment. As a result, the topology of the magnetic
texture affects the electron dynamics in nontrivial ways. A representative
example is the topological Hall effect in noncoplanar spin textures with finite
spin chirality. While propagating in the noncoplanar spin texture, electrons
acquire Berry phase, and their motion is deflected as if they were in a
magnetic field. Here, we report a distinct Berry phase effect in a coplanar
helimagnet: the spin moment of the conduction electron is polarized under
electric currents depending on the chirality of the helimagnet. The accumulated
spin polarization works as a source of spin current, and the chirality can be
detected by the inverse spin Hall mechanism. The functionality allows us to
read out the chirality without magnetic fields, and therefore paves the way to
future helimagnet-based spintronics.

<h3>Interpenetrated biosurfactant-biopolymer orthogonal hydrogels: the  biosurfactant's phase controls the hydrogel's mechanics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Controlling the viscoelastic properties of hydrogels is a challenge for many
applications. Low molecular weight gelators (LMWG) like bile salts and
glycolipids, and biopolymers like chitosan and alginate, are good candidates
for developing fully biobased hybrid hydrogels that combine the advantages of
both components. Biopolymers lead to enhanced mechanics while LMWG add
functionality. In this work, hybrid hydrogels are composed of biopolymers
(gelatin, chitosan, alginate) and microbial glycolipid bioamphiphiles, known as
biosurfactants. Besides their biocompatibility and natural origin,
bioamphiphiles can present chameleonic behavior, as pH and ions control their
phase diagram in water around neutrality under strongly diluted conditions (< 5
wt%). The glycolipid used in this work behaves like a surfactant (micellar
phase) at high pH or like a phospholipid (vesicle phase) at low pH. Moreover,
at neutral-to-alkaline pH in the presence of calcium, it behaves like a gelator
(fiber phase). The impact of each of these phases on the elastic properties of
biopolymers is explored by means of oscillatory rheology, while the hybrid
structure is studied by small angle X-ray scattering. The micellar and
vesicular phase reduce the elastic properties of the hydrogels, while the fiber
phase has the opposite effect, it enhances the hydrogel's strength by forming
an interpenetrated biopolymer-LMWG network.

<br>
<br>
We study the effects of symmetry-breaking perturbations in the
out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of many-body systems slowly driven across a
continuous quantum transition (CQT) by a time-dependent symmetry-preserving
parameter. For this purpose, we analize the out-of-equilibrium dynamics arising
from generalized Kibble-Zurek (KZ) protocols, within a dynamic
renormalization-group framework allowing for finite-size systems. We show that
the time dependence of generic observables develops an out-of-equilibrium
finite-size scaling (FSS) behavior, arising from the interplay between the time
scale $t_s$ of the parameter variations in the KZ protocol, the size $L$ of the
system, and the strength $h$ of the symmetry-breaking perturbation, in the
limit of large $t_s$ and $L$. Moreover, scaling arguments based on the
first-order adiabatic approximation of slow variations in quantum systems allow
us to characterize the approach to the adiabatic regimes for some limits of the
model parameters (for example when we take $t_s\to \infty$ before
$L\to\infty$), predicting asymptotic power-law suppressions of the nonadiabatic
behaviors in the adiabatic limits. This out-of-equilibrium FSS is supported by
numerical analyses for the paradigmatic quantum Ising chain along generalized
KZ protocols, with a time-dependent transverse field crossing its CQT, in the
presence of a static longitudinal field breaking its $Z_2$ symmetry.

The characterization of quantum spin liquid phases in Kitaev materials has
been a subject of intensive studies over the recent years, both theoretically
and experimentally. Most theoretical studies have focused on an isotropically
interacting model with its coupling strength being equivalent on each bond in
an attempt to simplify the problem. Here, we study an extended spin-1/2
Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model on a honeycomb lattice with an additional tuning
parameter that controls the coupling strength on one of the bonds: we connect
the limit of isolated Kitaev-$\Gamma$ chains, which is known to exhibit an
emergent $SU(2)_1$ Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase [Yang et al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 124}, 147205 (2020)], to the two-dimensional model. We report on an
instance, in which the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid persists for finite
inter-chain coupling. A quantum spin liquid phase develops in analogy to
\emph{sliding Luttinger liquids} that differs from the Kitaev spin liquid. This
quantum spin liquid phase features spinon-like excitations similar to those of
the antiferromatnetic Heisenberg chain. We use numerical Exact Diagonalization
and Density Matrix Renormalization Group on various cluster geometries in a
complementary way to overcome finite-size limitations.

The geometric phase is known to play a role both in the rotation of the
Foucault pendulum and in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the Berry
curvature. Here, we show that a 2D harmonic oscillator with AHE induced by
Berry curvature behaves exactly like the Foucault pendulum: in both, the plane
of the oscillations rotates with time. The rotating pendulum configuration
enhances the AHE, simplifying its observation and allowing high-precision
measurements of the Berry curvature. We also show how the non-adiabaticity and
anharmonicity determine the maximal rotation angle and find the optimal
conditions for the observations.

<br>
<br>
The spin-dependent scattering process in a system of topological insulator
and quantum dot is studied. The unitary scattering process is viewed as a gate
transformation applied to an initial state of two electrons. Due to the
randomness imposed through the impurities and alloying-induced effects of band
parameters, the formalism of the random unitary gates is implemented. For
quantifying entanglement in the system, we explored concurrence and
ensemble-averaged R\'enyi entropy. We found that applied external magnetic
field leads to long-range entanglement on the distances much larger than the
confinement length. We showed that topological features of itinerant electrons
sustain the formation of robust long-distance entanglement, which survives even
in the presence of a strong disorder.

<br>
<br>
We studied a rotating BEC confined in a bubble trap, approximated by a
Mexican hat and shifted harmonic oscillator potentials. Using a variational
technique and perturbation theory, we determined the vortex configurations in
this system by varying the interparticle interaction and the angular velocity
of the atomic cloud. We found that the phase diagram of the system has
macrovortex structures for small positive values of the interaction parameter,
and the charge of the central vortex increases with rotation. Strengthening the
atomic interaction makes the macrovortex unstable and decays into multiple
singly-charged vortices that arrange themselves in a lattice configuration. We
also look for experimentally realizable methods to determine the vortex
configuration without relying upon absorption imaging since the structures are
not always visible in the latter. More specifically, we study how the vortex
distribution affects the collective modes of the condensate by solving the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically and by analytical predictions using the
sum-rule approach for the frequencies of the modes. These results reveal
important signatures to characterize the macrovortices and vortex lattice
transitions in the experiments.

<br>
<br>
We present a Wigner function-based approach for the particle density
evolution in fermionic and bosonic open quantum many-body systems, including
the effects of dephasing. In particular, we focus on chains of non-interacting
particles coupled to Lindblad baths. The dissipative processes, described by
linear and quadratic jump operators, are modulated by inhomogeneous couplings.
Following a semi-classical approach, we find the differential equation
governing the Wigner function evolution, which can be solved in closed form in
some particular cases. We check the accuracy of the Wigner approach in
different scenarios (i.e. Gaussian jump frequencies), describing the density
evolution and the transport phenomena in terms of classical quasi-particles.

<h3>Fermi-arc metals</h3>

<br>

We predict a novel metallic state of matter that emerges in a Weyl-semimetal
superstructure with spatially varying Weyl-node positions. In the new state,
the Weyl nodes are stretched into extended, anisotropic Fermi surfaces, which
can be understood as being built from Fermi arc-like states. This "Fermi-arc
metal" exhibits the chiral anomaly of the parental Weyl semimetal. However,
unlike in the parental Weyl semimetal, in the Fermi-arc metal the
"ultra-quantum state", in which the anomalous chiral Landau level is the only
state at the Fermi energy, is already reached for a finite energy window at
zero magnetic field. The dominance of the ultra-quantum state implies a
universal low-field ballistic magnetoconductance and the absence of quantum
oscillations, making the Fermi surface "invisible" to de Haas-van Alphen and
Shubnikov-de Haas effects, although it signifies its presence in other response
properties.

<h3>Rare collapse of fermionic quasiparticles upon coupling to local bosons</h3>

<br>
<i>Piotr Wrzosek, Adam Kłosiński, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Cliò Efthimia Agrapidis</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the stability of the fermionic quasiparticle in a fermion-boson
model on a Bethe lattice, with fermions interacting with local bosons by
Peierls coupling. We solve the problem by mapping it onto a non-interacting
chain with site-dependent potential. We show that, despite a finite number of
bosonic excitations costing zero energy, it is hard for the quasiparticle to
completely collapse. The quasiparticle disappearance becomes easier with an
increase in: (i) the total number of bosons with zero energy, and (ii) the
relative strength of the coupling between bosons and fermions. The postulated
model can, among other things, be applied to study systems in which fermions
are introduced into antiferromagnetic (or antiferro-orbital) domains surrounded
by ferromagnetic (or ferro-orbital) ordered states. This might take place in
the overdoped cuprates or upon doping manganese or vanadium oxides. Finally, we
show how this model leads to an in-depth understanding of the onset of
quasiparticles in the 1D and 2D $t$-$J^z$ model.

<h3>Defeating depolarizing fields with artificial flux closure in ultrathin  ferroelectrics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Material surfaces encompass structural and chemical discontinuities that
often lead to the loss of the property of interest in the so-called dead
layers. It is notably problematic in nanoscale oxide electronics, where the
integration of strongly correlated materials into devices is obstructed by the
thickness threshold required for the emergence of their functionality. Here, we
report the stabilization of ultrathin out-of-plane ferroelectricity in oxide
heterostructures through the design of an artificial flux-closure architecture.
Inserting an in-plane polarized ferroelectric epitaxial buffer provides
continuity of polarization at the interface, and despite its insulating nature
we observe the emergence of polarization in our out-of-plane-polarized model
ferroelectric BaTiO$_{3}$ from the very first unit cell. In BiFeO$_{3}$, the
flux-closure approach stabilizes a conceptually novel 251$^{\circ}$ domain
wall. Its unusual chirality is likely associated with the ferroelectric analog
to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We thus see that in an adaptively
engineered geometry, the depolarizing-field-screening properties of an
insulator can even surpass those of a metal and be a source of new
functionalities. This should be a useful insight on the road towards the next
generation of ferroelectric-based oxide electronics.

<h3>Theory of Critical Phenomena with Long-Range Temporal Interaction</h3>

<br>
<br>
We develop a systematic theory for the critical phenomena with memory in all
spatial dimensions, including $d<d_c$, $d=d_c$, and $d>d_c$, the upper critical
dimension. We show that the Hamiltonian plays a unique role in dynamics and the
dimensional constant $\mathfrak{d}_t$ that embodies the intimate relationship
between space and time is the fundamental ingredient of the theory. However,
its value varies with the space dimension continuously and vanishes exactly at
$d=4$, reflecting reasonably the variation of the amount of the temporal
dimension that is transferred to the spatial one with the strength of
fluctuations. Such variations of the temporal dimension save all scaling laws
though the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is violated. Various new
universality classes emerge.

<h3>A symmetry-protected exceptional ring in a photonic crystal with  negative index media</h3>

<i>Takuma Isobe, Tsuneya Yoshida, Yasuhiro Hatsugai</i>
<br>
<br>
Non-Hermitian topological band structures such as symmetry-protected
exceptional rings (SPERs) can emerge for systems described by the generalized
eigenvalue problem (GEVP) with Hermitian matrices. In this paper, we
numerically analyze a photonic crystal with negative index media, which is
described by the GEVP with Hermitian matrices. Our analysis using COMSOL
Multiphysics demonstrates that a SPER emerges for photonic crystals composed of
split-ring resonators and metal-wire structures. We expect that the above SPER
can be observed in experiments as it emerges at a finite frequency.

<h3>Josephson effect in excitonic chiral double layers</h3>

<br>
<i>Klaus Ziegler</i>
<br>
<br>
Considering s-wave pairing in an electron-hole double layer of two chiral
metals, we study the Josephson effect generated by a domain wall. The latter,
which is caused by a jump of the order parameter phase, creates two independent
evanescent zero-energy modes at an exceptional point. A unique solution is
found by coupling the quasiparticle currents to the supercurrents via the
continuity equation. This leads to a superposition of the zero-energy modes,
where the relative phases of the coefficients are linked to the direction of
the macroscopic supercurrents. Assuming a toroidal geometry, the effective
Josephson current winds around the domain walls. Such a system can be realized
as the surface of a ring-shaped topological insulator.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate a flip-chip-based approach to microwave measurements of
Andreev bound states in a gate-tunable planar Josephson junction using
inductively-coupled superconducting low-loss resonators. By means of
electrostatic gating, we present control of both the density and transmission
of Andreev bound states. Phase biasing of the device shifted the resonator
frequency, consistent with the modulation of supercurrent in the junction.
Two-tone spectroscopy measurements revealed an isolated Andreev bound state
consistent with an average induced superconducting gap of $184~\mathrm{\mu eV}$
and a gate-tunable transmission approaching $0.98$. Our results represent the
feasibility of using the flip-chip technique to address and study Andreev bound
states in planar Josephson junctions, and they give a promising path towards
microwave applications with superconductor-semiconductor two-dimensional
materials.

<h3>Quench induced chaotic dynamics of Anderson localized interacting  Bose-Einstein condensates in one dimension</h3>

<br>
<i>Swarup Sarkar, Tapan Mishra, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj K. Mishra</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effect of atomic interaction on the localization and the
associated dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a one-dimensional
quasiperiodic optical lattice and random speckle potentials. When the
interactions are absent, the condensates exhibit localization, which weakens as
we increase the interaction strength beyond a threshold value for both
potential types. We inspect the localized and delocalized states by perturbing
the system via quenching the interaction strength instantaneously to zero and
studying the corresponding dynamics, which we further corroborate using the
out-of-time-order correlator. The temporal behaviour of the time correlator
displays regular dynamics for the localized state, while it shows temporal
chaos for the delocalized state. We confirm this dynamical behaviour by
analyzing the power spectral density of the time correlator. We further
identify that the condensate admits a quasiperiodic route to chaotic dynamics
for both potentials. Finally, we present the variation of the maximal Lyapunov
exponents for different nonlinearity and disorder strength that have a positive
value in the regime where the time correlator function show chaotic behaviour.
Through this, we establish the strong connection between the spatially
delocalized state of the condensate and its temporal chaos.

<i>Andrés Santos, Mariano López de Haro</i>
<br>
<br>
In a previous work, a simple approach to derive the jamming packing fraction
of a hard-sphere mixture from the knowledge of the random close-packing
fraction of the monocomponent system was proposed. Now, an extension of that
approach is applied to provide an approximate formula for the densest packing
fraction of a given hard-sphere mixture in terms of the fcc close-packing
fraction of a monocomponent hard-sphere system and of a single parameter
encapsulating the dependence on the size ratios and the number of spheres in
the unit cell. Comparison with recent results for such densest packing fraction
of binary and ternary systems is performed and reasonable agreement is
obtained.

We characterize the full spatiotemporal gait of populations of swimming {\it

intermediate scattering functions. This allows us to demonstrate quantitatively
how the persistence length of an engineered strain can be controlled by a
chemical inducer and to report a controlled transition from perpetual tumbling
to smooth swimming. For wild-type {\it E.~coli}, we measure simultaneously the
microscopic motility parameters and the large-scale effective diffusivity,
hence quantitatively bridging for the first time small-scale directed swimming
and macroscopic diffusion.

The spin susceptibility is an important probe to characterize the symmetry of
the order parameter in unconventional superconductors. Among them, nonunitary
triplet superconductors have attracted a lot of attention recently in the
context of the search for topological superconductivity. Here, we derive a
general formula for the spin susceptibility of nonunitary triplet
superconductors within a single-band model of non-magnetic, centrosymmetric
materials with strong spin-orbit coupling. We use it to critically assess
experimental claims of nonunitary triplet superconductivity in some materials.
