<h3>Atomic cluster expansion for Pt-Rh catalysts: From ab initio to the  simulation of nanoclusters in few steps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07465" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07465</a>

<br>
Insight into structural and thermodynamic properties of nanoparticles is
crucial for designing optimal catalysts with enhanced activity and stability.
We present a semi-automated workflow for parameterizing the atomic cluster
expansion (ACE) from ab initio data. The main steps of the workflow are the
generation of training data from accurate electronic structure calculations, an
efficient fitting procedure supported by active learning and uncertainty
indication, and a thorough validation. We apply the workflow to the simulation
of binary Pt-Rh nanoparticles that are important for catalytic applications. We
demonstrate that the Pt-Rh ACE is able to reproduce accurately a broad range of
fundamental properties of the elemental metals as well as their compounds while
retaining an outstanding computational efficiency. This enables a direct
comparison of simulations to high resolution experiments.

<h3>Like-charge attraction in one- and two-dimensional Coulomb systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
The bare Coulomb interaction between two like-charges is repulsive. When
these charges are immersed in an electrolyte, the thermal fluctuations of the
ions turn the bare Coulomb interaction into an effective interaction between
the two charges. An interesting question arises: is it possible that the
effective interaction becomes attractive for like-charges? We will show how
this like-charge attraction phenomenon is indeed predicted in some one- and
two-dimensional models of Coulomb systems. Exact analytical results can be
obtained for these Coulomb systems models due to some connections that they
have with integrable field theories. We will explain the techniques that allow
obtaining exact results for the correlation functions between like-charge
particles and how, under certain circumstances, the natural repulsion
interaction shifts to being attractive. Although the technical details differ
for 1d or 2d systems, the physical cause of this phenomenon is rooted in a
three-body interaction between the two like-charges and an ion of the
electrolyte with an opposite charge.

<h3>Exploring the Elastic Properties and Fracture Patterns of Me-Graphene  Monolayers and Nanotubes through Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07518" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07518</a>

<br>
<br>
Me-graphene (MeG) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope. It is
composed of sp$^2$- and sp$^3$-hybridized carbon atoms assembled topologically
from C$-$(C$_3$H$_2$)$_4$ molecules. Due to its attractive electronic and
structural properties, it is important to study the mechanical behavior of MeG
in its monolayer and nanotube topologies. In this work, we carried out fully
atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations using the ReaxFF force field
to investigate their mechanical properties and fracture patterns. Our results
indicate that Young's modulus of MeG monolayers is about 511 GPa and in the
range of 583-664 GPa for the nanotubes investigated here. Moreover, MeG
monolayers exhibit a direct transition from elastic to complete fracture under
critical strain without a plastic regime, while MeG nanotubes show an extended
flat plastic regime before total fracture.

<h3>Flocking without alignment interactions in attractive active Brownian  particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07746" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07746</a>
<br>
<i>Lorenzo Caprini, Hartmut Löwen</i>
<br>
<br>
Within a simple model of attractive active Brownian particles, we predict
flocking behavior and challenge the widespread idea that alignment interactions
are necessary to observe this collective phenomenon. Here, we show that even
non-aligning attractive interactions can lead to a flocking state. Monitoring
the velocity polarization as the order parameter, we reveal the onset of a
first-order transition from a disordered phase, characterized by several small
clusters, to a flocking phase, where a single flocking cluster is emerging. The
scenario is confirmed by studying the spatial connected correlation function of
particle velocities, which reveals scale-free behavior in flocking states and
exponential-like decay for non-flocking configurations. Our predictions can be
tested in microscopic and macroscopic experiments showing flocking, such as
animals, migrating cells, and active colloids.

<h3>Structure and diffusion of active-passive binary mixtures in a  single-file</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07843</a>
<br>
<i>Tanwi Debnath, Shubhadip Nayak, Poulami Bag, Debajyoti Debnath, Pulak Kumar Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically study structure and dynamics of single files composed of
active particles, as well as, active-passive binary mixtures. Our simulation
results show that when the persistent length of self-propelled particles is
much larger than the average inter-particle separation and the self-propulsion
velocity is larger than the thermal velocity, particles in the file exist as
clusters of various sizes. Average cluster size and structures of the file are
very sensitive to self-propulsion properties, thermal fluctuations and
composition of the mixture. In addition to the variation of file composition,
our study considers two sorts of mixture configurations. One corresponds to the
uniform distribution of active passive throughout the mixture in the single
file. In the other configuration, active particles are on one side of the file.
For the both configurations, even a little fraction of active particles
produces a large impact on the structure and dynamics of the file.

<h3>Run-and-tumble motion in a linear ratchet potential: analytic solution,  power extraction and first-passage properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07880</a>
<br>
<i>Connor Roberts, Zigan Zhen</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the properties of a system of run-and-tumble (RnT) particles
moving in a piecewise-linear ``ratchet'' potential, and subject to
non-negligible diffusion, by deriving exact analytical results for its
steady-state probability density, current, entropy production rate, power
output, and thermodynamic efficiency. The current, and thus the extractable
power and efficiency, have non-monotonic dependencies on the diffusion
strength, ratchet height, and particle self-propulsion speed, peaking at finite
values in each case. In the case where the particles' self-propulsion is
completely suppressed by the force from the ratchet, and thus a current can be
generated only by diffusion-mediated barrier crossings, the system's entropy
production rate remains finite in the limit of vanishing diffusion. In the
final part of this work, we consider RnT motion in a linear ratchet potential
on a bounded interval, allowing the derivation of mean first-passage times and
splitting probabilities for different boundary and initial conditions. The
present work resides at the interface of exactly solvable models of
run-and-tumble motion and the study of work extraction from active matter by
providing exact expressions pertaining to the feasibility and future design of
active engines. Our results are in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

<h3>Antiskyrmionic ferroelectric medium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07389" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07389</a>
<br>
<i>Mauro A. P. Gonçalves, Marek Paściak, Jiří Hlinka</i>

<br>
Magnetization knots, known as ferromagnetic skyrmions, are string-like
nanoobjects with a vortex-like spin texture. By now they have been found in
many chiral ferromagnets. At the same time, there is only one material known to
form geometrically equivalent vortices of ferroelectric polarization, the
crystal of lead titanate. Our density functional theory based atomistic
simulations now reveal that in a related material barium titanate, intrinsic
string-like vortexes of another type are stable instead of skyrmions -
ferroelectric antiskyrmions. They remind ring windings of decorative knots,
have just 2-3 nm in diameter, possess a hexagonal section and an exotic
topological charge of minus two. These findings suggest that ferroelectrics
might in principle serve as memory media operating with nanoscale topological
line defects and that they could be antiskyrmion forming media rather than
skyrmion media.

<h3>Influence of Entropy Changes on First Passage Time in the Thermodynamics  of trajectories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07398" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07398</a>
<br>
<i>V. V. Ryazanov</i>
<br>
<br>
For the thermodynamics of trajectories, an ensemble containing the variables
of dynamic activity and first-passage time (FPT) is considered. The dependence
of the average FPT on the total non-negative change in entropy is obtained.
Depending on whether entropy flows into or out of the system, the average FPT
increases or decreases as the total entropy change increases. The same
dependences were obtained for the dispersions of dynamic activity and FPT, as
well as for the correlation of dynamic activity and FPT.

<h3>Memory induced Magnus effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07416" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07416</a>
<br>
<i>Xin Cao, Debankur Das, Niklas Windbacher, Felix Ginot, Matthias Krüger, Clemens Bechinger</i>
<br>
<br>
Spinning objects which move through air or liquids experience a Magnus force.
This effect is commonly exploited in ball sports but also of considerable
importance for applications and fundamental science. Opposed to large objects
where Magnus forces are strong, they are only weak at small scales and
eventually vanish for overdamped micron-sized particles in simple liquids. Here
we demonstrate an about one-million-fold enhanced Magnus force of spinning
colloids in viscoelastic fluids. Such fluids are characterized by a
time-delayed response to external perturbations which causes a deformation of
the fluidic network around the moving particle. When the particle additionally
spins, the deformation field becomes misaligned relative to the particle's
moving direction, leading to a force perpendicular to the direction of travel
and the spinning axis. The presence of strongly enhanced memory-induced Magnus
forces at microscales opens novel applications for particle sorting and
steering, the creation and visualization of anomalous flows and more.

<h3>Water dissociation on pristine low-index TiO2 surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07433</a>
<br>
<i>Zezhu Zeng, Felix Wodaczek, Keyang Liu, Frederick Stein, Jürg Hutter, Ji Chen, Bingqing Cheng</i>
<br>
<br>
Water absorption and dissociation processes on pristine low-index TiO$_2$
interfaces are important but poorly understood outside the well-studied anatase
(101) and rutile (110). To understand these, we construct three sets of machine
learning potentials that are simultaneously applicable to various TiO$_2$
surfaces, based on three density-functional-theory approximations. We compute
the water dissociation free energies on seven pristine TiO$_2$ surfaces, and
predict that anatase (100), anatase (110), rutile (001), and rutile (011)
surfaces favor water dissociation, anatase (101) and rutile (100) surfaces have
mostly molecular absorption, while the calculated dissociation fraction on
rutile (110) surface may depend on the density functional assumed. Moreover,
using an automated algorithm, we reveal that these surfaces follow different
types of atomistic mechanisms for proton transfer and water dissociation:
one-step, two-step, or both. Our finding thus demonstrates that the different
pristine TiO$_2$ surfaces react with water in distinct ways, and cannot be
represented using just the low-energy anatase (101) and rutile (110) surfaces.

<h3>Unusual magnetotransport and anomalous Hall effect in  quasi-two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07440" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07440</a>
<br>
<i>Riju Pal, Buddhadeb Pal, Suchanda Mondal, Prabhat Mandal, Atindra Nath Pal</i>
<br>
<br>
Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, an itinerant vdW ferromagnet (FM) having Curie temperature
(T$_C$) close to room temperature ($\sim 270$ K), exhibits another transition
(T$_{SR}$ $\sim$ 120 K) where the easy axis of magnetization changes from
in-plane to the out-of-plane direction in addition to T$_C$. Here, we have
studied the magnetotransport in a multilayer Hall bar device fabricated on 300
nm Si/SiO$_2$ substrate. Interestingly, the zero field resistivity shows a
negligible change in resistivity near T$_C$ unlike the typical metallic FM,
whereas, it exhibits a dramatic fall below T$_{SR}$. Also, the resistivity
shows a weak anomaly at T $ \sim $ 38 K (T$_Q$), below which the resistivity
shows a quadratic temperature dependence according to the Fermi liquid
behavior. Temperature-dependent Hall data exhibits important consequences. The
ordinary Hall coefficient changes sign near T$_{SR}$ indicating the change in
majority carriers. In a similar manner, the magnetoresistance (MR) data shows
significantly large negative MR near T$_{SR}$ and becomes positive below T$_Q$.
The observations of anomaly in the resistivity, sign-change of the ordinary
Hall coefficient and maximum negative MR near T$_{SR}$, together suggest a
possible Fermi surface reconstruction associated with the spin reorientation
transition. Furthermore, analysis of the Hall data reveals a significant
anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) from $\sim 123 \Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (at T
$\approx$ 5 K) to the maximum value of $\sim 366 \Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ near
T$_{SR}$. While the low-temperature part may originate due to the intrinsic KL
mechanism, our analysis indicates that the temperature-dependent AHC is
primarily appearing due to the side-jump mechanism as a result of the spin-flip
electron-magnon scattering. Our study demonstrates an interplay between
magnetism and band topology and its consequence on electron transport in
Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$.

<h3>Linking stability with molecular geometries of perovskites and  lanthanide richness using machine learning methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07441" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07441</a>

Oxide perovskite materials of type ABO3 have a wide range of technological
applications, such as catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells and as
light-absorbing materials in solar photovoltaics. These materials often exhibit
differential structural and electrostatic properties through lanthanide or
non-lanthanide derived A- and B- sites. Although, experimental and/or
computational verification of these differences are often difficult. In this
paper, we thus take a data-driven approach. Specifically, we run three analysis
using the dataset Li, Jacobs, and Morgan [2018a] applying advanced machine
learning tools to perform nonparametric regressions and also to produce data
visualizations using latent factor analysis (LFA) and principal component
analysis (PCA). We also implement a nonparametric feature screening step while
performing our high dimensional regression analysis, ensuring robustness in our
results

<h3>Landau quantization near generalized van Hove singularities: magnetic  breakdown and orbit networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07447</a>
<br>
<i>V. A. Zakharov, A. Mert Bozkurt, A. R. Akhmerov, D. O. Oriekhov</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theory of magnetic breakdown (MB) near high-order saddle points
in the dispersions of two-dimensional materials, where two or more
semiclassical cyclotron orbits approach each other. MB occurs due to quantum
tunneling between several trajectories, which leads to non-trivial scattering
amplitudes and phases. We show that for any saddle point this problem can be
solved by mapping it to a scattering problem in a 1D tight-binding chain.
Moreover, the occurrence of magnetic breakdown on the edges of the Brillouin
zone facilitates the delocalization of the bulk Landau level states and the
formation of 2D orbit networks. These extended network states compose
dispersive mini-bands with finite energy broadening. This effect can be
observed in transport experiments as a strong enhancement of the longitudinal
bulk conductance in a quantum Hall bar. In addition, it may be probed in STM
experiments by visualizing bulk current patterns.

<h3>From valence fluctuations to long-range magnetic order in  EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ single crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07472</a>
<br>
<i>Marius Peters, Kristin Kliemt, Bernd Wolf, Michael Lang, Cornelius Krellner</i>
<br>
<br>
EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ is a valence-fluctuating system undergoing a
temperature-induced valence crossover at $T'_V\approx160\,$K. We present the
successful single crystal growth using the Czochralski method for the
substitution series EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$, with substitution levels
$x\leq 0.15$. A careful determination of the germanium content revealed that
only half of the nominal concentration is build into the crystal structure.
From thermodynamic measurements it is established that $T'_V$ is strongly
suppressed for small substitution levels and antiferromagnetic order from
stable divalent europium emerges for $x\approx0.10$. The valence transition is
accompanied by a pronounced change of the a-lattice parameter of order 1.8%. In
the antiferromagnetically ordered state below $T_N = 47$ K, we find sizeable
magnetic anisotropy with an easy plane perpendicular to the crystallographic c
direction. An entropy analysis revealed that no valence fluctuations are
present for the magnetically ordered materials. Combining the obtained
thermodynamic and structural data, we construct a concentration-temperature
phase diagram demonstrating a rather abrupt change from valence fluctuating to
magnetically ordered state in EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$.

<h3>Tuning microwave losses in superconducting resonators</h3>

Performance of superconducting resonators, particularly cavities for particle
accelerators and micro cavities and thin film resonators for quantum
computations and photon detectors has been improved substantially by recent
materials treatments and technological advances. As a result, the niobium
cavities have reached the quality factors $Q\sim 10^{11}$ at 1-2 GHz and 1.5 K
and the breakdown radio-frequency (rf) fields $H$ close to the dc superheating
field of the Meissner state. These advances raise the question whether the
state-of-the-art cavities are close to the fundamental limits, what these
limits actually are, and to what extent the $Q$ and $H$ limits can be pushed by
the materials nano structuring and impurity management. These issues are also
relevant to many applications using high-Q thin film resonators, including
single-photon detectors and quantum circuits. This topical review outlines
basic physical mechanisms of the rf nonlinear surface impedance controlled by
quasiparticles, dielectric losses and trapped vortices, as well as the dynamic
field limit of the Meissner state. Sections cover ways of engineering an
optimum quasiparticle density of states and superfluid density to reduce rf
losses and kinetic inductance by pairbreaking mechanisms related to magnetic
impurities, rf currents, and proximity-coupled metallic layers at the surface.
A section focuses on mechanisms of residual surface resistance which dominates
rf losses at ultra low temperatures. Microwave losses of trapped vortices and
their reduction by optimizing the concentration of impurities and pinning
potential are also discussed.

<h3>Metastable defect phase diagrams as a tool to describe chemically driven  defect formation: Application to planar defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07504" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07504</a>

Thermodynamic bulk phase diagrams have become the roadmap used by researchers
to identify alloy compositions and process conditions that result in novel
materials with tailored microstructures. Recent experimental studies show that
changes in the alloy composition can drive not only transitions in the bulk
phases present in a material, but also in the concentration and type of defects
they contain. Defect phase diagrams in combination with density functional
theory provide a natural route to study these chemically driven defects. Our
results show, however, that direct application of thermodynamic approaches can
fail to reproduce the experimentally observed defect formation. Therefore, we
extend the concept to metastable defect phase diagrams to account for kinetic
limitations that prevent the system from reaching equilibrium. We successfully
applied this concept to explain the formation of large concentrations of planar
defects in supersaturated Fe-Nb solid solutions and to identify in a joint
study with experiments conditions in Mg-Al-Ca alloys for defect phase
occurrence. The concept offers new avenues for designing materials with
tailored defect structures.

<h3>An asynchronous parallel high-throughput model calibration framework for  crystal plasticity finite element constitutive models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07542</a>

Crystal plasticity finite element model (CPFEM) is a powerful numerical
simulation in the integrated computational materials engineering (ICME)
toolboxes that relates microstructures to homogenized materials properties and
establishes the structure-property linkages in computational materials science.
However, to establish the predictive capability, one needs to calibrate the
underlying constitutive model, verify the solution and validate the model
prediction against experimental data. Bayesian optimization (BO) has stood out
as a gradient-free efficient global optimization algorithm that is capable of
calibrating constitutive models for CPFEM. In this paper, we apply a recently
developed asynchronous parallel constrained BO algorithm to calibrate
phenomenological constitutive models for stainless steel 304L, Tantalum, and
Cantor high-entropy alloy.

The combined effect of electronic correlation and strong
spin-orbit-coupling(SOC) can give rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases.
Double perovskites provide a simple structure to study the spin-orbit-lattice
entangled states. In this thesis, focusing on the 5d osmate double perovskite
system, we conduct a combination of work including theoretical model

<h3>Magneto-thermal-switching properties of superconducting Nb</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07602" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07602</a>

<br>
<br>
Recently, thermal switching has been extensively studied because it is a key
component for thermal management in electronic devices. Here, we show a huge
magneto-thermal-switching ratio (MTSR) in pure Nb at temperatures lower than
its superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 9.2 K). The MTSR increases
with decreasing temperature, and MTSR of 650% was observed at T = 2.5 K under H
= 4.0 kOe. The thermal switching in superconductors with the huge MTSR will be
useful for improvement of the performance of low-temperature electronic
devices.

<h3>Mechanical properties of 2D metal-organic and covalent-organic  frameworks with non trivial topological band dispersion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07637" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07637</a>
<br>
<i>Priyadarshini Kapri, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino</i>
<br>
<br>
Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate mechanical properties
of a few 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks
(COFs) having Dirac and flat bands. These porous materials have become a
subject of great captivation because of their physical stability, distinctive
structural characteristics and large surface to volume ratio. The inherent
porosity of these frameworks gives rise to many fascinating and occasionally
surprising phenomena, which makes them potential candidates for technological
applications. For reliable usage of MOFs/COFs in functional nanodevice and
practical application, it is quite imperative to investigate their mechanical
properties. Thus, herein a particular attention is paid to study elastic
deformation of few 2D MOFs and COFs having non trivial topological band
dispersion in the regime with linear dependency of stress upon strain.
Specially, we consider different types of deformation and find all the
components of elastic tensor from the stress-strain and energy-strain curves.
These findings may provide useful information to fabricate the MOFs/COFs based
devices by lowering the number of experiments.

<h3>Creation of nano-skyrmion lattice in Fe/Ir(111) system using voltage  pulse</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic ultrathin films grown on heavy metal substrates often exhibit rich
spin structures due to the competition between various magnetic interactions
such as Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and higher-order
spin interactions. Here we employ spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy
to study magnetic nano-skyrmion phase in Fe monolayer grown on Ir(111)
substrate. Our observations show that the formation of nano-skyrmion lattice in
the Fe/Ir(111) system depends sensitively on the growth conditions and various
non-skyrmion spin states can be formed. Remarkably, the application of voltage
pulses between the tip and the sample can trigger a non-skyrmion to skyrmion
phase transition. The fact that nano-skyrmions can be created using voltage
pulse indicates that the balance between the competing magnetic interactions
can be affected by an external electric field, which is highly useful to design
skyrmion-based spintronic devices with low energy consumption.

<h3>Interface Response Functions for multicomponent alloy solidification- An  application to additive manufacturing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07663" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07663</a>
<br>
<i>V.S. Hariharan, B.S.Murty, Gandham Phanikumar</i>
<br>
<br>
The near-rapid solidification conditions during additive manufacturing can
lead to selection of non-equilibrium phases. Sharp interface models via
interface response functions have been used earlier to explain the
microstructure selection under such solidification conditions. However, most of
the sharp interface models assume linear superposition of contributions of
alloying elements without considering the non-linearity associated with the
phase diagram. In this report, both planar and dendritic Calphad coupled sharp
interface models have been implemented and used to explain the
growth-controlled phase selection observed at high solidification velocities
relevant to additive manufacturing. The implemented model predicted the
growth-controlled phase selection in multicomponent alloys, which the other
models with linear phase diagram could not. These models are calculated for
steels and a Nickel-based superalloy and the results are compared with
experimental observations.

Energy dissipation is of fundamental interest and crucial importance in
quantum systems. However, whether energy dissipation can emerge inside
topological systems remains a question, especially when charge transport is
topologically protected and quantized. As a hallmark, we propose a microscopic
picture that illustrates energy dissipation in the quantum Hall (QH) plateau
regime of graphene. Despite the quantization of Hall, longitudinal, and
two-probe resistances (dubbed as the quantum limit), we find that the energy
dissipation emerges in the form of Joule heat. By analyzing the energy
distribution of electrons, it is found that electrons can evolve between
equilibrium and non-equilibrium without inducing extra two-probe resistance.
The relaxation of non-equilibrium electrons results in the dissipation of
energy along the QH edge states. Eventually, we suggest probing the phenomenon
by measuring local temperature increases in experiments and reconsidering the
dissipation typically ignored in realistic topological circuits.

We demonstrate that topology of gapped boundaries in a one-dimensional
superconducting system can be characterized by level crossings at Fermi energy
while the periodic lattice is smoothly deformed into one with open boundaries.
The crossing, which in a D class system is solely protected by the conservation
of fermion number parity, signals a switch in ground-state fermion parity. The
model we consider involves two coupled Kitaev chains. Tuning the coupling
strength could drive the system across a boundary phase transition that
separates two phases with different fermion parity. To establish the
correspondence between bulk and the boundary topology, we identify the number
of Fermi-level crossings as a bulk invariant that can be obtained from bulk
spectrum. With inversion symmetry enforced, the difference of ground-state
inversion eigenvalues between periodic and anti-periodic system could also
serve as a topological invariant, from which the number of level crossings can
be inferred. In the end, we build up a two-dimensional model and demonstrate
that the bulk quantum number obtained for the one-dimensional system could be
directly applied to determine the higher-order topology with or without
inversion symmetry.

The superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent
transport has attracted considerable attention in recent years, both for its
intriguing physics and for its potential applications in superconducting
circuits. This study shows that planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on
type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM) MoTe2 can exhibit a prominent SDE due to the
emergence of asymmetric Josephson effect (AJE) in perpendicular magnetic
fields. As a result of the AJE, the critical supercurrents Ic are very
asymmetrical regarding the current direction [/Delta]Ic. [/Delta]Ic can also be
modulated effectively by an external magnetic field. As a result of the
inversion symmetry breaking in WSM, all these results are in agreement with
theoretically predicted intrinsic AJEs. The field-tunable AJE allows us to
demonstrate the rectification of supercurrent in such MoTe2 JJs, with
rectification efficiency up to 17%, paving the way for their application in
superconducting electronics.

Formulating an appropriate elasto-viscoplastic constitutive equation is
challenging, especially for a model describing pre-yielding solid and
post-yielding liquid behaviours. Oldroyds 1946 formulation was one of the first
models explaining it, however, assumptions of a simple linear elastic and
quasi-static deformation before yielding made his model idealistic. At the same
time, the quasi-static pre-yielding deformation assumption open-up the
possibility for pre-yielding viscous and plastic deformation in the absence of
quasi-static conditions. Most early models followed Oldroyds pre-yielding
linear elastic assumption. Here, we discuss the structural parameters based
thixotropic non-linear elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model valid for
reversible and irreversible thixotropic materials. In this work, we have
considered non-linear elastic and plastic behaviours before yielding. Despite
being a simple algebraic equation, our model explains both the viscosity
plateau at low shear rates and the diverging zero shear rate viscosity, using
the same parameters but different shear histories. Our model also predicts
experimentally observable transient and steady-state shear banding.
Furthermore, our model effectively predicts waiting-time-dependent stress
overshoot during startup flow, stress hysteresis in shear ramps, sudden
stepdown shear rate test results, and viscosity bifurcation phenomena. At the
steady state, it reduces to either Bingham, Herschel Bulkley type, or Newtonian
fluids model, depending on shear histories. Our model requires only four and
five for the irreversible and reversible model, respectively, compared to six
or seven parameters required by the existing model. With fewer parameters, our
model favourably predicts recent experimental results. The current framework
has the potential to provide a possible physical interpretation of the Bingham
model.

<br>
<br>
Topological data analysis based on persistent homology has been applied to
the molecular dynamics simulation for the fast ion-conducting phase
($\alpha$-phase) of AgI, to show its effectiveness on the ion-migration
mechanism analysis.Time-averaged persistence diagrams of $\alpha$-AgI, which
quantitatively records the shape and size of the ring structures in the given
atomic configurations, clearly showed the emergence of the four-membered rings
formed by two Ag and two I ions at high temperatures. They were identified as
common structures during the Ag ion migration. The averaged potential energy
change due to the deformation of four-membered ring during Ag migration agrees
well with the activation energy calculated from the conductivity Arrhenius
plot. The concerted motion of two Ag ions via the four-membered ring was also
successfully extracted from molecular dynamics simulations by our approach,
providing the new insight into the specific mechanism of the concerted motion.

Time-crystals are nonequilibrium many-body phases in which the state of the
system dynamically approaches a limit cycle. While these phases are recently in
the focus of intensive research, it is still far from clear whether they can
host quantum correlations. In fact, mostly classical correlations have been
observed so far and time-crystals appear to be effectively classical
high-entropy phases. Here, we consider the nonequilibrium behavior of an open
quantum light-matter system, realizable in current experiments, which maps onto
a paradigmatic time-crystal model after an adiabatic elimination of the light
field. The system displays a bistable regime, with coexistent time-crystal and
stationary phases, terminating at a tricritical point from which a second-order
phase transition line departs. While light and matter are uncorrelated in the
stationary phase, the time-crystal phase features bipartite correlations, both
of quantum and classical nature. Our work unveils that time-crystal phases in
collective open quantum systems can sustain quantum correlations, including
entanglement, and are thus more than effectively classical many-body phases.

<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of the striking sheet-like multicellular
choanoflagellate species $Choanoeca~flexa$ that dynamically interconverts
between two hemispherical forms of opposite orientation raises fundamental
questions in cell and evolutionary biology, as choanoflagellates are the
closest living relatives of animals. It similarly motivates questions in fluid
and solid mechanics concerning the differential swimming speeds in the two
states and the mechanism of curvature inversion triggered by changes in the
geometry of microvilli emanating from each cell. Here we develop fluid
dynamical and mechanical models to address these observations and show that
they capture the main features of the swimming, feeding, and inversion of
$C.~flexa$ colonies.

<h3>Nature of the order parameter of glass</h3>

<br>
<i>Koun Shirai</i>
<br>
<br>
In glass physics, order parameters have long been used in the thermodynamic
description of glasses, but the nature is not yet clear. The difficulty is how
to find order in disordered systems. The usual treatment of glass as an
exceptional case causes serious internal inconsistencies in thermodynamics. The
issue turns out to be ascribed to a fundamental problem of defining state
variables in thermodynamics. This study provides a coherent understanding of
the nature of order parameters for glasses and crystals, starting from the
fundamental issue of defining state variables in thermodynamics. The state
variable is defined as the time-averaged value of a dynamical variable under
the constraint conditions, provided that the time average converges to a unique
value. This property is called time invariance. It gives the same value at any
time it is measured once an equilibrium is established. From this definition,
it is deduced that the state variables of a solid are the time-averaged
positions of all atoms constituting the solid, regardless of periodicity. The
general properties of order parameters are fully compatible with the time
invariance of state variables. For glass, equilibrium positions are state
variables and order parameters too. Because equilibrium positions are order
parameters, any property determined by equilibrium positions can also be an
order parameter. This explains why many quantities can be used for order
parameters. Symmetry introduces redundancy among the averaged positions of the
atoms, reducing the number of independent state variables. The often-claimed
association of order to periodicity lacks generality as explained by abundant
examples of well-ordered material, such as DNA. Order in thermodynamics means
the time invariance.

<h3>Higher-order tensor renormalization group study of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising  model on a square lattice</h3>

<i>Kota Yoshiyama, Koji Hukushima</i>
<br>
<br>
Phase transitions of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on a square lattice are
studied using the higher-order tensor renormalization group(HOTRG) method. This
system involves a competition between the ferromagnetic interaction $J_1$ and
antiferromagnetic interaction $J_2$. Furthermore, weak first-order and
second-order transitions are observed near the ratio $g=J_2/|J_1|=1/2$. Our
results (based on HOTRG calculations for significantly larger sizes) indicate
that the region of the first-order transition is marginally narrower than that
in previous studies. Moreover, the universality class of the second-order
transition connected to the transition line is not necessarily fully consistent
with the Ashkin--Teller class considered earlier.

<i>Miguel Alvarado, Pablo Burset, Alfredo Levy Yeyati</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments have demonstrated the possibility to design highly
controllable junctions on magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, enabling the
test of its superconducting transport properties. We show that the presence of
chiral pairing in such devices manifests in the appearance of an anomalous
Josephson effect ($\phi_0$ behavior) even in the case of symmetric junctions
and without requiring any magnetic materials or fields. Such behavior arises
from the combination of chiral pairing and nontrivial topology of the twisted
bilayer graphene band structure that can effectively break inversion symmetry.
Moreover, we show that the $\phi_0$ effect could be experimentally enhanced and
controlled by electrostatic tuning of the junction transmission properties.

<h3>Habit plane determination from reconstructed parent phase orientation  maps</h3>

This study details the development and validation of a new algorithm that
determines the dominant habit plane of a transformed child phase from
orientation maps of a single planar cross-section. The method describes the
habit plane in terms of its five-parameter grain boundary character and couples
it to the specific orientation relationship of the identified orientation
variant. The symmetry operations associated with the specific orientation
relationship of the variants are applied to transform habit plane traces as
determined in the specimen-fixed reference frame into the parent or child
reference frame, allowing for the fitting of the habit plane. Our algorithm
stands out by its robustness, computational efficiency, automation and ability
to operate on fully transformed microstructures. Four automated methods for
habit plane trace determination are proposed and compared. Detailed sensitivity
analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm is exceptionally robust against
poor accuracy in the measured traces and distortions in the orientation map,
but more sensitive to inaccuracies propagated from parent grain reconstruction.
Validation on a synthetic microstructure with a known habit plane and returned
consistent results when applied to high and low carbon steels with different
prior austenite grain sizes and orientation map resolutions. The habit planes
were not significantly affected by the austenite grain sizes. The habit plane
of the steel with 0.35 wt.% C was close to (111){\gamma} whereas the habit
plane of steel with 0.71 wt.% C was closer to (575){\gamma}, in close agreement
with previous work using two-surface stereological analysis and transmission
electron microscopy-based trace analysis.

<h3>Linked cluster expansion on trees</h3>

<br>
<br>
The linked cluster expansion has been shown to be highly efficient in
calculating equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of a variety of 1D and 2D
classical and quantum lattice models. In this article, we extend the linked
cluster method to the Cayley tree and its boundaryless cousin the Bethe
lattice. We aim to (a) develop the linked cluster expansion for these lattices,
a novel application, and (b) to further understand the surprising convergence
efficiency of the linked cluster method, as well as its limitations. We obtain
several key results. First, we show that for nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians of a
specific form, all finite treelike clusters can be mapped to one dimensional
finite chains. We then show that the qualitative distinction between the Cayley
tree and Bethe lattice appears due to differing lattice constants that is a
result of the Bethe lattice being boundaryless. We use these results to obtain
the explicit closed-form formula for the zero-field susceptibility for the
entire disordered phase up to the critical point for Bethe lattices of
arbitrary degree; remarkably, only 1D chainlike clusters contribute. We also
obtain the exact zero field partition function for the Ising model on both
trees with only the two smallest clusters, similar to the 1D chain. Finally,
these results achieve a direct comparison between an infinite lattice with a
nonnegligible boundary and one without any boundary, allowing us to show that
the linked cluster expansion eliminates boundary terms at each order of the
expansion, answering the question about its surprising convergence efficiency.
We conclude with some ramifications of these results, and possible
generalizations and applications.

<h3>Flattening conduction and valence bands for interlayer excitons in a  moiré MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayer</h3>

<br>
<br>
We explore the flatness of conduction and valence bands of interlayer
excitons in MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterobilayers, tuned by interlayer
twist angle, pressure, and external electric field. We employ an efficient
continuum model where the moir\'e pattern from lattice mismatch and/or twisting
is represented by an equivalent mesoscopic periodic potential. We demonstrate
that the mismatch moir\'e potential is too weak to produce significant
flattening. Moreover, we draw attention to the fact that the quasi-particle
effective masses around the $\Gamma$-point and the band flattening are
\textit{reduced} with twisting. As an alternative approach, we show (i) that
reducing the interlayer distance by uniform vertical pressure can significantly
increase the effective mass of the moir\'e hole, and (ii) that the moir\'e
depth and its band flattening effects are strongly enhanced by accessible
electric gating fields perpendicular to the heterobilayer, with resulting
electron and hole effective masses increased by more than an order of magnitude
leading to record-flat bands. These findings impose boundaries on the commonly
generalized benefits of moir\'e twistronics, while also revealing alternate
feasible routes to achieve truly flat electron and hole bands to carry us to
strongly correlated excitonic phenomena on demand.

<br>
<br>
In this study, the structure and composition of the native oxide forming on
the basal plane (0001) of Mg-2Al-0.1Ca is investigated by a correlative
approach, combining scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom
probe tomography (APT). Atom probe specimens were prepared conventionally in a
Ga focused ion beam (FIB) as well as a Xe plasma FIB in a cryogenic setup and
subsequently cleaned in the atom probe to remove surface contamination before
oxidation. While thermal energy input from the laser and longer atmospheric
exposure time increased the measured hydrogen content in the specimen's apex
region, cryo preparation revealed, that the hydrogen uptake in magnesium is
independent of the employment of conventional or cryogenic FIB preparation. TEM
measurements demonstrated the growth of a (111) MgO oxide layer with 3-4 nm
thickness on the basal (0001) plane of the Mg atom probe specimen. APT data
further revealed the formation of an aluminum-rich region between bulk Mg and
the native oxide. The aluminum enrichment of up to ~20 at.% at the interface is
consistent with an inward growth of the oxide scale.

<h3>Pressure study on the interplay between magnetic order and  valence-change crossover in EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present results of the magnetic susceptibility on high-quality single
crystals of EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ for Ge concentrations 0 $\leq x
\leq$ 0.105 performed under varying hydrostatic (He-gas) pressure 0 $\leq p
\leq$ 0.5 GPa. The work extends on recent studies at ambient pressure
demonstrating the drastic change in the magnetic response from
valence-change-crossover behavior for $x$ = 0 and 0.058, to long-range
antiferromagnetic (afm) order below $T_{\text{N}}$ = 47 K for $x$ = 0.105. The
valence-change-crossover temperature $T'_{\text{V}}$ shows an extraordinarily
strong pressure dependence of d$T'_{\text{V}}$/d$p$ = +(80 $\pm$ 10) K/GPa. In
contrast, a very small pressure dependence of d$T_{\text{N}}$/d$p \leq$ +(1
$\pm$ 0.5) K/GPa is found for the afm order upon pressurizing the $x$ = 0.105
crystal from $p$ = 0 to 0.05 GPa. Remarkably, by further increasing the
pressure to 0.1 GPa, a drastic change in the ground state from afm order to
valence-change-crossover behavior is observed. Estimates of the electronic
entropy, derived from analyzing susceptibility data at varying pressures,
indicate that the boundary between afm order and valence-change crossover
represents a first-order phase transition. Our results suggest a particular
type of second-order critical endpoint of the first-order transition for $x$ =
0.105 at $p_{\text{cr}} \approx$ 0.06 GPa and $T_{\text{cr}} \approx$ 45 K
where intriguing strong-coupling effects between fluctuating charge-, spin- and
lattice degrees of freedom can be expected.

SrTiO$_3$ has been extensively investigated owing to its abundant degrees of
freedom for modulation. However, the microscopic mechanism of thermal transport
especially the relationship between phonon scattering and lattice distortion
during the phase transition are missing and unclear. Based on deep-potential
molecular dynamics and self-consistent \textit{ab initio} lattice dynamics, we
explore the lattice anharmonicity-induced tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition
and explain this anomalous behavior during the phase transition. Our results
indicate the significant role of the renormalization of third-order interatomic
force constants to second-order terms. Our work provides a robust framework for
evaluating the thermal transport properties during structural transformation,
benefitting the future design of promising thermal and phononic materials and
devices.

<br>
<br>
Recently gate-mediated supercurrent suppression in superconducting
nano-bridges has been reported in many experiments. This could be either a
direct or an indirect gate effect. The microscopic understanding of this
observation is not clear till now. Using the quasiclassical Green's function
method, we show that a small concentration of magnetic impurities at the
surface of the bridges can significantly help to suppress superconductivity and
hence the supercurrent inside the systems while applying a gate field. This is
because the gate field can enhance the depairing through the exchange
interaction between the magnetic impurities at the surface and the
superconductor. We also obtain a \emph{symmetric} suppression of the
supercurrent with respect to the gate field, a signature of a direct gate
effect. Future experiments can verify our predictions by modifying the surface
with magnetic impurities.

<br>
<br>
We observe enhanced three-fold symmetric helicity-dependent topological
photocurrents using time-domain THz spectroscopy in epitaxially-grown Bi2Se3
with reduced crystallographic twinning. It is established how twinned crystal
domains introduce competing responses that obscure inherent nonlinear optical
responses of the intrinsic crystal structure. Minimizing this defect reveals
strong nonlinear optical response currents whose magnitude and direction depend
on the alignment of the excitation to the crystal axes and follow the
three-fold rotational symmetry of the crystal structure. Notably, the azimuthal
dependence of the photoresponse persists for helical excitations - an
unprecedented result we attribute to the photon drag effect, where the photon
momentum acts as an applied in-plane field that is stationary in the laboratory
frame. Additionally, the sign of the resultant THz signal inverts when the
helicity of incident light is switched from right to left circularly polarized,
indicating a reversal of the photocurrent. Our results demonstrate that even
extended domain defects can obscure intrinsic physical processes, making the
study of single domain thin films crucial to the observation of phenomena that
couple topological order and crystal symmetries.

<h3>Arrhenius temperature dependence of the crystallization time of deeply  supercooled liquids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Usually, supercooled liquids and glasses are thermodynamically unstable
against crystallization. Classical nucleation theory (CNT) has been used to
describe the crystallization dynamics of supercooled liquids. However, recent
studies on overcompressed hard spheres show that their crystallization dynamics
are intermittent and mediated by avalanche-like rearrangements of particles,
which largely differ from the CNT. These observations suggest that the
crystallization times of deeply supercooled liquids or glasses cannot be
described by the CNT, but this point has not yet been studied in detail. In
this paper, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the crystallization
dynamics of soft spheres just after an instantaneous quench. We show that
although the equilibrium relaxation time increases in a super-Arrhenius manner
with decreasing temperature, the crystallization time shows an Arrhenius
temperature dependence at very low temperatures. This is contrary to the
conventional formula based on the CNT. Furthermore, the estimated energy
barrier for the crystallization is surprisingly small compared to that for the
equilibrium dynamics. By comparing the crystallization and aging dynamics
quantitatively, we show that a coupling between aging and crystallization is
the key for understanding the rapid crystallization of deeply supercooled
liquids or glasses.

We analyze the renormalization-group (RG) flows of two effective Lagrangians,
one for measurement induced transitions of monitored quantum systems and one
for entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. These Lagrangians,
previously proposed on grounds of replica symmetry, are derived in a controlled
regime for an illustrative family of tensor networks. They have different forms
in the two cases, and involve distinct replica limits. The perturbative RG is
controlled by working close to a critical dimensionality, ${d_c=6}$ for
measurements and ${d_c=10}$ for random tensors, where interactions become
marginal. The resulting RG flows are surprising in several ways. They indicate
that in high dimensions $d>d_c$ there are at least two (stable) universality
classes for each kind of transition, separated by a nontrivial tricritical
point. In each case one of the two stable fixed points is Gaussian, while the
other is nonperturbative. In lower dimensions, $d<d_c$, the flow always runs to
the nonperturbative regime. This picture clarifies the "mean-field theory" of
these problems, including the phase diagram of all-to-all quantum circuits. It
suggests a way of reconciling exact results on tree tensor networks with field
theory. Most surprisingly, the perturbation theory for the random tensor
network (which also applies to a version of the measurement transition with
"forced" measurements) formally possesses a dimensional reduction property
analogous to that of the random-field Ising model. When only the leading
interactions are retained, perturbative calculations in $d$ dimensions reduce
to those in a simple scalar field theory in ${d-4}$ dimensions. We show that
this holds to all orders by writing the action in a superspace formulation.

It was recently discovered that a crystalline many-body state can exist in
the phase space of a closed dynamical system. Phase space crystal can be
anomalous Chern insulator that supports chiral topological transport without
breaking physical time-reversal symmetry [L. Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 105,
094301 (2022)]. In this work, we further study the effects of open dissipative
environment with thermal noise, and identify the existence condition of
classical phase space crystals in realistic scenarios. By defining a crystal
order parameter, we plot the phase diagram in the parameter space of
dissipation rate, interaction and temperature. Our present work paves the way
to realise phase space crystals and explore anomalous chiral transport in
experiments.

A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the
simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using
both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the
capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its
plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical
processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its
functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case
of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to
have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and
present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary
electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to
understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At
higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear
regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the
build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass
diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the
Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime
(intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially
due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident.
In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass
are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time.

<h3>Nature of Subdiffusion Crossover in Molecular Glass-Formers</h3>

In various polymeric/molecular glass-formers, crossover from a non-Gaussian
to Gaussian subdiffusion has been observed ubiquitously. We have developed a
framework which generalizes the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model to
incorporate non-Gaussian features by introducing a jump kernel. We illustrate
that the non-Gaussian fBm (nGfBm) model accurately characterizes the
subdiffusion crossover. From the solutions of the nGfBm model, we acquire
insights about the nature of van-Hove self-correlation in non-Gaussian
subdiffusive regime, which are found to exhibit exponential tails, providing
first such experimental evidence in molecular glass-formers. The results of the
model are substantiated using incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering on
glass-forming deep eutectic solvents.

<h3>Photo-to-heat conversion of broadband metamaterial absorbers based on  TiN nanoparticles under laser and solar illumination</h3>

We theoretically investigate photothermal heating of ultra-flexible
metamaterials, which are obtained by randomly mixing TiN nanoparticles in
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Due to the plasmonic properties of TiN
nanoparticles, incident light is perfectly absorbed in a broadband range
(300-3000 nm) to generate heat within these metamaterials. Under irradiation of
an 808 nm near-infrared laser with different intensities, our predicted
temperature rises as a function of time agree well with recent experimental
data. For a given laser intensity, the temperature rise varies
non-monotonically with concentration of TiN nanoparticles because the
enhancement of thermal conductivity and absorbed energy as adding plasmonic
nanostructures leads to opposite effects on the heating process. When the model
is extended to solar heating, photothermal behaviors are qualitatively similar
but the temperature increase is less than 13 $K$. Our studies would provide
good guidance for future experimental studies on the photo-to-heat conversion
of broadband perfect absorbers.

It is now well established theoretically and experimentally that a moir\'e
pattern, due to a rotation of two atomic layers with respect to each other,
creates low-energy flat bands. First discovered in twisted bilayer graphene,
these new electronic states are at the origin of strong electronic correlations
and even of unconventional superconductivity. Twisted bilayers (tb) of
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) also exhibit flat bands around their
semiconductor gap at small rotation angles. In this paper, we present a DFT
study to analyze the effect of the atomic relaxation on the low-energy bands of
tb-MoS2 with a rotation angle of 5.09 degrees. We show that in-plane atomic
relaxation is not essential here, while out-of-plane relaxation dominates the
electronic structure. We propose a simple and efficient atomic model to predict
this relaxation.

Phonon anharmonicity plays a crucial role in determining the stability and
vibrational properties of high-pressure hydrides. Furthermore, strong
anharmonicity can render phonon quasiparticle picture obsolete. In this work,
we show the effects of non-Lorentzian phonon lineshapes on the
superconductivity of high-pressure solid hydrogen. We calculate the
superconducting critical temperature T$_\mathrm{C}$ \emph{ab initio}
considering the full anharmonic lineshape of the phonon spectral function and
show that it substantially enhances T$_\mathrm{C}$. Despite previous anharmonic
calculations estimating a weak anharmonicity in atomic hydrogen, considering
the full spectral function enhances the critical temperature by 100 K, pushing
it above 400 K. Our calculations also reveal that superconductivity emerges in
hydrogen in the Cmca-12 molecular phase VI at pressures between 450 and 500
GPa.

The phenomenon of s-wave spin triplet Cooper pairs induced in ferromagnetic
metals has been researched now for more than a decade, and its main aspects are
well understood. Crucial in converting s-wave singlet pairs in the
superconductor to s-wave triplets in the ferromagnet is the engineering of
well-defined magnetic inhomogeneity (the 'generator') at the interface with the
superconductor. Vertical layer stacks are typically used as such, where two
separate thin ferromagnetic layers with homogeneous but non-collinear
magnetizations, provide the inhomogeneity. Alternatively, magnetic textures,
like ferromagnetic domain walls and vortices, are possible triplet generators,
although they are far less studied. In this paper we review our experiments on
lateral disk-shaped Josephson junctions where a ferromagnetic bottom layer
provides a weak link with a vortex magnetization imposed by the shape of the
disk. We present three different junction configurations, exhibiting their own
generator mechanism. In the first, we utilize the non-collinearity with a
second ferromagnetic layer to produce the triplet correlations. The second
configuration consists of only the bottom ferromagnet and the superconducting
contacts; it relies on the vortex magnetization itself to generate the
spin-polarized supercurrents. In the third case we exploit an intrinsic
generator by combining a conventional superconductor (NbTi) and a half-metallic
ferromagnetic oxide (La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$). We find strong supercurrents
in all cases. A particularly interesting finding is that the supercurrents are
strongly confined at the rims of the device, independent of the generating
mechanism, but directly related to their triplet nature. What causes these rim
currents remains an open question.

Graphite is one of the most chemically inert materials. Its elementary
constituent, monolayer graphene, is generally expected to inherit most of the
parent material's properties including chemical inertness. Here we show that,
unlike graphite, defect-free monolayer graphene exhibits a strong activity with
respect to splitting molecular hydrogen, which is comparable to that of
metallic and other known catalysts for this reaction. We attribute the
unexpected catalytic activity to surface corrugations (nanoscale ripples), a
conclusion supported by theory. Nanoripples are likely to play a role in other
chemical reactions involving graphene and, because nanorippling is inherent to
atomically thin crystals, can be important for two dimensional materials in
general.

The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as an interesting
object in both classical and quantum systems for probing the spatial spread and
temporal growth of initially local perturbations in spatially extended chaotic
systems. Here, we study the (classical) OTOC and its ``light-cone'' in the
nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, using extensive numerical
simulations. We also show that the linearized KS equation exhibits a
qualitatively similar OTOC and light-cone, which can be understood via a
saddle-point analysis of the linearly unstable modes. Given the deep connection
between the KS (deterministic) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (stochastic)
equations, we also explore the OTOC in the KPZ equation. More broadly, our work
unravels the intrinsic interplay between noise/instability, nonlinearity and
dissipation in partial differential equations (deterministic or stochastic)
through the lens of OTOC.

As spin caloritronic measurements become increasingly common techniques for
characterizing material properties, it is important to quantify potentially
confounding effects. We report measurements of the Nernst-Ettingshausen
response from room temperature to 5 K in thin film wires of Pt and W, metals
commonly used as inverse spin Hall detectors in spin Seebeck characterization.
Johnson-Nyquist noise thermometry is used to assess the temperature change of
the metals with heater power at low temperatures, and the thermal path is
analyzed via finite-element modeling. The Nernst-Ettingshausen response of W is
found to be approximately temperature-independent, while the response of Pt
increases at low temperatures. These results are discussed in the context of
theoretical expectations and the possible role of magnetic impurities in Pt.

Reduced exciton mass, polarizability, and dielectric constant of the
surrounding medium are essential properties for semiconduction materials, and
they can be extracted recently from the magnetoexciton energies. However, the
acceptable accuracy of the previously suggested method requires very high
magnetic intensity. Therefore, in the present paper, we propose an alternative
method of extracting these material properties from recently available
experimental magnetoexciton s-state energies in monolayer transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The method is based on the high sensitivity of exciton
energies to the material parameters in the Rytova-Keldysh model. It allows us
to vary the considered material parameters to get the best fit of the
theoretical calculation to the experimental exciton energies for the $1s$,
$2s$, and $3s$ states. This procedure gives values of the exciton reduced mass
and 2D polarizability. Then, the experimental magnetoexciton spectra compared
to the theoretical calculation gives also the average dielectric constant.
Concrete applications are presented only for monolayers WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ from
the recently available experimental data. However, the presented approach is
universal and can be applied to other monolayer TMDCs. The mentioned fitting
procedure requires a fast and effective method of solving the Schr\"{o}dinger
of an exciton in monolayer TMDCs with a magnetic field. Therefore, we also
develop such a method in this study for highly accurate magnetoexciton
energies.

<h3>Higgs Condensates are Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases: II. $U(1)$  Gauge Theory and Superconductors</h3>

Classifying Higgs phases within the landscape of gapped and symmetry
preserving states of matter presents a conceptual challenge. We argue that
$U(1)$ Higgs phases are symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and we
derive their topological response theory and boundary anomaly -- applicable to
superconductors treated with dynamical electromagnetic field. This generalizes
the discussion of discrete gauge theories by Verresen et al., arXiv:2211.01376.
We show that a Higgs phase in $d$ spatial dimensions is in a non-trivial SPT
class protected by a global $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the Higgs field,
and a $d-2$ form $U(1)$ magnetic symmetry, associated with the absence of
magnetic monopoles. In $d=2$, this gives an SPT with a mixed Hall response
between conventional symmetries, whereas in $d=3$ we obtain a novel SPT
protected by a 0-form and 1-form symmetry whose 2+1d boundary anomaly is
satisfied by a superfluid. The signature properties of superconductors -- Higgs
phases for electromagnetism -- can be reproduced from this SPT response. For
instance, the Josephson effect directly arises from the aforementioned boundary
superfluid. In addition to this minimalist approach being complementary to
Landau-Ginzburg theory, its non-perturbative nature is useful in situations
where fluctuations are significant. We substantiate this by predicting the
stability of the Josephson effect upon introducing monopoles in $U(1)$ lattice
gauge theory, where tuning from the charge-1 Higgs phase to the confined phase
leads to a quantum critical point in the junction. Furthermore, this
perspective reveals unexpected connections, such as how persistent currents at
the surface of a superconductor arise from generalized Thouless pumps. We also
treat generalizations to partial-Higgs phases, including "2e" condensates in
electronic superconductors, corresponding to symmetry-enriched topological
orders.
