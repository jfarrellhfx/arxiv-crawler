<h3>Nonadiabatic transition paths from quantum jump trajectories</h3>

We present a means of studying rare reactive pathways in open quantum systems
using Transition Path Theory and ensembles of quantum jump trajectories. This
approach allows for elucidation of reactive paths for dissipative, nonadiabatic
dynamics when the system is embedded in a Markovian environment. We detail the
dominant pathways and rates of thermally activated processes, as well as the
relaxation pathways and photoyields following vertical excitation in a minimal
model of a conical intersection. We find that the geometry of the conical
intersection affects the electronic character of the transition state, as
defined through a generalization of a committor function for a thermal barrier
crossing event. Similarly, the geometry changes the mechanism of relaxation
following a vertical excitation. Relaxation in models resulting from small
diabatic coupling proceed through pathways dominated by pure dephasing, while
those with large diabatic coupling proceed through pathways limited by
dissipation. The perspective introduced here for the nonadiabatic dynamics of
open quantum systems generalizes classical notions of reactive paths to
fundamentally quantum mechanical processes.

<h3>Effects of lattice dilution on the non-equilibrium phase transition in the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model</h3>

We investigate how site dilution, as would be introduced by immunization,
affects the properties of the active-to-absorbing non-equilibrium phase
transition in the paradigmatic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model on
regular cubic lattices. According to the Harris criterion, the critical
behavior of the SIR model, which is governed by the universal scaling exponents
of the dynamic isotropic percolation (DyIP) universality class, should remain
unaltered after introducing impurities. However, when the SIR reactions are
simulated for immobile agents on two- and three-dimensional lattices subject to
quenched disorder, we observe a wide crossover region characterized by varying
effective exponents. Only after a sufficient increase of the lattice sizes does
it becomes clear that the SIR system must transition from that crossover regime
before the effective critical exponents asymptotically assume the expected DyIP
values. We attribute the appearance of this exceedingly long crossover to small
disconnected clusters of susceptible sites which are apt to be generated when
the system is prepared with Poisson-distributed quenched disorder. Finally, we
demonstrate that this transient region becomes drastically diminished when we
enable diffusive agent mobility through short-range hopping.

<h3>Electrical Generation of Surface Phonon Polaritons</h3>

Efficient electrical generation of mid-infrared light is challenging because
of the dearth of materials with natural dipole-active electronic transitions in
this spectral region. One approach to solve this problem is through
quantum-engineering of the electron dispersion to create artificial
transitions, as in quantum cascade devices. In this work we propose an
alternative method to generate mid-infrared light, utilizing the coupling
between longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom due to the nonlocal
optical response of nanoscopic polar dielectric crystals. Polar crystals
support transverse sub-diffraction photonic modes in the mid-infrared. They
also support longitudinal phonons, which couple efficiently with electrical
currents through the Fr\"ohlich interaction. As we have shown in previous
theoretical and experimental works, these two degrees of freedom can hybridize
forming longitudinal-transverse polaritons. Here we theoretically demonstrate
that longitudinal-transverse polaritons can be efficiently generated by
electrical currents, leading to resonant narrowband photonic emission
spectrally tunable across the Reststrahlen region. This approach can therefore
be utilised to electrically generate far-field mid-infrared photons in the
absence of dipole-active electronic transitions, potentially underpinning a
novel generation of mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.
