<h3>Observability of cyclotron resonance in the hydrodynamic regime of  bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02231" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02231</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph R. Cruise, Alexander Seidel, Erik Henriksen, Giovanni Vignale</i>
<p>We offer theoretical predictions for the frequency of the resonant frequency
of transport for the hydrodynamic description of bilayer graphene, as well as
provide quantification for the relative strength of this signal throughout
phase space. Our calculations are based on classical fluid dynamics equations
derived from the Boltzmann equation for bilayer graphene in arXiv:1901.07039,
and suggest that while this resonance is accessible to current experimental
techniques, the same mechanism which causes the hydrodynamic resonance to
differ from the Fermi liquid value is responsible for a significant broadening
of the peak.

<h3>Heterogeneous Solvent Dissipation Coupled with Particle Rearrangement  and in Shear Thinning Non-Brownian Suspensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02756" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02756</a>

<i>Tomoharu Terayama, Akira Furukawa</i>
<p>Dense non-Brownian suspensions exhibit significant shear thinning, although a
comprehensive understanding of the full scope of this phenomenon remains
elusive. This study numerically reveals intimate heterogenous coupled dynamics
between many-body particle motions and solvent hydrodynamics in shear-thinning
non-Brownian suspensions. We demonstrate the spatially correlated viscous
dissipation and particle motions; they share the same characteristic length,
which decreases with increasing shear rate. We further show that, at lower
shear rates, significant particle density changes are induced against the
incompressibility of the solvent, suggesting the cooperative creation and
annihilation of gaps and flow channels. We discuss that hydrodynamic
interactions may substantially restrict particle rearrangements even in highly
dense suspensions, influencing the quantitative aspects of macroscopic
rheology.

<h3>Fluidization and anomalous density fluctuations in epithelial tissues  with pulsating activity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02981" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02981</a>
<br>
<i>Zhu-Qin Li, Qun-Li Lei, Yu-qiang Ma</i>
<p>Cells not only can have self-motility by crawling, but also are capable of
other types of active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this
work, by using the Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity
affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers.
We found that random cell pulsation can fluidize solid epithelial tissues,
resulting in a \emph{hyperuniform} fluid state, while pulsation synchronization
inhibits the fluidity, causes a reversed solidification. We prove this
solidification is BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic
heterogeneity arising from the creation of topological defects in the pulsating
phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge as
the pulsating period increases, resulting in an opposite \emph{giant} density
fluctuation. Our findings accord with recent experimental observations and can
be quantitatively explained by a proposed fluctuating hydrodynamic theory.

<h3>Electrical Conductance of Nanofluidic Systems subjected to Asymmetric  Concentrations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01678</a>
<br>
<i>Oren Lavi, Yoav Green</i>
<p>A nanochannel subjected to both a potential and concentration gradient has an
asymmetric current-voltage, I-V, response with three primary characteristics:
the Ohmic conductance, G, the current at zero voltage, I(v=0), and the voltage
at zero current, V(I=0). To date, there is no known self-consistent theory for
these characteristics subject to an arbitrary concentration gradient. Here, we
present simple expressions for each of these characteristics that have been
derived self-consistently. Our findings provide insights into the underlying
physics of nanofluidics systems used for water desalination and energy
harvesting.

<h3>Spontaneous nucleation and growth of GaN nanowires: Fundamental role of  crystal polarity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01755</a>
<br>
<i>Sergio Fernández-Garrido, Xiang Kong, Tobias Gotschke, Raffaella Calarco, Lutz Geelhaar, Achim Trampert, Oliver Brandt</i>
<p>We experimentally investigate whether crystal polarity affects the growth of
GaN nanowires in plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy and whether their
formation has to be induced by defects. For this purpose, we prepare smooth and
coherently strained AlN layers on 6H- SiC(0001) and SiC(000$\bar{1}$)
substrates to ensure a well-defined polarity and an absence of structural and
morphological defects. On N-polar AlN, a homogeneous and dense N-polar GaN
nanowire array forms, evidencing that GaN nanowires form spontaneously in the
absence of defects. On Al-polar AlN, we do not observe the formation of
Ga-polar GaN NWs. Instead, sparse N-polar GaN nanowires grow embedded in a
Ga-polar GaN layer. These N-polar GaN nanowires are shown to be accidental in
that the necessary polarity inversion is induced by the formation of Si$_{x}$N.
The present findings thus demonstrate that spontaneously formed GaN nanowires
are irrevocably N-polar. Due to the strong impact of the polarity on the
proper- ties of GaN-based devices, these results are not only essential to
understand the spontaneous formation of GaN nanowires but also of high
technological relevance.

<h3>Self-regulated radius of spontaneously formed GaN nanowires in molecular  beam epitaxy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01756" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01756</a>
<br>
<i>Sergio Fernández-Garrido, Vladimir M. Kaganer, Karl K. Sabelfeld, Tobias Gotschke, Javier Grandal, Enrique Calleja, Lutz Geelhaar, Oliver Brandt</i>
<p>We investigate the axial and radial growth of GaN nanowires upon a variation
of the Ga flux during molecular beam epitaxial growth. An increase in the Ga
flux promotes radial growth without affecting the axial growth rate. In
contrast, a decrease in the Ga flux reduces the axial growth rate without any
change in the radius. These results are explained by a kinetic growth model
that accounts for both the diffusion of Ga adatoms along the side facets
towards the nanowire tip and the finite amount of active N available for the
growth. The model explains the formation of a new equilibrium nanowire radius
after increasing the Ga flux and provides an explanation for two well known but
so far not understood experimental facts: the necessity of effectively N-rich
conditions for the spontaneous growth of GaN nanowires and the increase in
nanowire radius with increasing III/V flux ratios.

<h3>Monitoring the formation of nanowires by line-of-sight quadrupole mass  spectrometry: a comprehensive description of the temporal evolution of GaN  nanowire ensembles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01757</a>
<br>
<i>Sergio Fernández-Garrido, Johannes K. Zettler, Lutz Geelhaar, Oliver Brandt</i>
<p>We use line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry to monitor the spontaneous
formation of GaN nanowires on Si during molecular beam epitaxy. We find that
the temporal evolution of nanowire ensembles is well described by a double
logistic function. The analysis of the temporal evolution of nanowire ensembles
prepared under a wide variety of growth conditions allows us to construct a
growth diagram which can be used to predict the average delay time that
precedes nanowire formation.

<h3>A Perspective on Plasticity, Dissipation and the 2nd Law of  Thermodynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01848" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01848</a>
<br>
<i>Alan Needleman</i>
<p>The requirement of a non-negative dissipation rate for all possible
deformation histories is generally imposed on plastic constitutive relations.
This is a constraint analogous to the Coleman-Noll [1] postulate that the
Clausius-Duhem inequality needs to be satisfied for all possible deformation
histories. The physical basis for the Clausius-Duhem inequality is as a
statistical limit for a large number of discrete events for a long time and is
not a fundamental physical requirement for small systems for a short time. The
relation between the requirement of a non-negative dissipation rate and the
Clausius-Duhem inequality is considered. The consequences of imposing a
non-negative dissipation rate for all possible deformation histories are
illustrated for: (i) a single crystal plasticity framework that accounts for
elastic lattice curvature changes as well as elastic lattice straining; and
(ii) for discrete defect theories of plasticity, with attention specifically on
discrete dislocation plasticity for crystalline solids and discrete shear
transformation zone (STZ) plasticity for amorphous solids. Possible less
restrictive conditions on the evolution of dissipation in plasticity
formulations are considered as are implications for stability. The focus is on
open questions and issues.

<h3>Robust Majorana bound state in pseudo-spin domain wall of 2-D  topological insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Subhadeep Chakraborty, Vivekananda Adak, Sourin Das</i>
<p>We investigate helical edge states (HES) emerging at the composite domain
wall of spin and pseudo-spin degrees of freedom in a 2-D bulk governed by the
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang Hamiltonian which underwent quantum spin Hall to
anomalous Hall transition. We numerically study the stability of Majorana bound
state (MBS) formed due to proximity induced superconductivity in these helical
edge states. We establish exceptional robustness of MBS against moderate
chemical potential or magnetic disorder owing to the existence of the
simultaneous orthogonality between the right and the left moving modes both in
spin and pseudo-spin space. Hence our proposal could pave the way to realizing
robust Majorana bound state on 2D platforms.

<h3>Magnetic interactions in doped silicene for spintronics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01880</a>
<br>
<i>L. M. Gomes, A. L. da Rosa</i>
<p>Silicon is a material whose technological application is well established,
and obtaining this material in nanostructured form increases its possibility of
integration in current technology. Silicene is a natural compatibility with
current silicon-based electronics industry. Furthermore, doping is a technique
that can be often used to adjust the band gap of silicene and at the same time
introduce new functions. Here we investigate Several aspects of silicene doping
with chromium, such as dopant solubility limits, site preference for adsorption
and doping, and formation of magnetic domains. In this work we carried out
investigation on diffusion and doping of chromium atoms on silicene. We use
density-functional theory to identify the electronic and magnetic properties of
tchromium atoms on monolayer and bilayer silicene. We find that magnetization
depends on key parameters such as buckling, interlayer distance and adsorption
site.

<h3>Why is the Dynamics of Glasses Super-Arrhenius?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01883" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01883</a>
<br>
<i>Jean-Philippe Bouchaud</i>
<p>The steep increase of the relaxation time of glass forming liquids upon
cooling is traditionally ascribed to an impending entropy crisis: since the
system has "nowhere to go", dynamics must come to a halt. This classic
argument, due to Adam \& Gibbs, has been bolstered and refined by the
development of the Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory, which fares
remarkably well at reproducing most salient experimental facts of super-cooled
liquids. All static predictions of RFOT, including the existence of a
point-to-set length and the role of pinning sites, have been vindicated by
detailed numerical simulations. Yet, there is no consensus that the basic
mechanism explaining the glass transition is the one captured by RFOT. Strong
doubts have emerged following the observation that adding or removing kinetic
constraints can change the relaxation time by orders of magnitude, while
leaving thermodynamics unchanged. This is at odds with the idea of a one-to-one
mapping between excess entropy and relaxation time.
In the following discussion paper presented at the Solvay conference in
October 2023, we review areas of consensus and dissent of RFOT with other
competing theoretical proposals, and propose possible paths for (partial)
reconciliation. We further argue that extensive numerical simulations of the
non-linear susceptibility of glasses, in particular in the aging regime, should
shed important light on the mechanism at the origin of the super-Arrhenius
behaviour of the relaxation time. In any case, more imagination is still needed
to come up with experimental, theoretical or numerical ideas that would allow
to finally settle the question of why glasses do not flow.

<h3>Refined bounds on energy harvesting from anisotropic fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01973</a>
<br>
<i>Jordi Ventura Siches, Olga Movilla Miangolarra, Tryphon T. Georgiou</i>
<p>We consider overdamped Brownian particles with two degrees of freedom (DoF)
that are confined in a time-varying quadratic potential and are in simultaneous
contact with heat baths of different temperatures along the respective DoF. The
anisotropy in thermal fluctuations can be used to extract work by suitably
manipulating the confining potential. The question of what the maximal amount
of work that can be extracted is has been raised in recent work, and has been
computed under the simplifying assumption that the entropy of the distribution
of particles (thermodynamic states) remains constant throughout a thermodynamic
cycle. Indeed, it was shown that the maximal amount of work that can be
extracted amounts to solving an isoperimetric problem, where the 2-Wasserstein
length traversed by thermodynamic states quantifies dissipation that can be
traded off against an area integral that quantifies work drawn out of the
thermal anisotropy. Here, we remove the simplifying assumption on constancy of
entropy and carry out the analysis without any restriction on the thermodynamic
cycle. We show that the work drawn can be computed similarly to the case where
the entropy is kept constant while the dissipation can be reduced by suitably
tilting the thermodynamic cycle in a thermodynamic space with one additional
dimension. Optimal cycles can be locally approximated by solutions to an
isoperimetric problem in a tilted lower-dimensional subspace.

<h3>Spintronic devices and applications using noncollinear anti-chiral  antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01977</a>
<br>
<i>Ankit Shukla, Siyuan Qian, Shaloo Rakheja</i>
<p>Antiferromagnetic materials have a vanishingly small net magnetization, which
generates weak dipolar fields and makes them robust against external magnetic
perturbation and rapid magnetization dynamics, as dictated by the geometric
mean of their exchange and anisotropy energies. However, experimental and
theoretical techniques to detect and manipulate the antiferromagnetic order in
a fully electrical manner must be developed to enable advanced spintronic
devices with antiferromagnets (AFMs) as their active spin-dependent elements.
Among the various AFMs, conducting AFMs offer high electrical and thermal
conductivities and strong electron-spin-phonon interactions. Noncollinear
metallic AFMs with negative chirality, including Mn3Sn, Mn3Ge, and Mn3GaN,
offer rich physics that arises from their topology. In this review article, we
introduce the crystal structure and the physical phenomena observed in negative
chirality AFMs. Experimental and theoretical advances related to
current-induced dynamics on the spin structure of Mn3Sn are discussed. We then
present a potential AFM spintronic device that can serve as a non-volatile
memory, high-frequency signal generator, neuron emulator, and even a
probabilistic bit, depending on the design parameters and the input stimuli,
i.e., amplitude and pulse width of the injected spin current and the external
magnetic field. In this device, spin-orbit torques can be used to manipulate
the order parameter, while the device state can be read via tunneling
magnetoresistance. We also present analytic models that relate the performance
characteristics of the device with its design parameters, thus enabling a rapid
technology-device assessment. Effects of Joule heating and thermal noise on the
device characteristics are briefly discussed. We close the paper by summarizing
the status of research and present our outlook in this rapidly evolving
research field.

<h3>Bulk Photovoltaics in Nanoscale Systems - Origin of Shift Currents in  the Many-Body Picture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02002" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02002</a>
<br>
<i>MingRui Lai, Fengyuan Xuan, Su Ying Quek</i>
<p>The shift current in bulk photovoltaics is commonly attributed to a shift in
non-interacting charge centres. We show that the origin of shift currents in
the many-body picture is fundamentally different. Here the shift current arises
largely from a many-body shift vector that also involves shifts in charge
centres, but these are associated with pairs of nearly-degenerate excitons
overlapping in k-space. The shift current can thus be enhanced by
nearly-degenerate, optically-active and tightly- bound excitons, spread out in
k-space. Ab initio results are presented for BaTiO$_3$, NbOCl$_2$ and MoS$_2$.

<h3>Critical behavior around the fixed points driven by fermion-fermion  interactions and disorders in the nodal-line superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02040" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02040</a>
<br>
<i>Wen-Hao Bian, Jing Wang</i>
<p>We systematically investigate the intricate interplay between short-range
fermion-fermion interactions and disorder scatterings beneath the
superconducting dome of noncentrosymmetric nodal-line superconductors.
Employing the renormalization group that unbiasedly treats all kinds of
potential degrees of freedom, we establish energy-dependent coupled flows for
all associated interaction parameters. Decoding the low-energy information from
these coupled evolutions leads to the emergence of several intriguing behavior
in the low-energy regime. At first, we identify eight distinct types of fixed
points, which are determined by the competition of all interaction parameters
and dictate the low-energy properties. Next, we carefully examine and unveil
distinct fates of physical implications as approaching such fixed points. The
density of states of quasiparticles displays a linear dependence on frequency
around the first fixed point, while other fixed points present diverse
frequency-dependent behavior. Compressibility and specific heat exhibit unique
trends around different fixed points, with the emergence of non-Fermi-liquid
behavior nearby the fifth fixed point. Furthermore, after evaluating the
susceptibilities of the potential states, we find that a certain phase
transition below the critical temperature can be induced when the system
approaches the fifth fixed point, transitioning from the nodal-line
superconducting state to another superconducting state. This research would
enhance our understanding of the unique behavior in the low-energy regime of
nodal-line superconductors.

<h3>Lattice-dynamics and in-plane antiferromagnetism in MnxZn1_xPS3 across  the entire composition range</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02102</a>
<br>
<i>Robert Oliva, Esther Ritov, Faris Horani, Iñigo Etxebarria, Adam K. Budniak, Yaron Amouyal, Efrat Lifshitz, Mael Guennou</i>
<p>Alloyed MnxZn1_xPS3 samples have been grown covering the whole compositional
range and studied by means of Raman spectroscopy at temperatures covering from
4K up to 850K. Our results, supported by SQUID magnetic measurements, allowed,
from one hand, to complete the magnetic phase diagram of MnxZn1_xPS3 and
establish x>0.3 as the composition at which the alloy retains
antiferromagnetism and, from the other hand, to identify the Raman signatures
indicative of a magnetic transition. The origin of these Raman signatures is
discussed in terms of spin-phonon coupling resulting in the appearance of low-
and high-frequency zone-folded phonon modes. For the alloy, an assignment of
the 1st and 2nd order modes is provided with the aid of first-principle
lattice-dynamical calculations. The compositional dependence of all phonon
modes is described and the presence of zone-folded modes is shown to take place
for both, the alloy and MnPS3. Finally, a comparison of the Raman spectra of
ZnPS3 to other compounds of the transition-metal phosphorous trisulfide family
allowed shows that low-frequency phonon peaks exhibit an abnormally large
broadening. This is consistent with previous claims on the occurrence of a
second-order Jahn-Teller effect that takes place for ZnPS3 and Zn-rich
MnxZn1_xPS3.

<h3>Generalized transmon Hamiltonian for Andreev spin qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02118" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02118</a>
<br>
<i>Luka Pavešić, Rok Žitko</i>
<p>We solve the problem of an interacting quantum dot embedded in a Josephson
junction between two superconductors with finite charging energy described by
the transmon (Cooper pair box) Hamiltonian. The approach is based on the
flat-band approximation of the Richardson model, which reduces the Hilbert
space to the point where exact diagonalisation is possible while retaining all
states that are necessary to describe the low energy phenomena. The presented
method accounts for the physics of the quantum dot, the Josephson effect and
the Coulomb repulsion (charging energy) at the same level. In particular, it
captures the quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase as well as the
coupling between the superconducting phase and the quantum dot (spin) degrees
of freedom. The method can be directly applied for modelling Andreev spin
qubits embedded in transmon circuits in all parameter regimes, for describing
time-dependent processes, and for the calculation of transition matrix elements
for microwave-driven transmon, spin-flip and mixed transitions that involve
coupling to charge or current degree of freedom.

<h3>Theory of symmetry-resolved quench-drive spectroscopy: Nonlinear  response of phase-fluctuating superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02120" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02120</a>
<br>
<i>Matteo Puviani</i>
<p>Recent experiments on cuprates have shown the possibility of opening a gap
above the superconducting critical temperature, in the so-called
phase-fluctuating state, by enhancing the phase coherence of preformed Cooper
pairs. Quench-drive spectroscopy, an implementation of 2D coherent
spectroscopy, has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating
out-of-equilibrium superconductors and their collective modes. In this work, we
enrich the quench-drive scheme by developing a systematic generalization to
study the nonlinear response of $d$-wave fully incoherent Cooper pairs in a
symmetry resolved manner. In particular, we do not only show that it is
possible to obtain a third harmonic signal from fully incoherent pairs with an
equilibrium vanishing order parameter, but we also characterize the full
flourishing 2D spectrum of the generated nonlinear response. The results
provide a deeper theoretical insight on recent experimental results, opening
the door to a new symmetry-driven design of future experiments on
unconventional and enhanced superconductors.

<h3>Weyl semimetallic state with antiferromagnetic order in Rashba-Hubbard  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02131" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02131</a>
<br>
<i>Aastha Jain, Garima Goyal, Dheeraj Kumar Singh</i>
<p>We study the phase diagram of Rashba-Hubbard model by employing the
Hartree-Fock meanfield theory, and thereby establish the existence of an
antiferromagnetically ordered Weyl semimetallic state with in-plane magnetic
moments. This phase is found to be sandwiched in between the antiferromagnetic
insulator and Rashba metal in the interaction vs spin-orbit coupling phase
diagram. The antiferromagnetically-ordered topological semimetallic state
exists in the presence of combined time-reversal and inversion symmetry though
individually both are broken. The study of the static magnetic susceptibility
indicates the robustness of the antiferromagnetic order within a realistic
range of interaction and spin-orbit coupling parameters. In addition to the
edge states associated with the Weyl points, we also investigate the
spin-resolved quasiparticle interference, which provides important insight into
the possible spin texture of the bands especially in the vicinity of Weyl
points.

<p>Material challenges are the key issue in Majorana nanowires where surface
disorder constrains device performance. Here, we tackle this challenge by
embedding PbTe nanowires within a latticematched crystal, an oxide-free
environment. The wire edges are shaped by self-organized growth instead of
lithography, resulting in nearly-atomic-flat facets along both cross-sectional
and longitudinal directions. Quantized conductance plateaus are observed at
zero magnetic field with channel lengths reaching 1.54 $\mu$m, significantly
surpassing the state-of-the-art of III-V nanowires (nearly an
order-of-magnitude improvement compared to InSb). Coupling PbTe to a Pb film
unveils a flat interface spanning microns and a large superconducting gap of 1
meV. Our results meet the stringent low-disorder requirement for the definitive
observation of Majoranas.

<h3>Microwave-assisted unidirectional superconductivity in Al-InAs  nanowire-Al junctions under magnetic fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02137" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02137</a>
<br>
<i>Haitian Su, Ji-Yin Wang, Han Gao, Yi Luo, Shili Yan, Xingjun Wu, Guoan Li, Jie Shen, Li Lu, Dong Pan, Jianhua Zhao, Po Zhang, H. Q. Xu</i>
<p>Under certain symmetry-breaking conditions, a superconducting system exhibits
asymmetric critical currents, dubbed the ``superconducting diode effect" (SDE).
Recently, systems with the ideal superconducting diode efficiency or
unidirectional superconductivity (USC) have received considerable interest. In
this work, we report the study of Al-InAs nanowire-Al Josephson junctions under
microwave irradiation and magnetic fields. We observe an enhancement of SDE
under microwave driving, featured by a horizontal offset of the zero-voltage
step in the voltage-current characteristic that increases with microwave power.
Devices reach the USC regime at sufficiently high driving amplitudes. The
offset changes sign with the reversal of the magnetic field direction.
Meanwhile, the offset magnitude exhibits a roughly linear response to the
microwave power in dBm when both the power and the magnetic field are large.
The signatures observed are reminiscent of a recent theoretical proposal using
the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. However, the experimental results
are not fully explained by the RSJ model, indicating a new mechanism for USC
that is possibly related to non-equilibrium dynamics in periodically driven
superconducting systems.

<h3>Observation of Ballistic Thermal Transport in a Nonintegrable Classical  Many-Body System</h3>

<br>
<i>Jianjin Wang, Daxing Xiong</i>
<p>We report, for the first time, the observation of ballistic thermal transport
in a nonintegrable classical many-body system. This claim is substantiated by
appropriately incorporating long-range interactions into the system, which
exhibits all characteristic hallmarks of ballistic heat transport, including
the presence of equilibrium dynamical correlations exhibiting ballistic
scaling, a size-independent energy current and a flat bulk temperature profile.
These findings hold true for large system sizes (long times), indicating that
ballistic heat transport is valid in the thermodynamic limit. The underlying
mechanism is attributed to the presence of traveling discrete breathers in the
relevant nonintegrabel systems surpassing conventional solitons in a nonlinear
integrable Toda system.

<i>Jinhong Park, Christian Spånslätt, Alexander D. Mirlin</i>
<p>Despite recent experimental developments, the topological order of the
fractional quantum Hall state at filling $\nu=5/2$ remains an outstanding
question. We study conductance and shot noise in a quantum point contact device
in the charge-equilibrated regime and show that, among Pfaffian, particle-hole
Praffian, and anti-Pfaffian (aPf) candidate states, the hole-conjugate aPf
state is unique in that it can produce a conductance plateau at $G=(7/3)e^2/h$
by two fundamentally distinct mechanisms. We demonstrate that these mechanisms
can be distinguished by shot noise measurements on the plateaus. We also
determine distinct features of the conductance of the aPf state in the coherent
regime. Our results can be used to experimentally single out the aPf order.

<h3>The Harmonic Oscillator Potential Perturbed by a Combination of Linear  and Non-linear Dirac Delta Interactions with Application to Bose-Einstein  Condensation</h3>

<i>Cenk Akyüz, Fatih Erman, Haydar Uncu</i>
<p>In this paper, we study the bound state analysis of a one dimensional
nonlinear version of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the harmonic oscillator
potential perturbed by a $\delta$ potential, where the nonlinear term is taken
to be proportional to $\delta(x) |\psi(x)|^2 \psi(x)$. The bound state wave
functions are explicitly found and the bound state energy of the system is
algebraically determined by the solution of an implicit equation. Then, we
apply this model to the Bose-Einstein condensation of a Bose gas in a harmonic
trap with a dimple potential. We propose that the many-body interactions of the
Bose gas can be effectively described by the nonlinear term in the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Then, we investigate the critical temperature, the
condensate fraction, and the density profile of this system numerically.

<i>J. Kalin, S. Sievers, H. Füser, A. Bauer, C. Pfleiderer, H. W. Schumacher, M. Bieler</i>
<p>Transient reflectivity measurements are an invaluable tool to study ultrafast
thermal processes and contribute to the understanding of electron-lattice
interactions and thermal diffusion, providing key information for the numerical
modeling of thermally-excited ultrafast magnetic phenomena. Accurately
extracting the material's temperature response from transient reflectivity
requires a precise understanding of ultrafast processes influencing
reflectivity, which is challenging in magnetic materials due to the intricate
interplay of electron, charge, and spin degree of freedom. Here, we report
transient reflectivity measurements on MnSi, an archetypical chiral magnet with
strong magnetoelastic coupling. We find unipolar response in the paramagnetic
state and bipolar response in states exhibiting magnetic long-range order.
Comparison with thermal expansion data from literature suggests that the
bipolar response originates in the ultrafast magneto-volume effect due to
magnetoelastic coupling, which enables the extraction of characteristic
timescales of this effect from transient reflectivity. These findings highlight
that magnetoelastic coupling needs to be taken into account for accurately
interpreting the transient reflectivity of magnetic materials, extending the
standard picture of transient reflectivity.

<p>Investigating finite temperature effects on quantum phases is key to their
experimental realization. Finite temperature, and the interplay between quantum
and thermal fluctuations can undermine properties and/or key features of
quantum systems but they can also bring upon interesting phenom- ena. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the finite temperature phase
diagram of two-dimensional lattice dipolar bosons coupled to a high-finesse
optical cavity. Interestingly, we observe that checkerboard density-density
correlations are enhanced at finite temperature. Indeed, we found that finite
temperature drives a superfluid ground state into a normal state which will
then develop checkerboard order at higher temperatures. We show that this
effect is solely due to the cavity-mediated interactions. We also confirm that
the supersolid checkerboard phase survives for a wide range of filling factors
up to temperature scale of the order of half hopping amplitude, while the
checkerboard diagonal order can survive up to temperatures of a few hopping
amplitudes.

<i>Boris N. Slautin, Utkarsh Pratiush, Ilia N. Ivanov, Yongtao Liu, Rohit Pant, Xiaohang Zhang, Ichiro Takeuchi, Maxim A. Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin</i>
<p>The rapid growth of automated and autonomous instrumentations brings forth an
opportunity for the co-orchestration of multimodal tools, equipped with
multiple sequential detection methods, or several characterization tools to
explore identical samples. This can be exemplified by the combinatorial
libraries that can be explored in multiple locations by multiple tools
simultaneously, or downstream characterization in automated synthesis systems.
In the co-orchestration approaches, information gained in one modality should
accelerate the discovery of other modalities. Correspondingly, the
orchestrating agent should select the measurement modality based on the
anticipated knowledge gain and measurement cost. Here, we propose and implement
a co-orchestration approach for conducting measurements with complex
observables such as spectra or images. The method relies on combining
dimensionality reduction by variational autoencoders with representation
learning for control over the latent space structure, and integrated into
iterative workflow via multi-task Gaussian Processes (GP). This approach
further allows for the native incorporation of the system's physics via a
probabilistic model as a mean function of the GP. We illustrated this method
for different modalities of piezoresponse force microscopy and micro-Raman on
combinatorial $Sm-BiFeO_3$ library. However, the proposed framework is general
and can be extended to multiple measurement modalities and arbitrary
dimensionality of measured signals. The analysis code that supports the funding
is publicly available at https://github.com/Slautin/2024_Co-orchestration.

<h3>Three-body scattering area for particles with infinite or zero  scattering length in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02202" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02202</a>
<br>
<i>Junjie Liang, Shina Tan</i>
<p>We derive the asymptotic expansions of the wave function of three particles
having equal mass with finite-range interactions and infinite or zero
two-dimensional scattering length colliding at zero energy and zero orbital
angular momentum, from which a three-body parameter $D$ is defined. The
dimension of $D$ is length squared, and we call $D$ three-body scattering area.
We find that the ground state energy per particle of a zero-temperature dilute
Bose gas with these interactions is approximately $\frac{\hbar^2 D
}{6m}\rho^2$, where $\rho$ is the number density of the bosons, $m$ is the mass
of each boson, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant over $2\pi$. Such a Bose gas is
stable at $D\geq 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, and metastable at $D<0$ in the
harmonic trap if the number of bosons is less than $N_{cr}\approx 3.6413
\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega |D|}}$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of
the harmonic trap. If the two-body interaction supports bound states, $D$
typically acquires a negative imaginary part, and we find the relation between
this imaginary part and the amplitudes of the pair-boson production processes.
We derive a formula for the three-body recombination rate constant of the
many-boson system in terms of the imaginary part of $D$.

<h3>Pairing properties of an odd-frequency superfluid Fermi gas</h3>

<br>
<i>Shumpei Iwasaki, Taira Kawamura, Koki Manabe, Yoji Ohashi</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate strong-coupling properties of an odd-frequency
Fermi superfluid. This pairing state has the unique property that Cooper pairs
are formed between fermions, not at the same time, but at different times. To
see whether or not such unequal-time pairs still exhibit bosonic behavior, we
examine the space-time structure of the odd-frequency Cooper-pair wavefunction
at $T=0$, by employing the combined path-integral formalism with the
BCS-Eagles-Leggett-type superfluid theory. In the strong-coupling regime, the
odd-frequency pair wavefunction still has different space-time structure from
that in the ordinary even-frequency $s$-wave superfluid state, their
$\textit{magnitudes}$ are found to become close to each other, except for the
equal-time pairing component. In this regime, we also evaluate the superfluid
phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ within the framework of the
strong-coupling theory developed by Nozi\`eres and Schmitt-Rink. The calculated
$T_{\rm c}$ in the strong-coupling regime of the odd-frequency system is found
to be well described by the Bose-Einstein condensation of tightly bound Bose
molecules. Our results indicates that, in spite of vanishing equal-time
pairing, odd-frequency Cooper pairs still behave like bosons in the
strong-coupling regime, as in the even-frequency $s$-wave superfluid case.

<p>Electric currents have the intriguing ability to induce magnetization in
nonmagnetic crystals with sufficiently low crystallographic symmetry. Some
associated phenomena include the non-linear anomalous Hall effect in polar
crystals and the nonreciprocal directional dichroism in chiral crystals when
magnetic fields are applied. In this work, we demonstrate that the same
underlying physics is also manifested in the electronic tunneling process
between the surface of a nonmagnetic chiral material and a magnetized scanning
probe. In the paramagnetic but chiral metallic compound Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, the
magnetization induced by the tunneling current is shown to become detectable by
its coupling to the magnetization of the tip itself. This results in a contrast
across different chiral domains, achieving atomic-scale spatial resolution of
structural chirality. To support the proposed mechanism, we used
first-principles theory to compute the chirality-dependent current-induced
magnetization and Berry curvature in the bulk of the material. Our
demonstration of this magnetochiral tunneling effect opens up a new avenue for
investigating atomic-scale variations in the local crystallographic symmetry
and electronic structure across the structural domain boundaries of
low-symmetry nonmagnetic crystals.

<h3>Contrasting twisted bilayer graphene and transition metal  dichalcogenides for fractional Chern insulators: an emergent gauge picture</h3>

<br>
<i>Heqiu Li, Ying Su, Yong Baek Kim, Hae-Young Kee, Kai Sun, Shi-Zeng Lin</i>
<p>The recent experimental discovery of the zero-field fractional Chern
insulator (FCI) in twisted $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ moir\'e superlattices has sparked
immense interest in this exotic topological quantum state. The FCI has also
been observed in previous experiments in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) under a finite magnetic field of about 5 Tesla. Generally, the
stabilization of FCI requires fine-tuning the topological band to satisfy
certain conditions. It would still be helpful to have an intuitive picture to
understand the different behaviors in twisted $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ and TBG. Here,
we compare them through the lens of emergent gauge fields. In TBG, the system
can be mapped to two Dirac fermions coupled to emergent gauge fields with
opposite signs. In contrast, the twisted $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ reduces to a hole
with parabolic dispersion coupled to an emergent gauge field. This contrasting
gauge structure provides a new perspective on the observed difference: the
zero-field FCI is stable in $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ but absent in TBG. Based on this
understanding, we will explore potential strategies for stabilizing FCI in both
moir\'e superlattices.

<h3>Topological effect on the Anderson transition in chiral symmetry classes</h3>

<br>
<i>Pengwei Zhao, Zhenyu Xiao, Yeyang Zhang, Ryuichi Shindou</i>
<p>The interplay between disorder and weak topology in chiral symmetry classes
leads to an intermediate phase between metal and localized phases, dubbed
quasi-localized phase, where wave function along a spatial direction with weak
topological index is delocalized but exponentially localized along the other
directions. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of the emergent
quasi-localized phase in chiral symmetry classes. The Anderson transition in 2D
chiral symmetry classes is induced by proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs
of a U(1) phase degree of freedom, while the weak topology endows the pair with
Berry phase. We argue that the Berry phase induces spatial polarizations of the
pairs along the topological direction through quantum interference effect, and
the proliferation of the polarized vortex pairs results in the quasi-localized
phase.

<p>Polarimetric infrared detection bolsters IR thermography by leveraging the
polarization of light. Optical anisotropy, i.e., birefringence and dichroism,
can be leveraged to achieve polarimetric detection. Recently, giant optical
anisotropy was discovered in quasi-1D narrow-bandgap hexagonal perovskite
sulfides, A1+xTiS3, specifically BaTiS3[1,2] and Sr9/8TiS3[3,4]. In these
materials, the critical role of atomic-scale structure modulations[4,5] in the
unconventional electrical[5,6], optical[7,8], and thermal[7,9] properties
raises the broader question of other materials that belong to this family. To
address this issue, for the first time, we synthesized high-quality single
crystals of a largely unexplored member of the A1+xTiX3 (X = S, Se) family,
BaTiSe3. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction determined the room-temperature
structure with the P31c space group, which is a superstructure of the earlier
reported[10] P63/mmc structure. The crystal structure of BaTiSe3 features
antiparallel c-axis displacements similar to BaTiS3,[2] but is of lower
symmetry. Polarization-resolved Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy were used to characterize the optical anisotropy of BaTiSe3, whose
refractive index along the ordinary (perpendicular to c) and extraordinary
(parallel to c) optical axes was quantitatively determined by combining
ellipsometry studies with FTIR. With a giant birefringence {\Delta}n~0.9,
BaTiSe3 emerges as a new candidate for miniaturized birefringent optics for
mid-wave infrared to long-wave infrared imaging.

<p>Kagome metals with charge density wave (CDW) order exhibit a broad spectrum
of intriguing quantum phenomena. The recent discovery of the novel kagome CDW
compound ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ has spurred significant interest. However, understanding
the interplay between CDW and the bulk electronic structure has been obscured
by a profusion of surface states and terminations in this quantum material.
Here, we employ photoemission spectroscopy and potassium dosing to elucidate
the complete bulk band structure of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, revealing multiple van Hove
singularities near the Fermi level. We surprisingly discover a robust
spin-polarized topological Dirac surface resonance state at the M point within
the two-fold van Hove singularities. Assisted by the first-principle
calculations, the temperature dependence of the $k_z$- resolved ARPES spectrum
provides unequivocal evidence for the proposed
$\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$$\times3$ charge order over other candidates. Our
work not only enhances the understanding of the CDW-dependent bulk and surface
states in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ but also establishes an essential foundation for
potential manipulation of the CDW order in kagome materials.

<h3>Effective model and electron correlations in trilayer nickelate  superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</h3>

<br>
<i>Peng-Fei Tian, Hao-Tian Ma, Xing Ming, Xiao-Jun Zheng, Huan Li</i>
<p>Recently, signatures of superconductivity with critical temperature from 20
to 30 K have been reported in pressured trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
through a pressure-induced structure transition. Here we explore the evolution
of electronic structures and electronic correlations in different phases of
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under corresponding pressure regions, by using density
functional theory (DFT) combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).
Similar to bilayer superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, the electronic bands are
dominated by Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and 3$d_{z^2}$ orbits near the Fermi level, in
contrast, the inner Ni-O plane in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ generates a doublet
hole-pocket Fermi surfaces around the Brillouin-zone corner, meanwhile one
branch of the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ bands is pushed very close to the Fermi level,
inducing an electron pocket away from $k_z=0$ plane. The DFT+DMFT simulations
suggest that the electronic correlations only give minor modification to the
Fermi surfaces, meanwhile the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ states have a remarkable mass
enhancement with large electron filling. Based on the DFT and DFT+DMFT
simulations, we eventually derive an effective tight-binding model which
includes the Coulomb correlations, which can produce rather precise electronic
bands and Fermi surfaces, hence can serve as an appropriate model to further
study the superconducting mechanism and paring symmetry of trilayer
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.

<p>Strain engineering is a versatile method to boost the carrier mobility of
two-dimensional materials-based electronics and optoelectronic devices. In
addition, strain is ubiquitous during device fabrication via material
deposition on a substrate with a different lattice structure. Here, we show
that the polarization properties of the harmonics in graphene under uniaxial
strain are strongly yet differently affected in the lower and higher orders.
The polarization plane of the lower-order emitted harmonics is rotated -- a
manifestation of Faraday rotation due to the broken symmetry planes. In
contrast, we observe elliptically-polarized higher-order harmonics due to the
intricate interplay of the interband and intraband electron dynamics. The
implications of these findings are twofold: First, we show how the rotation of
the polarization plane of the lower-order harmonics can be used as a probe to
characterize the strain's nature, strength, and angle. Second, we demonstrate
how strain engineering can be used to alter the polarization properties of
higher-order harmonics, relevant for applications in ultrafast chiral-sensitive
studies. Our research opens a promising avenue for strain-tailored polarization
properties of higher-order harmonics in engineered solids.

<h3>Frustration - no frustration crossover and phase transitions in 2D spin  models with zig-zag structure</h3>

<i>Jozef Sznajd</i>
<p>Three 2D spin models made of frustrated zig-zag chains with competing
interactions which by exact summation with respect to some degrees of freedom
can be replaced by an effective temperature-dependent interaction were
considered. The first model, exactly solvable Ising chains coupled by only
four-spin interactions does not exhibit any finite temperature phase
transition, nevertheless temperature can trigger a frustration - no frustration
crossover accompanied by gigantic specific heat. A similar effect was observed
in several two-leg ladder models [Yin Weiguo, arXiv:2006.08921v2 (2020),
2006.15087v1 (2020)]. The anisotropic Ising chains coupled by a direct
interchain interaction and competing with it indirect interaction via spins
located between chains are analyzed by using exact Onsager's equation and
linear perturbation renormalization group (LPRG). Depending on the parameter
set such a model exhibits one antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (FM)
phase transition or three phase transitions with reentrant disordered phase
between AF and FM ones. The LPRG method was also used to study coupled uniaxial
$XXZ$ chains which, for example, can be a minimal model to describe the
magnetic properties of compounds in which uranium and rare earth atoms form
zig-zag chains. As with the Ising model for a certain set of parameters the
model can undergo three phase transitions. However, both inchain and interchain
plain interactions $s_{i,j}^x s_{k,l}^x+s_{i,j}^y s_{k,l}^y$ can eliminate the
reentrant disordered phase and then only one transition takes place.
Additionally, the $XXZ$ model can undergo temperature-induced metamagnetic
transition.

<p>Controlling the electronic structure of two-dimensional materials using the
combination of twist angle and electrostatic doping is an effective means to
induce emergent phenomena. In bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist angle
near the magic angle, the electronic dispersion is strongly modified by a
manifold of hybridizing moir\'e Dirac cones leading to flat band segments with
strong electronic correlations. Numerous technical challenges arising from
spatial inhomogeneity of interlayer interactions, twist angle and device
functionality have so far limited momentum-resolved electronic structure
measurements of these systems to static conditions. Here, we present a detailed
characterization of the electronic structure exhibiting miniband dispersions
for twisted bilayer graphene, near the magic angle, integrated in a functional
device architecture using micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. The optimum conditions for visualizing the miniband dispersion
are determined by exploiting the spatial resolution and photon energy
tunability of the light source and applied to extract a hybridization gap size
of $(0.14 \pm 0.03)$~eV and flat band segments extending across a moir\'e mini
Brillouin zone. \textit{In situ} electrostatic gating of the sample enables
significant electron-doping, causing the conduction band states to shift below
the Fermi energy. Our work emphasizes key challenges in probing the electronic
structure of magic angle bilayer graphene devices and outlines conditions for
exploring the doping-dependent evolution of the dispersion that underpins the
ability to control many-body interactions in the material.

<p>The plastic deformation of Cr3+ -doped a-Al2 O3 (ruby) with four distinct Cr
concentrations has been studied at temperatures between 900 and 1500 $^\circ$C.
The mechanical tests indicate that the processes of dislocation multiplication
and the adjustments of the slip velocity of these dislocations to the imposed
strain rate in undoped a-Al2 O3 are not significantly affected by the Cr
concentra%on. The yield stress increment is approximately constant with
temperature and the hardening increases with the Cr concentration. The critical
resolved shear stress (CRSS) is fixed to a model based on dislocation glide
controlled by the nucleation and propagation of kink pairs, modified to include
the hardening due to Cr. Satisfactory fits are achieved with adjustable
parameters close to those employed for undoped a-Al2 O3 .

methane gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities at room temperature and
moderate pressures, 25-35 MPa, comparable or higher than the storage capacities
of classical and Al-based MOFs.

<p>Josephson junctions enable dissipation-less electrical current through metals
and insulators below a critical current. Despite being central to quantum
technology based on superconducting quantum bits and fundamental research into
self-conjugate quasiparticles, the spatial distribution of super current flow
at the junction and its predicted evolution with current bias and external
magnetic field remain experimentally elusive. Revealing the hidden current
flow, featureless in electrical resistance, helps understanding unconventional
phenomena such as the nonreciprocal critical current, i.e., Josephson diode
effect. Here we introduce a platform for nanoscale, quantitative, and
nonperturbative visualization of the super current flow, overcoming the
long-standing challenge. Utilizing a scanning magnetometer based on nitrogen
vacancy centers in diamond, we uncover competing ground states electrically
switchable within the zero-resistance regime. The competition results from the
superconducting phase re-configuration induced by the Josephson current and
kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. We further identify a new
mechanism for the Josephson diode effect involving the Josephson current
induced phase. The nanoscale super current flow emerges as a new experimental
observable for elucidating unconventional superconductivity, and optimizing
quantum computation and energy-efficient devices.

<p>The ability to mimic protein-based oxidase with multi-functional inorganic
nanozymes would greatly advance biomedical and clinical practices. Praseodymia
(PrOx) nanorods (NRs) and nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized using
hydrothermal and precipitation methods. Both PrOx catalysts with different
morphologies exhibit significantly higher oxidase-like activities
(Michaelis-Menten constant Km < 0.026 mM) than commercial PrOx and most
so-far-reported artificial enzymes. One of the substrates, dopamine, can be
oxidized and further polymerized to generate polydopamine in acidic conditions.
Akin to CeO2, which is a well-studied nanozyme, a different mechanism involving
holes+, oxygen vacancies and oxygen mobility over PrOx catalysts has been
proposed in this work. However, fluoride ions were found to impose opposite
effects on the oxidase-mimicking activity of PrOx and CeO2, implying a
promising path for the exploration of new nanozymes. In support of this, PrOx
was further applied in colorimetric sensing of L-cysteine and fluoride with
high sensitivity.

<h3>Deconstructing the spin susceptibility of a cuprate superconductor</h3>

<p>A major obstacle to understanding high-Tc cuprates is that superconductivity
precludes observing normal-state properties at low temperatures. One prime
example is the normal-state spin susceptibility: although its decrease upon
cooling far above Tc typifies pseudogap behavior, its behavior at low
temperatures is generally unknown. Here, our measurements in high magnetic
fields expose the spin susceptibility of YBa2Cu3Oy down to low temperatures.
Even though superconductivity is suppressed by the field, we uncover two
thermally-activated contributions alongside a residual susceptibility at T=0
due to gapless excitations. We relate these two distinct gaps to short-range
charge-density waves and to the formation of spin singlets similar to those
found in certain quantum spin systems. These phenomena thus collectively
contribute to the pseudogap in the spin susceptibility at low temperature,
supplementing short-lived antiferromagnetism known to initiate pseudogap
behavior at high temperatures. We therefore propose that the pseudogap should
be regarded as a composite property.

<h3>Universal condensation energy scaling for both conventional and high  $T_c$ superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, S.A. Artamonov</i>
<p>We analyze the scaling of the condensation energy $E_{\Delta}$ divided by
$\gamma$, $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\simeq N(0)\Delta_1^2/\gamma$, of both conventional
superconductors and unconventional high-$T_c$ one, where $N(0)$ is the density
of states, $\Delta_1$ is the maximum value of the superconducting gap and
$\gamma$ is the Sommerfeld coefficient. For the first time, we show that the
universal scaling of $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\propto T_c^2$ applies equally to
conventional superconductors and unconventional high-$T_c$ ones. Our
consideration is based on both facts: Bogoliubov quasiparticles act in
conventional and unconventional superconductors, and the corresponding flat
band is deformed by the unconventional superconducting state. As a result, our
theoretical observations based on the fermion condensation theory are in good
agreement with experimental facts.

<h3>Non-Fermi Liquid and Hund Correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under High  Pressure</h3>

<i>Jing-Xuan Wang, Zhenfeng Ouyang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<p>High temperature superconductivity was recently found in the bilayer
nickelate $\rm{La}_3 \rm{Ni}_2 \rm{O}_7$ (La327), followed by the discovery of
superconductivity in the trilayer $\rm{La}_4 \rm{Ni}_3 \rm{O}_{10}$ (La4310),
under high pressure. Through studying the electronic correlation of La4310 with
DFT+DMFT, and further comparing it with that of La327, we find that the $e_g$
orbitals of the outer-layer Ni cations in La4310 have a similar (but slightly
weaker) electronic correlation to those in La327, in which the electrons behave
as a non-Fermi liquid with Hund correlation and linear-in-temperature
scattering rate. Our results suggest that the experimentally observed ``strange
metal'' behavior may be explained by the Hund spin correlation featuring high
spin states and spin-orbital separation. In contrast, the electrons in the
inner-layer Ni cations in La4310 behave as a Fermi liquid. The weaker
electronic correlation in La4310 is attributed to more hole-doping, which may
explain its lower superconducting transition temperature.

<h3>Second-order charge and spin transport in LaO/STO system in the presence  of cubic Rashba spin orbit couplings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02652" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02652</a>
<br>
<i>Zhuo Bin Siu, Anirban Kundu, Mansoor B. A. Jalil</i>
<p>Certain non-centrosymmetric materials with broken time-reversal symmetry may
exhibit non-reciprocal transport behavior under an applied electric field in
which the charge and spin currents contain components that are second order in
the electric field. In this study, we investigate the second-order spin
accumulation and charge and spin responses in the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LaO/STO)
system with magnetic dopants under the influence of linear and cubic Rashba
spin--orbit coupling (RSOC) terms. We explain the physical origin of the
second-order response and perform a symmetry analysis of the first and
second-order responses for different dopant magnetization directions relative
to the applied electric field. We then numerically solve the Boltzmann
transport equation by extending the approach of Schliemann and Loss [Phys. Rev.
B 68, 165311] to higher orders in the electric field. We show that the sign of
the second-order responses can be switched by varying the magnetization
direction of the magnetic dopants or relative strengths of the two cubic RSOC
terms and explain these trends by considering the Fermi surfaces of the
respective systems. These findings provide insights into the interplay of
multiple SOC effects in a LaO/STO system and how the resulting first- and
second-order charge and spin responses can be engineered by exploiting the
symmetries of the system.

<h3>Half Quantum Mirror Hall Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02654" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02654</a>
<br>
<i>Bo Fu, Kai-Zhi Bai, Shun-Qing Shen</i>
<p>We report the discovery of the half-quantized mirror Hall effect, a novel
quantum-anomaly induced by mirror symmetry in a strong topological insulator
(TI) film. These films are known to host a pair of gapless Dirac cones
associated with surface electrons. Our findings reveal that mirror symmetry
assigns a unique mirror parity to each Dirac cone, resulting in a
half-quantized Hall conductance of $\pm\frac{e^{2}}{2h}$ for each cone. Despite
the total electric Hall conductance being null due to time-reversal invariance,
the difference in the Hall conductance between the two cones yields a quantized
Hall conductance of $\frac{e^{2}}{h}$ for the difference in mirror currents.
The effect of helical edge mirror current, a crucial feature of this quantum
effect, can be determined by means of electrical measurements. Overall, the
half-quantum mirror Hall effect reveals a new type of mirror-symmetry induced
quantum anomaly in a time-reversal invariant lattice system, giving rise to a
topological metallic state of matter with time-reversal invariance.

<h3>Intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional honeycomb topological  antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02685</a>
<br>
<i>Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhongbo Yan</i>
<p>Two-dimensional systems with honeycomb lattice are known to be a paradigmatic
platform to explore the various types of Hall effects, owing to that the
interplay of lattice geometry, spin-orbit coupling and magnetism can give rise
to very rich features in the quantum geometry of wave functions. In this work,
we consider honeycomb topological antiferromagets that are effectively
described by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic Kane-Mele model, and
explore the evolution of its nonlinear Hall response with respect to the change
of lattice anisotropy, chemical potential, and the direction of the N\'{e}el
vector. Due to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the leading-order Hall effect of
quantum geometric origin is the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, which is a
second-order effect of electric fields and is independent of the scattering
time. We investigate the behavior of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity
tensor across topological phase transitions driven by antiferromagnetic
exchange field and lattice anisotropy and find that its components do not
change sign, which is different from the extrinsic nonlinear Hall effect. In
the weakly doped regime, we find that the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect is
valley-polarized. By varying the chemical potential, we find that the nonlinear
Hall conductivity tensors exhibit kinks when the Fermi surface undergoes
Lifshitz transitions. Furthermore, we find that the existence of spin-orbit
coupling to lift the spin-rotation symmetry is decisive for the use of
intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect to detect the direction of the N\'{e}el vector.
Our work shows that the two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets
are an ideal class of material systems with rich properties for the study of
intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect.

<p>Despite over a decade of intense research efforts, the full potential of
two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides continues to be limited by
major challenges. The lack of compatible and scalable dielectric materials and
integration techniques restrict device performances and their commercial
applications Conventional dielectric integration techniques for bulk
semiconductors are difficult to adapt for atomically thin two-dimensional

emerging dielectric synthesis and integration techniques and discusses their
applicability for 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. Dielectric integration
for various applications is reviewed in subsequent sections including
nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, flexible electronics, valleytronics,
biosensing, quantum information processing, and quantum sensing. For each
application, we introduce basic device working principles, discuss the specific
dielectric requirements, review current progress, present key challenges, and

<h3>Bifurcation to complex dynamics in largely modulated voltage-controlled  parametric oscillator</h3>

<br>
<i>Tomohiro Taniguchi</i>
<p>An experimental demonstration of a parametric oscillation of a magnetization
in a ferromagnet was performed recently by applying a microwave voltage,
indicating the potential to be applied in a switching method in non-volatile
memories. In the previous works, the modulation of a perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy field produced by the microwave voltage was small compared with an
external magnetic field pointing in an in-plane direction. A recent trend is,
however, opposite, where an efficiency of the voltage controlled magnetic
anisotropy (VCMA) effect is increased significantly by material research and
thus, the modulated magnetic anisotropy field can be larger than the external
magnetic field. Here, we solved the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
numerically and investigated the magnetization dynamics driven under a wide
range of the microwave VCMA effect. We evaluated bifurcation diagrams, which
summarize local maxima of the magnetization dynamics. For low modulation
amplitudes, the local maximum is a single point because the dynamics is the
periodic parametric oscillation. The bifurcation diagrams show distributions of
the local maxima when the microwave magnetic anisotropy field becomes larger
than the external magnetic field. The appearance of this broadened distribution
indicates complex dynamics such as chaotic and transient-chaotic behaviors,
which were confirmed from an analysis of temporal dynamics.

<h3>Supersymmetry dictated topology in periodic gauge fields and realization  in strained and twisted 2D materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Dawei Zhai, Wang Yao</i>
<p>Supersymmetry (SUSY) of Hamiltonian dictates double degeneracy between a pair
of superpartners (SPs) transformed by supercharge, except at zero energy where
modes remain unpaired in many cases. Here we explore a SUSY of complete
isospectrum between SPs -- with paired zero modes -- realized by 2D electrons
in zero-flux periodic gauge fields, which can describe twisted or periodically
strained 2D materials. We find their low-energy sector containing zero (or
threshold) modes must be topologically non-trivial, by proving that Chern
numbers of the two SPs have a finite difference dictated by the number of zero
modes and energy dispersion in their vicinity. In $30^\circ$ twisted bilayer
(double bilayer) transition metal dichalcogenides subject to periodic strain,
we find one SP is topologically trivial in its lowest miniband, while the twin
SP of identical dispersion has a Chern number of $1$ ($2$), in stark contrast
to time-reversal partners that have to be simultaneously trivial or nontrivial.
For systems whose physical Hamiltonian corresponds to the square root of a SUSY
Hamiltonian, such as twisted or strained bilayer graphene, we reveal that
topological properties of the two SUSY SPs are transferred respectively to the
conduction and valence bands, including the contrasted topology in the
low-energy sector and identical topology in the high-energy sector. This offers
a unified perspective for understanding topological properties in many
flat-band systems described by such square-root models.

<p>We study theoretically a setup consisting of excitons formed in two valleys,
with proximity-induced Cooper pairing, different in conduction and valence
bands. Due to the combination of Coulomb interaction with superconducting
proximity effects, Cooper pairing between electrons from conduction and valence
bands from different valleys is formed. This finite-energy intervalley Cooper
pairing has both even- and odd-frequency contributions. We show that there is a
phase transition into formation of a macroscopic condensate of such Cooper
pairs and present characteristics of the corresponding Higgs modes.

<h3>Quantification of the volume-fraction reduction of sheared fragile  glass-forming liquids and its impact on rheology</h3>

<br>
<i>Akira Furukawa</i>
<p>This study determines the volume-fraction reduction of sheared fragile
glass-forming liquids. We consider a group of hypothetical systems that consist
of particles with anisotropic particle-size modulations yet have almost the
same average particle configuration as actual systems under shear flow. Our
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that one specific hypothetical
system can reproduce the relaxation dynamics of an actual sheared system, and
we identify the shear-flow effect on the particle size with anisotropic
size-modulation of this specific system. Then, based on the determination of
the particle size and the resultant volume fraction, we rationalize how slight
decreases in the volume fraction significantly reduce the viscosity snf provide
a nonlinear constitutive equation. Notably, the obtained rheological
predictions, including the crossover shear rate from Newtonian to non-Newtonian
behavior, can be expressed only in terms of experimental observables, showing a
good agreement with the MD simulation results. Our perspective on the volume
fraction under shear flow may provide new insights into the conventional
concept of free-volume.

<h3>Realizing and detecting Stiefel-Whitney insulators in an optical Raman  lattice</h3>

<i>Jian-Te Wang, Jing-Xin Liu, Hai-Tao Ding, Peng He</i>
<p>We propose a feasible scheme to realize a four-band Stiefel-Whitney insultor
(SWI) with spin-orbit coupled ultracold atoms in an optical Raman lattice. Four
selected spin states are coupled by carefully designed Raman lasers, to
generate the desired spin-orbit interactions with spacetime inversion symmetry.
We map out a phase diagram with respect to the experimental parameters, where a
large topological phase region exists. We further present two distinct
detection methods to resolve the non-abelian band topology, in both equilibrium
and dynamical ways. The detection relies on the spin textures extracted from
the time-of-flight imaging, showing the tomographic signatures in the ground
states and long-time averaged patterns on certain submanifold via a
bulk-surface duality. Our work paves a realistic way to explore novel real
topology with quantum matters.

<i>Chongwu Xie, Konghao Sun, Kang-Da Wu, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo, Wei Yi, Guo-Yong Xiang</i>
<p>Dissipative Rydberg gases are an outstanding platform for the investigation
of many-body quantum open systems. Despite the wealth of existing studies, the
non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative Rydberg gases are rarely examined or
harnessed from the perspective of non-Hermitian physics, which is but intrinsic
to open systems. Here we report the experimental observation of a chiral
switching between many-body steady states in a dissipative thermal Rydberg
vapor, where the interplay of many-body effects and non-Hermiticity plays a key
role. Specifically, as the parameters are adiabatically varied around a closed
contour, depending on the chirality of the parameter modulation, the Rydberg
vapor can change between two collective steady states with distinct Rydberg
excitations and optical transmissions. Adopting a mean-field description, we
reveal that both the existence of the bistable steady states and chiral
dynamics derive from an exceptional structure in the parameter space, where
multiple steady states of the many-body Liouvillian superoperator coalesce. We
demonstrate that both the exceptional structure and the resulting
state-switching dynamics are tunable through microwave dressing and temperature
variations, confirming their reliance on the many-body dissipative nature of
the Rydberg vapor.

<h3>A tale of two pairs: on the origin of the pseudogap end point in the  high-T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02785" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02785</a>
<br>
<i>Jianhua Yang, Tao Li</i>
<p>There are two seemingly unrelated puzzles about the cuprate superconductors.
The first puzzle concerns the strong non-BCS behavior around $x_{c}$, the end
point of the superconducting dome on the overdoped side, where the cuparte is
believed to be well described by the fermi liquid theory. This is the most
evident in the observed $\rho_{s}(0)-T_{c}$ scaling and the large amount of
uncondensed optical spectral weight at low energy. The second puzzle concerns
the remarkable robustness of the d-wave pairing against the inevitable disorder
effect in such a doped system, which is also totally unexpected from the
conventional BCS picture. Here we show that these two puzzles are deeply
connected to the origin of a third puzzle about the cuprate superconductors,
namely, the mysterious quantum critical behavior observed around $x^{*}$, the
so called pseudogap end point. Through a systematic variational optimization of
the disordered 2D $t-J$ model from the resonating valence bond(RVB)
perspective, we find that the d-wave pairing in this model is remarkably more
robust against the disorder effect than that in a conventional d-wave BCS
superconductor. We find that such remarkable robustness can be attributed to
the spin-charge separation mechanism in the RVB picture, through which the
d-wave RVB pairing of the charge neutral spinons becomes essentially immune to
the impurity potential. We propose that there exists a Mott transition at
$x^{*}$, where the RVB pairing in the underdoped regime is transmuted into the
increasingly more BCS-like pairing for $x>x^{*}$, whose increasing fragility
against the disorder effect leads to the non-BCS behavior and the ultimate
suppression of superconductivity around $x_{c}$.

<h3>Ab initio Investigation of Thermal Transport in Insulators: Unveiling  the Roles of Phonon Renormalization and Higher-Order Anharmonicity</h3>

<i>Soham Mandal, Manish Jain, Prabal K. Maiti</i>
<p>The occurrence of thermal transport phenomena is widespread, exerting a
pivotal influence on the functionality of diverse electronic and
thermo-electric energy-conversion devices. The traditional first-principles
theory governing the thermal and thermodynamic characteristics of insulators
relies on the perturbative treatment of interatomic potential and ad-hoc
displacement of atoms within supercells. However, the limitations of these
approaches for highly anharmonic and weakly bonded materials, along with
discrepancies arising from not considering explicit finite temperature effects,
highlight the necessity for a well-defined quasiparticle approach to the
lattice vibrations. To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive
numerical framework in this study, designed to compute the thermal and
thermodynamic characteristics of crystalline semiconductors and insulators. The
self-consistent phonon renormalization method we have devised reveals phonons
as quasiparticles, diverging from their conventional characterization as bare
normal modes of lattice vibration. The extension of the renormalization impact
to interatomic force constants (IFCs) of third and fourth orders is also
integrated and demonstrated. For the comprehensive physical insights, we
employed an iterative solution of the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation
(PBTE) to determine thermal conductivity and carry out Helmholtz free energy
calculations, encompassing anharmonicity effects up to the fourth order. In
this study, we utilize our numerical framework to showcase its applicability
through an examination of phonon dispersion, phonon linewidth, anharmonic
phonon scattering, and temperature-dependent lattice thermal conductivity in
both highly anharmonic materials (NaCl and AgI) and weakly anharmonic materials
(cBN and 3C-SiC).

<h3>Convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) correlated variational  wave function for the Hubbard model on a square lattice: Mott metal-insulator  transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02794" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02794</a>
<br>
<i>Karthik V., Amal Medhi</i>
<p>We use a convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) neural network to
construct a variational wave function (WF) for the Hubbard model on a square
lattice and study it using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. In the
wave function, the CRBM acts as a correlation factor to a mean-field BCS state.
The number of variational parameters in the WF does not grow automatically with
the lattice size and it is computationally much more efficient compared to
other neural network based WFs. We find that in the intermediate to strong
coupling regime of the model at half-filling, the wave function outperforms
even the highly accurate long range backflow-Jastrow correlated wave function.
Using the WF, we study the ground state of the half-filled model as a function
of onsite Coulomb repulsion $U$. We consider two cases for the
next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter, e.g., $t'=0$ as well as a frustrated
model case with $t'\neq 0$. By examining several quantities, e.g., double
occupancy, charge gap, momentum distribution, and spin-spin correlations, we
find that the weekly correlated phase in both cases is paramagnetic metallic
(PM). As $U$ is increased, the system undergoes a first-order Mott transition
to an insulating state at a critical $U_c$, the value of which depends upon
$t'$. The Mott state in both cases is spin gapped with long range
antiferromagnetic (AF) order. Remarkably, the AF order emerges spontaneously
from the wave function which does not have any explicitly broken symmetry in
it. Apart from some quantitative differences in the results for the two values
of $t'$, we find some interesting qualitative differences in the way the Mott
transition takes place in the two cases.

<h3>Orientation-dependent Josephson effect in spin-singlet  superconductor/altermagnet/spin-triplet superconductor junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>Qiang Cheng, Qing-Feng Sun</i>
<p>We study the Josephson effect in the spin-singlet
superconductor/altermagnet/spin-triplet superconductor junctions using the
Green's function method. The current-phase difference relationships in the
junctions strongly depend on the orientation of altermagnet and the types of
the Cooper pairs. For the orientation angle equal to odd multiples of $\pi/4$,
the current-phase difference relationships are of the $\sin{2\phi}$ type, which
are irrespective of the pairing wave functions in superconductors. For the
other orientation angles, the emergence of the lowest order current becomes
possible and its form, $\sin\phi$ or $\cos\phi$, depends on the pairing wave
functions in superconductors. The $\phi_{0}$ phase and the $0$-$\pi$ transition
can be realized in our junctions due to the appearance of the lowest order
current. The selection rules for the lowest order current are presented. The
symmetric relations satisfied by the current-phase difference relationships are
analyzed through considering the transformations of the junctions under the
mirror reflection, the time-reversal and the spin rotation operations. Our
results not only provide a method to detect the intrinsic spin-triplet
superconductivity but also possess application values in the design of the
field-free quantum devices.

<i>Alexander Sattler, Maria Daghofer</i>
<p>Both the Haldane spin chain and a topologically dimerized chain feature
topologically protected edge states that are expected to be robust against some
kind of noise. To elucidate whether it might be feasible to create such edge
states in a controlled manner in solid states environments, e.g. as spin chains
on surfaces, we investigate their robustness with respect to long-range
coupling, anisotropies and finite chain length. The theoretical investigation
is based on an alternating Heisenberg spin chain with spin-$1/2$, which is
investigated using exact diagonalization. We find that dimerized chains and
Haldane chains have robustness against long-range coupling and anisotropies. In
particular, dimerized spin chains are significantly more robust than Haldane
chains.

<h3>Interconnected Renormalization of Hubbard Bands and Green's Function  Zeros in Mott Insulators Induced by Strong Magnetic Fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02814" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02814</a>
<br>
<i>Evgeny A. Stepanov, Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Niklas Wagner, Giorgio Sangiovanni</i>
<p>We analyze the role of spatial electronic correlations and, in particular, of
the magnetic fluctuations in Mott insulators. A half-filled Hubbard model is
solved at large strength of the repulsion $U$ on a two-dimensional square
lattice using an advanced diagrammatic non-perturbative approach capable of
going beyond Hartree-Fock and single-site dynamical mean-field theories. We
show that at high temperatures the magnetic fluctuations are weak, and the
electronic self-energy of the system is mainly local and is well reproduced by
the atomic (Hubbard-I) approximation. Lowering the temperature toward the
low-temperature magnetically ordered phase, the non-locality of the self-energy
becomes crucial in determining the dispersion of the Hubbard bands and of the
Green's function zeros. We therefore establish a precise link between the
Luttinger surface and the momentum-structure of the Hubbard bands.

<p>The demand for lithium, as well as other critical resources, needed for
electrochemical energy storage is expected to grow significantly in the future.
Slags obtained from pyrometallurgical recycling represent a promising resource
of valuable materials, among them lithium and rare earth elements found in
artificial minerals particulate phases. This study investigates the flotation
separation of engineered artificial minerals (EnAMs) in slags, such as lithium
aluminate and gehlenite as valuable and gangue phases, respectively. Flotation
experiments are carried out in a Partridge-Smith cell using oleic acid (OA) as
a benchmark surfactant. Particle characterization is performed using SEM-based
Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA), which provides particle discrete
information. From this information, bivariate Tromp functions based on
non-parametric kernel density estimation are computed to characterize the
separation behavior with respect to particle descriptors. This approach enables
investigating the influence of particle size and shape on separation behavior
of EnAMs. Furthermore, these results allow for the optimization of flotation
experiments for enriching Li-bearing EnAMs.

<br>
<i>Sk Siddik, Golam Ali Sekh</i>
<p>We consider Shannon entropy, Fisher information, R\'enyi entropy, and Tsallis
entropy to study the transition from localized phase to droplet phase in
Bose-Einstein condensates. Based on an effective Gross-Pitaevskii equation with
Lee-Huang-Yang correction, we calculate density distributions both in localized
and the droplet phases and show that the entropy measures can efficiently
detect the transition from localized to droplet phase. We find that the Shannon
entropies in coordinate space increase both in localized and droplet phases.
The increase of entropy in droplet phase is abrupt while it is gradual in
localized phase. We observe an opposite trend in the case of Fisher
information. These results are found to be consistent with the R\'enyi and
Tsallis entropic measures.

<h3>Amorphous quantum magnets in a two-dimensional Rydberg atom array</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02852" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02852</a>
<br>
<i>Sergi Julià-Farré, Joseph Vovrosh, Alexandre Dauphin</i>
<p>Amorphous solids, i.e., systems which feature well-defined short-range
properties but lack long-range order, constitute an important research topic in
condensed matter. While their microscopic structure is known to differ from
their crystalline counterpart, there are still many open questions concerning
the emergent collective behavior in amorphous materials. This is particularly
the case in the quantum regime, where the numerical simulations are extremely
challenging. In this article, we instead propose to explore amorphous quantum
magnets with an analog quantum simulator. To this end, we first present an
algorithm to generate amorphous quantum magnets, suitable for Rydberg
simulators of the Ising model. Subsequently, we use semiclassical approaches to
get a preliminary insight of the physics of the model. In particular, we
calculate mean-field phase diagrams, and use the linear-spin-wave theory to
study localization properties and dynamical structure factors of the
excitations. Finally, we outline an experimental proposal based on Rydberg
atoms in programmable tweezer arrays, thus opening the road towards the study
of amorphous quantum magnets in regimes difficult to simulate classically.

<h3>A classical density functional theory for solvation across length scales</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02873</a>
<br>
<i>Anna T. Bui, Stephen J. Cox</i>
<p>A central aim of multiscale modeling is to use results from the Schr\"odinger
Equation to predict phenomenology on length scales that far exceed those of
typical molecular correlations. In this work, we present a new approach rooted
in classical density functional theory (cDFT) that allows us to accurately
describe the solvation of apolar solutes across length scales. Our approach
builds on the Lum, Chandler and Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity [J. Phys.
Chem. B 103, 4570 (1999)] by constructing a free energy functional that uses a
slowly-varying component of the density field as a reference. From a practical
viewpoint, the theory we present is numerically simpler and generalizes to
solutes with soft-core repulsion more easily than LCW theory. Furthermore, we
also provide two important conceptual insights. First, the coarse-graining of
the density field emerges naturally and justifies a coarse-graining length much
smaller than the molecular diameter of water. Second, by assessing the local
compressibility and its critical scaling behavior, we demonstrate that our
LCW-style cDFT approach contains the physics of critical drying, which has been
emphasized as an essential aspect of hydrophobicity by recent theories. As our
theory is parameterized on the two-body direct correlation function of the
uniform fluid and the liquid-vapor surface tension, it straightforwardly
captures the temperature dependence of solvation. Moreover, we use our theory
to describe solvation at a first-principles level, on length scales that vastly
exceed what is accessible to molecular simulations.

<h3>Entangled multiplets, asymmetry, and quantum Mpemba effect in  dissipative systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02918</a>
<br>
<i>Fabio Caceffo, Sara Murciano, Vincenzo Alba</i>
<p>Recently, the entanglement asymmetry emerged as an informative tool to
understand dynamical symmetry restoration in out-of-equilibrium quantum
many-body systems after a quantum quench. For integrable systems the asymmetry
can be understood in the space-time scaling limit via the quasiparticle
picture, as it was pointed out in Ref. [1]. However, a quasiparticle picture
for quantum quenches from generic initial states was still lacking. Here we
conjecture a full-fledged quasiparticle picture for the charged moments of the
reduced density matrix, which are the main ingredients to construct the
asymmetry. Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an
arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin
chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional
stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous
derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in
[2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained
within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a
general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times.
Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and
loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate
the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of
dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics
that does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of
the condition for the QME.

<h3>Femtosecond trimer quench cycled at megahertz rates in the  unconventional charge-density wave material $1\textit{T'}-\text{TaTe}_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02931</a>

<i>Till Domröse, Claus Ropers</i>
<p>Ultrafast optical switching of materials properties is of great relevance
both for future technological applications as well as gaining fundamental
physical insights to microscopic couplings and nonequilibrium phenomena.
Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) combine photo-sensitivity with strong
correlations, furthering rich phase diagrams and enhanced tunability. Owing to
its chemical composition, $1\textit{T'}-\text{TaTe}_2$ exhibits an
electronically and structurally unique set of charge-density waves (CDWs),
featuring increased conductivity and a reduced prominence of amplitude modes.
Compared to other charge-ordered TMDCs, only very few studies addressed the
ultrafast response of this material to optical excitation. In particular, the
question whether such unconventional properties translate to unusual quench
dynamics remains largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the structural
dynamics in $1\textit{T'}-\text{TaTe}_2$ by means of ultrafast nanobeam
electron diffraction. The experiments are carried out with a tailored sample
design that allows for excitation at 2$\,$MHz repetition rate, higher than any
structural phase transformation probed thus far. Harnessing the enhanced
resolution and sensitivity of this approach, we reveal a strongly directional
cooperative atomic motion during the one-dimensional quench of the
low-temperature trimer lattice. These dynamics are completed within less than
500$\,$fs, substantially faster than reported previously. In striking contrast,
the periodic lattice distortion of the room-temperature phase is unusually
robust against high-density electronic excitation. In conjunction with the
known sensitivity of $1\textit{T'}-\text{TaTe}_2$ to chemical doping, we thus
expect the material to serve as a versatile platform for tunable structural
control by optical stimuli.

<h3>Bidirectional Zigzag Growth from Clusters of Active Colloidal Shakers</h3>

<br>
<i>Gaspard Junot, Andrés Javier Manzano González, Pietro Tierno</i>
<p>Driven or self-propelling particles moving in viscoelastic fluids recently
emerge as novel class of active systems showing a complex yet rich set of
phenomena due to the non-Newtonian nature of the dispersing medium. Here we
investigate the one-dimensional growth of clusters made of active colloidal
shakers, which are realized by oscillating magnetic rotors dispersed within a
viscoelastic fluid and at different concentration of the dissolved polymer.
These magnetic particles when actuated by an oscillating field display a flow
profile similar to that of a shaker force dipole, i.e. without any net
propulsion. We design a protocol to assemble clusters of colloidal shakers and
induce their controlled expansion into elongated zigzag structures. We observe
a power law growth of the mean chain length and use theoretical arguments to
explain the measured $1/3$ exponent. These arguments agree well with both
experiments and particle based numerical simulations.

<h3>Large-scale characterization of Cu2O monocrystals via Rydberg excitons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02948</a>
<br>
<i>Kerwan Morin, Delphine Lagarde, Angélique Gillet, Xavier Marie, Thomas Boulier</i>
<p>Rydberg states of excitons can reach microns in size and require extremely
pure crystals. We introduce an experimental method for the rapid and
spatially-resolved characterization of Rydberg excitons in copper oxide (Cu2O)
with sub-micron resolution over large zones. Our approach involves illuminating
and imaging the entire sample on a camera to realize a spatially-resolved
version of resonant absorption spectroscopy, without any mobile part. This
yields spatial maps of Rydberg exciton properties, including their energy,
linewidth and peak absorption, providing a comprehensive quality assessment of
the entire sample in a single shot. Furthermore, by imaging the sample
photoluminescence over the same zone, we establish a strong relationship
between the spectral quality map and the photoluminescence map of charged
oxygen vacancies. This results in an independent, luminescence-based quality
map that closely matches the results obtained through resonant spectroscopy.
Our findings reveal that Rydberg excitons in natural Cu2O crystals are
predominantly influenced by optically-active charged oxygen vacancies, which
can be easily mapped. Together, these two complementary methods provide
valuable insights into Cu2O crystal properties.

<h3>Controlling flow patterns and topology in active emulsions</h3>

<br>
<i>Giuseppe Negro, Louise C. Head, Livio N. Carenza, Tyler N. Shendruk, Davide Marenduzzo, Giuseppe Gonnella, Adriano Tiribocchi</i>
<p>Active emulsions and liquid crystalline shells are intriguing and
experimentally realisable types of topological matter. Here we numerically
study the morphology and spatiotemporal dynamics of a double emulsion, where
one or two passive small droplets are embedded in a larger active droplet. We
find activity introduces a variety of rich and nontrivial nonequilibrium states
in the system. First, a double emulsion with a single active droplet becomes
self-motile, and there is a transition between translational and rotational
motion: both of these regimes remain defect-free, hence topologically trivial.
Second, a pair of particles nucleate one or more disclination loops, with
conformational dynamics resembling a rotor or chaotic oscillator, accessed by
tuning activity. In the first state a single, topologically charged,
disclination loop powers the rotation. In the latter state, this disclination
stretches and writhes in 3D, continuously undergoing recombination to yield an
example of an active living polymer. These emulsions can be self-assembled in
the lab, and provide a pathway to form flow and topology patterns in active
matter in a controllable way, as opposed to bulk systems that typically yield
active turbulence.

<h3>Thermal expansion and temperature dependence of Raman modes in epitaxial  layers of Ge and Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$</h3>

<i>Agnieszka Anna Corley-Wiciak, Diana Ryzhak, Marvin Hartwig Zoellner, Costanza Lucia Manganelli, Omar Concepción, Oliver Skibitzki, Detlev Grützmacher, Dan Buca, Giovanni Capellini, Davide Spirito</i>
<p>Temperature dependence of vibrational modes in semiconductors depends on
lattice thermal expansion and anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering. Evaluating
the two contributions from experimental data is not straightforward, especially
for epitaxial layers that present mechanical deformation and anisotropic
lattice expansion. In this work, a temperature-dependent Raman study in
epitaxial Ge and Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ layers is presented. A model is introduced
for the Raman mode energy shift as a function of temperature, comprising
thermal expansion of the strained lattice and anharmonic corrections. With
support of x-ray diffraction, the model is calibrated on experimental data of
epitaxial Ge grown on Si and Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ grown on Ge/Si, finding that
the main difference between bulk and epitaxial layers is related to the
anisotropic lattice expansion. The phonon anharmonicity and other parameters do
not depend on dislocation defect density (in the range $7\cdot 10^6$ - $4\cdot
10^8$ cm$^{-2}$) nor on alloy composition in the range 5-14 at.%. The
strain-shift coefficient for the main model of Ge and for the Ge-Ge vibrational
mode of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ is weakly dependent on temperature and is around
-500 cm$^{-1}$. In Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$, the composition-shift coefficient
amounts to -100 cm$^{-1}$, independent of temperature and strain.

<h3>Deposition and photoluminescence of zinc gallium oxide thin films with  varied stoichiometry made by reactive magnetron co-sputtering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03000" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03000</a>
<br>
<i>Martins Zubkins, Edvards Strods, Viktors Vibornijs, Anatolijs Sarakovskis, Ramūnas Nedzinskas, Reinis Ignatans, Edgars Butanovs, Juris Purans, Andris Azens</i>
<p>This paper reports on the deposition and photoluminescence of amorphous and
crystalline thin films of zinc gallium oxide with Ga:Zn atomic ratio varied
between 0.3 and 5.7. The films are prepared by reactive direct current
magnetron co-sputtering from liquid/solid gallium/zinc targets onto fused
quartz substrates; the temperature of the substrate is varied from room
temperature (RT) to 800{\deg}C. The sputtering process is effectively
controlled by fixing the sputtering power of one of the targets and controlling
the power of the other target by plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The
method, in conjunction with oxygen flow adjustment, enables the production of
near-stoichiometric films at any temperature used. The composition analysis
suggests a few at.% oxygen deficiency in the films. The resulting deposition
rate is at least an order of magnitude higher compared to the commonly used
radio-frequency sputtering from a ceramic ZnO:Ga2O3 target. Deposited onto
unheated substrates, the films with Ga:Zn {\approx} 2 are X-ray amorphous.
Well-defined X-ray diffraction peaks of spinel ZnGa2O4 start to appear at a
substrate temperature of 300{\deg}C. The surface of the as-deposited films is
dense and exhibits a fine-featured structure observed in electron microscopy
images. Increasing the deposition temperature from RT to 800{\deg}C eliminates
defects and improves crystallinity, which for the films with Ga:Zn ratio close
to 2 results in an increase in the optical band gap from 4.6 eV to 5.1 eV. Room
temperature photoluminescence established the main peak at 3.1 eV (400 nm); a
similar peak in Ga2O3 is ascribed to oxygen-vacancy related transitions. A
prominent feature around 2.9 eV (428 nm) is attributed to self-activation
center of the octahedral Ga-O groups in the spinel lattice of ZnGa2O4. It was
found that photoluminescence from ZnGa2O4 depends significantly on the ratio
Ga:Zn.

<i>Giuseppe Meneghini, Samuel Brem, Ermin Malic</i>
<p>Twisted van der Waals heterostructures show an intriguing interface exciton
physics including hybridization effects and emergence of moir\'e potentials.
Recent experiments have revealed that moir\'e-trapped excitons exhibit a
remarkable dynamics, where excited states show lifetimes that are several
orders of magnitude longer than those in monolayers. The origin of this
behaviour is still under debate. Based on a microscopic many-particle approach,
we investigate the phonon-driven relaxation cascade of non-equilibrium moir\'e
excitons in the exemplary MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We track the
exciton relaxation pathway across different moir\'e mini-bands and identify the
phonon-scattering channels assisting the spatial redistribution of excitons
into low-energy pockets of the moir\'e potential. We unravel a phonon
bottleneck in the flat band structure at low twist angles preventing excitons
to fully thermalize into the lowest state explaining the measured enhanced
emission intensity of excited moir\'e excitons. Overall, our work provides
important insights into exciton relaxation dynamics in flatband exciton
materials.

<p>Excitations between localized 3d states of transition metal ions within
crystalline solids, commonly known as d-d transitions, play a pivotal role in
diverse phenomena across solid state physics, materials science, and chemistry.
These transitions contribute to the coloration in transition metal oxides,
catalytic processes on oxide surfaces, and high-temperature superconductivity.
They also couple optical excitation to quantized collective phenomena such as
phonons and magnons in magnetic systems. Until now, an experimental method to
unravel the complex quasiparticle dynamics associated with d-d transitions has
remained elusive. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that d-d transitions can
be distinctly traced in momentum space and time using time- and angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES). Through this approach, we can assign
specific momentum-dependent characteristics and elucidate the decay mechanisms
of specific d-d transitions in FePS$_{3}$, a two-dimensional van der Waals
antiferromagnet with a rich array of quantum phenomena stemming from d-d
transitions. This study pioneers the use of ARPES in probing the dynamics of
d-d transitions across a wide spectrum of solid-state systems.

<h3>Elementary vibrational model for thermal conductivity of Lennard-Jones  fluids: Applicability domain and accuracy level</h3>

<br>
<i>S. A. Khrapak, A. G. Khrapak</i>
<p>Exact mechanisms of thermal conductivity in liquids are not well understood,
despite rich research history. A vibrational model of energy transfer in dense
simple liquids with soft pairwise interactions seems adequate to partially fill
this gap. The purpose of the present paper is to define its applicability
domain and to demonstrate how well it works within the identified applicability
domain in the important case of the Lennard-Jones model system. The existing
results from molecular dynamics simulations are used for this purpose.
Additionally, we show that a freezing density scaling approach represents a
very powerful tool to estimate the thermal conductivity coefficient across
essentially the entire gas-liquid region of the phase diagram, including
metastable regions. A simple practical expression serving this purpose is
proposed.

<h3>Circular motion of non-collinear spin textures in Corbino disks:  Dynamics of Néel- versus Bloch-type skyrmions and skyrmioniums</h3>

<br>
<i>Ismael Ribeiro de Assis, Ingrid Mertig, Börge Göbel</i>
<p>Magnetic skyrmions are nano-scale magnetic whirls that can be driven by
currents via spin torques. They are promising candidates for spintronic devices
such as the racetrack memory, where a motion along the uniform current is
typically desired. However, in Corbino disks, the goal is to achieve a circular
motion, perpendicular to the radially applied current. As we show, based on
analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations, Bloch skyrmions engage
in a circular motion with frequencies in the MHz range when driven by
spin-orbit torques. In contrast, N\'eel skyrmions get stuck at the edges of the
disk. Our analysis reveals that the antagonistic dynamics between Bloch- and
N\'eel-type magnetic textures arise from their helicity. Furthermore, we find
that skyrmioniums, which are topologically trivial variations of skyrmions,
move even faster and allow an increase in the current density without being
pushed toward the edges of the disk. When driven by spin-transfer torques
instead, Bloch and N\'eel skyrmions no longer exhibit different dynamics.
Instead, they move along a circular trajectory due to the skyrmion Hall effect
caused by their topological charge. Consequently, the topologically trivial
skyrmioniums inevitably become trapped at the disk edge in this scenario. To
provide a comprehensive understanding, our study also examines currents applied
tangentially, further enriching our insights into skyrmion dynamics and
appropriate current injection methods for skyrmion-based devices.

explore the energy landscape, its associated curvatures, and the fundamental

<h3>Elementary processes in dilatational plasticity of glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03044" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03044</a>
<br>
<i>Avraham Moriel, David Richard, Edan Lerner, Eran Bouchbinder</i>
<p>Materials typically fail under complex stress states, essentially involving
dilatational (volumetric) components that eventually lead to material
decohesion/separation. It is therefore important to understand dilatational
irreversible deformation -- i.e., dilatational plasticity -- en route to
failure. In the context of glasses, much focus has been given to shear
(volume-preserving) plasticity, both in terms of the stress states considered
and the corresponding material response. Here, using a recently-developed
methodology and extensive computer simulations, we shed basic light on the
elementary processes mediating dilatational plasticity in glasses. We show that
plastic instabilities, corresponding to singularities of the glass Hessian,
generically feature both dilatational and shear irreversible strain components.
The relative magnitude and statistics of the strain components depend both on
the symmetry of the driving stress (e.g., shear vs.~hydrostatic tension) and on
the cohesive (attractive) part of the interatomic interaction. We further show
that the tensorial shear component of the plastic strain is generally
non-planar and also extract the characteristic volume of plastic instabilities.
Elucidating the fundamental properties of the elementary micro-mechanical
building blocks of plasticity in glasses sets the stage for addressing
larger-scale, collective phenomena in dilatational plasticity such as
topological changes in the form of cavitation and ductile-to-brittle
transitions. As a first step in this direction, we show that the elastic moduli
markedly soften during dilatational plastic deformation approaching cavitation.

<p>Straintronics involves the manipulation and regulation of the electronic
characteristics of 2D materials through the use of macro- and nano-scale strain
engineering. In this study, we utilized an atomic force microscope (AFM)
coupled with an optical system to perform indentation measurements and
tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL), allowing us to extract the local optical
response of a suspended monolayer membrane of ternary WSSe at various levels of
deformation, up to strains of 10%. The photoluminescence signal is modelled
considering the deformation, stress distribution and strain dependence of the
WSSe band structure. We observe an additional TEPL signal that exhibits
significant variation under strain, with 64 meV per percent of elongation. This
peak is linked to the highly strained 2D material lying right underneath the
tip. We discuss the amplification of the signal and its relation to the
excitonic funnelling effect in a more comprehensive model. We will also compare
the diffusion caused by Auger recombination against the radiative excitonic
decay. We use TEPL to examine and comprehend the local physics of 2D
semi-conducting materials subjected to extreme mechanical strain. Chemical
vapour deposition-fabricated 2D ternaries possess high strain resistance,
comparable to the benchmark MoS2, and a high Young's modulus of 273 GPa.

<p>We study two mobile bosonic impurities immersed in a one-dimensional optical
lattice and interacting with a bosonic bath. We employ the exact
diagonalization method for small periodic lattices to study stationary
properties and dynamics. We consider the branch of repulsive interactions that
induce the formation of bound impurities, akin to the bipolaron problem. A
comprehensive study of ground-state and low-energy properties is presented,
including the characterization of the critical strength for the formation of
bound impurities. We also study the dynamics induced after an
interaction-quench to examine the stability of the bound impurities. We reveal
that after large interaction quenches from strong to weak interactions the
system can show large oscillations over time with revivals of the dimer states.
We find that the oscillations are driven by selected eigenstates with
phase-separated configurations.

<p>The tunability of magnons enables their interaction with various other
quantum excitations, including photons, paving the route for novel hybrid
quantum systems. Here, we study magnon-photon coupling using a high-quality
factor split-ring resonator and single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG)
spheres at room temperature. We investigate the dependence of the coupling
strength on the size of the sphere and find that the coupling is stronger for
spheres with a larger diameter as predicted by theory. Furthermore, we
demonstrate strong magnon-photon coupling by varying the position of the YIG
sphere within the resonator. Our experimental results reveal the expected
correlation between the coupling strength and the rf magnetic field. These
findings demonstrate the control of coherent magnon-photon coupling through the
theoretically predicted square-root dependence on the spin density in the
ferromagnetic medium and the magnetic dipolar interaction in a planar
resonator.

<p>Classical spin liquids (CSLs) have proved to be a fruitful setting for the
emergence of exotic gauge theories. Vacancy clusters in CSLs can introduce
gauge charges into the system, and the resulting behavior in turn reveals the
nature of the underlying theory. We study these effects for a series of CSLs on
the honeycomb lattice. We find that dilution leads to the emergence of
effective free spins with tuneable, and generally irrational, size. For a
specific higher-rank CSL, described by a symmetric tensor gauge fields,
dilution produces non-decaying spin textures with a characteristic quadrupolar
angular structure, and infinite-ranged interactions between dilution clusters.

<h3>Designing topology and fractionalization in narrow gap semiconductor  films via electrostatic engineering</h3>

<p>We show that topological flat minibands can be engineered in a class of
narrow gap semiconductor films using only an external electrostatic
superlattice potential. We demonstrate that, for realistic material parameters,
these bands are capable of hosting correlated topological phases such as
integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states and composite Fermi liquid
phases at zero magnetic field. Our results provide a path towards the
realization of fractionalized topological states in a broad range of materials.

<h3>Scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray photoemission studies of NdNiO2  infinite-layer nickelates films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03143" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03143</a>
<br>
<i>Martando Rath, Yu Chen, Guillaume Krieger, H. Sahib, Daniele Preziosi, Marco Salluzzo</i>
<p>We report scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and x-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on uncapped and SrTiO3 (STO) capped NdNiO2
realized by pulsed-laser deposition and topotactic reduction process. We find
that untreated NdNiO2 surfaces are insulating and contain Ni mostly in a
nominal Ni2+ oxidation state. Room temperature STM shows signatures of a
striped-like topographic pattern, possibly compatible with recent reports of
ordered oxygen vacancies in uncapped nickelates due to incomplete oxygen
de-intercalation of the upper layers. A metallic surface and a full Ni1+
oxidation state is recovered by ultra high vacuum annealing at 250 C, as shown
by STM and XPS. STO-capped NdNiO2 films, on the other hand, show Ni mostly in
Ni1+ configuration, but Nd 3d5/2 core level spectra have a relevant
contribution from ligand 4f 4L states, suggesting the formation of a NdTiNiOx
layer at the interface with the STO. By in situ unit-cell by unit-cell Ar-ion
sputtering removal of the STO capping and of the non stoichiometric interface
layer, we were able to address the surface electronic properties of these
samples, as shown by high resolution valence band photoemission spectroscopy.
The results provide insights in the properties of infinite-layer NdNiO2 thin
films prepared by the CaH2 topotactic reduction of perovskite NdNiO3 and
suggest methods to improve their surface quality.

<h3>Nitrogen-polar growth of AlN on vicinal (0001) sapphire by MOVPE</h3>

<br>
<i>Pietro Pampili, Markus Pristovsek</i>
<p>We report about metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy of smooth nitrogen-polar
AlN templates on vicinal (0001) sapphire substrates. The influence of V/III
ratio, growth temperature, growth rate, as well as sapphire-nitridation time
and temperature were studied. With 4{\deg} offcut sapphire, step-flow growth
was possible only with V/III ratios below 2. However, optimal V/III ratio
required precise adjustment, possibly dependent on reactor history and
geometry. A rather narrow temperature window of less than 40{\deg}C existed for
smooth surface morphology. Reducing the temperature affected adatom mobility,
eventually disrupting step-flow growth; increasing the temperature favoured the
formation of high-aspect-ratio defects on the epilayer. A low thermal-budget
nitridation step with a short nitridation time of 15 s proved to be effective
in controlling polarity without inducing excessive surface damage on the
sapphire substrate. Growth rate also influenced surface morphology, with an
increase in RMS roughness and step-bouncing for faster growths; however, at
growth rates of 1.4 ${\mu}$m/h or higher step-flow growth could no longer form.
Finally, we developed a V/III ratio fine-tuning procedure, whereby the
reactor-specific value that induces optimal growth is inferred by growth-rate
variations. With this method, N polar AlN templates with sub-nanometre RMS
roughness were demonstrated for both 4{\deg} and 2{\deg} offcut sapphire
substrates.

<h3>Experiment-driven atomistic materials modeling: A case study combining  XPS and ML potentials to infer the structure of oxygen-rich amorphous carbon</h3>

<p>An important yet challenging aspect of atomistic materials modeling is
reconciling experimental and computational results. Conventional approaches
involve generating numerous configurations through molecular dynamics or Monte
Carlo structure optimization and selecting the one with the closest match to
experiment. However, this inefficient process is not guaranteed to succeed. We
introduce a general method to combine atomistic machine learning (ML) with
experimental observables that produces atomistic structures compatible with
experiment by design. We use this approach in combination with grand-canonical
Monte Carlo within a modified Hamiltonian formalism, to generate configurations
that agree with experimental data and are chemically sound (low in energy). We
apply our approach to understand the atomistic structure of oxygenated
amorphous carbon (a-CO$_{x}$), an intriguing carbon-based material, to answer
the question of how much oxygen can be added to carbon before it fully
decomposes into CO and CO$_2$. Utilizing an ML-based X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) model trained from $GW$ and density functional theory (DFT)
data, in conjunction with an ML interatomic potential, we identify a-CO$_{x}$
structures compliant with experimental XPS predictions that are also
energetically favorable with respect to DFT. Employing a network analysis, we
accurately deconvolve the XPS spectrum into motif contributions, both revealing
the inaccuracies inherent to experimental XPS interpretation and granting us
atomistic insight into the structure of a-CO$_{x}$. This method generalizes to
multiple experimental observables and allows for the elucidation of the
atomistic structure of materials directly from experimental data, thereby
enabling experiment-driven materials modeling with a degree of realism
previously out of reach.

<h3>Alternate cleavage structure and electronic inhomogeneity in Ca-doped  YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$</h3>

<p>YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has favorable macroscopic superconducting
properties of $T_\mathrm{c}$ up to 93 K and $H_{c2}$ up to 150 T. However, its
nanoscale electronic structure remains mysterious because bulk-like electronic
properties are not preserved near the surface of cleaved samples for easy
access by local or surface-sensitive probes. It has been hypothesized that
Ca-doping at the Y site could induce an alternate cleavage plane that mitigates
this issue. We use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study both Ca-free
and 10% Ca-doped YBCO, and find that the Ca-doped samples do indeed cleave on
an alternate plane, yielding a spatially-disordered partial (Y,Ca) layer. Our
density functional theory calculations support the increased likelihood of this
new cleavage plane in Ca-doped YBCO. On this surface, we image a
superconducting gap with average value 24 $\pm$ 3 meV and characteristic length
scale 1-2 nm, similar to Bi-based high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprates, but the first
map of gap inhomogeneity in the YBCO family.

<h3>Phonon and exciton temperature-dependent properties of twisted MoS$_2$</h3>

<p>In the present work, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies were used to
study the dynamics of phonons and different excitons of MoS$_2$ bilayer under a
rotation of 29$^{\circ}$ dependent of the temperature. The twisted bilayer
(T-2L) of MoS$_2$ was obtained through mechanical exfoliation, and subsequently
rotated using a dimethyl polysiloxane (PDMS) substrate and deterministic
transferred to a SiO$_2$ substrate. The Raman spectrum of the twisted bilayer
presents three peaks E$'$ (386 cm$^{-1}$), A$'_{1}$ (405 cm$^{-1}$) and an
FA$'$ peak at approximately 409 cm$^{-1}$ linked to the A$'_{1}$ mode, which is
attributed to a Moir\'e pattern phonon. Both modes (A$'_{1}$ and FA$'$) are
dependent of light polarization in a way that demonstrates an effective
coupling between the layers. It was also verified through the Gr\"uneisen
parameter, an increase in the anharmonicity of the mode in the E$'$ plane and a
decrease the same for A$'_{1}$. In the PL measurements, the appearance of an
exciton in T-2L was verified, which generated a second shoulder measured at
$\approx$1.58 eV attributed to an indirect transition of an I trion. The
interaction between the rotated monolayers of MoS$_{2}$ proved to be an
important parameter for possible fine-tuning of the properties of bilayer
samples.

<h3>Estimating position-dependent and anisotropic diffusivity tensors from  molecular dynamics trajectories: Existing methods and future outlook</h3>

<p>Confinement can substantially alter the physicochemical properties of
materials by breaking translational isotropy and rendering all physical
properties position-dependent. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven
instrumental in characterizing such spatial heterogeneities and probing the
impact of confinement on materials' properties. For static properties, this is
a straightforward task and can be achieved via simple spatial binning. Such an
approach, however, cannot be readily applied to transport coefficients due to
lack of natural extensions of autocorrelations used for their calculation in
the bulk. The prime example of this challenge is diffusivity, which, in the
bulk, can be readily estimated from the particles' mobility statistics, which
satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation. Under confinement, however, such statistics
will follow the Smoluchowski equation, which lacks a closed-form analytical
solution. This brief review explores the rich history of estimating profiles of
the diffusivity tensor from MD simulations and discusses various approximate
methods and algorithms developed for this purpose. Beside discussing heuristic
extensions of bulk methods, we overview more rigorous algorithms, including
kernel-based methods, Bayesian approaches, and operator discretization
techniques. Additionally, we outline methods based on applying biasing
potentials or imposing constraints on tracer particles. Finally, we discuss
approaches that estimate diffusivity from mean first passage time or committor
probability profiles, a conceptual framework originally developed in the
context of collective variable spaces describing rare events in computational
chemistry and biology. In summary, this paper offers a concise survey of
diverse approaches for estimating diffusivity from MD trajectories,
highlighting challenges and opportunities in this area.

<h3>Observation of the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in moiré MoTe2</h3>

<p>Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators are two-dimensional electronic materials
that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have topologically
protected pairs of edge modes of opposite chiralities. To date, experimental
studies have found only integer QSH insulators with counter-propagating
up-spins and down-spins at each edge leading to a quantized conductance
G0=e^2/h. Here we report transport evidence of a fractional QSH insulator in
2.1-degree-twisted bilayer MoTe2, which supports spin-Sz conservation and flat
spin-contrasting Chern bands. At filling factor v = 3 of the moir\'e valence
bands, each edge contributes a conductance 3/2 G0 with zero anomalous Hall
conductivity. The state is likely a time-reversal pair of the even-denominator
3/2-fractional Chern insulators. Further, at v = 2, 4 and 6, we observe a
single, double and triple QSH insulator with each edge contributing a
conductance G0, 2G0 and 3G0, respectively. Our results open up the possibility
of realizing time reversal symmetric non-abelian anyons and other unexpected
topological phases in highly tunable moir\'e materials.

<h3>Mg nanostructures with controlled dominant c-plane or m-plane facets by  DC magnetron sputter deposition</h3>

<p>Magnesium nanostructures find increased use in applications for hydrogen
storage, catalysis, waste treatment, and heat storage to name a few. Currently,
most nanoparticles are made using a chemical synthesis approach, necessitating
the use of organic solvents and yielding material covered in ligands. To apply
these nanoparticles, one has to use them in paints or slurries for coating of
surfaces, which again produces waste. In this communication we explore the
possibilities of making magnesium nanostructures by a physical technique of
magnetron sputtering and to control their crystallographic properties, i.e. the
type of the dominating crystalline faces building up the external surface of
the particle. We show that by applying different process parameters, it is
possible to obtain dominating c-plane, mixed or dominating m-plane
nanostructures. Since the surface-related adsorption processes are strongly
related to the type of the crystalline plane, this report presents a clean,
waste-free and large-scale approach to develop tailored nanostructured Mg
coatings.
