<h3>Entropy production of active particles in underdamped regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02082</a>

The present work investigates the effect of inertia on the entropy production
rate $\Pi$ for all canonical models of active particles, for different
dimensions and the type of confinement. To calculate $\Pi$, the link between
the entropy production and dissipation of heat rate is explored. By analyzing
the Kramers equation in a stationary state, alternative formulations of $\Pi$
are obtained and the virial theorem for active particles is derived. Exact
results are obtained for particles in an unconfined environment and in a
harmonic trap. In both cases, $\Pi$ is independent of temperature. In contrast,
for active particles in 1D box, thermal fluctuations are found to reduce $\Pi$.

<h3>Hydrodynamics of plastic deformations in electronic crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02117" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02117</a>
<br>

We construct a new hydrodynamic framework describing plastic deformations in
electronic crystals. The framework accounts for pinning, phase, and momentum
relaxation effects due to translational disorder, diffusion due to the presence
of interstitials and vacancies, and strain relaxation due to plasticity and
dislocations. We obtain the hydrodynamic mode spectrum and correlation
functions in various regimes in order to identify the signatures of plasticity
in electronic crystal phases. In particular, we show that proliferation of
dislocations de-pins the spatially resolved conductivity until the crystal
melts, after which point a new phase of a pinned electronic liquid emerges. In
addition, the mode spectrum exhibits a competition between pinning and
plasticity effects, with the damping rate of some modes being controlled by
pinning-induced phase relaxation and some by plasticity-induced strain
relaxation. We find that the recently discovered damping-attenuation relation
continues to hold for pinned-induced phase relaxation even in the presence of
plasticity and dislocations. We also comment on various experimental setups
that could probe the effects of plasticity. The framework developed here is
applicable to a large class of physical systems including electronic Wigner
crystals, multicomponent charge density waves, and ordinary crystals.

<h3>Random traction yielding transition in epithelial tissues</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02159</a>
<br>
<i>Aboutaleb Amiri, Charlie Duclut, Frank Jülicher, Marko Popović</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate how randomly oriented cell traction forces lead to
fluidisation in a vertex model of epithelial tissues. We find that the
fluidisation occurs at a critical value of the traction force magnitude $F_c$.
We show that this transition exhibits critical behaviour, similar to the
yielding transition of sheared amorphous solids. However, we find that it
belongs to a different universality class, even though it satisfies the same
scaling relations between critical exponents established in the yielding
transition of sheared amorphous solids. Our work provides a fluidisation
mechanism through active force generation that could be relevant in biological
tissues.

Strongly correlated materials often exhibit an electronic phase separation
(EPS) phenomena whose domain pattern is random in nature. The ability to
control the spatial arrangement of the electronic phases at microscopic scales
is highly desirable for tailoring their macroscopic properties and/or designing
novel electronic devices. Here we report the formation of EPS nanoscale network
in a mono-atomically stacked LaMnO3/CaMnO3/PrMnO3 superlattice grown on SrTiO3
(STO) (001) substrate, which is known to have an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
insulating ground state. The EPS nano-network is a consequence of an internal
strain relaxation triggered by the structural domain formation of the
underlying STO substrate at low temperatures. The same nanoscale network
pattern can be reproduced upon temperature cycling allowing us to employ
different local imaging techniques to directly compare the magnetic and
transport state of a single EPS domain. Our results confirm the one-to-one
correspondence between ferromagnetic (AFM) to metallic (insulating) state in
manganite. It also represents a significant step in a paradigm shift from
passively characterizing EPS in strongly correlated systems to actively
engaging in its manipulation.

<h3>Materials Property Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification: A  Benchmark Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02235" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02235</a>

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has increasing importance in building robust
high-performance and generalizable materials property prediction models. It can
also be used in active learning to train better models by focusing on getting
new training data from uncertain regions. There are several categories of UQ
methods each considering different types of uncertainty sources. Here we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the UQ methods for graph neural network
based materials property prediction and evaluate how they truly reflect the
uncertainty that we want in error bound estimation or active learning. Our
experimental results over four crystal materials datasets (including formation
energy, adsorption energy, total energy, and band gap properties) show that the
popular ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation is NOT the best choice for
UQ in materials property prediction. For the convenience of the community, all
the source code and data sets can be accessed freely at

<h3>Microscopic picture of superfluid $^4$He</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02236</a>
<br>
<i>Yongle Yu, Hailin Luo</i>
<br>
<br>
We illustrate the microscopic quantum picture of superfluid helium-4 with the
help of
revealing a hidden property of its many-body levels. We show that, below the
transition point, the low-lying levels of the system form a grouping structure
with each level belonging to one specific group only. In a superflow state or a
static state, the system establishes a group-specific thermal equilibrium with
its environment and the levels of an initially-occupied group shall be
thermally distributed.
The other initially-unoccupied groups of levels remain unoccupied, due to the
fact that inter-group transitions are prohibited. The macroscopically
observable physical quantities of the system, such as superflow velocity and
thermal energy density, are
determined statistically by the thermal distribution of the occupied
group(s). We further show that thermal energy of a superflow has an unusual
flow velocity dependence: the larger the velocity is, the smaller the thermal
energy. This velocity dependence is responsible for several intriguing
phenomena of the system, such as the mechano-caloric effect and the fountain
effect, which demonstrate a fundamental coupling between the thermal motion of
the system and its hydrodynamic motion. We report an experimental observation
of a counter-intuitive self-heating effect of $^4$He superflows, which confirms
that a helium-4 superflow carries significant thermal energy depending on its
velocity.

<h3>Reaction-induced molecular dancing and boosted diffusion of enzymes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02374</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroyuki Kitahata, Alexander S. Mikhailov</i>
<br>
<br>
A novel mechanism of reaction-induced active molecular motion, not involving
any kind of self-propulsion, is proposed and analyzed. Because of the momentum
exchange with the surrounding solvent, conformational transitions in
mechano-chemical enzymes are accompanied by motions of their centers of mass.
As we show, in combination with rotational diffusion, such repeated reciprocal
motions generate an additional random walk - or molecular dancing - and hence
boost translational diffusion of an enzyme. A systematic theory of this
phenomenon is developed, using as an example a simple enzyme model of a rigid
two-state dumbbell. To support the analysis, numerical simulations are
performed. Our conclusion is that the phenomenon of molecular dancing could
underlie the observations of reaction-induced diffusion enhancement in enzymes.
Major experimental findings, such as the occurrence of leaps, the
anti-chemotaxis, the linear dependence on the reaction turnover rate and on the
rate of energy supply, become thus explained. Moreover, the dancing behavior is
possible in other systems, natural and synthetic, too. In the future,
interesting biotechnology applications may be developed using such effects.

<h3>Curiosity search for non-equilibrium behaviors in a dynamically learned  order parameter space</h3>

Exploring the spectrum of novel behaviors a physical system can produce can
be a labor-intensive task. Active learning is a collection of iterative
sampling techniques developed in response to this challenge. However, these
techniques often require a pre-defined metric, such as distance in a space of
known order parameters, in order to guide the search for new behaviors. Order
parameters are rarely known for non-equilibrium systems \textit{a priori},
especially when possible behaviors are also unknown, creating a chicken-and-egg
problem. Here, we combine active and unsupervised learning for automated
exploration of novel behaviors in non-equilibrium systems with unknown order
parameters. We iteratively use active learning based on current order
parameters to expand the library of known behaviors and then relearn order
parameters based on this expanded library. We demonstrate the utility of this
approach in Kuramoto models of coupled oscillators of increasing complexity. In
addition to reproducing known phases, we also reveal previously unknown
behavior and related order parameters.

<h3>Strong Casimir-like Forces in Flocking Active Matter</h3>

<br>
<br>
Confining in space the equilibrium fluctuations of statistical systems with
long-range correlations is known to result into effective forces on the
boundaries. Here we demonstrate the occurrence of these Casimir-like forces in
the non-equilibrium context provided by flocking active matter. In particular,
we consider a system of aligning self-propelled particles in two spatial
dimensions in the bulk flocking phase and transversally confined by reflecting
or partly repelling walls. We show that a finite-size contribution to the
pressure on the wall emerges, which decays slowly and algebraically upon
increasing the distance between the walls, with a certain degree of
universality. We rationalize our findings within a hydrodynamic approach for
the density and velocity field, formulating some conjectures based on our
numerical data which need to be confirmed beyond the linear approximation.

<h3>Magnetic quantum phase transition in a metallic Kondo heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02071" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02071</a>

We consider a two-dimensional quantum spin system described by a Heisenberg
model that is embedded in a three-dimensional metal. The two systems couple via
an antiferromagnetic Kondo interaction. In such a setup, the ground state
generically remains metallic down to the lowest temperatures and allows us to
study magnetic quantum phase transitions in metallic environments. From the
symmetry point of view, translation symmetry is present in two out of three
lattice directions such that crystal momentum is only partially conserved.
Importantly, the construction provides a route to study, with
negative-sign-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods, the physics of
local moments in metallic environments. Our large-scale numerical simulations
show that as a function of the Kondo coupling, the system has two metallic
phases. In the limit of strong Kondo coupling, a paramagnetic heavy-fermion
phase emerges. Here, the spin degree of freedom is screened by means of the
formation of a composite quasiparticle that participates in the Luttinger
count. At weak Kondo coupling, magnetic order is present. This phase is
characterized by Landau-damped Goldstone modes. Furthermore, the aforementioned
composite quasiparticle remains intact across the quantum phase transition.

<h3>Spin-orbit and exchange proximity couplings in graphene/1T-TaS$_2$  heterostructure triggered by a charge density wave</h3>

Proximity-induced fine features and spin-textures of the electronic bands in
graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures can be explored from the point of
tailoring a twist angle. Here we study spin-orbit coupling and exchange
coupling engineering of graphene states in the proximity of 1T-TaS$_2$ not
triggering the twist, but a charge density wave in 1T-TaS$_2$-a realistic
low-temperature phase. Using density functional theory and effective model we
found that the emergence of the charge density wave in 1T-TaS$_2$ significantly
enhances Rashba spin-orbit splitting in graphene and tilts the spin texture by
a significant Rashba angle-in a very similar way as in the conventional
twist-angle scenarios. Moreover, the partially filled Ta $d$-band in the charge
density wave phase leads to the spontaneous emergence of the in-plane magnetic
order that transgresses via proximity from 1T-TaS$_2$ to graphene, hence,
simultaneously superimposing along the spin-orbit also the exchange coupling
proximity effect. To describe this intricate proximity landscape we have
developed an effective model Hamiltonian and provided a minimal set of
parameters that excellently reproduces all the spectral features predicted by
the first-principles calculations. Conceptually, the charge density wave
provides a highly interesting knob to control the fine features of electronic
states and to tailor the superimposed proximity effects-a sort of twistronics
without twist.

<h3>3-Dimensional Tuning of an Atomically Defined Silicon Tunnel Junction</h3>

A requirement for quantum information processors is the in-situ tunability of
the tunnel rates and the exchange interaction energy within the device. The
large energy level separation for atom qubits in silicon is well suited for
qubit operation but limits device tunability using in-plane gate architectures,
requiring vertically separated top-gates to control tunnelling within the
device. In this paper we address control of the simplest tunnelling device in
Si:P, the tunnel junction. Here we demonstrate that we can tune its conductance
by using a vertically separated top-gate aligned with +-5nm precision to the
junction. We show that a monolithic 3D epitaxial top-gate increases the
capacitive coupling by a factor of 3 compared to in-plane gates, resulting in a
tunnel barrier height tunability of 0-186meV. By combining multiple gated
junctions in series we extend our monolithic 3D gating technology to implement
nanoscale logic circuits including AND and OR gates.

<h3>Dynamics of light-induced anomalous Hall effect in the three-dimensional  Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02229</a>

<br>
<br>
We experimentally study the dynamical behavior of the light-induced anomalous
Hall effect in a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal, Cd$_3$As$_2$. An
ultrashort, circularly polarized, multi-terahertz pump pulse breaks the
time-reversal symmetry of a thin film sample. The resulting anomalous Hall
effect is clearly observed through the polarization rotation of a single-cycle
terahertz probe pulse. Comparing the experimental result with theory, we find
that the field-induced injection current dominates the anomalous Hall effect
during pump irradiation, while the Berry curvature of the Floquet-Weyl
semimetal state does not appreciably contribute. Remarkably, even after pump
irradiation, we observe an anomalous Hall effect that lasts for more than 10
ps. A model fit to the Hall conductivity spectrum reveals a relatively long
scattering time over 400 fs. This result shows that circularly polarized light
creates a polarization of the isospin degree of freedom in the Dirac semimetal,
which labels the crystallographic point group representation of the overlapping
Weyl semimetal bands. Our observation paves the way for conversion of a robust
isospin flow into an electric current at room temperature, being a new analogue
of the inverse spin Hall effect.

<h3>Spin and Spin Current -- From Fundamentals to Recent Progresses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02241" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02241</a>

<br>
<br>
Along with the progress of the spin science and spintronics research, the
flow of electron spins, \emph{i.e.}, spin current, has come to attract
attention. New phenomena and electronic states were explained one after another
using the concept of spin current. Moreover, as many of the conventionally
known spintronics phenomena became well organized based on spin current it has
rapidly been recognized as an essential concept in a wide range of condensed
matter physics. In this article, we focus on recent developments in the physics
of spin, spin current, and their related phenomena, where the conversion
between spin angular momentum and different forms of angular momentum plays an
essential role. Starting with an introduction to spin current, we first discuss
the recent progress in the spintronic phenomena driven by spin-exchange
coupling: spin pumping, topological Hall torque, and emergent inductor. We then
extend our discussion to the interaction/interconversion of spins with heat,
lattice vibrations, and charge current and address recent progress and
perspectives on the spin Seebeck and Peltier effects. Next, we review the
interaction between mechanical motion and electron/nuclear spins and argue the
difference between the Barnett field and the rotational Doppler effect. We show
that the Barnett effect reveals the angular momentum compensation temperature,
at which the net angular momentum is quenched in ferrimagnets.

<h3>Divergent stiffness of one-dimensional growing interfaces</h3>

<br>
<br>
When a spatially localized stress is applied to a growing one-dimensional
interface, the interface deforms. This deformation is described by the
effective surface tension representing the stiffness of the interface. We
present that the stiffness exhibits divergent behavior in the large system size
limit for a growing interface with thermal noise, which has never been observed
for equilibrium interfaces. Furthermore, by connecting the effective surface
tension with a space-time correlation function, we elucidate the mechanism that
anomalous dynamical fluctuations lead to divergent stiffness.

<h3>Adhesion of fluid infused silicone elastomer to glass</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02264" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02264</a>

<br>
<br>
Elastomers swollen with non-polar fluids show potential as anti-adhesive
materials. We study the effect of oil fraction and contact time on the adhesion
between swollen spherical probes of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) and flat glass
surfaces. The PDMS probes are swollen with pre-determined amount of 10 cSt
silicone oil to span the range where the PDMS is fluid free (via solvent
extraction) up to the limit where it is oil saturated. Probe tack measurements
show that adhesion decreases rapidly with an increase in oil fraction. The
decrease in adhesion is attributed to excess oil present at the PDMS-air
interface. Contact angle measurements and optical microscopy images support
this observation. Adhesion also increases with contact time for a given oil
fraction. The increase in adhesion with contact time can be interpreted through
different competing mechanisms that depend on the oil fraction where the
dominant mechanism changes from extracted to fully swollen PDMS. For partially
swollen PDMS, we observe that adhesion initially increases because of
viscoelastic relaxation and at long times increases because of contact aging.
In contrast, adhesion between fully swollen PDMS and glass barely increases
over time and is mainly due to capillary forces. While the relaxation of PDMS
in contact is well-described by a visco-poroelastic model, we do not see
evidence that poroelastic relaxation of the PDMS contributes to an increase of
adhesion with glass whether it is partially or fully swollen.

<br>
<br>
Evolution in time-varying environments naturally leads to adaptable
biological systems that can easily switch functionalities. Advances in the
synthesis of environmentally-responsive materials therefore open up the
possibility of creating a wide range of synthetic materials which can also be
trained for adaptability. We consider high-dimensional inverse problems for
materials where any particular functionality can be realized by numerous
equivalent choices of design parameters. By periodically switching targets in a
given design algorithm, we can teach a material to perform incompatible
functionalities with minimal changes in design parameters. We exhibit this
learning strategy for adaptability in two simulated settings: elastic networks
that are designed to switch deformation modes with minimal bond changes; and
heteropolymers whose folding pathway selections are controlled by a minimal set
of monomer affinities. The resulting designs can reveal physical principles,
such as nucleation-controlled folding, that enable adaptability.

<br>
Systems of spins engineered with tunable density and reduced dimensionality
enable a number of advancements in quantum sensing and simulation. Defects in
diamond, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and substitutional nitrogen (P1
centers), are particularly promising solid-state platforms to explore. However,
the ability to controllably create coherent, two-dimensional spin systems and
characterize their properties, such as density, depth confinement, and
coherence is an outstanding materials challenge. We present a refined approach
to engineer dense ($\gtrsim$1 ppm$\cdot$nm), 2D nitrogen and NV layers in
diamond using delta-doping during plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD) epitaxial growth. We employ both traditional materials techniques, e.g.
secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), alongside NV spin decoherence-based
measurements to characterize the density and dimensionality of the P1 and NV
layers. We find P1 densities of 5-10 ppm$\cdot$nm, NV densities between 1 and
3.5 ppm$\cdot$nm tuned via electron irradiation dosage, and depth confinement
of the spin layer down to 1.6 nm. We also observe high (up to 42$\%$)
conversion of P1 to NV centers and reproducibly long NV coherence times,
dominated by dipolar interactions with the engineered P1 and NV spin baths.

<h3>Bias-Independent Subthreshold Swing in Nanoscale Cold-Source  Field-Effect Transistors by Drain Density-of-States Engineering</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report a strategy to design nanoscale cold-source field-effect transistors
(CS-FETs) with bias-independent sub-60 mV/dec subthreshold swing (SS). By
first-principles calculations and quantum-transport simulations, we reveal that
the energy alignment of density of states (DOS) between the drain and source
electrodes is critical to achieving bias-independent SS. By defining "gate
window", we propose a device model to demonstrate how similar slopes of the
drain DOS falling into the gate window can stabilize the SS under different
bias. This study underscores the significance of drain DOS engineering in the
design of CS-FETs with bias-independent SS for portable electronic
applications.

<h3>Quantized thermoelectric Hall plateau in the quantum limit of graphite  as a nodal line semimetal</h3>

We performed thermoelectric Hall conductivity $\alpha_{xy}$ measurements on
single crystal graphite in the quantum limit up to 13 T. Both electrical and
thermoelectric transport measurements were performed on the same crystal to
extract pure $\alpha_{xy}$ avoiding any sample quality dependence. The
$\alpha_{xy}$ converges to a plateau in the quantum limit with a linear
dependence on temperature. This behavior is analogous to the quantized
thermoelectric Hall effect (QTHE) observed in 3D Dirac/Weyl nodal point
semimetals, and experimentally confirms a theoretical proposal on the QTHE in
semimetals with nodal lines like graphite.

Magnons are elementary excitations in magnetic materials and undergo
nonlinear multimode scattering processes at large input powers. In experiments
and simulations, we show that the interaction between magnon modes of a
confined magnetic vortex can be harnessed for pattern recognition. We study the
magnetic response to signals comprising sine wave pulses with frequencies
corresponding to radial mode excitations. Three-magnon scattering results in
the excitation of different azimuthal modes, whose amplitudes depend strongly
on the input sequences. We show that recognition rates above 95\% can be
attained for four-symbol sequences using the scattered modes, with strong
performance maintained with the presence of amplitude noise in the inputs.

Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based on van der Waals (vdW) magnetic layers
has been found to present excellent tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) property,
which has great potential applications in field sensing, non-volatile magnetic
random access memories, and spin logics. Although MTJs composed of multilayer
vdW magnetic homojunctions have been extensively investigated, the ones
composed of vdW magnetic heterojunction is still to be explored. Here we use
first-principles approaches to reveal that the magnetic heterojunction MTJs
have much more distinguishable TMR values than the homojunction ones. In the
MTJ composed of bilayer CrI3/bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 heterojunction, we find there
are eight stable magnetic states, leading to seven distinguishable electronic
resistances. As a result, six sizable TMRs larger than 600% can be obtained
(the maximum TMR is up to 120,000%). The number of distinguishable memories is
more than two times larger than that of a four-layered homojunction MTJ. The
underlying relationships among magnetic state, spin-polarized band structures,
and transmission spectrums are further revealed to explain the multiple TMR
values. We also find that the magnetic states and thus TMRs can be efficiently
modulated by an external electric field. This study opens an avenue to the
design of high-performance MTJ devices based on vdW heterojunctions.

We report the crystal structure and electronic properties under high pressure
up to 10 GPa on a heavy fermion superconductor UTe2 by means of x-ray
diffraction and electrical resistivity experiments. The x-ray diffraction
measurements under high pressure using a synchrotron light source reveal
anisotropic linear compressibility of the unit cell up to 3.5 GPa, while a
pressure-induced structural phase transition is observed above 4 GPa at room
temperature, where the body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure with the
space group Immm changes into a body-centered tetragonal structure with the
space group I4/mmm. The molar volume drops abruptly at the critical pressure of
the structural transition, while the distance between the first-nearest
neighbor of U atoms abruptly increases, implying a switch from the heavy
electronic states to the weakly correlated electronic states. Surprisingly, a
new superconducting phase at high pressures above 7 GPa was detected at Tsc >
2K with a relatively low upper critical field, Hc2(0). The resistivity above
3.5 GPa, thus in the high-pressure tetragonal phase, shows a large drop below
230 K, revealing a drastic change from the heavy electronic states to the
weakly correlated state.

We develop a chiral anomalous fermion hamiltonian proposal to study the
higher order topological (HOT) phase with chiral symmetry $\mathcal{C}$
fractionalized like $\mathcal{C}_{x}\mathcal{C}_{y}\mathcal{C}_{z}$. First, we
solve the $\mathcal{C}$-chiral symmetry constraint for eight band models and
describe those induced by the partial $\mathcal{C}_{i}$'s. Then, we determine
the explicit expression of fractional states characterising HOT matter and
comment on the relationships amongst them and with the standard
Altland-Zirnbauer gapless modes. We also give characteristic properties of the
gapless fractional states and compute their contribution to the topological
index of the chiral model. The findings of this work are shown to be crucial
for investigating and handling high order topological phase.

<h3>Structure of ionic liquids and concentrated electrolytes from a  mesoscopic theory</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Ciach, O. Patsahan</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, underscreening in concentrated electrolytes was discovered in
experiments and confirmed in simulations and theory. It was found that the
correlation length of the charge-charge correlations, $\lambda_s$, satisfies
the scaling relation $\lambda_s/\lambda_D\sim (a/\lambda_D)^n$, where
$\lambda_D$ is the Debye screening length and $a$ is the ionic diameter.
However, different values of n were found in different studies. In this work we
solve this puzzle within the mesocopic theory that yielded n=3 in agreement
with experiments, but only very high densities of ions were considered [A.
Ciach A. and O. Patsahan, {\it J.Phys.: Condens. Matter} {\textbf 33}, 37LT01
(2021)]. Here we apply the theory to a broader range of density of ions and
find that different values of n in the above scaling can yield a fair
approximation for $\lambda_s/\lambda_D$ for different ranges of $a/\lambda_D$.
The experimentally found scaling holds for $2 <a/\lambda_D<4$, and we find n=3
for the same range of the reduced Debye length. For smaller $a/\lambda_D$, we
find n=2 obtained earlier in several simulation and theoretical studies, and
still closer to the Kirkwood line we obtain n=1.5 that was also predicted in
different works. It follows from our theory that n=3 (i.e. $\lambda_s$ is
proportional to the density of ions) when the variance of the local charge
density is large, and $\lambda_s$ is proportional to this variance times the
Bjerrum length. Detailed derivation of the theory is presented.

<br>
<br>
In the spirit of multi-scale modeling, we develop a theoretical framework for
spin-lattice coupling that connects, on the one hand, to ab initio calculations
of spin-lattice coupling parameters and, on the other hand, to the
magneto-elastic continuum theory. The derived Hamiltonian describes a closed
system of spin and lattice degrees of freedom and explicitly conserves the
total momentum, angular momentum and energy. Using a new numerical
implementation that corrects earlier Suzuki-Trotter decompositions we perform
simulations on the basis of the resulting equations of motion to investigate
the combined magnetic and mechanical motion of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle,
thereby validating our developed method. In addition to the ferromagnetic
resonance mode of the spin system we find another low-frequency mechanical
response and a rotation of the particle according to the Einstein-de-Haas
effect. The framework developed herein will enable the use of multi-scale
modeling for investigating and understanding a broad range of
magneto-mechanical phenomena from slow to ultrafast time scales.

<h3>Two-dimensional Rare-earth Halide Based Single Phase Triferroic</h3>

<br>
<i>Srishti Bhardwaj, T. Maitra</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional multiferroic materials are highly sought after due to their
huge potential for applications in nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. Here,
we predict, based on first-principle calculations, a single phase {\it
triferroic} where three ferroic orders; ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity and
ferroelasticity, coexist simultaneously in hole doped GdCl$_2$ monolayer (a
ferromagnetic semiconductor). This is achieved by substituting 1/3rd of the
Gd$^{2+}$ ions with Eu$^{2+}$ in the hexagonal structure of GdCl$_2$ monolayer.
The resulting metallic state undergoes a bond-centered charge ordering driving
a distortion in the hexagonal structure making it semiconducting again and {\it
ferroelastic}. Further, the lattice distortion accompanied by a breaking of the
lattice centrosymmetry renders a non-centrosymmetric charge distribution which
makes the monolayer {\it ferroelectric}, at the same time. The two ferroic
orders, ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity, present in Eu doped GdCl$_2$
monolayer are found to be strongly coupled making it a promising candidate for
device applications. The doped monolayer remains a ferromagnetic semiconductor
with large 4f magnetic moment just like the parent monolayer and possesses an
even higher (out-of-plane) magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) than its pristine
counterpart as desired for two dimensional magnets to have high transition
temperature.

We have analyzed a limited sample set of 120 GHz, and 150 GHz time-resolved
millimeter wave (mmW) photoconductive decay (mmPCD) signals of 300 nm thick
air-stable encapsulated perovskite film (methyl-ammonium lead halide) excited
using a pulsed 532-nm laser with fluence 10.6 micro-Joules per cm-2. We
correlated 12 parameters derived directly from acquired mmPCD kinetic-trace
data and its step-response, each with the sample-age based on the date of the
experiment. Five parameters with a high negative correlation with sample age
were finally selected as predictors in the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
machine learning model for prediction of the age of the sample. The effects of
aging (between 0 and 40,000 hours after film production) are quantified mainly
in terms of a shift in peak voltage, the response ratio (conductance
parameter), loss-compensated transmission coefficient, and the radiofrequency
(RF) area of the transient itself (flux). Changes in the other step-response
parameters and the decay length of the aging transients are also shown. The GPR
model is found to work well for a forward prediction of the age of the sample
using this method. It is noted that the Matern-5 over 2 GPR kernel for
supervised learning provides the best realistic solution for age prediction
with R squared around 0.97.

<br>
<i>Moallison F. Cavalcante, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Maria C. O. Aguiar</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the real-time dynamics of the Kondo effect after a quantum quench in
which a magnetic impurity is coupled to two metallic Hubbard chains. Using an
effective field theory approach, we find that for noninteracting electrons the
charge current across the impurity is given by a scaling function that involves
the Kondo time. In the interacting case, we show that the Kondo time decreases
with the strength of the repulsive interaction and the time dependence of the
current reveals signatures of the Kondo effect in a Luttinger liquid. In
addition, we verify that the relaxation of the impurity magnetization does not
exhibit universal scaling behavior in the perturbative regime below the Kondo
time. Our results highlight the role of nonequilibrium dynamics as a valuable
tool in the study of quantum impurities in interacting systems.

<i>M. D. Burke, Maxence Grandadam, J. P. F. LeBlanc</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a method to accelerate the numerical evaluation of spatial
integrals of Feynman diagrams when expressed on the real frequency axis. This
can be realized through use of a renormalized perturbation expansion with a
constant but complex renormalization shift. The complex shift acts as a
regularization parameter for the numerical integration of otherwise sharp
functions. This results in an exponential speed up of stochastic numerical
integration at the expense of evaluating additional counter-term diagrams. We
provide proof of concept calculations within a difficult limit of the
half-filled 2D Hubbard model on a square lattice.

<br>
Implementing superconductors capable of proximity-inducing a large energy-gap
in semiconductors in the presence of strong magnetic fields is a major goal
towards applications of semiconductor/superconductor hybrid materials in future
quantum information technologies. Here, we study the performance of devices
consisting of InAs nanowires in electrical contact to molybdenum-rhenium (MoRe)
superconducting alloys. The MoRe thin films exhibit transition temperatures ~10
K and critical fields exceeding 6 T. Normal/superconductor devices enabled
tunnel spectroscopy of the corresponding induced superconductivity, which was
maintained up to ~10 K, and MoRe based Josephson devices exhibit supercurrents
and multiple Andreev reflections. We determine an induced superconducting gap
lower than expected from the transition temperature, and observe gap softening
at finite magnetic field. These may be common features for hybrids based on
large gap, type-II superconductors. The results encourage further development
of MoRe-based hybrids.

Using density functional theory based methods we report the structural,
electronic and topological properties of the FCC crystal compound TmBi. This
material is found to be dynamically stable and shows a non magnetic semimetalic
character. By tuning the spin-orbit coupling, we observe a significant change
in the band structure, and the occurrence of band inversion along $\Gamma -X$
direction. The parity product at time-reversal invariant momentum points and
the Wannier charge center calculations provide a topological index $Z_{2}=1$ on
the $k_{j}=0$ plane (with $j=1,2$ and $3$) revealing the non trivial
topological character of TmBi. The existence of topologically protected surface
states of TmBi through the observation of a Dirac cones at $\bar{X}$ point
confirm our finding. The present work could inspire platforms for exploring
novel topological states within the family of rare-earth monobismuthides.

Unlike conventional two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor superlattices,
moir\'{e} patterns in 2D materials are flexible and their electronic, magnetic,
optical, and mechanical properties depend on their topography. Within a
continuous+atomistic theory treating 2D materials as crystalline elastic
membranes, we abandon the flat-membrane scenario usually assumed for these
materials and address out-of-plane deformations. We confront our predictions to
experimental analyses on model systems, epitaxial graphene, and MoS$_2$ on
metals and reveal that compression/expansion and bending energies stored in the
membrane can compete with adhesion energy, leading to a subtle moir\'{e}
wavelength selection and the formation of wrinkles.

<br>
<i>Galien Grosjean, Scott Waitukaitis</i>
<br>
<br>
Models for same-material contact electrification in granular media often rely
on a local charge-driving parameter whose spatial variations lead to a
stochastic origin for charge exchange. Measuring the charge transfer from
individual granular spheres after contacts with substrates of the same
material, we find that the charge-driving parameter is global, not local.
Cleaning and baking samples fully resets their charging behavior, which
indicates the underlying global parameter is not intrinsic to the material, but
acquired from its history. Charging behavior is randomly and irreversibly
affected by changes in relative humidity, pointing to a mechanism where
adsorbates, in particular water, are fundamental to the charge-transfer
process.

<br>
Motivated by the recent discoveries of superconductivity in bilayer and
trilayer graphene, we theoretically investigate superconductivity and other
interaction-driven phases in multilayer graphene stacks. To this end, we study
the density of states of multilayer graphene with up to four layers at the
single-particle band structure level in the presence of a transverse electric
field. Among the considered structures, tetralayer graphene with rhombohedral
(ABCA) stacking reaches the highest density of states. We study the phases that
can arise in ABCA graphene by tuning the carrier density and transverse
electric field. For a broad region of the tuning parameters, the presence of
strong Coulomb repulsion leads to a spontaneous spin and valley symmetry
breaking via Stoner transitions. Using a model that incorporates the
spontaneous spin and valley polarization, we explore the Kohn-Luttinger
mechanism for superconductivity driven by repulsive Coulomb interactions. We
find that the strongest superconducting instability is in the $p-$wave channel,
and occurs in proximity to the onset of Stoner transitions. Interestingly, we
find a range of densities and transverse electric fields where
superconductivity develops out of a strongly corrugated, singly-connected Fermi
surface in each valley, leading to a topologically non-trivial chiral $p+ip$
superconducting state with an even number of co-propagating chiral Majorana
edge modes. Our work establishes ABCA stacked tetralayer graphene as a
promising platform for observing strongly correlated physics and topological
superconductivity.

<br>
The interlayer exchange coupling confers specific properties to Synthetic
Antiferromagnets that make them suitable for several applications of
spintronics. The efficient use of this magnetic configuration requires an
in-depth understanding of the magnetic properties and their correlation with
the material structure. Here we establish a reliable procedure to quantify the
interlayer exchange coupling and the intralayer exchange stiffness in synthetic
antiferromagnets; we apply it to the ultrasmooth and amorphous
Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ (5-40 nm)/Ru/ Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ material
platform. The complex interplay between the two exchange interactions results
in a gradient of the magnetization orientation across the thickness of the
stack which alters the hysteresis and the spin wave eigenmodes of the stack in
a non trivial way. We measured the field-dependence of the frequencies of the
first four spin waves confined within the thickness of the stack. We modeled
these frequencies and the corresponding thickness profiles of these spin waves
using micromagnetic simulations. The comparison with the experimental results
allows to deduce the magnetic parameters that best account for the sample
behavior. The exchange stiffness is established to be 16 $\pm$ 2 pJ/m,
independently of the Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ thickness. The interlayer
exchange coupling starts from -1.7 mJ/m$^2$ for the thinnest layers and it can
be maintained above -1.3 mJ/m$^2$ for CoFeB layers as thick as 40 nm. The
comparison of our method with earlier characterizations using the sole
saturation fields argues for a need to revisit the tabulated values of
interlayer exchange coupling in thick synthetic antiferromagnets.

Locally (re)structuring colloidal gels $\unicode{x2013}$ micron-sized
particles forming a connected network with arrested dynamics $\unicode{x2013}$
enables precise tuning of the micromechanical and -rheological properties of
the system. A recent experimental study [B. Saint-Michel, G. Petekidis, and V.
Garbin, Soft Matter $\boldsymbol{18}$, 2092 (2022)] showed that rapid
restructuring can occur by acoustically modulating an embedded microbubble.
Here, we perform Brownian dynamics simulations to understand the mechanical
effect of an oscillating microbubble on the structure of the embedding
colloidal gel. Our simulations reveal a hexagonal-close-packed restructuring in
a range that is comparable to the amplitude of the oscillations. However, we
were unable to reproduce the unexpectedly long-ranged modification of the gel
structure $\unicode{x2013}$ dozens of amplitudes $\unicode{x2013}$ observed in
experiment. This suggests including long-ranged effects, such as fluid flow,
should be considered in future work.

Ab initio calculations are performed to study consecutive reconstruction of a
zigzag graphene edge. According to the obtained energy profile along the
reaction pathway, the first reconstruction step, formation of the first
pentagon-heptagon pair, is the slowest one, while the growth of an already
nucleated reconstructed edge domain should occur steadily at a much higher
rate. Domains merge into one only in 1/4 of cases when they get in contact,
while in the rest of the cases, residual defects are left. Structure, energy
and magnetic properties of these defects are studied. It is found that
spontaneous formation of pairs of residual defects (i.e. spontaneous domain
nucleation) in the fully reconstructed edge is unlikely at temperatures below
1000 K. Using a kinetic model, we show that the average domain length is of
several $\mathrm{\mu}$m at room temperature and it decreases exponentially upon
increasing the temperature at which the reconstruction takes place.

Monolayer graphene at charge neutrality in a quantizing magnetic field is a
quantum Hall ferromagnet. Due to the spin and valley (near) degeneracies, there
is a plethora of possible ground states. Previous theoretical work, based on a
stringent ultra short-range assumption on the symmetry-allowed interactions,
predicts a phase diagram with distinct regions of spin-polarized, canted
antiferromagnetic, inter-valley coherent, and charge density wave order. While
early experiments suggested that the system was in the canted antiferromagnetic
phase at a perpendicular field, recent scanning tunneling studies universally
find Kekul\'e bond order, and sometimes also charge density wave order.
Recently, it was found that if one relaxes the stringent assumption mentioned
above, a phase with coexisting canted antiferromagnetic and Kekul\'e order
exists in the region of the phase diagram believed to correspond to real
samples. In this work, starting from the continuum limit appropriate for
experiments, we present the complete phase diagram of $\nu=0$ graphene in the
Hartree-Fock approximation, using generic symmetry-allowed interactions,
assuming translation invariant ground states up to an intervalley coherence.
Allowing for a sublattice potential (valley Zeeman coupling), we find numerous
phases with different types of coexisting order. We conclude with a discussion
of the physical signatures of the various states.

<h3>Universal and nonuniversal scaling of transmission in thin random  layered media</h3>

The statistics of transmission through random 1D media are generally presumed
to be universal and to depend only upon a single dimensionless parameter, the
ratio of the sample length and the mean free path, s=L/l. For s much larger
than unity, the probability distribution function of the logarithm of
transmission, P(ln T) is Gaussian with average value -s and variance 2s. Here
we show in numerical simulations and optical measurements that in random binary
systems, and most prominently in systems for which s less than unity, the
statistics of transmission are universal for transmission near an upper cutoff
of unity and depend upon the character of the discrete disorder near a lower
cutoff. The universal behavior of P(ln T) closely resembles a segment of a
Gaussian and arises in random binary media with as few as three binary layers.
Above the lower cutoff, but below the crossover to a universal expression, the
shape of P(ln T) also depends upon the reflectivity of the interface between
the layers. For a given value of s, P(ln T) evolves towards a universal
distribution given by random matrix theory in the dense weak scattering limit
as the numbers of layers increases. P(ln T) found in simulations is compared to
results of random matrix calculations in the dense weak scattering limit but
with an imposed minimum in transmission. Optical measurements in stacks of
glass coverslips are compared to random matrix theory, and differences are
ascribed to transverse disorder in the layers.

We fabricate high-quality c-axis oriented epitaxial YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$
films with 15% of yttrium atoms replaced by terbium (YTBCO) and study their
electrical properties. The Tb substitution reduces the charge carrier density
resulting in increased resistivity and decreased critical current density
compared to the pure YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ films. The electrical properties of
the YTBCO films show an in-plane anisotropy in both the superconducting and
normal state providing evidence for the twin-free film. Unexpectedly, the
resistive transition of the bridges also demonstrates the in-plane anisotropy
that can be explained within the framework of Tinkham's model of the resistive
transition and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) model depending on the
sample parameters. We consider YTBCO films to be a promising platform for both
the fundamental research on the BKT transition in the cuprate superconductors
and for the fabrication of devices with high kinetic inductance.

In model Hamiltonians, like Fr\"ohlich's, the electron-phonon interaction is
assumed to be screened from the beginning. The same occurs when this
interaction is obtained by using the state-of-the-art density functional
perturbation theory as starting point. In this work I formally demonstrate that
these approaches are affected by a severe over-screening error. By using an
out-of-equilibrium Many-Body technique I discuss how to merge the many-body
approach with density-functional perturbation theory in order to correct the
over-screening error. A symmetric statically screened phonon self-energy is
obtained by down-folding the exact Baym-Kadanoff equations. The statically
screened approximation proposed here is shown to have the same long-range
spatial limit of the exact self-energy and to respect the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The doubly screened approximation, commonly
used in the literature, is shown, instead, to be over-screened, to violate
several Many-Body properties and to have a wrong spatial long-range decay. The
accuracy of the proposed approximation is tested against the exact solution of
an extended model Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian and it is applied to a paradigmatic
material: MgB$_2$. I find that the present treatment enhances the linewidths by
$57 \%$ with respect to what has been previously reported for the anomalous
$E_{2g}$ mode. I further discover that the $A_{2u}$ mode is also anomalous (its
strong coupling being completely quenched by the over-screened expression). The
present results deeply question methods based on state-of-the-art approaches
and impact a wide range of fields such as thermal conductivity, phononic
instabilities and non-equilibrium lattice dynamics.

Robust and tunable topological Josephson junctions (TJJs) are highly
desirable platforms for investigating the anomalous Josephson effect and
topological quantum computation applications. Experimental demonstrations have
been done in hybrid superconducting-two dimensional topological insulator
(2DTI) platforms, sensitive to magnetic disorder and interactions with phonons
and other electrons. In this work, we propose a robust and electrostatically
tunable TJJ by combining the physics of the integer quantum Hall (IQH) regime
and of superconductors. We provide analytical insights about the corresponding
Andreev bound state spectrum, the Josephson current and the anomalous current.
We demonstrate the existence of protected zero-energy crossings, that can be
controlled through electrostatic external gates. This electrostatic tunability
has a direct advantage to compensate for non-ideal interfaces and undesirable
reflections that may occur in any realistic samples. TJJs in the IQH regime
could be realized in graphene and other 2D materials. They are of particular
relevance towards scalable and robust Andreev-qubit platforms, and also for
efficient phase batteries.

We report the existence of moir\'e patterns and magic angle physics in all
families of chiral collapsed carbon nanotubes. A detailed study of the
electronic structure of all types of chiral nanotubes, previously collapsed via
molecular dynamics, has been performed. We find that each family possesses a
unique geometry and moir\'e disposition, as well as a characteristic number of
flat bands. Remarkably, all kinds of nanotubes behave the same with respect to
magic angle tuning, showing a monotonic behavior that gives rise to magic
angles in full agreement with those of twisted bilayer graphene. Therefore,
magic angle behavior is universally found in chiral collapsed nanotubes with a
small chiral angle, giving rise to moir\'e patterns. Our approach comprises
first-principles and semi-empirical calculations of the band structure, density
of states and spatial distribution of the localized states signaled by flat
bands.

Linearly dispersing Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) fermions featuring two Fermi
velocities are the key constituents of itinerant spin-3/2 quantum materials.
When doped, RSW metals sustain two Fermi surfaces (FSs), around which one fully
gapped $s$-wave and five \emph{mixed-parity} local pairings can take place.
Four of them support point nodes at the poles of two FSs. For weak (strong)
pairing amplitudes ($\Delta$), gapless north and south poles belonging to the
same (different) FS(s) get connected by \emph{polar hairs}, one-dimensional
line nodes occupying the region between two FSs. The remaining one, by
contrast, supports four nodal rings in between two FSs, symmetrically placed
about their equators, but only when $\Delta$ is small. For large $\Delta$, this
paired state becomes fully gapped. The transition temperature and pairing
amplitudes follow the BCS scaling. We explicitly showcase these outcomes for a
rotationally symmetric RSW metal, and contrast our findings when the system
possesses an enlarged Lorentz symmetry and with the ones in spin-3/2 Luttinger
materials.

Recently, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) has shown the
emergence of various interaction-driven novel quantum phases at the
commensurate fillings of the moir'e superlattice, while the charge neutrality
point (CNP) remains mostly a vanilla insulator. Here, we show an emerging phase
of nearly compensated semimetallicity at the CNP of twisted double bilayer
graphene (TDBLG), a close cousin of MATBLG, with signatures of electronic
correlation. Using electrical and thermal transport, we find almost two orders
of magnitude enhancement of the thermopower in magnetic fields much smaller
than the extreme quantum limit, accompanied by a large magnetoresistance($\sim
2500\%$) at CNP. This provides indisputable experimental evidence that TDBLG
near CNP is a compensated semimetal. Moreover, at low temperatures, we observe
an unusual sublinear temperature dependence of resistance. A recent theory
predicts the formation of an excitonic metal near CNP, where small electron and
hole pockets coexist. We understand the sublinear temperature dependence in
terms of critical fluctuations in this theory.
