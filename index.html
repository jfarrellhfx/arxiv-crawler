<h3>Constrained motions and slow dynamics in one-dimensional bosons with  double-well dispersion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04158</a>

<i>Yang-Zhi Chou, Jay D. Sau</i>

We investigate the dynamical properties of one-dimensional interacting bosons
with double-well dispersion, which can be realized in the ultracold atom
experiments. We demonstrate slow dynamics and constrained motion of domain
walls in the low-temperature symmetry-broken regime. The constrained
domain-wall motion is ``fracton-like'' -- a single domain wall cannot move
freely, while two nearby domain walls can move collectively. Consequently, we
find an Ohmic-like linear response and a vanishing superfluid stiffness, which
are atypical for gases in a disorder-free background. In addition, we develop a
hydrodynamic description for the dynamics controlled by the interacting quantum
Lifshitz critical point and obtain superfluid stiffness $\rho_s\sim T$ and
sound velocity ($v_s\sim T^{1/2}$), showing qualitatively similar
low-temperature dynamics to the symmetry-broken regime. Our results reveal
several unprecedented dynamical properties potentially relevant to fracton
phenomenology and explain the stable domain walls in the existing experiments.

Dynamics of optically-excited plasmonic nanoparticles are presently
understood as a series of sequential scattering events, involving
thermalization processes after pulsed optical excitation. One important step is
the initiation of nanoparticle breathing oscillations. According to established
experiments and models, these are caused by the statistical heat transfer from
thermalized electrons to the lattice. An additional contribution by hot
electron pressure has to be included to account for phase mismatches that arise
from the lack of experimental data on the breathing onset. We used optical
transient-absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved single-particle
x-ray-diffractive imaging to access the excited electron system and lattice.
The time-resolved single-particle imaging data provided structural information
directly on the onset of the breathing oscillation and confirmed the need for
an additional excitation mechanism to thermal expansion, while the observed
phase-dependence of the combined structural and optical data contrasted
previous studies. Therefore, we developed a new model that reproduces all our
experimental observations without using fit parameters. We identified
optically-induced electron density gradients as the main driving source.

Magnesium aluminate scandium oxide (ScAlMgO4) is a promising lattice-matched
substrate material for GaN- and ZnO-based optoelectronic devices. Yet, despite
its clear advantages over substrates commonly used in heteroepitaxial growth,
several fundamental properties of ScAlMgO4 remain unsettled. Here, we provide a
comprehensive picture of its optical, electronic and structural properties by
studying ScAlMgO4 single crystals grown by the Czochralski method. We use
variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to determine complex in-plane and
out-of-plane refractive indices in the range from 193 to 1690 nm. An
oscillator-based model provides a phenomenological description of the
ellipsometric spectra with excellent agreement over the entire range of
wavelengths. For convenience, we supply the reader also with Cauchy formulas
describing the real part of the anisotropic refractive index for wavelengths
above 400 nm. Ab initio many-body perturbation theory modeling provides
information about the electronic structure of ScAlMgO4, and successfully
validated experimentally obtained refractive index values. Simulations also
show exciton binding energy as large as a few hundred of meV, indicating
ScAlMgO4 as a promising material for implementation in low-threshold, deep-UV
lasing devices operating at room temperature. X-ray diffraction measurements
confirm lattice constants of ScAlMgO4 previously reported, but in addition,
reveal that dominant crystallographic planes (001) are mutually inclined by
about 0.009{\deg}. In view of our work, ScAlMgO4 is a highly transparent, low
refractive index, birefringent material similar to a sapphire, but with a much
more favorable lattice constant and simpler processing.

<h3>Crossover from attractive to repulsive induced interactions and bound  states of two distinguishable Bose polarons</h3>

We study the impact of induced correlations and quasiparticle properties by
immersing two distinguishable impurities in a harmonically trapped bosonic
medium. It is found that when the impurities couple both either repulsively or
attractively to their host, the latter mediates a two-body correlated behavior
between them. In the reverse case, namely the impurities interact oppositely
with the host, they feature anti-bunching. Monitoring the impurities relative
distance and constructing an effective two-body model to be compared with the
full many-body calculations, we are able to associate the induced (anti-)
correlated behavior of the impurities with the presence of attractive
(repulsive) induced interactions. Furthermore, we capture the formation of a
bipolaron and trimer state in the strongly attractive regime, where the latter
consists of two impurities and a medium atom. Our results open the way for
controlling polaron induced correlations and creating relevant bound states.

<h3>Transport in a periodically--driven tilted lattice via the extended  reservoir approach: Stability criterion for recovering the continuum limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04160" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04160</a>

Extended reservoirs provide a framework for capturing macroscopic, continuum
environments, such as metallic electrodes driving a current through a nanoscale
contact, impurity, or material. We examine the application of this approach to
periodically--driven systems, specifically in the context of quantum transport.
As with non--equilibrium steady states in time--independent scenarios, the
current displays a Kramers' turnover including the formation of a plateau
region that captures the physical, continuum limit response. We demonstrate
that a simple stability criteria identifies an appropriate relaxation rate to
target this physical plateau. Using this approach, we study quantum transport
through a periodically--driven tilted lattice coupled to two metallic
reservoirs held at a finite bias and temperature. We use this model to
benchmark the extended reservoir approach and assess the stability criteria.
When the system and reservoir are weakly coupled, the approach recovers
well--understood physical behavior in this limit. Extended reservoirs enable
addressing strong coupling and non--linear response as well, where we analyze
how transport responds to the dynamics inside the driven lattice. These results
set the foundations for the use of extended reservoir approach for
periodically-driven, quantum systems, such as many--body Floquet states.

<h3>Impact of gapped spin-orbit excitons on low energy pseudospin exchange  interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04169" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04169</a>
<br>
<i>Sreekar Voleti, F David Wandler, Arun Paramekanti</i>
<br>
<br>
The quest for exotic quantum magnetic ground states, including the Kitaev
spin liquid and quantum spin-ices, has led to the discovery of several quantum
materials where low energy pseudospin-$1/2$ doublets arise from the splitting
of spin-orbit entangled multiplets with higher degeneracy. Such systems include
$d$-orbital and $f$-orbital Mott insulators. When the gap between the low
energy pseudospin-$1/2$ levels and the excited levels of the multiplet or
`excitons' is not large, the effective low-energy exchange interactions between
the low energy pseudospin-$1/2$ moments can acquire significant corrections
from coupling to the excitons. We extract these corrections using higher order
perturbation theory as well as an exact Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. Such
corrections can impact the exchange matrix for the low energy pseudospin-$1/2$
levels by renormalizing the strength and the sign of Heisenberg exchange or
Ising anisotropies, and potentially even inducing bond-anisotropic couplings
such as Kitaev-$\Gamma$ exchange interactions. We discuss recent experiments on
various cobaltate and osmate materials which hint at the ubiquity and
importance of this physics.

<h3>Inducing Superconductivity in Bilayer Graphene by Alleviation of the  Stoner Blockade</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04176" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04176</a>

External magnetic fields conventionally suppress superconductivity, both by
orbital and paramagnetic effects. A recent experiment has shown that in a
Bernal stacked bilayer graphene system, the opposite occurs -- a finite
critical magnetic field is necessary to observe superconducting features
occurring in the vicinity of a magnetic phase transition. We propose an
extraordinary electronic-correlation-driven mechanism by which this anomalous
superconductivity manifests. Specifically, the electrons tend to avoid band
occupations near high density of states regions due to their mutual repulsion.
Considering the nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking involved, we dub this
avoidance Stoner blockade. We show how a magnetic field softens this blockade,
allowing weak superconductivity to take place, consistent with experimental
findings. Our principle prediction is that a small reduction of the Coulomb
repulsion would result in sizable superconductivity gains, both in achieving
higher critical temperatures and expanding the superconducting regime. Within
the theory we present, magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling of the Ising type
have a similar effect on the Bernal stacked bilayer graphene system,
elucidating the emergence of superconductivity when the system is proximitized
to a $\rm WSe_2$ substrate. We further demonstrate in this paper the
sensitivity of superconductivity to disorder in the proposed scenario. We find
that a disorder that does not violate Anderson's theorem may still induce a
reduction of $T_c$ through its effect on the density of states, establishing
the delicate nature of the Bernal bilayer graphene superconductor.

<h3>Liovillian gap and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a sunburst Kitaev  ring: from local to uniform dissipation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04207" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04207</a>

<i>Alessio Franchi, Francesco Tarantelli</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider an open quantum system composed of a $(1+1)$-dimensional Kitaev
ring coupled with the environment via $n$ particle-loss dissipators in a
\textit{sunburst} geometry. We describe the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the
whole apparatus in terms of Lindblad master equations and focus on the scaling
behavior of the Liovillian gap $\Delta_\lambda$ with the system size $L$. We
unveil different regimes, which depend primarily on the number of dissipation
sources considered in the large-size limit and the dissipation strength $w$,
which may be either fixed or attenuated to zero as $w\sim1/L$. In the second
part, we develop a dynamic Finite-Size Scaling framework close to Continuous
Quantum Transitions to monitor the time evolution of the critical correlations
and the entanglement entropy, emphasizing the role of $\Delta_\lambda$ in this
regime.

<h3>The Reverse Quantum Limit: Implications for Unconventional Quantum  Oscillations in YbB$_{12}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Beyond the quantum limit, many-body effects are expected to induce unusual
electronic phase transitions. Materials possessing metallic ground states with
strong interactions between localized and itinerant electronic states are
natural candidates for the realization of such quantum phases. However, the
electronic correlations responsible for increasing the likelihood of novel
phases simultaneously place the quantum limit beyond the reach of laboratory
magnets. Here we propose these difficulties can be surmounted in materials with
strong correlations and insulating ground states. Strong correlations in
insulators and high magnetic fields conspire to fill Landau levels in the
reverse order compared to conventional metals, such that the lowest Landau
level is the first observed. Consequently, the quantum limit in strongly
correlated insulators is reached in reverse and at fields accessible in
laboratories. Quantum oscillations measured at high fields in YbB12 are shown
to have features consistent with the reverse quantum limit. These include how
quantum oscillations move in lock step with the angular evolution of the
insulator-metal transition and the field dependence of the quantum oscillation
frequency. We argue that close to the insulator-metal transition, the
insulating state should be viewed through the lens of a magnetic field-induced
electronic instability affecting the lowest Landau level states in the quantum
limit.

A $1$-parameter family of invertible states gives a topological transport
phenomenon, similar to the Thouless pumping. As a natural generalization of
this, we can consider a family of invertible states parametrized by some
topological space $X$. This is called a higher pump. It is conjectured that
$(1+1)$-dimensional bosonic invertible state parametrized by $X$ is classified
by $\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. In this paper, we construct two higher
pumping models parametrized by $X=\mathbb{R}P^{2}\times S^1$ and
$X=\mathrm{L}(3,1)\times S^1$ that corresponds to the torsion part of
$\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. As a consequence of the nontriviality as a
family, we find that a quantum mechanical system with a nontrivial discrete
Berry phase is pumped to the boundary of the $(1+1)$-dimensional system. We
also study higher pump phenomena by using matrix product states (MPS), and
construct a higher pump invariant which takes value in a torsion part of
$\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. This is a higher analog of the ordinary
discrete Berry phase that takes value in the torsion part of
$\mathrm{H}^{2}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. In order to define the higher pump invariant,
we utilize the smooth Deligne cohomology and its integration theory. We confirm
that the higher pump invariant of the model has a nontrivial value.

<h3>Topological origin of flat-bands as pseudo-Landau levels in uniaxial  strained graphene nanoribbons and induced magnetic ordering due to  electron-electron interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04262</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Flat-bands play a central role in the presence of correlated phases in
Moir\'e and other modulated two dimensional systems. In this work, flat-bands
are shown to exist in uniaxially periodic strained graphene. Such strain should
be produced for example by a substrate. The model is thus mapped into a
one-dimensional effective Hamiltonian and this allows to find the conditions
for having flat-bands, i.e., a long-wavelength modulation only on each one of
the bipartite graphene sublattices, while having a tagged strain field between
neighboring carbon atoms. The origin of such flat-bands is thus tracked down to
the existence of topological localized wavefunctions at domain walls separating
different regions, each with a non-uniform Su-Schriffer-Hegger model (SSH) type
of coupling. Thereafter, the system is mapped into a continuum model allowing
to explain the numerical results in terms of the Jackiw-Rebbi model and of
pseudo-Landau levels. Finally, the interplay between the obtained flat-bands
and electron-electron interaction is explored through the Hubbard model. The
numerical results within the mean-field approximation indicate that the
flat-bands induce N\'eel antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic domains even for a
very weak Hubbard interaction. The present model thus provides a simple
platform to understand the physical origin of flat-bands, pseudo-Landau levels
and the effects of the electron-electron interaction.

<h3>Majorana Gap Formation in the Anisotropic Kitaev Model with Ordered Flux  Configuration</h3>

<br>

We study the Kitaev model with direction dependent interactions to
investigate how the flux configuration and/or the anisotropy in the exchanges
affect the Majorana excitations. Systematic numerical calculations demonstrate
how the anisotropy of the exchange couplings and flux configuration make the
Majorana excitation gapped. The induced gapped quantum spin liquid states are
distinct from the gapped one realized in the large anisotropic limit. The
nature of gapped states can be explained by the superlattice potential due to
flux configuration.

<h3>Sn/InAs Josephson junctions on selective area grown nanowires with  in-situ shadowed superconductor evaporation</h3>

Superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrid structures are useful in
fabricating devices for quantum information processing. While selective area
growth (SAG) offers the flexibility to grow semiconductor nanowires in
arbitrary geometries, in-situ evaporation of superconductors ensures pristine
superconductor-semiconductor interfaces, resulting in strong induced
superconductivity in the semiconducting nanowire. In this work, we evaporated
islands of superconductor tin on InAs SAG nanowires, by using in-situ shadowing
with high aspect-ratio pre-fabricated SiOx dielectric walls. Our technique
allows complete customization of each physical parameter of such hybrid
nanostructures, while performing the nanowire and superconductor growths
without breaking vacuum. Using this technique, we grew
super(S)-normal(N)-super(S) (SNS), NS and SNSNS junctions. We performed
cryogenic electron transport measurements revealing the presence of gate and
field tunable supercurrents in shadow junctions fabricated on in-plane SAG
nanowires. We further measured the superconducting gap and critical fields in
the hybrid nanostructures and the crossover from 2e to 1e periodicity in the
SNSNS junctions, as a proof of the usability of these hybrid nanostructures.

<h3>Aharonov-Bohm magnetism in open Fermi surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04310" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04310</a>
<br>
<i>Kostas Vilkelis, Ady Stern, Anton Akhmerov</i>
<br>
<br>
Orbital diamagnetism requires closed orbits according to the
Liftshiftz-Kosevich theory. Therefore, one might expect that open Fermi
surfaces do not have a diamagnetic response. Contrary to this expectation, we
show that open orbits in finite systems do contribute a magnetic response which
oscillates between diamagnetism and paramagnetism. The oscillations are similar
to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, because the oscillation phase is set by the number
of flux quanta through the area defined by the width of the sample and the
distance between adjacent atomic layers. The magnetic response originates from
the closed trajectories formed by counter-propagating open orbits coupled via
specular boundary reflections. The phenomenon acts as a probe of the phase
coherence of open electron trajectories.

<h3>Machine Learning Models Capture Plasmon Dynamics in Ag Nanoparticles</h3>

Highly energetic electron-hole pairs (hot carriers) formed from plasmon decay
in metallic nanostructures promise sustainable pathways for energy-harvesting
devices. However, efficient collection before thermalization remains an
obstacle for realization of their full energy generating potential. Addressing
this challenge requires detailed understanding of physical processes from
plasmon excitation in metal to their collection in a molecule or a
semiconductor, where atomistic theoretical investigation may be particularly
beneficial. Unfortunately, first-principles theoretical modeling of these
processes is extremely costly, limiting the analysis to systems with a few 100s
of atoms. Recent advances in machine learned interatomic potentials suggest
that dynamics can be accelerated with surrogate models which replace the full
solution of the Schroedinger Equation. Here, we modify an existing neural
network, Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network (HIP-NN), to
predict plasmon dynamics in Ag nanoparticles. We demonstrate the model's
capability to accurately predict plasmon dynamics in large nanoparticles of up
to 561 atoms not present in the training dataset. More importantly, with
machine learning models we gain a speed-up of about 200 times as compared with
the rt-TDDFT calculations when predicting important physical quantities such as
dynamic dipole moments in Ag55 and about 4000 times for extended nanoparticles
that are 10 times larger. This underscores the promise of future machine
learning accelerated electron/nuclear dynamics simulations for understanding
fundamental properties of plasmon-driven hot carrier devices.

<h3>Testing the variants of the Stokes-Einstein relation in the framework of  self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04325</a>
<br>
<i>Wanmei Zhang, Wenhan Zhang, Gan Ren</i>
<br>
<br>
The two functional forms, D~1/tau and D~T/tau, are usually adopted as the
variants of the Stokes-Einstein relation; where D is the diffusion constant,
tau the relaxation time and T the temperature. The self-consistent generalized
Langevin equation (SCGLE) theory is presented as an analytical tool to predict
the long time dynamics of colloids and molecular liquids. In this work, taking
truncated Lennard-Jones-like liquids as an example, the rationality of the two
variants were tested in the framework of the SCGLE theory. Our results indicate
that D~1/tau is a good variant of the Stokes-Einstein relation in the framework
of SCGLE theory; however, D~T/tau is not a good one but taking a fractional
from as D~(T/tau)^zeta with an exponent zeta is not equal to 1.0 even the
Stokes-Einstein relation is established in SCGLE theory.

<h3>Andreev spin qubit: A nonadiabatic geometric gate</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a hybrid structure of a ferromagnetic-insulator and a superconductor
connected by a weak link, which accommodates Andreev bound states whose spin
degeneracy is lifted due to the exchange interaction with the ferromagnet. The
resultant spin-resolved energy levels realize a two-state quantum system,
provided that a single electron is trapped in the bound state, i.e., an Andreev
spin qubit. The qubit state can be manipulated by controlling the magnetization
dynamics of the ferromagnet, which mediates the coupling between external
fields and the qubit. In particular, our hybrid structure provides a simple
platform to manipulate and control the spin qubit using spintronic techniques.
By employing a modified Hahn spin echo protocol for the magnetization dynamics,
we show that our Andreev spin qubit can realize a nonadiabatic geometric gate.

The motion of line defects (dislocations), the primary driver of plasticity,
has been studied for almost a century but one of the most fundamental questions
remains unsolved: what defines the maximum speed at which dislocations can
propagate? Early interpretations based on elasticity theory suggest that
dislocation motion should not exceed the transverse wave speed, but recent
models and atomistic simulations predict that transverse wave speed is a
forbidden speed but not the upper limit. We use femtosecond x-ray radiography
to observe how dislocations in shock-compressed single-crystalline diamond
travel with the plastic shock wavefront. The observed dislocation motions in
the diamond show that dislocations can move faster than the transverse wave
speed. As the ultrafast motion of dislocations causes unique behavior by which
solids strengthen or fail, understanding the upper limit of dislocation
mobility is critical to accurately model, predict, and control the mechanical
properties of materials under extreme conditions.

We analyze the transport properties of a Cooper pair splitter device made up
of two-point electrodes in contact with a ferromagnetic/superconductor (F/S)
junction built on the surface of a topological insulator. For the pair
potential of the S region we consider s- and d-wave symmetries, and for the F
region, we regard a magnetization vector normal to the TI surface. The
non-local transport along the F/S interface is mediated by chiral Majorana edge
states, with chirality controlled by the magnetization vector polarization. We
show that the crossed Andreev reflection amplitude slowly decays with the
separation of the electrodes for standard clean samples. Our system would reach
a maximum Cooper pair-splitting efficiency of 80% for a symmetrical voltage
configuration, even in high-temperature superconductors devices.

<h3>First-principles study of enhancement of perpendicular magnetic  anisotropy obtained by inserting an ultrathin LiF layer at an Fe/MgO  interface</h3>

Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is a key property of magnetoresistive
random access memory (MRAM). To increase areal density of MRAM it is important
to find a way to enhance the PMA. Recently a strong enhancement of the PMA by
inserting an ultrathin LiF layer at an Fe/MgO interface was reported [T. Nozaki
et al., NPG Asia Materials (2022) 14: 5]. To understand the origin of the
observed enhancement of the PMA we perform first-principles calculations of
magetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of the following four kind of
multilayer structures: Fe/MgO, Fe/LiF/MgO, Fe/FeO/MgO, and Fe/FeF/LiF/MgO. We
find that the MAEs of the Fe/LiF/MgO and the Fe/FeF/LiF/MgO structures are
almost the same as that of the Fe/MgO structure, while the MAE of the
Fe/FeO/MgO structure is less than a half of that of the Fe/MgO structure. The
results show that the major origin of the enhancement of the PMA obtained by
inserting an ultrathin LiF layer at an Fe/MgO interface is the suppression of
the mixing of Fe and O atoms at the interface. We also find that the in-plane
Fe-F coupling gives a positive contribution to the MAE while the in-plane Fe-O
coupling gives a negative contribution. The results are useful for designing of
high-PMA materials.

Intrinsic resistivity changes associated with charge density wave (CDW) phase
transitions in 1$T$-TaS$_2$ hold promise for non-volatile memory and computing
devices based on the principle of phase change memory. Intermediate resistance
states, which offer distinctive opportunities for neuromorphic computing, have
been observed in 1$T$-TaS$_2$ but the metastability responsible for this
behavior makes the nature of multistate switching unpredictable. Here, we
demonstrate the synthesis of nanothick verti-lateral 1$H$-TaS$_2$/1$T$-TaS$_2$
heterostructures in which the number of endotaxial metallic 1$H$-TaS$_2$
monolayers dictates the number of high-temperature resistance transitions in
1$T$-TaS$_2$ lamellae. Further, we also observe heterochirality in the CDW
superlattice structure, which is also modulated in concert with the resistivity
steps. This thermally-induced polytype conversion nucleates at folds and kinks
where interlayer translations that relax local strain favorably align 1$H$ and
1$T$ layers. This work positions endotaxial TaS2 heterostructures as prime
candidates for non-volatile device schemes implementing coupled switching of
structure, chirality, and resistance.

Dynamic homogenization theories are powerful tools for describing and
understanding the behavior of heterogeneous media such as composites and
metamaterials. However, a major challenge in the dynamic homogenization theory
is determining Green's function of these media, which makes it difficult to
predict their effective constitutive relations, particularly for the
finite-size and/or non-periodic media in real-world applications. In this
paper, we present a formulation for finding the elastodynamic effective
constitutive relations for general heterogeneous media, including finite-size
and non-periodic ones, by taking into account boundary terms in the
Hashin-Shtrikman principle. Our proposed formulation relies on the
infinite-body Green's function of a reference homogeneous medium, making it
free from the difficulty of determining Green's function even for the
homogenization of finite-size media. Additionally, we demonstrate the universal
applicability of this formulation for both random and deterministic
heterogeneous media. This work contributes to a better understanding of the
homogenization theory and the design of next-generation metamaterials that
require the accurate prediction of effective material characteristics for
dynamic wave manipulation under desired operating environments.

Pressure-induced phase transformations (PTs) between numerous phases of Si,
the most important electronic material, have been studied for decades. This is
not the case for plastic strain-induced PTs. Here, we revealed in-situ various
unexpected plastic strain-induced PT phenomena. Thus, for 100 nm Si,
strain-induced PT Si-I to Si-II (and Si-I to Si-III) initiates at 0.4 GPa (0.6
GPa) versus 16.2 GPa ($\infty$, since it does not occur) under hydrostatic
conditions; for 30 nm Si, it is 6.1 GPa versus $\infty$. The predicted
theoretical correlation between the direct and inverse Hall-Petch effect of the
grain size on the yield strength and the minimum pressure for strain-induced PT
is confirmed for the appearance of Si-II. Retaining Si-II at ambient pressure
and obtaining reverse Si-II to Si-I PT are achieved, demonstrating the
possibilities of manipulating different synthetic paths.

<br>
For a model with many-to-one connectivity it is widely expected that
mean-field theory captures the many-particle $N\to\infty$ limit, and that
higher-order cumulant expansions of the Heisenberg equations converge to this
same limit whilst providing improved approximations at finite $N$. Here we show
that this is in fact not always the case. Instead, whether mean-field theory
correctly describes the large-$N$ limit depends on how the model parameters
scale with $N$, and we show that convergence of cumulant expansions may be
non-uniform across even and odd orders. Further, even when a given order of
cumulant expansion does recover the correct limit, the error of higher-order
cumulant expansions is not monotonic with $N$ and may exceed that of mean-field
theory.

The realization of single-molecule thermal conductance measurements has
driven the need for theoretical tools to describe conduction processes that
occur over atomistic length scales. In macroscale systems, the principle that
is typically used to understand thermal conductivity is Fourier's law. At
molecular length scales, however, deviations from Fourier's law are common in
part because microscale thermal transport properties typically depend on the
complex interplay between multiple heat conduction mechanisms. Here, the
thermal transport properties that arise from electron transfer across a thermal
gradient in a molecular conduction junction are examined theoretically. We
illustrate how transport in a model junction is affected by varying the
electronic structure and length of the molecular bridge in the junction as well
as the strength of the coupling between the bridge and its surrounding
environment. Three findings are of note: First, the transport properties can
vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the molecular bridge and
its environment; second, the system's thermal conductance commonly deviates
from Fourier's law; and third, in properly engineered systems, the magnitude of
electron hopping thermal conductance is similar to what has been measured in
single-molecule devices.

<h3>Quantum anomalous Hall insulator in ionic Rashba lattice of correlated  electrons</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, we propose an exactly solvable two-dimensional lattice model of
strongly correlated electrons that realizes a quantum anomalous Hall insulator
with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. First, we show that the interplay of ionic
potential, Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting leads to the
appearance of quantum anomalous Hall effect. Next, we calculate in an exact
manner Chern number for the correlated system where electron-electron
interactions are introduced in the spirit of Hatsugai-Kohmoto model using two
complementary methods, one relying on the properties of many-body groundstate
and the other utilizing single-particle Green's function, and subsequently we
determine stability regions. By leveraging the presence of inversion symmetry
we find boundaries between topological and trivial phases on the analytical
ground. Notably, we show that in the presence of correlations onset of
topological phase is no longer signalled by a spectral gap closing. We provide
a clear understanding of this inherently many-body feature by pinpointing that
the lowest energy excited states in the correlated system are no longer of the
single-particle nature and thus are not captured by a spectral function.

Two-dimensional ($2$D) semi-Dirac systems, such as $2$D black phosphorus and
arsenene, can exhibit a rich topological phase transition between insulating,
semi-Dirac, and band inversion phases when subjected to an external modulation.
How these phase transitions manifest within the quantum transport and shot
noise signatures remain an open question thus far. Here, we show that the Fano
factor converges to the universal $F\approx0.179$ at the semi-Dirac phase, and
transits between the sub-Poissonian ($F\approx1/3$) and the Poissonian shot
noise ($F\approx1$) limit at the band inversion and the insulating phase,
respectively. Furthermore, the conductance of $2$D semi-Dirac system converges
to the contrasting limit of $G/G_0 \rightarrow 1/d$ and $G/G_0 \rightarrow0$ at
the band inversion and the insulating phases, respectively. The quantum
tunneling spectra exhibits a peculiar coexistence of massless and massive Dirac
quasiparticles in the band inversion regime, thus providing a versatile sandbox
to study the tunneling behavior of various Dirac quasiparticles. These findings
reveal the rich interplay between band topology and quantum transport
signatures, which may serve as smoking gun signatures for the experimental
studies of semi-Dirac systems near topological phase transition.

Mesoscale simulations of discrete defects in metals provide an ideal
framework to investigate the micro-scale mechanisms governing the plastic
deformation under high thermal and mechanical loading conditions. To bridge
size and time-scale while limiting computational effort, typically the concept
of representative volume elements (RVEs) is employed. This approach considers
the microstructure evolution in a volume that is representative of the overall
material behavior. However, in settings with complex thermal and mechanical
loading histories careful consideration of the impact of modeling constraints
in terms of time scale and simulation domain on predicted results is required.
We address the representation of heterogeneous dislocation structure formation
in simulation volumes using the example of residual stress formation during
cool-down of laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) of AISI 316L stainless steel. This
is achieved by a series of large-scale three-dimensional discrete dislocation
dynamics (DDD) simulations assisted by thermo-mechanical finite element
modeling of the LPBF process. Our results show that insufficient size of
periodic simulation domains can result in dislocation patterns that reflect the
boundaries of the primary cell. More pronounced dislocation interaction
observed for larger domains highlight the significance of simulation domain
constraints for predicting mechanical properties. We formulate criteria that
characterize representative volume elements by capturing the conformity of the
dislocation structure to the bulk material. This work provides a basis for
future investigations of heterogeneous microstructure formation in mesoscale
simulations of bulk material behavior.

The temperature-dependent composition and phase formation during physical

approach. Considering the Mg and Ca sublimation fluxes calculated based on the

experimentally observed synthesis temperature trends in thin film composition
and phase formation are reproduced. The model is a significant step towards
understanding how synthesis parameters control composition and thereby phase
formation in PVD of metals with high vapor pressures.

Indenofluorenes are non-benzenoid conjugated hydrocarbons that have received
great interest owing to their unusual electronic structure and potential
applications in non-linear optics and photovoltaics. Here, we report the
generation of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene, the final and yet unreported
parent indenofluorene regioisomer, on various surfaces by cleavage of two C-H
bonds in 7,12-dihydro indeno[1,2-a]fluorene through voltage pulses applied by
the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force
microscope. On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2-a]fluorene is in the neutral
charge state, while it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic
states on the lower work function surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and
Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits either of two
ground states: an open-shell {\pi}-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet
by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory
calculations, or a closed-shell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the
as-indacene core. Switching between open- and closed-shell states of a single
molecule is observed by changing its adsorption site on NaCl.

This paper reports the first experimental observation of phonons and their
softening on single crystalline LaPt$_2$Si$_2$ via inelastic neutron
scattering. From the temperature dependence of the phonon frequency in close
proximity to the charge-density wave (CDW) $q$-vector, we obtain a CDW
transition temperature of T$_{CDW}$ = 230 K and a critical exponent $\beta$ =
0.28 $\pm$ 0.03. This value is suggestive of a non-conventional critical
behavior for the CDW phase transition in LaPt$_2$Si$_2$, compatible with a
scenario of CDW discommensuration (DC). The DC would be caused by the existence
of two CDWs in this material, propagating separately in the non equivalent
(Si1-Pt2-Si1) and (Pt1-Si2-Pt1) layers respectively, with transition
temperatures T$_{CDW-1}$ = 230 K and T$_{CDW-2}$ = 110 K. A strong
$q$-dependence of the electron-phonon coupling has been identified as the
driving mechanism for the CDW transition at T$_{CDW-1}$ = 230 K while a CDW
with 3-dimensional character, and Fermi surface quasi-nesting as a driving
mechanism, is suggested for the transition at T$_{CDW-2}$ = 110 K. Our results
clarify some aspects of the CDW transition in LaPt$_2$Si$_2$, which have been
so far misinterpreted by both theoretical predictions and experimental
observations, and give direct insight into its actual temperature dependence.

We study the Josephson current on a symmetric [001]-tilt grain boundary (GB)
of a $d$-wave superconductor on a lattice model. In addition to the suppression
of the maximum Josephson current associated with the internal phase change of
the $d$-wave pair potential predicted in continuum models, we find a unique
phase interference effect due to the folding of the Brillouin zone. In
particular, the resulting maximum Josephson current at low tilted angle regions
tends to be suppressed more than that in preexisting theories. Since similar
suppressions of the critical current at GBs are reported in several
experimental works, the present model can serve as a guide to clarify the
complicated transport mechanism in GBs.

<br>
<br>
Simple route of engineering topological phases for any desired value of
winding and Chern numbers is found in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model by
adding a further neighbor hopping term of varying distances. It is known that
the standard SSH model yields a single topological phase with winding number,
$\nu=1$. In this study it is shown that how one can generate topological phases
with any values of winding numbers, for examples, $\nu=\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm
3,\cdots,$ with the presence of a single further neighbor term which preserves
inversion, particle-hole and chiral symmetries. Quench dynamics of the
topological and trivial phases are studied in the presence of a specific
nonlinear term. Another version of SSH model with additional modulating nearest
neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameters was introduced before
those exhibit a single topological phase characterized by Chern number,
$\mathcal C=\pm 1$. Standard form of inversion, particle-hole and chiral
symmetries are broken in this model. Here this model has been studied in the
presence of several types of parametrization among which for a special case
system is found to yield a series of phases with Chern numbers, $\mathcal C=\pm
1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\cdots.$ In another parametrization, multiple crossing within the
edge states energy lines are found in both trivial and topological phases.
Topological phase diagrams are drawn for every case. Emergence of spurious
topological phases is also reported.

<br>
<br>
Here, we analyze in a non-contact fashion charge carrier mobility as a
function of injection level and temperature in silicon by time resolved THz
spectroscopy (TRTS) and parametrize our data by the classical semi-empirical
models of Klaassen and Dorkel & Leturcq. Our experimental results are in very
good agreement with the pioneering works of Krausse and D\"annhauser analyzing
this phenomena by employing contact-based methods. This agreement, that
validates our methodology, can only be achieved by considering charge carrier
diffusion effects following above bandgap near-surface pump photo-excitation of
the sample. From our results, obtained over a large range of injection levels,
we conclude that the model of Klaassen is the best on describing the collected
data at room temperature. Furthermore, we analyze by TRTS the dependence of
charge carrier mobility with temperature for a fixed injection level. Once
more, the parametrization made by the classical model of Klaassen describe our
data appropriately even without the necessity of applying any fitting
parameters (just with the charge carrier density as an input). In this respect,
our work supports the validity of the model and parametrization proposed by
Klaassen, and also illustrate how TRTS can be reliably employed for the
quantitative determination of mobility in semiconductors as a function of key
parameters as injection level and temperature.

Amorphous solids are known to fail catastrophically and in some situations,
nano-scaled cavities are believed to play a significant role in the failure. In
a recent work, using numerical simulations, we have shown the correspondence
between cavitation under uniform expansion of amorphous solids and the yielding
under shear. In this study, we probe the stability of spatially-homogeneous
states sampled from expansion trajectories to alternate modes of driving, viz.
macroscopic cyclic shear or local random deformation via activity. We find
that, under cyclic shear and activity, the cavitation instabilities can occur
in expanded states at much higher densities than under pure uniform-expansion,
and the shift in density is determined by the magnitude of the secondary
deformation. We also show that barriers to cavitation on the energy landscape
are much smaller for cyclic-shear and activity than seen under expansion.
Further, we also analyse the spatial manifestation of cavitation and
investigate whether large scale irreversible plasticity can set in due to the
combination of expansion and the secondary deformation. Overall, our study
reveals the interplay between expansion and other deformation modes leading to
cavitation instabilities and the existence of abundant relaxation pathways for
such processes.

Magnetization reversal and domain wall dynamics in Pt/Co/AlOx trilayers have
been tuned by He+ ion irradiation. Fluences up to 1.5x10$^{15}$ ions/cm$^2$
strongly decrease the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), without
affecting neither the spontaneous magnetization nor the strength of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). This confirms the robustness of the
DMI interaction against interfacial chemical intermixing, already predicted by
theory. In parallel with the decrease of the PMA in the irradiated samples, a
strong decrease of the depinning field is observed. This allows the domain
walls to reach large maximum velocities with lower magnetic fields with respect
to those needed for the pristine films. Decoupling PMA from DMI can therefore
be beneficial for the design of low energy devices based on domain wall
dynamics. When the samples are irradiated with larger He+ fluences, the
magnetization gets close to the out-of-plane/in-plane reorientation transition
where 100nm size magnetic skyrmions are stabilized. We observe that as the He+
fluence increases, the skyrmion size decreases while these magnetic textures
become more stable against the application of an external magnetic field.

Orbital current has emerged over the past years as one of the key novel
concepts in magnetotransport. Here, we demonstrate that laser pulses can be
used to generate large and robust non-relativistic orbital currents in systems
where the inversion symmetry is broken by the orbital Rashba effect. By
referring to model and first principles tools, we demonstrate that orbital
Rashba effect, accompanied by crystal field splitting, can mediate robust
orbital photocurrents without a need for spin-orbit interaction even in
metallic systems. We show that such non-relativistic orbital photocurrents are
translated into derivative photocurrents of spin when relativistic effects are
taken into account. We thus promote orbital photocurrents as a promising
platform for optical generation of currents of angular momentum, and discuss
their possible applications.

Spatial, momentum and energy separation of electronic spins in condensed
matter systems guides the development of novel devices where spin-polarized
current is generated and manipulated. Recent attention on a set of previously
overlooked symmetry operations in magnetic materials leads to the emergence of
a new type of spin splitting besides the well-studied Zeeman, Rashba and
Dresselhaus effects, enabling giant and momentum dependent spin polarization of
energy bands on selected antiferromagnets independent of relativistic
spin-orbit interaction. Despite the ever-growing theoretical predictions, the
direct spectroscopic proof of such spin splitting is still lacking. Here, we
provide solid spectroscopic and computational evidence for the existence of
such materials. In the noncoplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$, the in-plane
components of spin are found to be antisymmetric about the high-symmetry planes
of the Brillouin zone, comprising a plaid-like spin texture in the
antiferromagnetic ground state. Such an unconventional spin pattern, further
found to diminish at the high-temperature paramagnetic state, stems from the
intrinsic antiferromagnetic order instead of the relativistic spin-orbit
coupling. Our finding demonstrates a new type of spin-momentum locking with a
nonrelativistic origin, placing antiferromagnetic spintronics on a firm basis
and paving the way for studying exotic quantum phenomena in related materials.

<br>
We explore the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard
system as a sensitive testbed for the capabilities of the time-dependent
two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) theory to accurately describe
time-dependent correlated systems. We follow the time evolution of the
out-of-equilibrium finite-size Fermi-Hubbard model initialized by a quench over
extended periods of time. By comparison with exact calculations for small
systems and with matrix product state (MPS) calculations for larger systems but
limited to short times, we demonstrate that the TD2RDM theory can accurately
account for the non-equilibrium dynamics in the regime from weak to moderately
strong inter-particle correlations. We find that the quality of the approximate
reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant (or correlation) required for the
closure of the equations of motion for the reduced density matrix is key to the
accuracy of the numerical TD2RDM results. We identify the size of the
dynamically induced three-particle correlations and the amplitude of cross
correlations between the two- and three-particle cumulants as critical
parameters that control the accuracy of the TD2RDM theory when current
state-of-the art reconstruction functionals are employed.

<br>
<br>
We have studied the effect of He$^+$ irradiation on the dynamics of chiral
domain walls in Pt/Co/AlOx trilayers in the creep regime. The irradiation leads
to a strong decrease of the depinning field and a non-monotonous change of the
effective pinning barriers. The variations of domain wall dynamics result
essentially from the strong decrease of the effective anisotropy constant,
which increases the domain wall width. The latter is found to present a perfect
scaling with the length-scale of the interaction between domain wall and
disorder, $\xi$. On the other hand, the strength of the domain wall-disorder
interaction, $f_{pin}$, is weakly impacted by the irradiation, suggesting that
the length-scales of the disorder fluctuation remain smaller than the domain
wall width.

Among antiferromagnetic materials, Mn$_2$Au is one of the most intensively
studied, and it serves as a very popular platform for testing various ideas
related to antiferromagnetic magnetotransport and dynamics. Since recently,
this material has also attracted considerable interest in the context of
optical properties and optically-driven antiferromagnetic switching. In this
work, we use first principles methods to explore the physics of charge
photocurrents, spin photocurrents and inverse Faraday effect in
antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Au. We predict the symmetry and magnitude of these
effects, and speculate that they can be used for tracking the dynamics of
staggered moments during switching. Our calculations reveal the emergence of
large photocurrents of spin in collinear Mn$_2$Au, whose properties can be
understood as a result of a non-linear optical version of spin Hall effect $-$
which we refer to as the $\textit{photospin Hall effect}$ encoded into the
relation between the driving charge and resulting spin photocurrents. Moreover,
we suggest that even a very small canting in Mn$_2$Au can give rise to colossal
spin photocurrents which are $\textit{chiral}$ in flavor. We conclude that the
combination of staggered magnetization with the structural and electronic
properties of this material results in a unique blend of prominent
photocurrents, which makes Mn$_2$Au a unique platform for advanced
optospintronics applications.

<h3>Proximity effect and inverse proximity effect in a  topological-insulator/iron-based-superconductor heterostructure</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the proximity effect and the inverse proximity effect
in a topological insulator/iron-based superconductor heterostructure based on
the microscopic model. The superconducting order parameter is self-consistently
calculated. Its magnitude decreases when the coupling of these two systems
increases. The induced pairing order parameter exhibits negative and positive
values, while the negative pairing near the $\Gamma=(0,0)$ point is dominant.
This parameter has twofold symmetry and includes an $s$-wave component and a
$d$-wave component. The magnitude of the induced pairing order parameter has a
maximal value at the coupling strength $t_p=0.3\approx 0.06$ eV. The spectral
function and the local density of states are calculated and may be used to
probe the proximity effect. We also discuss the feedback of the topological
insulator to the iron-based superconductor layer. The normal-state Fermi
surface is distorted by the coupling, and additional Fermi pockets are induced.
An effective spin-orbit interaction term is induced. In the superconducting
state, the previous fourfold symmetry of the order parameter is broken, and a
$d$-wave component pairing term is also induced. Our main results can be well
understood by analyzing the Fermi surfaces of the original systems.

A unified treatment of slip and twinning in Bravais lattices is given,
focussing on the case of cubic symmetry, and using the Ericksen energy well
formulation, so that interfaces correspond to rank-one connections between the
infinitely many crystallographically equivalent energy wells. The slips and
twins minimizing shear magnitude for cubic lattices are rigorously calculated,
and the conjugates of these and other slips analyzed. It is observed that all
rank-one connections between the energy wells for fcc can be obtained
explicitly from those for bcc (and vice versa).74N15, 74G65

<h3>Nanoscale perspective on the stress-corrosion cracking behavior of a  peak-aged 7XXX-Al alloy</h3>

<br>
<br>
High strength 7xxx Al-alloys are currently commonly used in aerospace and are
expected to be increasingly employed in the automotive sector for weight
reduction purposes. These alloys can however be sensitive to stress-corrosion
cracking (SCC) depending on temper and loading conditions. Both the alloy's
grain structure and composition are believed to play a key role in determining
sensitivity to SCC. Here, we study at the nanometer scale the evolution of the
microstructure near stress corrosion cracks on two different model variants of
the 7140 aluminum alloy. We performed double cantilever beam (DCB) crack growth
tests in hot (70{\deg}C) humid air, on samples extracted at quarter-thickness
(T/4) and mid-thickness (T/2) and heat treated to a non-industrial, SCC
sensitive T6 condition. The sample at T/4 shows a lower KISCC along with
flatter grains and a higher solute content, whereas both samples exhibit
similar crack growth rates at higher stress intensities. We report on
precipitate dissolution and matrix solute enrichment near the crack tips, with
the T/4 position presenting the higher increase in solute levels. The near
grain boundary microstructure ahead of the crack is modified, with evidence of
precipitate dissolution and transport of solutes towards the stress-corrosion
crack tip. These results agree with a recent report on another 7xxx Al-alloy
after SCC in Cl-solution, supporting the possibility that these mechanisms are
generally occurring. We relate our findings with the measured SCC behavior and
provide an array of possible mechanisms that could be widely applicable in SCC
of high strength Al-alloys.

<h3>Effects of a uniform magnetic field on twisted graphene nanoribbons</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the present work, the relativistic quantum motion of massless fermions in
a helicoidal graphene nanoribbon under the influence of a uniform magnetic
field is investigated. Considering a uniform magnetic field ($B$) aligned along
the axis of helicoid, this problem is explored in the context of Dirac equation
in a curved space-time. As this system does not support exact solutions due to
considered background, the bound-state solutions and local density of state
(LDOS) are obtained numerically by means of the Numerov method. The combined
effects of width of the nanoribbon ($D$), length of ribbon ($L$), twist
parameter ($\omega$) and $B$ on the equations of motion and local density of
states (LDOS) are analyzed and discussed. It is verified that the presence of
$B$ produces a constant minimum value of local density of state on the axis of
helicoid, which is possible only for values large enough of $\omega$, in
contrast to the case for $B=0$ already studied in the literature.

<h3>Spin-valve nature and giant coercivity of a ferrimagnetic spin semimetal  Mn$_2$IrGa</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin semimetals are amongst the most recently discovered new class of
spintronic materials, which exhibit a band gap in one spin channel and
semimetallic feature in the other, thus facilitating tunable spin transport.
Here, we report Mn$_2$IrGa to be a candidate material for spin semimetal along
with giant coercivity and spin-valve characteristics using a combined
experimental and theoretical study. The alloy crystallizes in an inverse
Heusler structure with a para-to ferri-magnetic transition at $T_\mathrm{C}
\sim$ 243 K. It shows a giant coercive field of about 8.5 kOe (at 2 K). The
negative temperature coefficient, relatively low magnitude and small variation
of electrical resistivity with temperature suggest the semimetallic character
of the alloy. This is further supported by our specific heat measurement.
Magnetoresistance (MR) confirms an irreversible nature (with its magnitude of
about 1\% in the measured $T$-range) along with a change of sign across the
magnetic transition indicating the potentiality of Mn$_2$IrGa in magnetic
switching applications. In addition, asymmetric nature of MR in the positive
and negative field cycles is indicative of spin-valve characteristics. Our
ab-initio calculations confirm an inverse Heusler structure with ferrimagnetic
ordering to be the lowest energy state for Mn$_2$IrGa, with a saturation
magnetization of 2 $\mu_\mathrm{B}$. $<100>$ is found to be the easy magnetic
axis with considerable magneto-crystalline energy. A large positive Berry flux
at/around $\Gamma$ point is responsible for a reasonably large anomalous Hall
conductivity ($\sim$-180 S/cm).

<h3>Current-induced spin polarization at metallic surfaces from  first-principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04666" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04666</a>
<br>
<i>Andrea Droghetti, Ilya V. Tokatly</i>
<br>
<br>
We present the results of first-principles calculations based on density
functional theory estimating the magnitude of the current-induced spin
polarization (CISP) at the surfaces of the $5d$ transition metals with fcc and
bcc crystal structures. We predict that the largest surface CISP occurs for W
and Ta, whereas CISP is considerably weaker for Pt and Au surfaces. We then
discuss how CISP emerges over a length scale equal to few atomic layers as
opposed to the spin accumulation characteristic of the SHE, which is related to
the materials' spin diffusion length. Finally, using our estimates for the CISP
magnitude, we suggest that the spin density appearing near W surfaces in
experiments is mostly due to CISP, whereas that at Pt surfaces stems from the
Hall effect.

<h3>Floquet topological superconductors with many Majorana edge modes:  topological invariants, entanglement spectrum and bulk-edge correspondence</h3>

<br>
<br>
One-dimensional Floquet topological superconductors possess two types of
degenerate Majorana edge modes at zero and $\pi$ quasieneriges, leaving more
room for the design of boundary time crystals and quantum computing schemes
than their static counterparts. In this work, we discover Floquet
superconducting phases with large topological invariants and arbitrarily many
Majorana edge modes in periodically driven Kitaev chains. Topological winding
numbers defined for the Floquet operator and Floquet entanglement Hamiltonian
are found to generate consistent predictions about the phase diagram, bulk-edge
correspondence and numbers of zero and $\pi$ Majorana edge modes of the system
under different driving protocols. The bipartite entanglement entropy further
show non-analytic behaviors around the topological transition point between
different Floquet superconducting phases. These general features are
demonstrated by investigating the Kitaev chain with periodically kicked pairing
or hopping amplitudes. Our discovery reveals the rich topological phases and
many Majorana edge modes that could be brought about by periodic driving fields
in one-dimensional superconducting systems. It further introduces a unified
description for a class of Floquet topological superconductors from their
quasienergy bands and entanglement properties.

<br>
We investigate quantum order by disorder in a frustrated spin nanotube formed
by wrapping a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model at 45$^\circ$ around a cylinder.
Using Schwinger boson theory and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG),
we have computed the ground-state phase diagram to reveal a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
phase in which collinear spin stripes form a right or left handed helix around
the nanotube. We have derived an analytic estimate for the critical
$\eta_c=J_1/2J_2$ of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ helical phase transition, which is in
agreement with the DMRG results. By evaluating the entanglement spectrum and
nonlocal string order parameters we discuss the topology of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-helical phase.

<br>
Magnonic nano-devices exploit magnons -- quanta of spin waves -- to transmit
and process information within a single integrated platform that has the
potential to outperform traditional semiconductor-based electronics for low
power applications. The main missing cornerstone of this information
nanotechnology is an efficient scheme for the direct amplification of
propagating spin waves. The recent discovery of spin-orbit torque provided an
elegant mechanism for propagation losses compensation. While partial
compensation of the spin-wave damping has allowed for spin-wave signal
modulation, true amplification - the exponential increase in the spin-wave
intensity during propagation - has so far remained elusive. Here we evidence
the operating conditions to achieve unambiguous amplification using clocked
nanoseconds -long spin-orbit torque pulses in sub-micrometer wide magnonic
waveguides, where the effective magnetization has been engineered to be close
to zero to suppress the detrimental magnon-magnon scattering. As a result, we
achieve an exponential increase in the intensity of propagating spin waves up
to 500 % at a propagation distance of several micrometers. These results pave
the way towards the implementation of energy efficient, cascadable magnonic
architectures for wave-based information processing and complex on-chip
computation.

In this work, theoretical investigation of cubic Pm-3m phase RbGeO$_3$
germanate perovskite using plain wave basis, density function theory (DFT) is
conducted. DFT modelling calculations, clearly shows that this perovskite
exhibits thermodynamic and dynamical stability in the cubic phase, identical to
that of high pressure perovskite cubic SrGeO$_3$. As from the computed phonon
dispersions this system also exhibits anti-ferro distortive (AFD)
instabilities, much similar as that observed in case of cubic SrGeO$_3$ at
ground state conditions. Hence, from this study we conclude that ideal cubic
perovskite phase of RbGeO$_3$ can be synthesized under identical high-pressure
environment as that reported for SrGeO$_3$ in the literature. Further, we
report the fundamental opto-electronic properties of this material system from
first principles DFT calculations, which are not yet reported in the literature
and as per calculated properties this perovskite material can be utilized as
efficient transparent conductive oxide for next generation solar cells, as well
as for IR absorption based sensing applications.

We establish the existence of a cusp in the curvature of a solid sheet at its
contact with a liquid subphase. We study two configurations in floating sheets
where the solid-vapor-liquid contact line is a straight line and a circle,
respectively. In the former case, a rectangular sheet is lifted at its edge,
whereas in the latter a gas bubble is injected beneath a floating sheet. We
show that in both geometries the derivative of the sheet's curvature is
discontinuous. We demonstrate that the boundary condition at the contact is
identical in these two geometries, even though the shape of the contact line
and the stress distribution in the sheet are sharply different.

Levin-Wen string-net models provide a construction of (2+1)D topologically
ordered phases of matter with anyonic localized excitations described by the
{Drinfeld} center of a unitary fusion category. Anyon condensation is a
mechanism for phase transitions between (2+1)D topologically ordered phases. We
construct an extension of Levin-Wen models in which tuning a parameter
implements anyon condensation. We also describe the classification of anyons in
Levin-Wen models via representation theory of the tube algebra, and use a
variant of the tube algebra to classify low-energy localized excitations in the
condensed phase.

<h3>Creep response of athermal amorphous solids under imposed shear stress</h3>

Yield stress materials fail when the imposed stress crosses a critical
threshold. A well-known dynamical response to the applied stress is the
phenomenon of creep where the cumulative deformation grows sublinearly with
time, prior to failure or arrest. Using extensive molecular dynamics
simulations, we study such response for a model amorphous system, in the
athermal limit, and probe how the annealing history of the initial state
determines the observed behaviour to an applied shear stress. Further, we
analyze the microscopic dynamics in the vicinity of the yield threshold, using
large systems, and characterize the spatiotemporal signatures towards arrest or
flow, at different scales.

<h3>Unfolding a composed ensemble of energy spectra using singular value  decomposition</h3>

<br>
<i>Richard Berkovits</i>
<br>
<br>
In comparing the behavior of an energy spectrum to the predictions of random
matrix theory one must transform the spectrum such that the averaged level
spacing is constant, a procedure known as unfolding. Once energy spectrums
belong to an ensemble where there are large realization-to-realization
fluctuations the canonical methods for unfolding fail. Here we show that
singular value decomposition can be used even for the challenging situations
where the ensemble is composed out of realizations originating from a different
range of parameters resulting in a non-monotonous local density of states. This
can be useful in experimental situations for which the physical parameters can
not be tightly controlled, of for situations for which the local density of
states is strongly fluctuating.

<h3>Quantum liquid droplets in Bose mixtures with weak disorder</h3>

<i>Karima Abbas, Abdelaali Boudjemaa</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the properties of self-bound liquid droplets of three-dimensional
Bose mixtures in a weak random potential with Gaussian correlation function at
both zero and finite temperatures. Using the Bogoliubov theory, we derive
useful formulas for the ground-state energy, the equilibrium density, the
depletion, and the anomalous density of the droplet. The quantum fluctuation
induced by the disorder known as the glassy fraction is also systematically
computed. At finite temperature, we calculate the free energy, the thermal
equilibrium density, and the critical temperature in terms of the disorder
parameters. We show that when the strength and the correlation length of the
disorder potential exceed a certain critical value, the droplet evaporates and
is eventually entirely destroyed. We calculate the density profiles of this
exotic state by means of numerical simulations of the corresponding generalized
disorder Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Our predictions reveal that as the strength
of the disorder gets larger, the atomic density varies rapidly in the plateau
region. We point out in addition that the peculiar interplay of the disorder
and the repulsive Lee-Huang-Yang corrections play a pivotal role in the
collective modes of the self-bound droplet.

<br>
<br>
The industrialization of Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) is challenged by
the undesirable microstructures and high residual stresses originating from the
fast and complex solidification process. Non-destructive assessment of the
mechanical performance controlling deformation patterning is therefore
critical. Here, we use Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to non-destructively
map the 3D intragranular orientation and strain variations throughout a surface
breaking grain within a directed energy deposition nickel superalloy. DFXM
results reveal a highly heterogenous 3D microstructure in terms of the local
orientation and lattice strain. The grain comprises $\approx$ 5$\mu$m-sized
cells with alternating strain states, as high as 5 $\times 10^{-3}$, and
orientation differences <0.5{\deg} . The DFXM results are compared to Electron
Backscatter Diffraction measurements of the same grain from its cut-off
surface. We discuss the microstructure developments during LAM, rationalising
the development of the deformation patterning from the extreme thermal
gradients during processing and the susceptibility for solute segregation.

The interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations in the vicinity of a
quantum critical point (QCP) gives rise to various regimes or phases with
distinct quantum character. In this work, we show that the R\'enyi entropy is a
precious tool to characterize the phase diagram of critical systems not only
around the QCP but also away from it, thanks to its capability to detect the
emergence of local order at finite temperature. For an efficient evaluation of
the R\'enyi entropy, we introduce a new algorithm based on a path integral
Langevin dynamics combined with a previously proposed thermodynamic integration
method built on regularized paths. We apply this framework to study the
critical behavior of a linear chain of anharmonic oscillators, a particular
realization of the $\phi^4$ model. We fully resolved its phase diagram, as a
function of both temperature and interaction strength. At finite temperature,
we find a sequence of three regimes - para, disordered and quasi long-range
ordered -, met as the interaction is increased. The R\'enyi entropy divergence
coincides with the crossover between the para and disordered regime, which
shows no temperature dependence. The occurrence of quasi long-range order, on
the other hand, is temperature dependent. The two crossover lines merge in
proximity of the QCP, at zero temperature, where the R\'enyi entropy is sharply
peaked. Via its subsystem-size scaling, we confirm that the transition belongs
to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. This phenomenology is expected
to happen in all $\phi^4$-like systems, as well as in the elusive water ice
transition across phases VII, VIII and X.

<h3>Projective cluster-additive transformation for quantum lattice models</h3>

<i>M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct a projection-based cluster-additive transformation that
block-diagonalizes wide classes of lattice Hamiltonians
$\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_0 +V$. Its cluster additivity is an essential
ingredient to set up perturbative or non-perturbative linked-cluster expansions
for degenerate excitation subspaces of $\mathcal{H}_0$. Our transformation
generalizes the minimal transformation known amongst others under the names
Takahashi's transformation, Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, des Cloiseaux
effective Hamiltonian, canonical van Vleck effective Hamiltonian or two-block
orthogonalization method. The effective cluster-additive Hamiltonian and the
transformation for a given subspace of $\mathcal{H}$, that is adiabatically
connected to the eigenspace of $\mathcal{H}_0$ with eigenvalue $e_0^n$, solely
depends on the eigenspaces of $\mathcal{H}$ connected to $e_0^m$ with
$e_0^m\leq e_0^n$. In contrast, other cluster-additive transformations like the
multi-block orthognalization method or perturbative continuous unitary
transformations need a larger basis. This can be exploited to implement the
transformation efficiently both perturbatively and non-perturbatively. As a
benchmark, we perform perturbative and non-perturbative linked-cluster
expansions in the low-field ordered phase of the transverse-field Ising model
on the square lattice for single spin-flips and two spin-flip bound-states.

<br>
Quasiparticle (QP) effects play a significant role in the coherence and
fidelity of superconducting quantum circuits. The Andreev bound states of high
transparency Josephson junctions can act as low-energy traps for QPs, providing
a mechanism for studying the dynamics and properties of both the QPs and the
junction. We study the trapping and clearing of QPs from the Andreev bound
states of epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions incorporated in a
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) galvanically shorting a
superconducting resonator to ground. We use a neighboring voltage-biased
Josephson junction to inject QPs into the circuit. Upon the injection of QPs,
we show that we can trap and clear QPs when the SQUID is flux-biased. We
examine effects of the microwave loss associated with bulk QP transport in the
resonator, QP-related dissipation in the junction, and QP poisoning events. By
monitoring the QP trapping and clearing in time, we study the dynamics of these
processes and find a time-scale of few microseconds that is consistent with
electron-phonon relaxation in our system and correlated QP trapping and
clearing mechanisms. Our results highlight the QP trapping and clearing
dynamics as well as the associated time-scales in high transparency Josephson
junctions based fabricated on Al-InAs heterostructures.

Direct experimental detection of anyonic exchange statistics in fractional
quantum Hall systems by braiding the excitations and measuring the
wave-function phase is an enormous challenge. Here, we use a small, noisy
quantum computer to emulate direct braiding within the framework of a
simplified model applicable to a thin cylinder geometry and measure the
topological phase. Our algorithm first prepares the ground state with two
quasiholes. It then applies a unitary operation controlled by an ancilla,
corresponding to a sequence of adiabatic evolutions that takes one quasihole
around the other. We finally extract the phase of the wave function from
measuring the ancilla with a compound error mitigation strategy. Our results
open a new avenue for studying braiding statistics in fractional Hall states.
