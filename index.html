<h3>Insight into the melt processed Polylimonene oxide/Polylactic acid  blends</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08590" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08590</a>

<i>Miguel Palenzuel, Juan F. Vega, Virginia Souza-Egipsy, Javier Ramos, Christian Rentero, Sessini Valentina, Marta E. G. Mosquera</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, the polymerization of limonene oxide (LO) has been optimized at
room temperature with two different aluminium-based catalysts
[AlMeX{2,6-(CHPh$_2$)$_2$-4-tBu-C$_6$H$_2$O}] (X = Me (1), Cl (2)). A fully
bio-based ether, polylimonene oxide (PLO), has been synthesized with low
molecular weight and good thermal stability, being a potential sustainable
polymeric additive for other bio-based and biodegradable polymers such as
polylactic acid (PLA). Hence, we have explored its ability to influence the
thermal, mechanical and morphological properties of PLA by preparing their
blends by melt processing. The addition of a low amount of PLO led to a nearly
10 $^\circ$C decrease in the PLA glass transition temperature. Moreover, a
decrease in the PLA melting temperature and the degree of crystallinity was
observed. Interestingly, a remarkable increase in the flexibility of PLA-based
films was noticed. All the results point to the existence of strong
interactions between the components, suggesting their partial miscibility.

<h3>Spin-orbit coupling and Jahn-Teller effect in $T_d$ symmetry: an  \textit{ab initio} study on the substitutional nickel defect in diamond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08591" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08591</a>

<br>
<br>
We analyze the spin-orbit and Jahn-Teller interactions in $T_d$ symmetry that
are relevant for substitutional transition metal defects in semiconductors. We
apply our theory to the substitutional nickel defect in diamond and compute the
appropriate fine-leve structure and magneto-optical parameters by means of
hybrid density functional theory. Our calculations confirm the intepretations
of previous experimental findings that the 2.56-eV and 2.51-eV optical centres
are associated with this defect. Our analysis of the electronic structure
unravels possible mechanisms behind the observed optical transitions and the
optically detected magnetic resonance signal, too.

<h3>Exploring Thermal Transport in Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems  Utilizing Two-Dimensional Materials: Prospects and Hurdles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08592" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08592</a>

Two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures have enormous
applications in Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems (EESS) such as
batteries. A comprehensive and solid understanding of these materials' thermal
transport and mechanism is essential for the practical design of EESS.
Experiments have challenges in providing improved control and characterization
of complex structures, especially for low dimensional materials. Theoretical
and simulation tools such as first-principles calculations, boltzmann transport
equations, molecular dynamics simulations, lattice dynamics simulation, and
non-equilibrium Green's function provide reliable predictions of thermal
conductivity and physical insights to understand the underlying thermal
transport mechanism in materials. However, doing these calculations require
high computational resources. The development of new materials synthesis
technology and fast-growing demand for rapid and accurate prediction of
physical properties require novel computational approaches. The machine
learning (ML) method provides a promising solution to address such needs. This
review details the recent development in atomistic/molecular studies and ML of
thermal transport in EESS. The paper also addresses the latest significant
experimental advances. However, designing the best low-dimensional
materials-based heterostructures is like a multivariate optimization problem.
For example, a particular heterostructure may be suitable for thermal transport
but can have lower mechanical strength/stability. For bi/multilayer structures,
the interlayer distance may influence the thermal transport properties and
interlayer strength. Therefore, the last part addresses the future research
direction in low-dimensional materials-based heterostructure design for thermal
transport in EESS.

<h3>Data-driven methods for diffusivity prediction in nuclear fuels</h3>

The growth rate of structural defects in nuclear fuels under irradiation is
intrinsically related to the diffusion rates of the defects in the fuel
lattice. The generation and growth of atomistic structural defects can
significantly alter the performance characteristics of the fuel. This
alteration of functionality must be accurately captured to qualify a nuclear
fuel for use in reactors. Predicting the diffusion coefficients of defects and
how they impact macroscale properties such as swelling, gas release, and creep
is therefore of significant importance in both the design of new nuclear fuels
and the assessment of current fuel types. In this article, we apply data-driven
methods focusing on machine learning (ML) to determine various diffusion
properties of two nuclear fuels, uranium oxide and uranium nitride. We show
that using ML can increase, often significantly, the accuracy of predicting
diffusivity in nuclear fuels in comparison to current analytical models. We
also illustrate how ML can be used to quickly develop fuel models with
parameter dependencies that are more complex and robust than what is currently
available in the literature. These results suggest there is potential for ML to
accelerate the design, qualification, and implementation of nuclear fuels.

<h3>Investigation into the nature behind the interesting half levitation  behavior of claimed superconductor LK-99</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08594" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08594</a>
<br>
<i>Lingyi Liao, Zihao Chen, Yuanyuan Tan, Qingsong Mei</i>
<br>
<br>
A recent article published by Lee et.al. claimed to have successfully
achieved superconductivity at room temperature (RT) has become a topical issue.
Besides the research paper, Lee and his team provided a demonstration video of
LK-99 half levitating (HL) on a magnet. Such interesting HL appearance has
drawn tremendous sensation both in academia and the network. However, the true
identity of LK-99 still remains unclear, i.e., whether the HL behavior can
necessarily indicate the diamagnetism behavior of the sample. Here, we
fabricated our own LK-99 samples following the procedures reported by Lee et
al. We found quite a few sample pieces showing the typical HL that is similar
to those reported. Meanwhile, oxidation during the sample preparation was found
to deleterious to acquiring HL in the sample, while furnace cooling or water
quenching in the last step revealed little effect. However, our careful
observations indicated that those HL pieces are more likely simple
ferromagnetic. Then we conducted a comprehensive study on the behavior patterns
of typical diamagnetism and ferromagnetic substances interacting with a
Nd2Fe14B magnet, and provided instructions to distinguish the characteristics
between ferromagnetic and diamagnetic to prevent misunderstanding of LK-99 like
levitation behavior.

Solid state theory, density functional theory and its generalizations for
correlated systems together with numerical simulations on supercomputers allow
nowadays to model magnetic systems realistically and in detail and can be even
used to predict new materials, paving the way for more rapid material
development for applications in energy storage and conversion, information
technologies, sensors, actuators etc. Modelling magnets on different length
scales (between a few \r{A}ngstr\"om and several micrometers) requires,
however, approaches with very different mathematical formulations. Parameters
defining the material in each formulation can be determined either by fitting
experimental data or from theoretical calculations and there exists a
well-established approach for obtaining model parameters for each length scale
using the information from the smaller length scale. In this review, this
approach will be explained step-by-step in textbook style with examples of
successful multiscale modelling of different classes of magnetic materials from
the research literature as well as based on results newly obtained for this
review.

<h3>Probe particles in odd active viscoelastic fluids: how activity and  dissipation determine linear stability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08640" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08640</a>

<br>
<br>
Odd viscoelastic materials are constrained by fewer symmetries than their
even counterparts. The breaking of these symmetries allow these materials to
exhibit different features, which have attracted considerable attention in
recent years. Immersing a bead in such complex fluids allows for probing their
physical properties, highlighting signatures of their oddity and exploring
consequences of these broken symmetries. We present the conditions under which
the activity of an odd viscoelastic fluid can give rise to linear instabilities
in the motion of the probe particle and unveil how the features of the probe
particle dynamics depend on the oddity and activity of the viscoelastic medium
in which it is immersed.

<h3>New mechanisms to engineer magnetic skyrmions and topological  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08642</a>
<br>
<i>Panagiotis Kotetes, Yun-Peng Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an alternative route to stabilize magnetic skyrmions which does
not require Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interactions, magnetic anisotropy, or an
external Zeeman field. Our so-called magnetic skyrmion catalysis (MSC) solely
relies on the emergence of flux in the system's ground state. We review
scenarios that allow for a nonzero flux and summarize the magnetic skyrmion
phases that it induces. Among these, we focus on the so-called skyrmionic
spin-whirl crystal (Sk-SWC$_4$) phase. We discuss aspects of MSC using a
concrete model for topological superconductivity, which describes the surface
states of a topological crystalline insulator in the presence of proximity
induced pairing. By assuming that the surface states can exhibit the Sk-SWC$_4$
phase, we detail how the addition of a pairing gap generates a chiral
superconductor. For this purpose, we construct a low-energy model which renders
the mechanism for topological superconductivity transparent. Moreover, by
employing this model, we perform a self-consistent investigation of the
appearance of the Sk-SWC$_4$ phase for different values of the pairing gap and
the ground state's flux. Our analysis verifies the catalytic nature of our
mechanism in stabilizing the Sk-SWC$_4$ phase, since the magnetization modulus
becomes enhanced upon ramping up the flux. The involvement of MSC further
shields magnetism against the suppression induced by the pairing gap.
Remarkably, even if the pairing gap fully suppresses the Sk-SWC$_4$ phase for a
given value of flux, this skyrmion phase can be restored by further increasing
the flux. Our findings demonstrate that MSC enables topological
superconductivity in a minimal and robust fashion.

<h3>Scalable, ab initio protocol for quantum simulating SU($N$)$\times$U(1)  Lattice Gauge Theories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08643</a>
<br>
<i>Federica Maria Surace, Pierre Fromholz, Francesco Scazza, Marcello Dalmonte</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a protocol for the scalable quantum simulation of
SU($N$)$\times$U(1) lattice gauge theories with alkaline-earth like atoms in
optical lattices in both one- and two-dimensional systems. The protocol
exploits the combination of naturally occurring SU($N$) pseudo-spin symmetry
and strong inter-orbital interactions that is unique to such atomic species. A
detailed ab initio study of the microscopic dynamics shows how gauge invariance
emerges in an accessible parameter regime, and allows us to identify the main
challenges in the simulation of such theories. We provide quantitative results
about the requirements in terms of experimental stability in relation to
observing gauge invariant dynamics, a key element for a deeper analysis on the
functioning of such class of theories in both quantum simulators and computers.

<h3>Localization of vibrational modes in high-entropy oxides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08668" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08668</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The recently-discovered high-entropy oxides offer a paradoxical combination
of crystalline arrangement and high disorder. They differ qualitatively from
established paradigms for disordered solids such as glasses and alloys. In
these latter systems, it is well known that disorder induces localized
vibrational excitations. In this article, we explore the possibility of
disorder-induced localization in (MgCoCuNiZn)O, the prototypical high-entropy
oxide with rock-salt structure. To describe phononic excitations, we model the
interatomic potentials for the cation-oxygen interactions by fitting to the
physical properties of the parent binary oxides. We validate our model against
the experimentally determined crystal structure, bond lengths, and optical
conductivity. The resulting phonon spectrum shows wave-like propagating modes
at low energies and localized modes at high energies. Localization is reflected
in signatures such as participation ratio and correlation amplitude. Finally,
we explore the possibility of increased mass disorder in the oxygen sublattice.
Admixing sulphur or tellurium atoms with oxygen enhances localization. It even
leads to localized modes in the middle of the spectrum. Our results suggest
that high-entropy oxides are a promising platform to study Anderson
localization of phonons.

<h3>Electrical noise spectroscopy of magnons in a quantum Hall ferromagnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
Collective spin-wave excitations-magnons-in a quantum Hall ferromagnet are
promising quasi-particles for next-generation spintronics devices, including
platforms for information transfer. Detection of these charge-neutral
excitations relies on the conversion of magnons into electrical signals in the
form of excess electrons and holes, but if these signals are equal the magnon
detection remains elusive. In this work, we overcome this shortcoming by
measuring the electrical noise generated by magnons. We use the symmetry-broken
quantum Hall ferromagnet of the zeroth Landau level in graphene to launch
magnons. Absorption of these magnons creates excess noise above the Zeeman
energy and remains finite even when the average electrical signal is zero.
Moreover, we formulate a theoretical model in which the noise is generated by
equilibration (partial or full, depending on the bias voltage) between edge
channels and propagating magnons. Our model, which agrees with experimental
observations, also allows us to pinpoint the regime of ballistic magnon
transport in our device.

<br>
<br>
Feshbach resonances play a vital role in the success of cold atoms
investigating strongly-correlated physics. The recent observation of their
solid-state analog in the scattering of holes and intralayer excitons in
transition metal dichalcogenides [Schwartz et al., Science 374, 336 (2021)]
holds compelling promise for bringing fully controllable interactions to the
field of semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate how tunneling-induced layer
hybridization can lead to the emergence of two distinct classes of Feshbach
resonances in atomically thin semiconductors. Based on microscopic scattering
theory we show that these two types of Feshbach resonances allow to tune
interactions between electrons and both short-lived intralayer, as well as
long-lived interlayer excitons. We predict the exciton-electron scattering
phase shift from first principles and show that the exciton-electron coupling
is fully tunable from strong to vanishing interactions. The tunability of
interactions opens the avenue to explore Bose-Fermi mixtures in solid-state
systems in regimes that were previously only accessible in cold atom
experiments.

<h3>Comment on pressure driven flow of superfluid $^4$He through a nanopipe  (Botimer and Taborek 2016)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08736" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08736</a>

<i>Phil Attard</i>
<br>
<br>
Botimer and Taborek (2016) measured the mass flux of superfluid $^4$He
through a capillary into an evacuated chamber for various temperatures and
pressures of the reservoir chamber. They found a sharp transition from low flux
at low pressures to high flux at large pressures. Here it is shown that the
superfluid condition of chemical potential equality predicts the induced
temperature and also the transition pressure, which is attributed to the
transition from a semispherical cap to a pool of $^4$He at the exit of the
capillary. The results show that the two-fluid equations of superfluid flow,
Landau's phonon-roton theory, and Feynman's critical vortex theory are
unnecessary for a quantitative account of the measured transition pressure.

<h3>Modeling Fission Gas Release at the Mesoscale using Multiscale DenseNet  Regression with Attention Mechanism and Inception Blocks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08767</a>
<br>
<i>Peter Toma, Md Ali Muntaha, Joel B. Harley, Michael R. Tonks</i>
<br>
<br>
Mesoscale simulations of fission gas release (FGR) in nuclear fuel provide a
powerful tool for understanding how microstructure evolution impacts FGR, but
they are computationally intensive. In this study, we present an alternate,
data-driven approach, using deep learning to predict instantaneous FGR flux
from 2D nuclear fuel microstructure images. Four convolutional neural network
(CNN) architectures with multiscale regression are trained and evaluated on
simulated FGR data generated using a hybrid phase field/cluster dynamics model.
All four networks show high predictive power, with $R^{2}$ values above 98%.
The best performing network combine a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM) and InceptionNet mechanisms to provide superior accuracy (mean absolute
percentage error of 4.4%), training stability, and robustness on very low
instantaneous FGR flux values.

<h3>Unified framework of the microscopic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation  and its application to Skyrmion dynamics</h3>

<i>Fuming Xu, Gaoyang Li, Jian Chen, Zhizhou Yu, Lei Zhang, Baigeng Wang, Jian Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation is widely used to describe
magnetization dynamics. We develop a unified framework of the microscopic LLG
equation based on the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We present a
unified treatment for expressing the microscopic LLG equation in several
limiting cases, including the adiabatic, inertial, and nonadiabatic limits with
respect to the precession frequency for a magnetization with fixed magnitude,
as well as the spatial adiabatic limit for the magnetization with slow
variation in both its magnitude and direction. The coefficients of those terms
in the microscopic LLG equation are explicitly expressed in terms of
nonequilibrium Green's functions. As a concrete example, this microscopic
theory is applied to simulate the dynamics of a magnetic Skyrmion driven by
quantum parametric pumping. Our work provides a practical formalism of the
microscopic LLG equation for exploring magnetization dynamics.

One of the proposed ground states of monolayer WTe$_2$, a two-dimensional
topological insulator, is an excitonic condensate. However, time-reversal
preserving and breaking solutions are competing at the mean-field level of
analysis, and it is unclear which condensate, if any, is realized in nature. In
this work we analyze the experimental signatures that allow to provide evidence
for the excitonic ground states and to distinguish between the two types of
condensates using scanning tunneling microscopy. We provide clear experimental
signatures in local mapping and quasiparticle interference patterns that
visualize the expected changes in local charge and spin density, and
characterize allowed backscattering processes in the presence of impurities and
disorder. Our results will thus help in the determination of the nature of the
WTe$_2$ ground state.

<h3>Floquet Non-Abelian Topological Insulator and Multifold Bulk-Edge  Correspondence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08819</a>

<br>
<br>
Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges are beyond the scope
of the paradigmatic tenfold way and have gained increasing attention recently.
Here we investigate topological insulators with multiple tangled gaps in
Floquet settings and identify uncharted Floquet non-Abelian topological
insulators without any static or Abelian analog. We demonstrate that the
bulk-edge correspondence is multifold and follows the multiplication rule of
the quaternion group $Q_8$. The same quaternion charge corresponds to several
distinct edge-state configurations that are fully determined by phase-band
singularities of the time evolution. In the anomalous non-Abelian phase, edge
states appear in all bandgaps despite trivial quaternion charge. Furthermore,
we uncover an exotic swap effect -- the emergence of interface modes with
swapped driving, which is a signature of the non-Abelian dynamics and absent in
Floquet Abelian systems. Our work, for the first time, presents Floquet
topological insulators characterized by non-Abelian charges and opens up
exciting possibilities for exploring the rich and uncharted territory of
non-equilibrium topological phases.

<h3>An unprecedented synergy of high-temperature tensile strength and  ductility in a NiCoCrAlTi high-entropy alloy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08850</a>

<i>Hongmin Zhang, Fanchao Meng, Haoyan Meng, Yang Tong, Peter K. Liaw, Xiao Yang, Lei Zhao, Haizhou Wang, Yanfei Gao, Shuying Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
The present work reported a novel L12-strengthening NiCoCrAlTi high entropy
alloy (HEA) with an outstanding synergy of tensile strength and ductility at
both ambient and high temperatures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
characterization revealed a high density of rod-like and spheroidal L12
precipitates distributing in the micro/nanograins and non-recrystallized
regions in the annealed specimens. The tremendously high yield stress, ultimate
tensile stress (UTS), and ductility of the HEA at 600 C were ~1060 MPa, 1271
MPa, and 25%, respectively, which were significantly superior to most reported
HEAs and Co- and Ni-based superalloys to date. Systematic TEM analysis unveiled
that the cooperation among L12 precipitation, extensive stacking faults (SFs),
deformation twins (DTs), immobile Lomer-Cottrell (L-C) locks formed from
interactions between SFs and SFs/DTs, hierarchical SFs/DTs networks, as well as
hetero-deformation-induced strengthening dominated the plastic deformation at
600 C. Such a unique deformation mechanism enabled extremely high tensile
strength and sustained ductility of the HEA at a high temperature.

<h3>Limitations of mean-field approximations in describing shift-current and  injection-current in materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08875" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08875</a>
<br>
<i>Shunsuke A. Sato, Angel Rubio</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate bulk photovoltaic effects, with a specific focus
on shift-current and injection-current. Initially, we perform a numerical
analysis of the direct current (dc) induced by a laser pulse with a
one-dimensional model, utilizing mean-field theories such as time-dependent
Hartree--Fock and time-dependent Hartree methods. Our numerical results,
obtained with mean-field theories, reveal that the dc component of the current
exists even after irradiation with linearly polarized light as a second-order
nonlinear effect, indicating the generation of injection current. Conversely,
when we employ the independent particle approximation, no injection current is
generated by linearly polarized light. To develop the microscopic understanding
of injection current within the mean-field approximation, we further analyze
the dc component of the current with the perturbation theory, employing the
mean-field approximations, the independent-particle approximation, and the
exact solution of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. The perturbation
analysis clarifies that the injection current induced by linearly polarized
light under the mean-field approximations is an artifact caused by population
imbalance, created through quantum interference from unphysical self-excitation
pathways. Therefore, investigation of many-body effects on the bulk
photovoltaic effects have to be carefully conducted in mean-field schemes due
to potential contamination by unphysical dc current. Additionally, we perform
the first-principles electron dynamics calculation for BaTiO$_3$ based on the
time-dependent density functional theory, and we confirm that the above
findings from the one-dimensional model calculation and the perturbation
analysis apply to realistic systems.

<h3>Multi-point distribution for Gaussian non-equilibrium non-Markovian  observables</h3>

<i>Roland R Netz</i>
<br>
<br>
When analyzing experimental or simulation time-series data, the question
arises whether it is possible to tell from a one-dimensional time-dependent
trajectory whether the system is in equilibrium or not. We here consider the
non-equilibrium version of the generalized Langevin equation for a Gaussian
observable and show that i) the multi-point joint distribution solely depends
on the two-point correlation function and that ii) the two-point correlation
function for a non-equilibrium process is identical to an equilibrium process
with uniquely determined parameters. Since the multi-point joint distribution
completely characterizes the dynamics of an observable, this means that the
non-equilibrium character of a system, in contrast to its non-Markovianity,
cannot be read off from a one-dimensional trajectory.

<h3>Controlling Umklapp scattering in bilayer graphene moir'e superlattice</h3>

<i>Mohit Kumar Jat, Shubhankar Mishra, Harsimran Kaur Mann, Robin Bajaj, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Manish Jain, Aveek Bid</i>
<br>
<br>
In this Letter, we present experimental findings on electron-electron
scattering in a two-dimensional moir'e heterostructure with tunable Fermi wave
vector, reciprocal lattice vector, and band gap. We achieve this in
high-mobility aligned heterostructures of bilayer graphene (BLG) and hBN.
Around half-filling, the primary contribution to the resistance of BLG/hBN
aligned superlattices arises from electron-electron Umklapp (Uee) scattering,
making the resistance of graphene/hBN moir'e devices significantly larger than
that of non-aligned devices (where Uee is forbidden). We quantify the strength
of the Uee scattering and find that it follows a universal scaling with Fermi
energy and has a non-monotonic dependence on the charge carrier density. The
Uee scattering is strongly electric field tunable and affected by
layer-polarization of BLG. It has a strong particle-hole asymmetry - the
resistance when the chemical potential is in the conduction band is
significantly lesser than when it is in the valence band, making the
electron-doped regime more practical for potential applications.

Tungsten diselenide, WSe2 shows excellent properties and become very
promising material among two dimensional semiconductors. Wide band gap and
large spin-orbit coupling along with naturally lacking inversion symmetry in
the monolayer WSe2 make it efficient material for spintronics, optoelectronics
and valleytronics applications. In this work, we report electrical transport
properties of monolayer WSe2 based field effect transistor with most needed
multilayer Co/Pt ferromagnetic electrodes exhibiting perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. We studied contacts behaviour by performing I-V curve measurements
and estimating Schottky barrier heights (SBHs). SBHs estimated from
experimental data are found to be comparatively small, without using any tunnel
barrier. This work expands the current understanding of WSe2 based devices and
gives insight into the electrical behaviour of Co/Pt metal contacts, which can
open great possibilities for spintronic/valleytronic applications.

<br>
We investigated the local magnetism of the organic conductor,
$\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$Hg(SCN)$_{2}$Cl, with a quasi-triangular lattice of weakly
dimerized molecules through $^{13}$C NMR spectroscopy. The NMR spectra and
nuclear relaxation show that charge disproportionation occurs, associated with
the metal-insulator transition at 31 K. The relaxation rate indicates that the
paramagnetic spins in the insulating phase undergo a transition into a
spin-singlet ground state with the emergence of orphan spins, a possible
valence-bond-glass state. The present results are in high contrast to the
spin-cluster paramagnetism of the electric dipole-liquid candidate,
$\kappa$--(ET)$_{2}$Hg(SCN)$_{2}$Br, having nearly identical material
parameters. This fact indicates that these two systems are on the verge between
distinct phases in both charge and spin degrees of freedom; a spin-singlet
charge-ordered state versus a spin-active Mott insulating state, competing with
each other on a triangular lattice of dimerized sites.

<h3>Nonlinear-Cost Random Walk: exact statistics of the distance covered for  fixed budget</h3>

We consider the Nonlinear-Cost Random Walk model in discrete time introduced
in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 237102 (2023)], where a fee is charged for each jump
of the walker. The nonlinear cost function is such that slow/short jumps incur
a flat fee, while for fast/long jumps the cost is proportional to the distance
covered. In this paper we compute analytically the average and variance of the
distance covered in $n$ steps when the total budget $C$ is fixed, as well as
the statistics of the number of long/short jumps in a trajectory of length $n$,
for the exponential jump distribution. These observables exhibit a very rich
and non-monotonic scaling behavior as a function of the variable $C/n$, which
is traced back to the makeup of a typical trajectory in terms of long/short
jumps, and the resulting "entropy" thereof. As a byproduct, we compute the
asymptotic behavior of ratios of Kummer hypergeometric functions when both the
first and last arguments are large. All our analytical results are corroborated
by numerical simulations.

<h3>Mutual information and correlations across topological phase transitions  in topologically ordered graphene zigzag nanoribbons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08970</a>
<br>
<i>In Hwan Lee, Hoang Anh Le, S.-R. Eric Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
Graphene zigzag nanoribbons, initially in a topologically ordered state,
undergo a topological phase transition into crossover phases distinguished by
quasi-topological order. We computed mutual information for both the
topologically ordered phase and its crossover phases, revealing the following
results: (i) In the topologically ordered phase, A-chirality carbon lines
strongly entangle with B-chirality carbon lines on the opposite side of the
zigzag ribbon. This entanglement persists but weakens in crossover phases. (ii)
The upper zigzag edge entangles with non-edge lines of different chirality on
the opposite side of the ribbon. (iii) Entanglement increases as more carbon
lines are grouped together, regardless of the lines' chirality. No long-range
entanglement was found in the symmetry protected phase in the absence of
disorder.

Understanding how chiral active particles -- which self-propel and
self-rotate -- interact with each other is crucial to uncover how chiral active
matter self-organizes into dynamic structures and patterns. Long-range
fluctuation-induced (FI) forces in nonequilibrium steady states of active
matter systems can be considerably strong and govern structure formation in
interplay with other interactions. However, the impact of chirality on FI
forces is not understood to date. We study effective forces between intruders
immersed in chiral active fluids with tunable chirality and find that the
influence of chirality on the FI force nontrivially depends on the elongation
of active particles. By increasing the ratio between self-rotation and
self-propulsion, the FI force monotonically decreases for fully circular active
objects, as the active bath structure gradually changes from rotating flocks
and vortices to localized spinners. Contrarily, a nonmonotonic behavior is
observed upon increasing the chirality of rodlike active objects: There exists
an optimal chiral angle which maximizes the magnitude and range of the FI
interaction. We obtain the phase diagram of transition between attractive and
repulsive forces in the space of chirality, propulsion, and separation between
intruders. By measuring the collision statistics between active particles and
intruders at different chirality and separation, we establish a direct link
between the FI force and the average collision number and demonstrate how the
balance of collisions around the intruders varies with chirality and
separation. Our results provide new insights into an interplay between
activity, chirality, and self assembly.

In this study, we carried out an investigation of the EuCoA$_2$As$_2$
compound, focusing on its various physical properties. Our analysis covered the
structural, magnetic, electronic, optical, thermodynamic and thermoelectric
characteristics of this compound. To carry out this study, we used density
functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Wien2k software package. To
determine the exchange-correlation potential, we used the GGA-PBE (Perdew,
Burke and Ernzerhof) approach, taking spin-orbit coupling (SOC) into account.
Our results indicate that the EuCoA$_2$As$_2$ compound exhibits metallic
behavior. In addition, we have determined that the compound's stable ground
state is the ferromagnetic (FM) phase. We have also calculated the Debye
temperature and the Gr\"uneisen parameter. In addition, we evaluated various
optical properties, including electron energy loss, absorption coefficient,
real and imaginary dielectric tensors, and real and imaginary optical
conductivity. We found that the compound has excellent absorption
characteristics in the low and mid ultraviolet (UV) spectra. In addition, we
investigated the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electronic
conductivity and thermal conductivity of the lattice. The results revealed that
the compound exhibits n-type behavior, with negative values for the Seebeck
coefficient. These results are analyzed in detail and provide valuable
information on the properties of the EuCoA$_2$As$_2$ compound. Additionally,
the computed parameters were compared to those found in the literature. A good
deals have been revealed with the existing results.

<h3>Fluctuation-dissipation relation for non-Hermitian Langevin dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09018</a>
<br>
<i>Yan V. Fyodorov, Ewa Gudowska-Nowak, Maciej A. Nowak, Wojciech Tarnowski</i>
<br>
<br>
In systems perturbed by external fields, both constant and time dependent,
the linear response of measurable observables is analyzed by the use of
celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) which allows one to link the
response function to time dependent correlations of observables measured in the
reference unperturbed state. This central result in equilibrium statistical
mechanics allows one to relate measurable macroscopic quantities, like specific
heats or susceptibilities to correlations of fluctuations. In this letter we
extend the standard FDT to the case when multidimensional matrix representing
transition probabilities is strictly non-hermitian. This feature dramatically
modifies the dynamics, by incorporating the effect of eigenvectors. We suggest,
that this modification has an impact on the studies of collective phenomena in
neural matrix models, leading, via transient behavior, to such phenomena as
synchronisation and emergence of the memory.

We investigate the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency for several

demonstrate the dissipative self-consistent DFT-NEGF simulations of realistic

(up to 1000 atoms) and up to several 100,000 atoms in the full device, pushing
the limit of ab-initio transport.

<h3>Robust correlated magnetic moments in end-modified graphene nanoribbons</h3>

<br>
<i>Antoine Honet, Luc Henrard, Vincent Meunier</i>
<br>
<br>
We conduct a theoretical examination of the electronic and magnetic
characteristics of end-modified 7-atom wide armchair graphene nanoribbons
(AGNRs). Our investigation is performed within the framework of a single-band
Hubbard model, beyond a mean-field approximation. First, we carry out a
comprehensive comparison of various approaches for accommodating
di-hydrogenation configurations at the AGNR ends. We demonstrate that the
application of an on-site potential to the modified carbon atom, coupled with
the addition of an electron, replicates phenomena such as the experimentally
observed reduction in the bulk-states (BS) gap. These results for the density
of states (DOS) and electronic densities align closely with those obtained
through a method explicitly designed to account for the orbital properties of
hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, our study enables a clear differentiation between
mean-field (MF) magnetic moments, which are spatially confined to the same
sites as the topological end-states (ES), and correlation-induced magnetic
moments, which exhibit localization along all edges of the AGNRs. Notably, we
find the robustness of these correlation-induced magnetic moments relative to
end modifications, within the scope of the method we employ.

<br>
<br>
The distortion of corner-sharing octahedra in isovalent perovskite
transition-metal oxide interfaces is proven to be an excellent way to tailor
the electronic and magnetic properties of their heterostructures. Combining
depth-dependent magnetic characterization technique; (polarized neutron
reflectivity, PNR); and theoretical calculation (density functional theory), we
report interface-driven magnetic exchange interactions due to a modification in
the octahedral rotations at the interfaces in an isovalent La0.67Ca0.33MnO3
(LCMO)/La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) heterostructures. PNR results determined a
length scale of ~ 8 unit cells at the interface, which demonstrated a
modification in magnetic properties. The results also predicted a
low-temperature exchange bias for these ferromagnetic heterostructures with a
maximum exchange bias for the heterostructure, which showed an enhanced
antiferromagnetic coupling at the interfaces.

<h3>High temperature ferrimagnetic semiconductors by spin-dependent doping  in high temperature antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09061</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Wen Li, Gang Su, Bo Gu</i>
<br>
<br>
To realize room temperature ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors is still a
challenge in spintronics. Many antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators and
semiconductors with high Neel temperature $T_N$ are obtained in experiments,
such as LaFeO$_3$, BiFeO$_3$, etc. High concentrations of magnetic impurities
can be doped into these AFM materials, but AFM state with very tiny net
magnetic moments was obtained in experiments, because the magnetic impurities
were equally doped into the spin up and down sublattices of the AFM materials.
Here, we propose that the effective magnetic field provided by a FM substrate
could guarantee the spin-dependent doping in AFM materials, where the doped
magnetic impurities prefer one sublattice of spins, and the ferrimagnetic (FIM)
materials are obtained. To demonstrate this proposal, we study the Mn-doped AFM
insulator LaFeO$_3$ with FM substrate of Fe metal by the density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. It is shown that the doped magnetic Mn impurities
prefer to occupy one sublattice of AFM insulator, and introduce large magnetic
moments in La(Fe,Mn)O$_3$. For the AFM insulator LaFeO$_3$ with high $T_N$ =
740 K, several FIM semiconductors with high Curie temperature $T_C >$ 300 K and
the band gap less than 2 eV are obtained by DFT calculations, when 1/8 or 1/4
Fe atoms in LaFeO$_3$ are replaced by the other 3d, 4d transition metal
elements. The large magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is obtained in these
LaFeO$_3$-based FIM semiconductors. In addition, the FIM semiconductors with
high $T_C$ are also obtained by spin-dependent doping in some other AFM
materials with high $T_N$, including BiFeO$_3$, SrTcO$_3$, CaTcO$_3$, etc. Our
theoretical results propose a way to obtain high $T_C$ FIM semiconductors by
spin-dependent doping in high $T_N$ AFM insulators and semiconductors.

<h3>Mechanisms of temperature-dependent thermal transport in amorphous  silica from machine-learning molecular dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09062" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09062</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Amorphous silica (a-SiO$_2$) is a foundational disordered material for which
the thermal transport properties are important for various applications. To
accurately model the interatomic interactions in classical molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of thermal transport in a-SiO$_2$, we herein develop an
accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned potential model that allowed us
to generate a-SiO$_2$ samples closely resembling experimentally produced ones.
Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method and a proper quantum-statistical
correction to the classical MD results, quantitative agreement with experiments
is achieved for the thermal conductivities of bulk and 190 nm-thick a-SiO$_2$
films over a wide range of temperatures. To interrogate the thermal vibrations
at different temperatures, we calculated the current correlation functions
corresponding to the transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA)
collective vibrations. The results reveal that below the Ioffe-Regel crossover
frequency, phonons as well-defined excitations, remain applicable in a-SiO$_2$
and play a predominant role at low temperatures, resulting in a
temperature-dependent increase in thermal conductivity. In the high-temperature
region, more phonons are excited, accompanied by a more intense liquid-like
diffusion event. We attribute the temperature-independent thermal conductivity
in the high-temperature range of a-SiO$_2$ to the collaborative involvement of
excited phonon scattering and liquid-like diffusion in heat conduction. These
findings provide physical insights into the thermal transport of a-SiO$_2$ and
are expected to be applied to a vast range of amorphous materials.

<h3>Coherence length and penetration depth in strongly correlated  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09063" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09063</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic
condensate characterized by two intrinsic length scales: the coherence length
$\xi_0$ and the London penetration depth $\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$. While their
description is well established in weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) theory and Eliashberg theory, $\xi_0$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$ are
generally unknown quantities in strongly correlated superconductors. In this
work, we establish a framework to calculate these length scales in microscopic
theories and from first principles. Central to this idea are Nambu-Gor'kov
Green functions under a constraint of finite-momentum pairing and their
analysis with respect to the superconducting order parameter and resultant
supercurrents. We illustrate with a multi-orbital model of alkali-doped
fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$) using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) how
proximity of superconductivity, Jahn-Teller metallic, and Mott-localized states
impact superconducting coherence, order parameter stiffness, and critical
temperature. Our analysis reveals a "localized" superconducting regime with
robustly short $\xi_0$. Multi-orbital effects cause a domeless rise in the
critical temperature as the pairing interaction is increased, setting this
system apart from the BCS to Bose-Einstein-Condensate (BEC) crossover
phenomenology.

<h3>Magnon spin capacitor</h3>

<br>
<i>Pieter M. Gunnink, Tim Ludwig, Rembert A. Duine</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we show that a magnon spin capacitor is realized at a junction
between two exchange coupled ferromagnets. In this junction, the buildup of
magnon spin over the junction is coupled to the difference in magnon chemical
potential, realizing the magnon spin analogue of an electrical capacitor. We
analyse the junction in detail by considering spin injection and detection from
normal metal leads, the tunnelling current across the junction and magnon decay
within the ferromagnet, showing that such a structure realizes a magnon spin RC
circuit. Choosing platinum and yttrium iron garnet as the normal metal and
ferromagnet, we numerically calculate the RC time, which ranges from
picoseconds to microseconds, depending on the area of the junction. We
therefore conclude that the magnon spin capacitor has clear experimental
signatures and could directly be of use in applications.

Randomly coupled phase oscillators may synchronize into disordered patterns
of collective motion. We analyze this transition in a large, fully connected
Kuramoto model with symmetric but otherwise independent random interactions.
Using the dynamical cavity method we reduce the dynamics to a stochastic single

we study analytically and numerically. We clarify the nature of the volcano
transition and elucidate its relation to the existence of an oscillator glass
phase.

<i>L. R√©gnier, M. Dolgushev, O. B√©nichou</i>
<br>
<br>
Very recently, a fundamental observable has been introduced and analyzed to
quantify the exploration of random walks: the time $\tau_k$ required for a
random walk to find a site that it never visited previously, when the walk has
already visited $k$ distinct sites. Here, we tackle the natural issue of the
statistics of $M_n$, the longest duration out of $\tau_0,\dots,\tau_{n-1}$.
This problem belongs to the active field of extreme value statistics, with the
difficulty that the random variables $\tau_k$ are both correlated and
non-identically distributed. Beyond this fundamental aspect, we show that the
asymptotic determination of the statistics of $M_n$ finds explicit applications
in foraging theory and allows us to solve the open $d$-dimensional starving
random walk problem, in which each site of a lattice initially contains one
food unit, consumed upon visit by the random walker, which can travel
$\mathcal{S}$ steps without food before starving. Processes of diverse nature,
including regular diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and diffusion in disordered
media and fractals, share common properties within the same universality
classes.

<h3>Enhancing the excitation gap of a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain</h3>

Connecting double quantum dots via a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid
segment offers a platform for creating a two-site Kitaev chain that hosts a
pair of "poor man's Majoranas" at a finely tuned sweet spot. However, the
effective couplings, which are mediated by Andreev bound states in the hybrid,
are generally weak in the tunneling regime. As a consequence, the excitation
gap is limited in size, presenting a formidable challenge for using this
platform to demonstrate non-Abelian statistics of Majoranas and realizing
error-resilient topological quantum computing. In this work, we systematically
study the effects of increasing the coupling between the dot and the hybrid
segment. In particular, the proximity effect transforms the dot orbitals into
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, forming a new spinless fermion basis for a Kitaev
chain, and we derive a theory for their effective coupling. As the coupling
strength between the dots and the hybrid segment increases, we find a
significant enhancement of the excitation gap and reduced sensitivity to local
perturbations. Although the hybridization of the Majorana wave function with
the central Andreev bound states increases strongly with increasing coupling,
the overlap of Majorana modes on the outer dots remains small, which is a
prerequisite for potential qubit experiments. We discuss how the
strong-coupling regime shows in experimentally accessible quantities, such as
the local and non-local conductance, and provide a protocol for tuning a
double-dot system into a sweet spot with a large excitation gap.

<h3>Optimizing site-specific specimen preparation for Atom Probe Tomography  by using hydrogen for visualizing radiation-induced damage</h3>

<br>
<br>
Atom probe tomography (APT) is extensively used to measure the local
chemistry of materials. Site-specific preparation via a focused ion beam (FIB)
is routinely implemented to fabricate needle-shaped specimens with an end
radius in the range of 50 nm. This preparation route is sometimes supplemented
by transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) to facilitate the positioning of a
region of interest sufficiently close to the apex. Irradiating the specimen
with energetic electrons and ions can lead to the generation of vacancies and
even amorphization of the specimen. These extrinsically created vacancies
become crucial for probing the hydrogen or deuterium distribution since they
act as a strong trap. Here, we investigated the feasibility of site-specific
preparation of a two-phase medium-Mn steel containing austenite (fcc) and
ferrite (bcc). Following gaseous charging of APT specimens in deuterium (D2),
clusters enriched by up to 35 at.% D, are imaged after Pt deposition,
conventional Ga-FIB preparation, and TKD conducted separately. These D-rich
clusters are assumed to arise from the agglomeration of vacancies acting as
strong traps. By systematically eliminating these preparation-induced damages,
we finally introduce a workflow allowing for studying intrinsic traps for H/D
inherent to the material.

<br>
<br>
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE) plays important role in the rapidly developing
field of antiferromagnetic spintronics. It has been recently discussed that it
can be a feature of not only uncompensated magnetic systems but also in
altermagnetic materials. Hexagonal MnTe belongs to this appealing group of
compounds exhibiting AHE and is commonly perceived as magnetically compensated.
Here, we demonstrate that bulk form of MnTe exhibits small but detectable
magnetic moment correlating with hysteretic behaviour of the AHE. We formulate
a phenomenological model which explains how this feature allows to create a
disbalance between states with opposite N\'eel vector and prevent the AHE
signal from averaging out to zero. Moreover, we show how the dependence of AHE
on the N\'eel vector arises on microscopical level and highlight the
differences in Berry curvature between magnetically compensated and
uncompensated systems.

<h3>An explicit evolution from N√©el to striped antiferromagnetic states in  the spin-1/2 $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
The frustrated spin-$1/2$ $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice
has been extensively studied since 1988 because of its close relationship to
the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and more importantly
involved novel phase of matter in its own right, namely, quantum spin liquid
(QSL), one of hot topics in condensed matter physics in recent years. However,
the phase diagram of the model, particularly in the maximally frustrated regime
$J_2/J_1 \sim 0.5$, is quite controversial, and more seriously the nature of
the QSL is not clear at all. Here we provide a pattern picture, on one hand, to
show explicitly how the system evolves from the N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM)
state at small $J_2$ to the striped AFM one at large $J_2$; on the other hand,
to uncover the nature of the QSL if it exists in the intermediate $J_2$
coupling regime. For simplicity, we show our results by taking the square
lattice $L=L_x \times L_y$ with size $L_x=L_y=4$ here and periodic boundary
condition is considered, and furthermore, exact diagonalization is employed to
confirm the correctness of our picture. Our results indicate that the highly
frustration regime is characterized by diagonal two-domain, while the N\'eel
AFM state has a diagonal single-domain and the striped AFM state shows itself
as a diagonal four-domain, namely, completely diagonal antiferromagnetic order,
in the present case. Increasing the system size, the number of the diagonal
domains increases correspondingly, but the diagonal single-domain for the
N\'eel AFM state and the diagonal $L_{x(y)}$-domain for the striped AFM state
remain unchanged. Our results shed light on the understanding of the QSL.

We theoretically investigate the double-resonance Raman spectrum of monolayer
graphene down to infrared laser excitation energies. By using first-principles
density functional theory calculations, we improve upon previous theoretical
predictions based on conical models or tight-binding approximations, and
rigorously justify the evaluation of the electron-phonon enhancement found in
Ref. [Venanzi, T., Graziotto, L. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 256901 (2023)].
We proceed to discuss the effects of such enhancement on the room temperature

Over the last decade, the possibility of realizing topological
superconductivity (TSC) has generated much excitement, mainly due to the
potential use of its excitations (Majorana zero modes) in a fault-tolerant
topological quantum computer 1,2. TSC can be created in electronic systems
where the topological and superconducting orders coexist3, motivating the
continued exploration of candidate material platforms to this end. Here, we use
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to synthesize heterostructures that host emergent
interfacial superconductivity when a non-superconducting antiferromagnet (FeTe)
is interfaced with a topological insulator (TI) (Bi, Sb)2Te3 wherein the
chemical potential can be tuned through varying the Bi/Sb ratio. By performing
in-vacuo angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and ex-situ
electrical transport measurements, we find that the superconducting transition
temperature and the upper critical magnetic field are suppressed when the
chemical potential approaches the Dirac point. This observation implies a
direct correlation between the interfacial superconductivity and Dirac
electrons of the TI layer. We provide evidence to show that the observed
interfacial superconductivity and its chemical potential dependence is the
result of the competition between the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type
ferromagnetic coupling mediated by Dirac surface states and antiferromagnetic
exchange couplings that generate the bicollinear antiferromagnetic order in the
FeTe layer. The Dirac-fermion-assisted interfacial superconductivity in
(Bi,Sb)2Te3/FeTe heterostructures provides a new approach to probe TSC and
Majorana physics in hybrid devices and potentially constitutes an alternative
platform for topological quantum computation.

A general free bosonic system with a pairing term is described by a bosonic
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian. The representation is given by a
pseudo-Hermitian matrix, which is crucially different from the Hermitian
representation of a fermionic BdG Hamiltonian. In fermionic BdG systems, a
topological invariant of the whole particle (hole) bands can be nontrivial,
which characterizes the Andreev bound states (ABS) including Majorana fermions.
In bosonic cases, on the other hand, the corresponding topological invariant is
thought to be trivial owing to the stability condition of the bosonic ground
state. In this Letter, we consider a two-dimensional model that realizes a
bosonic analogy of the ABS. The boundary states of this model are located
outside the bulk bands and are characterized by a nontrivial Berry phase (or
polarization) of the hole band. Furthermore, we investigate the zero-energy
flat-band limit in which the Bloch Hamiltonian is defective, where the particle
and hole states are identical to each other. In this limit, the Berry phase is
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantized thanks to an emergent parity-time symmetry. This is an
example of a topological invariant that uses the defective nature as a
projection structure. Thus, boundary states in our model are essentially
different from Hermitian topological modes and their variants.

Focal conic domains, are defects characteristic of layered liquid crystal
phases. Their association can built flowers where petals are the ellipses of
the Dupin cyclides involved in these defect. We report here the observation of
focal conic flowers in cholesteric droplets sessile on a glass surface and
surrounded by glycerol. The observation of the droplets in different directions
helps to solve the 3D architecture of the flower. The effects of the droplet
size and of the pitch value are also reported.

<br>
<br>
A method to simulate local properties and processes in crystals with
impurities via constructing cluster models within the frame of the
compound-tunable embedding potential (CTEP) and highly-accurate {\it ab initio}
relativistic molecular-type electronic structure calculations is developed and
applied to the Ce and Th-doped yttrium orthophosphate crystals, YPO$_4$, having
xenotime structure. Two embedded cluster models are considered, the "minimal"
one, YO$_8$@CTEP$_{\rm min}$, consisting of the central Y$^{3+}$ cation and its
first coordination sphere of eight O$^{2-}$ anions (i.~e.\ with broken P--O
bonds), and its extended counterpart, Y(PO$_4$)$_6$@CTEP$_{\rm ext}$, implying
the full treatment of all atoms of the PO$_4^{3-}$ anions nearest to the
central Y$^{3+}$ cation. CTEP$_{\rm min,ext}$ denote here the corresponding
cluster environment described within the CTEP method. The relativistic
Fock-space coupled cluster (FS RCC) theory is applied to the minimal cluster
model to study electronic excitations localized on Ce$^{3+}$ and Th$^{3+}$
impurity ions. Calculated transition energies for the cerium-doped xenotime are
in a good agreement with the available experimental data (mean absolute
deviation of ca.0.3 eV for $4f{\to}5d$ type transitions). For the thorium-doped
crystal the picture of electronic states is predicted to be quite complicated,
the ground state is expected to be of the $6d$ character. The uncertainty for
the excitation energies of thorium-doped xenotime is estimated to be within
0.35 eV. Radiative lifetimes of excited states are calculated at the FS RCC
level for both doped crystals. The calculated lifetime of the lowest $5d$ state
of Ce$^{3+}$ differs from the experimentally measured one by no more than
twice.

There has been extensive activity exploring the doping of semiconducting
two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides in order to tune their
electronic and magnetic properties. The outcome of doping depends on various
factors, including the intrinsic properties of the host material, the nature of
the dopants used, their spatial distribution as well as their interactions with
other types of defects. A thorough atomic-level analysis is essential to fully
understand these mechanisms. In this work, vanadium doped WSe$_2$ monolayer
grown by molecular beam epitaxy is investigated using four-dimensional scanning
transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). Through center of mass-based
reconstruction, atomic scale maps are produced, allowing the visualization of
both the electric field and the electrostatic potential around individual V
atoms. To provide quantitative insights, these results are successfully
compared with multislice image simulations based on ab initio calculations,
accounting for lens aberrations. Finally, a negative charge around the V
dopants is detected as a drop in the electrostatic potential, unambiguously
demonstrating that 4D-STEM can be used to detect and to accurately analyze
single dopant charge states in semiconducting 2D materials.

<h3>Chiral Majorana hinge modes on a curved surface with magnetic impurities</h3>

Chiral Majorana one-dimensional modes have been proposed as they key
component for topological quantum computing. In this study, we explore their
potential realization as hinge modes in higher-order topological
superconductors. To create such phases, we engineer a sign-changing,
time-reversal symmetry-breaking mass term through an ensemble of magnetic
impurities on the surface of a sphere. The magnetization of this ensemble
arises from the competition between the external magnetic field and the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction among the impurities, mediated
by the surface Majorana modes. We determine the magnetic phase diagram and
identify the optimal magnetic field to minimize orbital effects and induce a
sign changing mass term. This term opens a gap in the surface spectrum,
resulting in a gapless one-dimensional chiral Majorana mode along the nodal
line of the mass term, thereby implementing a second-order topological
superconductor.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the magnetic properties of the monoclinic D-type
$\rm{Er_2Si_2O_7}$ with a distorted honeycomb lattice using powder and single
crystal neutron scattering techniques, as well as single crystal magnetisation
measurements. The powder neutron diffraction shows that below the ordering
temperature, $T_{\rm N}=1.85$ K, the compound forms a ${\bf q}=0$
antiferromagnetic structure with four sublattices. For $H \! \parallel \! a$,
magnetisation measurements reveal a narrow, but clearly visible plateau at one
third of the magnetisation saturation value. The plateau's stabilisation is
accompanied by a significant increase of the magnetic unit cell, as the
magnetic peaks with fractional indices are observed in single crystal neutron
diffraction experiments. At low-temperatures, the inelastic neutron scattering
measurements reveal the presence of low-energy dispersionless excitations.
Their spectrum is sensitive to the applied field, it significantly softens on
the magnetisation plateau, and demonstrates the behaviour expected for a
non-collinear Ising antiferromagnet away from the plateau.

<h3>Driven transport of active particles through arrays of symmetric  obstacles</h3>

We numerically examine the driven transport of an overdamped self-propelled
particle through a two-dimensional array of circular obstacles. A detailed
analysis of transport quantifiers (mobility and diffusivity) has been performed
for two types of channels, {\it channel I} and {\it channel II}, that
respectively correspond to the parallel and diagonal drives with respect to the
array axis. Our simulation results show that the signatures of pinning actions
and depinning processes in the array of obstacles are manifested through excess
diffusion peaks or sudden drops in diffusivity, and abrupt jumps in mobility
with varying amplitude of the drive. The underlying depinning mechanisms and
the associated threshold driving strength largely depend on the persistent
length of self-propulsion. For low driving strength, both diffusivity and
mobility are noticeably suppressed by the array of obstacles, irrespective of
the self-propulsion parameters and direction of the drive. When self-propulsion
length is larger than a channel compartment size, transport quantifiers are
insensitive to the rotational relaxation time. Transport with diagonal drives
features self-propulsion-dependent negative differential mobility. The
amplitude of the negative differential mobility of an active particle is much
larger than that of a passive one. The present analysis aims at understanding
the driven transport of active species like, bacteria, virus, Janus Particle
etc. in porous medium.

Lensless coherent x-ray imaging techniques have great potential for
high-resolution imaging of magnetic systems with a variety of in-situ
perturbations. Despite many investigations of ferromagnets, extending these
techniques to the study of other magnetic materials, primarily
antiferromagnets, is lacking. Here, we demonstrate the first (to our knowledge)
study of an antiferromagnet using holographic imaging through the "holography
with extended reference by autocorrelation linear differential operation"
technique. Energy-dependent contrast with both linearly and circularly
polarised x-rays are demonstrated. Antiferromagnetic domains and topological
textures are studied in the presence of applied magnetic fields, demonstrating
quasi-cyclic domain reconfiguration up to 500 mT.

<h3>Phonon thermal transport in UO$_2$ via self-consistent perturbation  theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
Computing thermal transport from first-principles in UO$_2$ is complicated
due to the challenges associated with Mott physics. Here we use irreducible
derivative approaches to compute the cubic and quartic phonon interactions in
UO$_2$ from first-principles, and we perform enhanced thermal transport
computations by evaluating the phonon Green's function via self-consistent
diagrammatic perturbation theory. Our predicted phonon lifetimes at $T=600$ K
agree well with our inelastic neutron scattering measurements across the entire
Brillouin zone, and our thermal conductivity predictions agree well with
previous measurements. Both the changes due to thermal expansion and
self-consistent contributions are nontrivial at high temperatures, though the
effects tend to cancel, and interband transitions yield a substantial
contribution.
