<h3>GPT-4 as an interface between researchers and computational software:  improving usability and reproducibility</h3>

Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly important role in
science and engineering. For example, their ability to parse and understand
human and computer languages makes them powerful interpreters and their use in
applications like code generation are well-documented. We explore the ability
of the GPT-4 LLM to ameliorate two major challenges in computational materials
science: i) the high barriers for adoption of scientific software associated
with the use of custom input languages, and ii) the poor reproducibility of
published results due to insufficient details in the description of simulation
methods. We focus on a widely used software for molecular dynamics simulations,
the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS), and
quantify the usefulness of input files generated by GPT-4 from task
descriptions in English and its ability to generate detailed descriptions of
computational tasks from input files. We find that GPT-4 can generate correct
and ready-to-use input files for relatively simple tasks and useful starting
points for more complex, multi-step simulations. In addition, GPT-4's
description of computational tasks from input files can be tuned from a
detailed set of step-by-step instructions to a summary description appropriate
for publications. Our results show that GPT-4 can reduce the number of routine
tasks performed by researchers, accelerate the training of new users, and
enhance reproducibility.

<h3>Quantum geometry induced nonlinear transport in altermagnets</h3>

Quantum geometry plays a pivotal role in the second-order response of $\cal
PT$-symmetric antiferromagnets. Here we study the nonlinear response of 2D
altermagnets protected by $C_n\cal T$ symmetry and show that their leading
nonlinear response is third-order. Furthermore, we show that the contributions
from the quantum metric and Berry curvature enter separately: the longitudinal
response for all planar altermagnets \emph{only} has a contribution from the
quantum metric quadrupole (QMQ), while transverse responses in general have
contributions from both the Berry curvature quadrupole (BCQ) and QMQ. We show
that for the well-known example of $d$-wave altermagnets the Hall response is
dominated by the BCQ. Both longitudinal and transverse responses are strongly
dependent on the crystalline anisotropy. While altermagnets are strictly
defined in the limit of vanishing SOC, real altermagnets exhibit weak SOC,
which is essential to observe this response. Specifically, SOC gaps the
spin-group protected nodal line, generating a response peak that is sharpest
when SOC is weak. Two Dirac nodes also contribute a divergence to the nonlinear
response, whose scaling changes as a function of SOC. Finally, we apply our
results to thin films of the 3D altermagnet RuO$_2$. Our work uncovers distinct
features of altermagnets in nonlinear transport, providing experimental
signatures as well as a guide to disentangling the different components of
their quantum geometry.

<h3>Strong enhancement of superconductivity in finitely ramified fractal  lattices</h3>

Using the Sierpinski gasket (triangle) and carpet (square) lattices as
examples, we theoretically study the properties of fractal superconductors. For
that, we focus on the phenomenon of $s$-wave superconductivity in the Hubbard
model with attractive on-site potential and employ the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
approach and the theory of superfluid stiffness. For the case of the Sierpinski
gasket, we demonstrate that fractal geometry of the underlying crystalline
lattice can be strongly beneficial for superconductivity, not only leading to a
considerable increase of the critical temperature $T_c$ as compared to the
regular triangular lattice but also supporting macroscopic phase coherence of
the Cooper pairs. In contrast, the Sierpinski carpet geometry does not lead to
pronounced effects, and we find no substantial difference as compared with the
regular square lattice. We conjecture that the qualitative difference between
these cases is caused by different ramification properties of the fractals.

<h3>Cut it out: Out-of-plane stresses in cell sheet folding of Volvox  embryos</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11517" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11517</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The folding of cellular monolayers pervades embryonic development and
disease. It results from stresses out of the plane of the tissue, often caused
by cell shape changes including cell wedging via apical constriction. These
local cellular changes need not however be compatible with the global shape of
the tissue. Such geometric incompatibilities lead to residual stresses that
have out-of-plane components in curved tissues, but the mechanics and function
of these out-of-plane stresses are poorly understood, perhaps because their
quantification has proved challenging. Here, we overcome this difficulty by
combining laser ablation experiments and a mechanical model to reveal that such
out-of-plane residual stresses exist and also persist during the inversion of
the spherical embryos of the green alga Volvox. We show how to quantify the
mechanical properties of the curved tissue from its unfurling on ablation, and
reproduce the tissue shape sequence at different developmental timepoints
quantitatively by our mechanical model. Strikingly, this reveals not only clear
mechanical signatures of out-of-plane stresses associated with cell shape
changes away from those regions where cell wedging bends the tissue, but also
indicates an adaptive response of the tissue to these stresses. Our results
thus suggest that cell sheet folding is guided mechanically not only by cell
wedging, but also by out-of-plane stresses from these additional cell shape
changes.

<h3>Quantum spin chains with bond dissipation</h3>

<br>
<i>Manuel Weber</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effect of bond dissipation on the one-dimensional
antiferromagnetic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model. In analogy to the spin-Peierls
problem, the dissipative bath is described by local harmonic oscillators that
modulate the spin exchange coupling, but instead of a single boson frequency we
consider a continuous bath spectrum $\propto \omega^s$. Using an exact quantum
Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions, we show that for $s<1$ any finite
coupling to the bath induces valence-bond-solid order, whereas for $s>1$ the
critical phase of the isolated chain remains stable up to a finite critical
coupling. We find that, even in the presence of the gapless bosonic spectrum,
the spin-triplet gap remains well defined for any system size, from which we
extract a dynamical critical exponent of $z=1$. We provide evidence for a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition that is governed by
the SU(2)$_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Our results suggest that the critical
properties of the dissipative system are the same as for the spin-Peierls
model, irrespective of the different interaction range, i.e., power-law vs.
exponential decay, of the retarded dimer-dimer interaction, indicating that the
spin-Peierls criticality is robust with respect to the bosonic density of
states.

<br>
<br>
We reveal in this study the fundamental low-energy landscape in the
ferrimagnetic Sr2CrReO6 double perovskite and describe the underlying
mechanisms responsible for the three low-energy excitations below 1.4 eV. Based
on resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and magnetic dynamics calculations, and
experiments collected from both Sr2CrReO6 powders and epitaxially strained thin
films, we reveal a strong competition between spin-orbit coupling, Hund's
coupling, and the strain-induced tetragonal crystal field. We also demonstrate
that a spin-flip process is at the origin of the lowest excitation at 200 meV,
and we bring insights into the predicted presence of orbital ordering in this
material. We study the nature of the magnons through a combination of ab initio
and spin-wave theory calculations, and show that two nondegenerate magnon bands
exist and are dominated either by rhenium or chromium spins. The rhenium band
is found to be flat at about 200 meV ($\pm$25 meV) through X-L-W-U
high-symmetry points and is dispersive toward $\Gamma$

<h3>Skyrmion Transport and Annihilation in Funnel Geometries</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using atomistic simulations, we have investigated the transport and
annihilation of skyrmions interacting with a funnel array under a current
applied perpendicular to the funnel axis. We find that transport without
annihilation is possible at low currents, when the motion is dominated by
skyrmion-skyrmion interactions and skyrmions push each other through the funnel
opening. Skyrmion annihilation occurs for higher currents when skyrmions in the
upper half of the sample exert pressure on skyrmions in the bottom half of the
sample due to the external current. Upon interacting with the funnel wall, the
skyrmions undergo a size reduction that makes it easier for them to pass
through the funnel opening. We find five phases as a function of the applied
current and the size of the funnel opening: (i) pinned, (ii) transport without
annihilation, (iii) transport with annihilation, (iv) complete annihilation,
and (v) a reentrant pinning phase that only occurs for very narrow openings.
Our findings provide insight into how to control skyrmion transport using
funnel arrays by delineating regimes in which transport of skyrmions is
possible as well as the conditions under which annihilation occurs.

<h3>Intertwined fractional quantum anomalous Hall states and charge density  waves</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11632</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent experimental breakthrough on the observation of the
fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects in semiconductor and graphene
moir\'{e} materials, we explore the rich physics associated with the
intertwinement between FQAH effect and the charge density wave (CDW) order that
spontaneously breaks the translation symmetry. We refer to a state with
coexisting FQAH effect and CDW order as "FQAH-crystal". We show that the
interplay between FQAH effect and CDW can lead to a rich phase diagram
including multiple topological phases and topological quantum phase transitions
at the same moir\'e filling. In particular, we demonstrate the possibility of
direct quantum phase transitions from a FQAH-crystal with Hall conductivity
$\sigma_H = - 2/3$ to a trivial CDW insulator with $\sigma_H = 0$, and more
interestingly, to a QAH-crystal with $\sigma_H= -1$.

<h3>Towards a Topological Classification of Nonadiabaticity in Chemical  Reactions</h3>

The application of topology, a branch of mathematics, to the study of
electronic states in crystalline materials has had a revolutionary impact on
the field of condensed matter physics. For example, the development of
topological band theory has delivered new approaches and tools to characterize
the electronic structure of materials, resulting in the discovery of new phases
of matter with exotic properties. In the framework of topological band theory,
the crossings between energy levels of electrons are characterized by
topological invariants, which predict the presence of topological boundary
states. Given the frequency of energy level crossings on the potential energy
surface in molecules, the applicability of these concepts to molecular systems
could be of great interest for our understanding of reaction dynamics. However,
challenges arise due to differing quantum mechanical descriptions of solids and
molecules. Out work aims to bridge the gap between topological band theory and
molecular chemistry. We propose that the Euler Class, a topological invariant,
can be used to categorize and analyse the distribution of nonadiabatic
couplings on the potential energy surface. To exemplify this connection, we
introduce a model system with two distinct regimes that are characterized by
different values of the Euler Class, yet identical potential energy surfaces.
Contrary to expectations set by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we propose
that these two regimes don't exhibit identical dynamics, due to a qualitatively
distinct distribution of nonadiabatic couplings.

<h3>Dirac quantum spin liquid emerging in a kagome-lattice antiferromagnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
Emerging quasi-particles with Dirac dispersion in condensed matter physics
are analogous to their cousins in high-energy physics in that both of them can
be described by the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons. Recently, these
Dirac fermions have been widely found in electronic systems, such as graphene
and topological insulators. At the conceptual level, since the charge is not a
prerequisite for Dirac fermions, the emergence of Dirac fermions without charge
degree of freedom has been theoretically predicted to be realized in Dirac
quantum spin liquids. In such case, the Dirac quasiparticles are charge-neutral
and carry a spin of 1/2, known as spinons. Despite of theoretical aspirations,
spectra evidence of Dirac spinons remains elusive. Here we show that the spin
excitations of a kagome antiferromagnet,
YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], are conical with a spin continuum
inside, which are consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. The
spinon velocity obtained from the spin excitations also quantitatively
reproduces the low-temperature specific heat of the sample. Interestingly, the
locations of the conical spin excitations differ from those calculated by the
nearest neighbor Heisenberg model, suggesting an unexpected origin of the Dirac
spinons. Our results thus provide strong spectra evidence for the Dirac
quantum-spin-liquid state emerging in this kagome-lattice antiferromagnet.

<h3>Chiral topological metals with multiple types of quasiparticle fermions  and large spin Hall effect in the SrGePt family materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11668" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11668</a>

We present a prediction of chiral topological metals with several classes of
unconventional quasiparticle fermions in a family of SrGePt-type materials in
terms of first-principles calculations. In these materials, fourfold spin-3/2
Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) fermion, sixfold excitation, and Weyl fermions
coexist around the Fermi level as spin-orbit coupling is considered, and the
Chern number for the first two kinds of fermions is the maximal value four. We
found that large Fermi arcs from spin-3/2 RSW fermion emerge on the
(010)-surface, spanning the whole surface Brillouin zone. Moreover, there exist
Fermi arcs originating from Weyl points, which further overlap with trivial
bulk bands. In addition, we revealed that the large spin Hall conductivity can
be obtained, which attributed to the remarkable spin Berry curvature around the
degenerate nodes and band-splitting induced by spin-orbit coupling. Our
findings indicate that the SrGePt family of compounds provide an excellent
platform for studying on topological electronic states and the intrinsic spin
Hall effect.

Realizing topological semimetal states with novel emergent fermions in
magnetic materials is a focus of current research. Based on first-principle
calculations and symmetry analysis, we reveal interesting magnetic emergent
fermions in an existing material MnB2. In the temperature range from 157 K to
760 K, MnB2 is a collinear antiferromagnet. We find the coexistence of
eightfold nodal points and nodal net close to the Fermi level, which are
protected by the spin group in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Depending on
the Neel vector orientation, consideration of spin-orbit coupling will either
open small gaps at these nodal features, or transform them into magnetic linear
and quadratic Dirac points and nodal rings. Below 157 K, MnB2 acquires weak
ferromagnetism due to spin tilting. We predict that this transition is
accompanied by a drastic change in anomalous Hall response, from zero above 157
K to 200 $\Omega\cdot \text{cm}^{-1}$ below 157 K.

Nanofabrication is an integral part of realization of advanced functional
devices ranging from optical displays to memory devices. Focused ion beam (FIB)
milling is one of the widely used nanofabrication methods. Conventionally, FIB
milling has been carried out for patterning single-phase stable thin films.
However, the influence of FIB milling on phase separation of metastable alloy
films during subsequent treatments has not been reported. Here, we show how FIB
milling of Ag-Cu thin films influences the separation process and
microstructure formation during post-milling annealing. Phase-separated
microstructure of the film consists of fine, randomly distributed Ag-rich and
Cu-rich domains, whereas adjacent to milled apertures (cylindrical holes), we
observe two distinctly coarser rings. A combination of imaging and analysis
techniques reveals Cu-rich islands dispersed in Ag-rich domains in the first
ring next to the aperture, while the second ring constitutes mostly of Ag-rich
grains. Copper silicide is observed to form in and around apertures through
reaction with the Si-substrate. This substrate interaction, in addition to
known variables like composition, temperature, and capillarity, appears to be a
key element in drastically changing the local microstructure around apertures.
This current study introduces new avenues to locally modulate the composition
and microstructure through an appropriate choice of the film-substrate system.
Such an ability can be exploited further to tune device functionalities with
possible applications in plasmonics, catalysis, microelectronics and magnetics.

<h3>Finite-Size Scaling of the High-Dimensional Ising Model in the Loop  Representation</h3>

Besides its original spin representation, the Ising model is known to have
the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) bond and loop representations, of which the former
was recently shown to exhibit two upper critical dimensions $(d_c=4,d_p=6)$.
Using a lifted worm algorithm, we determine the critical coupling as $K_c =
0.077\,708\,91(4)$ for $d=7$, which significantly improves over the previous
results, and then study critical geometric properties of the loop-Ising
clusters on tori for spatial dimensions $d=5$ to 7. We show that, as the spin
representation, the loop Ising model has only one upper critical dimension at
$d_c=4$. However, sophisticated finite-size scaling (FSS) behaviors, like two
length scales, two configuration sectors and two scaling windows, still exist
as the interplay effect of the Gaussian fixed point and complete-graph
asymptotics. Moreover, using the Loop-Cluster algorithm, we provide an
intuitive understanding of the emergence of the percolation-like upper critical
dimension $d_p=6$ in the FK-Ising model. As a consequence, a unified physical
picture is established for the FSS behaviors in all the three representations
of the Ising model above $d_c=4$.

We investigate the interaction between highly excited Rydberg excitons and
charged impurities in the semiconductor Cuprous Oxide. We find that it is
long-ranged and based on charge-induced dipole interactions. We demonstrate
that we can utilize this interaction to neutralize impurities throughout the
whole crystal - an effect we call purification. Purification reduces
detrimental electrical stray fields drastically. We find that the absorption of
the purified crystal increases by up to 25 % and that the purification effect
is long-lived and may persist for hundreds of microseconds or even longer.
Using a time-resolved pump-probe technique, we can discriminate purification
from Rydberg blockade, which has been a long-standing goal in excitonic Rydberg
systems.

Reservoir computing has been considered as a promising intelligent computing
paradigm for effectively processing complex temporal information. Exploiting
tunable and reproducible dynamics in the single electronic device have been
desired to implement the reservoir and the readout layer of reservoir computing
system. Two-dimensional moire material, with an artificial lattice constant
many times larger than the atomic length scale, is one type of most studied
artificial quantum materials in community of material science and
condensed-matter physics over the past years. These materials are featured with
gate-tunable periodic potential and electronic correlation, thus varying the
electric field allows the electrons in the moire potential per unit cell to
exhibit distinct and reproducible dynamics, showing great promise in robust
reservoir computing. Here, we report that a moire synaptic transistor can be
used to implement the reservoir computing system with a homogeneous
reservoir-readout architecture. The synaptic transistor is fabricated based on
a h-BN/bilayer graphene/h-BN moire heterostructure, exhibiting
ferroelectricity-like hysteretic gate voltage dependence of resistance. Varying
the magnitude of the gate voltage enables the moire transistor to be switched
between long-term memory and short-term memory with nonlinear dynamics. By
employing the short- and long-term memory as the reservoir nodes and weights of
the readout layer, respectively, we construct a full-moire physical neural
network and demonstrate that the classification accuracy of 90.8% can be
achieved for the MNIST handwritten digit database. Our work would pave the way
towards the development of neuromorphic computing based on the moire materials.

We revisit the issue about the magnetization of the $120^\circ$ order in the
spin-1/2 triangular lattice Heisenberg model (TLHM) with Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG). The accurate determination of the magnetization
of this model is challenging for numerical methods and its value exhibits
substantial disparities across various methods. We perform a large-scale DMRG
calculation of this model by employing bond dimension as large as $D = 24000$
and by studying the system with width as large as $L_\mathrm{y} = 12$. With
careful extrapolation with truncation error and suitable finite size scaling,
we give a conservative estimation of the magnetization as $M_0 = 0.208(8)$. The
ground state energy per site we obtain is $E_g = -0.5503(8)$. Our results
provide valuable benchmark values for the development of new methods in the
future.

Transport in complex networks can describe a variety of natural and
human-engineered processes including biological, societal and technological
ones. However, how the properties of the source and drain nodes can affect
transport subject to random failures, attacks or maintenance optimization in
the network remain unknown. In this paper, the effects of both the distance
between the source and drain nodes and of the degree of the source node on the
time of transport collapse are studied in scale-free and lattice-based
transport networks. These effects are numerically evaluated for two strategies,
which employ either transport-based or random link removal. Scale-free networks
with small distances are found to result in larger times of collapse. In
lattice-based networks, both the dimension and boundary conditions are shown to
have a major effect on the time of collapse. We also show that adding a direct
link between the source and the drain increases the robustness of scale-free
networks when subject to random link removals. Interestingly, the distribution
of the times of collapse is then similar to the one of lattice-based networks.

<h3>Topological phase locking in dissipatively-coupled noise-activated  processes</h3>

We study a minimal model of two non-identical noise-activated oscillators
that interact with each other through a dissipative coupling. We find that the
system exhibits a rich variety of dynamical behaviors, including a novel
phase-locking phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL). TPL is
characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus
knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational
multiples of each other, which coexists with the basin of attraction of the
stable fixed point. We show that TPL arises as a result of a complex hierarchy
of global bifurcations. Even if the system remains noise-activated, the
existence of the band of periodic orbits enables effectively deterministic
dynamics, resulting in a greatly enhanced speed of the oscillators. Our results
have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems,
from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered electronic, optical,
or mechanical oscillators.

In many physical situations in which many-body assemblies exist at
temperature $T$, a characteristic quantum-mechanical time scale of
approximately $\hbar/k_{B}T$ can be identified in both theory and experiment,
leading to speculation that it may be the shortest meaningful time in such
circumstances. When this behaviour is investigated by probing the scattering
rate of strongly interacting electrons in metals, it is clear that in some
cases only electron-electron scattering can be its cause, while in others it
arises from high-temperature scattering of electrons from quantised lattice
vibrations, i.e. phonons. In metallic oxides, which are among the most studied
materials, analysis of electrical transport does not satisfactorily identify
the relevant scattering mechanism at 'high' temperatures near room temperature.
We employ a contactless optical method to measure thermal diffusivity in two
Ru-based layered perovskites, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, and use the
measurements to extract the dimensionless Lorenz ratio. By comparing our
results to the literature data on both conventional and unconventional metals
we show how the analysis of high-temperature thermal transport can both give
important insight into dominant scattering mechanisms, and be offered as a
stringent test of theories attempting to explain anomalous scattering.

Quadratic nodal point (QNP) in two dimensions has so far been reported only
in nonmagnetic materials and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Here, by
first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we predict stable QNP near
Fermi level in a two-dimensional kagome metal-organic framework material,
Cr$_3$(HAB)$_2$, which features noncollinear antiferromagnetic ordering and
sizable spin-orbit coupling. Effective kp and lattice models are constructed to
capture such magnetic QNPs. Besides QNP, we find Cr$_3$(HAB)$_2$ also hosts six
magnetic linear nodal points protected by mirror as well as $C_{2z}T$ symmetry.
Properties associated to these nodal points, such as topological edge states
and quantized optical absorbance, are discussed.

<br>
Defect-mediated nonradiative recombination, known as Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH)
recombination is reformulated. The introduced model considers Coulomb
attraction between charged deep defect and the approaching free carrier,
showing that this effect may cause considerable increase of the carrier
velocity approaching the recombination center. The effect considerably
increases the carrier capture rates. It is demonstrated that in the typical
semiconductor device or semiconductor medium, the SRH recombination cannot be
neglected at low temperatures. The SRH is more effective in the case of low
doped semiconductors. Effective screening by mobile carrier density could
reduce the effect, leading to SRH rate increase.

<br>
<br>
Several theoretical approaches to disordered media predict that acoustic
waves should undergo a quartic increase in their attenuation coefficient with
increasing frequency in the sub-terahertz region. Such Rayleigh-type scattering
would be related to the anomalous low-temperature plateau in the thermal
conductivity and to the so-called boson peak, i.e. an excess of vibrational
modes above the Debye density of states at around 1 THz. Brillouin scattering
of light allows the measurement of sound absorption and velocity dispersion up
to about 0.1 THz while inelastic x-ray scattering is limited to frequencies
larger than about 1 THz. We take advantage of the advent of ultrafast optical
techniques to explore the acoustical properties of amorphous SiO2 layers in the
difficult but crucial frequency region within this gap. A quartic scaling law
with frequency is clearly revealed between 0.2 and 0.9 THz, which is further
shown to be independent of temperature. This strongly damped regime is
accompanied by a decrease in the sound velocity already starting from about 0.5
THz, in line with theories. Our study assists to clarify the anomalous
acoustical properties in glasses at frequencies entering the boson peak region.

We characterize the current-carrying nonequilibrium steady-state in a
single-band Hubbard model confronted with a static electric field in the
presence of quenched disorder. As disorder is not expected to dissipate the
extra energy injected by the field, optical phonons assisted by a fermionic
heat bath serve as dissipation channels for the current-induced Joule heat
generated by the accelerated electrons. In a purely electronic setup, the
disorder-induced dephasing cannot contribute states within the gap but only
smear out the edges of the Hubbard bands. When phonons are taken into account,
the different nature of disorder-induced dephasing and phonon-related
dissipation becomes clear. We show that although both disorder and
electron-phonon interaction enhance the current at off-resonant fields,
disorder effects play a marginal role since they cannot provide in-gap states
which are instead brought about by phonons and represent the privileged
relaxation pathway for excited electrons.

Antiferromagnets (AFMs) exhibit spin arrangements with no net magnetization,
positioning them as promising candidates for spintronics applications. While
electrical manipulation of the single-crystal AFMs, composed of periodic spin
configurations, is achieved recently, it remains a daunting challenge to
characterize and to manipulate polycrystalline AFMs. Utilizing statistical
analysis in data science, we demonstrate that polycrystalline AFMs can be
described using a real, symmetric, positive semi-definite, rank-two tensor,
which we term the Neel tensor. This tensor introduces a unique spin torque,
diverging from the conventional field-like and Slonczewski torques in
spintronics devices. Remarkably, Neel tensors can be trained to retain a
specific orientation, functioning as a form of working memory. This attribute
enables zero-field spin-orbit-torque switching in trilayer devices featuring a
heavy-metal/ferromagnet/AFM structure and is also consistent with the X-ray
magnetic linear dichroism measurements. Our findings uncover hidden statistical
patterns in polycrystalline AFMs and establishes the presence of Neel tensor
torque, highlighting its potential to drive future spintronics innovations.

Understanding the morphology formation process of solution-cast photoactive
layers (PALs) is crucial to derive design rules for optimized and reliable
third generation solar cell fabrication. For this purpose, a Phase-Field (PF)
computational framework dedicated to the simulation of PAL processing has
recently been developed. In this study focused on non-evaporating,
crystallizing binary mixtures, distinct crystalline morphology formation
pathways are characterized by a systematic exploration of the model's parameter
space. It is identified how, depending on material properties, regular,
dilution-enhanced, diffusion-limited and demixing-assisted crystallization can
take place, and which associated structures then arise. A comprehensive
description of the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms that respectively drive
these separate crystallization modes is provided. Finally, comparisons with
experimental results reported in the literature highlight the promising
potential of PF simulations to support the determination of process-structure
relationships for improved PAL production.

A new superstructure of layered pristine LiNiO2 (LNO) was obtained optimizing
a large supercell of the 166 space group, the one observed experimentally by
XRD, and relaxing both cell parameters and internal positions. The crystal
structure shows size and charge disproportionation of the NiO6 octahedra
instead of the Jahn-Teller distortion. The decrease of the internal energy
obtained with the structural optimization of the supercell relative to the same
structure in its primitive unit cell is much larger than the one obtained by
relaxing similarly dimensioned supercells of monoclinic symmetry relative to
their primitive unit cells, although the monoclinic phase remains more stable.
The Ni-O bond length distribution of the new structure agree well with the
experiments. Our results show that the choice of the simulation cell is
important for determining the energetics of this class of oxide materials,
proposed for cathodes in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). We used this new
structure as a template for the study of the structural and electronic changes
induced by the delithiation and Mn for Ni cation substitution, originating the
solid solutions LiNiyMn(1-y)O2 (LNMO). Our results, surprisingly, agree well
with the existing experiments and explain observed trends better than previous
studies.

Despite the fundamental importance of solid-solid transformations in many
technologies, the microscopic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we
explore the atomistic mechanisms at the migrating interface during solid-solid
phase transformations between the topologically closed-packed A15 and
body-centred cubic phase in tungsten. The high energy barriers and slow
dynamics associated with this transformation require the application of
enhanced molecular sampling approaches. To this end, we performed metadynamics
simulations in combination with a path collective variable derived from a
machine learning classification of local structural environments, which allows
the system to freely sample the complex interface structure. A disordered
region of varying width forming at the migrating interface is identified as a
key physical descriptor of the transformation mechanisms, facilitating the
atomic shuffling and rearrangement necessary for structural transformations.
Furthermore, this can directly be linked to the differences in interface
mobility for distinct orientation relationships as well as the formation of
interfacial ledges during the migration along low-mobility directions.

<br>
<br>
Second-order phase transitions are governed by spontaneous symmetry breaking,
which yield collective excitations with a gapless spectrum called
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes. While NG modes in conservative systems are
propagating excitations, non-equilibrium phase transitions have been predicted
to feature a diffusive NG mode. We present the first experimental evidence of a
diffusive NG mode in a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate of microcavity
polaritons. The NG mode is observed as a spectral narrowing in the
spectroscopic response of the condensate. Additionally, explicitly breaking the
symmetry causes the opening of a gap in the spectrum and the disappearance of
the NG mode. Our observations confirm the diffusive dynamics of the NG mode of
non-equilibrium phase transitions and establish a promising framework to
investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics.

The extremely high pseudo-magnetic field emerging in strained graphene
suggests that an oscillating nano-deformation will induce a very high current
even without electric bias. In this paper, we demonstrate the sub-terahertz
(THz) dynamics of a valley-current and the corresponding charge pumping with a
periodically excited nano-bubble. We discuss the amplitude of the
pseudo-electric field and investigate the dependence of the pumped valley
current on the different parameters of the system. Finally, we report the
signature of extra-harmonics generation in the valley current that might lead
to potential modern devices development operating in the nonlinear regime

Achieving thermal equilibrium in two-dimensional lattices of interacting
nanomagnets has been a key issue on the route to study exotic phases in
artificial frustrated magnets. We revisit this issue in artificial
one-dimensional kagom\'e spin chains. Imaging arrested micro-states generated
by a field demagnetization protocol and analyzing their pairwise spin
correlations in real space, we unveil a non-equilibrated physics. Remarkably,
this physics can be reformulated into an at-equilibrium one by rewriting the
associated spin Hamiltonian in such a way that one of the coupling constants is
quenched. We ascribe this effective behavior to a kinetic hinderance during the
demagnetization protocol, which induces the formation of local flux closure
spin configurations that sometimes compete with the magnetostatic interaction.

Quantum path interferences occur whenever multiple equivalent and coherent
transitions result in a common final state. Such interferences strongly modify
the probability of a particle to be found in that final state, a key concept of
quantum coherent control. When multiple nonlinear and energy-degenerate
transitions occur in a system, the multitude of possible quantum path
interferences is hard to disentangle experimentally. Here, we analyze quantum
path interferences during the nonlinear emission of electrons from hybrid
plasmonic and photonic fields using time-resolved photoemission electron
microscopy. We experimentally distinguish quantum path interferences by
exploiting the momentum difference between photons and plasmons and through
balancing the relative contributions of their respective fields. Our work
provides a fundamental understanding of the nonlinear photon-plasmon-electron
interaction. Distinguishing emission processes in momentum space, as introduced
here, will ultimately allow nano-optical quantum-correlations to be studied
without destroying the quantum path interferences.

Nanoporous metals with a random, bicontinuous structure of both pores and
ligaments exhibit many unique mechanical properties, but their technical
applications are often limited by their intrinsic brittleness under tensile
strain triggered by fracture of the weakest ligaments. Here, we use molecular
dynamics simulations to study the mechanical behavior and thermal stability of
two different bicontinuous nanoporous high entropy alloys, Al0.1CoCrFeNi and
NbMoTaW. To isolate the properties related to the nanoporous nature of our
samples, we also studied the corresponding bulk and nanocrystalline systems.
The results demonstrate that the specific modulus of nanoporous HEAs are 2 to 3
times greater than that of single element nanoporous materials with specific
strength reaching values 5 to 10 times higher, comparable to bulk metals with
the highest specific strength. Bicontinuous HEAs also displayed excellent
resistance to thermal degradation as evidenced by the absence of coarsening
ligaments up to temperatures of 1273 K which ensures the durability and
reliability in high-temperature applications. The findings uncover
unprecedented mechanical and thermal properties of bicontinuous nanoporous high
entropy alloys, paving the way for their promising utilization in advanced
engineering and structural applications.

<h3>Valley-dependent tunneling through electrostatically created quantum  dots in heterostructures of graphene with hexagonal boron nitride</h3>

Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) has been employed to probe charge
carriers in a graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure [Nano
Lett, 21, 5013 (2021)]. We propose an approach for operating valley filtering
based on the KPFM-induced potential $U_0$ instead of using external or induced
pseudo-magnetic fields in strained graphene. Employing a tight-binding model,
we investigate the parameters and rules leading to valley filtering in the
presence of a graphene quantum dot (GQD) created by the KPFM tip. This model
leads to a resolution of different transport channels in reciprocal space,
where the electron transmission probability at each Dirac cone ($K_1$= -K and
$K_2$ = +K) is evaluated separately. The results show that U0 and the Fermi
energy $E_F$ control (or invert) the valley polarization, if electrons are
allowed to flow through a given valley. The resulting valley filtering is
allowed only if the signs of $E_F$ and $U_0$ are the same. If they are
different, the valley filtering is destroyed and might occur only at some
resonant states affected by $U_0$. Additionally, there are independent valley
modes characterizing the conductance oscillations near the vicinity of the
resonances, whose strength increases with $U_0$ and are similar to those
occurring in resonant tunneling in quantum antidots and to the Fabry-Perot
oscillations. Using KPFM, to probe the charge carriers, and graphene-based
structures to control valley transport, provides an efficient way for attaining
valley filtering without involving external or pseudo-magnetic fields as in
previous proposals.

localization stabilizes the chaotic dynamical phase.

Magnetic properties of Mott-Hubbard insulators are determined by
superexchange interactions mediated by the high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS)
intersite d-d charge excitations, which can be associated with the HS- and
LS-Hubbard subbands in optical experiments. To explore the Mott-Hubbard physics
in orthorhombic LaTiO_3 crystal exhibiting the G-type antiferromagnetic order
at the Neel temperature T_N = 146 K, we present a comprehensive spectroscopic
ellipsometry study in the spectral range 0.5-5.6 eV at temperatures 10 K < T <
300 K. We found that the complex dielectric function spectra of LaTiO_3 crystal
are almost featureless, nearly isotropic, and weakly temperature dependent in
the range of d-d optical transitions. Nonetheless, analyzing the difference
spectra below the T_N, we have identified the LS-state d^1d^1 - d^2d^0
excitations at ~3.7 and ~5.15 eV and estimated values of the on-site Coulomb
repulsion U ~4.2 eV and Hund's exchange constant J_H ~0.5 eV, which define the
energy of the HS-state d^1d^1 - d^2d^0 excitation at ~2.7 eV. In addition, we
discovered that the pronounced lowest-energy 1.3 eV optical band displays the
critical intensity behavior and anomalous broadening with decreasing
temperature below the T_N. The discovered properties indicate that the 1.3 eV
band in LaTiO_3 can be associated with a Mott-Hubbard exciton.

We study the effects of interband pairing in two-band s-wave and d-wave
superconductors with D4h symmetry in both time-reversal invariant as well as
time-reversal symmetry breaking states. The presence of interband pairing
qualitatively changes the nodal structure of the superconductor: nodes can
(dis)appear, merge, and leave high-symmetry locations when interband pairing is
tuned. Furthermore, in the d-wave case, we find that also the boundary modes
change qualitatively when interband pairing increases: flat zero-energy Andreev
bound states gap out and transition to helical edge states.

The high-pressure compaction of three dimensional granular packings is
simulated using a bonded particle model (BPM) to capture linear elastic
deformation. In the model, grains are represented by a collection of point
particles connected by bonds. A simple multibody interaction is introduced to
control Poisson's ratio and the arrangement of particles on the surface of a
grain is varied to model both high- and low-frictional grains. At low
pressures, the growth in packing fraction and coordination number follow the
expected behavior near jamming and exhibit friction dependence. As the pressure
increases, deviations from the low-pressure power-law scaling emerge after the
packing fraction grows by approximately 0.1 and results from simulations with
different friction coefficients converge. These results are compared to
predictions from traditional discrete element method simulations which,
depending on the definition of packing fraction and coordination number, may
only differ by a factor of two. As grains deform under compaction, the average
volumetric strain and asphericity, a measure of the change in the shape of
grains, are found to grow as power laws and depend heavily on the Poisson's
ratio of the constituent solid. Larger Poisson's ratios are associated with
less volumetric strain and more asphericity and the apparent power-law exponent
of the asphericity may vary. The elastic properties of the packed grains are
also calculated as a function of packing fraction. In particular, we find the
Poisson's ratio near jamming is 1/2 but decreases to 1/4 before rising again as
systems densify.

Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms serve as low-entropy sources for
a multitude of quantum-science applications, ranging from quantum simulation
and quantum many-body physics to proof-of-principle experiments in quantum
metrology and quantum computing. For stability reasons, in the majority of
cases the energetically lowest-lying atomic spin state is used. Here we report
the Bose-Einstein condensation of caesium atoms in the Zeeman-excited mf = 2
state, realizing a non-ground-state Bose-Einstein condensate with tunable
interactions and tunable loss. We identify two regions of magnetic field in
which the two-body relaxation rate is low enough that condensation is possible.
We characterize the phase transition and quantify the loss processes, finding
unusually high three-body losses in one of the two regions. Our results open up
new possibilities for the mixing of quantum-degenerate gases, for polaron and
impurity physics, and in particular for the study of impurity transport in
strongly correlated one-dimensional quantum wires.

Surprisingly little is known about the microscopic processes that govern
ferroelectric switching in orthorhombic ferroelectrics.
To study microscopic switching processes we combine ab initio-based molecular
dynamics simulations and data science on the prototypical material BaTiO$_3$.
We reveal two different field regimes: For moderate field strengths, the
switching is dominated by domain wall motion while a fast bulk-like switching
can be induced for large fields. Switching in both field regimes follows a
multi-step process via polarization directions perpendicular to the applied
field. In the former case, the moving wall is of Bloch character and hosts
dipole vortices due to nucleation, growth, and crossing of two dimensional
90$^{\circ}$ domains. In the second case, the local polarization shows a
continuous correlated rotation via a an intermediate tetragonal multidomain
state.

We report on a ballistic and fully tunable Josephson junction system
consisting of two parallel ribbons of graphene in contact with superconducting
MoRe. By electrostatic gating of the two individual graphene ribbons we gain
control over the real space distribution of the superconducting current
density, which can be continuously tuned between both ribbons. We extract the
respective gate dependent spatial distributions of the real space current
density by employing Fourier- and Hilbert transformations of the magnetic field
induced modulation of the critical current. This approach is fast and does not
rely on a symmetric current profile. It is therefore a universally applicable
tool, potentially useful for carefully adjusting Josephson junctions.

Using a reactive molecular beam with high kinetic energy ($E_{kin}$) it is
possible to speed gas-surface reactions involving high activation barriers
($E_{act}$), which would require elevated pressures ($P_0$) if a random gas
with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is used. By simply computing the number
of molecules that overcome the activation barrier in a random gas at $P_0$ and
in a molecular beam at $E_{kin}$=$E_{act}$, we establish an $E_{kin}$-$P_0$
equivalence curve, through which we postulate that molecular beams are ideal
tools to investigate gas-surface reactions that involve high activation
energies. In particular, we foresee the use of molecular beams to simulate gas
surface reactions within the industrial-range ($>$ 10 bar) using
surface-sensitive Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) techniques, such as X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). To test this idea, we revisit the oxidation
of the Cu(111) surface combining O$_2$ molecular beams and XPS experiments. By
tuning the kinetic energy of the O$_2$ beam in the range 0.24-1 eV we achieve
the same sequence of surface oxides obtained in Ambient Pressure Photoemission
(AP-XPS) experiments, in which the Cu(111) surface was exposed to a random
O$_2$ gas up to 1 mbar. We observe the same surface oxidation kinetics as in
the random gas, but with a much lower dose, close to the expected value derived
from the equivalence curve.

We study two-dimensional noble metal chalcogenides, with composition {Cu, Ag,

geometrical frustration. We use for comparison a square lattice, from which the
snub-square tiling can be derived by a simple rotation of the squares. The
mono-layer snub-square chalcogenides are very close to thermodynamic stability,
with the most stable system (Ag2Se) a mere 7 meV/atom above the convex hull of
stability. All compounds studied in the square and snub-square lattice are
semiconductors, with band gaps ranging from 0.1 to more than 2.5 eV. Excitonic
effects are strong, with an exciton binding energy of around 0.3 eV. We propose
the Cu (001) surface as a possible substrate to synthesize Cu2Se, although many
other metal and semiconducting surfaces can be found with very good lattice
matching.

By periodically returning a search process to a known or random state, random
resetting possesses the potential to unveil new trajectories, sidestep
potential obstacles, and consequently enhance the efficiency of locating
desired targets. In this chapter, we highlight the pivotal theoretical
contributions that have enriched our understanding of random resetting within
an abundance of stochastic processes, ranging from standard diffusion to its
fractional counterpart. We also touch upon the general criteria required for
resetting to improve the search process, particularly when distribution
describing the time needed to reach the target is broader compared to a normal
one. Building on this foundation, we delve into real-world applications where
resetting optimizes the efficiency of reaching the desired outcome, spanning
topics from home range search, ion transport to the intricate dynamics of
income. Conclusively, the results presented in this chapter offer a cohesive
perspective on the multifaceted influence of random resetting across diverse
fields.

The complex atomic scale structure of high entropy alloys presents new
opportunities to expand the deformation theories of mechanical metallurgy. In
this regard, solute-defect interactions have emerged as critical piece in
elucidating the operation of deformation mechanisms. While notable progress has
been made in understanding solute-defect interactions for random solute
arrangements, recent interest in high entropy alloys with short-range order
adds a new layer of structural complexity for which a cohesive picture has yet
to emerge. To this end, this minireview synthesizes the current understanding
of short-range order effects on defect behavior through an examination of the
key recent literature. This analysis centers on the nanoscale metallurgy of
deformation mechanisms, with the order-induced changes to the relevant defect
energy landscapes serving as a touchstone for discussion. The topics reviewed
include dislocation-mediated strengthening, twinning and phase
transformation-based mechanisms, and vacancy-mediated processes. This
minireview concludes with remarks on current challenges and opportunities for
future efforts.

We study the spatiotemporal dynamics of ultrafast electron spin transport
across nanometer-thick copper layers using broadband terahertz spectroscopy.
Our analysis of temporal delays, broadening and attenuation of the spin-current
pulse revealed ballistic-like propagation of the pulse peak, approaching the
Fermi velocity, and diffusive features including a significant velocity
dispersion. A comparison to the frequency-dependent Ficks law identified the
diffusion-dominated transport regime for distances larger than 2 nm. The
findings lie the groundwork for designing future broadband spintronic devices.

Two-dimensional materials with Rashba split bands near the Fermi level are
key to developing upcoming next-generation spintronics. They enable generating,
detecting, and manipulating spin currents without an external magnetic field.
Here, we propose BiAs as a novel layered semiconductor with large Rashba
splitting in bulk and monolayer forms. Using first-principles calculations, we
determined the lowest energy structure of BiAs and its basic electronic
properties. Bulk BiAs has a layered crystal structure with two atoms in a
rhombohedral primitive cell, similar to the parent Bi and As elemental phases.
It is a semiconductor with a narrow and indirect band gap. The spin-orbit
coupling leads to Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting and characteristic spin
texture around the L-point in the Brillouin zone of the hexagonal conventional
unit cell, with Rashba energy and Rashba coupling constant for valence
(conduction) band of $E_R$= 137 meV (93 meV) and $\alpha_R$= 6.05 eV\AA~(4.6
eV{\AA}). In monolayer form (i.e., composed of a BiAs bilayer), BiAs has a much
larger and direct band gap at $\Gamma$, with a circular spin texture
characteristic of a pure Rashba effect. The Rashba energy $E_R$= 18 meV and
Rashba coupling constant $\alpha_R$= 1.67 eV{\AA} of monolayer BiAs are quite
large compared to other known 2D materials, and these values are shown to
increase under tensile biaxial strain.

<h3>Symmetric improved estimators for multipoint vertex functions</h3>

Multipoint vertex functions, and the four-point vertex in particular, are
crucial ingredients in many-body theory. Recent years have seen significant
algorithmic progress toward numerically computing their dependence on multiple
frequency arguments. However, such computations remain challenging and are
prone to suffer from numerical artifacts, especially in the real-frequency
domain. Here, we derive estimators for multipoint vertices that are numerically
more robust than those previously available. We show that the two central steps
for extracting vertices from correlators, namely the subtraction of
disconnected contributions and the amputation of external legs, can be achieved
accurately through repeated application of equations of motion, in a manner
that is symmetric with respect to all frequency arguments and involves only
fully renormalized objects. The symmetric estimators express the core part of
the vertex and all asymptotic contributions through separate expressions that
can be computed independently, without subtracting the large-frequency limits
of various terms with different asymptotic behaviors. Our strategy is general
and applies equally to the Matsubara formalism, the real-frequency
zero-temperature formalism, and the Keldysh formalism. We demonstrate the
advantages of the symmetric improved estimators by computing the Keldysh
four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model using the numerical
renormalization group.

<h3>Zigzag materials: selective interchain couplings control the coexistence  of one-dimensional physics and deviations from it</h3>

The coexistence in the low-temperature spin-conducting phases of the zigzag
materials BaCo2V2O8 and SrCo2V2O8 of one-dimensional (1D) physics with
important deviations from it is not well understood. The studies of this paper
account for an important selection rule that follows from interchain spin
states being coupled more strongly within the spin dynamical structure factor
of such zigzag materials whenever they are connected by a specific symmetry
operation of the underlying lattice. In the case of excited states, this
symmetry operation is only a symmetry in spin-space ifno electronic spin flip
is performed within the generation of such states. Our results on both the role
of selective interchain couplings in protecting the 1D physics and being behind
deviations from it and on the dynamical properties being controlled by
scattering of singlet pairs of physical spins 1/2 open the door to a key
advance in the understanding of the physics of the spin chains in BaCo2V2O8 and
SrCo2V2O8.

<h3>Effects of intra-layer correlations on electron-hole double-layer  superfluidity</h3>

We investigate the correlations acting within the layers in a superfluid
system of electron-hole spatially separated layers. In this system of
quasi-dipoles, the dominant correlations are Hartree--Fock. We find in the BEC
regime of the superfluid where screening is negligible, that the effect of the
correlations on superfluid properties is also negligible. However, in the
BCS-BEC crossover regime, where the screening plays a crucial role, we find
that the superfluid gap is significantly weakened because the correlations
significantly boost the number of low-energy particle-hole excitations
participating in the screening process. Finally, the intralayer correlations
are found in this system to suppress a predicted phenomenon in which the
average pair size passes through a minimum as the crossover regime is
traversed. In the presence of intralayer correlations, the minimum is either
extremely weak or completely absent.

<h3>Observation of helimagnetism in the candidate ferroelectric CrI$_2$</h3>

CrI$_{2}$ is a quasi-one dimensional (1D) van der Waals (vdW) system that
exhibits helimagnetism that propagates along the ribbons. This was determined
from neutron time-of-flight diffraction measurements. Below $T_N=17$ K, a
screw-like helimagnetic order develops with an incommensurate wavevector of
$\mathbf{q} \approx (0.2492,0,0)$ at 8 K. Using density functional theory
(DFT)$+U$ calculations, the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ model was leveraged to describe the
helimagnetism, where $J_{1} (> 0)$ and $J_2 (< 0)$ correspond, respectively, to
a ferromagnetic nearest neighbor (NN) and antiferromagnetic next-nearest
neighbor (NNN) intrachain interaction. The DFT$+U$ calculations predict that
bulk CrI$_2$ in the orthorhombic $Cmc2_1$ crystal structure satisfies the
$|J_2| > |J_1|/4$ condition, which favors formation of helimagnetic order.

<h3>Chiral spin textures creation and dynamics in a rectangular  nanostructure</h3>

<br>
Controlled creation of stable chiral spin textures is required to use them as
an energy-efficient information carrier in spintronics. Here we have studied
the stable creation of isolated chiral spin texture (skyrmion and antiskyrmion)
and its pair through the magnetization reversal of a rectangular nanostructure
using spin-polarized currents. An isolated spin texture is created through a
negative current pulse. Dynamics of the stable spin texture are explored under
external magnetic fields, and the resonant frequencies are calculated. A stable
skyrmion pair is created using an asymmetric current pulse, and their
interaction is studied using the Thiele equation. The stability of isolated or
paired spin texture depends on the DMI strength, spin-polarized current
density, and pulse duration. In addition, the stability of the skyrmion pair
depends on their initial separation, and a threshold for the separation between
skyrmions of 78 nm is observed.
