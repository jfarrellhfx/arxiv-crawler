It is demonstrated that self-diffusion and shear viscosity data for the
TIP4P/Ice water model reported recently [L. Baran, W. Rzysko and L. MacDowell,
J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 158}, 064503 (2023)] obey the microscopic version of the
Stokes-Einstein relation without the hydrodynamic diameter.

<h3>Measurement of the excitation spectrum of a dipolar gas in the  macrodroplet regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00003" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00003</a>

<br>
The excitation spectrum of a cigar-shaped strongly dipolar quantum gas at the
crossover from a Bose-Einstein condensate to a trapped macrodroplet is
predicted to exhibit peculiar features - a strong upward shift of low momentum
excitation energies together with a strong multi-band response for high
momenta. By performing Bragg spectroscopy over a wide range of momenta, we
observe both key elements and also confirm the predicted stiffening of
excitation modes when approaching the macrodroplet regime. Our measurements are
in good agreement with numerical calculations taking into account finite size
effects.

<h3>Large circular photocurrent in non-centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl  semimetal CeAlSi</h3>

CeAlSi has been recently identified as a Weyl semimetal with simultaneous
breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. Among many potential
distinguishing features that this may offer, we focus on the nonlinear optical
properties. We present a thorough examination of the injection current,
associated with circular photogalvanic effect, from a first-principles
approach. Our study demonstrates a significant injection current, exceeding
previously reported results in literature. Interestingly, dominant contribution
comes in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition,
we explored several externally adjustable parameters that may have a positive
impact on the circular photocurrent. We uncover a substantial boost in the
photocurrent through the application of uniaxial strain along c-axis of the
crystal $-$ a 5% strain results in a remarkable 62% increment. This provides
insight into the exceptional optoelectronic characteristics of CeAlSi and opens
up potential avenues for novel photogalvanic applications.

<h3>Hall mobilities and sheet carrier densities in a single LiNbO$_3$  conductive ferroelectric domain wall</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00061</a>

<br>
<br>
For the last decade, conductive domain walls (CDWs) in single crystals of the
uniaxial model ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LNO) have shown to
reach resistances more than 10 orders of magnitude lower as compared to the
surrounding bulk, with charge carriers being firmly confined to sheets of a few
nanometers in width. LNO thus currently witnesses an increased attention since
bearing the potential for variably designing room-temperature nanoelectronic
circuits and devices based on such CDWs. In this context, the reliable
determination of the fundamental transport parameters of LNO CDWs, in
particular the 2D charge carrier density $n_{2D}$ and their mobility $\mu_{H}$,
are of highest interests. In this contribution here, we present and apply a
robust and easy-to-prepare Hall-effect measurement setup, by adapting the
standard 4-probe van-der-Pauw method to contacting a single, hexagonally-shaped
domain wall that fully penetrates the 200-$\mu$m-thick LNO bulk single crystal.
We then determine $n_{2D}$ and $\mu_{H}$ for a broad set of external magnetic
fields $B$, as well as under the variable angular dependence of the Lorentz
force. Lastly, we present photo-Hall measurements of one and the same DW, by
determining the impact of super-bandgap illumination on the 2D charge carrier
density $n_{2D}$.

<h3>MoS$_{2}$/Al$_{0.68}$Sc$_{0.32}$N negative capacitance field-effect  transistors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Al$_{0.68}$Sc$_{0.32}$N (AlScN) has gained attention for its outstanding
ferroelectric properties, including a high coercive field and high remnant
polarization. Although AlScN-based ferroelectric field-effect transistors
(FETs) for memory applications have been demonstrated, a device for logic
applications with minimal hysteresis has not been reported. This study reports
on the transport characteristics of a MoS$_{2}$ negative capacitance FET
(NCFET) based on an AlScN ferroelectric material. We experimentally demonstrate
the effect of a dielectric layer in the gate stack on the memory window and
subthreshold swing (SS) of the NCFET. We show that the hysteresis behavior of
transfer characteristics in the NCFET can be minimized with the inclusion of a
non-ferroelectric dielectric layer, which fulfills the capacitance-matching
condition. Remarkably, we also observe the NC effect in MoS$_{2}$/AlScN NCFETs
arrays based on large-area monolayer MoS$_{2}$ synthesized by chemical vapor
deposition, showing the SS values smaller than its thermionic limit (~36-60
mV/dec) and minimal variation in threshold voltages (< 20 mV).

Pickering emulsions have been widely studied due to their good stability and
potential applications. Nanocellulose including cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs),
cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), and bacterial cellulose nanofibrils (BCNFs) has
emerged as sustainable stabilizers/emulsifiers in food-related Pickering
emulsions due to their favorable properties such as renewability, low toxicity,
amphiphilicity, biocompatibility, and high aspect ratio. Nanocellulose can be
widely obtained from different sources and extraction methods and can
effectively stabilize Pickering emulsions via the irreversible adsorption onto
oil-water interface. The synergistic effects of nanocellulose and other
substances can further enhance the interfacial networks. The
nanocellulose-based Pickering emulsions have potential food-related
applications in delivery systems, food packaging materials, and fat
substitutes. In this review, we highlight key fundamental work and recent
reports on nanocellulose-based Pickering emulsion systems. The sources and
extraction of nanocellulose and the fabrication of nanocellulose-based
Pickering emulsions are briefly summarized. Furthermore, the synergistic
stability and food-related applications of nanocellulose-stabilized Pickering
emulsions are spotlighted.

<h3>Diverse universality classes of the topological deconfinement  transitions of three-dimensional noncompact lattice Abelian-Higgs models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00101" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00101</a>
<br>
<i>Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the topological phase transitions occurring in three-dimensional
(3D) multicomponent lattice Abelian-Higgs (LAH) models, in which an
$N$-component scalar field is minimally coupled with a noncompact Abelian gauge
field, with a global SU($N$) symmetry. Their phase diagram presents a
high-temperature Coulomb (C) phase, and two low-temperature molecular (M) and
Higgs (H) phases, both characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the SU($N$)
symmetry. The molecular-Higgs (MH) and Coulomb-Higgs (CH) transitions are
topological transitions, separating a phase with gapless gauge modes and
confined charges from a phase with gapped gauge modes and deconfined charged
excitations. These transitions are not described by effective
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theories, due to the active role of the gauge modes. We
show that the MH and CH transitions belong to different charged universality
classes. The CH transitions are associated with the $N$-dependent charged fixed
point of the renormalization-group (RG) flow of the 3D Abelian-Higgs field
theory (AHFT). On the other hand, the universality class of the MH transitions
is independent of $N$ and coincides with that controlling the continuous
transitions of the one-component ($N=1$) LAH model. In particular, we verify
that the gauge critical behavior always corresponds to that observed in the 3D
inverted XY model, and that the correlations of an extended charged
gauge-invariant operator (in the Lorenz gauge, this operator corresponds to the
scalar field, thus it is local, justifing the use of the RG framework) have an
$N$-independent critical universal behavior. This scenario is supported by
numerical results for $N=1,\,2,\,25$. The MH critical behavior does not
apparently have an interpretation in terms of the RG flow of the AHFT, as
determined perturbatively close to four dimensions or with standard large-$N$
methods.

<h3>Doped 2D diamond: properties and applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00124</a>
<br>
<i>Bruno Ipaves, JoÃ£o F. Justo, Biplab Sanyal, Lucy V. C. Assali</i>
<br>
<br>
In the present paper, we investigate the structural, thermodynamic, dynamic,
elastic, and electronic properties of doped 2D diamond C$_4$X$_2$ (X = B or N)
nanosheets in both AA$'$A$''$ and ABC stacking configurations, by
first-principles calculations. Those systems are composed of 3 diamond-like
graphene sheets, with an undoped graphene layer between two 50% doped ones. Our
results, based on the analysis of ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations,
phonon dispersion spectra, and Born's criteria for mechanical stability,
revealed that all four structures are stable. Additionally, their standard
enthalpy of formation values are similar to the one of pristine 2D diamond,
recently synthesized by compressing three graphene layers. The C$_4$X$_2$ (X =
B or N) systems exhibit high elastic constant values and stiffness comparable
to the diamond. The C$_4$N$_2$ nanosheets present wide indirect band gaps that
could be advantageous for applications similar to the ones of the hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN), such as a substrate for high-mobility 2D devices. On the
other hand, the C$_4$B$_2$ systems are semiconductors with direct band gaps, in
the 1.6 - 2.0 eV range, and small effective masses, which are characteristics
that may be favorable to high carrier mobility and optoelectronics
applications.

<h3>Pressure sensitivity in non-local flow behaviour of dense hydrogel  particle suspensions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Slowly sheared particulate media like sand and suspensions flow
heterogeneously as they yield via narrow shear bands where most of the strain
is accumulated. Understanding shear band localization from microscopics is
still a major challenge. One class of so-called non-local theories identified
that the width of the shearing zone should depend on the stress field. We
explicitly test this picture by using a uniquely stress-sensitive suspension
while probing its flow behavior in a classic geometry in which shear bands can
be well-tuned: the Split-Bottom Shear Cell (SBSC). The stress-sensitive
suspension is composed of mildly polydisperse soft, slippery hydrogel spheres
submersed in water. We measure their flow profiles and rheology while
controlling the confinement stress via hydrostatic effects and compression. We
determine the average angular velocity profiles in the quasi-static flow regime
using Magnetic Resonance Imaging based particle image velocimetry (MRI-PIV) and
discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We explicitly match a
pressure-sensitive non-local granular fluidity (NGF) model to observed flow
behavior. We find that shear bands for this type of suspension become extremely
broad under the low confining stresses from the almost density-matched fluid
particle mixture, while collapsing to a narrow shear zone under finite,
externally imposed compression levels. The DEM and NGF results match the
observations quantitatively, confirming the conjectured pressure sensitivity
for suspensions and its role in NGF. Our results indicate that pressure
sensitivity should be part of non-local flow rules to describe slow flows of
granular media.

<h3>Classical stochastic representation of quantum mechanics</h3>

<br>

<br>

We show that the dynamics of a quantum system can be represented by the
dynamics of an underlying classical systems obeying the Hamilton equations of
motion. This is achieved by transforming the phase space of dimension $2n$ into
a Hilbert space of dimension $n$ which is obtained by a peculiar canonical
transformation that changes a pair of real canonical variables into a pair of
complex canonical variables which are complex conjugate of each other. The
probabilistic character of quantum mechanics is devised by treating the wave
function as a stochastic variable. The dynamics of the underlying system is
chosen so as to preserve the norm of the state vector.

with the field of Soft Matter but also have unique aspects when the natural
environment is studied.

<h3>Evidence of Pseudogravitational Distortions of the Fermi Surface  Geometry in the Antiferromagnetic Metal FeRh</h3>

<br>
The confluence between high-energy physics and condensed matter has produced
groundbreaking results via unexpected connections between the two traditionally
disparate areas. In this work, we elucidate additional connectivity between
high-energy and condensed matter physics by examining the interplay between
spin-orbit interactions and local symmetry-breaking magnetic order in the
magnetotransport of thin-film magnetic semimetal FeRh. We show that the change
in sign of the normalized longitudinal magnetoresistance observed as a function
of increasing in-plane magnetic field results from changes in the Fermi surface
morphology. We demonstrate that the geometric distortions in the Fermi surface
morphology are more clearly understood via the presence of pseudogravitational
fields in the low-energy theory. The pseudogravitational connection provides
additional insights into the origins of a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in
many common magnetic materials and points to an alternative methodology for
understanding phenomena in locally-ordered materials with strong spin-orbit
interactions.

<h3>Testing theories of the glass transition with the same liquid, but many  kinetic rules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00196" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00196</a>
<br>
<i>Cristina Gavazzoni, Carolina Brito, Matthieu Wyart</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the glass transition by exploring a broad class of kinetic rules
that can significantly modify the normal dynamics of super-cooled liquids,
while maintaining thermal equilibrium. Beyond the usual dynamics of liquids,
this class includes dynamics in which a fraction $(1-f_R)$ of the particles can
perform pairwise exchange or 'swap moves', while a fraction $f_P$ of the
particles can only move along restricted directions. We find that (i) the
location of the glass transition varies greatly but smoothly as $f_P$ and $f_R$
change and (ii) it is governed by a linear combination of $f_P$ and $f_R$.
(iii) Dynamical heterogeneities are not governed by the static structure of the
material. Instead, they are similar at the glass transition across the ($f_R$,
$f_P$) diagram. These observations are negative items for some existing
theories of the glass transition, particularly those reliant on growing
thermodynamic order or locally favored structure, and open new avenues to test
other approaches.

<h3>Realization of the quantum ampere using the quantum anomalous Hall and  Josephson effects</h3>

<br>
<br>
By directly coupling a quantum anomalous Hall resistor to a programmable
Josephson voltage standard, we have implemented a quantum current sensor (QCS)
that operates within a single cryostat in zero magnetic field. Using this QCS
we determine values of current within the range 9.33 nA - 252 nA, providing a
realization of the ampere based on fundamental constants and quantum phenomena.
The relative Type A uncertainty is lowest, 2.30 $\times$10$^{-6}$ A/A, at the
highest current studied, 252 nA. The total root-sum-square combined relative
uncertainty ranges from 3.91 $\times$10$^{-6}$ A/A at 252 nA to 41.2
$\times$10$^{-6}$ A/A at 9.33 nA. No DC current standard is available in the
nanoampere range with relative uncertainty comparable to this, so we assess our
QCS accuracy by comparison to a traditional Ohm's law measurement of the same
current source. We find closest agreement (1.46 $\pm$ 4.28)$\times$10$^{-6}$
A/A for currents near 83.9 nA, for which the highest number of measurements
were made.

<h3>Imaginary phonon modes and phonon-mediated superconductivity in Y2C3</h3>

<br>
<br>
For Y$_2$C$_3$ with a superconducting critical temperature (T$_c$) $\sim$18
K, zone-center imaginary optical phonon modes have been found for the
high-symmetry $I$-$43d$ structure due to C dimer wobbling motion and electronic
instability from a flat band near Fermi energy. After lattice distortion to the
more stable lowest symmetry $P1$ structure, these stabilized low-energy phonon
modes with mixed C and Y characters carry a strong electron-phonon coupling to
give arise to the observed sizable T$_c$. Our work shows that compounds with
the calculated dynamical instability should not be simply excluded in
high-throughput search for new phonon-mediated superconductors.

Organisms often swim through density stratified fluids. In this Letter, we
investigate the dynamics of small active particles swimming in density
gradients and report theoretical evidence of taxis as a result of density
stratification ($\textit{densitaxis}$). Specifically, we calculate the effect
of density stratification on the dynamics of a force-free spherical squirmer
and show that density stratification induces reorientation that tends to align
swimming either parallel or normal to the gradient depending on the swimming
gait. In particular, particles that propel by generating thrust in the front
(pullers) rotate to swim parallel to gradients and hence display (positive or
negative) densitaxis, while particles that propel by generating thrust in the
back (pushers) rotate to swim normal to the gradients. This work could be
useful to understand the motion of marine organisms in ocean, or be leveraged
to sort or organize a suspension of active particles by modulating density
gradients.

Inspired by recent theoretical proposal on the interesting piezomagnetism and
C-paired valley polarization in V2Se2O monolayer, we predict a stable
antiferromagnetic Janus monolayer V2SeTeO with altermagnetic configuration
using density functional theory calculations. It exhibits a novel multi-piezo
effect combining piezoelectric, piezovalley and piezomagnetism. Most
interestingly, the valley polarization and the net magnetization under strain
in V2SeTeO exceed these in V2Se2O, along with the additional large
piezoelectric coefficient of e31 (0.322*10-10 C m-1). The multi-piezo effect
makes antiferromagnetic Janus monolayer V2SeTeO a tantalizing material for
potential applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, spintronics and

Interplay between Rashba spin orbit interaction (SOI) and superconductivity
can give rise to many interesting effects where an in-plane magnetic field is
essential. For instance, for a 2D system with strong Rashba SOI proximity
coupled to a s-wave superconductor, the in-plane magnetic field can drive the
system into a gapless superconducting state while it can also induce a mirage
gap at finite energies for an Ising superconductor while keeping the main gap
at Fermi level intact. We show that when a s-wave superconductor proximitized
to an altermagnet in the absence of SOI and in-plane magnetic field, the
gapless superconducting state with mirage gap can emerge showing d-wave
signature, due to the anisotropic spin splitting of the altermagnet. When the
Rashba SOI is added, the system can turn into a gapped superconductor w ith
mirage gap. Pairing mechanism and transport properties of mirage gap are
investigated. Our result suggests that altermagnet is an ideal platform for
studying gapless superconducting state and mirage gap.

In this article, we report on inelastic neutron scattering measurements on a
quasi-1D antiferromagnet BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ under a transverse magnetic field
applied along the (0,1,0) direction. Combining results of inelastic neutron
scattering experiments, analytical analysis, and numerical simulations, we
precisely studied the $E_8$ excitations appearing in the whole Brillouin zone
at $B_c^{1D}\approx 4.7$ T. The energy scan at $Q=(0,0,2)$ reveals a match
between the data and the theoretical prediction of energies of multiple $E_8$
excitations. Furthermore, dispersions of the lightest three $E_8$ particles
have been clearly observed, confirming the existence of the $E_8$ particles in
BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$. Our results lay down a concrete ground to systematically
study the physics of the exotic $E_8$ particles.

<h3>Sweeny dynamics for the random-cluster model with small $Q$</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The Sweeny algorithm for the $Q$-state random-cluster model in two dimensions
is shown to exhibit a rich mixture of critical dynamical scaling behaviors. As
$Q$ decreases, the so-called critical speeding-up for non-local quantities
becomes more and more pronounced. However, for some quantity of specific local
pattern -- e.g., the number of half faces on the square lattice, we observe
that, as $Q \to 0$, the integrated autocorrelation time $\tau$ diverges as
$Q^{-\zeta}$, with $\zeta \simeq 1/2$, leading to the non-ergodicity of the
Sweeny method for $Q \to 0$. Such $Q$-dependent critical slowing-down,
attributed to the peculiar form of the critical bond weight $v=\sqrt{Q}$, can
be eliminated by a combination of the Sweeny and the Kawasaki algorithm.
Moreover, by classifying the occupied bonds into bridge bonds and backbone
bonds, and the empty bonds into internal-perimeter bonds and external-perimeter
bonds, one can formulate an improved version of the Sweeny-Kawasaki method such
that the autocorrelation time for any quantity is of order $O(1)$.

We study the dynamical quantum phase transition(DQPT) of the Bose-Hubbard
model utilizing recently developed Loschmidt cumulants method. We determine the
complex Loschmidt zeros of the Loschmidt amplitude analogous to the Lee-Yang
zeros of the thermal partition function. We obtain the DQPT critical points
through identifying the crossing points with the imaginary axis. The critical
points show high accuracy when compared to those obtained using the matrix
product states method. In addition, we show that how the critical points of
DQPT can be determined by analyzing the energy fluctuation of the initial
state, making it a valuable tool for future studies in this area. Finally, DQPT
in the extended Bose-Hubbaed model is also investigated.

H-wave is an open-source software package for performing the Hartree--Fock
approximation (HFA) and random phase approximation (RPA) for a wide range of
Hamiltonians of interacting fermionic systems. In HFA calculations, H-wave
examines the stability of several symmetry-broken phases, such as
anti-ferromagnetic and charge-ordered phases, in the given Hamiltonians at zero
and finite temperatures. Furthermore, H-wave calculates the dynamical
susceptibilities using RPA to examine the instability toward the
symmetry-broken phases. By preparing a simple input file for specifying the
Hamiltonians, users can perform HFA and RPA for standard Hamiltonians in
condensed matter physics, such as the Hubbard model and its extensions.
Additionally, users can use a Wannier90-like format to specify fermionic
Hamiltonians. A Wannier90 format is implemented in RESPACK to derive ab initio
Hamiltonians for solids. HFA and RPA for the ab initio Hamiltonians can be
easily performed using H-wave. In this paper, we first explain the basis of HFA
and RPA, and the basic usage of H-wave, including download and installation.
Thereafter, the input file formats implemented in H-wave, including the
Wannier90-like format for specifying the interacting fermionic Hamiltonians,
are discussed. Finally, we present several examples of H-wave such as
zero-temperature HFA calculations for the extended Hubbard model on a square
lattice, finite-temperature HFA calculations for the Hubbard model on a cubic
lattice, and RPA in an extended Hubbard model on a square lattice.

Ultra-low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy
(STM/STS) achieved by dilution refrigeration can provide unrivalled insight
into the local electronic structure of quantum materials and atomic-scale
quantum systems. Effective isolation from mechanical vibration and acoustic
noise is critical in order to achieve ultimate spatial and energy resolution.
Here, we report on the design and performance of an ultra-low vibration (ULV)
laboratory hosting a customized but otherwise commercially available 40mK STM.
The design of the vibration isolation consists of a T-shaped concrete mass
block (55t), suspended by actively controlled pneumatic springs, and placed on
a foundation separated from the surrounding building in a "room-within-a-room"
design. Vibration levels achieved are meeting the VC-M vibration standard at >3
Hz, reached only in a limited number of laboratories worldwide. Measurement of
the STM's junction noise confirms effective vibration isolation on par with
custom built STMs in ULV laboratories. In this tailored low-vibration
environment, the STM achieves an energy resolution of 43ueV (144 mK), promising
for the investigation and control of quantum matter at atomic length scales.

We investigate the occurrence of spontaneous convection in a coaxial cylinder
highly filled with mono-disperse spheres.
To analyze the flow field non-invasively, initial pulses consisting of
colored particles are placed at equal intervals.
By analyzing the spatio-temporal distribution of these pulses, we obtained
axial velocity profiles for both the surface and subsurface regions.
Our advection-diffusion equations with steady advection terms incorporate
experimentally obtained axial velocity profiles in the surface layer, while the
rest of the components are estimated using azimuthal symmetry and volume
conservation.
The validity of our model is confirmed by comparing experimental data with
numerical solutions for both the spatio-temporal distribution and
cross-sectional profile of the colored particles.

Soluble alpha-amylases play an important role in the catabolism of
polysaccharides. In this work, we show that the enzyme can interact with the
lipid membrane and further alter its mechanical properties. Vesicle fluctuation
spectroscopy is used for quantitative measurement of the membrane bending
rigidity of phosphatidylcholines lipid vesicles from the shape fluctuation
based on the whole contour of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs). The bending
rigidity of the lipid vesicles of
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in water increases
significantly with the presence of 0.14 micromolar alpha-amylase in the
exterior solution. However, as the concentration increases above 1 micromolar,
the bending rigidity decreases but remains higher than estimated without the
protein. Contact between the alpha-amylase in the outer solution and the outer
leaflet leads to spontaneous membrane curvature and the corresponding
morphological changes of the GUVs. The presence of outbuds directly
demonstrates that AA has a preferable interaction with the membrane, giving a
positive spontaneous curvature of $C_0 \leq 0.05 \ \mu \rm{m}^{-1}$ at $18 \
\mu$M $(\approx$ 1 mg/ml) of AA concentration. Above 1 mg/ml of AA
concentration the shape of GUVs collapse completely suggesting a highly
convoluted state.

<br>
<br>
Colonies of the social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus go through a
morphological transition from a thin colony of cells to three-dimensional
droplet-like fruiting bodies as a strategy to survive starvation. The
biological pathways that control the decision to form a fruiting body have been
studied extensively. However, the mechanical events that trigger the creation
of multiple cell layers and give rise to droplet formation remain poorly
understood. By measuring cell orientation, velocity, polarity, and force with
cell-scale resolution, we reveal a stochastic local polar order in addition to
the more obvious nematic order. Average cell velocity and active force at
topological defects agree with predictions from active nematic theory, but
their fluctuations are anomalously large due to polar active forces generated
by the self-propelled rod-shaped cells. We find that M. xanthus cells adjust
their reversal frequency to tune the magnitude of this local polar order, which
in turn controls the mechanical stresses and triggers layer formation in the
colonies.

<br>
<br>
Dimensionality plays an essential role in determining the nature and
properties of a physical system. For quantum systems the impact of interactions
and fluctuations is enhanced in lower dimensions, leading to a great diversity
of genuine quantum effects for reduced dimensionality. In most cases, the
dimension is fixed to some integer value. Here, we experimentally probe the
dimensional crossover from two to one dimension using strongly interacting
ultracold bosons in variable lattice potentials and compare the data to
ab-initio theory that takes into account non-homogeneous trapping and non-zero
temperature. From a precise measurement of the momentum distribution we analyze
the characteristic decay of the one-body correlation function in the two
dimensionalities and then track how the decay is modified in the crossover. A
varying two-slope structure is revealed, reflecting the fact that the particles
see their dimensionality as being one or two depending on whether they are
probed on short or long distances, respectively. Our observations demonstrate
how quantum properties in the strongly-correlated regime evolve in the
dimensional crossover as a result of the interplay between dimensionality,
interactions, and temperature.

<h3>Crystallization Dynamics of Amorphous Yttrium Iron Garnet Thin Films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is a prototypical material in spintronics due to
its exceptional magnetic properties. To exploit these properties high quality
thin films need to be manufactured. Deposition techniques like sputter
deposition or pulsed laser deposition at ambient temperature produce amorphous
films, which need a post annealing step to induce crystallization. However, not
much is known about the exact dynamics of the formation of crystalline YIG out
of the amorphous phase. Here, we conduct extensive time and temperature series
to study the crystallization behavior of YIG on various substrates and extract
the crystallization velocities as well as the activation energies needed to
promote crystallization. We find that the type of crystallization as well as
the crystallization velocity depend on the lattice mismatch to the substrate.
We compare the crystallization parameters found in literature with our results
and find an excellent agreement with our model. Our results allow us to
determine the time needed for the formation of a fully crystalline film of
arbitrary thickness for any temperature.

<h3>Density functional theory study on effect of NO annealing for SiC(0001)  surface with atomic-scale steps</h3>

<br>
<br>
Density functional theory calculations for the electronic structures of the
4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface with atomic-scale steps are carried out to
investigate the effect of NO annealing. The characteristic behavior of the
conduction band edge states of SiC is strongly affected over a wide area of the
interface by the Coulomb interaction of the O atoms in the SiO$_2$ region as
well as the step structure of the interface, resulting in the discontinuity of
the inversion layers at the step edges under the gate bias. The spatially
discontinued band only allows the very limited conduction paths in the
inversion layer, leading to the significantly decreased mobile carrier density.
It is found that the Coulomb interaction of the O atoms is screened and the
inversion layers become continuous when the nitrided layers are inserted at the
interface by NO annealing. This result is in good agreement with experimental
findings that the improvement of the performance of SiC
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors by NO annealing is
attributed to an increase in the mobile electron density rather than an
increase in the mobility of electrons in the inversion layer.

<h3>Ab-initio Study of Electronic and Lattice Dynamical Properties of  monolayer ZnO under Strain</h3>

<br>
<br>
First-principles density functional theory based calculations have been
performed to investigate the strain-induced modifications in the electronic and
vibrational properties of monolayer (ML) ZnO. Wide range of in-plane tensile
and compressive strains along different directions are applied to analyse the
modifications in detail. The electronic band gap reduces under both tensile and
compressive strains and a direct to indirect band gap transition occurs for
high values of biaxial tensile strain. The relatively low rate of decrease of
band gap and large required strain for direct to indirect band gap transition
compared to other $2$D materials are analysed. Systematic decrease in the
frequency of the in-plane and increase in the out-of-plane optical phonon modes
with increasing tensile strain are observed. The in-plane acoustic modes show
linear dispersion for unstrained as well as strained cases. However, the
out-of-plane acoustic mode (ZA), which shows quadratic dispersion in the
unstrained condition, turns linear with strain. The dispersion of the ZA mode
is analysed using the shell elasticity theory and the possibility of ripple
formation with strain is analysed. The strain-induced linearity of the ZA mode
indicates the absence of rippling under strain. Finally, the stability limit of
ML-ZnO is investigated and found that for $18\%$ biaxial tensile strain the
structure shows instability with the emergence of imaginary phonon modes.
Furthermore, the potential of ML-ZnO to be a good thermoelectric material is
analyzed in an intuitive way based on the calculated electronic and phononic
properties. Our results, thus, not only highlight the significance of
strain-engineering in tailoring the electronic and vibrational properties but
also provide a thorough understanding of the lattice dynamics and mechanical
strength of ML-ZnO.

<h3>Field-Emission Resonances in Thin Metallic Films: Nonexponential Decay  of the Tunneling Current as a Function of the Sample-to-Tip Distance</h3>

<br>
<br>
Field-emission resonances (FERs) for two-dimensional Pb(111) islands grown on
\mbox{Si(111)7$\times$7} surfaces were studied by low-temperature scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) in a broad range of tunneling
conditions with both active and disabled feedback loop. These FERs exist at
quantized sample-to-tip distances $Z^{\,}_n$ above the sample surface, where
$n$ is the serial number of the FER state. By recording the trajectory of the
STM tip during ramping of the bias voltage $U$ (while keeping the tunneling
current $I$ fixed), we obtain the set of the $Z^{\,}_n$ values corresponding to
local maxima in the derived $dZ/dU(U)$ spectra. This way, the continuous
evolution of $Z^{\,}_n$ as a function of $U$ for all FERs was investigated by
STS experiments with active feedback loop for different $I$. Complementing
these measurements by current-distance spectroscopy at a fixed $U$, we could
construct a 4-dimensional $I-U-Z-dZ/dU$ diagram, that allows us to investigate
the geometric localization of the FERs above the surface. We demonstrate that
(i) the difference $\delta Z^{\,}_n=Z^{\,}_{n+1}-Z^{\,}_n$ between neighboring
FER lines in the $Z-U$ diagram is independent of $n$ for higher resonances,
(ii) the $\delta Z^{\,}_{n}$ value decreases as $U$ increases; (iii) the
quantized FER states lead to the \emph{periodic} variations of $\ln I$ as a
function of $Z$ with periodicity $\delta Z$; (iv) the periodic variations in
the $\ln I - Z$ spectra allows to estimate the absolute height of the tip above
the sample surface. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding on how
the FER states affect various types of tunneling spectroscopy experiments and
how they lead to a non-exponential decay of the tunneling current as a function
of $Z$ at high bias voltages in the regime of quantized electron emission.

<h3>Beyond-mean-field theory for the statistics of neural coordination</h3>

Understanding the coordination structure of neurons in neuronal networks is
essential for unraveling the distributed information processing mechanisms in
brain networks. Recent advancements in measurement techniques have resulted in
an increasing amount of data on neural activities recorded in parallel,
revealing largely heterogeneous correlation patterns across neurons. Yet, the
mechanistic origin of this heterogeneity is largely unknown because existing
theoretical approaches linking structure and dynamics in neural circuits are
mostly restricted to average connection patterns. Here we present a systematic
inclusion of variability in network connectivity via tools from statistical
physics of disordered systems. We study networks of spiking leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons and employ mean-field and linear-response methods to
map the spiking networks to linear rate models with an equivalent
neuron-resolved correlation structure. The latter models can be formulated in a
field-theoretic language that allows using disorder-average and replica
techniques to systematically derive quantitatively matching beyond-mean-field
predictions for the mean and variance of cross-covariances as functions of the
average and variability of connection patterns. We show that heterogeneity in
covariances is not a result of variability in single-neuron firing statistics
but stems from the sparse realization and variable strength of connections, as
ubiquitously observed in brain networks. Average correlations between neurons
are found to be insensitive to the level of heterogeneity, which in contrast
modulates the variability of covariances across many orders of magnitude,
giving rise to an efficient tuning of the complexity of coordination patterns
in neuronal circuits.

<h3>Hydrostatic Pressure Induced Anomalous Enhancement in the Thermoelectric  Performance of Monolayer MoS$_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00423</a>

<br>
<br>
The hydrostatic pressure induced changes in the transport properties of
monolayer (ML) MoS$_2$ have been investigated using first-principles density
functional theory based calculations. The application of pressure induces shift
in the conduction band minimum (CBM) from K to $\Lambda$, while retaining the
band extrema at K in around the same energy at a pressure of 10 GPa. This
increase in valley degeneracy is found to have a significant impact on the
electronic transport properties of ML-MoS$_2$ via enhancement of the
thermopower (S) by up to 140\% and power factor (S$^{2}$$\sigma$/$\tau$) by up
to 310\% at 300 K. Besides, the very low deformation potential (E$_\text{DP}$)
associated with the CB-$\Lambda$ valley results in a remarkably high electronic
mobility ($\mu$) and relaxation time ($\tau$). Additionally, the application of
pressure reduces the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity
($\kappa_\text{L}$) by 20\% of its unstrained value, owing to the increased
anharmonicity and resulting increase in the intrinsic phonon scattering rates.
The hydrostatic pressure induced increase in power factor (S$^{2}$$\sigma$) and
the decrease in $\kappa_\text{L}$ act in unison to result in a substantial
improvement in the overall thermoelectric performance (zT) of ML-MoS$_2$. At
900 K with an external pressure of 25 GPa, zT values of 1.63 and 1.21 are
obtained for electron and hole doping, respectively, which are significantly
higher compared to the zT values at zero pressure. For the implementation in a
thermoelectric module where both n-type and p-type legs should be preferably
made of the same material, the concomitant increase in zT of ML-MoS$_2$ for
both types of doping with hydrostatic pressure can be highly beneficial.

<h3>Ultrafast magnetization enhancement and spin current injection in  magnetic multilayers by exciting the nonmagnetic metal</h3>

<br>
<br>
A systematic investigation of spin injection behavior in Au/FM (FM = Fe and
Ni) multilayers is performed using the superdiffusive spin transport theory. By
exciting the nonmagnetic layer, the laser-induced hot electrons may transfer
spin angular momentum into the adjacent ferromagnetic (FM) metals resulting in
ultrafast demagnetization or enhancement. We find that these experimental
phenomena sensitively depend on the particular interface reflectivity of hot
electrons and may reconcile the different observations in experiment.
Stimulated by the ultrafast spin currents carried by the hot electrons, we
propose the multilayer structures to generate highly spin polarized currents
for development of future ultrafast spintronics devices. The spin polarization
of the electric currents carried by the hot electrons can be significantly
enhanced by the joint effects of bulk and interfacial spin filtering. Meanwhile
the intensity of the generated spin current can be optimized by varying the
number of repeated stacking units and the thickness of each metallic layer.

Using first-principles DFT calculations, we analyze the origin of the
different crystal structures, optical and magnetic properties of two basic
families of layered fluoride materials with formula A2MF4 (M = Ag, Cu, Ni, Mn;
A = K, Cs, Rb). On one hand, Cs2AgF4 and K2CuF4 compounds (both with d9 metal
cations) crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with Cmca space group and MA
- F - MB bridge angle of 180, and they exhibit a weak ferromagnetism (FM) in
the layer plane. On the other hand, K2NiF4 or K2MnF4 compounds (with d8 and d5
metal cations, respectively) have a tetragonal I4/mmm space group with 180
bridge angle and exhibit antiferromagnetism (AFM) in the layer plane. Firstly,
we show that, contrary to what is claimed in the literature, the Cmca structure
of Cs2AgF4 and K2CuF4 is not related to a cooperative Jahn-Teller effect among
elongated MF64- units. Instead, first-principles calculations carried out in
the I4/mmm parent phase of these two compounds show that MF64- units are
axially compressed because the electrostatic potential from the rest of lattice
ions force the hole to lie in the 3z2 - r2 molecular orbital (z being
perpendicular to the layer plane). This fact increases the metal-ligand
distance in the layer plane and makes that covalency in the bridging ligand has
a residual character (clearly smaller than in K2NiF4 or KNiF3) stabilizing for
only a few meV (7.9 meV for Cs2AgF4) an AFM order. However, this I4/mmm parent
phase of Cs2AgF4 is unstable thus evolving towards the experimental Cmca
structure with an energy gain of 140 meV, FM ordering and orthorhombic MF64-
units.

<h3>Distinguishing dynamical quantum criticality through local fidelity  distances</h3>

<br>
Using local quantum fidelity distances, we study the dynamical quantum phase
transition in integrable and non-integrable one-dimensional Ising chains.
Unlike the Loschmidt echo, the standard measure for distinguishing between two
quantum states to describe the dynamical quantum phase transition, the local
fidelity requires only a part of the system to characterize it. The
non-analyticities in the quantum distance between two subsystem density
matrices identify the critical time and the corresponding critical exponent
reasonably well in a finite-size system. Moreover, we propose a distance
measure from the upper bound of the local quantum fidelity for certain quench
protocols where the entanglement entropy features oscillatory growth in time.
This local distance encodes the difference between the eigenvalue distribution
of the initial and quenched subsystem density matrices and quantifies the
critical properties. The alternative distance measure could be employed to
examine the dynamical quantum phase transitions in a broader range of models,
with implications for gaining insights into the transition from the
entanglement perspective.

Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures which are envisioned as
nanometre scale information carriers in magnetic memory and logic devices. The
recent demonstration of room temperature stabilization of skyrmions and their
current induced manipulation in industry compatible ultrathin films were first
steps towards the realisation of such devices. However, important challenges
remain regarding the electrical detection and the low-power nucleation of
skyrmions, which are required for the read and write operations. Here, we
demonstrate, using operando magnetic microscopy experiments, the electrical
detection of a single magnetic skyrmion in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) and
its nucleation and annihilation by gate voltage via voltage control of magnetic
anisotropy. The nucleated skyrmion can be further manipulated by both gate
voltage and external magnetic field, leading to tunable intermediate resistance
states. Our results unambiguously demonstrate the readout and voltage
controlled write operations in a single MTJ device, which is a major milestone
for low power skyrmion based technologies.

The derivation of determinant representations for the space-, time-, and
temperature-dependent correlation functions of the impenetrable Gaudin-Yang
model in the presence of a trapping potential is presented. These
representations are valid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios like
the ones initiated by a sudden change of the confinement potential. In the
equal-time case our results are shown to be equivalent to a multicomponent
generalization of Lenard's formula from which Painlev\'e transcendent
representations for the correlators can be obtained in the case of harmonic
trapping and Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For a system in the
quantum Newton's cradle setup the determinant representations allow for an
exact numerical investigation of the dynamics and even hydrodynamization which
is outside the reach of Generalized Hydrodynamics or other approximate methods.
In the case of a sudden change in the trap's frequency we predict a many-body
bounce effect, not present in the evolution of the density profile, which
causes a nontrivial periodic narrowing of the momentum distribution with
amplitude depending on the statistics of the particles.

Hybrid peroskite solar cells are newly emergent high-performance photovoltaic
devices, which suffer from disadvantages such as toxic elements, short-term
stabilities, and so on. Searching for alternative perovskites with high
photovoltaic performances and thermally stabilities is urgent in this field. In
this work, stimulated by the recently proposed materials-genome initiative
project, firstly we build classical machine-learning algorithms for the models
of formation energies, bangdaps and Deybe temperatures for hybrid
organic-inorganic double perovskites, then we choose the high-precision models
to screen a large scale of double-perovskite chemical space, to filter out good
pervoskite candidates for solar cells. We also analyze features of importances
for the the three target properties to reveal the underlying mechanisms and
discover the typical characteristics of high-performances double perovskites.
Secondly we adopt the Crystal graph convolution neural network (CGCNN), to
build precise model for bandgaps of perovskites for further filtering. Finally
we use the ab-initio method to verify the results predicted by the CGCNN
method, and find that, six out of twenty randomly chosen (CH3)2NH2-based HOIDP
candidates possess finite bandgaps, and especially, (CH3)2NH2AuSbCl6 and
(CH3)2NH2CsPdF6 possess the bandgaps of 0.633 eV and 0.504 eV, which are
appropriate for photovoltaic applications. Our work not only provides a large
scale of potential high-performance double-perovskite candidates for futural
experimental or theoretical verification, but also showcases the effective and
powerful prediction of the combined ML and CGCNN method proposed for the first
time here.

We analyze a mean-field model for mixtures involving biaxial nematogens and

interactions between nematogens, but also orientational nematogen-nanoparticle
interactions. We determine bulk equilibrium phase diagrams for a wide range of
interaction strengths, identifying in each case the effect of the nanoparticles

points. Special attention is given to the limit of low concentration of
nanoparticles, in which their effect on the temperatures of both the
first-order uniaxial-isotropic and the continuous biaxial-uniaxial transitions
is investigated in detail.

<h3>Influence of Hydration and Dehydration on the Viscoelastic Properties of  Snail Mucus by Brillouin Spectroscopy</h3>

Brillouin spectroscopy was used to probe the viscoelastic properties of
diluted snail mucus at GHz frequencies over the range -11 $^\circ$C $\leq T
\leq$ 52 $^\circ$C and of dehydrated mucus as a function of time. Two peaks
were observed in the spectra for diluted mucus: the longitudinal acoustic mode
of the liquid mucus peak varies with dilution but fluctuates around the typical
value of 8.0 GHz. A second peak due to ice remained unchanged with varying
dilution and was seen at 18.0 GHz and appeared below the dilutions "freezing"
point depression. Only a single peak was found in all the dehydrated mucus
spectra and was also attributed to the longitudinal acoustic mode of liquid
mucus. Anomalous changes in the protein concentration dependence of the
frequency shift, linewidth, and ``freezing" point depression and consequently,
hypersound velocity, compressibility, and apparent viscosity suggest that the
viscoelastic properties of this system is influenced by the presence of water.
Furthermore, this research uncovered three unique transitions within the
molecular structure. These transitions included the first stage of glycoprotein
cross-linking, followed by the steady depletion of free water in the system,
and eventually resulted in the creation of a gel-like state when all remaining
free water was evaporated.

We present a comprehensive numerical study of the phase behavior and dynamics
of a three-dimensional active dumbbell system with attractive interactions. We
demonstrate that attraction is essential for the system to exhibit nontrivial
phases.We construct a detailed phase diagram by exploring the effects of the
system's activity, density, and attraction strength. We identify several
distinct phases, including a disordered, a gel, and a completely
phase-separated phase. Additionally, we discover a novel dynamical phase, that
we name percolating network, which is characterized by the presence of a
spanning network of connected dumbbells. In the phase-separated phase we
characterize numerically and describe analytically the helical motion of the
dense cluster.

The relation between wetting properties and geometric parameters of fractal
surfaces are widely discussed on the literature and, however, there are still
divergences on this topic. Here we propose a simple theoretical model to
describe the wetting properties of a droplet of water placed on a hierarchical
structured surface and test the predictions of the model and the dependence of
the droplet wetting state on the initial conditions using simulation of the
3-spin Potts model. We show that increasing the auto-similarity level of the
hierarchy -- called $n$ -- does not affect considerably the stable wetting
state of the droplet but increases its contact angle. Simulations also explicit
the existence of metastable states on this type of surfaces and shows that,
when $n$ increases, the metastability becomes more pronounced. Finally we show
that the fractal dimension of the surface is not a good predictor of the
contact angle of the droplet.

<h3>Correlated two-Leviton states in the fractional quantum Hall regime</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider a two-dimensional electron system in the Laughlin sequence of the
fractional quantum Hall regime to investigate the effect of strong correlations
on the mutual interaction between two Levitons, single-electron excitations
generated by trains of quantized Lorentzian pulses. We focus on two-Leviton
states injected in a single period with a time separation $\Delta t$. In the
presence of a quantum point contact operating in the weak-backscattering
regime, we compute the backscattered charge by means of the Keldysh technique.
In the limit of an infinite period and zero temperature, we show that the
backscattered charge for a two-Leviton state is not equal to twice the
backscattered charge for a single Leviton. We present an interpretation for
this result in terms of the wave-packet formalism for Levitons, thus proposing
that an effective interaction between the two Levitons is induced by the
strongly-correlated background. Finally, we perform numerical calculations in
the periodic case by using the Floquet formalism for photo-assisted transport.
By varying the system parameters such as pulse width, filling factor and
temperature we show that the value of the backscattered charge for two-Leviton
states is strongly dependent on the pulse separation, thus opening scenarios
where the effective interaction between Levitons can be controllably tuned.

<h3>Hyperdiffusion of Poissonian run-and-tumble particles in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00554" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00554</a>

<i>Yurim Jung</i>
<br>
<br>
We study non-interacting Poissonian run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in two
dimensions whose velocity orientations are controlled by an arbitrary circular
distribution $Q(\phi)$. RTP-type active transport has been reported to undergo
localization inside crowded and disordered environments, yet its
non-equilibrium dynamics, especially at intermediate times, has not been
elucidated analytically. Here, starting from the standard (one-state) RTPs, we
formulate the localized (two-state) RTPs by concatenating an overdamped
Brownian motion in a Markovian manner. Using the space-time coupling technique
in continuous-time random walk theory, we generalize the Montroll-Weiss formula
in a decomposable form over the Fourier coefficient $Q_{\nu}$ and reveal that
the displacement moment $\left \langle \mathbf{r}^{2\mu}(t) \right \rangle$
depends on finite angular moments $Q_{\nu}$ for $|\nu|\leq \mu$. Based on this
finding, we provide (i) the angular distribution of velocity reorientation for
one-state RTPs and (ii) $\left \langle \mathbf{r}^{2}(t) \right \rangle$ over
all timescales for two-state RTPs. In particular, we find the intricate time
evolution of $\left \langle \mathbf{r}^{2}(t) \right \rangle$ that depends on
initial dynamic states and, remarkably, detect hyperdiffusive scaling $\left
\langle \mathbf{r}^{2}(t) \right \rangle \propto t^{\beta(t)}$ with an
anomalous exponent $2<\beta(t)\leq 3$ in the short- and intermediate-time
regimes. Our work suggests that the localization emerging within complex
systems can increase the dispersion rate of active transport even beyond the
ballistic limit.

<h3>Lee-Yang zeros at $O(3)$ and deconfined quantum critical points</h3>

<i>Jonathan D'Emidio</i>
<br>
<br>
Lee-Yang theory, based on the study of zeros of the partition function, is
widely regarded as a powerful and complimentary approach to the study of
critical phenomena and forms a foundational part of the theory of phase
transitions. Its widespread use, however, is complicated by the fact that it
requires introducing complex-valued fields that create an obstacle for many
numerical methods, especially in the quantum case where very limited studies
exist beyond one dimension. Here we present a simple and statistically exact
method to compute partition function zeros with general complex-valued external
fields in the context of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We
demonstrate the power of this approach by extracting critical exponents from
the leading Lee-Yang zeros of 2D quantum antiferromagnets with a complex
staggered field, focusing on the Heisenberg bilayer and square-lattice $J$-$Q$
models. The method also allows us to introduce a complex field that couples to
valence bond solid order, where we observe extended rings of zeros in the
$J$-$Q$ model with purely imaginary staggered and valence bond solid fields.

<h3>Probability density function of the unbalanced impulse in Langevin  theory of Brownian motion</h3>

This paper attempts to find a probability distribution for the white noise
(rapidly fluctuating unbalanced force) in the Langevin Equation. Unbalanced
force is the resultant impulse provided to the brownian particle by the
colliding fluid molecules. Therefore, a probability distribution of the speed
of the particles after each impact will have the same probability distribution
of the white noise. Such a distribution is discovered in this work by
constructing a simple model based on thermal molecules colliding with the
particle from all directions. The molecules obey Maxwell-Boltzmann speed
distribution law. At low temperatures, for bigger brownian particles, existence
of some non-random distribution for the unbalanced impulse, in itself is an
interesting result. The distribution takes a near half gaussian form at these
limits. At high temperatures, for small brownian particles(e.g: pollen grains),
the distribution is shown to approach uniform distribution, and hence
consistent with bulk of well established theoretical assumptions and
experimental results in the literature that claims the unbalanced force to be a
random white noise.

This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor K. Alex Muller. After
describing our personal and scientific encounters since 1974, I concentrate on
the many puzzles whinch appeared in our discussions and collaborations,
involving the interplay between theory and experiments on the critical behavior
of cubic perovskites which undergo (second or first) order transitions to a
lower symmetry phases (trigonal or tetragonal). The conclusion, reached only
very recently, is that (although beginning with the same cubic symmetry) the
two types of transitions belong to two distinct universality classes: under
[100] stress, the cubic to trigonal transition exhibits a tetracritical phase
diagram, with cubic exponents, while the cubic to tetragonal transition exhibit
an intermediate bicritical phase diagram, but asymptotically the bicritical
point turns into a triple point, with three first order lines. To test these
conclusions, it is suggested to measure the effective critical exponents as the
temperature approaches criticality.

<h3>On the transport of CO$_2$ through humidified facilitated transport  membranes</h3>

Membrane-based CO$_2$ removal from exhaust streams has recently gained much
attention as a means of reducing emissions and limiting climate change. Novel
membranes for CO$_2$ removal include so called facilitated transport membranes
(FTMs), which offer very high selectivities for CO$_2$ while maintaining decent
permeabilities. Recently, these FTMs have been scaled up from laboratory level
to plant-sized pilot modules with promising results. However, the molecular
details of CO$_2$ transport in these has not yet been fully unraveled. In this
work, experimental studies were combined with quantum-mechanical ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the underlying molecular
mechanism of CO$_2$ permeation through FTMs. Various compositions of polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) as the membrane matrix with polyvinyl amine (PVAm),
monoethanolamine (MEA), or 4-amino-1-butanol (BA) as carrier molecules were
experimentally tested. Our experiments revealed that water was essential for
the CO$_2$ transport and a transport superposition was achieved with a mixed
composition of PVAm and MEA in PVA. Furthermore, sorption measurements with PVA
were conducted with humidified N$_2$ and CO$_2$ to quantify water
sorption-induced swelling and its contribution to the gas uptake. As the
carbonic acid--amine interaction is assumed to cause transport facilitation,
electronic structure-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were
conducted to study the transport of CO$_2$ in the form of carbonic acid along
PVAm polymer chains. In particular, the necessity of local water for transport
facilitation was studied at different water contents. The simulations show that
transport is fastest in the system with low water content and does not happen
in the absence of water.

Optical spectroscopy of quantum materials at ultralow temperatures is rarely
explored, yet it may provide critical characterizations of quantum phases not
possible using other approaches. We describe the development of a novel
experimental platform that enables optical spectroscopic studies, together with
standard electronic transport, of materials at millikelvin temperatures inside
a dilution refrigerator. The instrument is capable of measuring both bulk
crystals and micron-sized two-dimensional van der Waals materials and devices.
We demonstrate the performance by implementing photocurrent-based Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy on a monolayer WTe$_2$ device and a multilayer
1T-TaS$_2$ crystal, with a spectral range available from near-infrared to
terahertz range and in magnetic fields up to 5 T. In the far-infrared regime,
we achieve spectroscopic measurements at a base temperature as low as ~ 43 mK
and a sample electron temperature of ~ 450 mK. Possible experiments and
potential future upgrades of this versatile instrumental platform are
envisioned.

High-aspect-ratio mechanical resonators are pivotal in precision sensing,
from macroscopic gravitational wave detectors to nanoscale acoustics. However,
fabrication challenges and high computational costs have limited the
length-to-thickness ratio of these devices, leaving a largely unexplored regime
in nano-engineering. We present for the first time nanomechanical resonators
that extend centimeters in length yet retain nanometer thickness. We explore
this new design space using an optimization approach which judiciously employs
fast millimeter-scale simulations to steer the more computationally intensive
centimeter-scale design optimization. The synergy between nanofabrication,
design optimization guided by machine learning, and precision engineering opens
a solid-state approach to room temperature quality factors of 10 billion at
kilohertz mechanical frequencies -- comparable to extreme performance of
leading cryogenic resonators and levitated nanospheres, even under
significantly less stringent temperature and vacuum conditions.

<h3>Bandgap formation patterns and closing conditions in phononic crystals</h3>

Bandgaps, or frequency ranges of forbidden wave propagation, are a hallmark
of Phononic Crystals (PnCs). Unlike their lattice counterparts, PnCs taking the
form of continuous structures exhibit an infinite number of bandgaps of varying
location, bandwidth, and distribution along the frequency spectrum. While these
bandgaps are commonly predicted from benchmark tools such as the Bloch-wave
theory, the conditions that dictate the patterns associated with bandgap
symmetry, attenuation, or even closing in multi-bandgap PnCs remain an enigma.
In this work, we establish these patterns in one-dimensional rods undergoing
longitudinal motion via a canonical transfer-matrix-based approach. In doing
so, we connect the conditions underpinning bandgap emergence and closing to
their physical origins in the context of the Bragg condition (for infinite
media) and natural resonances (for finite counterparts). The developed
framework uniquely characterizes individual bandgaps within a larger dispersion
spectrum regardless of their parity (i.e., odd vs even bandgaps) or location
(low vs high-frequency), by exploiting dimensionless constants of the PnC unit
cell which quantify the different contrasts between its constitutive layers.
These developments are detailed for a bi-layered PnC and then generalized for a
PnC of any number of layers by increasing the model complexity. We envision
this mathematical development to be a future standard for the development of
hierarchically-structured PnCs with prescribed and finely tailored bandgap
profiles.

Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the standard method for
first-principles calculations in computational chemistry and materials science.
More accurate theories such as the random-phase approximation (RPA) are limited
in application due to their large computational cost. Here, we construct a DFT
substitute functional for the RPA using supervised and unsupervised machine
learning (ML) techniques. Our ML-RPA model can be interpreted as a non-local
extension to the standard gradient approximation. We train an ML-RPA functional
for diamond surfaces and liquid water and show that ML-RPA can outperform the
standard gradient functionals in terms of accuracy. Our work demonstrates how
ML-RPA can extend the applicability of the RPA to larger system sizes, time
scales and chemical spaces.

The formation and dynamics of swarms is wide spread in living systems, from
bacterial bio-films to schools of fish and flocks of birds. We study this
emergent collective behavior in a model of active Brownian particles with
visual-perception-induced steering and alignment interactions through
agent-based simulations. The dynamics, shape, and internal structure of the
emergent aggregates, clusters, and swarms of these intelligent active Brownian
particles (iABPs) is determined by the maneuverabilities $\Omega_v$ and
$\Omega_a$, quantifying the steering based on the visual signal and polar
alignment, respectively, the propulsion velocity, characterized by the
P{\'e}clet number $Pe$, the vision angle $\theta$, and the orientational noise.
Various non-equilibrium dynamical aggregates -- like motile worm-like swarms
and millings, and close-packed or dispersed clusters -- are obtained. Small
vision angles imply the formation of small clusters, while large vision angles
lead to more complex clusters. In particular, a strong polar-alignment
maneuverability $\Omega_a$ favors elongated worm-like swarms, which display
super-diffusive motion over a much longer time range than individual ABPs,
whereas a strong vision-based maneuverability $\Omega_v$ favors compact, nearly
immobile aggregates. Swarm trajectories show long persistent directed motion,
interrupted by sharp turns. Milling rings, where a worm-like swarm bites its
own tail, emerge for an intermediate regime of $Pe$ and vision angles. Our
results offer new insights into the behavior of animal swarms, and provide
design criteria for swarming microbots.

A recent paper [Lee {\em et al.}, J. Korean Cryt. Growth Cryst. Techn. {\bf

Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O with $x\approx 1$, coined LK-99, might be a
room-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure. Our density-functional
theory calculations show lattice parameters and a volume contraction with $x$
-- very similar to experiment. The DFT electronic structure shows Cu$^{2+}$ in
a $3d^9$ configuration with two extremely flat Cu bands crossing the Fermi
energy. This puts Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O in an ultra-correlated regime and
suggests that, without doping, it is a Mott or charge transfer insulator. If
doped such an electronic structure might support flat-band superconductivity or
an correlation-enhanced electron-phonon mechanism, whereas a diamagnet without
superconductivity appears to be rather at odds with our results.

We present a comprehensive study on the structure and optical properties of
Mn-and Co-doped ZnO samples prepared via solid-state reaction method with
different dopant concentrations and atmospheres. The samples were structural
and chemically characterized via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray excited
photoelectron spectroscopy. The optical characterization was performed via
Raman, photoluminescence, and diffuse photoreflectance spectroscopies. Emphasis
was done on the studies of their vibrational properties. The structural data
confirm the incorporation of Mn and Co ions into the wurtzite ZnO lattice. It
is demonstrated that the usual observed additional bands in the Raman spectrum
of transitional metal (TM) doped ZnO are related to structural damage, deriving
from the doping process, and surface effects. The promoted surface optical
phonons (SOP) are of Fr\"ohlich character and, together with the longitudinal
optical (LO) polar phonons, are directly dependent on the ZnO electronic
structure. The enhancement of SOP and LO modes with TM-doping is explained in
terms of nonhomogeneous doping, with the dopants concentrating mainly on the
surface of grains, and a resonance effect due to the decrease of the ZnO
bandgap promoted by the introduction of the 3d TM levels within the ZnO
bandgap. We also discuss the origin of the controversial vibrational mode
commonly observed in the Mn-doped ZnO system. It is stated that the observation
of the analyzed vibrational properties is a signature of substitutional doping
of the ZnO structure with tuning of ZnO optical absorption into the visible
range of the electromagnetic spectrum.

<br>
<br>
Here, based upon density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we present the
basic electronic structure of CuPb9(PO4)6O (Cu-doped lead apatite), showing
that the low energy (near-Fermilevel) states are dominated by Cu-O hybrid
states. The filling of these states is nominally d$^{9}$, consistent with the
standard Cu$^{2+}$ valence state. We find these states to be unusually flat (~
0.2 eV dispersion), giving a very high density of electronic states (DOS) at
the Fermi level that we argue can be a host for novel electronic physics,
including potentially room temperature superconductivity. The states are in
general sensitive to symmetry-lowering gapping possibilities that would remove
the spectral weight from EF, but could be protected from this by
disorder/doping heterogeneity in a real material. Importantly, this disorder is
expected to be less damaging to superconductivity. Further, we claim that the
emergence of these flat bands should be due to weak wavefunction overlap
between the orbitals on Cu and O sites, owing to to the directional character
of the constituent orbitals. Therefore, finding an appropriate host structure
for minimizing hybridization between Cu and O while allowing them to still
weakly interact should be a promising route for generating flat bands at EF and
very high temperature superconductivity, regardless of whether LK-99 is such a
realization.
